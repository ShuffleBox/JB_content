WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.100
I tell you what it's one of them. It's one of them things that a girl goes through although although just to add insult to

00:06.100 --> 00:10.940
Injury, I can't seem to actually build. Oh geez now. I just disappeared. I can't seem to actually build a right-click it so

00:11.460 --> 00:13.460
And now I clicked on a menu

00:13.700 --> 00:15.340
that

00:15.340 --> 00:19.420
Existed for a plasma what I deleted and now the whole interface is locked up well shit

00:19.420 --> 00:21.860
I had so many nice things to say and now my whole UI is locked up

00:21.860 --> 00:24.860
But I got like a bajillion tabs open. I don't want to reset all those up, and I'm oh

00:25.900 --> 00:27.340
man

00:27.340 --> 00:32.380
And then I watch the icon little die. What what what just happened? What just happened?

00:32.380 --> 00:35.500
I think plasma desktop is just going crazy on me my screen just went blank

00:36.700 --> 00:39.760
Too many features something damn man that sucks

00:40.020 --> 00:44.860
You know every time I get to a point where I'm like this is it and then then something happens to me in production

00:44.860 --> 00:48.620
I'm like shit. I can't use this. This is no good. This is no good

00:48.620 --> 00:52.460
And you know it's really what really sucks is now. I think I'm getting the point where I'm gonna have to restart X

00:52.460 --> 00:58.980
Hmm, which could screw up HDMI capture which could mess up the stream is gonna close all my tabs which Chrome will likely reopen

00:58.980 --> 01:02.100
But I had things played and paused in certain positions

01:02.100 --> 01:05.620
I had certain pages zoomed in like I took about 15 minutes saying all that up

01:05.620 --> 01:08.800
So I'm gonna lose about 15 minutes of work, and I may lose HDMI capture

01:09.580 --> 01:14.060
Slow down before you do that. I tell you why to restart only plasma 5 there is oh yeah

01:14.060 --> 01:19.500
Well if if it could take input, but well, maybe I could try also to get all tough to and it will always work

01:19.500 --> 01:24.380
Ah, and I just gotta get you the command can give it to me. I'll tell you what this is no good

01:24.380 --> 01:30.700
This is no good. No good because it always happens to me when I'm messing around with plasmoids. That's always when it happens

01:31.140 --> 01:35.180
It's just you like that word though. I don't even know if I'm saying I'm right. There's plasma widgets

01:36.100 --> 01:41.220
All right, so there is a command to restart plasma 5 yes. Yes. I'm just grabbing it

01:42.220 --> 01:46.620
Don't go whoa whoa whoa look at that. There's Chrome so apparently the well

01:46.620 --> 01:49.520
I'm using a totally different task switcher all of a sudden look at that. It's the one on the side

01:50.620 --> 01:53.120
Wow, so there's all my tabs. You can see I'm gonna lose

01:54.260 --> 01:59.140
Nicely set up, and I'm sorry you didn't lose these that's the good thing. Yes, I am just opening up

01:59.140 --> 02:02.940
Okay, I have a shell script. That's why it seems like is there like if I just type restart

02:03.500 --> 02:05.500
Restart the computer nope

02:05.620 --> 02:09.340
That's not the one wow this guy indexes like a son-of-a-bitch man

02:09.340 --> 02:14.780
It's pulling out it's pulling out notes for I'd have from clients from like years back in my text. Yeah, okay. I'm ready

02:14.780 --> 02:17.980
I'm gonna put it in IRC. Okay, okay, okay?

02:18.900 --> 02:23.740
Don't go don't go don't go don't go don't go don't go don't go don't go don't go don't go don't go don't go

02:23.740 --> 02:25.820
All right, so let's see let's wait for it to come up in IRC

02:26.620 --> 02:29.500
Okay, so I got it. I got a kill to come I gotta run two commands

02:33.580 --> 02:40.260
Okay, no all right so P. So P kill f plasma shell, but that sounds dirty doesn't it all right so here

02:40.260 --> 02:42.180
I'll pull it up on screen so you guys can see what happens

02:42.180 --> 02:47.620
So I'm gonna put that in there P a P kill dash f plasma shell okay ran that and

02:48.140 --> 02:51.420
Then now I got it now so nothing happened, but it's probably fault of two

02:51.420 --> 02:53.820
Okay, alt-f two, and then I have to do what case start

02:55.580 --> 02:57.020
Okay, so

02:57.020 --> 03:04.140
Plasma shell dash dash shut up. Yeah, I know that that's stupid. I love that just means don't spit out all kinds of debug

03:04.140 --> 03:06.140
I love it. I love it. Tell me shut up

03:07.100 --> 03:09.420
Okay, so now I have I

03:09.420 --> 03:13.820
Think I have my desk now look at isn't this weird these plasmas showed up on here that I wasn't using before

03:14.340 --> 03:16.340
hmm, and they're blank

03:16.660 --> 03:18.660
That's weird. Yeah, it is

03:19.060 --> 03:24.460
But I have my dry have my dropbox icon down in the system tray. Hey yeah, there you go, so thank you, sir

03:24.460 --> 03:25.860
No, no problem

03:25.860 --> 03:28.340
I have that in a shell and use your local bin and

03:28.740 --> 03:34.180
Every once in a while plasma will just freak right out so now all those widgets just disappeared when I opened up the drawer

03:34.260 --> 03:37.780
Isn't that weird that's very strong. I'm glad you guys are seeing this. It's not just me

03:37.780 --> 03:41.340
We would never believe you but the CPU monitors back which I thought was gone last time

03:41.340 --> 03:46.060
I logged in I'm gonna stop playing with the plasma isn't dropbox icon. We're hanging out. Yeah, well

03:46.060 --> 03:48.780
Thank you for helping me fix that. It's nice to not have to lose work. I

03:49.380 --> 03:52.860
Like I like being able to recover on the fly. It feels very like Hollywood

03:52.860 --> 03:55.940
Yeah, right, you know like reroute the primary operating system guys

03:55.940 --> 03:56.380
Yeah

03:56.380 --> 04:03.300
You know like I remember I was watching 24 one time and Jack Bauer asked Chloe to rewrite to reroute the primary operating system

04:03.300 --> 04:06.180
There's something like that. I was like, I don't know what that means, but that sounds cool

04:06.180 --> 04:08.220
I don't think they think that is anything

04:09.340 --> 04:12.900
You know the thing I used to love from 24 was when he'd say send it to my screen

04:12.900 --> 04:16.380
Yeah, and they're just like grab hold of a window and throw it across the room. Yeah

04:16.860 --> 04:19.100
Yeah, I want that. I'm still waiting on that

04:19.860 --> 04:21.580
Well, actually there was a package

04:21.580 --> 04:26.180
we used to take the piss out of a friend of mine because he was the Debian maintainer for a package called xmove and

04:26.420 --> 04:31.420
Xmove is a program that can do that and has been around for years and years and years, but I think it's broken now

04:31.420 --> 04:38.200
But yeah, you could do that. You could send up an X program from one screen to another. This is Linux Unplugged episode

04:38.700 --> 04:40.700
137 for March 22nd

04:41.420 --> 04:43.420
2016

04:52.900 --> 04:58.260
Welcome to Linux Unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's celebrating William Shatner's birthday

04:58.260 --> 05:04.460
And has a few surprises up its sleeve like a huge box. My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Do you like that one?

05:04.460 --> 05:07.860
Oh, yeah, I was getting into that one. I was riding the jankies on that one

05:07.860 --> 05:12.780
So coming up on this week's episode huge show big show unbelievable show get out of here. We're gonna have to charge you

05:12.780 --> 05:19.500
It's so big Nvidia claims. They have Wayland working on their current driver, but that might be a little bit presumptuous

05:19.500 --> 05:25.360
We'll tell you why later on in the show major major plans including a big Linux build coming up for Jupiter

05:25.360 --> 05:30.660
Broadcasting right around Linux Fest Northwest. We're gonna tell you about a couple of secret projects that are in the works and big plans

05:30.660 --> 05:32.660
around Linux Fest Northwest and

05:33.460 --> 05:37.580
I'm gonna get psyched up about Noah's switching campaign then later on in the show

05:39.180 --> 05:44.560
Happy birthday, Katie. Well, is it their birthday? What do you call it when they have a release because they do it more frequently than

05:44.560 --> 05:47.120
Every nine months. Yeah, that's true. Happy release a day

05:47.620 --> 05:49.620
That doesn't jazz it up for me enough half

05:49.620 --> 05:53.500
Well, we'll come up with something later on the show because we're talking about plasma desktop 5.6

05:53.500 --> 05:55.500
Been running it for a few days it released today

05:56.380 --> 05:58.380
Gonna do a little bit of follow-up

05:58.380 --> 06:01.260
Some people ask some questions since we talked about a Linux action show

06:01.260 --> 06:04.420
We're gonna do some follow-up on those questions Wes. You've been running right here on this rig

06:04.420 --> 06:08.900
Yeah, you're gonna share your thoughts on it. So we'll discuss that also get the mumble rooms take on

06:08.900 --> 06:11.760
We've got a few Katie users in there and then towards the end of the show

06:12.540 --> 06:17.580
We're gonna do a live throwdown of two open source Google Hangouts killers

06:17.580 --> 06:24.620
They look like they're better quality more control and use WebRTC and our private and safe and peer-to-peer in the background

06:25.140 --> 06:27.540
So pretty cool show and obviously work on Linux

06:27.540 --> 06:29.780
I guess that's kind of a given too and that's just like

06:30.060 --> 06:35.200
The stuff we're gonna do after all of the updates we have to get into from all the projects we follow and stuff

06:35.200 --> 06:37.200
That's broken since the Linux action show

06:37.260 --> 06:42.020
Huge show Wes and get started. I was worried that we were gonna have a bad show today

06:42.020 --> 06:46.580
I I got on the air before you got here. I was like we are screwed and

06:46.580 --> 06:50.980
And I why are you telling everyone our secrets Chris? So I you know, so those of you don't know

06:51.740 --> 06:56.500
There's a Wes had been bringing in great brewskis for us to try during the show and I thought well today won't be the day

06:56.500 --> 06:59.820
He's got to go get a burger Rekai to talk to him into getting a burger for him

06:59.820 --> 07:02.620
And I was like, so he's not gonna have time. I mean really good to the network, right?

07:02.660 --> 07:06.980
Well, there's a burger currency within the network and you can buy favors with people by buying them burgers

07:06.980 --> 07:08.940
So you say you've essentially put a burger in your bank

07:08.940 --> 07:16.540
So that's not a bad move overall strategically for you down the road. I agree, but I was worried. We wouldn't have any beers and

07:17.060 --> 07:18.480
No beers would be a bad show

07:18.480 --> 07:24.260
It's not because we need the alcohols because it's like, you know how certain athletes have certain routines. They have to follow

07:25.420 --> 07:27.440
You know wear the same underwear that kind of thing

07:27.440 --> 07:28.380
Well, of course we're doing that too

07:28.380 --> 07:34.180
but on top of that we like to have one beard or you know with the show and this week Wes brought him something really kind

07:34.180 --> 07:35.740
of eclectic and

07:35.740 --> 07:39.980
It's ecliptic. It's ecliptic brewing and I got the orbiter IPA and you got

07:40.380 --> 07:43.660
Phobos single hop red ale. Damn. Damn

07:43.660 --> 07:44.620
So those would be the brewskis

07:44.620 --> 07:49.200
We're drinking on today's show if you want to drink along with us and maybe just maybe some folks in a mobile room will be

07:49.200 --> 07:51.200
time appropriate greetings mumble room

07:54.780 --> 07:59.660
That's on fire, I love it you guys are fired up ready to go. Okay, so you probably heard the news

07:59.660 --> 08:06.420
It broke on the 21st NVIDIA has published patches for its driver to work with Wayland's Weston, you know

08:06.420 --> 08:08.500
essentially the the reference compositor and

08:09.100 --> 08:14.260
They've made a few tweaks in there and they're pretty happy. They say that this this set of patches

08:15.060 --> 08:19.580
Will allow the Wayland Weston composite run with NVIDIA's new 364 Linux driver series

08:19.820 --> 08:23.780
It's a big deal big deal Wayland support. Ladies and gentlemen, here we are

08:23.780 --> 08:28.860
March 22nd 2016 NVIDIA ships Wayland support

08:29.580 --> 08:31.320
This gets real

08:31.320 --> 08:33.620
Yeah, it felt like a moment for me. However

08:35.180 --> 08:39.020
Not to be a buzzkill but Martin the KWIN maintainer posted on

08:39.580 --> 08:46.420
Google+, that one does not simply run Wayland on Wayland compositor with NVIDIA's new driver. It turns out that

08:47.980 --> 08:51.920
NVIDIA is using EGL streams instead of GBM streams. Okay, what's that mean?

08:51.920 --> 08:55.300
It means that there is code that still is pending in Wayland

08:56.140 --> 08:58.060
To make Wayland work better with EGL

08:58.060 --> 09:03.740
And so really it's coming to Wayland to support EGL and the things that it needs for NVIDIA's driver changes

09:03.780 --> 09:08.460
But NVIDIA's patches essentially accommodate for a Wayland that's just a little bit down the road

09:08.820 --> 09:13.320
Not actually fully shipping just yet from what I'm grokking from this Google plus thread

09:13.320 --> 09:22.220
So while yes NVIDIA gets the headline of shipping Wayland support today. They're shipping support really for Wayland of tomorrow

09:22.220 --> 09:24.020
I suppose that's better than being behind

09:24.020 --> 09:30.580
Totally totally is better than being behind and I think I don't know much but I suspect that's probably a better arrangement from for mobile

09:30.580 --> 09:35.020
Too I suspect there you go. And I mere support might have been in there too. I don't know

09:35.020 --> 09:41.320
I didn't see people got Plymouth working a lot better now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. So in between shows

09:41.320 --> 09:42.720
a

09:42.720 --> 09:46.760
Bit of a controversy and if anybody in the mumbo room has anything they want to say what we're talking about this story

09:46.960 --> 09:50.680
Feel free to speak up. Just tag me in the chat room with mum and say what you want

09:50.680 --> 09:57.400
I'll keep an eye out but I why don't I stop covering these these hardware these hardware server updates from the

09:57.480 --> 10:01.560
From the guys over at valve because you know, you don't really ever know how how reliable it is

10:01.960 --> 10:04.880
you don't really know like what triggers it and

10:05.520 --> 10:08.880
You can't really compare it to without knowing all of the details

10:08.880 --> 10:15.480
But that doesn't stop the press from running stories that Linux gaming is shrinking since the launch of we hate games so much

10:15.480 --> 10:20.880
Yeah, Linux users hate spending money Linux users hate playing video games and Linux gaming is doomed

10:21.560 --> 10:23.980
That was the end of last week this week

10:23.980 --> 10:28.440
However, thanks to Liam over at Linux gaming the article has been reversed over a PC world

10:28.440 --> 10:31.000
In fact, the author of the Linux is dying

10:31.360 --> 10:36.640
Chris Hoffman has now written a piece saying the Linux gaming is actually much healthier than Steam's hardware survey implies

10:36.640 --> 10:41.360
There's actually more Linux gamers than ever before. That's great. That is great

10:41.360 --> 10:48.840
Now here's the kind of the basic things you have to understand when people are talking about that steam hardware survey and the the percentage

10:48.840 --> 10:50.720
of Linux users

10:50.720 --> 10:55.780
Well, first of all, do you know do you know what triggers that hardware survey? I do not I'm not completely clear either

10:56.840 --> 11:03.040
But I do understand that a hardware change does and an OS change can sometimes and I guess from my understanding is it seems to happen

11:03.040 --> 11:08.680
A lot more under Windows than it does under Linux like maybe driver changes or video card changes. I

11:09.320 --> 11:14.840
Have only gotten the steam hardware survey once under Linux. Yeah, I have gotten under Windows a couple of times

11:14.840 --> 11:22.120
And what's crazy about that is I've probably ran Windows three times four times, you know, at least in a steam capacity

11:22.800 --> 11:26.600
In as many years, so the fact that I have actually got a Linux every day

11:26.600 --> 11:29.520
Yeah, and that yeah, and I on some of my machine steam auto starts

11:29.520 --> 11:34.760
So it's weird that I haven't gotten the hardware survey under Linux, but I have gotten under Windows

11:34.760 --> 11:37.180
We don't know anything about the sampling rates or any. Yeah

11:37.760 --> 11:40.780
So here's the obvious caveat though. That's really the elephant in the room

11:41.520 --> 11:43.520
Steam's user base is constantly growing

11:43.620 --> 11:48.640
So while the Linux usage on the steam hardware survey has declined from about 2% in March of 2013

11:49.320 --> 11:50.640
to

11:50.640 --> 11:53.440
0.9 1% in February 2015

11:53.960 --> 11:58.480
That's because it's just a small percentage from a larger overall user base and October 2013

11:58.480 --> 12:05.280
Valve announced there were over 65 million steam users around the world in February of 2015. So that was October 2013

12:06.240 --> 12:11.360
65 million in February 2015 valve announced there were over 125 million active users worldwide

12:12.720 --> 12:17.520
Whoa, they doubled in less than a year. So that's it. Yeah, so it took it

12:17.520 --> 12:21.180
Look, it looks you look at you're looking at percentages here in October 2013. You had

12:21.840 --> 12:26.960
0.98 percent of Linux users. That's about six hundred thirty seven thousand Linux users in February 2015

12:26.960 --> 12:33.580
0.9 1% would be 1.2 million Linux gamers. So we've gone up to 1.2 million Linux gamers

12:34.560 --> 12:36.560
Here's the other things kind of crazy

12:37.000 --> 12:43.480
Valve's steam hardware survey doesn't include steam OS what and doesn't include machines in big picture mode. Oh

12:44.880 --> 12:47.920
So if you've built your own steam OS box and use big picture mode

12:47.920 --> 12:51.620
Or if you like that UI better and you use that under Linux or you're using steam OS

12:51.920 --> 12:53.920
You're not getting counted towards Linux

12:53.920 --> 13:01.160
So that's another reason why the numbers are a little low which is a little funky and valve doesn't really publish much. Go ahead. I

13:02.360 --> 13:04.160
guess people just

13:04.160 --> 13:06.160
That were using Linux

13:06.320 --> 13:13.280
To play steam now use team OS a lot of people did the experiment in like and kids in you want to point something out

13:13.280 --> 13:15.280
Too that actually is kind of common for Linux gamers

13:15.840 --> 13:21.120
yeah, one of the things that I find that I have to do to play the games that I want I have to run it and

13:21.120 --> 13:25.200
Wine and I don't know if steam has a way of counting

13:25.880 --> 13:30.440
Users that are running in wine and saying hey, this is not actually a Windows user. This is a

13:31.160 --> 13:33.360
Linux user running it at wine and

13:33.920 --> 13:38.480
That's a very important detail. Yeah wine users get counted as Windows users

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Val mentioned that before and the Linux

13:41.800 --> 13:47.440
Gaming on Linux community has mentioned that this are the hardware survey seems to pop up more under wine because to steam it looks like

13:47.440 --> 13:51.920
Your OS our hardware is changing sometimes. So yeah, that can be a thing

13:52.560 --> 13:54.520
Any other thoughts on the steam OS stuff?

13:54.520 --> 13:54.720
I mean

13:54.720 --> 13:57.600
I guess I wanted to just my point in bringing this up on the show today

13:57.760 --> 14:02.960
Was to sort of put a little anti spin on the whole Linux gaming is dying. It's actually grown from

14:03.880 --> 14:08.340
700,000 to 1.2 million in the last year. That's a pretty big deal

14:08.340 --> 14:13.440
It's like one of those things kind of like with political polls where yeah a lot of the reporting spins

14:13.440 --> 14:19.080
How you think about it? Go ahead run. Yeah, I only ever use Linux for gaming anyway, and I've never seen

14:20.040 --> 14:27.840
I've never seen a single hardware survey on Linux for my for my usage in six years. Yeah, I've seen it once I think

14:27.840 --> 14:31.280
So yeah, yeah, you're right. It's just different stats and stuff like that

14:31.280 --> 14:34.440
Okay, so this is the story that people brought up right before we started the show

14:34.440 --> 14:36.440
He said you got to talk about this today. You got to talk about

14:37.280 --> 14:38.840
Ubuntu BSD

14:38.840 --> 14:40.840
Unix for human beings

14:40.840 --> 14:47.240
today with they write we have the great pleasure in their opinion of introducing you to a new project that saw the light of

14:47.240 --> 14:52.160
The internet for the first time this past week on March 12 2016 meet Ubuntu BSD

14:52.360 --> 14:57.080
Ubuntu BSD promises to bring the power of FreeBSD kernel to Ubuntu Linux

14:57.960 --> 15:01.900
It is based on FreeBSD 10.1 and Ubuntu 15.10 right now

15:02.800 --> 15:08.600
And of course it's one of its a highlight Cadillac features is it's using the FreeBSD kernel ergo

15:08.600 --> 15:14.000
you get the famous ZFS combined with of course things like

15:14.560 --> 15:16.680
the port system and I

15:17.600 --> 15:19.440
would imagine

15:19.440 --> 15:21.440
Ubuntu's user land

15:21.440 --> 15:26.680
Ubuntu BSD is currently hosted on SourceForge, and it's got an ISO you could download we have linked in the show notes and

15:27.720 --> 15:29.720
the code name for this release is

15:30.920 --> 15:37.800
Escape from systemd but systemd is misspelled you're right it is I mean you wouldn't expect the BSD crowd to know that

15:37.800 --> 15:39.720
It's a little bit of a Linux nuance. I agree

15:39.720 --> 15:40.400
Yeah

15:40.400 --> 15:44.600
You think if you're actually so that as the register points out one of the genesis of this distribution

15:44.840 --> 15:49.120
Was to break away from to be a savior from FreeBSD

15:49.360 --> 15:55.160
I'm sorry from systemd the systemd argument was you know remember how hot that was remember how what a big deal that was yeah

15:55.160 --> 15:58.640
That was one of the reasons they created this was to save the world from systemd

15:58.640 --> 16:01.820
So you think if they're creating a project to save the world from systemd?

16:01.820 --> 16:09.100
You'd likely look into it a little probably know how to write it. It's in that is an interesting observation

16:09.940 --> 16:13.860
But they did it deliberately. Yeah, they clearly don't like this a bit right in the face

16:13.860 --> 16:17.280
That's why they create with a big D. Yeah, they did do it with a big D

16:20.340 --> 16:26.220
2016 do you host a project on SourceForge? That was why I did specifically mention that just to see if anybody would catch that

16:26.220 --> 16:30.200
I probably I'm dying to know what you think of Ubuntu BSD

16:30.200 --> 16:33.280
Is there gonna be a trademark issue here? Do you think?

16:34.600 --> 16:41.240
Sorry, I saw that on the the thread was on the WMBSD mailing list where it was first discussed and that's where it first

16:41.240 --> 16:42.680
came to

16:42.680 --> 16:44.120
my knowledge

16:44.120 --> 16:49.240
And I think I've read all the mails in the thread and some of the the guy

16:49.800 --> 16:54.640
John Bowden who created it was asked when there'd be a trademark issue

16:54.640 --> 16:59.280
And I think definitely avoided that question or didn't see it or whatever for the benefit of the doubt

16:59.280 --> 17:02.120
Um, I don't know. It's a community project

17:03.160 --> 17:05.520
So much like Ubuntu Marte

17:06.160 --> 17:14.560
It probably should be called something like Ubuntu BSD remix or something like that, which would you know fulfill the the naming conventions?

17:14.560 --> 17:16.160
We use now but

17:16.160 --> 17:21.680
No, I don't see there's gonna be a massive deal about it. I uh, I wonder what your thoughts are just on the concept a little bit

17:21.680 --> 17:22.520
I

17:22.520 --> 17:27.360
Think is interesting and I think it actually is a good thing because it highlights how people can take

17:27.360 --> 17:31.400
what we've done in the Ubuntu project and remix it and change it and

17:32.240 --> 17:34.240
Make it to what they want

17:34.240 --> 17:39.080
You know if someone wants if there's a demand for this if there are a bunch of users out there who feel

17:39.560 --> 17:46.640
that there is a need that's serviced by this to have Ubuntu user land and all those the lovely big package repository that we've got

17:46.800 --> 17:51.280
Plus the BSD kernel then knock yourselves out go for it

17:51.280 --> 17:55.040
I personally speaking I think is a great idea and I think it's it's very positive thing

17:55.040 --> 17:57.520
I think what initially turned me off about it was the

17:58.160 --> 18:01.440
Sort of overreaction to system D and I'm not in the trenches

18:01.440 --> 18:05.280
So I don't really know if it's been I have heard from some admins that say yeah

18:05.280 --> 18:08.840
our life is a little more hell now because of system D and I've heard other guys say that

18:09.200 --> 18:13.980
My life is a lot easier now because of system D. So I'm really I don't have a clear picture of it, but it seems like

18:15.400 --> 18:19.120
It seems like a lot of the naysaying the gloom and doom

18:20.440 --> 18:22.200
Really hasn't

18:22.200 --> 18:25.880
Occurred. I mean things really have just kind of gone along as they always have now

18:25.880 --> 18:31.040
I mean, I think we'll still see, you know, this it'll be a big deployment for system D machines. Yeah that space

18:31.040 --> 18:33.040
But yeah, yeah, that's true. That is true

18:33.200 --> 18:37.220
So yeah, go ahead. They're using XFC for this, right? Yes

18:38.080 --> 18:41.360
Why not just use free BSD with XFC using like package ng?

18:43.360 --> 18:46.120
Yeah, you could my question you could yeah why even bother with it

18:46.120 --> 18:51.000
I wonder if this would help with the curve of the like Linux emulations like this would be a better way for some of the stuff

18:51.000 --> 18:53.520
I doubt it was trying to do because you're still using the BSD kernel

18:53.520 --> 18:56.320
So you'd have to be able to compiling things for the first toolchain anyway

18:56.320 --> 18:59.880
So it's not even like it's the same toolchain or something. Yeah, well there is it

18:59.880 --> 19:03.160
There is one reason you do it. It has the word Ubuntu in it

19:03.960 --> 19:09.320
There you go. That's true. Yeah. Hmm. There you go. Hey everybody. It's got a moon doing it. So it must be good

19:10.360 --> 19:15.440
interesting project and I kind of will I think would be interested in checking in on it and say I

19:16.160 --> 19:20.000
Don't know six months and see where they're at. Maybe see if they base it on 1604

19:20.000 --> 19:25.160
It depends on to you like it's always weird when there's something like it's just like a source forge release and some mailing list stuff

19:25.160 --> 19:29.200
It doesn't feel as much like a project that I will want to check up on it

19:29.200 --> 19:33.340
It doesn't have like a actual infrastructure or a page where you get like real communication from the creator

19:33.340 --> 19:36.160
It basically you you project snob

19:37.520 --> 19:41.520
There are lots of little projects out there that use whatever hosting they can use

19:42.560 --> 19:44.560
just because it doesn't have a

19:44.920 --> 19:48.120
You know a fantastic Twitter page and you know

19:48.120 --> 19:55.120
Discourse and it does have a Twitter page actually things, right? Yeah, but I mean like a wonderfully beautiful one. Yeah

19:56.120 --> 20:00.720
I'm not gonna use it in my infrastructure until I know there's more than one package, you know

20:01.600 --> 20:05.400
Of course, you're not gonna yeah in your infrastructure. Yeah, I would agree

20:05.400 --> 20:08.680
I think if it grew a bit and got a community around it'd be worth checking out

20:08.680 --> 20:11.240
I don't think you have to wait till it's like PCB SD size. No

20:12.720 --> 20:15.440
Which is kind of interesting because PCB SD is grown quite a bit

20:15.440 --> 20:22.200
So Ubuntu BSD at Ubuntu BSD and it's followed by poppy. So look at that. Whoa. Yeah. Yeah

20:23.240 --> 20:28.920
I was following it when I only had 11 followers. Wow. Look at you now now I'm following it when it has

20:29.440 --> 20:33.720
338 followers, so yeah, I like it. So I say now yeah

20:37.320 --> 20:40.340
Kitson I wanted to give you the final word on it before we move on

20:40.340 --> 20:46.860
Yeah, they said I believe was William that said oh, it's Ubuntu and that's why they're doing it

20:46.860 --> 20:48.780
And that's why somebody would use it

20:48.780 --> 20:55.620
I also think that the familiarity with the base OS would also be a big push as well because it is Ubuntu

20:55.620 --> 21:00.020
Not necessarily the name but a lot of people know how to admin Ubuntu

21:00.180 --> 21:06.960
That would like to use some of those lower level features in BSD. Yeah, and that's just a good way of you know

21:06.960 --> 21:13.420
Getting it out there. It's not going to be because you don't have system D

21:13.420 --> 21:16.680
Which Ubuntu and you definitely don't have upstart which Ubuntu would have had in the past

21:16.900 --> 21:23.300
Yeah, and and fast instead of a traditional file system on Linux. Yeah, you're not gonna there's a lot of things

21:23.300 --> 21:27.640
You don't get there's a lot of things. You're not gonna get you're not gonna get Docker or containers. You'll get jails, which is fine

21:28.260 --> 21:33.900
It does feel like a kind of hybrid bastard child of two projects or like three or four projects really doesn't it?

21:33.900 --> 21:40.220
Yeah, and I I'm I wonder too what happens when when FreeBSD finally gets around to developing their system D

21:40.220 --> 21:44.760
You know, it's gonna happen and then where are all those guys gonna go where everybody needs a refuge from that

21:44.760 --> 21:48.500
Where are they gonna go? Where are they gonna go? Gentoo? Slackware? Lumos?

21:50.140 --> 21:53.420
No, this is just the dev one version of BSD

21:54.120 --> 21:57.820
Yeah, you're right. You're right. I know I know I just tease a little bit. Yeah, I tease

21:58.500 --> 22:03.060
Interesting discussion though and a project probably worth some of you keeping your eyes on

22:03.060 --> 22:05.780
So if you end up trying out Ubuntu BSD

22:05.780 --> 22:11.580
I welcome you to let us know let us let us know comment in the in the reddit thread or even better

22:11.580 --> 22:13.300
You could join us

22:13.300 --> 22:16.460
In the mobile room in a future edition of the unplugged show. Hmm

22:17.420 --> 22:19.700
Ubuntu BSD, you know West

22:20.420 --> 22:26.420
My problem is I got a lot going on these next few weeks Linux fest Northwest is getting crazy

22:26.820 --> 22:31.780
Angela and I have like a little lie, you know meeting to this morning right after a tech talk and we were just going down

22:31.780 --> 22:34.540
The list constantly. Okay, we gotta think about this. We got to take care of this. We gotta work on this

22:34.540 --> 22:35.500
We got to make sure this is ready

22:35.500 --> 22:43.700
it is nuts and part of it is because like we have very few opportunities where so many of the crew are in one spot right and

22:44.900 --> 22:48.340
Because we all are fairly technically savvy. You can really pull off some cool projects

22:48.340 --> 22:52.540
so like there's not only is there like the the Linux fest stuff and the

22:53.020 --> 22:57.420
organization of getting everybody in here and getting this place ready to like bring a bunch of people in and

22:57.420 --> 23:03.420
then figuring out like a whole bunch of accommodations for Linux fest Northwest and the booth and the technology to make that all happen and

23:03.540 --> 23:06.180
The scheduling and coordinating needs to happen with the Linux fest people

23:06.180 --> 23:07.220
But on top of all of that

23:07.220 --> 23:14.540
We're gonna pull off a really cool project something that will change JB and bring way more Linux into this area right here

23:14.540 --> 23:21.500
You're looking at over there where there's that wire cast machine. It's gross. I just don't look at it West super excited

23:21.500 --> 23:27.380
I might be biting off more than I can chew and I I pain to tell you how many Bitcoin it has cost me

23:27.380 --> 23:31.900
But first before we get into this new project the new secret project. I want to tell you about ting

23:32.300 --> 23:39.120
Yes, ting ting is my mobile service provider and it's mobile that makes sense minutes messages megabytes and six dollars a month for the line

23:39.120 --> 23:44.180
That's all you pay. No secret crazy plans. No dumb rollover gimmicks

23:44.180 --> 23:49.340
It's just you pay for what you use for minutes messages and megabytes and a flat six dollars for the line

23:49.340 --> 23:53.060
They have fanatical customer service. They have GSM and CDMA networks

23:53.940 --> 23:59.620
So you can get probably at least a high probability that your device will be compatible with ting

23:59.620 --> 24:04.380
Which means you'll get a $25 service credit average ting monthly line is $24

24:04.380 --> 24:09.100
So your first month will be more than paid for if you're in a contract right now. They have early termination reliefs. Oh

24:09.580 --> 24:14.420
Guess what? No contracts and no early termination. Hey, that's right phones are unlocked

24:14.420 --> 24:19.140
You own them outright West you own that phone outright and they have the best control panel in the business

24:19.140 --> 24:24.820
As we get ready to go pick up ham radio for Linux fest Northwest. I'll be bringing my ting hotspot

24:24.820 --> 24:26.820
I just turn it off when I'm not on the road

24:26.900 --> 24:32.460
Doesn't cost me a dollar. It's great turn it on and I just for that road trip. I use that hotspot

24:32.460 --> 24:33.660
Okay, so what's it gonna cost me?

24:33.660 --> 24:35.580
Cuz you know just be paying from I'm paying for my usage

24:35.580 --> 24:40.740
So I go from not paying anything to like 35 45 bucks for one month

24:41.860 --> 24:44.620
Average is out pretty nicely. Yeah, it does. Yeah, I mean, you know

24:44.620 --> 24:47.980
I do that every couple of months it works so smooth and their control panel lets me turn it on and off

24:47.980 --> 24:52.540
I invite you to go check it out. They also have a great blog, but first go to Linux dot ting comm

24:52.860 --> 24:54.660
They have our app picks up on their blog

24:54.660 --> 24:59.760
They have great great 4k online hints if you have a if you have a 4k television

24:59.760 --> 25:03.260
I want to do online streaming your cord cutter and want to watch 4k. They got a great blog post on that

25:03.300 --> 25:10.340
They have information on fiber internet. I mean, it's a great company backed by two cows who've been around for a long time

25:11.220 --> 25:17.360
Linux dot ting comm go there support this show visiting that visiting that page letting them know you heard about it here

25:17.360 --> 25:23.960
Supports the show try out their savings calculator. See if it's worth your money read their blog get to know more about the company

25:24.440 --> 25:30.640
See why I like them so much Linux dot ting comm and a big thank you to ting for sponsoring the Linux unplugged program

25:30.640 --> 25:32.980
We love you guys. You think I'm chatty. I

25:33.640 --> 25:41.540
Think so. Yeah, Jonathan riddle said I was chatty. That's not necessarily a bad thing though. No, no, I suppose not but I mean you are

25:41.540 --> 25:47.320
A Linux I do talk personality. Yeah, kind of have to be I guess that's a lot quieter

25:47.320 --> 25:51.020
You sure you're not trying to make me feel better cuz chatty feels like a bad description

25:51.680 --> 25:53.080
Maybe I don't get well

25:53.080 --> 25:57.360
I mean if you're like the noisy person in the office bothering everyone while they're trying to get work done

25:57.360 --> 26:01.260
But this is your office. Yeah, you know, yeah wimpy. Do you think I'm chatty wimpy?

26:03.200 --> 26:10.080
He's not answer he's left but he authorized me to say oh, do you think I'm chatty? Yeah. Okay, so it define chatty for me

26:10.080 --> 26:12.080
I

26:12.520 --> 26:16.720
Doesn't like there being dead air. Oh true. It's probably a fair. Yeah

26:17.760 --> 26:19.160
Approximation. Yeah, if there's ever dead air

26:19.160 --> 26:25.440
It's intentional dead air because that feels like a left feels like an American broadcasting golden rule though. You don't ever let there be dead air

26:26.840 --> 26:32.560
Informal and lively. Yeah, that sounds nice. Yeah. Yeah, would you look it up? Well naturally you did

26:34.320 --> 26:38.160
Yeah, I I guess I'll take that accusation, you know

26:38.160 --> 26:43.720
every now and then though I go for the opposite effect and I let I let there be a pregnant pause just for

26:45.440 --> 26:51.920
Effect so sometimes it's worth it. All right. Yeah, fine. Thank you. All right. I will so let's chat. Let's be chatty

26:51.920 --> 26:56.960
Let's chat about Linux fest Northwest. So you guys know about I've talked about it a bunch and I won't I won't bore you

26:56.960 --> 27:02.280
With the details. It's April 23rd and 24th. So it's next month. It's in Bellingham, which is a gorgeous

27:02.280 --> 27:04.000
How long was the last time you went to Bellingham?

27:04.000 --> 27:08.360
Mmm, probably like six months ago. Oh, that's actually pretty recently for how far it is from you

27:09.160 --> 27:11.160
It really is beautiful though. Good

27:11.280 --> 27:14.080
Super gorgeous super gorgeous hippie town

27:14.640 --> 27:17.920
You got a while there might be some clouds of weed smoke. You gotta watch out for that

27:17.920 --> 27:21.020
And I walk through one on your way to a restaurant. Yeah, that's true. So

27:21.640 --> 27:25.680
I'm really looking forward to this and one of the things that we kind of did this year

27:25.880 --> 27:28.720
it came out of our visit to system 76 is

27:28.720 --> 27:33.360
Emma and Noah are thrown down and I first I hem and hawt about this and then I decided

27:34.360 --> 27:38.000
Maybe we should really go crazy with this because like we're just switch this

27:38.000 --> 27:44.480
I mean the end goal is to switch people to Linux right? So why not just go all out and have some fun with this? And

27:46.240 --> 27:50.640
I don't have all like it all worked out yet cuz it's no way, you know, he's too busy

27:50.640 --> 27:53.760
Yep, I should have brought him in for the show so I could put him in on the spot

27:53.760 --> 27:56.920
But I feel like it's not calling him on here. Yeah. Oh, yeah

27:56.920 --> 28:00.280
You should start calling him on here. Yeah. Oh, you call him. That'd be so funny

28:01.080 --> 28:01.760
I

28:01.760 --> 28:06.360
Feel like we got to get some of this stuff squared away and I want to go all-in on on making this work

28:06.360 --> 28:13.200
So the goal here is handed to her Emma and Noah Emma from system 76 and Noah are gonna try to convert as many people to

28:13.200 --> 28:18.200
Linux and and get them switched over and happy with Linux now when they both have different approaches

28:18.720 --> 28:25.280
Emma's gonna be giving away swag to people who switch we're gonna bring stickers and swag and Noah's gonna have SSDs. Whoa

28:25.280 --> 28:31.120
Yeah, now here's what I learned and I'm not even joking with you. This is this is legit honest to God

28:31.120 --> 28:36.760
I learned this Emma is doing a frickin dry run in Denver before she comes out. No way

28:36.760 --> 28:39.400
She's doing like a practice run to get herself ready

28:39.540 --> 28:44.800
So that way she's got like all the right moves and stuff Noah's life is basically a practice run though. So that's true

28:44.840 --> 28:46.840
That's a good point, but I'm telling you

28:47.240 --> 28:50.840
You better be prepared. Yeah, and so you and I quick a brainstorm

28:50.840 --> 28:55.080
I'm also I've told him he should contact the local Linux users group up there

28:55.080 --> 29:02.280
And other things like that and I'm hoping that maybe the listener Jed and Angela can maybe work because Jed's from up there

29:02.280 --> 29:08.040
I'm gonna call some like local IT guys people unhappy with their computers bring their clients around. That's really good

29:08.040 --> 29:13.080
That's really good or put that in slack. That's really good. But but you know what put a pin on that we need that one

29:13.080 --> 29:18.720
That's good. Yeah, get the local IT or a USB drive that just wipes their whole computer and puts Linux on that's the other

29:19.600 --> 29:24.360
I want to take it up a notch and we we have we're bringing a whole where here's my thoughts

29:24.360 --> 29:28.880
We're bringing the crew in right? So we're gonna give jobs to the crew during this time. We're gonna go all in

29:28.880 --> 29:32.760
It's gonna be a network-wide effort. We're gonna have people go out in the audience and like grab people

29:32.760 --> 29:36.520
I don't know where we're ever at restaurants library bar at Linux fest

29:36.520 --> 29:41.960
We're gonna have people go out into the crowd and like pre-screen and get likely candidates and and have them funnel them into Noah

29:42.080 --> 29:46.360
So that he can sit there and rapid convert people. So we're gonna have the crew do preliminary work

29:46.360 --> 29:50.360
I don't think she's gonna be doing I probably shouldn't be telecasting too much. I got other plans. He's not listening

29:50.360 --> 29:56.200
Well, she she can't compete with we're gonna bring the army and the weight of the broadcasting network down on this thing

29:56.200 --> 30:00.400
And there is a crew. There is a critical component that we are launching today

30:01.040 --> 30:04.520
To help us with this effort and to help you with this effort

30:05.240 --> 30:10.600
Teespring.com slash. Here's the thing. It is a brand new t-shirt hoodie and long-sleeve shirt

30:10.600 --> 30:14.920
We're hoping to raise some funds for our efforts over at Linux fest and we're doing it now

30:15.280 --> 30:17.280
So that way you'd actually have in time

30:17.280 --> 30:21.680
To wear at Linux fest if you want to meet up with us and become part of our crew or just get it for yourself

30:22.040 --> 30:26.200
Here it is. Look at this beauty West it reads on the front

30:27.000 --> 30:33.200
By popular demand. It has a nice classy last breast logo over the wear that anywhere. Yeah on the front

30:33.200 --> 30:37.520
It's nice and classy and we have multiple colors. We also have the hoodie and

30:38.200 --> 30:42.960
We have the long-sleeve at teespring.com slash. Here's the thing and then on the back

30:42.960 --> 30:51.020
It says here's the thing dot-dot-dot and then our last tux we're holding the Jupiter broadcasting rocket

30:51.520 --> 30:53.020
Here's the thing

30:53.020 --> 30:55.020
Do you have a minute to talk about?

30:55.800 --> 30:57.380
Linux that's great

30:57.380 --> 31:00.160
This is your opening line to get people to convert to Linux right here

31:00.160 --> 31:01.920
And if you if you want to grab it now

31:01.920 --> 31:05.940
We're it's gonna go for 13 more days 5 hours 17 minutes

31:05.940 --> 31:12.080
And it should ship in time for Linux fest Northwest or to have on your own and the funds for this will go towards

31:12.080 --> 31:15.700
Supporting bringing people out here getting I mean just beginning

31:15.700 --> 31:19.800
I mean, this is a massively expensive thing that we're doing but we got we can't run too far into the red

31:19.800 --> 31:22.000
So we got to start something here. Plus this is an awesome shirt

31:22.000 --> 31:26.680
We've had people been asking to have the logo on the front smaller because otherwise it's like this monster

31:26.680 --> 31:28.680
It's as mastered like huge

31:28.880 --> 31:33.020
Advertisement billboard on your belly. And so now we've got a logo over the breast pocket area

31:33.020 --> 31:35.820
There's no breast pocket but in that general area and on the back

31:37.120 --> 31:40.360
Big tux, isn't that awesome? And if you didn't want to show that break wear a jacket

31:40.360 --> 31:45.320
But so teespring.com slash here's the thing three more needed to be ordered for it to ship

31:45.960 --> 31:47.960
13 days total

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
This is part one. This is phase one

31:50.480 --> 31:55.820
We'll be giving these out and will be probably there may be a special edition at Linux fest, too

31:55.880 --> 32:01.800
If you have one you may be qualified for a special edition. We'll see I've talked to Angie about that teespring.com slash

32:01.800 --> 32:08.640
Here's the thing. So that's phase one, right? That's phase one phase two is we got to change up a little software

32:08.640 --> 32:11.780
We got to make a little front-end back-end change to get ready for this

32:12.240 --> 32:16.640
Last time I went on the road trip. I used something called silver cloud to track my trip

32:16.640 --> 32:21.500
So you could go to broadcast no columns last rover and watch where I'm going Chris creep on me

32:22.240 --> 32:27.000
That was a proprietary piece of hardware and I want to switch over to using something open source

32:27.000 --> 32:32.360
So, you know something run like on a mobile device and Poby I know didn't you play with track car Poby?

32:33.280 --> 32:36.620
No, it wasn't me. I wrote my own. Oh, you did write your own now

32:36.620 --> 32:38.620
Oh because it was running on Ubuntu, huh?

32:39.720 --> 32:42.440
Yeah, it would have run on any phone, but I happen to write a problem, too

32:42.440 --> 32:44.720
And so I'm looking at track car

32:44.720 --> 32:49.160
I don't know. Did now did you look at track car before you wrote your own tracking or did you just say?

32:49.160 --> 32:53.040
Yeah, this is easy enough. I just looked at yours and thought that was cool. I should read

32:54.560 --> 32:58.380
Yeah, and I of course I just went the easy button I wanted a dedicated piece of hardware

32:58.880 --> 33:01.560
But now now I'm thinking okay, I could probably make it work on the phone

33:01.560 --> 33:07.160
So there's two projects and I'd like to the audience if anybody in the audience has tried this track car trac car

33:07.160 --> 33:11.760
It is an open source GPS tracking system for various different types of devices

33:11.760 --> 33:16.760
It could work on hardware or in my case on mobile and then it reports back to your own server

33:17.400 --> 33:20.400
That you could be running anywhere, right? You could be running droplet or whatever

33:21.080 --> 33:24.720
And then it lets you embed like a Google Map of your position

33:24.720 --> 33:29.320
So that's track car and then Wes you found own tracks own

33:29.320 --> 33:33.440
Tracks is a different project that allows you to keep track of your own location

33:33.440 --> 33:38.840
And you can have a you could share it with just certain people or I could publicly I could publicly publish it

33:38.840 --> 33:42.000
it's also open source and uses open protocols and

33:43.720 --> 33:45.720
Looks to be a little more mobile focused

33:45.720 --> 33:48.240
Yeah, and it also is more like social networking focus

33:48.240 --> 33:50.720
Like if you're looking at the app like you can see your friends on the map, right?

33:50.720 --> 33:55.600
So I'm feeling like track car might be the better likes you want to meet up with all your JB friends

33:55.600 --> 33:57.600
Well, that would be cool too, but I don't need to track their location

33:57.600 --> 34:00.520
Yeah, you know they can track mine, but I don't need to track theirs

34:00.520 --> 34:03.160
I kind of want to set up a track server on a digital ocean droplet

34:03.160 --> 34:08.360
I hate asking this but if anybody out there is has experience doing this and wants to save me time and

34:08.640 --> 34:14.220
Then just transfer me the droplet. I would totally love that because I got a lot coming up for Linux fest. So track car

34:15.160 --> 34:20.880
Is I think how I'll do my live rover tracking so I don't have to pay for that proprietary solution

34:20.880 --> 34:27.160
You have like ten phones in your pocket. Yeah. Well, yeah, and I'm trying to get as much Linux and open-source into Lady Jupiter as possible

34:27.160 --> 34:31.520
So every part where I have a proprietary hardware solution or software. I'm trying to put something that's awesome

34:31.520 --> 34:35.440
So track car org if anybody knows how to set that up and wants to set me up one, that'd be awesome

34:35.440 --> 34:39.680
Otherwise, I'll try to get to it before they go pick up ham. So one of the things we're doing is

34:40.520 --> 34:42.400
the weekend before

34:42.400 --> 34:44.200
Linux fest Northwest

34:44.200 --> 34:47.680
Where Noah if all goes as planned should be in town

34:48.800 --> 34:52.760
Arriving Saturday night to do Linux action show Sunday in studio

34:52.760 --> 34:57.160
Then we'll complete Linux action show in studio Sunday. We may do it early

34:58.440 --> 35:01.320
Hit the road in Lady Jupiter head over to Idaho

35:02.120 --> 35:03.960
Meet up with ham. Yeah

35:03.960 --> 35:05.960
Then potentially on the way back

35:05.960 --> 35:12.040
There are rumors afoot that we may meet up with a few other JB audience members and do like a caravan back

35:12.440 --> 35:16.360
From from Idaho. That sounds awesome. Yeah, it really does sound awesome

35:16.360 --> 35:20.360
So the track car would be tracking all of that. So we're getting all of that set up right now

35:20.360 --> 35:24.520
It should be yeah, right. Lady Jupiter is the rover. So like you have

35:25.080 --> 35:29.800
Function the rover and you have the name of current rover, which is Lady Jupiter. Okay

35:30.840 --> 35:32.840
part of our secret

35:33.800 --> 35:35.800
Linux fest Northwest plans

35:36.360 --> 35:40.840
Are contained in this box West. Did you see this box when you walked in? No, I missed it. It's very secretive

35:40.840 --> 35:46.280
You missed this box. It's right over there. I was delivering hamburgers and beers and beer. That's true. All right

35:46.280 --> 35:48.280
I'll give you credit there. Oh, that's true

35:48.280 --> 35:50.280
I uh

35:50.280 --> 35:56.760
I have had a heck of a time with video and sometimes when power goes out we lose episodes because the best days. Mm-hmm

35:57.240 --> 35:59.560
when power goes out, uh, so we

36:00.120 --> 36:01.080
Oh boy

36:01.080 --> 36:05.160
I know what everybody I'm you know what i'm stopping myself because i'm realizing all of the emails i'm going to get

36:05.160 --> 36:07.160
Why don't you use a ups? Why don't you have?

36:07.560 --> 36:11.800
I don't have a ups on our main broadcasting machine because in the past has been introducing buzz to our audio

36:12.040 --> 36:15.800
So I removed a ups from our main broadcasting machine, which means when the power goes out

36:15.800 --> 36:19.560
You lose the recording because the way the video files are written to hard disks

36:20.120 --> 36:21.320
they

36:21.320 --> 36:26.520
They close out the atom file at the end of the video file and if you don't write that atom file properly

36:26.680 --> 36:32.280
The rest of the video is unusable. There are some recovery tools, but they suck and pretty much only work for mp4s not

36:32.760 --> 36:34.760
lossless video

36:35.080 --> 36:40.600
And this has sucked so bad because we we've lost hours of content before and um

36:40.920 --> 36:44.040
Because it can get stormy here in the pacific northwest. That's like a thing and

36:44.040 --> 36:46.040
so what we're going to do

36:46.360 --> 36:48.360
is uh

36:48.360 --> 36:52.520
Build a new solution build a new solution based on linux and obs

36:53.080 --> 36:54.040
obs

36:54.040 --> 36:55.400
and uh

36:55.400 --> 36:59.320
So last week, I think it might have been after linux unplugged. I can't remember

36:59.880 --> 37:06.840
You know, I've I uh, i've always sort of as a hobby followed bitcoin for a while. I did plan b as a podcast and um,

37:07.160 --> 37:09.160
i've always been pretty good at

37:09.160 --> 37:14.520
i've always been pretty good at watching when bitcoin bitcoin rises and when bitcoin falls, what is it right now?

37:15.320 --> 37:19.240
Let's check it out. Yeah, will you check out? What is the bitcoin price right now if I uh,

37:20.360 --> 37:26.040
Too bad you uh, let's see. So we're 19 29 4 16 at coinbase right now. And uh, what'd you see?

37:26.200 --> 37:30.040
Well, this is bitcoin average 4 19 4 19. Yeah, that's pretty good

37:30.040 --> 37:35.000
So the low has been like around 407 today or 4010 or 410. I mean and the high has been 4 17

37:35.000 --> 37:39.320
So it got around I think it was up at 4 22 bitcoin was and I said to rikai

37:39.640 --> 37:44.520
I said because rikai, you know rikai for say is pretty current on on hardware and I said to him

37:44.760 --> 37:45.800
uh

37:45.800 --> 37:50.120
Could you build me a list of a really powerful machine? I gave him all the things I wanted to do

37:50.680 --> 37:52.680
uh and

37:53.400 --> 37:58.200
The one caveat is all these things have to be shipped directly by newegg because if i'm going to pay in bitcoin

37:58.440 --> 38:02.440
And bitcoin is only accepted by newegg when you ship directly from newegg. That's the little catch

38:02.440 --> 38:03.800
Ah

38:03.800 --> 38:08.600
If it's any of their third-party, uh marketer market providers, they don't accept bitcoin

38:09.800 --> 38:15.160
And I wanted to buy this in bitcoin because uh, otherwise i'm i'm poor and uh all your money's in the coin

38:15.720 --> 38:23.560
Well, no, but that's where any learning a bit about your portfolio any money I can spend is in bitcoin. Uh, and uh,

38:24.280 --> 38:27.080
So, uh, I look at as a personal investment in the business a little bit

38:27.080 --> 38:30.280
So what I decided to do was uh, I spent quite a bit of bitcoin actually

38:30.280 --> 38:34.840
Um because I figured 425 was probably going to be the high point for a while. So spend while it's high, right?

38:34.920 --> 38:36.440
maybe i'm wrong, but

38:36.440 --> 38:41.800
Uh, my philosophy with bitcoin is is if you see it going up and down if you get it somewhere in the mid average up

38:42.600 --> 38:44.600
Even if it goes up a little bit you did pretty good

38:44.920 --> 38:48.360
And so, uh, I ordered I don't remember all of the details now

38:48.440 --> 38:50.440
I probably should have pulled this up before the show

38:50.600 --> 38:55.000
But uh a six core processor a new motherboard, uh quite a bit of ram

38:55.560 --> 38:59.800
Uh about 32 gigs worth of ram excellent, um ssd m sata m dot

38:59.800 --> 39:04.840
Or 2.5 drives wherever the ones that go into the motherboard instead of uh, like, you know, the regular 2.5 inch

39:05.720 --> 39:07.000
um

39:07.000 --> 39:10.300
nvidia 960 I think gtx graphics

39:11.800 --> 39:13.400
Lots of goodies

39:13.400 --> 39:15.720
And the other thing I did is I bought two of everything

39:16.600 --> 39:22.280
So what we'll do now is we will build two of these machines. That's great identical builds identical software configs

39:22.360 --> 39:25.240
Both installed ready to be obs broadcast machines

39:26.440 --> 39:28.440
And one will be over there

39:28.440 --> 39:33.480
Doing all of our endpoint broadcasting and recording a real-time backup of the live stream

39:34.600 --> 39:38.840
And then the second build will be sitting under this table the the broadcast the desk here

39:40.280 --> 39:42.600
And if anything ever happens to the main broadcast machine

39:42.920 --> 39:47.320
I just unplug the one under the table here and plug in over there and I can start broadcasting again

39:47.320 --> 39:49.320
I have a I have a one-to-one backup

39:49.480 --> 39:51.160
Uh, and that also means down the road

39:51.160 --> 39:53.960
Like if we want to experiment with new crazy versions of obs or linux

39:54.120 --> 39:57.000
We could switch over to the backup one run off that for a couple of days

39:57.000 --> 39:59.720
Do our upgrades and experimentations on the new machine?

40:00.520 --> 40:02.360
Maybe like a new patch or something like that

40:02.360 --> 40:05.400
And if you ever need to you just fail back to the exactly one you haven't touched

40:05.560 --> 40:10.600
It's going to be so so so so nice and it's going to get rid of so many problems of the mac pro caused

40:11.080 --> 40:14.280
Uh, I am majorly looking forward to it. So that's one of the projects

40:14.280 --> 40:17.960
So all of like all of like the little components showed up today in that box

40:18.040 --> 40:21.240
What's still missing is I haven't picked a case. I'd like to have identical nice cases. Yeah

40:21.960 --> 40:23.960
But I don't want to spend too much on that

40:23.960 --> 40:28.040
and storage because the one thing is is the hardest thing is I don't know if I can really

40:28.440 --> 40:32.920
I don't know if I can buy two sets of storage storage for this thing because the thing needs like two three terabytes

40:33.560 --> 40:34.840
really fast

40:34.840 --> 40:36.840
Maybe even more like five terabytes

40:36.920 --> 40:41.080
Really fast and maybe even more than that if possible and I don't really want to buy two sets of those

40:41.320 --> 40:43.640
So I haven't bought that yet. I haven't gotten a case yet

40:43.640 --> 40:45.640
There's still a lot I have to buy and it's like

40:46.040 --> 40:48.120
I only I only want to spend so much of my personal money

40:48.920 --> 40:50.600
But the network can't really afford to do it right now

40:50.600 --> 40:53.320
but this I think is going to be such a huge upgrade for us because

40:53.320 --> 40:54.680
on the back end

40:54.680 --> 40:58.440
We're going to rework a ton of stuff the way a ton of stuff works the way we broadcast

40:58.760 --> 41:01.960
We should be it should open us up to a bunch of more streams and then down the road

41:02.440 --> 41:04.440
Hopefully take to our capabilities even further

41:04.920 --> 41:09.400
So it's going to be a nice rig with with six physical cores and then hyper-threading on top of that

41:09.400 --> 41:12.120
We should be able to stream to multiple places do multiple encodings

41:13.080 --> 41:16.520
Live backups all that kind of stuff and then on top of all of that

41:16.520 --> 41:21.160
We should be able to record the build of these things and the configuration of these things and get some content out of it, too

41:21.160 --> 41:24.680
So i'm i'm i'm thinking it's going to be a big huge upgrade for us

41:24.840 --> 41:29.720
And it's going to reduce a bunch of dependency on on on wirecast, which i'm really excited about

41:30.680 --> 41:33.480
So yeah, that's a big call so obs can do it

41:34.280 --> 41:35.000
Well, we'll see

41:35.000 --> 41:36.840
I don't know if it'll handle all the camera switching

41:36.840 --> 41:44.120
But it's definitely going to handle all of the streaming all of the master recording and switching of uh live stream to recorded streams

41:44.680 --> 41:48.200
Which even if I just take all of that off of wirecast

41:48.200 --> 41:54.600
That itself will make wirecast more stable and reliable and then we can just because a part of the problem is i'd have to

41:54.600 --> 41:56.200
Buy all new capture cards, too

41:56.200 --> 42:00.200
Possibly we will go we what we what I plan to do is take it as far as we can take it

42:00.200 --> 42:05.320
We may try taking the capture cards out of that machine and putting them in the new machine and seeing how far we can

42:05.320 --> 42:07.320
Take it and if we can go all the way

42:07.560 --> 42:11.240
We would go all the way but there's a lot of little things like green screening and compositing that

42:11.720 --> 42:14.680
Uh, we would need to be able to do like dynamic stuff that

42:15.400 --> 42:17.160
Possible but yeah. Yeah

42:17.160 --> 42:20.920
Really excited about that and so for for us linux fest isn't just about the fest

42:21.480 --> 42:23.480
And this emma noah competition

42:23.960 --> 42:25.560
But there's also some really cool projects

42:25.560 --> 42:30.440
We're going to be working on that are going to have big long-term improvements for the network down some network technical debt here

42:31.960 --> 42:34.360
So i'm pretty excited so it all is so at least not all of it

42:34.360 --> 42:36.120
I think but a huge chunk of it

42:36.120 --> 42:39.560
It's funny because it's so much money that I spend and then I see it in one box like that

42:39.560 --> 42:43.240
I'm, like I was expecting more boxes makes you feel just poor

42:43.240 --> 42:47.240
but then again like amazon ships boxes within boxes within boxes, so I I guess I

42:47.800 --> 42:51.240
I guess I can't complain too much and I don't know. I don't know. We'll see where it goes

42:51.320 --> 42:58.120
Noah's already scheming about the setup. So I think it should be really fun. I know obs can do green screening, uh, but uh,

42:59.240 --> 43:00.680
I'm particular

43:00.680 --> 43:06.520
Yeah, oh that's super exciting. Thanks. Yeah, I I'm I it's been it's been a long time since i've had a really new

43:06.680 --> 43:09.880
Uh computer to build right except for with the exception of these lebrons and the apollo

43:09.880 --> 43:11.880
Which has been boom all of a sudden hit at the same time

43:11.880 --> 43:16.760
But uh, you know, my main machine upstairs is like a original first generation i7. Oh wow

43:16.920 --> 43:21.560
Uh, that is a that that broadcast machine. There's a 2012 model, right? So that's an old rig

43:22.120 --> 43:27.100
So all these machines are getting several generations old so to get two of the identical current generation

43:27.640 --> 43:32.440
Machines and build them and the nice thing is when that machine's over under the table acting is just like a backup

43:33.240 --> 43:34.760
I'll use it as like all my visuals

43:34.760 --> 43:37.960
It'll have a nice video card so I can I can show off some nice new steam games

43:37.960 --> 43:42.040
And do you know like 60 frames per second gaming stuff like that, which will be really nice

43:43.320 --> 43:48.680
Get captured you won't have any hardware excuses when your program that you're testing out on air brakes live. Yeah, I am

43:48.840 --> 43:52.840
Uh, I it is it is it's funny, you know, because it's it's one point. It's a little crazy

43:52.840 --> 43:57.400
It's a little scary because i'm I we're we're building up a whole bunch of stuff and i've just spent a whole bunch of money

43:57.560 --> 43:58.360
on it

43:58.360 --> 43:59.720
Uh at the south at the other time though

43:59.720 --> 44:05.400
I can't wait to have it all sort of done and just have that stage that i've been waiting on for so many years done

44:05.400 --> 44:10.360
It feels like i'll be checking off a box that has been years in the making i'm really excited about that

44:10.600 --> 44:13.880
Uh, and just rekindle today we're talking about some of the crazy things we're going to be able to do now

44:14.120 --> 44:18.280
Um, they're going to make other things that will make some of like the live stream experience smoother

44:18.280 --> 44:21.000
we won't have to like bring the stream down between shows and

44:21.480 --> 44:25.480
Um, but it'll also make it so that way we don't lose content for the released versions, too

44:25.480 --> 44:30.200
So it's like it's going to improve the live streams and the recorded shows and it's going to be used and it's going to be

44:30.200 --> 44:31.960
done using linux

44:31.960 --> 44:33.800
That is awesome. Mm-hmm

44:33.800 --> 44:36.600
I am really pretty super excited really coming along the way. Yeah, well, we'll see

44:36.840 --> 44:39.240
We'll see now the next but the thing is to focus on right now

44:39.560 --> 44:42.920
We got to get as many people switched to linux as possible. We got to come up with a game plan

44:42.920 --> 44:44.920
So if you are in the bellingham area

44:45.160 --> 44:47.160
Which has got to be just a few of you

44:47.320 --> 44:51.720
And you could help us come up with a solid winning game plan where we could take noah and our crew

44:52.360 --> 44:56.040
And interrupt people and not get them upset and convince them to try linux

44:56.200 --> 45:00.360
And the other thing that was thinking is if you're going to linux fest northwest bring a friend who hasn't yet switched

45:00.360 --> 45:05.560
Yeah, because they're going to get an ssd they're going to get swag and they're going to get switched to linux

45:06.040 --> 45:12.040
So that's pretty cool and you can help our effort teespring.com slash. Here's the thing. That's a pretty cool shirt, too

45:12.120 --> 45:16.840
I I want the long sleeve one myself. We're selling the t-shirt pretty much at cost

45:17.320 --> 45:21.400
Uh with a slight markup just a real small one to hopefully raise a little bit of funds

45:21.880 --> 45:27.720
Uh, I mean someone's got to buy those ssds shipping april 4th, hopefully or uh, not shipping april 4th

45:27.720 --> 45:33.400
the uh, teespring campaign ends april 4th and probably printing several days after that to make it in time for

45:33.880 --> 45:37.160
The end of april. So that's at teespring.com slash. Here's the thing

45:37.960 --> 45:39.960
I'm, pretty excited

45:40.520 --> 45:45.000
Yeah, it looks like we meet the threshold to uh ship so yeah awesome. Thanks guys

45:45.320 --> 45:48.760
I think uh, I think this could be a thing that we do at other fests too

45:48.760 --> 45:52.120
like if we could get the formula right we could do like a little sub event where we

45:53.000 --> 45:55.320
You know because a lot of so uh lugs in washington

45:55.320 --> 45:58.120
I would imagine everywhere but lugs everywhere will have um

45:58.920 --> 46:01.660
Uh install fest days. Have you seen this? Absolutely

46:02.280 --> 46:04.040
We have people, you know right there on site

46:04.040 --> 46:06.040
You can ask questions as you're trying to get things set up

46:06.120 --> 46:10.440
We could we could put together that kind of thing and like if this works like we could put together

46:10.920 --> 46:13.560
A meetup and we could get audience members that would help out with the initiative and you know

46:13.560 --> 46:18.380
Because really what you just need is like a production line people bring their laptops in or their desktops

46:19.480 --> 46:20.200
And you know it'd be cool

46:20.200 --> 46:25.640
Like if we really seriously got into this is if we could have like monitors and keyboards and mice there

46:25.640 --> 46:28.200
So they if they want to get their desktop switch, they just bring their tower

46:28.200 --> 46:30.520
They don't bring all their stuff and of course if they're bringing a laptop

46:30.520 --> 46:32.040
It's super easy and get a little networking in there

46:32.040 --> 46:34.280
So that way they could get we could send them home patched

46:34.840 --> 46:38.920
And all that kind of stuff 100 up to date just ask it. Hey what oh my gosh

46:39.080 --> 46:41.720
What are your favorite applications get their icons all set up for them?

46:41.720 --> 46:45.720
Like we could really do this and we could do it like itself. We could do it at scale

46:45.800 --> 46:47.480
We could do it at linux fest northwest

46:47.480 --> 46:51.560
That could be like a really cool thing we do when we go out there and it would always make for great like a little

46:51.720 --> 46:53.720
Like two minute update in the show, too

46:54.280 --> 46:57.320
So anyways, oh, sorry wimpy says he's not i'm sorry wimpy

46:57.320 --> 46:59.560
So anyways really excited about linux fest northwest

46:59.560 --> 47:01.880
You'll probably be hearing obnoxiously more about it

47:02.120 --> 47:03.960
And if you're uh, if you're ham radio

47:03.960 --> 47:07.160
You're really gonna hear more about it because we're gonna be coming your direction ham prepare your body

47:07.560 --> 47:10.120
Put pants on when they get there. We're coming for you

47:10.760 --> 47:11.640
and uh

47:11.640 --> 47:14.520
I got like a few things I got to fix in lady jupiter because you know

47:14.520 --> 47:20.040
What i've realized is living in an rv is like living in a boat and there it is a constantly decaying

47:20.520 --> 47:24.920
Object see in a house you you tell yourself that you could live in this thing for 30 years

47:25.320 --> 47:28.360
And you'll just have to fix up a few things here and there but about five ten years into it

47:28.360 --> 47:31.480
You realize there's like tens of thousands of dollars worth of work to do but with an rv

47:32.040 --> 47:37.400
Every month there's something to do now. It's not always as big but there's always something so right now

47:37.720 --> 47:41.320
Uh, I can't use my uh microwave when i'm on generator power. Why would you want to?

47:41.320 --> 47:45.720
I can't go pick up ham without a functioning microwave. So I gotta fix that i'm gonna try to fix that tonight after the show

47:46.120 --> 47:51.880
And so i'm beginning to repair it to get it ready for the road like each each major voyage you go on

47:51.880 --> 47:53.880
There's like a little something you got to do afterwards

47:54.280 --> 47:57.080
So that's mine is uh fix the uh fix the generator

47:57.720 --> 48:02.040
So that way the microwave and more importantly the electric fireplace work while we're on the road

48:02.040 --> 48:04.520
I mean ham has expectations about the mood in

48:04.520 --> 48:12.600
In late jupiter, all right, uh, very good. Very good. So i'm looking forward to that and and uh, you'll probably uh,

48:13.160 --> 48:16.360
Probably see some sort of video update soon with the ham smile and face on it

48:17.080 --> 48:19.800
And more from linux fast northwest and then of course if you can't make it

48:20.120 --> 48:23.080
We will be streaming it live and we'll have a meetup page hopefully launched

48:23.720 --> 48:28.600
Soon. All right. So i'm itching to tell you about something that uh, i'm surprised i'm this happy about

48:29.080 --> 48:32.360
Are you still are you in kd 5.6 right there? Uh, I switched back

48:32.360 --> 48:36.040
But i've been using it. Oh, you are no longer. Yeah, and now i'm trying it out in a virtual machine

48:36.120 --> 48:38.920
Oh, look at you. Look at you. Look at you. Well, okay, so it came out today

48:38.920 --> 48:41.160
So we got to talk about i've been running it for a few days here

48:41.480 --> 48:43.560
And uh, it's easier than ever now to try it

48:43.560 --> 48:46.920
There's like many options and I know we have a few different people trying a few different ways

48:47.400 --> 48:51.000
In the mummer room plus i'll tell you about how i'm trying it and we'll find out how west is trying it too

48:51.320 --> 48:53.320
And how you can try but first

48:53.400 --> 48:55.400
Let's talk about digital ocean

48:55.960 --> 48:59.960
Love digital ocean, uh speaking of some of our plans for linux fest northwest

48:59.960 --> 49:03.080
Yeah, some of them involve spinning up droplets when we go on location

49:04.040 --> 49:06.860
You know if you want to stream to multiple destinations

49:07.480 --> 49:09.480
You could do that from your connection

49:09.560 --> 49:11.880
But if you really want to have high resolution streams

49:12.120 --> 49:17.080
You could consider also streaming from a digital ocean droplet. OBS is very easy to send from one spot to the other in fact

49:17.080 --> 49:19.320
Uh tax syndicate just recently did a video on this

49:19.320 --> 49:24.280
We were kind of concocting this solution for our new setup digital ocean droplets are just our go-to infrastructure

49:24.280 --> 49:27.640
You need a linux rig with a super fast connection a blazing fast cpu

49:27.640 --> 49:30.360
That's crazy easy to manage and a beautiful ui to set up

49:30.600 --> 49:34.440
That's digital ocean starts at just five dollars a month. You get 512 megabytes of ram

49:35.000 --> 49:38.920
All ssds the five dollar one gives you a 20 gigabyte ssd with a terabyte

49:39.720 --> 49:43.400
Of transfer and of course their pricing structure just works really simply and it goes up from there

49:43.400 --> 49:48.520
If you just need it for a few hours easy peasy their interface is so simple. You can be a server master

49:49.560 --> 49:56.280
Working on servers since servers were a thing or you could be a total noob and you will still find digital ocean's interface appealing

49:56.280 --> 50:00.360
Isn't that like an amazing? It's awesome. That's like a line they have struck that is very rare, especially

50:00.440 --> 50:02.360
Let's just be honest in a web app

50:02.360 --> 50:05.640
Like it almost never happens in a web app and I mean if anyone's going to complain about it

50:05.640 --> 50:09.720
It's going to be you so the fact that you like it. It's very I don't yeah, you're right about that

50:09.960 --> 50:13.320
Also, they have a great api which meant love that api you can use that api

50:13.400 --> 50:16.360
You can tap that api all you want or you can take advantage of the open source code

50:16.360 --> 50:20.120
That's already done that and then you can just and it's like it's like one curl be like, yeah

50:20.120 --> 50:25.320
Bam lazy web. You got it. Boom. Uh, check them out digital ocean.com use our promo code do unplug

50:25.320 --> 50:31.720
That's how you support this show do unplugged all one word lowercase gives you a ten dollar dollar credit over digital ocean

50:31.880 --> 50:36.360
You can spin up an ubuntu rig a debian rig a fedora free bsd

50:37.000 --> 50:37.960
uh

50:37.960 --> 50:43.080
I do generally ubuntu lds, but I don't judge if you do free bsd. I won't judge and the

50:44.120 --> 50:49.560
Bsd now guys have talked about a few cool ways. You can use that html5 console on digital ocean

50:50.120 --> 50:52.120
To actually install other bsds as well

50:52.120 --> 50:57.160
Or arch or whatever you want. Yeah, i'll just the power of kvm. We're just gonna put that out there

50:57.160 --> 51:00.760
Yeah, because they're using kvm as the virtualizer. Uh, it's a really great infrastructure

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
It's a great infrastructure based on linux

51:03.480 --> 51:09.080
A great way to run linux rigs and a great way to support the show digital ocean.com. Just use that promo code

51:10.280 --> 51:15.880
Do unplugged all one word lowercase and a big thank you to digital ocean for sponsoring the linux unplugged program

51:15.960 --> 51:20.600
And i'll just give a quick shout out too. Um, we haven't talked a lot about this features, uh, since it first came out

51:20.600 --> 51:26.780
Floating ips are a brilliant way to make you to make a 10 operation look like a 50 million dollar operation

51:27.080 --> 51:30.520
And team accounts if you're an open source project or in a business are also

51:31.160 --> 51:37.800
Rocking so check them out digital ocean.com use the promo code do unplugged. They're really great data centers all over the world

51:37.960 --> 51:39.960
Thank you digital ocean

51:41.240 --> 51:45.800
Okay, so anybody in the mumble room running like a uh, um

51:45.800 --> 51:52.920
Um leap or uh or tumbleweed with that with a current version of plasma desktop installed on their machine in the mumble room

51:53.640 --> 51:54.600
I am

51:54.600 --> 51:56.920
Oh, can you can you describe your setup a little bit to me?

51:58.520 --> 52:05.320
Uh, yes, it's uh, just uh, the most current version of plasma on tumbleweed. It's very basic

52:05.560 --> 52:07.560
Do you know is that five six already?

52:08.200 --> 52:12.120
I believe it's five point five point six or something like that

52:12.120 --> 52:16.600
Well, sir, that is no longer the latest because today plasma 5.6, which i'm sure you'll get very soon

52:17.000 --> 52:20.600
Has been released and uh, it is interesting and also

52:21.240 --> 52:24.760
It comes with a video. How about this? I don't think i've ever seen plasma

52:25.240 --> 52:29.000
Kde desktop do this and it's it's kind of interesting. We could watch a few seconds of it

52:29.800 --> 52:36.520
So it is the time to release plasma 5.6, which brings many improvements and features to your desktop

52:36.520 --> 52:43.660
The default plasma theme breeze now follows the application color scheme allowing for a more personalized experience

52:49.800 --> 52:53.260
K runner gained cleaner look and support for drag and drop

52:59.560 --> 53:04.600
The much improved task manager in plasma 5.6 now displays proper

53:04.600 --> 53:11.640
5.6 now displays progress of tasks such as downloading or copying files. This is actually kind of a neat feature

53:11.720 --> 53:15.320
So, uh in dolphin when you're moving files around in the task manager

53:15.560 --> 53:20.520
There's a little loading bar that goes across the dolphin entry to indicate the progress of the file copy

53:20.760 --> 53:23.260
Isn't that kind of a nice little touch? It's a nice touch

53:29.320 --> 53:33.800
Playback a music or video player shows beautiful album art and media controls

53:33.800 --> 53:39.560
This actually hasn't worked for me yet. But the idea is like when you hover over a task bar, uh, um entry

53:39.880 --> 53:43.800
For your task manager normally you'd get like a plasma window that pops up with a preview of the window

53:44.040 --> 53:51.480
Well with like vlc or sandstorm or um, not sandstorm what app I don't know what application that is, uh or spotify

53:52.440 --> 53:56.840
You you get not only a preview of the window, but you actually get little player control bars at the bottom of that little

53:57.640 --> 54:01.800
Comp is like a pop-up preview. I don't know what you call that. So you never have to leave the application

54:01.800 --> 54:03.800
You're currently working with

54:11.160 --> 54:16.840
Users that place a folder applet in their panel can now choose between list and icon view

54:22.100 --> 54:25.800
Additionally tooltip animations have become more subtle

54:25.800 --> 54:27.800
I

54:30.200 --> 54:37.240
Like this next one desktop widgets all windows get minimized and the widget explorer becomes semi transparent during drag

54:37.320 --> 54:39.320
Isn't that cool? Yeah, that's nice

54:41.880 --> 54:48.920
Activity manager backend was revamped so creating and switching between activities should be noticeably faster

54:48.920 --> 54:53.480
This release brings back the weather and media frame widget I actually like that

54:55.000 --> 54:58.780
If you enjoy using plasma, please consider donating to kde

54:59.320 --> 55:05.240
So we can continue to work together and make the best free software possible. I guess I shouldn't cut her off

55:05.320 --> 55:08.600
Uh, so there you go. She just sort of covered some of the features of 5.6

55:09.160 --> 55:13.000
So here it was my takeaway and then I want to get your takeaway and then we'll go to the mumble room

55:13.400 --> 55:15.400
um, and then we'll wrap it up, but uh

55:15.400 --> 55:21.080
Something really weird happened to me this week and i'm really uncomfortable with it because i've never been in this position before

55:21.640 --> 55:24.600
Never yeah, and i'm glad wimpy's not here anymore wimpy you left, right?

55:24.680 --> 55:28.040
Good, oh good because I would feel bad even saying this if he was listening because I would just feel awful

55:29.320 --> 55:33.800
I found myself. Uh, so this here is the libram that i'm running a 5.6 on

55:34.520 --> 55:40.200
And I have the apollo still running abutu mattei 1510, which is now i'm just using as my portable and I have this one here

55:40.280 --> 55:41.800
I know here's the thing

55:41.800 --> 55:49.400
I found myself every time I wasn't using this desktop missing plasma 5.6. Wow little things. Um, like, uh,

55:49.800 --> 55:55.080
I uh, I was at home and my mi-fi dropped out actually didn't drop out. I restarted it

55:55.640 --> 55:57.640
And uh when I restarted it

55:58.760 --> 56:05.880
I could never get abutu mattei to refresh my available wireless networks and connect to it again and right here on kd plasma 5.6

56:05.880 --> 56:07.400
There's just a little refresh button

56:07.400 --> 56:12.040
You just click and it just refreshes all the wireless networks. Now. I'm not saying that's what i'm saying. There's there's about a million

56:12.120 --> 56:14.280
Of these little things now in 5.6

56:14.920 --> 56:20.360
That have been refined and come together to actually make a really tremendous desktop

56:21.160 --> 56:27.880
Um, it's really performant. It's really fast. I I don't I I mean mate is fast as well

56:28.040 --> 56:33.960
But it's definitely faster than gnome 3 as somebody who drives gnome 3 all the time. It's definitely faster than gnome 3

56:33.960 --> 56:39.800
uh, and there are things in it like the new krunner looks a lot better

56:39.800 --> 56:43.400
You can do alt space to launch the new krunner and it's cleaner. It looks better

56:43.720 --> 56:46.200
It searches like a son of a gun man. Yeah, it does

56:46.200 --> 56:50.280
It is a one of the best test top searches krunner itself is really powerful

56:50.280 --> 56:54.280
And there's a whole bunch of other functionalities. You know what too and I this is always something i've always known

56:54.280 --> 56:58.040
And one of the reasons I always kind of have been sort of attracted to a kde desktop or a plasma desktop

56:58.600 --> 57:01.240
Console is one of the best things to do. It's a lot of fun

57:01.240 --> 57:05.480
Kde desktop or plasma desktop console is one of the best terminal emulators out there

57:05.640 --> 57:08.440
Have you ever had like three or four tabs open to your servers?

57:08.600 --> 57:12.520
Did you know you can send and the other terminal applications do this as well, but this is the default guys

57:12.760 --> 57:15.640
Did you know you can send your input to all of your tabs at once?

57:15.720 --> 57:19.640
So like if you want to do app dash get update across all your machines

57:19.720 --> 57:24.920
You can be ssh'd in tab tab tab and just say execute this command right in console across all my tabs

57:24.920 --> 57:31.160
And you could update all your you know, it's just it's a great console application. Kate is a great text editor dolphin

57:31.240 --> 57:35.160
Is a great file manager like really good and the problem has always been

57:35.560 --> 57:39.320
The problem has always been for me since they went to version 5 has been plasma shell itself now

57:39.480 --> 57:44.360
It did actually crash on me in the pre-show and hopefully that'll be in the after show if you guys want to see that

57:44.680 --> 57:47.160
Uh, but we're able to recover like I didn't have to restart

57:48.120 --> 57:49.640
back up and running

57:49.640 --> 57:53.160
Here's where i'm at with this and this is why i'm genuinely excited about this

57:53.160 --> 57:55.640
Every single stinking release of kde

57:56.520 --> 58:00.200
Since about 5.3 has been for me personally

58:01.560 --> 58:09.000
Remarkably better and now 5.6 is the accumulation of much needed improvements to the breeze theme the breeze theme is

58:09.480 --> 58:15.800
Much more consistent now. They have the icons much more flushed out. It adopts whatever color choices you've chosen

58:15.800 --> 58:21.880
The default layouts at least on this kubuntu with neon, uh packages installed are much more

58:21.880 --> 58:27.400
uh clean and sensible there's i'm not overloaded with choice and um

58:28.920 --> 58:31.720
I kind of feel like it feels more modern than

58:33.640 --> 58:36.280
Gnome 3 in some ways, uh, like, uh

58:37.240 --> 58:40.440
The way the way okay. Here's just an example. So it's just been really nice

58:41.240 --> 58:44.200
All of my icons down there are just working and I know that's not the case

58:44.200 --> 58:47.160
My icons down there are just working and I know I don't know exactly why

58:47.800 --> 58:53.400
But like I I have my chrome icon. I have my hangouts icon. I have my dropbox icon down there in my system tray

58:53.640 --> 58:55.560
And you know what wes?

58:55.560 --> 58:59.880
They don't have ugly white boxes around. They don't like they're not oddly sized

58:59.960 --> 59:03.960
They're not mismatched in size like they used to be on the plasma desktop. They're all consistent

59:03.960 --> 59:07.080
They all look good and I have the power to hide them if I want to

59:07.720 --> 59:09.160
um

59:09.160 --> 59:14.680
Yeah, I just for me I I i'm actually seriously considering putting

59:14.680 --> 59:18.360
Plasma 5 6 on everything and just going all in for a little while and see how I feel wow

59:18.440 --> 59:22.920
I've never uh, oh so I before I go too much further actually before I I will follow up

59:22.920 --> 59:26.520
I i'll write it down so I don't forget because i've got a lot of questions after our our our

59:27.000 --> 59:29.560
Our friday or sunday show so I will write down the questions

59:29.720 --> 59:33.240
I wanted to hear your thoughts because i've been talking for a little bit. What would you try it out on the spot nick?

59:33.240 --> 59:34.440
What did you think?

59:34.440 --> 59:37.400
No, I was also similarly impressed. I feel like for a little while

59:37.400 --> 59:43.000
Plasma 5 had felt kind of like the early days of gnome 3 where I really liked what they were doing

59:43.000 --> 59:44.760
I liked all the changes. I liked seeing the updates

59:44.760 --> 59:46.760
But it the same kind of thing where it just wasn't quite

59:47.160 --> 59:51.320
Stable enough where I'd had enough problems or enough things had changed. I wasn't sure how they were going to work out

59:51.960 --> 59:57.800
But I really enjoyed it. It worked really well. Um, I was using kubuntu on here. It's been working very nicely

59:58.360 --> 01:00:01.080
I want to try maybe something like open seuss with it as well

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:05.560
I think that would be entertaining and that might be something that I would consider putting on like friends computers

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:12.440
Uh, but it has been it still might personally kde is always still feels like a lot of you know

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:16.520
It's a huge it's a huge desktop environment and it does what it does really well, but it takes over everything

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:21.320
So I don't know if i'll be using it every day. But for systems where that's what I want. That's an interesting

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:22.040
It works really well

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:24.120
That's an interesting comment and an interesting way to put it in kits

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:29.320
And I kind of wanted to let you jump off from uh from wes's point there because you say you like the way it feels

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:34.760
Yeah, I like the way it feels. Um, and i'm actually a traditional gnome user believe it or not

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:37.240
And I think that the reason that it works so well

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:42.600
And and I think the reason that you like it too is because it feels like how a computer should work

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:44.760
It doesn't feel like a touch interface

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:47.480
shoehorned onto a desktop

01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:51.320
Wow, that is a good point. Yeah, that is a good point, you know the other thing that uh,

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:54.520
Because and because I haven't been using it for a while

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:58.920
So there's still novelties to me that uh are are fun. Like when you take a screenshot

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.080
They just have like one of the best screenshot applications and it like you have you can

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:09.160
With a little bit of work you can send like your screenshots to third-party services right from the screenshot application like imager

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:12.360
Or stuff like that. They have great online account integration

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:17.560
I'm going to stick with it for a bit and I might try loading on the apollo, too

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:21.800
Anybody else in the mobile room want to jump in on their thoughts on kde?

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:24.920
And i'd like to know if you've what distros you've been trying it on

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:32.840
I've used uh 5.5.6 on multiple different distros. I haven't used 5.6 yet, obviously, but uh

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:39.100
I mean everything that a lot of the stuff that they mentioned in this is actually already in 5.5.6

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:46.120
Like the media player, uh plasmoid is really cool because you can create custom shortcuts

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:52.760
So that when no matter what media player is playing you can actually automatically like pause something or move move songs

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:58.760
Regardless of what actual player you use so you can always have the same global shortcut and that's really awesome. Oh, that is nice

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:02.280
Mm-hmm. That is nice. So rotten sounds like you've been sticking with it for a while

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:05.160
What is it that's been sticky for you about plasma desktop? What's kept you there?

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:10.040
Uh, well, I switched uh a year ago actually about a little bit over a year ago

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:15.000
And i've i've gone back and forth with different ds, but i've always gone back to kde now

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:21.080
And it's because uh plasma has a infinite amount of control like if you want to have

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:27.480
Like for example, uh kissanay said that he liked it because it was a traditional desktop and it wasn't like a touch thing

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:30.440
But if you want a touch looking desktop you can do that

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.720
I actually have like if you've seen my setup it kind of looks similar to gnome

01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:38.440
Because I can change it to the way I want it to look

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.560
But that that's one of the that's the power of plasma

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:47.640
But the the huge the biggest reason to use kde plasma is actually kwin

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:55.000
Because you can do that's fair pretty much anything you want to do with kwin anything that any other window manager can do

01:02:55.320 --> 01:03:00.280
Kwin can do it and there's tons of things that only kwin can do. I am continually impressed with kwin

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:06.600
Yeah, and I think it's a big part of the why the 5.6 desktop feels so responsive to the based compared to the gtk

01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:11.240
Desktops and i'm talking about like resizing windows or when the way they draw it just feels

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:17.560
It feels like a little bit like how good how good compass feels to me compass and kwin

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:23.240
I can perceive a difference in the way that mutter renders things or whatever gnome is using uh, so yeah

01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:28.760
I mean just even on my virtual machine when you like drag drag the window around it

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:34.200
It's fast. It's yeah the transparency works like in a vm. Yeah

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:38.280
There's a really cool default feature a hold alt and then use your right click

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:43.400
The right click mouse on any corner and you can resize the window super fast

01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:49.320
Oh, so you don't have to get like all accurate with where you grab it that is nice, right?

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:52.840
There's also the one of the things that I like this is actually the reason why

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:57.640
I was having a conversation with here on mumble and someone said uh, that

01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:01.240
Like we have a conversation about games and full screen and stuff

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:06.360
And you know, sometimes window mode games are better. Yeah, then are better performers than right screen, right?

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:12.280
If in in kde with kwin you can use uh, there's the no borders rule

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:18.200
So you can actually just put a game in window mode and then right click the title bar

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:24.280
And go and go through the process of more options and click no borders. It removes the border full screen that window

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:29.080
And it looks like it's a full screen, even though it's not. Yeah, the thing that I love about windows is

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:33.560
It's a full screen even though it's not. Yeah, the things you can tweak are pretty impressive. That is really cool

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:36.600
Uh, so that yeah that I could see that making it sticky for you, uh

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:41.800
Wizard you've tried it on debian. I don't think we've gotten a debian take yet. What what's your impressions?

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:46.280
Uh, so i've had ups and downs with it all the way through I stuck around

01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:52.520
I went through the kde 4 to kde 5 transition inside of debian and it was terrifying but uh,

01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:58.920
It's uh, it was it ended up working out really well, uh, you know, there's there's been ups and downs

01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:03.000
I've had i've been through the points where the desktop has crashed continually. That's actually why

01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:05.800
That's I had that script sticking around somewhere

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:09.400
because my desktop crashed a lot at the beginning, but it's

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:16.760
It's been getting better every and like I it's getting to the point where I have to use that restart plasma

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.520
Uh the script I use maybe once every couple months

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:27.720
You know, it's it's really good now. Yeah, in fairness. I have a restart cinnamon script. So yeah. Yeah, isn't that built into cinnamon?

01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:34.920
Yeah, but well, there were some other features. So, you know what really sucks super super bad, uh, uh, and it's

01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:40.440
It's just what it is right now, but the discover or muon or whatever. It's called software center. Um,

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:43.240
Are you seeing this?

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:47.080
I mean, I know they're trying and I don't want to be mean but look how awkward this is

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:53.720
So let's go into oh, I don't know. Let's go into system settings, right? So that's a category system and settings and look at this wes

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:56.040
it's just

01:05:56.040 --> 01:06:01.160
Blank like there's just there's just appear to be anything there. There's nothing there and like the icons are all strange

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:04.840
You know what's right here are widgets like the weather widget awesome widgets

01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:08.600
uh compared to the software boutique or

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:12.840
Um app grid. Yep on for yeah, i'm just talking for ubuntu systems

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:17.480
The software boutique is what uh is what wimpy's been working on which is just awesome

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:23.160
This is I installed vlc, but I mean this is just this is a huge disappointment

01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:26.840
I like that it's cross distro that is a nice like gnome software in that sense

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.080
I do I respect that I understand it's a big challenge, but I am not like

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:35.960
I need to deliver more what I want from the boutique and what I want from ubuntu software center

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:38.440
And what I want from muon discover, whatever you want to call it

01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:44.840
I want to find a new app that it delights me and I want to install it on my desktop and I

01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:47.960
I want to I want to then share it with linux action show audience

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:51.000
I want to discover new software via this I you know

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:56.840
I didn't necessarily do that with the software boutique, but you know, I installed a whole bunch of apps in about five minutes

01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:03.080
That was really I mean for people they're going to get ubuntu mattei 1604 and they're going to they're going to launch that welcome center

01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:05.240
They're going to in in five minutes

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:09.960
They're going to have their entire software stack and and what would they learn about what a ppa is?

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:10.760
You won't have to deal with anything

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:14.440
It just takes care of all of that for you and it gives you the best software on linux in minutes

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:19.880
This doesn't do that. This does speculate. Uh, this does speculate this does spotlight

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:24.600
Uh digicam vlc carita, you know some really solid qt applications

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.800
But just doesn't do just and marvel but just doesn't do justice to all the desktop applications available for linux

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:31.800
And I find it to be a major disappointment

01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:39.000
That one actually used to be better but they started recently as in five point five point three update

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:43.800
They started porting it more because it used to just not be on framework five

01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:48.120
Then they started porting it and they changed a lot of stuff that I don't really like

01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:52.040
Like the update system is actually it used to be much better than it is now

01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:55.720
So check this out, uh, just to kind of give you an example west now

01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:59.480
I don't have anything loaded uh in this vlc media player. So it's not as cool

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:03.880
All the lower third is probably going to block this but as I hover over vlc and my task manager

01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:07.720
You can kind of see it there west you see I have play and previous and next

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:13.000
And I can also it's so it's integrated now into the freaking task manager our playback controls

01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:16.360
And the reason why this is a big deal for me is I play a lot of media through vlc

01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:18.200
I'm usually using live streamer

01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:23.480
Or i'm grabbing the rtsp stream of something and i'm tossing or i'm throwing an mp3 and i'm listening to a podcast

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:26.920
And so to be able to just play and pause right there is neat

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:32.600
It's it's neat because it's a different way to do it and it accommodates for multiple media applications at once

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:36.440
So whereas a media applet will just do whatever application is controlling the volume

01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:42.600
This I can manage spotify vlc and the other just for me because i'm sometimes running several apps. Yeah, exactly really nice

01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:50.360
This is just a really tight desktop really well performing and uh, one of the other things true to their word the kde neon project

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:56.040
Already has a developer version now. Remember this is really just for testing and developing

01:08:56.040 --> 01:09:00.680
It's not for daily use. They already have an iso out with 5.6. I'll have it linked in the show notes

01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:02.680
You can download this and try it out right now

01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:05.320
The uh, the kde neon project

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:10.140
Has their files hosted at files.kde.org

01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:12.140
Kde.org

01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:16.700
They're all in with the kde project. Uh, so anyways if you want to try it out if you want to try out 5.6

01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:18.460
We do have

01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:20.940
Uh a link in the show notes you can cook. I i'm i'm i'm

01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:24.380
This is kind of a big deal for me and I don't want to

01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:28.940
For me this feels huge because not only am I thinking about switching to kde, but i'm thinking about switching

01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:34.300
To neon specifically wow in anticipation of 1604. Yeah

01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:39.500
And to be switching not only from gnome, but to also be switching from arch

01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:44.060
That's a big change. It feels like a mistake almost but uh, because arch will have 5.6

01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:47.580
Yeah, and I already have it but the neon project

01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:52.940
Itself is such an interesting experiment and 16 of 1604. It looks like such a promising release

01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:55.340
I know and even if I don't stay with 1604

01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:59.260
It's like I feel like I have to install it and use it for a while just to like be in the zeitgeist of what?

01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:02.540
It releases. Yeah. Yeah, so but it's funny because you know

01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:07.020
My 1604 review is coming up and it's like I need to immerse myself in unity and yet here I am

01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:09.900
I'm extremely attracted to 5.6. Yeah

01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:14.220
So, uh, yeah, I don't see I know I know I know I know it gets in

01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:15.500
You can go ahead and mention it on the air

01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:19.100
You don't have to just type it you want to give a plug for tumbleweed. We should mention tumbleweed. Go ahead

01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:24.780
Yeah, I actually think that you should uh, give tumbleweed a try. I think you'd have great luck with it

01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:32.380
I have I really haven't ran into any problems or surprises updating anything and i've been running it for almost a month now

01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:36.460
Sonic's 7-1-1 in the chat room says i'm chasing the dragon. I should be careful

01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:41.020
You know, you might be right and here's what I was thinking is I would like to really try to give it a go

01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:44.300
And so you want some of you listening might be wondering

01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:46.300
Well, what about your sound problems chris?

01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:50.300
And this was like the number one question that got sent into the linux action show now

01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:57.820
Uh, yeah by all in on phonon. Am I am I super excited about phonon? No, but in recent uh, kde releases

01:10:57.980 --> 01:11:01.340
I think I might have been in 5.5. Uh, they have they have

01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:03.980
Well, who who who?

01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:08.220
So 5.5 started it. Yes, and then 5.6 is the more full

01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:13.340
Implementation. Yeah. Yeah, I kind of suspected those guys. Thank you for the clarification. Uh, so

01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:16.060
I can do a process of elimination now

01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:22.700
That essentially prevents problems it requires I manage it more but it allows me at the same time I can manage it

01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:29.020
So it's actually not bad. So if you're looking at my screen right now on the video version here of linux unplugged

01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:32.060
You see i'm in the audio volume settings

01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:37.020
And you can just get there by right clicking on the volume volume applet and going to um audio settings

01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:41.180
All the tabs are super important input devices output devices, but you see something here west

01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:44.860
You see how I only have one device listed in output devices. Yes, I do

01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:47.900
And you see how I only have one device listed in input devices now

01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:52.140
Uh, there are some instances where I have a machine that literally has three sound cards in it

01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:55.260
The hdmi port a usb sound card and the onboard

01:11:56.060 --> 01:12:01.180
Well what you can do now in starting like rotten said in 5.5 and continued in 5.6 and there's other things as well

01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:06.620
But uh, but one of the nice things is is I can simply just turn those other sound cards off

01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:11.660
And then the plasma desktop isn't even aware they're available and it can't cock it up

01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:14.620
It's literally it's you just choose what you actually want to use

01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:14.780
Yeah

01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:20.700
By a process of elimination by eliminating all the other sound cards as an available options to the system and only making the one sound

01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:23.340
Card I want available everything defaults to it

01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:28.060
Solve my problem. And so I am now able to use the plasma desktop and

01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:30.940
And drive the sound effects from this machine

01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:33.740
And not have it randomly change sound cards on me

01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:38.140
Or what was happening to me in plasma before is some desktop application would use one sound card

01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:41.580
And other ones would use another sound that's the worst he's awful

01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:46.620
So that was the number one question that came in after last is but what about the sound because i've gone on and on about that

01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:52.940
Problem. I don't think it's particularly solved but because I can disable devices that I don't want to use it solves the problem for me

01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:54.540
So there you go

01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:57.340
Problem solved if you don't have two three sound cards in a machine

01:12:57.340 --> 01:13:00.380
It's not as big of a deal. But most of us these days do have hdmi out

01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:06.460
And if that supports sound which it does then probably have your nice usb dag. I mean, yeah now, you know, I haven't

01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:09.100
Hmm

01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:14.300
I haven't tried it on the deck upstairs where I had a problem. It would reset the volume to maximum. Ooh, that would be phase two

01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:20.860
That's phase two. Yeah, it is because the speakers up there are my editing speakers and they are loud dude

01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:24.380
It literally I think I think it gave me a heart palpitation when the first time

01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:29.100
Because it was like a kd like error message like a bring air and it was so loud

01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:34.140
My ears rang afterwards and rikai. I I think came out of him says everything. Okay, like like it was

01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:36.760
ridiculous, uh, yeah, so

01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:38.620
Kitson has that happened to you?

01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:43.020
Where it just resets the volume to maximum for like an application like what happened if I recall was

01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:46.380
Is for some reason an application volume got set low

01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:51.260
But the system volume would be set to 100 and so a system message would come up at 100

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:53.340
System messages. Have you gotten that kitson?

01:13:55.260 --> 01:14:00.940
I've had that happen a couple times. Uh, not recently the one big thing that happens to me is

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:06.540
Uh, my mic will get unplugged because I got an old mic and the connection's kind of janky

01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:12.380
And then i'll go to plug it back in and it'll be muted and I have to switch everything back over

01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:16.780
It doesn't default correctly. Yeah. Yeah, I you know, i'll see if I run into those kind

01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:19.020
I think the only way I can really find out is if I

01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:23.420
Try to jump in. Yep. Holy smokes. This is slick desktop

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:29.500
Oh, oh also should mention speaking of martin and kwin and how great kwin is, uh five dot six

01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:35.340
Real solid like this one will run on wayland release. This is the will run on wayland release. That might be fun to try

01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:41.340
Yeah, big deal now not ready for production not 100 but so much work has gone into making this freaking work on wayland

01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:43.420
And a lot of that work is showing up in five six

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:44.860
um

01:14:44.860 --> 01:14:50.940
Pretty cool pretty damn cool and you could probably just go try it out using the neon

01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:53.260
Uh iso in the show notes

01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:59.500
And you know all the you know, what's funny what's ironic what's ironic about this and the story of my life as a linux user

01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:06.540
Super I don't distro hop anymore. I desktop well actually i'm about to distro hop too. You are right god old habits die hard, don't they?

01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:14.060
Uh, what's what's really frustrating is all this freaking choice because also gnome 320 is about to come out and

01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:16.940
Gnome 320 is looking really good

01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:22.140
Yeah, so go figure i'm getting all excited about plasma desktop right as the new gnome is about to come out

01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:27.100
I just I uh, these are good problems to have though. Yeah. Yeah, we're first world problems for sure

01:15:27.340 --> 01:15:31.340
But yeah, I tell you what and you know what I I just uh, i'll just revel in it

01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:34.780
I'll just revel in it. I guess at least I have a place to talk about my problems

01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:36.780
You guys are like my therapy session. That's right

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:41.980
Okay, uh mumble room any uh closing thoughts before we move on from plasma desktop 5 6

01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:48.560
Yeah, I thought with that video that uh, kde was totally going the gnome direction with release announcements

01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:51.180
but I think that they

01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:57.260
Really messed it up. The music was awful. The voiceover was boring. You still need a good mic

01:15:57.340 --> 01:16:00.700
Yeah, and there was a little bit too much echo the music was kind of robotic

01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:05.900
Yeah, the uh, the music could be a little more excited like you could do something like a you know

01:16:06.220 --> 01:16:10.860
Plasma 5.6 is a brand new release from the kd, you know or something you could you could you could spice it up

01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:15.420
Just talk to chris. He'll do it. Yeah, totally I would too. Uh, but I actually at the same time

01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:21.020
I'm really glad because uh, one of the things that I have complained about

01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:27.020
Is how bad linux journalism is and when the projects are releasing videos themselves?

01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:31.660
Like you've been watching the mycroft project has done this brilliantly. Uh is

01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:34.300
You don't fumble the message

01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:37.660
You don't have a chance for there to be a misinterpretation because the journalist

01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:40.380
Well, not only will they get to write about what you're what you're doing

01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:42.140
But they'll just also embed your video

01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:47.740
It gives you an opportunity to speak to the public directly about what's great and new and not having it lost in translation

01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:53.020
Um, and now it's just a matter of refinement make it a little peppier make it a little more excited

01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:57.340
This is a big deal. A lot of awesome stuff just happened and you are excited about it

01:16:57.500 --> 01:17:01.020
I mean, I am more excited about it than the person that video was not to be too critical

01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:05.180
But let's be real and also yeah, the music did suck. But you know what at least they had music

01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:09.900
Yeah, the old cloud project didn't even have music right? So we're seeing we helped him out though

01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:13.900
This is legitimately a new interesting trend. We are seeing an open source

01:17:14.220 --> 01:17:19.660
We are going from the community that barely even has screenshots of our shit to the community that is creating video

01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:25.980
Videos. Yeah about our shit like that is a huge transition for us and one I completely support

01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:29.020
because if nothing else

01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:33.420
It gives people an opportunity to share something. I know that sounds stupid

01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:36.460
But you know a two minute youtube video is an easy share

01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:39.340
And you can spread the word and people can watch it. It's a lot easier

01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:42.620
Yeah, it's so much easier to be like hey check out this cool desktop. I'm using rather than

01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:48.380
Github readme with just text and like q5 says to point out is to help some control their image in the message

01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:52.940
Uh, and so that way, you know, it doesn't get fumbled by the quote-unquote journalists out there

01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:57.660
I I actually think it's a good trend but the problem is doing a doing a video

01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:00.300
And doing a good video

01:18:00.460 --> 01:18:05.100
Are hard that was that was that was a good attempt and I really I respect them for trying it

01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:07.340
They could they could spice it up a little bit

01:18:07.660 --> 01:18:10.860
Um, and it's just it just takes a little bit of time of trial and error

01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:14.780
I mean look at my look at my people who know how to do it and my early stuff is embarrassing as hell

01:18:14.780 --> 01:18:19.420
Like my current stuff is embarrassing as hell and i've been doing it for 10 years. So I can't give them that much crap

01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:22.640
You know what? I can talk about that and I do love this linuxacademy.com

01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:28.380
Slash unplugged go support the unplugged program and learn more actually go support yourself

01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:32.620
This is a great opportunity to learn more about any of the technologies built around linux the linux stack

01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:35.900
Or any of the really good stuff that people make money off of on linux

01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:38.540
And what I love about the linux academy is it isn't just a feature

01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:43.980
For their training website gotta have that linux and open source stuff on there. It's really what they're all about

01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:50.460
They got in this as a way to be advocates for linux programmers developers linux enthusiasts system administrators

01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:53.580
They got together and they built the linux academy platform. They now have

01:18:54.280 --> 01:19:00.060
2339 video self-paced courses downloadable comprehensive study guides seven plus distributions

01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:04.540
you get to choose from life server spun up on the demand with an ssh connection and

01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:09.020
Not only have they recently expanded into new offices launched an app for mobile

01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:15.340
But they've brought in a whole bunch of staff to get new content on board even faster and make sure older content stays relevant

01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:17.500
Because you know what turns out linux changes a bunch

01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:22.380
Like all the time and they get that, you know, it's not they're not going to just create something and let it rot

01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:29.020
They really have some interesting technology too like scenario based labs, which are right in the middle of a common everyday environment task

01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:31.500
So you really have hands-on experience and confidence

01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:34.360
Instructor mentoring is available, which is great

01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:39.640
Especially for stuff like this experts who like know what they're doing. Have you ever have you ever done like work training?

01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:40.840
Have you ever done like a work training program?

01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:45.480
I worked for a few places that would actually give me like a little bit like a like I was like like 1200 bucks a year

01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:47.560
Something like this. Have you ever had anything like that? No

01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:52.760
Yeah, I worked for a place or like well, we'll give you courses, uh, which is all on banking

01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:55.000
Uh, or you can get a 1200 budget

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:59.160
And so I just kind of worked that in moving too when I went into contracting and I worked for somebody as a contractor for

01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:02.040
A while. I still I had like a 1200 educational budget

01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:08.280
um, but that was because I was going to community colleges and I was going to like professional court training courses for citrix and

01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:16.840
And uh vmware and nothing nothing like linux academy existed for me now today something like linux academy would have changed my game

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:21.480
It would I could have taken on new clients and had the confidence to expand into different technologies fast

01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:25.080
I know I could have stayed current and part of that game was staying certified

01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:28.120
Even if it was for a review so that way I get a raise or if it was for getting a client

01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:30.440
It was just to make myself feel better and challenge myself

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:36.440
Having a resource like linux academy would have blown my face off linux academy dot com slash unplugged go there to support the show

01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:39.720
And blow your own face off. They got courseware on amazon web services

01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:43.560
They got the red hat certifications python ruby android development

01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:46.280
If you want to get into that biz php if you know what's good for you

01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:51.080
Don't tell michael dominic and of course the entire linux stack nginx apache ruby on rails

01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:53.400
All of it's over at linux academy dot com

01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:58.200
And they have a community that's stacked full of jupiter broadcasting members because i've been talking about them for a while

01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:01.880
In-depth resources are great. Listen to it in the shower or while you're on the go

01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:06.680
Mix it in with your podcast playlist and advance your skill set linux academy dot com

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:11.160
Slash unplugged and a big thank you to linux academy for sponsoring the unplugged program

01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:16.120
Check out their live stream archives, too. So

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:20.280
Google hangouts

01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:21.800
pretty damn good

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:23.160
hard to beat

01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:27.080
But not a ton of people no not open and uh, maybe a little creepy

01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:35.000
And so a couple of things have been submitted into the show recently one from producer rotten corpse and one from our very own

01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:35.800
wes

01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:36.600
and

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:42.120
They both in their own corners are powerful open source google hangout and skype killers

01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:44.920
And there's been a lot of hoopla around skype recently on linux

01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:50.120
So let's start with the new contender the one that most of us haven't heard about before

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.240
Hubble dot in you think i'm saying that right hubble dot in

01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:56.760
I think that's how you're saying it and I want to start up and I want it

01:21:56.760 --> 01:22:00.360
Let's do a let's do a meeting right now with our live chat room. So i'm going to go uh lup

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:04.840
Well, i'm just going to do slash lup. So it's uh, h u b l

01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:10.440
H u b l dot i n slash lup i'm going to start up a video conference right now

01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:16.120
And we'll see it and then we'll compare this to the other contender the other open source contender, which has recently gotten a whole

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:21.480
Bunch of real live science right here on linux. All right, so i'm going to set my name and look at this

01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:23.720
I like this right off the bat. So you set your name here?

01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:24.760
This is one thing that struck me

01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:31.000
But then look at this west choose your video quality low rate medium rate or awesome right up front. I'm gonna go awesome rate

01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:37.800
That feels good. Right? Okay, so now next. Okay. So now i've started it's going to ask for uh permission to use my webcam

01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:39.880
I'll say yes go ahead use my webcam

01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:42.280
And I could send email invites out to people

01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:46.360
Uh if I wanted to look at that, we already got we already got somebody in there. That's great. Yeah

01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:49.560
So there's poppy down there. That's awesome. That's really good

01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:53.160
Uh, that's cool. Hey guys, how's it going? Hello. Hi. Hi

01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:56.200
Hi, look at that

01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:59.560
Popey, oh, yeah, you're in the moment room. So you have your mic muted. That's cool

01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:02.680
And so you see it has uh, the little uh thumbnails down here

01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:09.640
Oh, we just had another another person join. So it's really easy for everybody get in there and uh, fatty fatso just got in there

01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:11.320
It's fatty fatso. He's in as the linux talks

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:13.160
He doesn't have to use video if he doesn't want

01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:16.920
You can turn off your microphone or your webcam if you want to be private for a moment

01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:21.560
Which is a kind of a cool feature. I mean really a needed one for any like enterprise scale use

01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:25.500
Here's what I like though. I gave out I gave out uh one url hubble.in

01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:30.920
Slash lup and now we've got one two three four five six people who've joined

01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:34.360
Now some of them have like that some of them are we're getting a little playback. So

01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:38.280
Uh, but that is it is nice. You have the ability to start a chat

01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:42.520
Uh now two more people just joined look at that. Hello ptd. Hello patrick

01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:45.400
So there we go. A couple more people just came in. Hi guys. Good to see you

01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:47.080
uh

01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:54.680
I love my microphones in the shot. Um, that is really nice slick easy to do way way quicker than hangouts. And here's a nice thing

01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:56.840
Look at this

01:23:56.840 --> 01:24:01.400
It is using peer-to-peer web technology. It's not going through their servers. They're not recording it

01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:05.560
It's all happening peer-to-peer. All right, i'm gonna hang up on you guys, but thank you. That was a good experiment

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:07.640
So okay, that's contender number one

01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:10.040
hubble

01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:12.040
Contender number two

01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:17.560
A well-established name someone we know with a varied history kind of trust

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:24.120
Used to use it on the desktop, but now they want you to use it on the web. Yes friends. It's jitzy

01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:28.280
And rotten corpse. You're the one that submitted jitzy for a contender this week

01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:33.800
Do you want to mention what it was about the new jitzy updates that uh, got you all excited and wanted to plug it on

01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:35.800
the show

01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:38.120
And by the way

01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:42.520
Before rotten starts it's meat dot jit dot si slash love

01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:46.520
I'll put the hopefully i'll be able to put the full uh url in the show notes. But okay, go ahead rotten

01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:51.720
You might be in transit right now. Oh, okay. Okay. Very good. So here we go

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:55.080
So you've joined charham join me. You can see me here. I'm on the uh, have you tried out?

01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:58.840
Have you tried out jitzy west? Yeah, i'm on there right now. Are you did you only?

01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:02.120
That's me

01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:08.520
Hi, chris. Hello west as you can see it's doing the automatic switching. Uh, hello fellow jitzer. So it just calls him fellow jitzer

01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:14.200
But I like how it's switching between them and also this one shows you the signal strength of individual people

01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:16.760
Which is kind of nice and oh look at this I can

01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:23.000
I can make I can make people disappear which is kind of nice. I can mute individual people. I can kick people out

01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:27.880
I'm digging this open close the contact list show or hide the film

01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:35.800
Oh, we should switch to this on last this just be google hangouts right there one button hide the strips that is really neat

01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:41.340
Look at everybody showing up. It's handling this connection just fine. So both of them using webrtc

01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:44.440
And we're both using it. Yeah

01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:50.600
This is this is a hard call, but I think I want to give the nod to uh, jitzy here for a couple of different reasons

01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:55.960
Uh a little bit these notifications when someone else connects too. Yeah, I like the jitzy notification system

01:25:55.960 --> 01:26:01.720
Jitzy meet also allows you to share documents with everybody participating share a prezzi session

01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:04.600
And it allows you to share your screen

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:09.080
So I think it has hubble beat a little bit. Yeah, this is a new update allowing you to share

01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:12.280
Your screen is really cool. So I i'm I would try it

01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:16.280
But then I would just share my screen share my screen of sharing you should try sharing your screen west

01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:18.280
Do you want to try sharing your screen?

01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:24.760
And then I think I can click you to bring you up. So there's west right there. I like this. Oh, wow. Look at that

01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:26.760
I can oh

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.640
I hover over your uh your signals there. Look at that west

01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:35.080
I get your exact bitrate that you're currently sending me right now and the resolution it says a little low resolution

01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:39.640
But of course, that's probably just your webcam. Yeah, probably so there's your screen up is the best

01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:44.120
Yeah, because here's uh, here's a mr. Uh, uh, let's see. What's it say?

01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:49.240
His name is lynn fax or something like that. He's sending me a different resolution than you are and uh,

01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:55.080
Uh, whoever this guy is he's sending me. Well, he's sending me the same resolution here. This guy looks like he's uh, hello

01:26:55.080 --> 01:27:00.040
Fellow jits are i'm bringing you up on screen. He's sending me no 160 by 90. I'm not sure

01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:04.760
I gotta play. I gotta see if I can get a high definition. What about me? What am I sending? What am I sending?

01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:09.720
I'm sending 320 by 180. So that would be the one thing is if I could get it up. Let's see settings

01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:13.080
Listen, which it is. You can start without audio. That's kind of neat

01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:20.120
Hmm, yeah, okay. I think that I think these are both pretty good winners here, but uh sam radio you have 720p on yours

01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:24.360
All right, well that's something

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.620
Huh? Hey citizen coming in with no video so you can still participate

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:36.120
I like that. This is pretty cool. I think bit I think if you need a google hangouts replacement that you want to be open source

01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:38.840
That works in your web browser

01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:44.280
I think I think you give it to meet.jit.si. We'll have a link in the show notes

01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:47.960
I did have to install a chrome extension to get the uh screen sharing to work

01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:50.760
But it installed very quickly. Yeah, it did if you did it on air

01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:53.480
Yeah, I mean it was just like one hit add and so are you able to go?

01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:57.160
So can you bring your screen back? Oh, you turned your screen off. Oh, okay. No, that's fine. That's fine

01:27:57.160 --> 01:28:00.760
Oh, we have somebody else. This is really cool. Oh, there's poppy. So what's poppy coming in now?

01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:06.440
Poppy's coming in at 640 by 380 for some reason and he's yeah, I don't know why he's not higher resolution video

01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:08.440
I don't know why it's not higher resolution video

01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:10.840
That seems to be the thing

01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:14.200
Got to play with that. Yeah, but this is a more controlled trial be interesting

01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:19.240
You can lock the room down too so people can stop joining you can invite others to join

01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:21.800
That is great

01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:25.480
So there you go to open source google plus. Oh, are you back rotten?

01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:30.360
No, it's not rotten it's me

01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:37.480
um, but I just saying just saying that uh, the another advantage that gt has over all of the other competitors

01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:41.800
Is that it has the video bridge with the gt from the desktop?

01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:49.000
So if someone is on the regular gt can talk, oh, so you could still use the desktop. That is damn cool, dude

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.960
That is really nice. I really like that the options something that

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
That's something that they've been working on

01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:57.320
Uh to to make it work, you know

01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:01.960
Um, we could use this so when poppy talks poppy could be on video

01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:02.680
Yeah

01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:07.480
That so poppy try talking in the mumble room while you're on gitsy video. See if you can pull that off

01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:11.640
That could be kind of yeah, I can do that. Oh, look at that. That is so cool

01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:15.000
And it's almost synced up too. Look at that

01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:19.240
This could be a cool way to get the actual faces of the bumble room on the stream if we want to take it up

01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:22.760
And I mean we have the video stream anyway. Yeah. Yeah, that is really neat

01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:25.080
I could I could route my microphone through this as well

01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:30.840
You could but but I don't know I think it's more because we're because the nice thing is you could have some people on here

01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:32.600
I guess i'd have to know when to switch it

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:37.400
I guess this could be used in place of mumble too, but I like the mumble room better for this kind of thing

01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:44.360
Yeah. All right. Well, very cool. So, uh, we'll have links to both of those open source google hangout and skype replacement

01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:47.400
So if you've been bellyaching about microsoft killing support for skype

01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:52.360
Uh, this might be a go-to replacement for family members chats with friends

01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:57.720
Yeah kits and you had something you wanted to jump in before we move on. Yeah, um, actually it's uh,

01:29:58.120 --> 01:30:00.120
Something that I found it's a different topic

01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:07.640
Did you see this thing about a uh rust written microkernel? I did and they were throwing some shade on linux if I recall, right?

01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:10.840
Yeah, this is really cool

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:16.120
Redox. Yeah. Yeah, and they were they were slamming linux a bit in their announcement. But yeah redox

01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:20.200
A rust written microkernel open source os. Yeah

01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:21.400
Yeah

01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:24.680
Yeah, I have heard of it. I just don't it's impressive. They've gotten a pretty good way

01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:29.640
They've got a gooey up and yeah, they say the whole thing weighs in at just 26 megabytes for that. So

01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:37.480
26 megabytes, maybe i'll give that a spin this week. You should dude. Can you report back? Yeah, that'd be pretty cool. That'd be pretty good

01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:43.960
Uh, all right. So, uh, that's probably the end. I love this. I uh wave. Goodbye poppy wave. Goodbye poppy

01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:47.480
Oh that beautiful beautiful poppy. Bye. Bye. Bye now

01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:55.160
Bye guys, thanks for testing the different uh, uh html webrtc powered solutions. I'm hanging up on your face

01:30:55.240 --> 01:30:59.160
It is nice to know that it's you know, we're all just connecting as peers. Thanks for using jitsi meat

01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:00.040
Yeah, you're right

01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:05.560
And you know what that's going to mean is hopefully I better connection speeds right and better latency and whatnot because you're not routing through

01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:10.040
A server and the nice thing is of course since you're not running through a server if nobody's recording your session

01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:16.120
You could record your session, but nobody else we recorded that session. We did we did that's an example of that

01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:21.640
All right. So there's a lot coming up on future episodes of linux unplugged, especially as linux fest northwest gets closer

01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:23.800
But also as some major distros release

01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:27.480
There's going to be a lot of stuff and a lot of opportunity for you to get your thoughts in on the show

01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:31.800
So please do join us live go over to jblive.tv. We do the show on tuesdays

01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:33.240
You can go to jupyterbroadcasting.com

01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:38.280
Slash calendar to get that s converted to your local time zone and then you join our virtual log via mumble

01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:43.480
Which is an open source communications program and you can get the server in our chat room the information by doing bang mumble

01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:47.000
It's kind of like our little like that's like that's like the hardest part

01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:48.600
That's the test to prove you're worthy

01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:49.960
You got to join the chat room

01:31:49.960 --> 01:31:53.160
You got to do bang mumble and you got to install mumble and then that's it

01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:55.240
You just got to have a working nice to blaster

01:31:55.320 --> 01:31:56.840
That's probably a good idea

01:31:56.840 --> 01:31:58.040
Uh, and it's our virtual log

01:31:58.040 --> 01:32:00.920
You can hang out with us and share your thoughts and as some big stuff is coming up

01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:03.320
It's a great opportunity for you to get in there and take part of it

01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:04.620
So we'd love to have you go to jupyterbroadcasting.com

01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:11.320
Slash calendar to get that converted to your local time zone and a big thank you to our virtual log for making it this week

01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:14.120
Thanks to west for once again saving the show by supplying the beer

01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:18.200
It's a close call to what I can the beer and the burger you want above and beyond this week, man

01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:21.160
That's pretty impressive. That means rika. I'll get this show out, you know

01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:25.480
Split greasely greased up with uh five guys grease that is gross

01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:30.280
Follow the network at jupiter signal for uh show announcements and live streams at chris

01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:35.480
Isles for my stuff about linux fest northwest linuxactionshow.reddit.com for feedback

01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:40.600
On this week's episode and topic suggestions. Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of linux unplugged

01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:43.740
And we'll see you right back here next tuesday

01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:12.600
So

01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:34.680
Why don't we why don't we kill a few minutes and talk about something I

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.920
I started to bring this up in tech talk and I shut the conversation down because I actually wanted to talk about it here

01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:43.560
In linux unplugged saved it. I know it so android n has been out for certain devices

01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:47.320
I don't think you've tried it yet though. I haven't no, but you could right on your nexus 5. Yeah, maybe I should

01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:52.360
Yeah, uh, well, I don't know if you'll be able to try this on the nexus 5, but one of the hidden features in android n

01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:53.940
is

01:33:53.940 --> 01:33:56.760
Multi-windowed mode so not just like side-by-side windows

01:33:56.760 --> 01:34:03.720
But like full-on broken up multi-windowing desktop environment with a bar down at the bottom a system tray quick launch icons

01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:09.000
awkward black around chrome desktop icons on the desktop android n is

01:34:10.180 --> 01:34:12.180
Potentially i'm looking at this thinking

01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:15.000
This could be a chrome os. This could be a chrome os killer

01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:17.880
Easily. Yeah, it looks like it

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Wow, could it also be

01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:23.080
an ubuntu desktop killer

01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:26.440
Because you get a linux based os and the x86 project is even more

01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:31.560
So you get a linux based os you get mainstream corporate applications like microsoft office

01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:39.320
Uh adobe lightroom you get an official telegram evernote you get google chrome netflix hulu, uh, all of that stuff

01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:42.440
on a desktop environment

01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:44.520
That could run on arm or intel

01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:48.920
I mean, maybe if you're like, you know, so I was looking at the stack exchange

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.800
Did you see the stack exchange survey that came out recently? Yes, I did

01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:56.760
And like the number one thing everybody's working on is web dev, right? That's like the well you could do web dev on this thing

01:34:56.760 --> 01:35:01.960
Potentially, you know, I suppose so take this thing like take this thing down to like like ang said in tech talk

01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:04.920
Take this down to like android q. So this has been around for a few years

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:06.520
I'm not saying with n this happens

01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:13.800
But android q you have a really well flushed out multi-windowing system that you could download an iso for and set up on a laptop

01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:16.280
Or buy a chromebook that actually runs this

01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:22.120
Yeah, okay, I can see it yeah, I can see installing it on people's machines

01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:27.480
I mean I might if it was flushed out. I might rather install this on my like a friend's machine than say windows

01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:34.060
What do you think about uh, like uh wimpy? What do you think about like like, uh, more hardcore work cases that like production?

01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:37.880
Development do you think something do you think it's ever going to be possible on something like this?

01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:44.280
Um, my question to you is if this is an ubuntu desktop killer. Can you produce a show on it?

01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:47.560
You know, I don't know about today

01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:54.600
But uh, there are becoming some decent media production tools for android like uh, there are um ice cast

01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:01.320
And um live video streaming rtmp and and twitch you could do from android devices on ios

01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:04.200
There's full-fledged video editors. I have not looked on android

01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:06.760
Maybe I don't think I don't think today

01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:08.840
But maybe one day

01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:10.200
hmm

01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:12.280
Yeah, what about what about you wimpy? Could you do your?

01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:18.600
Could you do most of your daily driving on an android device if it was multi-windowed on a powerful considerably powerful hardware?

01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:20.760
So say you could pick your x86 box of choice

01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:23.640
I don't need much power to do what I do

01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:30.040
Um, but yes, um, I have used android successfully to do the things I would need to do of a day

01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:33.000
I could definitely see this on a tablet

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.480
Like if you had a nice bluetooth keyboard and a good you know

01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:39.960
Like ssh program to get some work done and you have chrome up on one half of the screen terminal on the other

01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:41.960
That'd probably work for a lot of remote stuff
