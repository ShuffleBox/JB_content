1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You know, we had a little pre-show topic I thought maybe we could bring up.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Thanks to Raku Dave who gave us a TLDR and a translation in the Linux Action Show subreddit.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
A little update on the Limux situation. Remember that deputy mayor who was causing a ruckus?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Well, the deputy mayor's main complaint has been revealed, and it kind of betrays his total lack of technical expertise.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The deputy mayor's main complaint is there's no convenient way to access mails and appointments on mobile devices.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Apparently, confusing the Limux desktop with the current groupware solution, which is Colab Enterprise,

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
which is still ongoing as opposed to the old system. They're still rolling out, I guess.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
He then goes on to say that he doubts that the public sector can keep up to date with software that is years behind the latest version,

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
ignoring the fact that they were switching from Windows XP.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The only valid part of his objection seems to be that Limux is still based on Ubuntu 14.04 and KDE 3.5,

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
but they already have an update scheduled for Q4 of this year to go to LibreOffice, Ubuntu LTS, and KDE 4.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So this guy, he wants to move off Limux because he's not happy with mobile sync support. This is ridiculous.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Before we start the show, this is kind of a big moment today. I thought maybe...

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Whoa! Whoa!

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Oh, hello. Hello.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
There it is. Maybe do a Valve update.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Whoa, there's a Valve update for you.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So there's a few games out there in the world that are on people's like, I can't switch to Linux until this game ships for Linux.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Like, you know, like, oh, as soon as this game's out there, I'm going to switch. You just wait and see.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Well, one of those games is Counter-Strike Global Offensive. I just downloaded it.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's not even listed in the Steam store as supporting Linux.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Hey, look what they... Hey, I just played that.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Hey, look at that.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I guess I could have just done that. I guess I could have just played that.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So Steam, right? It's Global Offensive. Hello.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Came out today for Linux. I have no idea how to play.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But I'm going to give it a go. I just thought maybe we'd do this real quick.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Play. Oh, find a game.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Operation Breakout. Okay.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
This should go fine, right, Matt? I shouldn't have any problems.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Absolutely. Absolutely. That's how I play most of my games.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Right? There should be no problem here.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So, okay. It's initializing the world. I haven't set any graphic settings yet. This is the first time I think...

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm watching now so I can kind of be more of help.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
There you go. All right. So I don't even know what I'm doing. I guess it's casual.

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You saw me play Half-Life 2. I mean, that was painful.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
All right. Here we go. Hopefully I don't get swatted.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Spankage.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The message of the day. What kind of message of the day is that?

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm going to be a terrorist. That sounds like me.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's a little laggy. There we go. It's coming in now.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Terrorists win. Terrorists win.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I have no idea what I'm doing. There we go.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Oh! Now that I'm in...

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Oh, wow. You know how you know you're a terrorist because you're wearing a hoodie?

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yeah, right? Well, now that I'm in, it is smooth and looking clean.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Oh, this looks good.

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'll be checking this out, actually, because I'm kind of a Counter-Strike guy, so this is pretty cool.

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Oh, this is pretty sweet. This is pretty sweet.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yeah, I'm totally a terrorist.

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I was big into Soldier of Fortune 2 back in the day. I was like my de facto...

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I spent hours doing that.

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm going to come up with a backstory. Here's my backstory, Matt, okay?

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm a radicalized, homegrown, lone wolf terrorist.

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Radicalized via Instagram propaganda.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
There you go. I like it.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I have a car full of pressure cookers and this gun and my hoodie.

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The NSA can hear you.

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh, crap.

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Oh, no. Oh, no.

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm just living out a fantasy, that's all.

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Hold on. I didn't get this hoodie for nothing.

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Well, he is in a virtual training camp right now. That could be bad.

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yeah, exactly. You know what? I'm being radicalized right now and I'm recording it.

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Anyway, so there it is. It's legit.

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You're playing for the wrong side.

67
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I think this is my new first-person shooter for Linux.

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I think this is it. I think we just discovered Chris's new first-person shooter.

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Oh, jeez.

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Nice little tool tip there.

71
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I was just totally murderated.

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
All right, good enough. Good enough.

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
How much is that game? Because it looks awesome.

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's like 14 bucks, I think. Not bad.

75
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
That's reasonable.

76
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It doesn't have the penguin listed on the Steam store yet, but as you probably just saw, it does actually.

77
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And pro tip, a lot of times if you add something to your wish list and then it goes on sale, you'll get an email.

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Oh, that is nice.

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That's true. I do have a lot on my wish list.

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I always do that because I always forget what game I was looking at yesterday, so I was like, crap, what was it?

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yeah, my biggest thing is I have trouble justifying to my wife that I spent money on a video game.

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yeah, that is a good one. That's a good challenge.

83
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You've got to say, oh, hey, look what I was gifted with. Steam has those gift things.

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Or turn it into your work and then say, it's a business thing. I've got to do this.

85
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm not advocating lying. I'm just saying you can kind of bend the truth a little bit.

86
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That's all we're saying.

87
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's a birthday gift to myself. It's fine. Whatever, you know.

88
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Your PayPal account is wife don't know money.

89
00:04:47,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's powered by a broken USB 3.0 connector.

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
My name is Chris.

91
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And my name is Matt.

92
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I tell you what, Matt, these USB 3.0 connectors were designed to fail.

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I think it's like this giant punk on the entire consumers from the industry because I have this Zalman drive right here.

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's got junked up. Eric on the pre-show was talking about his drive got broken.

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I think, Matt, maybe we have stumbled upon the greatest conspiracy in all of computing.

96
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What do you think?

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I think it's actually time for us to remove the tinfoil hats and realize the tech industry is out to screw us over.

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And they do it one plug at a time, Matt.

99
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
That's right.

100
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I just hate it when I break a device.

101
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,000
All right, so coming up on today's show, are Canonical and Red Hat about to go at it like we've never seen before?

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Red Hat today announced they are pivoting the direction of the company and refocusing on the cloud.

103
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But, of course, that's what Mark Shuttleworth has been saying for years.

104
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
In fact, if you look over Mark Shuttleworth's blog, he talks more about Ubuntu in the cloud than he does about Ubuntu on a phone.

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So with both of these companies going at the cloud market, specifically OpenStack, where Canonical currently has a major lead, you've got to wonder what that's going to lead to.

106
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So we'll look at some recent statements and including a new announcement from Canonical today about a partnership with Oracle to extend their presence in OpenStack.

107
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And what Red Hat just made a big announcement about.

108
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So we'll get to that.

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Plus, we're also going to talk about Debian's recent switch back to GNOME 3.

110
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
But really, we'll do more of a meta conversation about what it might mean for the state of XFCE.

111
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
One of Matt's favorite desktops, is it a dead man walking?

112
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
We're going to talk about that today, too.

113
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
A lot of stuff, Matt, so we'll start with our feedback.

114
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
That's kind of tradition.

115
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Sounds good.

116
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You know, what we do here on the Unplugged show.

117
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yeah.

118
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And can you believe that we are almost episode 60?

119
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I don't think we missed a bit.

120
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Already?

121
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yeah, I know.

122
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Wow.

123
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I don't think we missed a single episode, too, which is awesome.

124
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Awesome.

125
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Okay, Matt.

126
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Our first email comes in.

127
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And this one's kind of funny.

128
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It was a follow-up.

129
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It comes from AR.

130
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It says, wow.

131
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I've seen and smelt the future of broadcasting.

132
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Hey, guys.

133
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I've been watching the Linux action show for well over a year and a half now.

134
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It starts my week with some great Linux content.

135
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It allows me to deal with the MS corporate world I'm immersed in.

136
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I just wanted to share with you a surreal experience I had on Monday watching the show.

137
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I was working on my emails whilst watching your latest episode on Security Onion.

138
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And unknown to me, my wife had returned from shopping and was preparing some food in the

139
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
kitchen.

140
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Halfway through your Security Onion section, the smell of cooking onions started to waft

141
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
into my home office, which had just added an additional dimension to the whole Security

142
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Onion experience.

143
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's like 3D glasses, but way better.

144
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Smell-O-Vision is the way forward.

145
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Keep up the great work.

146
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Highlight of my week regards AR.

147
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
How great is that?

148
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That is so awesome.

149
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I love Smell-O-Vision.

150
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
How great is it that we're doing Security Onion, and first of all, cooked onions are

151
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
delicious, and second of all, the smell of cooked onions is delicious, and third of all,

152
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
it goes perfect with the show.

153
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
He also says he ordered himself a dark blue LASS jacket.

154
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
That's awesome.

155
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Nice.

156
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So thanks, AR, for the story.

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
In fact, you know what?

158
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I didn't put this in the show notes, but maybe I will mention we are doing a fundraiser to

159
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
cover our cost to go over to Ohio Linux Fest and bring you coverage from Ohio Linux Fest.

160
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And you can help us do that, cover those costs, by going to teespring.com slash jbjacket.

161
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
We have a six-day run left of a limited time fall or maybe spring, depending where you're

162
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
at in the world.

163
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Linux Action Show Jacket is a zip-up jacket with a hoodie, so it'll be just right for

164
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
the weather.

165
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And we've sold 87 towards our goal of 100.

166
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Now at 100, we break even, and we unlock all of the sales.

167
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Anything above 100 will greatly help our cost, and we're also donating a dollar to the Ella

168
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
and Madison Fund, which are some family friends who recently went through a tragedy.

169
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You can read more about that at teespring.com slash jbjacket.

170
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Right now, we have blue, black, and dark gray.

171
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Keep checking.

172
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
There might be an additional color showing up soon.

173
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
No word on that yet.

174
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Ooh.

175
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yes.

176
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Teespring.com slash jbjacket.

177
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Go get yourself a Linux Action Show hoodie.

178
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You can rock the support for the show.

179
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
If you're at Ohio Linux Fest, you will know who you are.

180
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You'll be like, oh, yeah, it's the last few.

181
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Awesome.

182
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And if you're not, you can still remotely be there with us in spirit, wearing your jacket,

183
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
rocking it places.

184
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I've been wanting a jacket for a long time, but we were waiting for Teespring to get this

185
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
right.

186
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
They got a great set of materials.

187
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
They've done a couple runs of these now, and the timing is perfect.

188
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And, you know, we had to keep it a super short run, six days is all that's left, because

189
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
we want to get them shipped out in time for Ohio Linux Fest, which is going to be epic.

190
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Like I mentioned on Sunday, my wife Angela will be joining us, co-host of the Fo' Show.

191
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Well, host of the Fo' Show.

192
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm the co-host.

193
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And she's going to go down there and say hi to folks and shake hands, and we'll go around

194
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
and do interviews and all that kind of stuff.

195
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And I'm going to try to get her a jacket, too.

196
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I mean, that seems only fair.

197
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That seems like maybe, maybe I should do that.

198
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I think so.

199
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yeah, I think she'll probably take care of that.

200
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Teespring.com slash JBJacket if you want to help us get out to Ohio and rock some Linux

201
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
action show swag.

202
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
All right.

203
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
One quick thing I was going to mention about that, too, is when they're coming to the Fest,

204
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
it's like, what better way to recognize viewers than to see them in the jacket?

205
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I know, right?

206
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yeah.

207
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And other fellow viewers, too.

208
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So, like, there'll be a sense of community at the Fest because you'll recognize, oh,

209
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
that's safe territory over there.

210
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I can go talk to that person.

211
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Exactly.

212
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
They're a human.

213
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
They're a human.

214
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
That's it.

215
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Gordon writes in on the alternative to PFSense topic.

216
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You know, and I want to mention, too, in the Linux action show, I said, hey, I'd love to

217
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
get your take on different firewalls.

218
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I've gotten a ton of really good answers.

219
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm not going to necessarily cover which ones have been recommended.

220
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm going to wait and summarize all of that.

221
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So, a lot of them is in there.

222
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
But Gordon managed to touch on the topic that I wanted to kick around with you guys.

223
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
He says, hi, Chris and Matt.

224
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Further, to your plea for alternatives to PFSense.

225
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I ran a Linux-based firewall in our enterprise for years, from IPCOP to SmoothWall, even

226
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Firewall Builder to just straight-up IP tables.

227
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The grow your own options became troublesome to administer, and the Linux firewall distros

228
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
several years ago all seemed to go to a commercial model with community versions lacking in features

229
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
or maybe even no updates.

230
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I think your request for a Linux-based box is a bit misguided.

231
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You need to find the right application for the job, irrespective of the hardware or OS

232
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
it is sitting on.

233
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You shouldn't need to go tweaking at the command line with every function that's available

234
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
in the GUI and with validated sense checking.

235
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
In fact, tweaking on the command line in a firewall distribution could potentially compromise

236
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
the security of the firewall and cause problems with upgrades.

237
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
To that end, does it matter if it's running Linux or BSD if you never interact directly

238
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
with the OS?

239
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So long as it's open, stop searching for the holy grail when you have found it in PFSense.

240
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
We have numerous support staff who don't do Linux command line stuff, so a GUI was imperative.

241
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Switch to PFSense at version 1.21 and are currently running version 2.15 in 30 offices

242
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
dotted around the world.

243
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It has every feature I need and runs on a very modest hardware.

244
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
We run with HA failover, a pair of 8-nit boxes to each site on a modest, fanless,

245
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Atom SSD-based hardware.

246
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Keep up the great work, Gordon.

247
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So, I wanted to ask you guys, what do you think about Gordon's take here?

248
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Gordon's take is, use the right tool for the job, and if in that case it's a BSD box,

249
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
then you should just buckle down and use BSD.

250
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And here's where I come at it from.

251
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It seems like this is something that Linux should be very good at, but it's just we haven't

252
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
found the right combination yet of it.

253
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And it seems like as the host of the Linux action show, I should try to use something

254
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
that is Linux-based.

255
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So, but then I'm up against the realities that I have a corporate firewall that I need

256
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
to set up, and I have certain features that I need, and I have restraints like I need

257
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
to have people who are not Linux admins administer it.

258
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So, Matt, what do you think I do in this case?

259
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
So, from my perspective, at first when he said, you know, use the right tool for the

260
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
job, I was like, oh, that's the easy way out.

261
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
But then I'm thinking about it, and it's like, you know, if it's truly something that you're

262
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
going to just be front-facing, you're not going to be tweaking or having to do a lot

263
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
of massaging at any technical level, I can see where he's coming from on that.

264
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
That's fair.

265
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
If you just want something you plug, play, and forget about, okay, because there are

266
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
tools that we may use in the studio that may not necessarily be the most Linux-specific

267
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
in the world.

268
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I mean, that's life.

269
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
The camera may not run Linux.

270
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I mean, there's a lot of things that may, you know, the air conditioner, whatever.

271
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
There are certain tools we use that may not fall into that philosophy.

272
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
If that's one of those tools, I don't necessarily see that as a huge issue.

273
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It doesn't mean you can't explore the Linux options.

274
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But at the end of the day, if they're not meeting the need, then, hey, use what you

275
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
got to use.

276
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
So, Wimpy, you went through the same evaluation.

277
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You ended up going PFSense?

278
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yeah.

279
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Yeah, for work.

280
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:27,000
We tested just about every firewall distribution going, regardless of whether it was Linux

281
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
or BSD-based.

282
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:35,000
And PFSense is head and shoulders better than anything else that's out there that isn't

283
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
like, you know, a commercial proprietary offering.

284
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Heavens.

285
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
All right.

286
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
What's your take?

287
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Well, this time, I do agree with you.

288
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
This time, PFSense at this moment would most likely be the better firewall.

289
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
But I think it's bullshit that our Linux environment doesn't give us a firewall just as kick-ass

290
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
as PFSense.

291
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
More so.

292
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
But it's good at calling them all off.

293
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's good at calling them out and saying, come on, guys, we can do this.

294
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Why the hell are we going to wait for the PFSense guys to kick our ass all over the

295
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
place?

296
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
So, Webby Wizard, you want to make the case for IPFire.

297
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm not sure if it's an equivalent to PFSense, but I'd like to hear your take on it.

298
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So, it isn't an equivalent to PFSense in everything that it does.

299
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
But it does do quite a bit.

300
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And if you are willing to go and set up the couple rules that you might need to set up

301
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
that are a little bit extravagant, then you can do almost anything else.

302
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Like, the GUI has been changing.

303
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Extreme.

304
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Like, it's changed again.

305
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's changed the last three revisions.

306
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And it keeps on changing.

307
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And there's more and more features there.

308
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So, it's on the way.

309
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's just it takes a while.

310
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Mostly because a lot of the people that develop it are in German.

311
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
So, it takes a while for things to get pushed to English and other languages.

312
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
But it's working that way.

313
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And Colonel Linux, do you think that the Linux community has been friend-zoned?

314
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Because we know that there's high-end enterprise equipment that runs Linux that does this.

315
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Yeah, I don't know if it's a friend zone so much as just that there's clearly there's

316
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
a market in the very high end, right?

317
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And when I say that, I'm thinking of Cumulus Networks.

318
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You know, we interviewed them and clearly that's replacing the very, very high-end thing.

319
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And I mean, if you have $15,000, then you can get a Linux distro that supports it.

320
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
That's very open, mind you, that you could do your routing stuff and firewall stuff on.

321
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Right.

322
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
But I think probably the reason is because there hasn't been a real need.

323
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I don't you know, you were just talking about essential or maybe the other gentleman was

324
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
was mentioning, you know, we look at these things like appliances.

325
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
So if they're doing what we expect them to do, we don't really care what the underlying OS is.

326
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And it's not that Linux is incapable of it.

327
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's just that I don't know that there's been a huge demand.

328
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And of course, you know, you know, we do, you know, a lot of this stuff all the time.

329
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
And we've gone with Microtech, right?

330
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Because that's, you know, it essentially runs Linux on the underside.

331
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I can do all the administration from Linux.

332
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And as long as I'm not required to use Windows tools, I don't care.

333
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And those are probably make pretty good like if just firewalls for setting up like rules and filtering and things like that.

334
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,000
How do they do in terms of adding more advanced features like bandwidth monitoring, QOS, VPNs?

335
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, we have, you know, so in the hospitality industry, that's huge, right?

336
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
They want the if when the front, you know, you have the router set up and then the there has to be two essentially two networks.

337
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
One is the administrative network that runs the front desk and then one's the guest network.

338
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
But you don't want any one guest taking too much bandwidth.

339
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And if all the guests cumulatively are trying to consume a lot of bandwidth, you need to rein them in if the front desk needs to get some administrative tasks done.

340
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:44,000
So, I mean, yeah, you can set all that stuff up. And actually, one of the viewers of the show after you after you ran after when when I sent you one in and you talked about it.

341
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:52,000
He actually e-mailed me and said, I have five hotels or four hotels and I need them all connected with essentially like a VPN.

342
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I want to be able to get to all the computers. I want to put one router at each hotel and then I want them all connected so that, you know, essentially with a VPN.

343
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And he did that. So, yeah, it can they can do very advanced things.

344
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I haven't found anything that I could have done in a Cisco environment that I couldn't do with Microtech.

345
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But the same is probably true for PFSense. Well, the nice thing about the Microtech, right, is it comes with a hardware solution.

346
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,000
So you can get you can write it. You can get like almost it looks like a switch, but it's running the whole the whole OS.

347
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Well, and that's what drew me away from PFSense originally was if you want the rack, they sell hardware units.

348
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
But if you want the rack unit, you're looking at like fourteen hundred bucks with with Microtech.

349
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
They have they have one new rack unit starting at ninety nine dollars. So, you know, I was that just made more sense for us.

350
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Yeah. Yeah, really. Yeah. So like the RB201 or whatever is that right? Yeah. Yep.

351
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And so this would be a Linux firewall that I could drop in and it comes with like I assume like I could turn one of these ports into like a mirrored port if I wanted to.

352
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Is that a possibility? Yeah. There are five ports. You configure them however you want.

353
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,000
By default, it will come with port one set up as a LAN port and two, three, four and five set up as a bridge switch.

354
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
But you can you can break those back out and and and yeah, do configure it however you want.

355
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I know you sent me one. I just need to set it up because I need to what I really with the final decision factor for me would be the UI. Do you think that one you sent me is powerful enough to do what we do here at the studio?

356
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Absolutely. We will. The one I sent you is the same one that is kind of the stock one we put in the hotels.

357
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,000
The only difference between that one and the ones we put in hotels is that one's in a little plastic white box and the ones we install are in a rack box.

358
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
But it has the same processor, same memory. They're so tiny. That's that's a good thing.

359
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Yeah, yeah. And here's the thing. If if you and I, I strongly suspect you'll never be able to to to to saturate the that bus.

360
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:52,000
But if you were to saturate it and fill it up, the nice thing is when you go to the next model, you can take your config and drop it into the to the next one.

361
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
And because it's the same interface and the same OS, right? That's right. These are running router OS, right? Yes.

362
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's all coming back to me now. And if I was going to go to AltaSpeedStore.com, I would oh, I would get this page is not available.

363
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
But maybe that's where I would fix it. But that's where I would probably order something like this. Yeah.

364
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Very cool. If you decided you wanted a bigger one or a rack one, you let me know and one will show up.

365
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Well, if you say the one you send me is going to be able to hold hold the load, then I might just go that route because I've been really stuck with this.

366
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And will that one that you sent me also it'll do it has all the same features. It'll do a mirrored port and all that. Oh, that is so cool.

367
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:35,000
No, I think you just well, we'll see. We'll see if that's all. I've also gotten a couple of really good recommendations for a server.

368
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And a couple of them have been brought up in the in the chat room.

369
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,000
But there's a couple of people have sent in that I've heard about now that I didn't know of before I asked.

370
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
And I'm really appreciative of some of the suggestions I've gotten. So I've already gotten some great ones.

371
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So I'm definitely going to look at those two. Wimpy, did you have an experience with the Microtech routers?

372
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Yeah. So I've probably mentioned before that I'm connected to the Internet via shortwave radio.

373
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:13,000
And that's all running using Microtech routers this end and then power over Ethernet up the side of the house to an antenna and then a Microtech radio dish.

374
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:21,000
The beams across the countryside to a Microtech system on the other side and using QoS.

375
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,000
And so I guess you like them. I've got QoS profiled for the Mumble server so it doesn't get all patchy and crappy.

376
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
So they work really well and they're nice devices.

377
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Wimpy, it's like every time we bring something up, you manage to surprise me with something. That's great.

378
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
That's awesome. I mean, really. So there's a good endorsement right there.

379
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,000
All right. So we've got two more emails to get to. One's actually more of a PSA and then one is maybe we've got a great Mumble room today.

380
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
So maybe this is something you guys can help somebody solve. It's kind of in the networking category.

381
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
But first I want to mention Ting. Linux.ting.com is where you go.

382
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:00,000
That'll get you a $25 credit off your first month of Ting service if you've got a Ting compatible phone. They have a BYOD page.

383
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
However, if you're going to get a new phone like I did when I switched to Ting, well then they can give you $25 off your phone.

384
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:14,000
So I've done it. I've taken advantage of both offerings and I can tell you that either way it's a great deal because that's just the beginning and it's already in a tremendous value.

385
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Once you get your phone or you bring your phone over, then you have an incredible service with no BS because there's no contract.

386
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
There's no early termination fee. So they're not trying to get you that way and you only pay for what you actually use.

387
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Ting just takes your minutes, your messages, your megabytes and they just add them up.

388
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
So for three lines right now, in fact I will log into my account while I talk about this.

389
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:44,000
For three lines right now I am paying somewhere around $35 for an HTC One, a Nexus 5 and an iPhone 5 all on one Ting account.

390
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And what's awesome is I can go in and drill down and see which phone's using my bandwidth.

391
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I can set alerts individually for each line if I want to.

392
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I can also do things like manage the voicemail, the caller ID, name the phones, things like that.

393
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:03,000
So here, I'm pulling up my Ting account right now. So my current bill is $45. For three phones, $45.

394
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And you can see right now where our minutes and usage is at. It's really straightforward.

395
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
They use this fuel gauge system so you get a quick snapshot and get a great idea.

396
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Now that's based on my average, which is really cool. So Ting gives me my projected numbers as well as my current numbers.

397
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
So there's no hiding of information. It's just boom, right there. This is where you're at.

398
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Three lines. It's so great and so easy to manage. And they're always doing really cool stuff too.

399
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Like they just posted, we often talk about how Ting loves to do app picks.

400
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
We've gotten so many more recently. They've had different staff members.

401
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Like Andrew just picked his top six apps and posted them to the Ting blog.

402
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
So when you go to linux.ting.com, also check out their blog because even if you're not a Ting customer,

403
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
you could take advantage of some of these great app recommendations they have over on the blog.

404
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
So check out the Ting blog when you go to linux.ting.com as well because that's just one of many posts.

405
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
They've been doing a whole series of these app picks and they really do pick great ones. They work really hard on those.

406
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Ting also has no hold customer service. So if you get stuck or you move family over or you're part of a small business,

407
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
you've got staff that has a problem, you're not going to have anybody wasting time.

408
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,000
They just call 1-855-TING-FTW and a real human answers the phone between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. business hours.

409
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Easy peasy, right? So for me, I've never actually taken advantage of that as awesome as it is

410
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
because they also have an incredible online help system with a very active community.

411
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Like seriously, how many cell phone providers do you know?

412
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Like, hey, so I'm trying to get Ubuntu Touch working on my Nexus 5 and I'm having problems sending picture messages.

413
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Oh, well you can't do that. Oh, okay. Somebody else has tried this. Yeah, I just tried that. That is great. Thank you.

414
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Like just even the back and forth. Or yeah, do this or add this MMS server address or whatever it was.

415
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Like I never had to do any of that kind of stuff. I've actually had other problems like with Sailfish OS.

416
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Actually, Ubuntu Touch hasn't been a problem at all. But on Sailfish OS, I was able to go in there,

417
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I was able to find somebody else using Sailfish OS on Ting and Ting just allows the open conversations

418
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
and they watch that and they go, well, you know, sometimes they've extracted stuff from that and said,

419
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
you know, the community is really interested in this. Let's roll this out. And they've done that.

420
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It's really awesome. There's so many great things to check out. So start by going to linux.ting.com.

421
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Try out their savings calculator. Put your actual usage in there and then see how much you'd save.

422
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Oh yeah, and they're also on Reddit too. They're really savvy about that.

423
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Like there's a reddit.com.r.ting you can check out as well. That's pretty neat as well.

424
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
linux.ting.com and a big thanks to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

425
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Ting, you're so awesome. You're so awesome. Can you believe that? Three lines.

426
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
And I got to tell you, one of the people, one of those lines is talking all the time.

427
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
They're talking all the time. Not me. It's not me, but somebody else. No, no.

428
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
linux.ting.com, a big thanks to Ting.

429
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Alright, so let's see if we can help somebody with an interesting networking conundrum.

430
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
And really what that means is let's help somebody avoid their IT department.

431
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
So Eric writes in, A-R-I-C, Eric? He says,

432
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Hey guys, I'm running into an issue at work and I'm hoping you might be able to help me with this.

433
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,000
My laptop is running Mint 17. The Ethernet jack on my laptop connects to our corporate network.

434
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Ultimately that means my internet activity also goes through the corporate network, which means I hit their filter,

435
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
they block out lots of things and resources I need.

436
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:12,000
So what I do is I connect my Wi-Fi to a wireless network that just bypasses all the filtering and I can get out.

437
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Now of course that's always how it works. People always find a way.

438
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I know in Windows you can order the network interfaces so Wi-Fi would be above your local area connection,

439
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
meaning your traffic would go out that first and then go out the LAN connection if it couldn't find what it needs.

440
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
The only way I have found to do that in Linux is to hard set static routes.

441
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Do you know of any way in Linux to set your Wi-Fi adapter as the default adapter so I can stop disabling my LAN connection?

442
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Because that's sort of the route he started taking.

443
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Between last Linux unplugged and tech snap you guys pretty much fill up my morning and evening commutes.

444
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Looking forward to the next show, Eric.

445
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
So I was going to say default routes until he said I don't want to do routes.

446
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Anybody in the mumble room have a suggestion of a way he could manage this?

447
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Does network manager allow you to sort the preference order?

448
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Because I'm always usually just on one connection so I don't think I've run into this very much.

449
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Anybody have any suggestions?

450
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Wow.

451
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Nuts coming to my mind.

452
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
We've got like 25 people in this mumble room and nobody's...

453
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Wow.

454
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
If the network manager can't take care of it then it's like what do you do?

455
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Because one thing about Linux Mint, especially the Cinnamon version, is it relies on network manager.

456
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Network manager is a dependency.

457
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
My only suggestion would just use a VPN.

458
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Hmm.

459
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Or a proxy.

460
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Hmm.

461
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Yeah, a VPN might...

462
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Yeah, I just pipe all my stuff through a shuttle or SS shuttle.

463
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Yeah, I suppose a VPN would do that.

464
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
So in Windows you can set your network device preference order, right?

465
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I think that's what they call it.

466
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
You can set your device order.

467
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
There's got to be a way to do it in network manager.

468
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
VPN or...hmm.

469
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Yeah, I can't really think of another way.

470
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
There must be.

471
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Well, if anybody out in the audience, there might be somebody screaming at their headphones right now or monitors saying,

472
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I know a way.

473
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Go over to the linuxactionshow.reddit.com and find Linux Unplugged in the feedback thread and drop a note in there if you would.

474
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
What he could do is just use a different client altogether and just use Wicked or something.

475
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Right.

476
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
So this web browser goes here.

477
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Yeah, that might work.

478
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Yeah, that might be a way to do it.

479
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Or the other thing I was thinking is a VM, right?

480
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And have the VM attached to just the Wi-Fi and then just do all your browsing in the VM.

481
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And that also kind of gives you an extra layer of protection from somebody snooping through your machine and looking at your history.

482
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Yeah, that's easier to do in a virtual box.

483
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Yeah.

484
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Very easy.

485
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Right.

486
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Or even VMware Player or anything.

487
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
So that could be another way to go.

488
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
But I don't know.

489
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I don't know.

490
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
All right.

491
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
So then we just have a little PSA that producer Eric wanted to pass along to the troops out there.

492
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
There has been a security vulnerability discovered in apt.

493
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
The Google security team discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in the HTTP transport code in apt-get.

494
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:55,000
An attacker is able to do a man in the middle on an HTTP request so you could essentially snag somebody's apt-get request.

495
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Wow.

496
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:03,000
It can also trigger a binary buffer overflow leading to a crash on the HTTP apt method binary or potentially an arbitrary code execution.

497
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Two regressions have been fixed in an update that is out for Wheezy.

498
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
You can go get it.

499
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I assume this probably also affects Ubuntu.

500
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I don't know if it's been patched over there.

501
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
This has been known for a little bit.

502
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I meant to cover it on Sunday, but I totally skipped my mind.

503
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
But I know we have a bunch of Debian users out there.

504
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
So go get your updates, guys, because that one's a particularly nasty one.

505
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Yeah.

506
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
The big thing is that anything based on Debian is going to be affected by this easily.

507
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Right.

508
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,000
So as long as whatever distribution you've got patched it or what have you, then you're probably safe.

509
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Yeah.

510
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
We did have an email regarding systemd.

511
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And I have one more email to read.

512
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I don't want to just get all of our shows marred down in systemd discussion.

513
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
So I've just kept it to one email.

514
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And this one came in from system developer.

515
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
And he says, hello, Chris, Matt, and the chatroom.

516
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I just wanted to comment a bit on the whole systemd thing from a perspective of a low end or I'm sorry, a low level programmer.

517
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:07,000
If no one takes anything else from this email, please at least understand that modern software does not work the Unix way for technical reasons.

518
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Let's be realistic.

519
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Systemd init was a bunch of shell scripts that had very little in them to accommodate in terms of security, maintainability on a large scale.

520
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Testability and integration as well.

521
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,000
The reason systemd stores log files in binary format, for example, is for efficiency reasons when communicating between its different components.

522
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Not to make it impossible for you as the user to read them.

523
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
In fact, it's very easy to get your logs in text form.

524
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Another thing is the reason systemd integrates some of the stuff that we were previously separate as separate programs is it can integrate better with them,

525
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
i.e. communicating than communicating between shell scripts.

526
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
He says, when was the last time you saw a really good shell script of any complexity whatsoever?

527
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Yeah, I can't remember one either.

528
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Another thing is that exploiting concurrency and parallelism using shell scripts is practically impossible.

529
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I'm not even talking about having a nice API, et cetera, et cetera, which systemd also has.

530
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Let's not forget, Unix was built in an age where the internet was simply not a thing and so security concerns were often tossed aside.

531
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
It was built in an age of archaic hardware that certainly wasn't a quad six or eight core beast,

532
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
and it was built in an age when deploying your own personal VPS in 55 seconds wasn't possible.

533
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,000
It certainly is disgusting to hear all the trash talk from the BSD guys who until recently used an archaic compiler,

534
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
still use code from 1992, and use an init system that is a bunch of shell scripts.

535
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Go on, develop something systemd competitive and then talk. Let the code speak for itself.

536
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Some big words.

537
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Yeah, and I wanted to read that last part again where he says go on and develop something systemd competitive and then talk.

538
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:45,000
In light of our conversation on Sunday's Linux action show about uselessd or uselessd,

539
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I wasn't super happy with, I got all caught up in their attitude about it because I really hate the,

540
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I hate the we never needed this attitude about it because it seems so uninformed,

541
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:07,000
and I get really upset when people come with a technical argument that to me doesn't hold up,

542
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
but yet it still manages for some reason to gain traction in a technical crowd.

543
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Exactly.

544
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
That's very frustrating for me, and that's what I was getting worked up about on Sunday.

545
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I don't mind the idea of uselessd or uselessd.

546
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I think bring the competition. I think it's a little bit of shit competition.

547
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
It's based on a super old version of systemd, which is majorly disappointing,

548
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
which already there makes it feel a little uncompetitive,

549
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
and I think it's a little bit of shit at the language they're using, so I'm not super stoked about that,

550
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:45,000
but I do like the idea of a compatible competitive product that could at least offer some folks an alternative to systemd

551
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:54,000
while still maintaining some compatibility with systemd, so I'm all up for that, and I wish, I don't know,

552
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I just wish they could have gone about it differently, and I wish I didn't react so strongly on Sunday, I guess.

553
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Well, I think part of the problem is that with any technical argument, and this isn't just Linux,

554
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
this is just technology in general, it's like this is good enough for me if you can't figure it out

555
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
or if you can't make it work, you're an idiot or you're an a-hole or you're whatever,

556
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
and I see that amongst all platforms, all technologies.

557
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I see it from mechanics, I see it from people in the medical field, I see it across all things.

558
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I've seen it from painters. It's funny because we dig ourselves in here.

559
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Go to a cooking class sometime and you'll experience this. It's unbelievable.

560
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:36,000
So I think we as human beings need to get off our high horse, realize we're not as special as everybody told us we were,

561
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
and sometimes things that work for us may not, wait for it, work for everybody.

562
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
That's kind of my thing.

563
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Wimpy, I wanted to let you go first in the mumble room because I know you kind of had the first responses.

564
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
What are your thoughts on this all?

565
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Yeah, pretty much the same as yours, really. It's all a bit disappointing.

566
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,000
The only thing that I kind of agree, it's more positive than some of these negative responses

567
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
in that something's being created as a result of it.

568
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
So I do get frustrated when you hear people complaining and moaning about things,

569
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
but then they don't move on to something better or something that suits them better or find an alternative.

570
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
They just troll the community and whine and moan.

571
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,000
So useless D or useless D, whatever it is, at least they've created something which is positive,

572
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
but I'm not a fan of the language in the way that they're presented.

573
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Yeah, it's very trollish in and of itself.

574
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Pobi, are you present here? Are you here today?

575
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Because I'd like to get your take. So you've watched this from the Ubuntu side of the fence

576
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,000
where things have come out and then there's unending agony over it for months and months and months at a time

577
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
and it feels like it'll never go away.

578
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
You're sitting back here watching this, running a desktop probably powered by Upstart right now.

579
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
What are your thoughts on all of this?

580
00:33:52,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I don't care. Honestly, I don't care. It's plumbing and I don't particularly care about plumbing.

581
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I care more about the upper level of the stack and I like the fact that the system may start faster with system D

582
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:21,000
or it may be more reliable or it may be that people are able to build better startup scripts and shutdown scripts.

583
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
That all sounds amazing, but it doesn't sound particularly interesting to me.

584
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
And I find it tiresome that this is still going on.

585
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Yeah, and I think this has also been part of my reaction is that I'm honestly surprised that people care this much still.

586
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:45,000
No, actually, I think this cannot be resolved. Some people butt heads so hard that they will never agree.

587
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Because you think this goes down to fundamental lines?

588
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Yeah, they've already decided that they don't like it and they're not going to accept it.

589
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,000
There's no way we can actually convince them otherwise because they are stuck in a rut.

590
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
They will not move. They're zombified or petrified. They cannot progress.

591
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
But I think that fair enough to say there could be people on both sides of the debate.

592
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
There's people who will not move away from system D as the future too.

593
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,000
So it's not just one camp over the other. It just seems to be like Matt saying, people are just not really...

594
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
We have to agree to disagree.

595
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:27,000
But isn't system D the future actually? I mean, ever since Debian adopted it, how are you going to get away from it?

596
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I've had the same argument where people argue about mixers. It's like, oh, I use a KitchenAid.

597
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
It's like, oh, you sell out. You don't use the hand mixer.

598
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Yeah, or the barbecues. You get that in barbecues a lot too.

599
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Barbecues, big time. Propane, charcoal. These guys have fist fights over this stuff.

600
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
It's like, where does it end?

601
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
My name is Hank Hill and we sell propane and propane accessories.

602
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Hold on. Wimpy's got some math here. What do you have here, Wimpy? What are you linking to?

603
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Because it got blocked by the sensor in the chat room.

604
00:35:53,000 --> 00:36:00,000
It was a presentation that was given earlier in the year and one of the slides simply read,

605
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
the amount of energy necessary to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than to produce it.

606
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
And I just think that's where we are with this system D debate.

607
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Absolutely.

608
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Wow. Wow. Okay.

609
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
That's awesome.

610
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
All right. So the debate itself is not over. Our coverage itself is not over.

611
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I'm just trying to, I honestly want to give it some air. I don't know. We'll see.

612
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I mean, honestly, we are subject to the whims of what happens and what develops.

613
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
But for right now, I think the best thing is to let it get some air.

614
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Let everybody kind of think about it and then we'll address it again down the road.

615
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
We'll see if that actually, that's my intent. We'll see if that actually happens.

616
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I don't know. I'm trying. I honestly am trying.

617
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
All right. Before we get into one of our first big topics this week,

618
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I want to thank DigitalOcean.

619
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:47,000
DigitalOcean rocks. Simple cloud hosting dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way for you to spin up a cloud server.

620
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
In fact, now I'm not going to put words in your mouth.

621
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I don't want to set expectations upon you and make you think I'm going to judge you.

622
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
But you might be able to go create a cloud server in less than about, oh, I don't know, 35 seconds.

623
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
We'll see what you can do.

624
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Most users get a cloud server spun up in about 55 seconds.

625
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Some pricing plans start at only $5 per month for 512 megabytes of RAM,

626
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU, and a terabyte of transfer.

627
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
A terabyte. You know I get a terabyte, which is awesome,

628
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,000
which means when I have one of the number one reasons I have my BitTorrent sync server up on a droplet instead of anywhere else

629
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,000
is because I know that I have a terabyte I can burn a BitTorrent sync before I even need to care.

630
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,000
And DigitalOcean's pricing structure is so simple that if I wanted to bump up to the next bandwidth level, I could do it.

631
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
It's really crazy great.

632
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
And part of that is because their control panel.

633
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Their control panel is so simple and intuitive.

634
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
And power users can replicate that control panel on a much larger scale using their API.

635
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,000
It's pretty great because you're already seeing a bunch of apps come out from the community to manage your droplets.

636
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
And of course DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, and London.

637
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Go check them out.

638
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
That interface is so awesome.

639
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
And really their support is fantastic as well.

640
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I've gotten a number of really great stories from you out in the audience who've had some really good experiences.

641
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
When you go over to DigitalOcean.com, you can get a $10 credit.

642
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
You can try out a droplet for two months for absolutely free.

643
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
When you use the promo code, unplug September.

644
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
All one word, lowercase.

645
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Unplug September will give you a $10 credit.

646
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Try out the $5 rig.

647
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Get it for two months.

648
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Or go fancy.

649
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
And one of the cool things you can do over at DigitalOcean is you can sort of pre-charge the funding on your account if you want.

650
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
So this is a really nice way to just go in there, toss that in and get a $10 credit and run it for as long as you need it.

651
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Because you can also use their hourly pricing, which is super cool.

652
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
DigitalOcean.com, promo code, unplug September when you check out.

653
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
And a huge thank you to DigitalOcean for rocking so hard and their support of Linux Unplugged.

654
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Love it.

655
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I'm a droplet fiend.

656
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
It's cool, Matt.

657
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
It's cool.

658
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I admit it.

659
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I have a droplet problem.

660
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Oh, I keep popping them up.

661
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
It's like the way I go through Cokes in studio is like me with droplets.

662
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I'm just like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

663
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I'm telling you.

664
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Okay, cool.

665
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I like that.

666
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
That's a good analogy I can understand.

667
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
All right.

668
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,000
So let's talk about how Red Hat is going to take a machete knife to the throat of Canonical.

669
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I mean, no, I'm kidding.

670
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Wait, what?

671
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I'm kidding.

672
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I just like to make it sound more dramatic than it really is.

673
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
In fact, if anything, I'm not so sure that is going to be the case.

674
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
But Red Hat CEO announces that they're going to shift to focus on cloud computing.

675
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Surprise, surprise, gasp, surprise.

676
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
We've got several articles in the show notes that cover the announcement.

677
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
But if you didn't hear, this is sort of Red Hat's logic.

678
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
They say this is from their blog.

679
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
The competition is fierce and companies will spend and will have several choices for their cloud needs.

680
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,000
But the prize is the chance to establish open source as the default for the next era

681
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:41,000
and to position Red Hat as the provider for choice for enterprises and the entire cloud infrastructure.

682
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
To get there, Red Hat will focus on three key offerings.

683
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
It's CloudForm's management platform, it's OpenShift platform as a service, and OpenStack.

684
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
However, it's JBoss middleware and storage solutions will also play a role

685
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
in helping Red Hat deliver as much infrastructure as it can.

686
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Red Hat's new cloud focus doesn't mean it will pay less attention to Linux.

687
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:09,000
It just, it realizes its greatest challenge lies ahead in the data center itself.

688
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
So that's a little dramatic, but that's essentially what they're saying.

689
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
And they say they have excellent reasons for seeing it this way.

690
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
With the rollout of Azure, you have Amazon's EC2,

691
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
which a lot of these will run Red Hat in some places.

692
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
It's a big market. It's a huge market and it seems to be a big profit center.

693
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:33,000
And my question to you, Matt, is were they not focused on the cloud before?

694
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And did they not get the idea of OpenStack and hosting and all of this?

695
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Like this sounds like it's just sort of reaffirming what they've already been doing,

696
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
but just putting a new marketing spin on it.

697
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I think you hit it with the latter part.

698
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I mean, and they're probably not even doing that on purpose,

699
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
but they're kind of, they're trying to remind people,

700
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Hey, we're still doing this stuff. You should check it out.

701
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I mean, at the end of the day, I think they're feeling the heat from the competition,

702
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
whether it be Ubuntu or others.

703
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
And I think they're trying to say, Hey, we're still a thing.

704
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
We're still wanting to grow. We're still a billion dollar company.

705
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Come take a look at us. Come see what we're doing.

706
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
But I do feel like that if they're not careful, they could end up treading water.

707
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:16,000
And it does feel like that they could potentially here probably 2015, 2016 end up at that point.

708
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Just call it a hunch.

709
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Hmm. All right, Daredevil. And you think it's anything more than a marketing strategy?

710
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I think it's a marketing strategy and they are trying to bring attention and setting a playing field

711
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,000
for them to present the new tools that they've been working on that have barely been talked about.

712
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Here's what I wonder though, but is it that or is it acknowledging,

713
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Hey, we missed the open stack boat a little bit and now we're kind of going to make good on that.

714
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
And we're saying publicly that that area where Canonical is kicking our ass

715
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
and the server infrastructure, we're going to go for that now.

716
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
That's essentially, isn't that what they're saying is this is a public statement to say, bring it on.

717
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I think it's preparing ground more than anything else because they have tools that they've been developing

718
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
and they've been working on for a while.

719
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
They're trying to bring them on.

720
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,000
But if you just bring them on, there's no reason for you to be paying attention or to care about Red Hat.

721
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,000
So they need to start making statements so people start looking at them and then suddenly they can see

722
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
the tools that they're talking about and say, Oh, this is why I go to Red Hat.

723
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
All right, Eric, what do you think?

724
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Well, let's not forget they are the number one Linux provider in the world.

725
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:35,000
And let's not also forget they have competition in the form of Microsoft, Amazon and Google.

726
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I'm thinking Microsoft in particular because Sasha Nadella, he used to be the head of their cloud infrastructure division.

727
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
And so Microsoft is making that a big focus.

728
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I think Red Hat's basically reacting to that and they're like, well, we've got to get in on this too

729
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
otherwise we're going to miss the boat entirely.

730
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
And to that point, when you spin up an Azure server, are you getting Red Hat Enterprise Linux?

731
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Is that running on a Windows box?

732
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Is Red Hat Enterprise critical to that infrastructure or is it simply a feature of that infrastructure?

733
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
And does that sort of scare Red Hat a little bit?

734
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:14,000
And also, like you said, Sasha Nadella came from the Azure side and that seems like Microsoft's only legitimate future expansion.

735
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
So, of course, that's going to be competitive.

736
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,000
And on EC2, Ubuntu, I believe, is the preferred distro that runs over them.

737
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I'm not sure if that's true or not, but I think it's pretty much the preferred distro on every cloud platform.

738
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Right, exactly. And this is a huge problem for Red Hat.

739
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Yeah, they're playing catch up. It's plain and simple.

740
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:40,000
And today, I don't know, to me, I'm just reading tea leaves here, folks, but today Canonical announced that Oracle and Canonical

741
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,000
will collaborate on supporting Oracle Linux on Ubuntu powered infrastructures and vice versa.

742
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:51,000
So, this is sort of them saying we're going to work together to collaborate on making a common open stack infrastructure

743
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:57,000
where you'll know you'll have cooperation with either Oracle or Canonical to run their various Linux size.

744
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Yeah, that means Oracle Linux is still a thing, of course, but Oracle is in a blog post.

745
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:08,000
It's important for us to provide choice and interoperability around open stack, i.e. something else besides Red Hat.

746
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Oracle and Canonical are committed to supplying interoperability by supporting Oracle Linux on Ubuntu open stack.

747
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Our goal is to continue to provide customers with the best in class products and solutions and great customer experience,

748
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,000
i.e. we're going to team up to help continue to push Red Hat out.

749
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
It's funny, when you hear companies talk about interoperability, often what they mean is,

750
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
we'll allow you to run something else on our platform and that's it, full stop.

751
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,000
So, Microsoft interoperability for Azure means you can run Ubuntu Linux on Azure.

752
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:48,000
And for Red Hat, that means you could run CentOS on Red Hat, whereas with the Oracle deal, it's bi-directional.

753
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
You can run Ubuntu on Oracle, you can run Oracle on Ubuntu.

754
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I guess what I'm not clear on is, how has Red Hat screwed this up?

755
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
This seems like they were...

756
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I don't think they have. They couldn't have. They have a file system called Ceph.

757
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
It's a distributed file system that's pretty much built for open stack usage,

758
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:10,000
or the other Apache clustering file system that they have to use in those cloud environments because normal file systems don't work.

759
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Right.

760
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:16,000
They have their own file system built for it and that's what everyone uses and it's XFS based, of course.

761
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
But here's my question, is Oracle Linux still based on RAIL?

762
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Yeah, that's the funny thing.

763
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I think so, yeah.

764
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Yeah, they're poisoning the well which they're drawing from, yes.

765
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Exactly.

766
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
You know when conferences and all that stuff happen?

767
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,000
For the block layer, all the storage stuff, I always hear that Red Hat is still the biggest.

768
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
It has no competition in the server space.

769
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Right, right.

770
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
But I guess they're kind of worried about the cloud market.

771
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Well, I think they're dominating a lot of large on-premises installations and a lot of large hosting, a lot of large co-host stuff.

772
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:53,000
But I think where they're not dominating is this infrastructure on demand, I'm going to go spin up something in a few seconds and deploy it to thousands of endpoints.

773
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I don't think they're as competitive there and they are definitely building tools.

774
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
They need to sound more sexy again.

775
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
They need to sound more sexy again and be like, we're Ubuntu awesome.

776
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Yeah, Canonical does have a kind of, we sound good, so it's good to have us and it is a selling point, Ubuntu ability.

777
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I would argue that Red Hat isn't the right match for the demands of that type of use case.

778
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
And the reason I say that is it's just a fact of the matter.

779
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,000
In my opinion, and the only reason I say this is because I've literally set up hundreds of them,

780
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:32,000
but it is significantly less work to spin up an Ubuntu LTS server than it is a Red Hat server when you're doing certain tasks.

781
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
And that's if you use task cell and that's if you're more comfortable with apt than RPM.

782
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:42,000
I grant you those things, but if you accept those conditions, it is faster to set up an Ubuntu LTS system.

783
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
That plays into this.

784
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
That is a factor because I can tell you here at the Jupiter Broadcasting Studios,

785
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I don't particularly have one bias to the other, but when we need to spin up a VPS,

786
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I sure as shit don't spin up a CentOS one, I spin up an Ubuntu LTS one every single time.

787
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Oh yeah, that's not really where the benefit of Red Hat comes in.

788
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Where the benefit of Red Hat comes in is their support.

789
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
You can sue them and they give you custom patches for kernels.

790
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,000
If you have a bug in your company and only you're ever having that problem,

791
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:19,000
they'll give you a specific custom kernel patch for your problem to make you be operational.

792
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,000
And they'll work with hardware providers and they supply amazing enterprise tools,

793
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,000
but I don't think any of those strengths necessarily play into infrastructure on demand as much.

794
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Not that they're not a player there and not that they're not making changes with Fedora Server and Fedora Cloud,

795
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,000
all that's granted, but I'm just saying that the current conditions on the ground is,

796
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
there's just certain things stacked against the way you do things on Red Hat, I think.

797
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Well, I think it's admirable that they have the skills to be able to deliver a custom kernel patch

798
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
for some weird esoteric hardware they're running.

799
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
In the cloud, that doesn't matter. That doesn't matter in the cloud.

800
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:02,000
It's the same virtual machine. It's a QEMU. It's the same piece of hardware that every Linux distro is running under.

801
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,000
And the patches for one vendor will be provided by Microsoft.

802
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,000
The patches for another vendor will be provided by someone else, Amazon or OpenStack or whoever.

803
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,000
And while I think that's an admirable thing they have, I don't think it benefits them in the cloud.

804
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Good point. All right. So I want to give some other folks a chance to jump in here.

805
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Skyler, you say you kind of have an opinion on what Red Hat's core problem is?

806
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Well, it seems to me that, at least when the younger people think, the younger Linux people think of Red Hat,

807
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,000
we think of this old, the first program, something that everyone uses on the server.

808
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:46,000
But it's not new. It's not popular. It's just this company that started when Linux first existed,

809
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:52,000
and now it's here. It exists because it's been forever.

810
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:57,000
And it doesn't have that sort of appeal that I think a lot of people started playing with Ubuntu on the cloud

811
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
because that's what they played with on their desktop.

812
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
So it's the new hotness.

813
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Well, it was just what they were playing with at the time when this came around.

814
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:13,000
When I think of Red Hat, I think corporate. I think Heaven's Revenge hit the nail right on the head.

815
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I mean, yeah, sure, they'll come out with a crazy kernel patch for whatever esoteric hardware you have.

816
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
If you're a company and you have support content, blah, blah, blah.

817
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I could never get into Red Hat by virtue of that fact.

818
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Yeah, Red Hat's not for the common man. It's kind of where you have your balls are in a vice

819
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:33,000
and you're going to get your job fired unless you can actually get this fixed.

820
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
That should be part of a new commercial for them.

821
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Are your balls in a vice?

822
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Balls in a vice.

823
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
All right, so Silver Axe, I wanted to give you a chance to respond to.

824
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
It's about needing to spin up these on-demand servers.

825
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,000
You think maybe it's more about what runs those servers?

826
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
That was your go. No? Okay, all right.

827
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Well, then I'll move on to the next one.

828
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Webby, I wanted to give you a chance to chime in too because I know you picked me. Go ahead.

829
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Yeah, it was just a lot of the times, especially when you're dealing with management,

830
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
you're going and you're looking at them and you're saying, you're trying to say,

831
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,000
oh, we should go for this Ubuntu cloud thing and this is going to help us do this or that.

832
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:15,000
And it's very hard to sell them on something when you just sold them on a bunch of Red Hat boxes a couple months ago

833
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
and you're like, well, what's the difference here?

834
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,000
And it's like, so when you can already say, by the way, Red Hat is asking

835
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,000
and we have this extra platform on top of this and this will let us do this.

836
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,000
And it's just this little extra platform.

837
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Okay. All right.

838
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Wimpy, do you want any closing thoughts on this topic before we run?

839
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Yeah. So when Ubuntu started out, it was squarely aimed at the desktop market.

840
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:46,000
And although it had server operating systems, you know, bug number one was all about Microsoft

841
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,000
and I think that was fairly squarely aimed at the desktop.

842
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:57,000
And what happened with Ubuntu's rise in popularity is it attracted developers and administrators

843
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:02,000
and people got familiar with Ubuntu on the desktop and the skills that they learned

844
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
were then transferable to the server environment.

845
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:12,000
And I think this is one of the reasons why you see Ubuntu being so dominant now in the VPS and server space

846
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,000
because there's now a generation of developers who've grown up with Ubuntu, who've got the skills

847
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
and that is their go-to platform.

848
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
And if you look at Red Hat, this isn't just about the cloud

849
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
because the other thing they're talking about is Fedora Next and their desktop

850
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
and making it a developer-friendly thing.

851
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,000
I think it's the Fedora Next desktop and this refocusing on cloud.

852
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
And it's those two things together that they're actually trying to go after canonical with

853
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
because they need to catch up on developer mindshare.

854
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Well, I think it's all good. I mean, I don't know if it's fair to say it's all canonical

855
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
but I think a lot of the restructuring is because of that.

856
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
And I think this big press release is a response to them.

857
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
And I don't know if it's too late, maybe not.

858
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:02,000
But it seems like these kinds of things, these types of technologies, they come in waves.

859
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
And if you miss the wave, then your best bet is to just try to catch the next wave.

860
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,000
And I think cheap on-demand servers hit around the same time

861
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
that people were really starting to experiment with Ubuntu on the desktop

862
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
and they just happened to nail that timing.

863
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
It's a part of the component.

864
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
And then canonical was smart enough to recognize that and respond.

865
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,000
And not to Red Hat's discredit because Red Hat continued to go off

866
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
and make billions doing their thing.

867
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
And now they've really locked that down.

868
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
And now I think they're looking back and going,

869
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
you know, we might have had a little bit of a blind spot

870
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
and now we're going to try to address that.

871
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
And I think that's completely respectable and exactly what you would expect them to do

872
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
and exactly what they should do.

873
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
The question is, can they actually truly really pull it off now?

874
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Or is it too late?

875
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,000
It'll be glacial in terms of the rate of change and adoption.

876
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I mean, yeah, of course they can pull it off.

877
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
They have the money.

878
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Well, and they can stick with it for a long, long time.

879
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Exactly.

880
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
That will be interesting to see.

881
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
We'll follow to see what happens.

882
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
I think this is going to be an interesting little rift

883
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,000
because this is some serious legitimate competition we're going to start seeing go down here.

884
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
And it doesn't have anything to do with phones.

885
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
It doesn't have anything to do with tablets.

886
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,000
It's straight up what makes great infrastructure, what makes great support,

887
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
and I believe it can bring out the best in these companies.

888
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
So as observers, I think we're going to be in for quite a show.

889
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
So we'll see what happens.

890
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:27,000
We've got one more thing I want to get into, and that is the sad state of XFCE

891
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
and what the Debian project has done about it.

892
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
But before we do that, I want to thank Linux Academy.

893
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
In fact, I'd love to have you head over to Linux Academy right now.

894
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,000
In fact, if you go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, you'll get the 33% discount.

895
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:44,000
And let me tell you, Linux Academy has just rolled out a ton of upgrades.

896
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
And if you're a Linux Academy subscriber, you get them automatically.

897
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:51,000
And if you haven't been one yet, well, then go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and sign up.

898
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
So Linux Academy is a great resource.

899
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
If you want to learn the backend infrastructure of Linux,

900
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:01,000
if you want to learn certain things like the software stack, like perhaps maybe Apache, PHP, and MySQL,

901
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
or R-Sync and things like that, or OpenStack even,

902
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
or if you want to go down even lower to the networking and stuff like that,

903
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Linux Academy can accommodate all of that.

904
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
They have step-by-step video courses.

905
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
They have downloadable comprehensive study guides.

906
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
They have 7-plus Linux distributions you can choose from,

907
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
and then they'll automatically adjust the course where they have on-demand servers.

908
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,000
So as the course requires, they'll spin up a virtual server or an AWS instance in the background for you.

909
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
And they've just rolled out a ton of new things.

910
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
But I think I'm going to talk about learning plans today.

911
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Because if you're busy, like I am, this is particularly appealing.

912
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
And it's super, super smart.

913
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:38,000
And it's such a great way where I can continue to put that carrot in front of me to push myself forward,

914
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
to learn more, to better myself, but not get burned out and frustrated because I'm too busy.

915
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
They're called learning plans.

916
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
And based on the information that Linux Academy has rolled out to all subscribers,

917
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
learning plans allow the user to select their daily availability.

918
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,000
And based on that availability, a study plan is automatically created.

919
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Learning plans will give you the lessons, the quizzes, and the virtual labs that are due on each day.

920
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,000
And I'll even send you an email reminder if you need it to remind you what's due for that day.

921
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,000
And based on the availability that you set, it will even give you a projected completion date of the course

922
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
with extra time included for studying.

923
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
I think learning plans is awesome.

924
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
And they've got some great ones for CentOS.

925
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
So we're talking about Red Hat, OpenStack.

926
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
We've been talking about that today.

927
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
They have 14 upcoming courses throughout the remainder of the year, too.

928
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
And I'll tell you more about those as they get closer.

929
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Their dashboard lets you pick up right where you left off, gives you estimations of time on each part.

930
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
They have a community that can be there for support when you need it.

931
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:36,000
And they're doing live sessions with the educators more and more so you can ask questions directly to them.

932
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
It's a group of Linux users and educators who got together and said,

933
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
we can serve the Linux community better.

934
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
And now they're doing it.

935
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
They've created something for Linux users, and it's awesome.

936
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged.

937
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Go check them out.

938
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
They just got better than ever, too.

939
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,000
And a big thanks to Linux Academy for their great support of Linux Unplugged.

940
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I think it's a really good resource.

941
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
You guys can check it out.

942
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Even if you're a pro, go refresh your skillset.

943
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,000
I think you'll be pretty impressed with the little details you can fill in.

944
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Okay.

945
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,000
So today, or was it today or recently, really recently,

946
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Debian announced that they're going to switch back to GNOME after what was it?

947
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Guys, what was it?

948
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Ten months ago they said they're going to switch to XFCE, or was it even less than that?

949
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
It was less than that.

950
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
I think it was 10 or 11.

951
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Okay.

952
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
This is hilarious.

953
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
So not too surprising, right?

954
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
I mean, so here's what they said.

955
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
According to a Debian developer who is performing this change,

956
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:35,000
the main reasons for Debian switching back to GNOME from XFCE are accessibility options in GNOME and system deintegration.

957
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
So I think that's pretty interesting.

958
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
It's exactly what I wanted to see.

959
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Derek Devlin, do you think the Debian users are going to respond well to this?

960
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Do you think this is good feedback, that this is something people are going to like?

961
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Yes, and they have the Debian contest, which they use heavily to decide what is default on a Debian installation.

962
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,000
So as a Debian user, I am actually pretty happy with it.

963
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Well, okay.

964
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
But Wimpy, why not Matej?

965
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Well, during the evaluation that took place, Matej scored very highly on the evaluation score sheet.

966
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:16,000
In fact, coming in just behind GNOME and in fact scoring higher in one area

967
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:23,000
because Matej can support system D or console kit, which of course on Debian, system D isn't a hard requirement.

968
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Right, right, right.

969
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
So was it just because it was too new?

970
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
What was sort of the reason?

971
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Or did GNOME just win out in votes?

972
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
I think GNOME has got a larger group of maintainers behind it,

973
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
and there's more momentum behind that project in Debian at the moment.

974
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Matej is still very fresh.

975
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Those packages have only just arrived in the last sort of four or five months or so.

976
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
So the team is quite small.

977
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Just a dovetail on that, XFCE has hardly any development currently going on.

978
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Yeah, let me pick up from that point.

979
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
And I want to toss this to Rottencorps.

980
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Isn't this really what we are seeing here is the people,

981
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:06,000
the Debian community realizing that XFCE is a dead man walking, Rotten?

982
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Well, dogs are barking.

983
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Oh, all right.

984
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Well, Eric, I'll let you take that.

985
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Then what do you think, Eric?

986
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Is this a sign that people are waking up and saying, geez, maybe?

987
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
I mean, let's look at XFCE.

988
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Hey, what's XFCE's Wayland plan?

989
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
There is none.

990
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Oh, what's XFCE's system D plans?

991
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
There are none.

992
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Oh, right.

993
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I mean, mad respect from XFCE, right?

994
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Mad respect.

995
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:41,000
No, look, I've had low-end systems that XFCE has given me the option of feeling like I have a real boy desktop on a low-end system.

996
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
And I have mad respect for that.

997
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
But at the end of the day, Matej is here.

998
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
It's updated.

999
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
It's integrating new features.

1000
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
It has about the same resource requirements as XFCE.

1001
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:56,000
I'm looking at XFCE and I'm thinking, so long.

1002
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
And thanks for all the fish.

1003
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Yeah, no kidding.

1004
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
To me, XFCE just doesn't cut it in functionality.

1005
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Mate or Matej, it's built on all of Gnome 2.

1006
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Gnome 2 was in Debian stable for what, 14, 15 years beforehand?

1007
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:16,000
And so it's based on a really solid base, kind of like how X4 was built on the X3 code base.

1008
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
They got a solid base.

1009
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Okay.

1010
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
All right.

1011
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
So are you going to come to XFCE's defense here?

1012
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:29,000
So I'm not going to come directly to its defense, but you really should take it easy on them.

1013
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
There are a bunch of university students that are working on this.

1014
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:40,000
There's no people that are hired or there's no XFCE huge team where they have funding every single year for it.

1015
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Right.

1016
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,000
As opposed to the – and it's especially unfair comparing them to the Matej team who's rolling, right?

1017
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I mean, I believe they have, what, 25 developers who each make about a million a year working for them?

1018
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Exactly.

1019
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Oh, yeah.

1020
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Well, XFCE would be a rhythm of Gnome way back in the day.

1021
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,000
I mean, obviously, this is always a problem whenever you criticize open source.

1022
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:02,000
At the end of the day, it's guys and gals working on code in their free time a lot of the times.

1023
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
And like I said, I have massive respect for XFCE.

1024
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,000
In fact, it was a go-to desktop for me for a long time.

1025
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:14,000
But at the same time, you know, as users, we also have to say enough is enough.

1026
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Katie, you started that way and Gnome started off just as small.

1027
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Gnome 2 and X – or Katie 2 and 3 point whatever.

1028
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:27,000
If, you know, time comes and they should die or better things actually win out, then so be it.

1029
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
I totally agree with that.

1030
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:36,000
But like by the same token, like XFCE always seems to – you know, when things actually really need to be done, they seem to actually really do them.

1031
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
When I need to do something, I start off lost, man.

1032
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
What does that mean?

1033
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
When something needs to be done, they do it.

1034
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,000
They've released five times in ten years.

1035
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Yeah, but I mean like – but it still runs.

1036
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
It's still stable.

1037
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Because they've changed nothing.

1038
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I don't know.

1039
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
I can comment on that.

1040
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
I don't know if I would go with stable.

1041
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Wimpy, yeah, just take that.

1042
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Can I say something, please?

1043
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
All right, yes.

1044
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Go ahead, Fred.

1045
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Let Fred get in.

1046
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Let Fred get in.

1047
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
He's been waiting.

1048
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Sorry, Fred.

1049
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Okay, thanks.

1050
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:09,000
So first of all, if you look at their Git repository, you have about a whole bunch of commits in the past seven days.

1051
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:14,000
So they're still like all over – so over a bunch of modules.

1052
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Yeah, but what you need to do is then discount all the translations and then look at the actual activity.

1053
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:26,000
I mean, translations are still work, you know, that has to be done.

1054
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
They are, they are.

1055
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:35,000
But by comparison, there's work that needs to be done on things like Upower support, which hasn't been done.

1056
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Right.

1057
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,000
And as Rotten alluded to, there hasn't been a stable release for over two and a half years.

1058
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
So there's some real big rot in 4.10.

1059
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
But the more important thing –

1060
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
That's not necessarily a bad thing.

1061
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
So they are –

1062
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,000
No, it's the bad thing is that it happens every time.

1063
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
It's okay.

1064
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
It's okay.

1065
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Just give them time.

1066
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
They are underpowered.

1067
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Just give them time.

1068
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
I'm in the same campus, Fred.

1069
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:08,000
And by the way, KDE and GNOME, yeah, they have like great system D plans and they have like great Wayland plans and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah all day long.

1070
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Yeah, good plans.

1071
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:18,000
By the way, by the way, we're going to watch KDE and GNOME crash a hundred times a day on Wayland until things get better.

1072
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Absolutely.

1073
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
There is some truth in that.

1074
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:25,000
But Xfce is going to come later and they're going to look at the lessons learned.

1075
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:30,000
They're not going to make the same mistakes and they're going to take their time preparing it.

1076
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:36,000
But don't you feel like, don't you feel like if there was any distribution in the world that understood that logic, it would be Debian?

1077
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Because that's like Debian to a T and yet even for Debian, Xfce is too slow.

1078
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
FreeBSD as well.

1079
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Or FreeBSD, yeah?

1080
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Or the BSDs in general.

1081
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Also, I would like to point out that Xfce is like way, way, it's much more of a community project than GNOME as an example.

1082
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
GNOME and system D, by the way.

1083
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Right, right.

1084
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Yes, very good point.

1085
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:11,000
But that still doesn't take into effect the fact that every single release is never more – under a year from the last release.

1086
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
And most of the time they take even more than that.

1087
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
That one time they took three years and now they're almost at three years.

1088
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:27,000
And the fact that they even said they were going to release 4.12, which is the one that isn't out yet, they're going to release that in January of 2013 and they massively missed that goal.

1089
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:31,000
They missed every single goal they ever make.

1090
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Okay, just use your desktop and why do you have to care about releases?

1091
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Just use the applications.

1092
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
That's what it's there for.

1093
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Why do you care so much about the desktop?

1094
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Well, if I'm building a project that requires GTK3 and then they don't allow you to have GTK3 and then there's a bunch of people asking for an older version and for an older toolkit that no one's using anymore or should use but Xfce is completely dependent on, that's an issue.

1095
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,000
That's the wrong radical changes to underlying system components.

1096
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
This is just bad design from other people.

1097
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
It's not their fault.

1098
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:10,000
All right, let's take a pause here because I think we're kind of getting in the weeds and I want to give Wimpy a chance to chime in on a couple more issues and then we'll loop back.

1099
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
So go ahead, Wimpy.

1100
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I'd just like to answer Fred there about why does it matter?

1101
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Why do they need a new release?

1102
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:28,000
And if the underlying libraries and components weren't changing, you wouldn't need to make a new release of Xfce 4.10 because it's a stable desktop.

1103
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:41,000
But the fact is the underlying technologies are changing and they haven't had a stable release that keeps up with those changes, which means that now they're at a place where they can't support the underlying technologies.

1104
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:56,000
And for example, there was a uPower 0.99.1 transition proposed for Ubuntu 14.10 and that was effectively vetoed by the Ubuntu team because there's not sufficient support in Xfce for that.

1105
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,000
So it's been deferred until the next cycle.

1106
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:04,000
And we went through similar growing pains in Arch Linux with Xfce.

1107
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Wait, has that been deferred only because of Xfce?

1108
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Everyone else has plus one to accept Xfce.

1109
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Yeah, go and read it.

1110
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Yeah, the last few comments.

1111
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:19,000
And it potentially introduces a blocker on name three.

1112
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
I absolutely agree.

1113
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:26,000
They are underpowered and the underlying system components keep changing.

1114
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,000
For my taste, too quickly that it's becoming really annoying.

1115
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,000
But okay, they are underpowered and I absolutely agree with you.

1116
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
They sometimes have to keep up.

1117
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Yeah, they're not keeping up with the pace.

1118
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
But still, I mean, I'm sorry.

1119
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Today, GNOME 3, the great GNOME 3 that everybody is praising right now, just froze.

1120
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
It just froze out of nowhere.

1121
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Like the applications were still working, but the shell just stopped rendering.

1122
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:08,000
And I had to switch to TTY and kill GNOME shell and then restart it again and so on.

1123
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:13,000
And Xfce has never done anything like that to me.

1124
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
I'm sorry.

1125
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
You have to bear with that.

1126
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,000
That's been my experience.

1127
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Yeah, me too.

1128
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
All right.

1129
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Well, you know what?

1130
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
I think Pope is right.

1131
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
I mean, we can sit here and we can pitch.

1132
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,000
But one of the things we always talk about is we do have the advantage of actually helping.

1133
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:33,000
And I guess if Xfce is so important to people, then they should put their money where their mouth is

1134
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:39,000
and either contribute financially or contribute time-wise or even contribute just to promote the project.

1135
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
And maybe it has a shot.

1136
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:46,000
It seems like there's enough people here that give a crap that if people acted on that

1137
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,000
and maybe helped the project out, it could push through these challenges.

1138
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:53,000
It seems like right now Xfce is on the ropes, but it's not out.

1139
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
And there's still a legitimate use case for it and people who care about it.

1140
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:01,000
But there's also undeniably legitimate problems that could start affecting.

1141
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Actually, you know what?

1142
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Pope and Wimpy gave us a great example.

1143
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
It has already affected wider things in the Linux system.

1144
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,000
So obviously these are things that need to be taken care of.

1145
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:17,000
But I honestly see the way I look at it and I believe this is the overriding thing that we are facing

1146
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:23,000
is there are other alternatives out there that are just simply here today and working.

1147
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:28,000
And I would point to Matei and I would also point to the classic mode of GNOME,

1148
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,000
which will give you, if you don't have the hardware restrictions,

1149
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:37,000
a lot of that classical desktop feel from GNOME 2 and that solves the high-end issue.

1150
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:42,000
And Matei is solving the people who either want something even more classical or resource constrained.

1151
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,000
And those are two ends that Xfce is now going to have its lunch eaten from.

1152
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:51,000
And they are not only not keeping up to date with the needs of their end users,

1153
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
but they are also now lacking competitively.

1154
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:58,000
And we've all had the problem where icons rearrange in the top bar in Xfce when something happens

1155
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,000
or our dual displays don't work correctly for some reason.

1156
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,000
We've all had these problems in Xfce and they are kind of getting to the point where it's getting a little old.

1157
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:12,000
But what I'm walking away from this conversation is people give a hell of a lot more of a crap about it than I thought they did.

1158
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,000
And I think we should try to turn that around and actually make some positive action from it.

1159
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Yeah, if people want it, they need to step up, man up or woman up and help out.

1160
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
You know what, Wimpy, you're absolutely right.

1161
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Bring up, there's another bit of pressure on Xfce, isn't there?

1162
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Yeah, LXQT.

1163
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Right. Yeah, absolutely.

1164
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Yeah.

1165
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
That's really solid.

1166
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
There you go.

1167
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Yeah, that's another big, yeah, that's another thing that's...

1168
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
And I think, frankly, that's going to start putting pressure on some of...

1169
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
That's probably where I would go.

1170
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,000
I mean, you know, if they can't fund their stuff, that's, I don't...

1171
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:49,000
First of all, if your funding model sucks, that sucks to be you, I'm sorry.

1172
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Well, I don't know if it is that.

1173
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
I think it's just a matter of time and dedicated resources.

1174
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Or whatever the issue is.

1175
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
I mean, I'll just move to another desktop.

1176
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:01,000
I mean, I don't care, but I will tell you right now that, I mean, I have a gaming box that, while it's nothing to write home about, it does the job.

1177
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:06,000
But for me, it's always been such a waste of effort to run a bloated desktop.

1178
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
What's the point?

1179
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
What's the point?

1180
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
I hear that.

1181
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Why? Why would I?

1182
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Yeah, why waste resources?

1183
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
I'd rather put that RAM into my game or something.

1184
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Right, yeah.

1185
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
No, I hear that.

1186
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Yeah, I definitely hear that.

1187
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
That's why I just get ridiculous amounts of RAM.

1188
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Wow.

1189
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:26,000
I'm sat here like Spider-Man on my Unity machine, and I'm seeing all these people talking about...

1190
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Spider-Man.

1191
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
You went for Spider-Man.

1192
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Spider-Man memes.

1193
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Yeah, exactly.

1194
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
I like that.

1195
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
And I'm seeing all these options that people have.

1196
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
I mean, there are so many options.

1197
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:39,000
And that's, you know, this whole choice thing that, you know, we've often talked about.

1198
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Yeah, there's the bleeding edge Unity and Gnome Shell and then this new contender, LXQt.

1199
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:52,000
There's still, you know, we're 2014, and there's still loads of choice out there for people to pick something else.

1200
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,000
You know, if a project does wither and die, well, so be it, and, you know, move on to something else.

1201
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Ain't it grand.

1202
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Ain't it grand.

1203
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
And yet we still bitch about it.

1204
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Yeah, sure, right?

1205
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
That's what we do, right?

1206
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Yeah.

1207
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Well, I was just going to say one more thing.

1208
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Yeah.

1209
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Just, there is this new trend.

1210
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:14,000
And so I think at the beginning of the show, you said something about, you know, how system D parallelizes startup and all this stuff.

1211
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,000
And I was talking today with a colleague about that.

1212
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:24,000
And it seems like fancy, like lately, fancy seems to trump correctness.

1213
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
And I absolutely hate that.

1214
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:31,000
So XFCE is kind of the tried and true and working well.

1215
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Totally.

1216
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:43,000
It's still trying out stuff, you know, like a lot of people have had horrible experiences with KDE 5, and it keeps crashing and so on.

1217
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
They just didn't take their time.

1218
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,000
XFCE guys are underpowered, and they take their time.

1219
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,000
They're not going to make a release if they don't think it's ready.

1220
01:10:51,000 --> 01:11:01,000
It's very easy to be tried and true when you don't change the core content of your system for 11 years.

1221
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
It is really easy to be tried and true at that point.

1222
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Well, but that is something that does appeal to some people.

1223
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
All right.

1224
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Ron's got a horror story that we'll save for the post-show because I think that's going to be interesting.

1225
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,000
And I feel like we've covered it.

1226
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
And I think I've said my piece about it.

1227
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:22,000
And what I would like to say is, you know, try out, if you are struggling with XFCE, try out other options.

1228
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,000
And if it works for you, then just be happy with it.

1229
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:35,000
But for me, I think XFCE, I didn't even realize it, but I think I stopped installing it about a year ago.

1230
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:41,000
And mostly that's because there's just other options now, and it just depends on the distro I'm installing.

1231
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:46,000
And I'll either go with Mate or LXQT, and I kind of call it good.

1232
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
So I hope that's not the future.

1233
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:54,000
There's one other desktop out there as well that's slowly coming to Linux, and that's the Lumina desktop from the BSDs.

1234
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Yeah, another QT desktop.

1235
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Yeah, and very XFCE-like.

1236
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,000
I tried it out. Give me the file manager, and we don't need Lumina anymore.

1237
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:07,000
That's true. The file manager is super sweet, the way it integrates ZFS snapshots. That's really cool.

1238
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Yeah, that's the thing that'll bring to everyone else.

1239
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:13,000
BSD Now did an interview, or actually a walkthrough of the Lumina desktop.

1240
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:19,000
If you go to look at the BSD Now back catalog, because Chris Moore, creator of PCBSD and co-host of BSD Now,

1241
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
it's his brother that's making the desktop.

1242
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,000
So he just sat down with his brother, and they did a screencast, and they recorded a bunch of stuff.

1243
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:28,000
So if you're curious about the Lumina desktop, they've got, I think, two episodes on it now.

1244
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
So you can check that out.

1245
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,000
By the way, I'd like to advocate one more thing for XFCE.

1246
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Please, everybody, try the multiple file renamer from Thunar, the file manager.

1247
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Yeah, Thunar is awesome, actually.

1248
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:48,000
I always use the renamer for... I downloaded a lot of things with large playlists.

1249
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
That renamer was so very helpful.

1250
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Oh, wait a minute. What are you doing there?

1251
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:57,000
All right, well, we'll get Rotten Corpse's story in the post-show, but, Matt, that's going to wrap us up for today.

1252
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Man, we covered a lot of ground in this episode. Holy smokes!

1253
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
No kidding.

1254
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:06,000
I wonder if I will have a resolution to my firewall conundrum in Sunday's Linux action show.

1255
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
You never know, Matt. You never know.

1256
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Could happen.

1257
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,000
But I'll see you on Sunday, and hope you have a great rest of your weekend.

1258
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Happy post-birthday.

1259
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Oh, yeah, thanks.

1260
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
We're, like, sandwiched right in between it.

1261
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Like, you had your birthday in between last and Linux Unplugged.

1262
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
So, super low-key, had a great time.

1263
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Good. I'm glad to hear it. Well, happy birthday, and I'll see you on Sunday, Matt.

1264
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
See you then.

1265
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,000
All right, everyone. Well, thank you so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1266
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Don't forget, we do this show on Tuesdays over at jblive.tv, jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

1267
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,000
We'll have that in your local time zone.

1268
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,000
You can also go over to jupyterbroadcasting.com slash contact to send us your feedback.

1269
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
That's a huge part of our show.

1270
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,000
And the subreddit, linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

1271
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
An awesome place to go. We'll have a feedback thread.

1272
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
You can give us ideas if we want you.

1273
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:49,000
You know, maybe you had an XFCE rant, post it over there. We'll give it a read.

1274
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
All right, everyone. Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1275
01:13:52,000 --> 01:14:21,000
See you right back here next Tuesday.

1276
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:27,000
All right, we're out.

1277
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Okay, Rodden, why don't you share with us your horror story that happened?

1278
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Because I know you got all fired up about XFCE and you were just waiting to rip into him.

1279
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,000
And I didn't want to put that in the main show because I feel like I didn't want to be a bash on XFCE.

1280
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,000
But you obviously ran into something that got you all fired up.

1281
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Oh, did I? You had a good gun.

1282
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Did I?

1283
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
A little bit.

1284
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Oh, I didn't mean to.

1285
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
I didn't walk in.

1286
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Wow. Oh, well, okay. All right.

1287
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
I didn't actually think I was being that mean.

1288
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,000
There I go.

1289
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,000
I was definitely going to be mean because it essentially crashed my hard drive.

1290
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Now, how can that be? How could it crash your hard drive?

1291
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:03,000
You would think it's not a big deal, and I wouldn't have expected it to happen.

1292
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,000
That's why I didn't bother doing what I normally would have.

1293
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,000
I basically loaded up a live USB of Xubuntu.

1294
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:14,000
And then I mounted my main hard drive for my laptop.

1295
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,000
And then I forgot to unmount it before I turned off my computer.

1296
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Any other system I have ever done that in, nothing happens.

1297
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:26,000
But with XFCE or Xubuntu specifically, it crashed the hard drive completely.

1298
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000
It was unmountable.

1299
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,000
I had to just completely rescue it.

1300
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
No way. How can that be XFCE's fault, though?

1301
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Yeah.

1302
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
It sounds like a bad library somewhere or something.

1303
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Yeah.

1304
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:41,000
That's why when I put it in the chat room, that's why I said it was Xubuntu's fault because it was Xubuntu's fault.

1305
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Yeah, those bastards.

1306
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Yeah, you know what?

1307
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,000
To me, it sounds like a rogue library.

1308
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:50,000
You had a Cardassian in your Klingon mix or something. I don't know.

1309
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:58,000
I even did it with Ubuntu and Lubuntu before I tried the Xubuntu because I was just playing with some DEs and stuff.

1310
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
And none of them had a problem.

1311
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
The only one that had a problem was Ubuntu.

1312
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,000
So it's not an XFCE-specific thing, but it is definitely an Xubuntu-specific thing.

1313
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
No, I don't doubt that.

1314
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:16,000
It sounds like maybe that particular flavor had some sort of rogueness inside of it somewhere that maybe said, you know what, screw you.

1315
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Did you happen to download that ISO from FreeBSD.org?

1316
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:38,000
No.
