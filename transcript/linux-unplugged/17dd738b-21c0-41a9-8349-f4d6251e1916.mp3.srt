1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,960
a robot yes what are we going to do with a robot well astro follow me yeah who doesn't want an

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,240
amazon dog following you around your house for just over a thousand dollars their new

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,080
alexa on wheels has been announced today it probably runs linux but i don't know if it

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,640
even matters i don't care at this point if it runs linux or not i don't want a robot that

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,080
follows me in my home i have too many dogs as it is you do have a lot of dogs that's a good point

6
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,800
i would like them to just actually have a program that connects us to dogs how about that let's

7
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,280
just skip the whole robot thing save everybody money yeah quick short term you know prime delivery

8
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:58,080
dogs hello friends and welcome back to your weekly linux talk show my name is chris my name is wes

9
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:04,320
hello wes you're coming in looking great today i love that all purple outfit this episode is

10
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,040
brought to you by a cloud guru the leader in learning for the linux cloud and modern tech

11
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,720
skills hundreds of courses thousands of hands-on labs go get certified go get hired get learning

12
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,760
at a cloud guru.com well coming up on the show today it is time for our server crash post-mortem

13
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:28,400
it struck at the worst time possible and then it crashed again it's been quite the journey we have

14
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:36,400
talked about our server on the show a lot and this week the chapter is coming to an end i'm a

15
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,080
bit sad but also excited about where we're going we have a major update for you this week but we

16
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:48,080
will start out by telling you why our arch server crashed recently and then why it crashed again

17
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:54,000
even more recently that we haven't told you about and then what we're going to do to get things

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,200
right to do the right thing here and get going and what we had to do just for now we're going

19
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,280
to tell you all of it it's a full post-mortem today on the show and then we have at the end

20
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,200
a really kind of a fantastic surprise twist we'll tell you about some really big future plans and

21
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,360
on top of all that in case the server stuff isn't quite your bag we've got some nice thought

22
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:20,080
provoking community news some old friends stopping by the show and a lot more so there is as they say

23
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,200
a big show today so before we go any further let's say time-appropriate greetings to our

24
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:35,200
virtual lug hello mumble room hello hello hello that is a good-looking mumble room we got 18 of

25
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,680
you in there nice to see you mostly everybody in the on-air room rocking out with us today

26
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,120
so i want to start by asking the mumble room how they feel about a news story that i came across

27
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,960
just before the show started ferronics has noted that the first sign of linux support for what

28
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:59,040
intel is calling quote software defined silicon are now landing for linux michael writes there's

29
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,360
been talk of intel moving to offer more license able opt-in features for hardware capabilities

30
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,040
found within a given processor and so we are now seeing the linux signs of support coming with a

31
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,560
driver for the intel software to find silicon to allow for secure activation of such features

32
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:24,240
baked into a processor silicon but only available as an upcharge option yeah michael larable did

33
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:29,440
some digging on this and kind of makes it clear the basic idea is that without having to purchase

34
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:36,400
a new processor intel software defined silicon allow for activating additional hardware capabilities

35
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,920
just by purchasing a license or upgrade unfortunately right now the exact details

36
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:48,320
don't appear to be public for what these upgrades might actually have in them but intel is currently

37
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:56,160
preparing the linux kernel driver support known as sdsi this driver exposes a per socket interface

38
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:01,360
so that intel's user space application can provision an authentication key certificate

39
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,720
which is then written to internal nv ram but it also allows provisioning what they call a

40
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,000
capability activation payload and it also handles the boring stuff of just reading out what

41
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,760
configuration the cpu state is right now oh okay so what we have here is this software defined cpu

42
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:25,600
that allows these hooks for authentication of various add-on packages initially targeting the

43
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,960
xeon line of intel cpus which i think you could probably understand why i'm curious how people in

44
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:37,760
the mumble room though feel about software defined cpu essentially a piece of hardware that ships you

45
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:44,000
buy it and there is features and capabilities in that chip that you just don't get access to until

46
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,680
you pay this is not a new concept we have seen this before but this seems like a whole new level

47
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,280
and you could almost kind of see this taking off in a way you know maybe an lte modem that has

48
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,160
extra 5g capabilities if you license those capabilities as an end user you know in that

49
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,480
purchase just 29.99 a month to activate these in cpu or in chip features i mean i think we've

50
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,520
already seen this to some extent with some of those arm boards right where you gotta get a

51
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,840
license to do some of the video encoding or decoding mini mac we're probably seeing this

52
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,560
because intel is going to target businesses initially definitely i see this as a business

53
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:25,120
feature so probably it's it's just a must that that thing has linux support i don't think this

54
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:31,280
is really for private users bite didn't they try something like this with itanium yeah so uh hp had

55
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:39,600
a system where they want to give the cpu a sort of offload of the processor so moving those kind of

56
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,080
functions to the software the software defining what instructions had to be executed and then the

57
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:53,520
software could just run through all the instruction needed and so thereby creating a more efficient

58
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,360
processor but yeah and you know what happened with the itanium right i mean this whole thing

59
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,160
i'm sort of sitting here going is this what intel is spending their time on right now this is what

60
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,080
they're worried about is licensing additional features instead of just making the absolutely

61
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:15,120
most kick-ass processors possible and shipping them as fast as possible but the reality is i

62
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:21,120
think there's like a cold business calculation here because making these cpus they're producing

63
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,760
these things in these massive quantities and it is cheaper and easier to produce if they're all

64
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:31,440
exactly the same and then they just turn things on and off via software which is not much further

65
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,920
than we are today where they're all manufacturing like say the cpu they're manufacturing tens of

66
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:42,080
thousands of them and a few of them a core doesn't light up properly or maybe a couple things just

67
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:49,040
don't pass a specific set of tests and so they will re-bin that as a lower brand cpu oh this is

68
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,760
the this is the four core version instead of the eight core because maybe one core doesn't test out

69
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,000
successfully so they'll disable them several of them and ship it as a four core instead of an eight

70
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,760
core processor when it's essentially the same silicon i mean that is something that already

71
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:08,000
happens today this feels like an extension of that but there is something i think initially when i

72
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,240
read these kinds of stories as a long time free software user i have this really like screw

73
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,280
licensing you know what like licensing can get the hell out of here i am so sick and tired of

74
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,040
software licensing i would like just no licenses and everybody just essentially operates as if the

75
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,120
gpl were just cultural practice but that's never going to happen but anyways that's but at the

76
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,800
core of me i just don't like licensing and i don't like it in software and i really don't like it in

77
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,800
hardware well it's a reminder that at the root of these computers that we try to fill with free and

78
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,640
open source software is this black box that we you know we don't really have full control over

79
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:49,360
and it just feels like a little bit kind of you know we've done this huge shift to services and

80
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,040
this isn't quite the same but it feels like it's kind of in that direction of changing the

81
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:58,400
relationship of i bought this thing it's static and i know what i've got and that's how i calculated

82
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,400
the cost whereas now that's a little more complicated yeah that's totally it that's

83
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,040
totally it we put all this energy and time and thought into the software stack that we run and

84
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:12,400
try to get it as free as possible and then we have dozens of black boxes baked into our

85
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:20,400
dozens of black boxes baked into our motherboard that's absolutely part of it oh there was an

86
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:26,080
interesting steam deck update this last week we talked a little bit about this on linux action

87
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,200
news you probably heard that epic and battle i have updated their anti-cheat software to support

88
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:38,080
games under proton on linux actually functioning now there's been so many top tier games that linux

89
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:44,640
users could theoretically technically play because proton was capable of making that game run but it

90
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,840
would fail to run because of anti-cheat software and as we noted on linux action news this week

91
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,480
that has been addressed by both battle eye and epic however game developers still need to patch

92
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,320
their games but no matter how you look at this this is huge news for linux gaming in this last

93
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:09,280
week this is ginormous news and it immediately means that some of the most popular games on steam

94
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:16,320
are now theoretically within reach of linux users yeah personally i'm hoping dead by daylight season

95
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,240
updates soon i suppose maybe now is time to reach out and voice our linux user opinions about games

96
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,040
we like and would like to see these updates although hopefully we do it politely yeah i'd

97
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,960
love to see destiny to get support that's what i would love to see and i think that's battle i

98
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:36,480
but all that aside for the moment we'll just have to wait and see there was one small update from

99
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,680
valve that seemed to have gotten missed in all the anti-cheat coverage but it's one that we're

100
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:49,200
kind of excited about in the recently updated steam deck faq there are two new questions and

101
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:55,360
answers that really did stand out the first asks if the steam deck will support booting from the

102
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:04,480
sd card which valve answers really quite simply yes steam deck supports boot from micro sd that's

103
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,240
great you're going to be able to boot different distros off of the sd card and there was a second

104
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,680
part of the faq that that backs us up the specific question was and this is a quote from the faq

105
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,360
which we have linked what can you tell us about the bios and does it allow dual boot and valve

106
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,880
answered multi boot is supported you can have multiple os's installed and choose which one you

107
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:33,920
want to put into users will have access to the bios menu what do i even say to this this is

108
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:41,040
suspiciously open i mean wow huge this means we're going to be able to see community takes on that

109
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,720
that steam deck experience that will have essentially zero barrier to entry i'm very

110
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,000
excited about this like i just i can't overstate it because it's going to allow a lot of people to

111
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,440
participate in creating a software experience for this hardware what if it's too easy though

112
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,760
you know there's no it's not like hacking linux onto a we or something they're almost begging us

113
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,040
to do yeah so i mean really what we have to see here happen is a couple of things we have to see

114
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:13,680
game developers update their game to support these new anti-cheat updates it looks like it's crazy

115
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:20,480
easy epic seems to indicate it's very simple they say quote starting with the latest sdk release

116
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,360
developers can activate anti-cheat support for linux via wine or proton with just a few clicks

117
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,960
in their epic online services developer portal that's from epic battle eye says well we already

118
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:36,640
had linux support but now we've specifically done an update to support proton that's number one is

119
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,840
game developers are going to have to update the game to support this anti-cheat stuff number two

120
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:47,840
and i'm not 100 but this looks pretty solid from what we can tell you're going to need linux 5.11

121
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,360
so you're going to need a linux kernel or you're going to be able to upgrade your kernel to 511 or

122
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,400
newer because you need a kernel that supports syscall user dispatch which is some work that

123
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:01,200
was done to make these these anti-cheat other things that are running in wine communicate

124
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,240
better on linux and if you don't have that support it looks like some of this anti-cheat stuff might

125
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,880
not work i haven't able to test that obviously so i can't tell you for sure but from our digging

126
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,920
around that looks to be the case and from what you can tell that seems like that's probably likely

127
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:24,000
right neil with linux 5.11 collabora on contract with valve made some changes that were upstream

128
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,520
that called syscall user dispatch which provides a way for user space to to register hooks to the

129
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:38,080
linux kernel for syscall interfaces and apis and things like that this is particularly necessary

130
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:46,400
for games because a lot of anti-cheat software work by directly calling windows nt syscalls

131
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,040
instead of using like the standard c library and going through user space the normal way

132
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:57,600
and they would fail in wine because linux doesn't know what that syscall is and they would just

133
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:04,480
break so what this does is it allows wine to register a handler in linux for syscalls just

134
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,280
like it does for binary format so like when you load in an executive a windows exe file

135
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:14,240
linux knows that this actually needs to be run by the wine bin loader rather than the

136
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:23,280
glibc bin loader and so that same process then allows you to run applications that would normally

137
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:31,360
talk to windows nt directly to then successfully be redirected back to wine for wine server to

138
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:37,280
handle and the wine fake nt kernel to give it what it expects so that the applications will

139
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:42,080
run properly that's what's so impressive about all of this right is like the the long-term work

140
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:47,440
where we got changes actually upstreamed in the kernel to a better enable playing proprietary

141
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,360
games on linux and that valve at the same time negotiated behind the scenes with these anti-cheat

142
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,480
vendors to you know actually get that working yeah and i think it's it's just nice to remember

143
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,320
that collabra is behind the scenes in some of this doing some of the work making some of this

144
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,840
possible at some of the lower levels and you've had valve clearly pulling the strings now for

145
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:14,080
about a couple of years laying the groundwork this particular groundwork for the deck and

146
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,640
you couldn't look at it necessarily from the outside and see that's where it's going but

147
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:24,000
now with hindsight it's obvious they were building towards a device now it's just obvious it just

148
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,520
stands out um so that's probably what you need to know is you're probably going to end up needing

149
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:33,440
a kernel 5 11 or newer um and uh that's you know by the time the deck shipping and all that that's

150
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,280
that's probably not going to be too hard to achieve so that we'll have links to information

151
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:44,000
about that in the show notes at linuxunplug.com 4 25 but we need to talk about a little community

152
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,840
news in fact something coming up very soon daniel foray joins us from the elementary os project

153
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:54,880
welcome back hey how's it going it's going really good i'm curious you know i want to talk about the

154
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,960
hackathon that's coming up because it's just in a couple of days but before we get to that

155
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:04,880
tell us how version 6 is going because i think it's been about a month since elementary os 6 came

156
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:11,120
out there's been an update how are things shaking out yeah it's been about a month and a half now

157
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:18,160
since release so we had um we do updates every single month so at the end of uh last month we

158
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:24,320
did a smaller updates post and we're packaging up all our updates uh to go out now with tons of new

159
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:30,400
features for online accounts tasks mail app center like everything's getting lots of goodies and i

160
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,160
being dense because i'm sure it was probably it was probably communicated pretty clearly

161
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,560
but i completely missed that there is like a monthly update cadence thing now yeah actually

162
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:44,480
we started that um last cycle uh and so we're kind of continuing that over but we wanted to

163
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,040
make sure that we're not just pushing out bug fixes and feature updates like every couple years

164
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,920
because it's not a super great experience we want to push them out monthly because then we can get

165
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,080
that feedback loop really tight where you know people are reporting an issue or they're requesting

166
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,760
a feature and we want to get that out to them as soon as possible so they feel more involved

167
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,360
okay well let me ask you this is there anything that stands out in your mind

168
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:14,320
today that is kind of different or changed since elementary os 6 0 you know version 0.0 shipped

169
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,560
i guess there been anything behind the scenes that has changed in the last 30 days anything

170
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,280
that stands out i mean i think um some of the biggest things are that we're making a lot of

171
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:29,440
progress with app center with flat pack we've been working with the wider community on some of the

172
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,640
free desktop stuff like with the dark style support across you know all the apps and and so we're

173
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:41,840
going to be working more on portals and that kind of stuff we kind of redid our ci and cd system

174
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:46,960
recently so we're now building our flat packs for arm so we're going to have app center

175
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:52,000
apps building for arm and they're all flat packs now so we're like we're going to have this really

176
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,480
great collection of apps that you can go run on any distro now if you go to appcenter.elementary.io

177
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,240
you can go download those flat packs for whatever distro and we're just going to keep growing that

178
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,480
and make it super awesome wow that sounds rad yeah very impressive that's some serious work

179
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,920
you're putting in that's really cool okay so let's talk about this hacktoberfest live stream

180
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:17,200
that's coming up isn't it this thursday yeah so uh what's going on with that is that uh it's a

181
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:22,240
really great time in the cycle right now because you know we just released so it's not really like

182
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,800
the end of the cycle it's like the beginning of our development cycle and so we have a great

183
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:32,640
opportunity to get people involved and you know try to talk about like what projects we want to

184
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:39,200
pursue during this cycle and we have hacktoberfest coming up which is the event put on by digital

185
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,160
ocean and github so we're going to do a stream on thursday and we're going to talk about how to get

186
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:50,560
involved with hacking on elementary os and working on new features and cool stuff like that and we're

187
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,800
going to try to you know tie that into hacktoberfest so if you've never heard of that and you want to

188
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,960
try to get involved you can come find out how you can get some free swag for contributing to open

189
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,640
source projects on github right on but you know it's fall when hacktoberfest rolls around it's

190
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,280
like a milestone of the year so what is an easy place for people to go to get involved if they're

191
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,960
interested and they have some time on thursday if you want to go to our get involved page actually

192
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,560
elementary.io forward slash git dash involved we have links there for all kinds of stuff but

193
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:25,040
if you want to watch out for our youtube page we have a link to our youtube page on our website

199
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,400
with elementary os6 and it sounds like the hacktoberfest thing is going to be a lot of fun

200
00:18:52,400 --> 00:19:00,320
thanks for joining us thank you and i'll see all you guys on thursday lino dot com slash unplugged

201
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:05,440
go there to get 100 in 60 day credit on your new account and you go there to support the show

202
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:12,000
linode keeps getting better i have been a customer for about two and a half years and i can absolutely

203
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,800
testify to this i'll admit though i was watching them for a while you know when these new like

204
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:22,400
vc supercharged fly by night vps providers came along and were offering all these different things

205
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,320
i sat back and wanted to see what linode would do because you know they're kind of like the old

206
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,880
timer in the linux community they've been around for 18 years i was like are they gonna fumble this

207
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,080
are they gonna get passed up by the new kids or are they gonna stay competitive

208
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,920
and sure enough they they really really have in fact now they're lapping those kids linode just

209
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:47,840
upgraded their block storage with super fast mvme pcie storage and it screams you can get

210
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,520
systems with amd epic processors that benchmark faster than any other major cloud provider and

211
00:19:53,520 --> 00:20:01,120
pair it with mvme block storage okay it's amazing and then they have 11 data centers you can choose

212
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,480
from and they have become their own isp so they have secured super fast links between their data

213
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,840
centers 40 gigabit connections coming into the hypervisors and then they wrap it all up with a

214
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:18,320
beautiful easy to use dashboard that lets you get under the hood when you need and i mean i actually

215
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:25,440
have a linode that i completely replaced the image that they ship with it like i wiped the box and i

216
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:33,120
put a custom linux distro from a router vendor to create an lte mesh vpn endpoint and they actually

217
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:39,200
linode actually let me like wipe it off and set up my own custom box there and now the crazy cats

218
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,560
are launching bare metal servers if you really need like just the ultimate performance and it

219
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,800
doesn't matter if you've never set up a box before because they've got easy one-click deployments so

220
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,040
say maybe you're ready to switch to next cloud they got a one-click deployment for that or maybe

221
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,920
something just like a little more like in between like are you done using zoom and you'd like to

222
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:02,080
use something you can trust and open source they've got a one-click deployment for jitsi

223
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:08,240
and there's really no excuse and they're 30 to 50 cheaper than the big duopoly hyperscalers you

224
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,520
can get like a five dollar a month box that runs jitsi that's a pretty justifiable business expense

225
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:19,440
in my opinion but i i really encourage you to go play turn it up to 11 because you can get a hundred

226
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,800
dollars that and when you look at their pricing that's that's incredible that really is great so

227
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,960
go try it out i can tell you all about it all day long but you need to go see it for yourself and

228
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,360
you can support the show it's an opportunity to go play learn and support the show you can call it

229
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,080
like the trifecta of awesome so just head over to linode.com slash unplugged get a hundred dollars

230
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:43,600
for your new account and try all this stuff out build something learn something test something

231
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,640
there are a lot of ways you can host i admit it there's a lot of them out there and there is some

232
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:55,040
big big hyperscalers that they'd love you to just put everything you own into their systems but

233
00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:00,800
nobody does it like linode that's why they've been around 18 years and that's why i completely

234
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:07,280
recommend them go see why we choose linode every single time by going to linode.com slash unplugged

235
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,200
there's a few things i'd like to mention in the housekeeping section first of all thank you to our

236
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:20,160
members over at unpluggedcore.com the live stream feed has just been delivering mr roach joined us

237
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,080
in the mumble room and told us about his time interning at pixar and about the linux boxes

238
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:29,120
there that was awesome we had so many great conversations that's available to our members

239
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:35,120
in the totally uncut bootleg feed we also create a limited ad version that's the same type production

240
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,000
just a little bit shorter and you support the show at unpluggedcore.com i also wanted to let

241
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,960
you know that our buddy joe has a new show a new member of the late night linux family it's called

242
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,880
linux after dark go check it out it's in your favorite podcast catcher already episode one

243
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,640
is already out i'd also like to encourage you to join our luck plug it happens every single

244

sunday at noon pacific in our mumble room right there in the lobby you can figure it out at your

245
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:07,280
time zone at jupiter broadcasting dot com slash calendar and all of our mumble info is at linux

246
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:13,200
unplug.com slash mumble and the nice thing is you get it set up if you're ever around on a tuesday

247
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,480
you can come join us and hang out in the show and get your word in on uh your weekly linux talk

248
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:25,760
show that's linux unplug.com slash mumble for that okay wes i i know we've talked a lot about

249
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,080
the server recently but this is kind of you know it's what's happening right now and there's some

250
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,960
big stuff in the works you think it's okay if we just maybe one more time touch on this subject

251
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,440
well we have to right it's clearly becoming an issue and the audience needs a resolution

252
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,600
we need a resolution too well yeah that too so just in case you haven't caught previous coverage

253
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,000
just super briefly our goal with this arch server that we have here in our studio has been a bit of

254
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,360
a long-term experiment i think you know too often you'll see online reviewers who spend 30 or

255
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:01,760
40 minutes with something if that and then they go make their video or their blog or whatever

256
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,840
maybe it's just a forum post somebody you know talking smart in a forum giving you their opinion

257
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,000
people speak with authority after they try something for a little bit they kind of they

258
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,400
because they speak with authority to it it kind of gets accepted as maybe expert opinion

259
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,880
and then before you know it it's all over the entire internet as fact

260
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:24,480
and so we love pushing back against that kind of stuff and we also know that how something holds

261
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:31,040
up long term is a totally different story than how something is during your first impressions

262
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:36,800
right i've been like i'm i'm already preparing myself for our fedora 35 review because i've

263
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:42,720
been running fedora 35 for the last two weeks so that by the time it ships in a month i'm gonna

264
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,520
have a pretty rounded opinion of that distribution and some of it will be you know it's during it's

265
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,240
a beta cycle but some of it's like i'm a forming opinion now about gnome 41 and i i truly believe

266
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,880
whenever we can we try to really experience something as long as possible and when we can't

267
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,240
we come right off and we'll tell you hey man this is a first this is a first

268
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,040
opinion you know first impressions kind of thing with this server we wanted to try actually running

269
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:10,000
arch in production for an extended period of time and see if we could make a few tweaks to make it

270
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,800
keep running like you know using the lts kernel file system snapshots utilizing butter fs on the

271
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:22,240
root file system and then using zfs on the large external data pool not that we necessarily

272
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,120
recommend you do any of this but we wanted to test it to see how it would hold up we wanted

273
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,680
to find out so you didn't have to run a rolling arch server in production well and we both had

274
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:36,400
such good experience with arch you know on the workstation on various machines in our life and

275
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,280
we both knew that it had all the software and kind of got out of our way in terms of managing

276
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:45,520
it was like a pleasant environment that we were both familiar with to admin so it was tempting

277
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,200
to just see like yeah can we make it work here too and i should have looked it up before the

278
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,640
show but i'm pretty sure we've crossed the year mark running this thing in production in fact we

279
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,840
might even be rounding the second year possibly and it's it's all out there we've tried to put

280
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,320
all of it out there as much as publicly possible so if this thing blows up on her face you know

281
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,920
and you know because that's our our singular motivation is really just to prove if it's

282
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:11,360
possible and if it's not we're gonna find out for you and the reality is this is a production

283
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,120
server we really do use it so when it breaks it breaks in front of everyone and it hurts

284
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:22,000
and you know it's out in a garage it's not particularly well thermally protected in fact

285
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,240
it's not at all and there has even been some power outages recently and that's what's led us to some

286
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:33,280
of the more recent issues initially we had some lockups that we traced back to net data but we

287
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,880
weren't sure right before the road trip about a week before the road trip the server started

288
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,880
locking up the worst timing impossible yeah we got it up and running again suspecting it was net

289
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:49,280
data we turned off net data and the system remained running for you know a month maybe

290
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:55,440
then about three weeks into my road trip the server went down i checked in i couldn't wire guard

291
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,320
i couldn't talk to the server at all but i was able to use rust desk to get to a couple of the

292
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:07,440
studio desktops and using that approach i determined oh power went out for a while and

293
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,000
the funky way we have this thing wired up is one power supplies into the wall and one power supplies

294
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,880
into ups for stupid technical debt reasons and i think when that happened the server got into

295
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:24,560
a funky state and it eventually lost power then when it rebooted it came up in a bad way and never

296
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:31,440
finished booting and i couldn't tell why because i was i was gone i was on a road trip and the old

297
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:39,600
server admin in me was dying i had to know why my server was down plus i wanted my server back up

298
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,200
right i mean here was this situation that we hadn't actually encountered right i mean we've

299
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,840
we've seen it power cycled we've come back into the studio after the power went out and it's

300
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,560
always been fun i mean it takes forever to do so but but it gets there yeah and of course it happens

301
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:58,320
while wes is camping so i'm i'm gone wes is camping and then moving the whole thing was just

302
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:04,400
like the worst time possible so we didn't know why it was back up and so like the last day of the

303
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:11,280
road trip i legitimately just made a beeline for the studio i was just i got lady jupes to her spot

304
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:17,680
i got lady jupes secured and parked and then i jumped in the car and i ran down to the studio

305
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:23,280
to figure out what was wrong and i mean i literally i maybe was back in town from the road

306
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:42,080
from the road trip for a grand total of an hour before i was in the car and headed directly to the studio

307
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,840
uh-oh that's not a good sound

308
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:57,200
well i've been in town for about an hour and i've already made it to the studio to try to figure out

309
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,240
what's going on with the server

310
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,560
getting a beep

311
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:15,920
that seems bad

312
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,200
i'm gonna shut her down

313
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,480
seems that the console is locked right now

314
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,680
take it down take it down we did have a power outage here seems like i didn't expect it to be

315
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,680
on i thought it was going to be off

316
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,880
i'm going to pull the power completely it's got a dual power supply

317
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,560
go hug them back up

318
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,920
both power supply fans are working

319
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,920
oh immediately getting the beep

320
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:12,400
hold on the beep just stopped the red light on the front of the chassis just cleared

321
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,080
still waiting for console it hasn't posted yet

322
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:30,080
there we go we've got post yes okay keep booting you bastard keep booting and it did and i i was

323
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:36,400
sitting there thinking man i i expected some sort of catastrophic hardware issue and the entire time

324
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:41,040
i kept thinking how could i have done this differently let's do a ping check

325
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:49,280
let's do a ping check yes i am getting ping all right let's check if containers are up

326
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,680
uh yes i think yes yes containers are up

327
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:09,360
yeah they're definitely up there's a lot going on look at all that okay great

328
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:16,000
okay i'm gonna go uh applications plunking see if everything's working and it was i mean for the

329
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,200
next 24 hours or so the server ran great we were able to connect in over wire guard it was chewing

330
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,440
away on a backlog of work just like it was supposed to it started sinking out results to

331
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,640
lady jupes it was glorious everything and i was just like god i appreciate this i don't know why

332
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:36,640
it crashed but i appreciate it so that was you know thursday or so friday things seemed fine

333
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,440
saturday i kind of i got wrapped up in stuff we were doing with the kids and i didn't really keep

334
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:48,240
an eye on things but wes and i arrived at the studio on sunday to record linux action news

335
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,080
just as we sat down to get started we noticed something wasn't quite right and it didn't take

336
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:59,360
us long to figure out the server had crashed again let's go check on it server's down we're

337
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:05,280
going to go check on it we're recording land but we got to stop i got i got fish sticks air frying

338
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:09,280
we got to see what's wrong with the server oh it's dark out here too

339
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:18,720
none of the discs are flashing it's not beeping but this is like the state it was in the previously

340
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,440
before my road trip where it would just kind of lock up and then you i could tell immediately

341
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,760
because the fans are low and none of the hard drives are flat it's not working at all and when

342
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:32,800
you got that many hard drives there's always at least one flashing let's turn the console on here

343
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,800
what will we see i bet you it's just totally locked

344
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,560
just locked it's hard it's just hard i wonder i wonder if net data started back up maybe it did

345
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:49,920
and what is it probing so we gotta we gotta power it off and we'll start it back up and make sure

346
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:55,360
net data isn't running hello over the face yeah there's nothing that feels better than physically

347
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,840
powering off your server over and over again like that's not going to lead to problems i recommend

348
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:05,920
you do it all the time i think it's off i think that's it this is as low as the fans ever go

349
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:16,880
yeah here we go also i like how all of them light up red that's great really reassuring don't freak

350
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:22,000
me out at all all right well i think we'll just watch this boot up it's gonna boot up fine i would

351
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:31,600
imagine and uh we'll make sure net data isn't auto starting maybe i only stopped it and didn't

352
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:37,360
disable it sounds like you i can't believe it was freaking net data again wes so i had not disabled

353
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:43,760
it i had only stopped it previously before the road trip i mean you say net data i i surmise

354
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,720
that you know anything poking those might do the same thing right really we have to figure out do

355
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,320
net data as a monitoring agent we want to use something else to scrape the metrics do we want

356
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:57,040
to just try to disable some of that you know poking the hardware monitor functionality for

357
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:01,520
the time being i don't know we have bigger fish to fry first but we'll have to solve that down

358
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:07,120
the road yeah i think you and i both kind of suspect there's some sort of hardware issue

359
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,320
and net data is poking whatever that issue is and causing the lockup because when you get hard

360
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:19,120
locks like this it almost always ends up being hardware and i remember now i hadn't disabled

361
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:24,880
it because my intention was after the road trip to come back and fire net data back up and see if

362
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:30,880
it locked up again and so accidentally we ended up testing that theory and it did seem to hold

363
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:36,080
so as long as we leave net data disabled the system continues to run and assuming the power

364
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:40,400
doesn't go out and i don't really know why it was in an air state other than i think one power

365
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,000
supply is plugged into the wall one's plugged into the ups they've lost power at different times and

366
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,720
it just sort of went into this failed hardware state and had that beep you could hear but you

367
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:55,680
know what we have got some major stuff in the works very excited about this uh it's clear we

368
00:34:55,680 --> 00:35:01,120
need to replace the server we knew that before this latest round uh we bought it used it has

369
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:06,880
served its term it started life as a free nasbox and then i think it lived life as a fedora box

370
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:14,480
for a while it has seen some stuff yeah and we have figured out that we really need like a

371
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:22,800
three-phase approach to replacing this thing so phase one is going to be replacing the server

372
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,920
it's well actually i'm going to flip this west phase one is going to be breaking out wire guard

373
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,640
onto its own dedicated box so that way in the future if our server crashes we can still get

374
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:38,240
access to the network now we solve that with nebula and rust desk but we'd like to have the

375
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:44,880
vpn capabilities removed from the server itself and on a different machine the debate there is

376
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,360
and i'm curious where you fall down west we could do it on a raspberry pi like we could have a wire

377
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:56,960
guard pie or we could replace that comcast router with like an open sense box and do open sense and

378
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:02,240
wire guard on one box what do you think hmm yeah there are a lot of options i mean i think we have

379
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:07,840
to decide yeah how many different things we want to administer and and how much i am kind of curious

380
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:12,480
to see how well a pie would perform and that does have some nice options in terms of you know you

381
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,880
have a whole bunch of pies laying around i do too so it'd be easy to drop in and test and we could

382
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:22,640
do that real quick do you think a pie would be fast enough to be the firewall like i'm picturing

383
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:28,320
a linux box with some basic firewall and routing we might just have to try right i don't i don't

384
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:33,200
know i mean maybe put pie hole in a container for the dns and dhcp and then you know if it wasn't we

385
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:38,400
could always migrate it to another rig later neil says the pie won't be fast enough for performance

386
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,760
network stuff like almost always you need hardware acceleration for packet handling but we're just on

387
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,640
a comcast connection it's like 300 megabits it's not just that it's about how fast you can push it

388
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:55,440
not how wide you can go so yes sure like you can blow out the bandwidth of it any day of the week

389
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,320
and that'll also be a problem but like the problem you're going to have more often is that you need

390
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:05,840
it to be low latency and you need those packets to go out as fast as they can as close to line

391
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:10,720
rate as possible especially when you're live yeah so raspberry pi would not work this is just why i

392
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,800
kind of want to test it though yeah i i wonder and if the other thing i was thinking and maybe

393
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:21,360
people could write in at linux unpluged dot com slash contact but like a really low power x86 box

394
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:28,480
that has ipmi it's like a micro atx itx kind of like tiny box there are a few mini pcs that do

395
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,280
actually have a bmc built in that you can use that might be something to look at as well but so i

396
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,840
think phase one is going to be figuring out our vpn stuff and you can see there's some some stuff

397
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:44,640
we got to sort out then phase two is replacing the server itself and the biggest challenge here has

398
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:49,920
become the disc we need about 40 terabyte of new disc to come in that's clearly going to be the

399
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:56,080
largest cost then the second challenge with a new server is what distro should we use obviously

400
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:00,720
we've been using arch for a while it's been great and there's certainly a part of me that would like

401
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,840
to just continue to use arch to see like how far can we take this thing before it breaks you know

402
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:12,000
we already have some more updates on the server i just checked oh man but also i recognize this

403
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,600
is an opportunity for us to try something else as well so in the show notes we'll have a link

404
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:24,160
to a straw poll and i would like the audience to vote on which server distro we go with next

405
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:29,360
there are only a few options because we've limited it to genuinely rolling distributions

406
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:34,640
rawhide's on the list right now but neil brings up a good point that we could have significant

407
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:40,720
issues with cfs if we went rawhide but not necessarily impossible to solve for so we have

408
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:48,480
arch nix tumbleweed and rawhide all as an option for you to vote on right now the live audience

409
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:56,160
has gotten 42 votes in so far these often will indicate the trend and right now tumbleweed is

410
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:03,280
in the lead with 45.24 percent of the votes rawhide's in second place nix is in third and

411
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,680
arch is in fourth if you have an opinion about this we're going to leave the poll going for the

412
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:12,400
next week so go to the show notes we'll have a straw poll in there it's a crazy url so i just

413
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:20,080
tell you what it is and go vote and uh we're very likely i mean like 99 likely unless some weird

414
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:25,200
reason comes up gonna go with the distro that you guys choose rawhide gives me the most pause

415
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:30,000
so not saying we're not gonna pick it but it's gonna require wes and i having a strong discussion

416
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,480
if it does if it wins i like that this is the option you're the least sure of what a funny

417
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,160
world but you're right i mean there will be some complications we might have to learn a fair bit

418
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:45,120
about the internals of rawhide or tumbleweed if the if the trend line continues my friend which

419
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:51,360
that's a whole new world what have we done using snapper so i guess like in that sense you know

420
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:59,520
maybe it makes sense but true true there's also the hardware component of the server and i cannot

421
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:06,560
believe this but the ups tracking numbers don't lie a listener has reached out mr real zombie geek

422
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:14,160
is sending us some new server gear new to us he's actually decommissioning it but he has in route

423
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:21,920
right now should be delivered tomorrow at the studio a dell poweredge r820 with and i i just

424
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:32,000
can't even believe this four intel e5 4657 cpus each with 12 cores four of them with 12 cores

425
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:40,640
and 384 gigabytes of ecc ram hey yo right i mean this i mean even if like it's maybe it's only two

426
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:45,840
intel i can't imagine it's four maybe it's only two xeons that's gonna be an amazing amazing amount

427
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:50,800
of compute for us uh he's shipping it with no caddies or drives so we're gonna have to figure

428
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,040
out what kind of caddies that r820 takes and i'm gonna i'll go on ebay probably and buy like a

429
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,880
whole batch of them so i've got some prep work to do here yeah and then jb's got to buy some

430
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:04,880
discs right but i mean he's saving us a huge cost and i was considering going with another pre-owned

431
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:10,080
server anyways and he's had this in production it's been a solid box he's just replacing it and

432
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:15,440
he offered it to us and i just i can't believe it that's wonderful best audience in the universe

433
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,360
there's just no doubt about it so that'll be the hardware whatever distro you all vote on will be

434
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:23,680
what we put on there and then there'll be the third phase the third phase is going to be to

435
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:28,960
set up some kind of remote console we were initially trending towards pi kvm and i think we

436
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:34,720
still may try try that because i ordered a little pi kvm kit oh look at you but this power edge has

437
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:40,320
a built-in idrac enterprise which may be just fine with we'll see yeah i'm kind of it'd be interesting

438
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:44,800
to compare and contrast so with idrac there might be even some fun automation potential that you

439
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:50,640
could you could work with because like i know that in in rail and centos and i think also in fedora

440
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:55,920
and it would be in tumbleweed as well there's a lot of tools around integrating with various bmcs

441
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:04,720
ilo from hpe generic ipmi redfish extended ipmi and idrac as well from dell so there's all kinds

442
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:12,080
of fun opportunities there if you have like built-in management interfaces like that i love

443
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:18,480
that yeah i can't believe it i mean what a what a gift to us right now because you know we just

444
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,720
caught back from that road trip so expenses are tight right now so that's a great thing to have

445
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:27,520
come along and uh should be great to play with and i don't know what i'll i may put the old server on

446
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,520
a test bench and see if i can't narrow down what the issues are or it may just sit there for a bit

447
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:37,280
we shall see but either way that's the that's the plan we have a three-phase plan to get this server

448
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:42,400
going and uh wes and i are already beginning to play around with vpn options there's some really

449
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,960
fun stuff out there we often talk about the desktop stuff because it's fun and we love the

450
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:53,120
desktop but there's so much awesome stuff going on at these layers too so it'll be fun to deep

451
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:58,320
dive into that and i'd love to get your opinion on which distro we should go with next so go find

452
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:05,600
the straw poll link at linux unplug.com 425 oh it's time for feedback and hey maybe if you've

453
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:10,240
got some ideas on what we should do in any of those phases well yeah right into the show but

454
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:16,480
in the meantime aaron's already done that with a self-hosted location tracker he really likes

455
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,640
now of course we had that set up at colony tracker.live a different piece of software

456
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:26,960
that we've been testing out for the road trip but aaron has been using a nextcloud app called phone

457
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:31,200
track this is an app for nextcloud i think i've seen this before yeah i think we just need to

458
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:36,320
install it on the jupyter nextcloud instance that we've already got running as aaron suggests

459
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:42,160
although i haven't actually tried it yet i like this as an overall approach to like taking something

460
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:47,680
that i think a lot of us think is is taboo like user tracking and cameras right having cameras in

461
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:53,920
your home oh i like taking that and putting it on its damn nose and saying well what if i do the

462
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:59,360
tracking and i control the data well what if i run cameras but they only work on my lan and they go

463
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:04,560
into something like shinobi and i record the cameras and can technology that we often consider

464
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:11,760
invasive be used by me under my control and that aspect of phone track really appeals here because

465
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,160
it's part of just hosting something yourself and if you've already gone to the trouble of setting

466
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:21,200
up nextcloud you install this app and i think it has an android companion app too yeah you know

467
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,840
aaron hits on that that he'd been on a journey to google fly and that location tracking was

468
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:29,680
one piece of that and i think it kind of makes sense in some sense to have it integrated with

469
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:34,800
nextcloud because yeah nextcloud can be a big part in getting off a lot of those popular google

470
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,440
services and for his part he does notice that the phone app has worked pretty well and that

471
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:45,200
he hasn't seen a hit to the battery life hmm yeah you can have it set so it sort of gets a the

472
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:50,320
background location update from the android operating system we opted not to go with this

473
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:56,800
just because we didn't really want to put our nextcloud instance public and own tracks was sort

474
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:02,880
of perfect for our use case but by ben if i recall you gave this a go for a bit right yeah so i use

475
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:11,360
it to track my phone and for when i lose it then i can find it again and it works really well it

476
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:16,560
also says when it's collecting its gps points how many it's already sent how many there are in the

477
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:23,840
session and it's also a really good platform for example if you've got drivers or delivery guys

478
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:31,360
driving around you can see it really easily on a map and a nice overview and you see they have

479
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:39,440
put some thought in multiple use cases but what i also noticed is you really need to get a good use

480
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:45,120
of these sessions because i have for example one session of my phone tracking and once i pull that

481
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:51,840
up my living area is just one big red dot about yeah you've been there there are all the lines

482
00:45:52,480 --> 00:46:00,960
and i don't know if it's my amount of data or my setup but the filtering isn't that really great

483
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:09,520
for me at the moment but i assume they will be fixing that in later versions but yeah you can

484
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:16,080
select specific sessions you want to record to and you can put devices in there but you have to look

485
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:23,840
at if you need to select the session from your device itself so that is for me at least question

486
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:30,400
mark if you can put devices in there from the server side okay that's good to know for people

487
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,240
that might be interested in using it and we'll have a link to that in the show notes if you

488
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,080
want to try it or actually no you know what no you just go in your next cloud you look in the

489
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:42,400
apps and you just install it right there no link for you no link no link for you i will put a link

490
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:48,080
to this though because i am on the search for i'd love something that's a server side web app

491
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:53,840
that i hit up on my land and i paste a youtube url in and it downloads in the background and

492
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:58,560
puts it somewhere on my file system and then i open up my media player of choice and it's

493
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,000
connected to my nas and bam there's the youtube video and i've been looking for a web app to do

494
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,800
this for a while and i don't know if i found the perfect one but i think i found a real contender

495
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:14,240
it's called tube archivist it is a self-hosted youtube media server you give it the urls and

496
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:19,920
then it will archive them and then present you a front end to review all of your downloads kind of

497
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:25,680
give you like your own youtube um subscription feed but on your own box where it's pulled down

498
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:30,880
the videos locally oh this looks nice yeah man and it keeps track of like which ones you've

499
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:36,880
viewed and which ones you haven't viewed and uh it's using that new uh youtube dlp that we've

500
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:41,760
talked about yt dlp instead of youtube dl oh we made that a pic a couple weeks back right yep yep

501
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:47,200
so uh this is kind of like taking and putting it all together and then i like this because i thought

502
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:51,520
i've got a couple of youtubers i've followed that have like put up videos and then pulled them

503
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:57,760
but i also have a ton of videos i watch on youtube for like rv maintenance stuff and sometimes i'm in

504
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,920
an area where i want to do some work and i'm offline this is what i was hoping for is something

505
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,240
i could throw on my my box and just throw these links in there and then build a little offline

506
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:11,120
youtube collection the only spot where i kind of got hung up and why i haven't pursued it and

507
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:15,360
west you're gonna laugh at me but you know you gotta set up like elastic search and do some of

508
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:20,720
that stuff and i just i didn't want to go that far but i wanted to give it a link so you're saying

509
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:27,280
you need someone to write you a already composed docker compose file absolutely west that's exactly

510
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:33,040
what i'm saying and and also if anybody has another tool to accomplish this same thing

511
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:38,080
do let me know about it however you want to tell me because uh i'm always looking for uh for a way

512
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:42,720
to do this yeah you know i want something like this but just if it also had some like chromecast

513
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:47,600
support on the flip side you know it could kind of be the one-stop shop for all the videos uh

514
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:54,320
that would be nice yeah yeah and for me personally i don't really need a front end that tracks the

515
00:48:54,320 --> 00:49:01,200
watch status because i just would like them on the file system and then i'll throw cody or jellyfin

516
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:07,280
or plex or whatever at that directory and manage it with my existing media application so you just

517
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:12,240
want the ingest side ingest and maybe a little bit of sorting you know maybe a folder per youtube

518
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:17,600
channel and so you know if you download from this youtuber you put it in their folder automatically

519
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:21,520
i don't know i guess i'm asking for the moon here but it seems like there must be something out

520
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:26,480
there because i mean hell there's so many there were back in the day when we all watched our

521
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:32,880
television via a cable there was like a dozen different pvr dvr solutions and there was myth tv

522
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:37,520
and we just need something for the youtube age so if you know of one let me know and if you'd

523
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:42,480
like to find our friends a cloud guru on social media they're just slash a cloud guru at pretty

524
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:47,680
much any social media website the youtubes instagram slash a cloud guru go find them over

525

no no my friends we will see you right back here next tuesday

539
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:49,040
so along with their robot amazon has opened an invite only program for their previously announced

540
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:54,880
home surveillance drone the always home cam that flies around and surveys your home for you

541
00:51:54,880 --> 00:52:01,920
oh man wes oh i think i'm about ready to go move out into the woods it's really just such a shame

542
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:06,800
because it's like in some sense if i felt like i was actually in control of it yeah maybe i would

543
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,960
want that you know it was open i could i knew where the data was going but of course that's

544
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,720
not what we get that's very much like the philosophy i was just trying to articulate

545
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:18,960
in the show it's like if if it's cameras that i have complete control over and i can replace the

546
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,840
firmware and it's something i can check and monitor then yeah i'm okay with it but if it's

547
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:29,200
something that i have no control over that could be easily perverted i find that gets dystopian

548
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:34,000
really quick and it feels like there's a lot more of the ladder these days well with the dog you

549
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,080
know i was just imagining here you are you needed to sit and then suddenly the connectivity goes out

550
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:55,040
of just the worst time you
