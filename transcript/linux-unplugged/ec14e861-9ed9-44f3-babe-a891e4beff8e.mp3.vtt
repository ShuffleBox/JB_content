00:04.640 --> 00:06.240
You can thank me later.

00:06.240 --> 00:10.560
It's Google News, but in just beautiful text.

00:10.560 --> 00:14.680
Easy to read, easy to render, easy to print.

00:14.680 --> 00:17.420
Beautiful news in just glorious text.

00:17.420 --> 00:19.840
I'm going to be mad if this is more than 68k to download.

00:19.840 --> 00:31.040
Hey friends, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

00:31.040 --> 00:32.120
My name is Chris.

00:32.120 --> 00:33.360
My name is Wes.

00:33.360 --> 00:34.760
Hello, Wes.

00:34.760 --> 00:36.640
Don't make Wes angry.

00:36.640 --> 00:37.640
You wouldn't like it.

00:37.640 --> 00:38.640
No.

00:38.640 --> 00:41.720
This episode is brought to you by the all-new A Cloud Guru, the leader in learning for the

00:41.720 --> 00:43.760
cloud, Linux, and other modern tech skills.

00:43.760 --> 00:47.420
Hundreds of courses, thousands of hands-on labs, get certified, get hired, get learning

00:47.420 --> 00:50.000
at acloudguru.com.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Hi there.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Welcome into the show.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.320
It's $3.99 and I'm having a bit of a mild panic attack because I can't believe I've

00:55.320 --> 00:57.040
committed to anything for this long.

00:57.040 --> 00:58.480
It's been great though.

00:58.480 --> 01:03.200
We were just talking on the live stream about some ideas that we have for next week's episode.

01:03.200 --> 01:07.960
So I want to say right here off the top, if you'd like to help us celebrate 400, please

01:07.960 --> 01:14.200
join us live next week over at jblive.tv at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday next

01:14.200 --> 01:15.200
week.

01:15.200 --> 01:20.760
You can hang out with us to celebrate 400 episodes of this here little podcast.

01:20.760 --> 01:22.960
It's pretty great.

01:22.960 --> 01:30.640
But coming up on $3.99, we have a bit of a problem that has been building for a long

01:30.640 --> 01:33.260
time in the open source community.

01:33.260 --> 01:39.840
And so we wanted to use our 399th episode to spotlight the challenge of independent

01:39.840 --> 01:44.800
open source software developers, specifically those who are trying to invest in an application

01:44.800 --> 01:47.200
for a long period of time, say a decade.

01:47.200 --> 01:50.280
Maybe it's an application that's kind of complicated as well.

01:50.280 --> 01:52.000
It's not a fun thing to talk about.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.520
I think in a sense, it's meant that we haven't brought this up a lot because we don't have

01:56.520 --> 01:58.820
a real positive spin on this.

01:58.820 --> 02:05.040
But I think it's led us to give this issue less attention than it deserves.

02:05.040 --> 02:09.200
So coming up on the show today, we're going to talk with the developer behind Lutris,

02:09.200 --> 02:14.800
which is a phenomenal application for Linux gamers to manage their GOG library, their

02:14.800 --> 02:17.720
humble library, Steam library, all in one application.

02:17.720 --> 02:21.120
And of course, locally installed games, classic retro games.

02:21.120 --> 02:23.760
It's one of the best tools for gamers out there.

02:23.760 --> 02:27.400
And the developer of it will be joining us to discuss some of those issues a little bit

02:27.400 --> 02:28.680
in the show.

02:28.680 --> 02:31.040
But we have a lot more than that, too.

02:31.040 --> 02:36.760
We have a plethora of topics to get into, including some community news, some feedback,

02:36.760 --> 02:42.300
and of course, analysis provided by our crack team of virtual Lug members.

02:42.300 --> 02:43.840
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

02:43.840 --> 02:44.840
Hello, hello.

02:44.840 --> 02:45.840
Hello, hello.

02:45.840 --> 02:46.840
Hello, hello.

02:46.840 --> 02:47.840
Namaskaram.

02:47.840 --> 02:49.200
Hello, everybody.

02:49.200 --> 02:50.760
It's good to have you here.

02:50.760 --> 02:56.680
As we gather here, it's been a week since we found out that RMS was back on the board

02:56.680 --> 02:59.320
at the Free Software Foundation.

02:59.320 --> 03:01.920
And a lot of things have been written and said about this.

03:01.920 --> 03:08.920
I haven't seen this wave of both pushback and analysis and clickbait.

03:08.920 --> 03:12.440
I haven't seen this kind of thing in a long time.

03:12.440 --> 03:17.920
And so I don't think I have a lot more to say today, but I am very happy with our coverage

03:17.920 --> 03:20.920
on Linux Action News episode 182.

03:20.920 --> 03:24.800
So if you haven't heard that and you want to hear our take and analysis on the situation,

03:24.800 --> 03:26.360
go check out linuxactionnews.com.

03:26.360 --> 03:33.120
I think at a certain point, what I'm worried about is while there's still relevant discussion

03:33.120 --> 03:37.580
to be had here, it starts to look like a feeding frenzy.

03:37.580 --> 03:40.200
It becomes more of a gang up than analysis.

03:40.200 --> 03:45.040
So I want to give a tip of the hat also to the boys over at Late Night Linux, episode

03:45.040 --> 03:46.040
118.

03:46.040 --> 03:48.600
I think they did a really good discussion there.

03:48.600 --> 03:50.460
They handled that really well, I thought.

03:50.460 --> 03:53.060
They voiced both sides of the situation.

03:53.060 --> 03:56.120
They had a good discussion, and I wanted to compliment them.

03:56.120 --> 03:59.560
So go check out Late Night Linux 118 for that as well, if you're looking for a little more

03:59.560 --> 04:00.560
analysis.

04:00.560 --> 04:02.480
I think we'll leave it at that, really.

04:02.480 --> 04:03.560
I don't think I need to say much more.

04:03.560 --> 04:07.000
I'm a little disappointed that some in the Linux media just sort of skipped the story

04:07.000 --> 04:08.440
because it made them uncomfortable.

04:08.440 --> 04:09.980
Yeah, that's the name of this game.

04:09.980 --> 04:10.980
It comes up.

04:10.980 --> 04:14.480
And then you saw others who milked it for like everything they can.

04:14.480 --> 04:17.920
I appreciate it's a hard topic for our community to talk about.

04:17.920 --> 04:21.720
I don't think there's much more we can add, Wes, than we have now at this point.

04:21.720 --> 04:26.300
We had our initial, like we just found out about the news last week in this episode.

04:26.300 --> 04:31.480
And then in Linux Action News 182, we had an opportunity to kind of reflect on all of

04:31.480 --> 04:35.120
the open letters that had come out in the news coverage and sort of surmised our analysis

04:35.120 --> 04:36.120
of the situation.

04:36.120 --> 04:37.120
And I'm proud of that work we did there.

04:37.120 --> 04:40.220
And I think it stands on its own as a piece of our coverage.

04:40.220 --> 04:41.320
Any other thoughts that you have on it?

04:41.320 --> 04:42.320
Are you good with that?

04:42.320 --> 04:43.320
You agree?

04:43.320 --> 04:44.320
Yeah, I agree.

04:44.320 --> 04:49.400
I think we should just move right along because also in episode 182 of Linux Action News,

04:49.400 --> 04:54.800
we had a good chat with Neil McGovern, the executive director of the GNOME Foundation,

04:54.800 --> 04:59.760
discussed the design challenges, GTK4, and of course, all the great technical work being

04:59.760 --> 05:00.760
done on the shell.

05:00.760 --> 05:04.480
And I think that's what we should probably be more excited about today.

05:04.480 --> 05:05.480
Hear, hear.

05:05.480 --> 05:06.480
Hear, hear.

05:06.480 --> 05:07.480
Yeah.

05:07.480 --> 05:08.480
There we go.

05:08.480 --> 05:09.480
All right.

05:09.480 --> 05:10.480
Well, then let's talk about something new.

05:10.480 --> 05:11.480
Let's talk about...

05:11.480 --> 05:12.480
Oh, am I going to say this right?

05:12.480 --> 05:13.480
Alamo Linux.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.480
Is that right, Wes?

05:14.480 --> 05:15.480
Alamo Linux.

05:15.480 --> 05:17.040
It's officially stable today.

05:17.040 --> 05:22.400
They write, we are happy to announce we are releasing the first Alamo Linux OS stable

05:22.400 --> 05:23.680
version.

05:23.680 --> 05:29.000
And for those of you who don't remember, this is one of the first announced quote unquote

05:29.000 --> 05:31.960
replacements for traditional CentOS.

05:31.960 --> 05:36.760
They also announced the formation of a nonprofit that's going to take over responsibility for

05:36.760 --> 05:39.840
managing the Alamo Linux OS project.

05:39.840 --> 05:43.000
Also announced some of the board members that are going to steer that effort.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.720
So it looks like things are starting to really happen over there.

05:45.720 --> 05:46.720
Yeah.

05:46.720 --> 05:47.720
It's what?

05:47.720 --> 05:51.640
About four months since we got the news about the traditional release path for CentOS going

05:51.640 --> 05:53.480
away and then switching to stream.

05:53.480 --> 05:58.720
And now within that time period, we have a one to one binary compatible quote unquote

05:58.720 --> 05:59.720
drop in replacement.

05:59.720 --> 06:01.680
I haven't tested that yet.

06:01.680 --> 06:03.660
And they say with a very long support timeframe.

06:03.660 --> 06:07.540
So if you were wondering how long it would take someone out there to respond to those

06:07.540 --> 06:12.040
changes and actually ship something as a version 1.0, four months.

06:12.040 --> 06:13.040
There it is.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.040
Hats off to them.

06:14.040 --> 06:17.720
Yeah, now we just wait and see who uses it and how long it lasts, I guess.

06:17.720 --> 06:22.360
I'm not really sure what we qualify as success here, but this is great.

06:22.360 --> 06:23.360
It's great to see.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.360
And hopefully there's a lot of happy users out there.

06:25.360 --> 06:27.640
I think Rocky is getting really close as well.

06:27.640 --> 06:31.440
Rocky Linux is getting Nye, the final release of that one.

06:31.440 --> 06:32.520
And we'll have to cover that.

06:32.520 --> 06:34.760
I mean, at some point, I'd like to take a look at these.

06:34.760 --> 06:37.600
I don't know how you exactly do analysis.

06:37.600 --> 06:38.600
CentOS shootout.

06:38.600 --> 06:39.600
Yeah.

06:39.600 --> 06:44.880
Do you have any insight in how we could compare these these various CentOS clones and what

06:44.880 --> 06:47.120
what benchmarks even go by there?

06:47.120 --> 06:49.160
I'm not I'm not really clear on how to do this.

06:49.160 --> 06:54.480
I mean, if they're doing their mission correctly, you won't really be able to tell a difference.

06:54.480 --> 06:55.480
So right.

06:55.480 --> 06:57.260
I guess that is the benchmark, isn't it?

06:57.260 --> 07:01.880
Is if it feels like it's its own unique distro, they're doing it wrong.

07:01.880 --> 07:02.880
Exactly.

07:02.880 --> 07:06.280
Because with their stated goal of, you know, bug for bug compatibility, it gets to be even

07:06.280 --> 07:09.160
difficult to add any kind of features or fix any other bugs.

07:09.160 --> 07:11.340
It's not going to happen in those type of distros.

07:11.340 --> 07:15.100
They're made more for building on top of with some some kind of something equivalent to

07:15.100 --> 07:19.080
like the CentOS SIGs, which will be their own challenge to stand up.

07:19.080 --> 07:23.360
I'm both happy and pleased for them to see this.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.840
But I wonder if you feel like I do, Carl.

07:24.840 --> 07:29.160
I'm also a little like but we haven't even given stream a shot yet.

07:29.160 --> 07:31.720
I feel kind of like it hasn't gotten a chance to even prove itself.

07:31.720 --> 07:34.360
Well, I'm obviously biased there.

07:34.360 --> 07:37.800
So I don't know how much I can contribute on that.

07:37.800 --> 07:42.120
Other than we're definitely working hard on making stream eight good and stream nine's

07:42.120 --> 07:43.120
in the works.

07:43.120 --> 07:44.120
It's coming out pretty soon.

07:44.120 --> 07:48.840
I don't know that we've actually set a public ish date, but definitely very soon you'll

07:48.840 --> 07:50.460
see stream nine.

07:50.460 --> 07:53.800
And that'll be you know, what's planned to go into rail 9.0.

07:53.800 --> 07:57.560
And I'm hoping that you know, I'm hoping a lot more people give it a shot then because

07:57.560 --> 08:01.560
we'll have a lot more thing much modularity will be a lot more mature.

08:01.560 --> 08:05.200
Some of the other drawbacks we've had with eight are going to be taken care of like we're

08:05.200 --> 08:07.300
trying to make the entire build route available.

08:07.300 --> 08:10.420
There were some devil packages that were missing in stream eight that made a lot of things

08:10.420 --> 08:12.260
like Apple harder to do.

08:12.260 --> 08:17.020
So we're hoping to enable a lot more contributions and a lot more of the ecosystem with nine.

08:17.020 --> 08:18.840
It's the first stream of the new era.

08:18.840 --> 08:19.840
Right.

08:19.840 --> 08:23.440
This will be the first time where we're actually delivering on the mission stream eight's kind

08:23.440 --> 08:27.120
of a retrofit like, okay, well, it's going to be upstream.

08:27.120 --> 08:29.540
It's just still in progress to get upstream.

08:29.540 --> 08:32.980
We're still technically stream eight, we're still rebuilding it.

08:32.980 --> 08:35.640
I'm still doing a lot of those rebuilds myself.

08:35.640 --> 08:39.480
And they're still happening inside rail internally first.

08:39.480 --> 08:42.560
It's just they're getting delivered to the public as soon as we rebuild them rather than

08:42.560 --> 08:47.320
batching them all up into one big like CentOS 8.4 release.

08:47.320 --> 08:51.320
With stream nine, that's when we're actually going to be moving, finishing that process

08:51.320 --> 08:56.520
and having, I don't want to say finished, there'll still be things that can be improved,

08:56.520 --> 09:00.880
but it'll be a lot closer to the final vision of rail maintainers doing their builds and

09:00.880 --> 09:05.360
stream nine first, and then we compose and deliver those.

09:05.360 --> 09:08.000
We're doing weekly right now delivery of the updates.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.880
I don't know if we're going to keep that same cadence, but that's probably what people could

09:10.880 --> 09:11.880
expect initially.

09:11.880 --> 09:12.880
Okay.

09:12.880 --> 09:18.400
Neil, I'm curious if you feel like this means that CentOS stream has to compete even more

09:18.400 --> 09:21.320
aggressively with these other clones out there now.

09:21.320 --> 09:28.020
So I think that the CentOS stream effort that's going on now is going to be an interesting

09:28.020 --> 09:33.640
differentiator on itself because when you look at what CentOS stream nine is going to

09:33.640 --> 09:39.800
be, and if you do the right kind of digging and a little bit of the poking, you can kind

09:39.800 --> 09:44.900
of see that we're probably going to start seeing early builds and releases coming out

09:44.900 --> 09:49.600
in about two months.

09:49.600 --> 09:53.800
We'll fact check me in two months time and see if we've got that going.

09:53.800 --> 09:58.280
But I think what you're going to see is that people who are really into the enterprise

09:58.280 --> 10:06.920
space who have been kind of frustrated with how difficult it is to leverage RHEL or CentOS

10:06.920 --> 10:13.360
and be able to get things going and get things fixed, we'll find that CentOS stream will

10:13.360 --> 10:20.080
be a way for them to deal with those problems because one of the things that I have been

10:20.080 --> 10:25.360
conveyed as part of some of the work I do professionally that involves Red Hat Enterprise

10:25.360 --> 10:32.360
Linux is I'm being told I should just go push them into CentOS stream and they'll cherry

10:32.360 --> 10:36.920
pick them back if they need to be early, but then they'll be shipped right along with everything

10:36.920 --> 10:38.940
else into the next point release.

10:38.940 --> 10:44.000
So it gives an avenue in which people who are equipped to be able to do stuff to make

10:44.000 --> 10:51.280
it better for everyone actually have the ability to do it, engaging with Red Hat and engaging

10:51.280 --> 10:55.520
with the community and making a better enterprise Linux.

10:55.520 --> 10:56.520
I think that's awesome.

10:56.520 --> 11:01.240
I mean, I've already been doing the same in OpenSUSE Leap for three years now.

11:01.240 --> 11:04.460
And so it's nice to see this on the Red Hat side of things too.

11:04.460 --> 11:11.120
It's gotten to the point now where I can actually visualize the flow of it from Fedora onward.

11:11.120 --> 11:18.320
And the fundamental change now is that Stream is going to make RHEL a more openly developed

11:18.320 --> 11:19.900
operating system.

11:19.900 --> 11:24.960
And I think because of the scale of importance that RHEL has in the industry, that is a bigger

11:24.960 --> 11:28.840
win than we can appreciate right now while we are in the midst of the very beginning

11:28.840 --> 11:30.200
of the transition.

11:30.200 --> 11:36.400
But long term, like when we are in episode 500 territory, we'll look back and be grateful,

11:36.400 --> 11:40.680
I think, that RHEL's development is so much more open now.

11:40.680 --> 11:45.520
And people have insights what's actually going to land in RHEL and can plan and develop for

11:45.520 --> 11:46.520
it.

11:46.520 --> 11:50.120
I think it's going to make a huge difference, but I guess time will tell.

11:50.120 --> 11:52.600
We have a PSA for Ubuntu folks out there.

11:52.600 --> 11:56.360
Ubuntu 21.04 is testing soon, and they'd love to get your help.

11:56.360 --> 11:59.600
Now, they have specific things they're going to focus on.

11:59.600 --> 12:03.680
So I recommend you check the link in the show notes if you'd like to help them out.

12:03.680 --> 12:07.360
But it's coming up pretty soon, April 1st to April 7th.

12:07.360 --> 12:13.160
On April 1st, they'll release Ubuntu 21.04, and they'll halt changes, do some testing,

12:13.160 --> 12:17.520
and then hopefully incorporate what everybody finds during testing week.

12:17.520 --> 12:22.680
They have information and all that good stuff in a post that Popey made on the Ubuntu discourse

12:22.680 --> 12:23.680
site.

12:23.680 --> 12:25.200
So I'll have a link to that in the show notes.

12:25.200 --> 12:28.680
If you'd like to help them make the next release a little bit better, because this has the

12:28.680 --> 12:33.640
opportunity to kind of be a great desktop environment for folks who are not ready to

12:33.640 --> 12:38.800
take the plunge to 40 and want something really, really solid and just the latest and greatest

12:38.800 --> 12:40.280
of the GNOME 3 series.

12:40.280 --> 12:41.280
So go check that out.

12:41.280 --> 12:45.320
We'll have a link in the show notes and you can help them.

12:45.320 --> 12:47.920
Go help them, you know, go make it better.

12:47.920 --> 12:50.160
Go make it even better.

12:50.160 --> 12:54.180
And then next up in the show, this is an interesting one.

12:54.180 --> 13:01.520
So I had an opportunity to sit down with some of the folks behind shells.com about a week

13:01.520 --> 13:07.460
ago, just like an off-air conversation that we had, because they are, well, they're introducing

13:07.460 --> 13:11.240
something that seems like a pretty solid idea to me.

13:11.240 --> 13:13.120
Streaming is all the rage these days.

13:13.120 --> 13:19.280
I signed up for a GeForce Now streaming membership and every now and then I stream video games.

13:19.280 --> 13:22.640
And it kind of makes sense that Linux would be in on that game.

13:22.640 --> 13:24.400
So they're new.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.040
They're just kind of getting rolling.

13:26.040 --> 13:27.760
They're not a sponsor or anything like that.

13:27.760 --> 13:29.700
There's no relationship between them and JB.

13:29.700 --> 13:32.880
But I'm always curious how companies are using Linux.

13:32.880 --> 13:38.680
And then because I used to be an IT guy who built up systems, I always like to know, like

13:38.680 --> 13:41.760
as much as I can about the tech behind the scenes.

13:41.760 --> 13:44.560
And so the idea behind shells.com, if you haven't heard of it, probably haven't because

13:44.560 --> 13:49.520
it's pretty new, let's just stream a Linux desktop that you have root on via your browser.

13:49.520 --> 13:52.460
And they got lots of different distros, some distros they're working directly with who

13:52.460 --> 13:54.500
will basically answer their calls.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.800
So all of them that will.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.600
There's like, I played, did you get a chance to play with it, Wes?

13:57.600 --> 14:01.440
I played with an Ubuntu box, a Fedora box, messed around with it and thought it was pretty

14:01.440 --> 14:02.440
neat.

14:02.440 --> 14:03.440
Yeah.

14:03.440 --> 14:06.760
I mean, I didn't play with it a ton, but everything I tried, I was pretty impressed.

14:06.760 --> 14:08.120
Snappy worked right up.

14:08.120 --> 14:09.960
I mean, it felt like a real Linux box.

14:09.960 --> 14:10.960
Yeah.

14:10.960 --> 14:15.560
And it's interesting because they're not like running off of any other cloud infrastructure.

14:15.560 --> 14:19.800
They in the modern day, they're actually, they have their own data center, their own

14:19.800 --> 14:20.800
servers.

14:20.800 --> 14:23.380
It really seems like they have this infrastructure pretty far along.

14:23.380 --> 14:24.600
And I was curious why.

14:24.600 --> 14:28.160
And I suspect it's because they have ties to the people who found private internet access

14:28.160 --> 14:29.660
and even Mount Gox.

14:29.660 --> 14:34.080
So I chatted with their man behind the scenes who is building all this up on the tech side.

14:34.080 --> 14:36.120
So I'm Zlatan Todorich.

14:36.120 --> 14:41.280
If that name sounds familiar to you, that's because you might recall he was the CTO at

14:41.280 --> 14:44.060
Purism in a past life.

14:44.060 --> 14:49.620
So we started things off by asking why he left Purism and how he ended up at shells.com.

14:49.620 --> 14:52.200
I think our audience might recall your name.

14:52.200 --> 14:58.680
It might sound familiar because it was October 20th, 2019 that Michael Arbrol posted an interview

14:58.680 --> 15:03.220
with you at Ferronix where you expressed some concerns around Purism.

15:03.220 --> 15:09.180
So how do we go, just short version, how do we go from leaving Purism to working at shells.com

15:09.180 --> 15:10.880
and building their tech infrastructure?

15:10.880 --> 15:14.440
Well, it was, I guess, more like part of a community.

15:14.440 --> 15:23.080
So I left Purism because I disagreed with the direction it chose to go forward.

15:23.080 --> 15:32.680
And I ended up in shells because they basically contacted KDE community and people from KDE

15:32.680 --> 15:36.080
contacted me and they needed a systems engineer.

15:36.080 --> 15:43.560
And from there on, I became a systems engineer, project manager, product manager, and probably

15:43.560 --> 15:47.880
some few more titles in there.

15:47.880 --> 15:48.880
It's startup.

15:48.880 --> 15:50.880
So everybody is having like five jobs.

15:50.880 --> 15:53.480
Yeah, I know that one.

15:53.480 --> 15:56.000
It just seems super ambitious.

15:56.000 --> 16:01.720
So the elevator pitch for the audience that's listening and feel free to jump in is it's

16:01.720 --> 16:08.080
a way to get a full Linux desktop shell in your web browser or on mobile using the app.

16:08.080 --> 16:12.400
And if you're a student or a worker or a developer or creator and you need access to a Linux

16:12.400 --> 16:17.360
desktop and one that will persist as well, so you can disconnect and reconnect and that

16:17.360 --> 16:22.400
environment still exists and you can install software and you get admin access.

16:22.400 --> 16:24.960
That's what shells.com is trying to do.

16:24.960 --> 16:31.280
But functionally, that means you're spinning up VMs and creating VMs and allocating IPs

16:31.280 --> 16:32.960
and all kinds of stuff on the back end.

16:32.960 --> 16:37.520
And there's not like a package, as far as I know, that you can just install and we'll

16:37.520 --> 16:38.720
do that for you.

16:38.720 --> 16:44.840
So no, we basically use open source tech and leverage that.

16:44.840 --> 16:52.880
So we use QEMU and we use Pyke protocol to basically show in browsers.

16:52.880 --> 16:59.840
And we have our own things going on in the back end to make all that smooth process.

16:59.840 --> 17:04.800
And as you said, currently, we have a couple of Linux distros, we work with more, we also

17:04.800 --> 17:10.880
plan to offer Windows, Android, and who knows what future brings for us.

17:10.880 --> 17:15.960
It seems like you must have done something to make the Spice experience feel a little

17:15.960 --> 17:16.960
quicker.

17:16.960 --> 17:18.760
It feels faster than VNC to me.

17:18.760 --> 17:23.760
Yeah, I mean, Spice has already integrated its own protocols.

17:23.760 --> 17:30.700
And we use the servers, a strong service back, so it's a lot of hardware power behind.

17:30.700 --> 17:33.400
But we also have fast networks.

17:33.400 --> 17:37.400
And we do require a bit that you have on your side as well, fast networks.

17:37.400 --> 17:40.760
So it does have that huge latency.

17:40.760 --> 17:47.040
And we have our own data centers, and we try to actually move data quite fast.

17:47.040 --> 17:53.520
And we use the Ceph as an object storage behind to make sure everything is kept in place,

17:53.520 --> 17:58.080
it doesn't break every day and loses user data.

17:58.080 --> 18:01.280
Can we talk just for a second before you go too much further, can we talk about the centralized

18:01.280 --> 18:02.280
storage?

18:02.280 --> 18:03.280
I'm curious how you've built that here.

18:03.280 --> 18:07.360
So I got a little bit of insight there, sounds like you're using Cephs to manage some of

18:07.360 --> 18:08.360
this.

18:08.360 --> 18:09.960
Can you break some of that down for us?

18:09.960 --> 18:15.440
Well, there's nothing special we use, again, basically what Ceph is, you know, giving us

18:15.440 --> 18:19.560
and we just deploy it on all our servers.

18:19.560 --> 18:22.600
And we make it sure that we have backups.

18:22.600 --> 18:29.360
And you know, Ceph is good for basically keeping data uncorrupted and moving a lot of data

18:29.360 --> 18:35.960
around because again, serving desktop is quite a bit of data that needs to be moved around

18:35.960 --> 18:38.080
and especially the three plan.

18:38.080 --> 18:39.380
How are the data centers connected?

18:39.380 --> 18:41.520
Is it like a VPN over the public internet?

18:41.520 --> 18:44.440
Have you guys wired the data centers directly together because that seems like a ton of

18:44.440 --> 18:45.440
data to move around?

18:45.440 --> 18:52.680
Yeah, so we wired them and it's our own data centers with our own servers and basically

18:52.680 --> 19:00.060
try to have everything in one place and to maintain by ourselves so we don't rent anything

19:00.060 --> 19:04.960
from Amazon or DigitalOcean or what's the usual aspect for that.

19:04.960 --> 19:11.320
We really try to keep everything in-house because again, Shell was founded by founders

19:11.320 --> 19:15.660
of PIA and they really care for the privacy and security.

19:15.660 --> 19:22.120
So instead of relying on others, we're actually working hard to have everything in-house and

19:22.120 --> 19:25.480
make it as private and secure as possible.

19:25.480 --> 19:30.000
It sounds like there's been some lessons, perhaps maybe from running PIA that were learned,

19:30.000 --> 19:34.080
lessons you learned, just going into this, you're kind of building it the way you would

19:34.080 --> 19:38.720
want to build it after building something that's just quick and cheap and then having

19:38.720 --> 19:39.720
to tear it down and rebuild.

19:39.720 --> 19:42.840
It sounds like you just went right to the rebuild, this is what you'd want to build

19:42.840 --> 19:43.840
if you could stage.

19:43.840 --> 19:44.840
Yeah.

19:44.840 --> 19:50.840
So we are really trying, we never have a decision to make a decision that's going to be long-term

19:50.840 --> 19:57.680
because we have the resources to pull that out and we are still, of course, learning

19:57.680 --> 20:04.120
along our way but there is no slacking or there's no like a quick road to anything.

20:04.120 --> 20:07.320
We are trying to make a stable product from day one.

20:07.320 --> 20:12.560
So we spend a lot of time during the day, most actual of our time during the day debugging

20:12.560 --> 20:19.520
things, making them work together, having the transitions go smooth so users don't see

20:19.520 --> 20:26.440
anything happening in their shells, which is a really good achievement because we daily

20:26.440 --> 20:32.240
send things to the production and we try to avoid as much breakage as we can.

20:32.240 --> 20:35.240
But sometimes we break things but we are quick to fix.

20:35.240 --> 20:38.160
What are we using underneath the user experience?

20:38.160 --> 20:41.560
What Linux distro and kind of technology are you using to push things around?

20:41.560 --> 20:47.260
The kernel that's powering all shells is the Gentoo one.

20:47.260 --> 20:50.520
So it's pretty upstream agnostic.

20:50.520 --> 20:57.160
It's very close to upstream and we use the latest one but we actually do offer to distros

20:57.160 --> 21:02.520
and we collaborate with some of them like OpenSUSE and Fedora, they expressed desire

21:02.520 --> 21:08.400
to have their own kernel to actually run the entire experience and we do offer that as

21:08.400 --> 21:09.400
well.

21:09.400 --> 21:14.880
But again, then in that case the distros themselves didn't provide the kernel, they didn't provide

21:14.880 --> 21:21.920
the bootloader, didn't provide the disk resize tools, obviously, or you have the other way

21:21.920 --> 21:26.840
going with our kernel and we already have automated the disk resize in it.

21:26.840 --> 21:29.840
It's pretty nice though that the distros are giving you that feedback.

21:29.840 --> 21:33.200
It sounds like you guys have talked to a lot of them and some of them have said it could

21:33.200 --> 21:35.840
be even better if you tweaked a few things.

21:35.840 --> 21:40.440
So you've got to build a system that can accommodate hosting servers in your data center running

21:40.440 --> 21:45.480
say a Fedora kernel and a Gentoo kernel for a different system.

21:45.480 --> 21:49.960
It sounds like there must be some glue that helps you manage all of this.

21:49.960 --> 21:58.000
We have like most of the scripts for the systems, we actually open source them and we invite

21:58.000 --> 22:03.480
the distros to collaborate on our GitHub repo, basically giving their own scripts how to

22:03.480 --> 22:04.480
build them.

22:04.480 --> 22:09.840
But yeah, we have a couple of scripts for managing all the data centers, including everything

22:09.840 --> 22:12.940
we have them currently internally.

22:12.940 --> 22:17.240
So they are not currently open source, but we do plan to open source them in the future.

22:17.240 --> 22:24.840
It's just that we are working at a high pace and currently we don't have like a super usable

22:24.840 --> 22:28.720
finished product for people to just build a top on it.

22:28.720 --> 22:33.280
But it's going to be there, like we're going to open source more and more things eventually.

22:33.280 --> 22:38.800
I set myself up a couple of, I set up a Fedora workstation shell and I also tried out the

22:38.800 --> 22:42.120
Ubuntu 2004 experience.

22:42.120 --> 22:43.120
And it's pretty cool.

22:43.120 --> 22:49.040
It seems like it really is becoming the era of streaming desktops and streaming games.

22:49.040 --> 22:53.240
And I wonder since you've been under the hood for a little bit, is there any tweaks?

22:53.240 --> 22:57.120
Like if you could wave a magic wand and all of a sudden have development effort in Linux

22:57.120 --> 23:01.320
directed at something, is there any new code or tweaks that you would wish for to make

23:01.320 --> 23:04.640
this even better for what shells.com is trying to do?

23:04.640 --> 23:10.860
There's like some latency, I guess, like issues that we see from time to time.

23:10.860 --> 23:17.040
And we're probably going to try to improve the spice protocol and upstream, those things.

23:17.040 --> 23:19.380
And of course there's the input.

23:19.380 --> 23:23.800
We need to make it sure that once you plug your USB, that it's going to be right inside

23:23.800 --> 23:24.800
the shells.

23:24.800 --> 23:29.460
And some people expressed, they want to do that and have printing capabilities because

23:29.460 --> 23:31.640
that's like an enterprise solution.

23:31.640 --> 23:38.840
So what we need to tweak and work on those, I would say minor, maybe not medium hard things,

23:38.840 --> 23:44.480
but there's nothing too much special now that I would really change about it.

23:44.480 --> 23:47.760
Just refinements and improving things to make it work even better.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.720
Especially with Spice.

23:49.720 --> 23:56.120
Spice is going to have some changes, but mostly it's basically default tweaking, the same

23:56.120 --> 23:58.440
with QEMU.

23:58.440 --> 24:04.280
And for example, now we don't have GPUs in our data centers, but we do plan in the future

24:04.280 --> 24:05.280
to have that.

24:05.280 --> 24:10.760
And that's going to bring us another option, the VirGL option to basically pass through

24:10.760 --> 24:15.680
directly to GPU, which is going to increase the performance a lot.

24:15.680 --> 24:20.160
It can be literally in hundreds and even thousands of times the performance can rise because

24:20.160 --> 24:25.160
most of the desktop nowadays, they have the graphical acceleration, compositing, and same

24:25.160 --> 24:26.520
goes for the browsers.

24:26.520 --> 24:30.780
YouTube needs hardware acceleration to properly push that through.

24:30.780 --> 24:36.640
And so some things are hardware specific and some are software specific that we're going

24:36.640 --> 24:38.520
to tune through the time.

24:38.520 --> 24:46.480
But on bright side, Linux institutions work really well through Spice and through QEMU

24:46.480 --> 24:53.220
and the entire work done by community on that side is absolutely stunning and incredible.

24:53.220 --> 24:55.760
And we're just building on top of it.

24:55.760 --> 25:02.440
It's again, the power of the open source is coming to its own height.

25:02.440 --> 25:04.120
lino.com slash unplugged.

25:04.120 --> 25:08.520
Go there to get a $100 60 day credit and support the show.

25:08.520 --> 25:09.520
I just love it.

25:09.520 --> 25:13.760
You know, here we are, an independent podcast, almost a 400 episodes.

25:13.760 --> 25:16.980
And one of the things that makes it possible is the audience trusting that we work with

25:16.980 --> 25:19.440
great sponsors and trying them.

25:19.440 --> 25:21.480
And Linode, it can solve some problems.

25:21.480 --> 25:25.080
If you're prototyping, if you're learning, or if you just want to host something for

25:25.080 --> 25:30.400
yourself or for the public, Linode has different machines at different price points that you're

25:30.400 --> 25:31.720
going to be impressed by.

25:31.720 --> 25:35.780
It's 30 to 50 percent less than AWS or Azure.

25:35.780 --> 25:40.160
And personally, one of the things I love about Linode is they have all the distros.

25:40.160 --> 25:45.360
And the reason why I love that is it's a great opportunity to learn and test or just host

25:45.360 --> 25:47.840
the disk with on the distro that you prefer, I suppose.

25:47.840 --> 25:50.240
I mean, that seems like the obvious one.

25:50.240 --> 25:56.320
I even found a how to online on how to using Linux actually load Windows.

25:56.320 --> 25:57.680
People want Windows on the nodes, too.

25:57.680 --> 26:01.540
I mean, that's because the Linode hardware is really good.

26:01.540 --> 26:04.760
You can go get Windows VPS somewhere, right?

26:04.760 --> 26:07.340
But Linode does more than just the average bear.

26:07.340 --> 26:13.080
They have fast disks and network and a great interface and 11 data centers to choose from.

26:13.080 --> 26:16.920
They've really dialed this thing in because they've been around since 2003.

26:16.920 --> 26:20.640
And now they're dedicated to the best virtualized cloud computing.

26:20.640 --> 26:24.400
They're independently owned and founded on a love for Linux and open source technologies.

26:24.400 --> 26:27.760
They support this here show and other others in the Linux media space.

26:27.760 --> 26:31.680
And of course, projects that we love like Kabuntu and events like All Things Open and

26:31.680 --> 26:35.680
Linux Fest Northwest, which gives them a real special place in my heart.

26:35.680 --> 26:39.720
And the fact that they're Linux nerds, well, isn't that just the icing on the cake?

26:39.720 --> 26:42.360
So go support the show and see what I've been talking about.

26:42.360 --> 26:48.840
Try them out, linode.com slash unplugged.

26:48.840 --> 26:55.560
Well Mr. Payne, why don't we talk about something that is a bit aux, you know what I mean?

26:55.560 --> 26:58.520
It's time to broach this subject, I think.

26:58.520 --> 27:05.220
I think what gets me about it is it's easy to feel guilty like we're part of the problem.

27:05.220 --> 27:10.720
So what we're going to try to talk about today through the lens of the Lutris project is

27:10.720 --> 27:17.380
an overwhelming problem that seems to be facing independent open source developers who have

27:17.380 --> 27:22.000
to balance life and time and community and bug fixes.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.560
Matthew's dedicated the last 10 years to building Lutris.

27:24.560 --> 27:29.640
He's adjusted his work schedule to go part time so he has time for the project and also

27:29.640 --> 27:30.640
time for himself.

27:30.640 --> 27:34.680
I mean, also, just trying to take care of yourself is a hard thing to balance.

27:34.680 --> 27:38.000
It's not really even a hobby anymore at that point, I mean, gosh.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
Yeah.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.920
And we've talked to developers off air, but not a lot of developers have wanted to say

27:42.920 --> 27:45.880
what he's going to say on air.

27:45.880 --> 27:48.860
We do see this discussion happening a lot.

27:48.860 --> 27:51.520
And I know it's uncomfortable for us end users.

27:51.520 --> 27:55.320
So we just kind of have to listen and maybe we can come up as a community, just maybe

27:55.320 --> 27:59.320
some ideas or solutions to address some of these concerns that he'll raise.

27:59.320 --> 28:06.340
It seems like there is some kind of change that is in the winds and our chat with Matthew

28:06.340 --> 28:10.800
gives us insights into some of the longer term challenges specifically around these

28:10.800 --> 28:11.800
complex applications.

28:11.800 --> 28:15.080
Well, Matthew, thank you for joining me on the show today.

28:15.080 --> 28:21.440
You did a blog post on the 20th of March titled Not on the Same Page, and it's sort of a

28:21.440 --> 28:24.720
reflection of your 15 year journey in Linux.

28:24.720 --> 28:30.040
You are the founder of Lutris, which is one of my absolute favorite desktop Linux apps.

28:30.040 --> 28:35.680
Do you have a elevator pitch to the audience who might not be familiar with who or what

28:35.680 --> 28:36.680
Lutris is?

28:36.680 --> 28:39.920
Well, I call it a video game preservation platform now.

28:39.920 --> 28:47.480
I used to call it an open platform for Linux and recently I've decided to change the main

28:47.480 --> 28:53.120
focus of the project and to make it clear that it's a project that is here to preserve

28:53.120 --> 28:56.280
video games, to make them run locally on your machine.

28:56.280 --> 29:01.640
So the goal is really to make run any type of video games, regardless of their platform.

29:01.640 --> 29:07.500
It can be old consoles, old computers, or like really modern games as well.

29:07.500 --> 29:11.580
And one place to just manage all of that and try to make it as approachable as possible,

29:11.580 --> 29:14.660
which is obvious why I love the project.

29:14.660 --> 29:18.160
You must have known trying to build something like this, especially targeting the Linux

29:18.160 --> 29:22.360
desktop before you even started, was going to be an uphill battle.

29:22.360 --> 29:31.560
I knew that in some ways because the way I wanted to approach Lutris was not the traditional

29:31.560 --> 29:36.400
way of running things, but also I had some ideas.

29:36.400 --> 29:44.080
I wanted to gather some, let's say some development team or just a team to work with, and I thought

29:44.080 --> 29:49.880
that I would start an open source project and some people would jump into the project

29:49.880 --> 29:53.680
and I was just getting started at the time and wasn't actually the best programmer or

29:53.680 --> 29:54.680
anything.

29:54.680 --> 29:56.120
You thought if you built it though, they would come?

29:56.120 --> 29:57.120
Yeah.

29:57.120 --> 29:58.120
Yeah.

29:58.120 --> 30:01.080
I thought that, yeah, I just have to start something and someone will say, oh, this looks

30:01.080 --> 30:02.080
great.

30:02.080 --> 30:03.080
So I'll come and help you.

30:03.080 --> 30:04.080
Well, the users arrived.

30:04.080 --> 30:05.080
Yeah.

30:05.080 --> 30:10.680
The users, yes, but not really, and also some people who helped with the code really, I

30:10.680 --> 30:16.120
don't want to say I haven't had any contributors because that wouldn't be true, but some team

30:16.120 --> 30:20.520
members do work on the project who would be on the same page, like I said.

30:20.520 --> 30:24.600
But as the project goes on, it sounds like the disconnect that you felt between what

30:24.600 --> 30:30.440
you have in mind, what the goals are for the project and what Linux users are asking for,

30:30.440 --> 30:37.160
and it sounds like a core tenet of Linux users is this desire to tweak their system and make

30:37.160 --> 30:40.020
it their own, customize it the way they like it.

30:40.020 --> 30:44.120
That's something the community, I think you say, and I agree with, takes pride in doing,

30:44.120 --> 30:50.080
but that is ultimately kind of creating an always moving target for you, I would imagine.

30:50.080 --> 30:53.560
That's something that's on top of the open source aspect of the project.

30:53.560 --> 30:59.400
That's just working on Linux and that would also happen if the program was proprietary

30:59.400 --> 31:00.400
like Steam.

31:00.400 --> 31:06.200
Steam faces the same issues like when they want to run games on Linux, they have to work

31:06.200 --> 31:12.800
on this platform, which is so broad and what you can do with it that you have to target

31:12.800 --> 31:17.280
something to ship on and that thing is moving all the time, like you said.

31:17.280 --> 31:21.040
You could describe it as a volatile environment to develop for.

31:21.040 --> 31:24.080
You write on here, if your goal is to have a system that is about choice, then you've

31:24.080 --> 31:28.880
made the choice to not give me or other developers a stable foundation to build upon.

31:28.880 --> 31:32.920
I might not 100% agree with that, but I have absolutely heard that sentiment 100 times

31:32.920 --> 31:35.160
over from other developers I've talked to.

31:35.160 --> 31:40.640
Yeah, I don't want to say that Linux is not stable because I have software that is closed

31:40.640 --> 31:46.880
source and that will run on Linux pretty easily.

31:46.880 --> 31:50.320
Compatibility is good if you are doing the right thing.

31:50.320 --> 31:54.540
If you're choosing the right libraries and you're compiling just rights, then your program

31:54.540 --> 32:02.700
might keep working in the long run and Lutris interacts a lot with a lot of the other components

32:02.700 --> 32:03.700
of the system.

32:03.700 --> 32:09.880
A video game is just its own program, just shows up a 3D window and it's done, but Lutris

32:09.880 --> 32:15.920
is all interacting with all these other components on the system, so it has to play friendly.

32:15.920 --> 32:24.360
It has to have a good idea on what's going on, and that's not always easy to achieve

32:24.360 --> 32:29.600
to have this situation or you have control of what you're running.

32:29.600 --> 32:34.040
It's not like you're trying to support some open source command line application inside

32:34.040 --> 32:35.040
Lutris.

32:35.040 --> 32:40.520
You're trying to support a complex game that's using God knows what 3D and audio libraries

32:40.520 --> 32:42.080
from God knows when.

32:42.080 --> 32:47.680
Actually, the development I'm doing right now in Lutris is to support command line applications,

32:47.680 --> 32:48.680
but yes.

32:48.680 --> 32:49.680
Oh, really?

32:49.680 --> 32:50.680
That's hilarious.

32:50.680 --> 32:51.680
Well, good for you.

32:51.680 --> 32:53.400
That might be nice for a while.

32:53.400 --> 32:58.040
It's also in order to build a feature that will be used for Steam and everything, so

32:58.040 --> 33:04.440
it's not only for command line, but it's a starting point for some other things.

33:04.440 --> 33:12.120
It has to be in this ecosystem that works great locally on my setup, and then someone

33:12.120 --> 33:15.120
tries it and they have those weirdest issues.

33:15.120 --> 33:19.800
If I knew how to produce issues, usually they don't take long to solve.

33:19.800 --> 33:23.640
What weird thing did they do that I would have to replicate to reproduce the problem?

33:23.640 --> 33:27.360
What it sounds like you're describing is why containers have become so popular in the server

33:27.360 --> 33:31.360
space, because it sort of smooths this problem out.

33:31.360 --> 33:35.540
There are some efforts regarding containers, including one that I've made that's using

33:35.540 --> 33:36.540
the Docker.

33:36.540 --> 33:43.160
I've made it so it would run all low-key games like Soldier of Fortune or SimCity, but the

33:43.160 --> 33:48.640
problem is that it doesn't play nice with what's installed locally, like the graphics

33:48.640 --> 33:54.620
drivers or the sound card or all those things.

33:54.620 --> 33:56.880
There's something I have an idea for that.

33:56.880 --> 34:02.480
I'm not sure it's technically feasible, because it's really just an idea at this point.

34:02.480 --> 34:08.040
It's like on paper, it's like no code, no prototype, nothing, but something that would

34:08.040 --> 34:15.080
more or less do what Wine is doing, but for Linux, and that would say, okay, you want

34:15.080 --> 34:19.640
to run this game, but you run this game in this section of this window, because this

34:19.640 --> 34:25.760
is also to address some of the problems with Wayland rights, because Wayland gets rid of

34:25.760 --> 34:28.760
all the screen coordinates.

34:28.760 --> 34:32.680
So you run a game and the game doesn't know where to put itself.

34:32.680 --> 34:33.960
And same with sound cards.

34:33.960 --> 34:38.640
Sometimes you have a sound coming out of a TV and you would like it from your headphones

34:38.640 --> 34:44.240
and it gets mixed up and everything, and you have games with also a game with false audio.

34:44.240 --> 34:45.240
It gets messy.

34:45.240 --> 34:51.280
So if you had some way of sending the game where you want it to, and that can be a portion

34:51.280 --> 34:56.680
of the screen, that could be a full screen, that could be two screens, like a big window

34:56.680 --> 35:01.580
that spans two screens, or three, I don't know, any number of screens.

35:01.580 --> 35:07.840
If you give the game only the sound card you want to use, or if you want to give it only

35:07.840 --> 35:11.640
the joysticks you want it to use, then that would solve a lot of problems.

35:11.640 --> 35:14.280
And that's something I would like to give it a go.

35:14.280 --> 35:18.680
That's not something I can do technically, because I'm not good enough.

35:18.680 --> 35:19.920
It's a fantastic idea.

35:19.920 --> 35:23.780
And it kind of is, kind of going back to a point you were making earlier, is it kind

35:23.780 --> 35:26.000
of comes down to developer resources.

35:26.000 --> 35:29.680
The theme we see here is that Lutris has gotten really popular.

35:29.680 --> 35:36.060
It's like, it is, I think, a critical part of a Linux gamers set of tools.

35:36.060 --> 35:40.440
And it has a very loyal user base, but it hasn't really scaled up development wise.

35:40.440 --> 35:45.320
And in part, that means that you are inundated with tons of issues, you and many other developers.

35:45.320 --> 35:51.240
I wonder if this isn't a tooling problem, Matthew, because I talked to other developers

35:51.240 --> 35:57.560
who have just turned off notifications of new issues and requests, because they just

35:57.560 --> 36:00.480
simply don't have the email bandwidth to manage it.

36:00.480 --> 36:03.320
And they're just going to be working on what they have time to work on anyways.

36:03.320 --> 36:07.600
And it kind of makes the whole bug submission process moot.

36:07.600 --> 36:11.040
And it leaves end users expecting that something's going to get fixed.

36:11.040 --> 36:14.660
And it creates this weird tension between developer and user.

36:14.660 --> 36:17.840
And I'm curious if you have thoughts on how we could fix this problem.

36:17.840 --> 36:22.720
Because from your blog, I grok that this is an issue for you, and everybody else I talked

36:22.720 --> 36:23.920
to in this space.

36:23.920 --> 36:24.920
Is it a tooling problem?

36:24.920 --> 36:26.720
Is it a people problem?

36:26.720 --> 36:28.920
It's a problem with expectations, I think.

36:28.920 --> 36:30.160
This is very common.

36:30.160 --> 36:32.920
It's not only with issues.

36:32.920 --> 36:34.840
Issues is something that's raised quite a lot.

36:34.840 --> 36:38.880
But also, pull requests is also very time consuming.

36:38.880 --> 36:41.840
And it can be worse in some ways than issues.

36:41.840 --> 36:45.440
Because issues, I mean, you just respond and you get on with it.

36:45.440 --> 36:51.240
And if you don't have the time to work on it, then, I mean, that's too bad, but you

36:51.240 --> 36:52.240
can go on.

36:52.240 --> 36:56.320
With pull requests, I mean, either it's something you're not you don't want.

36:56.320 --> 37:00.300
And then you have to say, well, no, that's not something we want for the project.

37:00.300 --> 37:04.840
Or something you want, but it's not it doesn't fit well.

37:04.840 --> 37:11.280
Or it doesn't fit the code standards or all the stuff that's around the project.

37:11.280 --> 37:16.840
Or it uses some code variation that will break the project on various platforms.

37:16.840 --> 37:17.840
Right.

37:17.840 --> 37:18.840
So you can't just go with it.

37:18.840 --> 37:21.840
And if you were going to import it, it would take hours of refactoring.

37:21.840 --> 37:22.840
Yeah.

37:22.840 --> 37:27.960
And I was doing that at some point earlier, like a few years ago, where I would just welcome

37:27.960 --> 37:30.040
everything and say, yeah, you helped the project.

37:30.040 --> 37:31.040
That's great.

37:31.040 --> 37:33.040
And it would just hit merge.

37:33.040 --> 37:35.340
And then weeks would pass.

37:35.340 --> 37:39.960
And sometimes a bug would sneak in and would not see it.

37:39.960 --> 37:46.160
And then I would ship the program with some broken stuff because I didn't test the PR

37:46.160 --> 37:48.200
enough or didn't review it enough.

37:48.200 --> 37:52.240
And some PR contains some really broken stuff.

37:52.240 --> 37:54.560
And that has happened a few times.

37:54.560 --> 37:57.440
And it happens enough that you have to always be vigilant for it.

37:57.440 --> 38:01.400
I talked to a developer last week who said, even though he has an open source project,

38:01.400 --> 38:05.840
he just sort of has an unofficial policy that he's not going to accept any future merge

38:05.840 --> 38:06.840
requests.

38:06.840 --> 38:10.880
And then if he likes it, he'll rewrite it himself and do it that way.

38:10.880 --> 38:11.880
Yeah.

38:11.880 --> 38:13.360
I've done that a lot.

38:13.360 --> 38:19.140
Either just saying, no, I don't want this proof request, but then writing my own version

38:19.140 --> 38:24.760
of it or merging it and then rewriting on top of it.

38:24.760 --> 38:25.760
Yeah.

38:25.760 --> 38:27.400
That's something that's frequent.

38:27.400 --> 38:33.200
And I think that's mostly because this doesn't happen like in companies, like when you work

38:33.200 --> 38:35.920
in a company or a project, this doesn't happen.

38:35.920 --> 38:37.220
This is an open source problem.

38:37.220 --> 38:41.880
And I think in a way, GitHub and its UI have kind of encouraged this issue.

38:41.880 --> 38:42.880
They've made it worse.

38:42.880 --> 38:43.880
Yeah.

38:43.880 --> 38:48.760
But this is open source, but also open source on a one-man team project because you have

38:48.760 --> 38:53.600
like Mozilla, you have like big projects that have like a real team on it.

38:53.600 --> 38:54.600
Staff.

38:54.600 --> 38:55.600
Yeah.

38:55.600 --> 38:56.600
And you don't have those problems.

38:56.600 --> 38:59.680
You have like a real workflow that you would see in an enterprise.

38:59.680 --> 39:03.440
And because everyone is on the same team, they share the same coding standards.

39:03.440 --> 39:08.160
They have like the same goals and key results that they have to hit.

39:08.160 --> 39:09.160
Yeah.

39:09.160 --> 39:16.080
And this is something, so I went back and ran into some of the things that were in the

39:16.080 --> 39:24.880
cathedral and the bazaar and some of its rebuttal, mostly not the article itself of the cat B,

39:24.880 --> 39:27.880
but more of the articles that followed it.

39:27.880 --> 39:28.880
Interesting.

39:28.880 --> 39:29.880
Good idea.

39:29.880 --> 39:38.520
One of them is in the Wikipedia page for cat B. And it was written more than 20 years ago.

39:38.520 --> 39:44.200
It was written in 1999, just after cat B was released.

39:44.200 --> 39:50.880
And it raises a lot of important issues that are really valid today.

39:50.880 --> 39:57.640
And about this like tribalism or cult of personality and all this stuff, and also not having the

39:57.640 --> 40:03.120
bandwidth to work on issues and the fact that open source can slow down a developer instead

40:03.120 --> 40:04.680
of speed up and all those things.

40:04.680 --> 40:10.680
And I was like, oh wow, this is really old, but also really accurate in how things work

40:10.680 --> 40:12.280
even today.

40:12.280 --> 40:20.880
And yeah, I shouldn't have, I had some expectations that open source would bring some help into

40:20.880 --> 40:26.520
the development and help me really speed up the development, but it's really clear now

40:26.520 --> 40:31.720
that you work on something on your own, like it's kind of closed source, but it doesn't

40:31.720 --> 40:32.720
have to be.

40:32.720 --> 40:36.420
At some point, it's just like it exists just on your computer because you're the only one

40:36.420 --> 40:38.280
who's aware of it.

40:38.280 --> 40:43.320
If you release something and you make it open, then that's not going to speed up anything.

40:43.320 --> 40:47.000
That's just going to make it visible to people.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
So people will be able to-

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
Yeah.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
It speeds up adoption, essentially.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.800
It gets it included in distribution repositories.

40:52.800 --> 40:53.800
Yeah.

40:53.800 --> 40:59.220
And if it's good and if it's stable enough to be used, then adoption will grow.

40:59.220 --> 41:03.780
But it doesn't necessarily guarantee a development team will form or that the tooling around

41:03.780 --> 41:07.440
the support process will be comprehensive.

41:07.440 --> 41:11.120
It's like a land of promise, but then you get there and it turns out there's a lot of

41:11.120 --> 41:12.400
negatives and positives.

41:12.400 --> 41:14.920
And I'm wondering what your thoughts are on that.

41:14.920 --> 41:19.320
It doesn't put you in a place where you can build and design great things.

41:19.320 --> 41:22.320
So you can support your software, you can debug it.

41:22.320 --> 41:28.800
And it's true because I've found that it was the case that it's good to have this open

41:28.800 --> 41:35.280
source environment when I'm in QA stage, when I've done a bunch of work and I say, okay,

41:35.280 --> 41:37.640
I've done this, please test it.

41:37.640 --> 41:43.920
And sometimes there's not even enough testing because I release those betas or release candidates

41:43.920 --> 41:45.440
and I say, okay, test it.

41:45.440 --> 41:51.540
And there is some testing, there are a lot of bug reports and it goes well and it's fast

41:51.540 --> 41:59.320
and there's a lot of feedback and that's also citizen open source work really great.

41:59.320 --> 42:05.160
And then we have this situation where we are now where we're just after release and I want

42:05.160 --> 42:12.480
to have a lot of new stuff that's either rewriting some previous code or just brand new code

42:12.480 --> 42:17.760
that's never been done before that creates value added for the project.

42:17.760 --> 42:18.760
Right.

42:18.760 --> 42:20.240
The kind of features you get excited to work on.

42:20.240 --> 42:22.040
Yeah, the fun stuff.

42:22.040 --> 42:23.160
This is fun stuff.

42:23.160 --> 42:28.360
This is stuff that will bring value to the program that doesn't exist yet.

42:28.360 --> 42:34.280
This is stuff that has been promised on Patreon or to donors.

42:34.280 --> 42:40.040
All those new features, that's where it blocks, that's where I want to get the project working

42:40.040 --> 42:47.080
and then it's no because of those PRs and people also come and complain about the state

42:47.080 --> 42:52.800
of the current projects and say, oh, this doesn't work right, the UI doesn't work right.

42:52.800 --> 42:59.340
And they say, yeah, okay, but this is not really finished, I've shipped what I could

42:59.340 --> 43:00.340
do with it.

43:00.340 --> 43:03.400
It's in a working form while you focus on other features.

43:03.400 --> 43:08.540
And I want to change it, I don't want to keep it that way, but also I don't want to bring

43:08.540 --> 43:13.680
back the old stuff, I don't want to regress.

43:13.680 --> 43:18.200
I want to keep moving forward, but some people, they just say, oh, this is bad, I just want

43:18.200 --> 43:19.200
the old stuff.

43:19.200 --> 43:25.480
I just want the old stuff back and say, no, this is not great, but I want to make it better

43:25.480 --> 43:26.720
and not move backwards.

43:26.720 --> 43:29.740
Yeah, I can totally understand that, especially when you've been working on something for

43:29.740 --> 43:31.780
so long.

43:31.780 --> 43:35.960
It's got to be a huge driver to want to build these new things.

43:35.960 --> 43:40.080
Is the unspoken thing here is simply revenue?

43:40.080 --> 43:44.760
If this was a $50 piece of software that somebody had to buy from you before they downloaded

43:44.760 --> 43:46.520
it, you could just hire developers.

43:46.520 --> 43:53.040
Yeah, certainly, I'm not under the same impression because, so what I see is that 10 years ago

43:53.040 --> 44:00.160
when the Lutris project started, there was a big push from mostly from Ubuntu, from Canon

44:00.160 --> 44:04.600
Recall to create those developers.

44:04.600 --> 44:07.440
And this effort is just not here today.

44:07.440 --> 44:10.560
And this is something that's been noted by other developers.

44:10.560 --> 44:18.680
I've heard this from other developers, that there was a huge group efforts and everybody

44:18.680 --> 44:25.080
was developing software, even people that never called themselves software developers.

44:25.080 --> 44:31.160
They would just fire up some code editor, write some Python and GTK.

44:31.160 --> 44:34.240
And everyone was doing Python and GTK.

44:34.240 --> 44:41.000
And there was this quickly framework that would let you create those apps really fast.

44:41.000 --> 44:45.320
And now I think there's not this group efforts going on.

44:45.320 --> 44:49.000
And there's this sort of confusion of what should we do?

44:49.000 --> 44:50.880
What should I code in?

44:50.880 --> 44:52.800
Should it be in Electron?

44:52.800 --> 44:54.400
Should I code in Rust?

44:54.400 --> 44:56.880
Should I code in Python?

44:56.880 --> 45:01.200
I don't know Python developers who work in GTK anymore.

45:01.200 --> 45:04.960
I know one developer of Lollipop.

45:04.960 --> 45:05.960
I don't know him personally.

45:05.960 --> 45:07.520
I know his code.

45:07.520 --> 45:09.720
I know other small projects.

45:09.720 --> 45:16.200
There's a GOG tool that's written with Python and GTK.

45:16.200 --> 45:22.880
If I wanted to hire someone, I don't know who I would hire at this point.

45:22.880 --> 45:29.480
The finishery aspect is not the problem because I've made the decision to just work part-time

45:29.480 --> 45:31.800
because I wanted to keep Lutris going.

45:31.800 --> 45:38.720
So I have a contracted job that is only 20 hours because I want to keep...

45:38.720 --> 45:41.320
I mean, it's not just for Lutris.

45:41.320 --> 45:49.420
It's also for having some more time for myself, but also mostly to be able to work on Lutris.

45:49.420 --> 45:55.920
So that is myself putting some resources into the projects.

45:55.920 --> 46:04.440
But I've noticed that even having all this time devoted to the project doesn't necessarily

46:04.440 --> 46:10.880
help when all I see around it is no one being...

46:10.880 --> 46:17.120
Like I said, I was working on this monitoring stuff for command line applications.

46:17.120 --> 46:18.840
There's no one who is aware of this.

46:18.840 --> 46:22.760
Yes, there's an issue on GitHub.

46:22.760 --> 46:26.200
There's a few comments that have been...

46:26.200 --> 46:33.040
And if I wanted to work on this with someone, I wouldn't know who to reach out to.

46:33.040 --> 46:36.100
I wonder if it isn't the point you make in your blog.

46:36.100 --> 46:37.640
We don't have a common goal.

46:37.640 --> 46:43.120
In a silly way, hating Windows and hating Microsoft and how everybody had been burned

46:43.120 --> 46:47.420
by Windows, it was a unifying mission.

46:47.420 --> 46:53.140
We all wanted to beat Windows, and then Microsoft went and rolled over on its own.

46:53.140 --> 46:57.960
And I think in a way, with Microsoft not really being the big bad guy anymore, we've sort

46:57.960 --> 47:00.520
of lost a bit of unity.

47:00.520 --> 47:02.440
And we've sort of lost a common goal.

47:02.440 --> 47:03.440
Yeah, sure.

47:03.440 --> 47:09.600
I mean, that's something I feel, but also I don't feel that being against Microsoft

47:09.600 --> 47:11.600
brought anything of value.

47:11.600 --> 47:18.400
I mean, it brought people to lecture, but I don't think it brought technical expertise,

47:18.400 --> 47:21.480
and I don't think it brought code, like actual code.

47:21.480 --> 47:27.920
So that was something to rally, to group together, but that's...

47:27.920 --> 47:29.760
It wasn't necessarily a healthy thing.

47:29.760 --> 47:32.900
Yeah, it wasn't healthy.

47:32.900 --> 47:36.960
There's echoes and ramifications and ripples from it that I think are not positive today.

47:36.960 --> 47:37.960
I agree.

47:37.960 --> 47:40.960
And I was fully participant in it back in the day.

47:40.960 --> 47:42.880
I completely acknowledge that.

47:42.880 --> 47:48.440
Oh, I mean, I was participant in the anti-Microsoft stuff before I was using Amiga.

47:48.440 --> 47:49.440
Yeah.

47:49.440 --> 47:54.800
I mean, I didn't have a computer, and I was already on anti-Microsoft.

47:54.800 --> 47:58.440
So what do you think this leaves you as a longtime Linux user?

47:58.440 --> 48:01.920
Do you think it's kind of a new, I don't want to call it a maturing of how you are going

48:01.920 --> 48:06.000
to interact with Linux in the community, but a shift kind of like from lessons learned,

48:06.000 --> 48:11.520
is it kind of a, have you come to a new realization or a new normal, as it were?

48:11.520 --> 48:12.520
Yeah, totally.

48:12.520 --> 48:19.800
Not only because of that aspect, but also because of some more positive aspects.

48:19.800 --> 48:25.940
The more positive aspect being that I have this Linux console that can play pretty much

48:25.940 --> 48:27.900
any game I want.

48:27.900 --> 48:35.560
So from some point of view, the project is pretty much done because I have this machine,

48:35.560 --> 48:37.960
and I don't have a game that I cannot play.

48:37.960 --> 48:38.960
That's great.

48:38.960 --> 48:45.920
So from that, yeah, and that's something I want to say, okay, this is, from now on, this

48:45.920 --> 48:47.560
is the reality of Linux.

48:47.560 --> 48:52.600
This is that I have this machine that can play pretty much any game I want, regardless

48:52.600 --> 48:55.440
of its age, regardless of its platform.

48:55.440 --> 49:01.400
So I want to build based on that, and that's going to be the reality.

49:01.400 --> 49:06.540
And sure, there will be some feedback from people who send them some bug reports and

49:06.540 --> 49:08.640
they want to bring some features.

49:08.640 --> 49:16.520
But from now on, I built the software based on that console that can run those games.

49:16.520 --> 49:21.680
And that's something that I have in my living room that I can work on that is rooted in

49:21.680 --> 49:22.680
physical work.

49:22.680 --> 49:24.440
So I don't have to ask questions.

49:24.440 --> 49:27.240
I can just make progress on that.

49:27.240 --> 49:30.080
It's going to be more of an intentional development style.

49:30.080 --> 49:34.740
There's also another positive thing about Lutris is that it's also now everywhere.

49:34.740 --> 49:37.120
It's in Ubuntu, it's in Debian.

49:37.120 --> 49:41.680
So I don't want to ship something that's broken, and I want to have a lot more testing

49:41.680 --> 49:42.680
going on.

49:42.680 --> 49:48.400
And I hope that your new focus ends up making you more pleased with the process, enjoy the

49:48.400 --> 49:51.560
process a bit more, and means that we get years more of Lutris.

49:51.560 --> 49:57.400
Yeah, the goal is to be enjoying more of the development process.

49:57.400 --> 49:59.560
I care about the project a lot.

49:59.560 --> 50:07.600
I would rather change some of the aspects of the open sourcedness of the projects rather

50:07.600 --> 50:10.320
than just walk away from the projects.

50:10.320 --> 50:13.760
It's almost worth listening to that again, if you care about this issue, because what

50:13.760 --> 50:17.880
he touches on, you can kind of extract what the bigger picture issues are.

50:17.880 --> 50:22.440
Because what I heard in there is that he feels like he's been left behind by the GTK and

50:22.440 --> 50:26.480
Python stack, and he's not really sure where to go next.

50:26.480 --> 50:28.240
He hasn't really had a lot of development support.

50:28.240 --> 50:32.160
The users definitely showed up, but he hasn't really had people show up helping him.

50:32.160 --> 50:36.480
And I mean, he has had support, but not like core development features, you know, the big

50:36.480 --> 50:37.480
stuff.

50:37.480 --> 50:40.480
And I think there's also a disconnect right now because he wants to work on finishing

50:40.480 --> 50:45.840
core features, and users are submitting requests that are more like quality of life requests,

50:45.840 --> 50:48.680
not necessarily core feature fixes.

50:48.680 --> 50:52.360
And I think he's kind of getting a bit demotivated by it all.

50:52.360 --> 50:53.360
No, you're right.

50:53.360 --> 50:59.520
And this is something that started as a solo project, a hobby project, maybe, and has really

50:59.520 --> 51:00.520
grown.

51:00.520 --> 51:04.600
And in open source, it can be hard, especially, I think, you know, once you're packaged in

51:04.600 --> 51:11.440
distributions, you're widely known, there are a lot of expectations, spoken and unspoken.

51:11.440 --> 51:14.040
It's also really hard to find good development support.

51:14.040 --> 51:17.160
I mean, this is true even in like, you know, private corporate development.

51:17.160 --> 51:22.280
But when it's a baby, when it's your project, you can't just turn control over to anyone.

51:22.280 --> 51:24.280
Delegating is hard, finding good help is hard.

51:24.280 --> 51:29.320
And then if you don't totally trust them to, you know, make a fully formed PR that just

51:29.320 --> 51:32.800
needs a little light review, some checking, then you're going to either have to do a whole

51:32.800 --> 51:36.180
bunch of handholding and help, which can be good and can be one way to eventually get

51:36.180 --> 51:37.740
more help on the project.

51:37.740 --> 51:42.020
But that's a huge investment, or, you know, as Matthew mentioned, the other option is

51:42.020 --> 51:45.080
just sort of taking that idea and just doing it yourself.

51:45.080 --> 51:46.840
But that doesn't scale.

51:46.840 --> 51:49.840
And this is something he mentioned that I never thought of, because of course, I'm not

51:49.840 --> 51:55.440
a developer, but it's not easy to figure out who's the designer to go to to develop GTK

51:55.440 --> 51:59.920
applications and have them design a beautiful GTK app, or who do I go to that has this Python

51:59.920 --> 52:00.920
expertise?

52:00.920 --> 52:03.360
Like, we don't have a way to really sort that out.

52:03.360 --> 52:06.840
The downside of the flexibility, right, I mean, I think it favors folks with strong

52:06.840 --> 52:10.720
opinions and who do just want to make their own project, and I'm going to make it work

52:10.720 --> 52:11.780
my way.

52:11.780 --> 52:14.760
But if you don't have those strong opinions, or you want to try to find some help, it's

52:14.760 --> 52:16.500
not clear where are those communities?

52:16.500 --> 52:17.500
Where are other people doing?

52:17.500 --> 52:20.880
If everyone assembles it their own way on the development stack, well, they might not

52:20.880 --> 52:23.520
be ready to just jump in and use your version of that.

52:23.520 --> 52:25.400
Yeah, that is an interesting challenge as well.

52:25.400 --> 52:26.400
So yeah, you're right.

52:26.400 --> 52:32.100
That's also in there is sometimes you get a patch that comes along, but it just is written

52:32.100 --> 52:36.640
in a way that just not really fit with the rest of the projects code base.

52:36.640 --> 52:37.920
And so that's particularly tricky.

52:37.920 --> 52:41.560
And then, of course, in there, you can hear that he's had struggle with motivation as

52:41.560 --> 52:42.560
well.

52:42.560 --> 52:45.680
And our podcast, I know you had some thoughts on staying motivated when you're getting that

52:45.680 --> 52:49.820
kind of skewed feedback from users who want things and not the users that are just sitting

52:49.820 --> 52:52.520
back there loving the software using it every day.

52:52.520 --> 52:57.520
Yeah, I mean, I encountered this even in my day job sometimes with developing complex

52:57.520 --> 53:01.600
and sophisticated products, but then you only hear about what's wrong with it.

53:01.600 --> 53:03.080
You don't hear a lot of praise from it.

53:03.080 --> 53:07.320
And I think an open source that happens all too much, whether it's creating software like

53:07.320 --> 53:13.000
looters or even content creators like some of us, sometimes you just hear about wrongs

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
and not so much how to help people.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.760
And I know that can be a big problem when keeping motivated.

53:17.760 --> 53:18.760
Yeah, really.

53:18.760 --> 53:22.840
You know, because like I told him, you know, it's packaged with the distros.

53:22.840 --> 53:27.120
So it's not like I downloaded from the website, I installed from the repo, and I've just used

53:27.120 --> 53:29.040
it for like eight years.

53:29.040 --> 53:30.880
And I've never sent him a note saying thank you.

53:30.880 --> 53:32.600
That's why I actually wanted to reach out to him recently.

53:32.600 --> 53:33.600
And then he made a blog post.

53:33.600 --> 53:35.840
I was like, dude, we got to talk.

53:35.840 --> 53:40.320
And I just I really connected with that struggle of this passion project.

53:40.320 --> 53:41.900
It's a different transition for everybody.

53:41.900 --> 53:47.360
And if he could get out of the trenches and build a community of support around him that

53:47.360 --> 53:50.640
could deal with some of that lower hanging fruit, that would definitely be beneficial.

53:50.640 --> 53:55.120
But I think part of the problem is just he doesn't have the tactical time to accomplish

53:55.120 --> 53:56.120
that.

53:56.120 --> 53:57.440
And Neil, I know you've experienced this.

53:57.440 --> 53:58.800
You might have some suggestions.

53:58.800 --> 53:59.800
Yeah.

53:59.800 --> 54:03.320
So it's been something that I've had the experience for years.

54:03.320 --> 54:09.000
Like I don't actually write as much code as I used to five or six years ago.

54:09.000 --> 54:15.440
I actually spent a lot more time doing coordination and community building and all that kind of

54:15.440 --> 54:20.160
stuff because it's actually harder than writing a line of code.

54:20.160 --> 54:21.680
It's so much harder.

54:21.680 --> 54:22.960
And I still do technical work.

54:22.960 --> 54:23.960
You know that, Chris.

54:23.960 --> 54:28.920
I've, you know, the Butterfest things and stuff in Fedora with Plasma and Wayland and

54:28.920 --> 54:29.920
Pipewire and all that stuff.

54:29.920 --> 54:30.920
Yeah.

54:30.920 --> 54:31.920
I'm still doing that stuff.

54:31.920 --> 54:36.760
But I spend a lot of my time doing that because if you don't have someone actually doing that

54:36.760 --> 54:39.820
work specifically, you burn out.

54:39.820 --> 54:44.640
And so, you know, my suggestion on that front, at least, is instead of looking for another

54:44.640 --> 54:48.900
developer, look for someone that is geared towards, you know, doing the community building

54:48.900 --> 54:51.640
because you can't do both.

54:51.640 --> 54:54.080
It's just you'll burn yourself out doing it.

54:54.080 --> 54:57.160
I think he's starting to feel that in the first place.

54:57.160 --> 55:03.520
And another bit that, you know, he was talking about feeling abandoned by the PyGTK mess

55:03.520 --> 55:05.260
is the nicest way to put it.

55:05.260 --> 55:11.680
I've seen a lot of projects move from GTK to Qt mostly because of this.

55:11.680 --> 55:19.720
And the other added advantage of using Qt is that the other market that is that a lot

55:19.720 --> 55:25.600
of Linux software tends to be more successful on is Mac OS and Qt works a lot better there

55:25.600 --> 55:27.840
than GTK.

55:27.840 --> 55:33.840
And if that's something that eventually somebody wants to do like Lutris on Mac OS, I don't

55:33.840 --> 55:37.120
see any reason anyone would, that's a thing.

55:37.120 --> 55:45.620
But I think PyQt, which is officially supported by the Qt project and is maintained as part

55:45.620 --> 55:51.460
of it is pretty much the go to for a lot of the Pythonistas doing graphical applications

55:51.460 --> 55:54.480
these days is fairly straightforward to use.

55:54.480 --> 55:58.760
And with things like QML, it's super easy to do the styling and stuff like that.

55:58.760 --> 56:03.920
That's probably like if you want to take a hard look at about like switching ecosystems

56:03.920 --> 56:06.840
while remaining Python, that's probably the best choice to go.

56:06.840 --> 56:13.040
Otherwise, I mean, another option is, and this is me like doing a little plug for myself

56:13.040 --> 56:17.240
here, a project that I work on called the monotools project.

56:17.240 --> 56:21.520
We use a library called libui from the SUSE folks.

56:21.520 --> 56:26.860
That's the UI toolkit library that powers the yast installer.

56:26.860 --> 56:32.960
We have Python bindings for it and it works fairly well.

56:32.960 --> 56:40.320
And that library toolkit gives you both Qt5 and GTK3 UIs basically for free by using the

56:40.320 --> 56:43.080
abstract interface provided by libui.

56:43.080 --> 56:48.240
I think the next thing that Lutris as a project needs to consider is not hiring a developer,

56:48.240 --> 56:51.440
but hiring a community manager type.

56:51.440 --> 56:56.900
A community manager is a really good point and it could be somebody who could help kind

56:56.900 --> 57:01.880
of bubble the people that could help the most to the top to Matthew.

57:01.880 --> 57:05.880
It's a good idea because I think a support community beyond just a community of users

57:05.880 --> 57:08.440
who need, right, but a community of contributors.

57:08.440 --> 57:13.660
Well, I think you know, Chris, right, it can be hard to balance time involved directly

57:13.660 --> 57:17.600
in the community and then time doing the work, whether that's creating a show or actually

57:17.600 --> 57:21.400
heads down in the trenches trying to add a complicated technical new feature.

57:21.400 --> 57:22.560
There's just no doubt about it.

57:22.560 --> 57:27.880
I sit now as as kind of, you know, reward, I guess maybe in a way for having been around

57:27.880 --> 57:29.200
for so long.

57:29.200 --> 57:33.840
We have a lot of really good people in our community that can help help organize it as

57:33.840 --> 57:37.960
well, including a lot of people who are here in our virtual log right now.

57:37.960 --> 57:43.840
And it means that I get to be more of a participant and and that's really great.

57:43.840 --> 57:47.220
But that's that's like, you know, that's what you to get to that point.

57:47.220 --> 57:50.040
You've got to build something for a really long time.

57:50.040 --> 57:52.040
But he does have a very beloved application.

57:52.040 --> 57:56.760
So I think he's got everything that would take to build a good community around him.

57:56.760 --> 58:01.000
And you know, he and I talked a little bit off air afterwards, and he felt like there's

58:01.000 --> 58:04.120
probably some sort of shift, something is going to happen.

58:04.120 --> 58:07.780
You know, we talked a little bit about what elementary OS is doing.

58:07.780 --> 58:12.160
And he thinks that's an intriguing idea, just that just having kind of some established

58:12.160 --> 58:16.880
design languages, and he wouldn't necessarily have to use Vala either, you know, but just

58:16.880 --> 58:22.360
kind of following their GTK design language and stuff is is an idea just in its sense,

58:22.360 --> 58:24.620
just because he likes that kind of structure.

58:24.620 --> 58:28.520
I mentioned it in the in the chat, but he authored this blog post, where he goes into

58:28.520 --> 58:29.520
a lot more detail.

58:29.520 --> 58:32.400
And so if you are curious, we'll have a link in the notes.

58:32.400 --> 58:36.240
If you want to check that out, go go give that a read and it gets that's probably any

58:36.240 --> 58:38.660
real bit more in the moment of passion.

58:38.660 --> 58:42.120
You know, by the time he and I got on got on the horn, I think he had some time to reflect

58:42.120 --> 58:43.120
on a little bit.

58:43.120 --> 58:46.600
But that that blog post, I think was written kind of at the heat of the moment.

58:46.600 --> 58:52.320
So that'll be at linuxonplug.com slash 399.

58:52.320 --> 58:55.440
Just a couple of last minute housekeeping items, because we're getting long, it's a

58:55.440 --> 58:56.440
big show.

58:56.440 --> 58:57.560
399 is a lot.

58:57.560 --> 59:01.560
But there was a pretty cool up lug this Sunday.

59:01.560 --> 59:05.800
So I wanted to give mini mech a chance to give us an update on how things went at the

59:05.800 --> 59:06.800
log log.

59:06.800 --> 59:07.800
Thank you, Chris.

59:07.800 --> 59:08.800
So we had a good meeting.

59:08.800 --> 59:12.500
I think there were about 20 listeners to the talk.

59:12.500 --> 59:14.320
So the topic was very specific.

59:14.320 --> 59:18.840
I mean, creating and managing data streams is not an everyday task for a normal Linux

59:18.840 --> 59:19.840
user.

59:19.840 --> 59:23.160
But we had some well informed people in the room.

59:23.160 --> 59:27.660
And also for the first time, we had some audio and video recording.

59:27.660 --> 59:35.480
So we recorded our mumble room and Bennett shared his screen via OBS Ninja and also recorded

59:35.480 --> 59:37.640
his screen at the same time.

59:37.640 --> 59:40.880
So I think it was a pretty good success.

59:40.880 --> 59:42.380
But we have Bennett here in the room.

59:42.380 --> 59:43.560
So Bennett, what do you think?

59:43.560 --> 59:47.960
Hey, many Mac, I do have to say love blog was a huge success.

59:47.960 --> 59:49.800
I was blown away with the turnout.

59:49.800 --> 59:54.000
And I met some really interesting engineers.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.560
As many Mac mentioned, we recorded the log log.

59:56.560 --> 01:00:01.080
So in case you missed, you missed the log log and want to watch the recording, you can

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:04.040
watch the edited down condensed version.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:07.320
So you can catch a log log in a third of the time.

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:09.440
How about that?

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:10.440
That's great, guys.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:17.200
Man, you know, as we're getting close to 400, I look oh, I bet you know what, for the 400

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:20.680
time capsule, I'm going to put down how the log logs doing that's going to be number six

01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:22.280
in the time capsule.

01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:29.200
So I just say it's so cool to see that's a that's a self self started organic component

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:30.300
to this show's community.

01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:32.180
And I think it's so great.

01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:36.160
So if you want to participate in the log log, it's every Sunday, noon Pacific in our mumble

01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:37.720
room right there in the lobby.

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:42.120
And we have information about our mumble room on the website at Linux unplugged.com.

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:43.680
You can probably find that I would imagine.

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:48.620
And then also, while we're in the housekeeping, just one more reminder next week is 400.

01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:50.580
We will be live and would love to have you join us.

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:53.040
If you haven't had an opportunity to join us in a while, it'd be a great chance to come

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:57.080
by and say hi and celebrate 400 episodes of your unplugged program.

01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:59.420
Then we have 401 pre recorded.

01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:03.600
So we will not be live on April 13.

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:07.360
So 401 is going to be a pre record, but then we'll be back to our regular bat time.

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:10.740
So come hang out with us next week for 400.

01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:14.880
And then I give you permission to take the week off on 401 you just listen to it on your

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:15.880
own time.

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:17.720
I'm gonna let you do that just this once though.

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:21.280
So I don't want to see you doing that too much, but it's a special occasion.

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:26.240
And that's really all we have in the housekeeping.

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:29.960
Thank you to our members who support the show help us stay independent.

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:32.260
And that means a lot to us.

01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:35.760
And especially as we get to I'm just feeling really I don't know I'm feeling really something

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:40.080
now that we're getting close to 400 I'm really grateful for those members unplugged core.com.

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:41.080
Thank you very much.

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:42.420
We got a couple of perks for you.

01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:46.700
You get a limited ad version of the show as one feed option same full production all the

01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:50.260
Joe Levin just few less ads.

01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:55.640
And then there is feed to which is the full live stream right as we get going I hit the

01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:56.960
record button.

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:58.400
Our mumble room is our virtual leg.

01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:01.520
You know, imagine being at a log as people trickle in through the door and you're say

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:04.080
oh, you know, it's been a week since you say oh, hi, how's it going?

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:05.820
That's that's a little bit of what we do in there.

01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:10.760
We talk about a few topics and kind of just warm up and then we usually have to wind down

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:11.760
and that's all in there as well.

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:17.160
It's like a full additional show that gets packed into that second feed plus extra mistakes.

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:18.220
No kidding.

01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:19.400
No kidding.

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:26.100
And if you like to know how we messed up, that's that's how you're going to that's good.

01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:27.100
Maybe we should.

01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:28.100
What are we doing?

01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:29.100
Wes?

01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:30.100
Why are we doing that?

01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:34.200
It can't be good for our reputations too late we've committed.

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:36.120
Yeah, I know some people like the full thing.

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:41.360
So thank you everybody who supports the show over at unplugged core.com.

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:45.180
Just a couple of feedback items before we get out of here.

01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:50.720
Number one was just an excuse to mention a great tool that we haven't talked about for

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:51.720
a little bit.

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:54.160
Jack writes in he says, Hey, guys, I'm not aware if you've seen this before.

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:59.260
I think I found a great tool for system administration and for local management or even remote server

01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:00.260
management.

01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:01.260
It's called SSH.

01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:02.260
No, I'm kidding.

01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:03.920
It's called cockpit.

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:07.500
And it's of course in arch, but it's also in fedora and a lot of other distributions

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:08.500
as well.

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:12.100
And once you install it, you'll find it at localhost on port 9090.

01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:15.640
You can manage VMs, updates network and a bunch of other stuff.

01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:16.640
Hope you enjoy it.

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:17.960
And thanks for the show, Jack.

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:20.120
Well, Jack, we love cockpit here at the show.

01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:24.560
We've talked about it a few times, but Wes and I were thinking it'd been a little bit.

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:28.160
Did you recently just install to is a just totally unrelated to this email?

01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:29.160
Yeah.

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:33.320
Webman updates to J-Bot over the weekend, updates now, basic maintenance.

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:36.480
Let's call it that life support, restoration, hospice care.

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:37.480
Yeah, yeah.

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:43.000
I was moving it to a fedora 33 box and you know, there was cockpit for me already.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.400
I was like, Oh, yeah, I've kind of forgotten about cockpit, but it sure is handy to have

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:52.240
because it's come a long way and it really is quite full featured and handy.

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:54.240
Yeah, it is.

01:03:54.240 --> 01:04:00.920
And it makes, I mean, no disrespect to the Webman team, but it makes Webman just like

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:02.720
look like a real tool of the past.

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:06.800
And cockpit has much better security history and story, much more modern.

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:07.800
I think that's it.

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:11.600
I kind of forget that like GUI server management can be a thing on Linux because I mean, I'm

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:14.840
just used to using the command line anyway, and that's kind of my preference or at least

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:15.840
default.

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:18.580
But you're right, cockpit like kind of resets that it.

01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:19.580
It's good.

01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:23.880
Also, a lot of times people will write in and say, how come you don't talk about XYZ

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:25.760
Web GUI to manage containers on the show?

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:29.840
And a lot of times my response back is, oh, because cockpit does it.

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:30.840
Cockpit does it well.

01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:33.240
Five wrote in, you want to take his email?

01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:37.960
Five wrote in with a interesting little tip he developed with more people becoming eligible

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:38.960
for the COVID-19 vaccine.

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:42.960
One of the most difficult things now is getting an appointment.

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:48.720
I resorted to writing a simple Python script to output availability using the vaccine spotter.org

01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:49.720
API.

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:54.320
The script is noisy, but attempts to output only new availability.

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:58.920
I also wrote a matrix shell command to send me various notifications.

01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:04.000
I've used this script and cron to notify me when new appointments open up.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.440
Just thought I'd share with the Linux Unplugged and Jupyter broadcasting community since I

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:09.560
think everyone in it rocks.

01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:11.760
And boy, you are right about that one, Five.

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:12.760
And thanks.

01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:13.760
This looks pretty handy.

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:15.560
It can be pretty tricky to find those appointments.

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:20.040
And this is exactly the sort of open source sharing and just like you've learned some

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:24.200
fun tools on the Linux command line, and now you can make them useful for problems in your

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:25.280
own real life.

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:29.760
What a great example of learning to build something by having a problem to solve.

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:30.800
And this was a clever one.

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:31.800
I like this.

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:35.420
And it got me thinking, if you have little small projects like this, they don't have

01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:37.960
to be significant, although those are cool, too.

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:38.960
Let me know.

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:42.600
But let more importantly, let the Koda radio show know, because I'd love to maybe talk

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:46.120
about them from time to time in our feedback.

01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:50.280
Just like Five just did, you can go to koder.show slash contact for those and little code projects

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:53.940
you built to solve problems like this that maybe others might be interested in, but nobody

01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:55.400
knows about it.

01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:58.840
I'd love to share what our community is building the Koda radio program would be such a perfect

01:05:58.840 --> 01:05:59.840
outlet for that.

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:02.880
So koder.show slash contact for that stuff.

01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:03.880
Koder code swap.

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:09.340
Yeah, actually check out the Koda radio coming out later this week because Wes joined to

01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:10.680
give Mike a hard time.

01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:12.680
So I really enjoyed that episode.

01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:15.880
Hey, that wasn't my intention, but that is what happened.

01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:20.400
Anyways, this here show, if you want to find anything that we talked about today, links

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:25.320
for all of that stuff, of course, all at linuxunplugged.com slash 399.

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:29.720
If you do that Twitter thing, that Twitter thing, you can follow the podcast at Linux

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:30.720
Unplugged.

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:33.880
I'm over there at Chris LAS at Wes Payne over there.

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:34.880
That's right.

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:35.880
You on Twitter, Wes?

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:36.880
I sure am.

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:37.880
I don't see you tweet much.

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:38.880
You're not a big tweeter.

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:40.080
I should probably tweet more.

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:41.640
Or maybe I shouldn't tweet at all.

01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:43.200
I just don't know anymore.

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:45.120
You tweet when you need to, right?

01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:47.040
I mean, you're not spamming people.

01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:48.680
You're not spamming people.

01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:49.680
That's right.

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:52.800
Low volume, just some weird, interesting things from time to time.

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:55.040
Yeah, and you know, same on the Grams.

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:58.120
He's got some, you know, he's got some local pics that are pretty good.

01:06:58.120 --> 01:06:59.200
So go check that out.

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:02.880
But the whole network also has Twitter, you know, it's a thing.

01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:03.880
So what can I say?

01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:05.880
The network's there at Jupiter signal.

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:07.720
But really, you know what's great?

01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:08.720
Websites.

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:09.720
Websites are good.

01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:10.720
They're really close.

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:11.720
Jupiterbroadcasting.com.

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:12.720
So go over there.

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:15.960
Yeah, just good, clean, pure HTML for you.

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:16.960
Well, yeah.

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:19.040
I mean, I don't know about pure, but definitely HTML.

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.600
Don't look too close.

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:24.160
And be sure you check out Linux Action News every Monday morning.

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:27.840
Wes and I break down everything that matters in the world of Linux.

01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:29.080
So join us.

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:32.580
We'll be back for episode 400 next Tuesday.

01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:36.160
That's at 12pm Pacific, 3pm Eastern.

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:40.880
And we'd love to have you join us to celebrate 400 ridiculous episodes of the show I launched

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:42.440
to read emails.

01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:43.640
Yep.

01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:45.280
And now look at us go.

01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:46.800
But I'm looking forward to it.

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:50.960
Wes and I have been doing something special for the last few weeks in preparation.

01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:54.280
And we will unveil it in episode 400.

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:58.820
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

01:07:58.820 --> 01:08:23.240
And we will see you right back here next Tuesday.

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:44.640
All right, let's name it JBtitles.com.

01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:46.480
Let's go pick our title.

01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:48.600
Mumble Room, you were great today, everybody.

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:49.600
Thank you very much.

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:50.600
Lots of great discussion.

01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:52.200
I really enjoyed that.

01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:56.160
Really great that you contacted the developer for Lutris, actually, and you got to talk

01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:57.160
with him.

01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:58.160
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:02.680
And I wasn't sure if at the time it would work out, but it totally did.

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:04.000
And that was pretty cool.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.160
It was nice.

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:08.880
And I think he's found a new comfortable place with it.

01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:10.460
I think the project's safe.

01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:15.640
But I think it's good to touch in with those issues because we don't want to talk about

01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:19.080
it all the time on the show because it's kind of a bummer that a lot of things aren't great

01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:22.800
for people who are putting software out there for free, surprise, surprise.

01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:25.280
And we don't want to talk about it, but it's the reality.

01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:29.840
And I get the sense that most people in the community are down for a solution that's equitable

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:30.840
for everybody.

01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:33.360
And we just haven't really stumbled on the right one.

01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:35.760
And when we get there, I think it's going to be great for developers.

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:38.000
We're just not there right now.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:43.040
And in the meantime, it makes me even more grateful for everyone out there who's sticking

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:49.240
it out, even if they're never going to make a dime, they're somehow finding that balance

01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:50.240
and they keep going.

01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:52.160
And it just makes me just incredibly grateful for them.

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:56.280
I mean, it really makes the Linux desktop, the open source world and landscape.

01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:59.040
I mean, it makes it what it is, right?

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:22.640
And it makes the arse-kicking that we're given to the commercial desktops even more impressive.
