00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged episode 45 for June 17th, 2014.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,320
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's raised from the ashes, stronger,

3
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,880
and more in-depth than ever before. My name is Chris.

4
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,880
And my name is Matt.

5
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,320
Hey Matt. Okay, so I'm gonna be clear with you. It's gonna be an express edition this

6
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:57,800
week because I've been here since about 6am and I was here until about 10.30 last night.

7
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,980
We had some hardware death, Matt. You know there's when hardware dies and there's when

8
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,920
hardware has deathed. And I have hardware death where it's like I came into the room,

9
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,680
I heard some clicking. It kinda actually did go down like that. It happened during Coda

10
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,280
Radio yesterday. I'm sitting here and see we have a mixer, it's all controlled by software

11
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,280
and it doesn't even have physical switches. It doesn't even have physical pots as they

12
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,880
call them where you can pull up or pull down a pot to make somebody louder or quieter.

13
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,880
None of that. No sliders, Matt. It's slider free. It's all controlled by software. Well

14
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,880
guess what happens when the hard drive in the machine that controls it by software starts

15
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,200
to die? You don't have access to the mixer anymore. So we won't have our mumble room

16
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,080
with us today because I actually just got it working like an hour and a half before

17
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,240
the show. I texted Matt, I'm like, uh, Matt, I think we're gonna have to reschedule the

18
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,480
show today. And then like last thing I try, like I was like while I was texting Matt,

19
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,160
then I'm like, well, I'm gonna try one more thing. This is not gonna fix it. And of course

20
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:58,760
it fixed it. So we made it just in time for the show. So that's good. Uh, which is nice

21
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:04,100
because I got, I got something kind of fun, uh, to talk about. I've, I've, um, recently

22
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:10,360
had the opportunity to take, uh, Android, Ubuntu touch and Firefox OS, slapped them

23
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,960
all on my Android phone. And I'm going to tell you how Rick, I did it. Wow. Yeah, it's

24
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,880
really cool. Sounds like a software sandwich. I'm triple booting. I, yeah, I am. I'm triple

25
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,520
booting and the latest Android Firefox OS and Ubuntu touch. I wish we were on the mumble

26
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,120
room cause I know fate and a couple others in the mumble room are doing this. So maybe

27
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,680
after the show we'll do some post-show troubleshooting and see what they're able to do. So today

28
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,080
it's, it's only a partial show because we wanted to be able to get up. We were here,

29
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,720
but uh, it's going to be abbreviated. So why don't we start, uh, with the feedback so that

30
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,720
way we can get that covered. Cause we've got some good ones. Uh, Nick wrote in, we talked

31
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:51,080
last week about, um, the whole Alienware going with a windows box. Remember that? I, I still

32
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,960
can't get over it. It's like a bad nightmare. I keep thinking I'm going to wake up and it's

33
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,000
all going to be gone. Yeah. So to recap, for those of you who didn't catch last week's

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,240
episode of Linux Unplugged, um, at E3 last week, Alienware announced they'd be shipping

35
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:10,620
not a steam OS box, but a steam machine. The steam machine is going to run, you guessed

36
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:16,000
it, Windows. So, uh, we won't, uh, we won't know exactly what it's, what their, what their

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,560
offerings are going to be, you know, what, until it hits the market. But, uh, we had

38
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,400
some heavy thoughts. We had some, we had some, we had some frustrations, I would say. And,

39
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,180
uh, we talked about them last week on the show and Nick, Nick, I thought came in with

40
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:33,000
a pretty good response. Uh, cause we, we definitely took a hard line response and Nick, you know,

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,400
he's a, he's, he's more rational than we are. It says in Linux Unplugged episode 44, there

42
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,080
was a debate over Alienware and it betraying Linux. In my opinion, Alienware made the right

43
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,680
move. Although Linux is gaining developer support for games, Windows is developer support

44
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,680
that currently far outreaches Linux. Even when running steam OS, a gamer would be limited

45
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,240
on the selection of content that was available to him or her. The move to Windows allows

46
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,920
Alienware to push out a console that allows gamers access to the array of content available

47
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,440
for Windows while having a better UI that circumnavigates the whore that is Windows

48
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:10,260
Metro. Don't get me wrong, I love Linux, but Windows is still the OS of choice for gaming.

49
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,720
Gaming on Linux has a long way to go, but if we're going, if we're going to be seen

50
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,880
squabbling about why gaming, uh, related companies are stupid instead of asking the question

51
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,400
of how to bring games to Linux, we will not be taken seriously by developers that may

52
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,520
be looking at Linux as a viable platform. He says, uh, by the way, many popular games

53
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,720
such as Battlefield run their own independent clients and services that have yet to be coded

54
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,280
for Linux. These games would still be accessible for those using that Alienware Windows box.

55
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,000
Hopefully these developers will begin developing content for Linux, but we'll have to wait

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,940
and see. It makes a good point about like things like a Battlefield who have their own

57
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,800
like networking clients and all that stuff. There's not even available. The backend for

58
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,920
that's not even available for Linux. Well, this is true. And it goes back to what I was

59
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,920
saying last week. And then at the end of the day, it comes down to titles, you know, which,

60
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,800
which platform has the most titles. And I, and I guess Alienware was looking at that

61
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,960
fairly practically and saying, okay, look, um, while I personally think it sucks and

62
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,160
it makes me mad and it doesn't shock me that the Dell slash Alienware guys would do this,

63
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,480
I, you know, having chance to kind of noodle it over, I do feel like that that's the decision

64
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:17,480
that was made. That being said, I still don't agree with it. Yeah. And, uh, I, like I'm

65
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,160
only, I'm kind of with Riley and the chairman's like, well then why not just wait, just wait

66
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,240
till steamOS was ready for that point. Because it seems like this is a failed product already.

67
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,840
Like we've seen this product bail and you're just shipping something that's already not

68
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,080
worked. And you're going to sort of, I hope they don't draw conclusions about what steamOS

69
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,200
itself would do in a marketplace. I guess that's my Alienware may and good for them

70
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,160
fail. Go away. Yeah. Maybe that's right. Let him get out of here. Get it out of here, right?

71
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,160
That's probably a good point. Cause after all, I think Alienware is wasted effort. Yeah.

72
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,080
Yeah. Um, all right. Well, uh, because, because we have a long email to get to, I want to

73
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,520
take a moment right here and I want to stop and thank team over to linux.ting.com. They're

74
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,200
one of our sponsors for the Linux unplugged show and it's mobile that makes sense. My

75
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,920
mobile service provider and Matt's mobile service provider too. In fact, I was just

76
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,480
talking with Matt at the beginning of the show about my nexus five and Matt's got the

77
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,880
note too. Now Matt, you know, you might want to consider, I mean, I'm just going to throw

78
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,840
this out there, but you might want to consider, uh, I think, Oh, I don't actually know. Oh,

79
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,520
you know what? I think this trick I did is limited to the nexus devices, but I am doing

80
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,920
it. I, so I made my first call today on Ubuntu touch on Ting. How about that? Now tell me

81
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,400
that's not mobile that makes sense. Right? Oh, that's awesome. Yeah. So this is what's

82
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,400
great about Ting is it's, it's a flat $6 a month and then it's just your usage on top

83
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,320
of that. And that's how they bill you. They'll just take your messages, your minutes and

84
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,440
your megabytes. They'll add them up at the end of the month. Whatever bucket you fall

85
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,480
into, that's what you pay. There's no contract, there's no early termination fee and you own

86
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,600
your device outright, which I think is really great. Plus every plan comes with caller ID,

87
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,960
tethering hotspot, three-way calling, call forwarding and all the other features you'd

88
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,200
expect. And it's just your usage. There's no ETF because there's no contract, which

89
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,520
is awesome. So you feel like you have the freedom to move if you need to. They have

90
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,080
a great dashboard. But the other thing I think is really unique about Ting is their customer

91
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,760
service. They have a no hold customer service and they just did a video about how they actually

92
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:14,440
scale that. And I'll play that for this, for the audience out there.

93
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:19,480
James M asks one question. How do you do it? I've had to call you once and got a live person

94
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,240
on the first ring who was cheerful and solved my problem. I emailed another time and got

95
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,160
an answer in about 15 minutes. Are you a real company? Could you teach Comcast?

96
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,440
Well, I don't know if we could teach Comcast, but we're definitely a real company. We decided

97
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,800
a long time ago that it was just important to treat our customers the same way that we

98
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,760
like to be treated when we call. Nobody likes being put on hold. Nobody likes waiting two,

99
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,220
three days to get a response to their email. And it certainly happens. We're not perfect.

100
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,000
But we really keep an eye on how many calls we're getting and how many emails we're getting

101
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,760
and how many new customers we're signing up and then do everything that it takes to make

102
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,240
sure we've got enough staff here that are happy and properly trained and motivated in

103
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,680
the right direction to make sure that they can perform up to those levels.

104
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,580
Go to linux.ting.com to take $25 off your first device. If you've got a device that's

105
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,560
compatible with Ting, good news. They'll give you a $25 credit. And if you're like me, that'll

106
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,880
last more than your first month of Ting service. It really is something when you switch over

107
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,400
to Ting and you can go find their savings calculator over at linux.ting.com and see

108
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,040
how much you would save, put in your actual usage, and see what it'd check out to be.

109
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,320
Also check out some of their devices. They've got MiFi-only devices. That's a $6 hotspot.

110
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,360
You get that hotspot and it's just your usage. And if you don't use it very much, then you

111
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,240
don't pay very much. If you use a lot, you pay appropriately. And it makes sense. Linux.ting.com.

112
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:42,040
And a big thanks to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged. I made so, I did make that first

113
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:47,720
phone call on Ubuntu Touch on Ting. And it's a little beta because two things happen. Of

114
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:53,000
course, now I'm ribbing Ubuntu Touch and we can't get in mobile for Popey to defend it.

115
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,560
So I made the call and it worked flawlessly to make the call. And it was nice because

116
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:04,080
I didn't really have to hardly set up anything. But then the problem was is when I hung up

117
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:10,480
the other end, the Ubuntu Touch end never recognized the hang up and then just blew

118
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:18,220
through half my battery in about two minutes. Wow. Well, as you pointed out, I'll play Popey's

119
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:22,200
part here. To defend it, I would say it's beta. It's early days. It's like a recent

120
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,040
build too. Yeah, it's a super recent build too. But hey, it works. I'm running Ubuntu

121
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,080
Touch and Firefox OS on the Nexus 5. It's living the dream, man. I'm living the dream.

122
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,520
All right. Russell writes in about high DPI support under Linux. And this is a topic that

123
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:40,040
we've been tracking because I fancy myself once the monitors come down to a reasonable

124
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,560
price level. I fancy myself running the GNOME desktop on a high DPI display. So he says,

125
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,760
hey, Linux support for high DPI screens has been brought up here and there lately. So

126
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,960
I thought I'd chime in with my experiences. I bought a 4K monitor a month ago and tried

127
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:58,400
several different desktop environments with it. And the winner by far is Unity. How about

128
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:04,080
that? He says, I was an Arch user on GNOME. I got my monitor around the same time 3.12

129
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,680
hit the repos. I heard 3.12 had high DPI support, but apparently that wasn't in the binaries

130
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,320
in the repo. And I would have to recompile Cairo and GTK. And I didn't want to get into

131
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,840
that for something that should have just worked. GNOME was bad. KDE was bad. XFCE was better.

132
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:26,200
But anything lower than that required too much configuration, often on a per application

133
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,840
basis. I tried Ubuntu 14.04 and it looked really good. It has GUIs for setting up the

134
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,000
window and font scaling and everything looks as it should. I'm sure high DPI support will

135
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,080
be more of a priority for desktop environments and distributions as time goes along. But

136
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:45,960
right now it looks like Ubuntu is the clear winner. Also with a GTX 770 graphics card

137
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:57,800
on Ubuntu, I'm playing Dota 2 on max settings at 3,840 by 2,160 at 80 frames per second.

138
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:03,120
That's pretty cool. Keep up the good work, Russell. Holy crap. That is an insane resolution.

139
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:11,520
3,840 by 2,160 at 80 frames per second. Okay. Yeah, that works. He got a 4K monitor. He

140
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,200
must have dropped a pretty penny on that because I think even the cheap ones are around two

141
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:22,840
grand right now still. I'm kind of asking, and I'm a little fuddy-dove. What's the,

142
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:28,400
you know. Hey guys. HD is nice. It's great. Can you visually with human eyeballs really

143
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:33,840
notice a difference? And the value of this is negative. Yeah, I think you can actually,

144
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:39,280
but just barely. I mean, I wear glasses and I don't know. I think you barely can, and

145
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,440
I don't think it's worth that kind of money. I think it's like, it's one of those things

146
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,980
where you look at it and you're like, oh man, that text looks particularly good. And that's

147
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:54,200
kind of it. It's not like when you went from VHS to DVD, it's not that kind of jump. It's

148
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:59,760
like when you went DVD to Blu-ray, I can sometimes you're like, okay, it does look better, but

149
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,040
it doesn't look that much better, especially if you have a great DVD player and a good

150
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,840
TV. Right. And I think it's kind of the same thing. Like I have a Monoprice Korean display

151
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,560
that's a, it's got a high res, it's like a 2K resolution and it looks all right. You

152
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,680
know, it looks pretty good, but I don't know, Matt, it's coming. It's coming. I just remember

153
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,740
when just LCD screens were $2,000. Oh yeah. No kidding. Well, I still got a plasma set.

154
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,920
That's my main TV. We have an LED TV in the bedroom, but our main sets of plasma and yeah,

155
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,740
I'm happy as a clam with it. Yeah. You know, I don't know. It's like one of those things

156
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,880
to where it's like, I would probably, if I got myself, if I sat in front of it and actually

157
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:38,400
had a side by side, then I might be sold, but I'm just not there yet. And then again,

158
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,740
I'll probably wait until the prices drop. So yeah, I feel like the prices need to come

159
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:46,560
down for 4K. I feel like the Linux desktop applications and environment sounds like they

160
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,480
still have some work to do. And I also want something that's like, you know, 22 inches

161
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,880
or 27 inches. I don't want like a 15 inch high DPI display. I want like a big, big screen

162
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,600
that, you know, is going to look awesome. And yeah, I don't know. Maybe, heck, if that's,

163
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,200
if that's a year away, I mean, I'll definitely jump when it's, you know, in the few hundred

164
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,560
dollar range. I think that's when I'm going to pull the trigger when it's like 380 bucks

165
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,240
for a really, you know, like a well-respected brand or something like that that people are

166
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,640
talking all about. And I'm like, okay, I'll jump onto that. Exactly. All right. Our next

167
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:25,200
email comes in from Dave, AKA Skullplate in the IRC and in the subreddits. He says, I've

168
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,320
been playing with the digital ocean server for a while and finally decided to put it

169
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,480
to work. A short while later, I got my own Debian cloud server, own cloud Debian server

170
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,560
up and running with fail to ban log watch. And I also disabled root login and many other

171
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,280
tips I've picked up listening to the great Jupiter broadcasting podcast. Oh, thanks.

172
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,000
And reading the JV subreddits. He says, most impressive is the performance. I'm getting

173
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,240
the sinking of folders to my digital ocean server easily 10 times faster than Dropbox.

174
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,720
So I just want to say a big thanks to Chris and Matt and the JV community and even Alan

175
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,840
too. It was really easy considering a year ago, I didn't even really know how or how

176
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:03,920
to use Linux at all. Thanks again, Dave, AKA Skullplate. Yeah. You know what? Go over to

177
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:10,200
digital ocean.com. Use our promo code snap or I'm sorry, unplugged June, not snap. I

178
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,520
was thinking a text snap because Alan unplugged June for digital ocean. I'll give you a $10

179
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:19,720
credit. You can try out their $5 rig for two months or you can go hourly and that $10 credit

180
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,520
will get you quite a ways. Are you not familiar with digital ocean? Let me tell you about

181
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,360
it. Digital ocean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive

182
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,640
and easy way to spin up a cloud server. And I got to tell you, they've nailed it. Users

183
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,360
can create a cloud server in about 55 seconds and pricing plans started only $5 a month

184
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:40,800
for 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU and a terabyte of transfer. That's

185
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,520
all for $5. You know exactly what you're going to get for $5. And digital ocean has data

186
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:51,640
center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, and Amsterdam. Their interface

187
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:56,480
is amazing. Their control panel is intuitive and power users can replicate that control

188
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,760
panel with their straightforward API. Son, get in there and replicate that. Won't you?

189
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,760
They have a straightforward API and people call it beautiful, a beautiful API. Digital

ocean.com. Use the promo code unplugged June. Go over there and get yourself a droplet.

191
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,520
I've been hearing from folks that use it for an IRC server. An own cloud server seems

192
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:18,160
to be very popular and recently more and more folks are jumping on digital ocean to deploy

193
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,200
GitLab. Now digital ocean is sitting on top of KVM. They have a droplet system that lets

194
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:28,840
you manage your instances. You can back them up, replicate them, move them between data

195
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:34,480
centers, manage your DNS, access the console via their HTML5 console, written in Go, select

196
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,080
your data center anywhere in the world, then choose your distribution, the architecture

197
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,680
of that distribution, and then deploy. And you can do it all in about 55 seconds and

198
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,520
you can be up and running. And with our promo code unplugged June, you can try it out for

199
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:50,280
two months for absolutely free. Go get yourself an SSD powered server connected to tier one

200
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:54,760
bandwidth. Partner with the amazing hardware providers that digital ocean has chosen over

201
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:59,120
digital ocean.com. Use the promo code unplugged June and a big thanks to digital ocean for

202
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:05,400
sponsoring Linux Unplugged. Yeah. You know, here recently I've been doing this whole WordPress

203
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,720
thing with them, right? Because I've already got a Vidtor sync set up with them. So I set

204
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,240
up another instance because I wanted to try the WordPress thing. Oh my gosh, it's stupid

205
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,400
simple to do. Yeah, it's awesome. I couldn't get it. I couldn't get it. I was like, why

206
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,800
the hell is everybody else doing this with so much more difficulty? This is great. And

207
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,800
you know what I would always just keep in mind? Zombies don't run Linux. So you don't

208
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,580
have to worry about it. You don't have to worry about zombies. Yeah. Okay. So I want

209
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:31,840
to tell you just before we wrap up the express edition of Linux Unplugged, I want to tell

210
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:37,680
you about this wizardry that Rekai pulled on my Nexus 5. So I've been having some, I'm

211
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,760
trying not to hate on Android, Matt, but I'm, I just keep having these problems that are

212
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,640
just driving me crazy. And so Rekai just kind of jokingly said, well, why don't you try

213
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,200
it? Or actually I think it was Marissa and the chairman that Rekai do was like, yeah,

214
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,920
do that. Why don't you just try out Firefox OS for a couple of days, Chris, and see what

215
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,560
you think. I was like, oh yeah, well if you can put on my Nexus 5, I'll take the Firefox

216
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:00,640
OS challenge. Well then guess what? Guess what happened? He put Firefox OS on my Nexus

217
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:06,680
5. Oh my. Our buddy Jordan has a guide on the XDA forums on one way you can do it. I'll

218
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:11,400
have links in the show notes too. So if you guys want to follow along it, check this out,

219
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,480
Matt. Now it does require that you root the device, but on the Nexus 5, this isn't like,

220
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,320
that's not like a crazy process. And then once you've rooted the device, you can go

221
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:24,760
out and get a piece of software that's like a, it's not called ROM manager anymore. I

222
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:30,160
have a link to it in the show notes. Let me see if I can pull it up for you. Multi-ROM,

223
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,300
that's what it's called. It's called Multi-ROM. This is an app that you install from the Play

224
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:38,280
Store once you've rooted your device, and I'll have a link to the Play Store in the

225
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,440
show notes. Once you've rooted your device, you install this Multi-ROM and it essentially

226
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:48,240
is a multi-boot menu. So when I power on now my Nexus 5, if I tap the screen, otherwise

227
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,000
it just boots right into Android, but if I tap the screen when a little prompt comes

228
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,800
up, I get a very nice gooey bootloader where it says, okay, do you want to load Ubuntu

229
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,580
Touch? Do you want to load Firefox OS or do you want to load Android? And then whichever

230
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:05,640
I choose, that's the OS it boots right into and it rocks. It's full native. It's like

231
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,280
when you partition a PC and you install multiple operating systems and then load a bootloader.

232
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,880
It's not running under emulation. It's not running under Android. It's truly Ubuntu

233
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:20,520
Touch and truly Firefox OS on the machine on the Nexus 5. It's pretty awesome. It's

234
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,420
pretty cool. It's a good way to play with these things and I think the Nexus 5 is going

235
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:31,640
to make a killer rig to have because you have things like this Multi-ROM, which right now

236
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:39,360
only supports the Nexus 5, 4, and 7 series, 2012 and 2013 Nexus 7. The chat room is asking

237
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,000
about space. I have a 32GB Nexus 5, so I think maybe I've got a little more room to play

238
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:52,360
with than if you had a 16GB. Yeah. But it's pretty good now. I'll tell you, I don't know

239
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:57,400
if I could live in either one of them. That's why I really like that Android's still there.

240
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,560
You have to wipe the phone too because when you root it and set this up, it wipes all

241
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:05,440
of them and then you do a recovery and reload Android and you have to set it all up. It

242
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,760
means reconfiguring all my damn apps and all that stuff. But you do it once and then you

243
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:15,760
have the triple boot forever, which is kind of cool. Well, here's the $10,000 question.

244
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,360
We've got the whole, obviously there's probably some sort of a battery bug or maybe it's not

245
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,360
fully optimized in the Ubuntu OS for the phone and that's fine. But for Firefox OS, what

246
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,080
was your feelings on that? Because that has me curious, especially on the lower spec phones.

247
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:34,340
Yeah, man. Firefox OS, it's funny in some ways how much is like Android in the way you

248
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:38,920
pull down the notification tray and there's all your notifications and the way the icons

249
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:43,740
kind of look and stuff. And it's got some funky stuff too about it. Like the bottom

250
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:48,920
row has like a home button, but it's not a home icon. It's a worldwide web browser generic

251
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:56,040
icon. And you push that and it takes you back to the homepage. I was hoping it would perform

252
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:00,480
better on the Nexus 5 because I've played with it on lower end hardware. And I kind

253
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:07,000
of assumed perhaps the performance was because it was on low end hardware. And I think that

254
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,200
was part of it, but it also I think is maybe it's just not totally optimized for my device.

255
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,580
Like the camera doesn't work under Firefox OS and it doesn't detect my SIM card. Yeah.

256
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:23,380
So it could be a driver problem. So I wasn't quite as enamored with it as I was expecting,

257
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:27,840
but I think maybe if we keep updating it and keep tracking it. Honestly, between the two,

258
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,600
Ubuntu Touch seems like it's in a better state on the Nexus 5. And that's not great. Like

259
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,160
it crashed on me, right? It drained all my battery. So they're both a little ways off,

260
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,300
but it's fun to play with. Interesting. I don't know. Maybe I'll do a video on it in

261
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:44,480
the future if people are interested. Let me know guys. On the Linux Action Show subreddit,

262
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,080
linuxactionshow.reddit.com. We'll have a thread for this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

263
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,080
Let me know if you guys are interested in getting more coverage. I don't really have

264
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,240
a good sense if you guys care about this kind of stuff, but I know we have talked a lot

265
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,240
about Firefox OS. We've talked obviously a lot about Ubuntu Touch. So it's kind of neat

266
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:04,680
to have one device I can carry with me and play with those right now. So I think that'll

267
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,240
help. I really appreciate like, oh, here's some screenshots of the multi-boot for those

268
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,600
of you watching the video version. So when you boot up the phone, this is the interface

269
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,880
you get. It says auto-boot, but you touch anywhere on the screen to interrupt the auto-boot.

270
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:22,920
And then when you do that, you can choose your distro or, I'm sorry, I guess, ROM that

271
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,600
you want to boot. And you can see in this case, you could load Tizen on there. You could

272
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:31,120
even load different like CyanogenMod and different Android ROMs on there too. So it could also

273
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,360
be a way to play with different Android ROMs. It doesn't have to be radically different

274
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,400
operating systems. It's pretty neat. And I think it's another reason to get the Nexus

275
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,920
5 too, because people are able to write that kind of stuff for it.

276
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,920
They're cool.

277
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:49,640
Yeah, man. Yeah, man. All right. So before we run, since we're doing an express edition,

278
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,720
that way I can wrap up here and tear apart the audio and try to get things like the mumble

279
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,960
room working and a couple other problems that we've currently band-aided over so that way

280
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,440
we can get on air. But you feel like, hey, Chris, not enough show. Not enough show, brah.

281
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,080
Well, then here's what I have for you, brah. Go over to JupiterBroadcasting.com and check

282
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:13,280
out Tech Talk today. Episode 10 came out. Matt, do you remember an old piece of software

283
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,400
called Pointcast from like the late 90s?

284
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,400
Very vaguely.

285
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,720
The push technology that was going to change the web because the web was too hard to use

286
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,440
and the web was too slow to download multimedia, so you had to do it in batch processing. Well,

287
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,400
because we were having so many problems this morning, I did a retro tech edition of Tech

288
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,600
Talk today and we looked back at Pointcast and the technology that almost shaped the

289
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:41,160
future of the internet but then petered out and those who bet big and lost. We covered

290
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:45,580
that on Tech Talk today. And of course, of course, go check out the first two episodes

291
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:49,200
of How To Linux. Getting that off the ground right now. We'll have more information on

292
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,760
that show very soon as well. So two shows you can go check out right now if there's

293
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,080
not enough show. And I'm sorry that we did have to cut it short, but we do have these

294
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,960
problems. I want to get fixed that way. By the time it's like getting towards TechSnap

295
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:06,160
and Linux Action Show, hopefully we'll have everything all ironed out. All right, Matt.

296
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,960
Well, heck, guess what? That's it right there. We're going to wrap it up. We're all done.

297
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,560
That was a quick and easy one, huh? Quick and easy.

298
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:17,440
Yeah, I thought maybe we'd have to bail and do it on Thursday, but I think this worked

299
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,840
out okay. This worked out quite nicely. Now, I do want to encourage all of you to join

300
