00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Linux Unplugged, Episode 11 for October 22nd, 2013.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.560
Hi, everyone, and welcome to Linux Unplugged, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly Linux talk show

00:40.560 --> 00:44.880
that's writing checks our mouth can't cash, but we push on anyways.

00:44.880 --> 00:46.120
My name is Chris.

00:46.120 --> 00:47.120
My name is Matt.

00:47.120 --> 00:48.120
Hey there, Matt.

00:48.120 --> 00:49.120
Episode 11, buddy.

00:49.120 --> 00:50.120
Look at us.

00:50.120 --> 00:51.120
Already.

00:51.120 --> 00:52.120
All in a row, too.

00:52.120 --> 00:53.840
Now, who knows, because we're coming up to those wily holidays.

00:53.840 --> 00:55.300
You never know what could happen.

00:55.300 --> 00:56.300
This is true.

00:56.300 --> 00:57.700
So people have to prepare themselves now.

00:57.700 --> 01:02.360
So coming up on this week's show of Unplugged, I want to talk about something that's been

01:02.360 --> 01:06.880
bothering me for at least a year, in fact, since November of 2012, to tell you the truth.

01:06.880 --> 01:11.160
I could tell you exactly when, but as the Linux action show has gone on, we have gotten

01:11.160 --> 01:16.300
a really good snapshot of what the Linux news looks like every single week for over the

01:16.300 --> 01:23.200
last seven years, and there's been a change in tone, in quality, in amount, all of it.

01:23.200 --> 01:27.600
Linux news has gone bankrupt, and I want to talk about it on today's Linux Unplugged because

01:27.600 --> 01:31.800
I think it's something that, because open source is done in the open, because it is

01:31.800 --> 01:37.320
such a community effort, I believe the dialogue around open source plays an extremely critical

01:37.320 --> 01:42.920
role in future development and in perception, and then that plays into participation and

01:42.920 --> 01:43.920
all these things.

01:43.920 --> 01:47.640
So I think it has very, very large and wide-reaching ramifications.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.160
So I'll talk about that today.

01:49.160 --> 01:54.040
But you know, Matt, as is tradition, because this is a very community-involved show, I

01:54.040 --> 01:57.680
want to get into the follow-up, and a couple of things.

01:57.680 --> 02:00.680
Oh, I can imagine.

02:00.680 --> 02:02.720
Oh yes, let the beatings begin.

02:02.720 --> 02:06.800
I know, I know, you know, the Linux game cast, they call this section the hate mail.

02:06.800 --> 02:10.160
We do have a little hate mail today, but first I want to correct, oh actually, first I want

02:10.160 --> 02:11.160
to do a thank you.

02:11.160 --> 02:12.720
So let's start off on a positive note.

02:12.720 --> 02:13.720
All right.

02:13.720 --> 02:14.720
Integros.

02:14.720 --> 02:20.760
In fact, the good folks over at Integros came out in full force to reach out after we talked

02:20.760 --> 02:24.960
about them in the spotlight on Sunday on the Linux Action Show.

02:24.960 --> 02:29.400
We had a visitor in our subreddit who answered some technical questions and also corrected

02:29.400 --> 02:31.080
a mistake I made.

02:31.080 --> 02:37.200
Their installer looks a lot like Ubiquiti from Ubuntu's installer, but it is actually

02:37.200 --> 02:38.760
their own custom-done installer.

02:38.760 --> 02:40.040
Oh, it is custom.

02:40.040 --> 02:41.040
That's fantastic.

02:41.040 --> 02:45.320
And you know, to defend myself, I made that assumption because I drilled into the GitHub

02:45.320 --> 02:51.120
repo for their distro, went into the installer code, and I saw references to Ubiquiti.sh

02:51.120 --> 02:54.040
and a screenshots folder that had Zubuntu screenshots in it.

02:54.040 --> 02:57.980
So I thought, there's a good chance this is based on Ubiquiti because it looks like Ubiquiti.

02:57.980 --> 03:01.600
There's Ubiquiti names in here, but the developers said, well, we were just pulling in different

03:01.600 --> 03:04.640
bits of code to try different things out, and we're in the process of cleaning things

03:04.640 --> 03:05.640
up.

03:05.640 --> 03:06.640
Oh, okay.

03:06.640 --> 03:07.880
Well, that makes more sense then.

03:07.880 --> 03:12.240
And so I just wanted to make that correction and also a big thank you because then also

03:12.240 --> 03:19.080
I was contacted on our IRC server, if you go to irc.geekshed.net, that's our IRC server,

03:19.080 --> 03:23.720
and then pound jupyterbroadcasting is the room, Alex from Integros reached out to me

03:23.720 --> 03:27.640
and answered a few questions I had, talked about a few upcoming things they have, provided

03:27.640 --> 03:32.200
me with an example, in fact, I think I have it right here, let's see if this plays because

03:32.200 --> 03:33.200
I have.

03:33.200 --> 03:35.760
That's how you're supposed to say it.

03:35.760 --> 03:36.760
He generated that for us.

03:36.760 --> 03:37.760
How cool is that?

03:37.760 --> 03:40.960
That is cool because I'm going to literally play that.

03:40.960 --> 03:43.720
Every time I have to say it, I'm just going to hit that button.

03:43.720 --> 03:47.560
Yeah, Integros, so I wanted to say a special thank you to them.

03:47.560 --> 03:52.120
For those of you who don't know, Integros is a distro that's essentially straight up

03:52.120 --> 03:53.120
Arch.

03:53.120 --> 03:56.840
They pull from the Arch repos, they have a small repo of their own where they pull certain

03:56.840 --> 03:58.520
things in like art and other things.

03:58.520 --> 04:03.560
They set up a very minimal set of defaults, I mean, super minimal, like I don't even think

04:03.560 --> 04:08.200
there's a video player installed, and as it installs, it pulls down packages from the

04:08.200 --> 04:10.040
Arch repo.

04:10.040 --> 04:15.400
And if you want to try out like Cinnamon 2.0 or Gnome 3.10.1, it's a great way to go because

04:15.400 --> 04:16.400
you can be up and running.

04:16.400 --> 04:19.580
Now, a lot of people have had some hardware issues, but they're working on new features,

04:19.580 --> 04:22.180
so we'll keep an eye on it.

04:22.180 --> 04:23.180
It looks really promising.

04:23.180 --> 04:24.680
I know I'm going to be checking into it.

04:24.680 --> 04:27.000
Yeah, it's cool of them to reach out to like that.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.480
They definitely went the extra mile.

04:29.480 --> 04:33.680
And then one other thing, you know, I was talking, we did a review, just a few corrections

04:33.680 --> 04:34.680
from last.

04:34.680 --> 04:40.320
We did a review of the Synology DissStation 4 Bay Network Attached Storage, the DS412+.

04:40.320 --> 04:42.000
Oh, yes.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.600
And I gave it a pretty glowing thumbs up, all in all, if you want to pay a premium for

04:46.600 --> 04:50.960
a small, silent, you know, sort of pre-done appliance.

04:50.960 --> 04:52.160
Basically awesome in a box.

04:52.160 --> 04:53.440
I really liked it, Matt.

04:53.440 --> 04:56.080
I mean, in fact, I bought one on Monday.

04:56.080 --> 04:57.080
So I bought one yesterday.

04:57.080 --> 04:58.080
Oh, did you?

04:58.080 --> 04:59.080
Yeah, I did.

04:59.080 --> 05:00.080
I just went ahead and I said, you know, I'm going to buy it.

05:00.080 --> 05:01.080
And so I did.

05:01.080 --> 05:06.560
However, there is one thing that I totally forgot to mention, and it's probably my main

05:06.560 --> 05:10.160
con is it uses an external power supply.

05:10.160 --> 05:15.360
And on top of that, it's got a real funky, you know, proprietary power adapter.

05:15.360 --> 05:16.360
Oh, does it?

05:16.360 --> 05:17.360
Okay.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.520
So that could make replacing it interesting.

05:19.520 --> 05:20.520
Sure.

05:20.520 --> 05:25.640
Now, to be honest, in this rig, I would actually suspect that the number one thing to fail

05:25.640 --> 05:27.400
would either be a fan or the power supply.

05:27.400 --> 05:31.200
And if it was the power supply and it's integrated, that kind of, you know, is more of a pain

05:31.200 --> 05:32.200
in the butt.

05:32.200 --> 05:35.160
Whereas if it's an external brick, you just replace that brick.

05:35.160 --> 05:39.320
I don't like that the connector is proprietary, but I bet you I could buy an extra one and

05:39.320 --> 05:40.320
have it in a drawer.

05:40.320 --> 05:43.560
And if it ever popped on me, I bet I could just swap it out real quick.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.760
I like the idea of having a spare.

05:45.760 --> 05:47.000
I think that's a wise idea.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
And I think you're right.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.600
I think the fan would be the probably the next thing to go or either or, sure.

05:51.600 --> 05:55.720
And then it was pointed out on our subreddit that the fact, let me go look for it, because

05:55.720 --> 06:00.240
they have a, I didn't even know this because I just didn't, I was never really going down

06:00.240 --> 06:05.960
the route of looking at a Synology NAS until I was offered to review one.

06:05.960 --> 06:09.960
Their five drive unit, Heyo, five drives, how about that?

06:09.960 --> 06:11.480
It has a built in power supply.

06:11.480 --> 06:14.760
So if you want to go that route, it has the plug and then you don't have to have that

06:14.760 --> 06:17.880
external adapter, but it's like a hundred bucks more.

06:17.880 --> 06:18.880
Right.

06:18.880 --> 06:19.880
Right.

06:19.880 --> 06:20.880
Oh, that's a good looking machine.

06:20.880 --> 06:21.880
Yeah.

06:21.880 --> 06:24.480
They also have a $200 version that's a two drive unit or like a $300 unit.

06:24.480 --> 06:25.480
Oh yeah?

06:25.480 --> 06:28.760
So it has all the same features as the one I have, but it's a few hundred dollars cheaper

06:28.760 --> 06:29.920
because it's only takes two drive.

06:29.920 --> 06:35.200
And if you just want a nice fast network attached storage with some mirrors that runs Linux,

06:35.200 --> 06:36.200
you know, that'd be a good way to go.

06:36.200 --> 06:38.240
I have it linked in last week's Linux action show.

06:38.240 --> 06:39.240
Just do me a favor and click that link.

06:39.240 --> 06:40.240
So that way we get credit.

06:40.240 --> 06:41.240
Yeah.

06:41.240 --> 06:42.240
Right.

06:42.240 --> 06:43.240
No kidding.

06:43.240 --> 06:45.100
And I got to ask, what if it has all the same functionality and features you were showing

06:45.100 --> 06:46.100
off?

06:46.100 --> 06:47.520
I believe it has the same OS and everything.

06:47.520 --> 06:48.520
Yeah.

06:48.520 --> 06:49.520
Yeah.

06:49.520 --> 06:50.520
I like it.

06:50.520 --> 06:51.520
Right.

06:51.520 --> 06:52.520
Yeah.

06:52.520 --> 06:53.520
All right.

06:53.520 --> 06:54.520
So now you're ready for your, my bit, my hate mail is coming up.

06:54.520 --> 06:55.520
Yeah, absolutely.

06:55.520 --> 06:56.520
Let's get it over with.

06:56.520 --> 06:57.520
All right.

06:57.520 --> 06:59.040
So John writes in, he says, greetings, Chris and Matt.

06:59.040 --> 07:03.240
One of the common things I hear from Matt is if you don't like a distro, use something

07:03.240 --> 07:05.800
else, which always makes me cringe just a little.

07:05.800 --> 07:12.000
I realize that he's addressing the functional aspect of a distro, but I think the relational

07:12.000 --> 07:16.560
aspect is also very important as Chris had recently, Linux distros are a type of art

07:16.560 --> 07:19.520
and they're an evolving art, kind of like a movie franchise.

07:19.520 --> 07:23.220
So Ubuntu doing something stupid is a bit like Hollywood bastardizing some franchise

07:23.220 --> 07:27.640
that you loved with an unnecessary reboot, but it being told, why don't you care?

07:27.640 --> 07:28.640
Just don't watch it.

07:28.640 --> 07:31.160
Sort of, I guess, maybe like the new Star Trek series.

07:31.160 --> 07:35.320
Part of being in the Linux community to me is having some kind of attachment as hobbies

07:35.320 --> 07:36.320
often have.

07:36.320 --> 07:39.440
For me personally, I'm aware that if Ubuntu does something I don't like, I can hop to

07:39.440 --> 07:43.440
another distro, but hearing it as the first response to a criticism sounds like just giving

07:43.440 --> 07:45.100
Ubuntu a free pass.

07:45.100 --> 07:46.100
Just my two cents.

07:46.100 --> 07:47.800
Thanks for the shows and keep up the good work.

07:47.800 --> 07:48.800
Not Brian T.

07:48.800 --> 07:53.840
I think it's a valid point in that, well first I would actually clarify one thing that just

07:53.840 --> 07:57.040
because I say don't use it doesn't mean I think it's awesome or that I'm acknowledging

07:57.040 --> 07:59.920
that I think it's something we should just overlook or excuse.

07:59.920 --> 08:02.880
I'm simply pointing out factually, and I'm going to throw out another one that's going

08:02.880 --> 08:03.940
to irritate you guys.

08:03.940 --> 08:07.120
If you ever tried to herd cats, it doesn't work.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.920
Wait, did I just call up John O'Bacon?

08:08.920 --> 08:10.320
What's going on over here?

08:10.320 --> 08:14.900
But yeah, no seriously, if you ever tried to herd cats, there's certain limitations

08:14.900 --> 08:15.900
to what you can do.

08:15.900 --> 08:19.480
I'm talking with distributions and the people that design them and run them.

08:19.480 --> 08:22.360
You have limited control, and so you have a choice.

08:22.360 --> 08:27.560
You can either focus on that negativity or you can say, wow, I'm not really into this,

08:27.560 --> 08:30.480
so I'm going to go participate in something that I am into.

08:30.480 --> 08:32.160
It legitimately comes down to that.

08:32.160 --> 08:38.240
I hate to play this card, but I think it's also the perspective of somebody who's got

08:38.240 --> 08:42.600
a few years on not Brian T.

08:42.600 --> 08:48.760
Because as you start to get a little, even in your mid-30s, you start to think, God,

08:48.760 --> 08:52.080
I have a limited amount of even energy to devote to anything.

08:52.080 --> 08:56.000
In my 20s, I would have been probably right there with him with a sign in my hand.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.520
I could totally see myself doing this.

08:57.520 --> 09:02.440
However, at the same time, I also acknowledge when I have issues with the new Star Trek

09:02.440 --> 09:05.360
movie, I would not want to be told, well, just don't watch it.

09:05.360 --> 09:07.800
I'm like, no, no, you don't understand Star Trek.

09:07.800 --> 09:08.800
It's Star Trek.

09:08.800 --> 09:09.800
You don't understand.

09:09.800 --> 09:10.800
That would be my response.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.640
I do see where he's coming from on that.

09:13.640 --> 09:18.080
I guess it's almost not healthy, though.

09:18.080 --> 09:26.040
It's almost not healthy to place your personal self-happiness onto an external entity like

09:26.040 --> 09:27.040
that.

09:27.040 --> 09:30.660
That's basically my message in that I'm not discounting the fact that you shouldn't be

09:30.660 --> 09:35.080
bothered or even upset by something that is bugging you.

09:35.080 --> 09:39.780
I'm not saying that, but you have X amount of energy to exhaust in a day, and you really

09:39.780 --> 09:41.080
got to look at where you're putting that.

09:41.080 --> 09:45.300
If it was me, and I'm really bent out of shape about what Ubuntu is doing, by God, I'm going

09:45.300 --> 09:50.000
to put some effort into another distribution that I can get excited about and make it better

09:50.000 --> 09:53.160
than the thing that I have a problem with, if I can.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.160
That's just me.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.580
I guess everybody's mileage is going to vary to that, but I think he brings up a valid

09:56.580 --> 09:59.680
point because it's a valid concern that he has, and so I want to address that head on

09:59.680 --> 10:03.800
and let him know that don't see it changing, but it's how I come from.

10:03.800 --> 10:08.120
What you're also doing when you say that is you're reminding us that Linux is not Ubuntu

10:08.120 --> 10:11.360
or Linux is not Fedora, Linux is not Unity, it's not Gnome.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.360
It's a lot of things.

10:12.360 --> 10:16.320
Be part of the market that helps decide what the direction of popularity is going to go.

10:16.320 --> 10:18.000
That was the message of last week's episode.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Yeah, it really was.

10:19.000 --> 10:24.120
I definitely wouldn't poopoo his point because I think it's a valid point, but age definitely

10:24.120 --> 10:25.440
plays a part into it.

10:25.440 --> 10:30.080
The way I look at life compared to in my 20s compared to now at 40, just there's a lot

10:30.080 --> 10:35.040
of factors, but I truly am trying very hard to remove as much negativity out of my life

10:35.040 --> 10:37.600
as I can, and that's part of that process.

10:37.600 --> 10:42.240
Yeah, and it is sort of like if something, and there is also sort of a zen-ness to if

10:42.240 --> 10:44.680
something's bothering you, stop doing it.

10:44.680 --> 10:46.640
It's like that old age old story.

10:46.640 --> 10:49.640
Every time I go to the doctor and I do this, hey doc, every time I move my leg like this

10:49.640 --> 10:52.040
it hurts, and the doctor says, well stop moving your leg like that.

10:52.040 --> 10:56.840
It's like Bob Newhart on Mad TV where he was doing therapy, and the entire therapy session

10:56.840 --> 11:00.720
where he'd lean in real close and scream stop it to whoever was complaining about whatever

11:00.720 --> 11:03.280
was ailing them, and that's really what it is.

11:03.280 --> 11:04.280
Yeah, it is.

11:04.280 --> 11:05.280
It really is that simple.

11:05.280 --> 11:10.040
All right, are you ready for my hate mail now?

11:10.040 --> 11:14.920
This actually is probably more so the next one is actually more directed at me, but this

11:14.920 --> 11:21.120
one starts with a name that's kind of hard, Adnan, A-D-N-A-N, Adnan, Adnan, let's go

11:21.120 --> 11:22.120
with Adnan.

11:22.120 --> 11:27.100
He says, hey guys, in last week's episode of the Ubuntu 13.10 review, you talked a lot

11:27.100 --> 11:30.680
about rolling releases and how you missed that factor of innovation, latest features

11:30.680 --> 11:34.780
from Ubuntu, especially from the last couple of releases, and how you found your peace

11:34.780 --> 11:37.280
of mind in a rolling release such as Arch Linux.

11:37.280 --> 11:44.660
Now I went with this one because we got a lot of emails about rolling release statements,

11:44.660 --> 11:49.360
and I think maybe I came off as like you could only use rolling release, and if you don't

11:49.360 --> 11:50.360
...

11:50.360 --> 11:52.360
If you don't like rolling releases, go to hell or something's wrong with you or whatever.

11:52.360 --> 11:56.960
What my argument was supposed to be was if you are technically comfortable, you can be

11:56.960 --> 12:03.040
part of pushing the open source envelope forward by perhaps rolling on something a little more

12:03.040 --> 12:07.160
cutting edge, a little more rolling, but it doesn't work for everybody.

12:07.160 --> 12:12.720
However, I don't know, I didn't get that point across very well, and Adnan here points out

12:12.720 --> 12:16.520
that one thing we don't really ever mention is the elephant in the room, and that is Debian.

12:16.520 --> 12:19.920
I kind of feel like we do, but I wanted to give an honorable mention here.

12:19.920 --> 12:24.040
He says, Debian testing, specifically the Jessie version, and unstable SID, which neither

12:24.040 --> 12:28.700
is rolling in a full meaning of that word, but yet both branches still get rolling release

12:28.700 --> 12:32.320
model where software is continually being developed and updated.

12:32.320 --> 12:36.920
Thus, why couldn't Debian Jessie be everyone's perfect rolling release with its actual rolling

12:36.920 --> 12:39.480
release until it becomes stable, quote, unquote?

12:39.480 --> 12:43.120
If you think about it, Ubuntu became a rolling model of... Yeah, okay, so he goes on to

12:43.120 --> 12:47.120
say that's essentially what Ubuntu did, yeah, and he says that Jessie can be a bleeding

12:47.120 --> 12:48.120
edge distro.

12:48.120 --> 12:51.260
Mentioning the 7.2 release in the last episode was a very nice gesture, but I'm sending this

12:51.260 --> 12:55.680
email as a plea to provide your audience with more information and awareness about Debian

12:55.680 --> 12:58.520
as perfectly portrayed from examples I used above.

12:58.520 --> 13:02.520
Debian seems to be left out, even though it provides us all with the functionality and

13:02.520 --> 13:03.520
features.

13:03.520 --> 13:04.520
Please inform me if you have any other questions or comments.

13:04.520 --> 13:05.520
Adnan.

13:05.520 --> 13:08.160
I'm going to actually agree with him on that we don't talk about Debian enough.

13:08.160 --> 13:11.120
I will actually completely agree with that, myself especially.

13:11.120 --> 13:16.000
I'm probably the biggest guilty party on that one, because we dance around Debian by talking

13:16.000 --> 13:20.280
about all the derivatives, but we don't really talk about Debian specifically and its advantages

13:20.280 --> 13:21.280
and disadvantages.

13:21.280 --> 13:23.880
You know, my wife and I talk about the dishwasher a lot more than we talk about the foundation

13:23.880 --> 13:24.880
of my house.

13:24.880 --> 13:30.840
No, that's fair, but as a standalone distro, Debian does have a little something to offer

13:30.840 --> 13:32.320
for those that want to go that route.

13:32.320 --> 13:35.720
Now, that being said, we're not going to make an ongoing show about it.

13:35.720 --> 13:36.720
That's not possible.

13:36.720 --> 13:37.720
The Debian action show.

13:37.720 --> 13:38.720
Yeah.

13:38.720 --> 13:41.200
So I think what we did just there really nails it.

13:41.200 --> 13:44.280
I mean, it's like, this is an option you guys should check out.

13:44.280 --> 13:47.760
You want an Ubuntu-like experience without the Ubuntu, give it a whirl.

13:47.760 --> 13:56.920
Ubuntu, I mean, Debian is sort of, it's unbelievable in the sense that, so when I really first

13:56.920 --> 14:04.680
started cutting my teeth on Linux, I worked at a school district and they have run systems,

14:04.680 --> 14:09.020
you know, it was like, I guess what I'm trying to say is their IT department for a little

14:09.020 --> 14:13.920
bit for me was like a time capsule, because I went back 10 years later, kind of like a

14:13.920 --> 14:18.080
reunion at the time of my high school reunion, but instead I was like, I was going back to

14:18.080 --> 14:22.840
that job to contract for three months and like I opened up the time capsule and what

14:22.840 --> 14:28.360
I found was Debian systems that we had deployed that had just recently either been retired

14:28.360 --> 14:33.020
or about to be retired, but like had been updated throughout the years and continued

14:33.020 --> 14:34.020
to run.

14:34.020 --> 14:39.400
I mean, it was, it was really like a, if you could do a long-term science experiment as

14:39.400 --> 14:45.200
an IT guy, where you just like got grant funding to study something for 10 years.

14:45.200 --> 14:46.200
It was like that for me.

14:46.200 --> 14:47.800
I was like, holy crap, here it is.

14:47.800 --> 14:52.240
In reality, here is, you know, the honest to God goodness of Debian just lasting this

14:52.240 --> 14:53.240
entire time.

14:53.240 --> 14:54.240
It was pretty cool.

14:54.240 --> 14:57.520
So I think the long and short of it is that Debian is a great option if you want something

14:57.520 --> 15:01.820
that you can install and honestly not think about ever again.

15:01.820 --> 15:02.820
That's really it, you know.

15:02.820 --> 15:03.820
Totally.

15:03.820 --> 15:04.820
Yep.

15:04.820 --> 15:06.340
I'm going to give you a ding for that, Matt, because I agree.

15:06.340 --> 15:08.160
So now this next one.

15:08.160 --> 15:14.560
Oh, also another good, another point that was made is by a few folks was that folks

15:14.560 --> 15:20.240
in development shops, rolling releases are no good because if you, if you total, if you,

15:20.240 --> 15:24.560
if like an enterprise, when you write software and then you certify it as something and then

15:24.560 --> 15:28.080
you go to ship it, but the libraries change or something like that, that's a total, you

15:28.080 --> 15:30.200
know, pulling the rug out from underneath the developers.

15:30.200 --> 15:34.720
So they like to have, you know, totally snapshotted in time systems, although technologies like

15:34.720 --> 15:36.320
Docker are alleviating.

15:36.320 --> 15:40.520
I mean, so that's the other thing about this rolling release discussion is there are new

15:40.520 --> 15:44.200
technologies coming out like virtual, well, not, not even coming out like virtualization

15:44.200 --> 15:50.160
with snapshots and Docker and containers that sort of nullify some of the previous pains

15:50.160 --> 15:52.640
with rolling releases.

15:52.640 --> 15:53.640
And we'll just see where that goes.

15:53.640 --> 15:57.360
I wonder if history won't prove me right in the long run because of these types of things

15:57.360 --> 16:01.160
where you can isolate applications off into a safe environment.

16:01.160 --> 16:02.160
I think so.

16:02.160 --> 16:06.760
I think as things evolve with the virtualization technologies specifically, I think we'll eventually

16:06.760 --> 16:11.200
hit that point to where it becomes a mood issue, but I'm not sure we're there yet.

16:11.200 --> 16:14.760
I think there's still enough considerations that people need to really make an educated

16:14.760 --> 16:15.760
decision.

16:15.760 --> 16:18.280
So Jesse writes in, he says, uh, hello Chris and Matt.

16:18.280 --> 16:21.520
I saw your recent Linux unplugged episode on your opinion about Ubuntu going to a rolling

16:21.520 --> 16:22.520
release.

16:22.520 --> 16:25.800
Only I have to completely disagree with all your points.

16:25.800 --> 16:29.440
Last year I switched a few of my teachers to Linux Mint and most of us Linux Mint and

16:29.440 --> 16:34.960
Ubuntu users don't know enough to fix our system if it crashed from an update in a release.

16:34.960 --> 16:39.400
Now you remember one of the things I said is there is this fear of like, I need my distro

16:39.400 --> 16:40.880
master to protect me.

16:40.880 --> 16:45.360
And if I don't have the grand repo keeper checking every package before it hits the

16:45.360 --> 16:50.400
repo, then I, you know, disaster is around the next update.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.400
And I actually agreed on the whole point of it.

16:52.400 --> 16:53.400
Well, I'll get to that after the...

16:53.400 --> 16:54.400
No, go ahead.

16:54.400 --> 16:55.400
You can.

16:55.400 --> 16:58.480
I was just going to basically point out, I said to be completely fair though, I actually

16:58.480 --> 17:01.200
pointed out that it is different strokes for different folks.

17:01.200 --> 17:05.480
There are use case scenarios to where it does not make sense to go rolling release.

17:05.480 --> 17:06.880
Where Jesse's making the case right here.

17:06.880 --> 17:10.760
He says most new Linux users don't want to spend time tweaking their computer to run

17:10.760 --> 17:12.000
the way they like.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.240
Most of them just install the distro and move over their data.

17:14.240 --> 17:18.240
I hate doing this unless I'm re Linuxing, remastering.

17:18.240 --> 17:22.440
Ubuntu is aiming for a new bus user base and rolling release would just turn them off.

17:22.440 --> 17:26.320
Seems that you also forgot that corporate distros helped Linux get off the ground in

17:26.320 --> 17:27.320
the nineties.

17:27.320 --> 17:31.960
I personally don't care about pushing the envelope unless it's base packages.

17:31.960 --> 17:36.600
Also I'm not very savvy and most Linux users are not either.

17:36.600 --> 17:43.400
So where he says here that I hate where Ubuntu is aiming for a new bus user base.

17:43.400 --> 17:45.800
I see people that take offense to that sometimes, but I do agree.

17:45.800 --> 17:48.240
They're trying to, they're trying to do a wide spectrum.

17:48.240 --> 17:52.600
They're doing a wide spectrum and also the whole corporate thing, the corporate stuff.

17:52.600 --> 17:54.680
While I agree that, you know, it's an ancient thing.

17:54.680 --> 17:56.440
A lot of people are using the long-term releases.

17:56.440 --> 17:59.720
So for that, so that's a, that's a completely out of the argument already off the bat.

17:59.720 --> 18:04.080
I think too, like, um, you couldn't, like you would, I think the best approach is sort

18:04.080 --> 18:08.880
of the Debian and open Sousa approaches where you have your stable branch and here's your

18:08.880 --> 18:09.880
rolling branch.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.600
And that's really what I would want.

18:11.600 --> 18:14.000
I mean, that's really how I think they should do it.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.480
I think that absolutely, however they do a stable branches up to them and however they

18:18.480 --> 18:23.280
make that work with the community, but have a stable branch, schools, corporations, nonprofits,

18:23.280 --> 18:26.360
whatnot, or people just don't want something to update all the time.

18:26.360 --> 18:28.680
And then of course, if you want a rolling release, that's available as well.

18:28.680 --> 18:32.640
And that of course will then help with speedier development and less of the release party

18:32.640 --> 18:34.480
and more of just getting it done.

18:34.480 --> 18:35.480
All right.

18:35.480 --> 18:36.480
All right.

18:36.480 --> 18:39.280
Now watch out Matt, because now the flame throwers are fully focused on me.

18:39.280 --> 18:43.080
Ben writes in, he says, Hey Chris, I love all the shows that Jupiter broadcasting, but

18:43.080 --> 18:46.760
during the segment and episode 10 of Linux unplugged, you said you believe valve steam

18:46.760 --> 18:51.960
OS is a sign of them not having confidence in Ubuntu as a desktop platform.

18:51.960 --> 18:55.020
One thing I noticed that no one mentioned is that steam OS isn't necessarily meant for

18:55.020 --> 18:58.640
desktop markets and pretty sure the point of steam OS is making an operating system

18:58.640 --> 19:00.880
as optimized for TV and controller.

19:00.880 --> 19:04.800
In addition for the desktop valve, probably just wants to provide users and OEMs an image

19:04.800 --> 19:08.380
that they can throw onto boxes that start right up into big picture mode without the

19:08.380 --> 19:10.280
overhead of a normal desktop OS.

19:10.280 --> 19:12.800
Anyways, thanks for all the great shows, Ben.

19:12.800 --> 19:16.920
Now we got a lot of emails to this that a lot of people did not agree that in fact,

19:16.920 --> 19:18.880
here was another one.

19:18.880 --> 19:21.280
Michael wrote and he said in the last show you voiced an opinion that valve's decision

19:21.280 --> 19:24.480
to create steam OS was caused by a concern or lack of faith in Ubuntu.

19:24.480 --> 19:29.040
I think we should look at it from valve's perspective.

19:29.040 --> 19:33.280
Why should they say their new console will be running Ubuntu, even if it will?

19:33.280 --> 19:36.400
It will not have an Ubuntu user interface, it will be a console.

19:36.400 --> 19:39.800
You will get steam big picture interface and won't be encouraged to tweak with it.

19:39.800 --> 19:42.880
For all purposes, consoles should be a black box to you.

19:42.880 --> 19:46.320
There's no reason for telling anyone it's running Ubuntu, saying steam OS is also better

19:46.320 --> 19:47.800
from a marketing point of view.

19:47.800 --> 19:50.520
It sounds like something they created and tailored for their console.

19:50.520 --> 19:54.840
To sum up, I don't think valve's move was a vote of no confidence for Ubuntu, but rather

19:54.840 --> 19:59.600
marketing PR decision with a goal of creating a brand with a product without causing confusion

19:59.600 --> 20:00.920
about the real nature of the OS.

20:00.920 --> 20:03.720
Thanks for the great work, Michael.

20:03.720 --> 20:05.440
Well two considerations there.

20:05.440 --> 20:10.020
One as far as the branding and what not, that's easily done with an Ubuntu base, a simple

20:10.020 --> 20:14.900
letter from the Ubuntu developers and basically removing all the trademark material and going

20:14.900 --> 20:16.120
with what you want.

20:16.120 --> 20:19.280
That's already doable with an Ubuntu base, so I don't think that's the whole reason behind

20:19.280 --> 20:20.280
it.

20:20.280 --> 20:23.920
Secondly, it comes down to a fact that by hedging their bets a little bit, taking a

20:23.920 --> 20:27.960
Linux Mint approach like there with the Linux Mint Debian edition, by hedging their bets

20:27.960 --> 20:31.600
and spreading out things a bit, they're not centralized on Ubuntu only.

20:31.600 --> 20:32.600
That's just common sense.

20:32.600 --> 20:33.920
Granted, the branding thing is accurate.

20:33.920 --> 20:37.880
I mean, I agree, but don't put all your eggs in one basket.

20:37.880 --> 20:39.360
That's a dangerous place to be.

20:39.360 --> 20:46.760
I think my point to that was if Canonical had been successful and had really driven

20:46.760 --> 20:52.920
the Ubuntu desktop and as a brand and all that had broken through, it would be a benefit

20:52.920 --> 20:54.480
to say we run on Ubuntu, right?

20:54.480 --> 20:55.480
It would be like a perk.

20:55.480 --> 21:00.040
It would be like a good thing, like runs on Windows, right?

21:00.040 --> 21:05.120
And because that never happened, it was sort of almost better to just sweep the whole Ubuntu

21:05.120 --> 21:06.120
thing under the rug.

21:06.120 --> 21:11.640
I agree though that at most, that's probably a minor factor in the decision process.

21:11.640 --> 21:13.420
Overall, it's about branding.

21:13.420 --> 21:14.620
It's about streamlining.

21:14.620 --> 21:18.840
It's about keeping, it's about reducing confusion.

21:18.840 --> 21:20.120
So I do agree.

21:20.120 --> 21:23.200
I thought about that after I said it and I thought, well, actually there's a few arguments

21:23.200 --> 21:24.200
against it.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.520
So I was glad to see some folks wrote in with that.

21:25.520 --> 21:26.520
So thanks to you guys.

21:26.520 --> 21:32.880
Now, our last email, which is going to kind of in a way kick us into our main topic today,

21:32.880 --> 21:37.240
comes from Matt, but it's a different Matt, but he does have two T's like a gentleman.

21:37.240 --> 21:41.880
He writes, first, hey guys, I just want to correct Chris on something he said on last.

21:41.880 --> 21:45.440
Linux is not the only open source community.

21:45.440 --> 21:46.440
Obviously I think that.

21:46.440 --> 21:51.300
A lot of the BSD code is open source as well, but isn't free software by the definition

21:51.300 --> 21:54.280
of the term that was created by RMS.

21:54.280 --> 21:57.580
It's negative in the freedom dimension.

21:57.580 --> 22:01.920
But his main point was secondly, I've recently become more involved with the BSD community

22:01.920 --> 22:06.280
and they really don't have the types of issues that the Linux community does with egotistical

22:06.280 --> 22:12.040
talking, the blogs and writing something stupid that pisses everyone off.

22:12.040 --> 22:13.480
I actually agree with this.

22:13.480 --> 22:17.480
I wonder if this isn't the time that Linux community as a whole just says these quote

22:17.480 --> 22:21.760
unquote founders, something like, Hey, we get that you've done a lot in the past, but

22:21.760 --> 22:24.800
now that you're part of a problem, but now you're part of the problem and you're not

22:24.800 --> 22:26.000
solving anything.

22:26.000 --> 22:31.600
So please accept that this pat on the back and his heartfelt thanks and go away until,

22:31.600 --> 22:35.960
until you can accept that this thing you created is much bigger than your ego.

22:35.960 --> 22:40.080
I just think people like RMS and market shuttle worth are constantly causing subvert severe

22:40.080 --> 22:45.480
divisions in the wider community and they've reached a point where their contributions

22:45.480 --> 22:52.160
don't outweigh the harm they're causing by creating scenarios where the community attacks

22:52.160 --> 22:54.800
itself.

22:54.800 --> 22:58.800
I look at it, I look at it like a very hyperactive family.

22:58.800 --> 23:03.280
There's a lot of debating going on a lot and even arguing and occasionally some fighting,

23:03.280 --> 23:05.360
but it doesn't mean we stop being a family because of it.

23:05.360 --> 23:06.880
And I think that's really what happens.

23:06.880 --> 23:09.720
Oh, gosh, that makes me feel so warm.

23:09.720 --> 23:11.520
It's like a warm and fuzzy feeling, right?

23:11.520 --> 23:17.520
I almost feel like I don't want to even say what I think because mine is like, well, you

23:17.520 --> 23:20.840
know, okay, so here's what I think.

23:20.840 --> 23:26.160
I think if you, if you really believe the BSD community doesn't have arguments and big

23:26.160 --> 23:28.040
fights you're fooling yourself.

23:28.040 --> 23:29.400
Oh yeah, I'm sure.

23:29.400 --> 23:33.100
What it is is it goes back to what I said during the intro.

23:33.100 --> 23:39.200
It is our bankrupt media coverage of Linux because it is easy to write about the cult

23:39.200 --> 23:42.360
of personality that we have because it draws clicks.

23:42.360 --> 23:43.840
People recognize the name.

23:43.840 --> 23:45.520
People click on the links and read the articles.

23:45.520 --> 23:51.520
When Mark Shuttleworth or Linus Torvalds or RMS's name is in the headline, I do it too.

23:51.520 --> 23:52.520
I'm a dumb monkey.

23:52.520 --> 23:53.520
I click it.

23:53.520 --> 23:54.520
I read it.

23:54.520 --> 23:55.520
And that's why it happens.

23:55.520 --> 23:59.160
Now when somebody in the BSD community does it, you'll hear about it on BSD now, right?

23:59.160 --> 24:01.160
Because that's the media coverage for BSD.

24:01.160 --> 24:07.360
And obviously there's also the BSD talk and other and the BSD blogs, but like there's

24:07.360 --> 24:15.560
not the scale and now industry is maybe not as a strong term, but definitely there is

24:15.560 --> 24:19.080
a forming industry of Linux coverage.

24:19.080 --> 24:24.040
And these people, these people are doing a disservice to the community because they're

24:24.040 --> 24:28.440
lazy and because they're cheap and because you click it.

24:28.440 --> 24:34.400
And because of that, these types of things get extraordinary coverage compared to, for

24:34.400 --> 24:40.160
example today, Aaron Seigo wrote up a long blog post with lots of screenshots about the

24:40.160 --> 24:44.040
future direction of a content delivery platform that's more than an app store.

24:44.040 --> 24:48.840
It's like music and apps and books and open source code delivery and commercial software

24:48.840 --> 24:53.580
delivery that they want to integrate in with like Plasma Active and the KDE desktop.

24:53.580 --> 24:57.160
And they've got this whole backend infrastructure for it that's totally brilliant.

24:57.160 --> 25:00.120
They've got a front end, they've got code they've been working on for the front end

25:00.120 --> 25:03.680
delivery for two years and like he just wrote up all about it.

25:03.680 --> 25:09.700
It's like it's going to be fundamental plumbing for app distributions for like distro agnostic.

25:09.700 --> 25:13.660
It's going to be brilliant and nobody wrote about it.

25:13.660 --> 25:18.880
Nobody wrote about it because everybody's writing about crap.

25:18.880 --> 25:24.180
And I can tell you why as someone in this market is because quite honestly, unless it's

25:24.180 --> 25:28.200
going directly into a subscribed mailing list, no one's going to click it.

25:28.200 --> 25:29.800
No, that's not fair.

25:29.800 --> 25:30.800
Most people won't click it.

25:30.800 --> 25:32.340
The smart people will.

25:32.340 --> 25:36.880
But most people that are just scaling through titles, it's not necessarily going to grab

25:36.880 --> 25:40.000
your attention unless it was done really, really well.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.520
I mean like we're talking Star Wars type titles, it's got to be really good.

25:43.520 --> 25:48.520
And that's hard to do especially with something like that because it covers so much ground.

25:48.520 --> 25:53.360
And it doesn't have the click through rate of a – here's the top 10 reasons why you're

25:53.360 --> 25:54.360
sick of reading these articles.

25:54.360 --> 25:55.360
Well, so –

25:55.360 --> 25:56.360
You know, that sort of thing.

25:56.360 --> 25:59.480
You know, Lass has a seven plus year history of following the news.

25:59.480 --> 26:02.800
You've been a writer for years and writing in this space.

26:02.800 --> 26:06.700
So I want to talk about this today because this is something that has literally been

26:06.700 --> 26:09.580
bothering me for really more than a year, but definitely for the last year.

26:09.580 --> 26:11.580
But first I want to tell everybody about something great.

26:11.580 --> 26:13.960
So let's just focus on the good stuff.

26:13.960 --> 26:16.600
And that is this week's sponsor, Ting.com.

26:16.600 --> 26:17.600
That's right, friends.

26:17.600 --> 26:18.600
Ting is mobile.

26:18.600 --> 26:19.600
That makes sense.

26:19.600 --> 26:22.580
Now there are millions of reasons to switch to Ting.

26:22.580 --> 26:24.800
So I want to tell you about just a few of them this episode.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.280
Number one, no contracts.

26:26.280 --> 26:27.640
No early termination fees.

26:27.640 --> 26:28.720
And here's the third one.

26:28.720 --> 26:29.840
Brace yourselves.

26:29.840 --> 26:31.400
Pay for what you use.

26:31.400 --> 26:32.560
Pay for what you use.

26:32.560 --> 26:36.400
In the past, the only way to do pay for what you use is you had some sort of super special

26:36.400 --> 26:39.560
deal with some monopoly carrier through your company.

26:39.560 --> 26:43.280
If you ever left your job or that deal ended, there went your sweet deal.

26:43.280 --> 26:47.280
No, Ting lets you take that power into your own hands literally.

26:47.280 --> 26:52.840
So if you go to linux.ting.com, you're going to take $25 off your first month of service

26:52.840 --> 26:54.440
or your first device.

26:54.440 --> 26:55.440
Lots of devices you can bring.

26:55.440 --> 26:59.160
If you go over to the Ting help blog, the Ting help page, you can find out what devices

26:59.160 --> 27:00.160
you can bring.

27:00.160 --> 27:01.160
They also have a concierge service.

27:01.160 --> 27:06.360
So you can get onto Ting with your own device, with a device they find for you, or a brand

27:06.360 --> 27:08.760
new device that you own outright.

27:08.760 --> 27:13.000
Now on top of the pay for what you use, on top of their excellent customer service, when

27:13.000 --> 27:18.280
you call 1-855-846-4389, and a real Canadian answers the phone.

27:18.280 --> 27:22.560
On top of all of that, they also have built in hotspot and tethering with every device

27:22.560 --> 27:23.560
you grab.

27:23.560 --> 27:27.880
So if you need Wi-Fi for a group of folks, and you know, if you're on one of these other

27:27.880 --> 27:30.860
carriers, you know you've got that checkbox, if they haven't removed it, you've got that

27:30.860 --> 27:34.800
checkbox in your Android settings, and man, you just wish you could just check that box

27:34.800 --> 27:36.360
and wouldn't have to pay anything extra.

27:36.360 --> 27:37.360
But you know they'll get you.

27:37.360 --> 27:40.760
Maybe you've got to get the family share plan like I had to get a long time ago.

27:40.760 --> 27:43.640
It's so ridiculous, Ting eliminates all of that.

27:43.640 --> 27:44.640
They eliminate all of that.

27:44.640 --> 27:50.660
Plus they have a savings calculator, if you're kind of on the fence, you go to linux.ting.com,

27:50.660 --> 27:54.000
click on that savings calculator, put your bill information in there, and then just look

27:54.000 --> 27:55.400
at the raw savings.

27:55.400 --> 27:59.680
Now consider this, consider this, Ting is making it better than ever to switch.

27:59.680 --> 28:02.700
Not only do they have the golden ticket program right now, and this is only until the end

28:02.700 --> 28:06.960
of October, so it's almost over, where they're giving out six tickets for a year of service

28:06.960 --> 28:07.960
for Ting.

28:07.960 --> 28:09.520
Even if you bring your own device, you can still get one of these.

28:09.520 --> 28:14.040
They also have introduced their early termination relief program where they give you up to $75

28:14.040 --> 28:16.440
per line that you have to cancel to switch to Ting.

28:16.440 --> 28:20.280
Now we're really starting to talk here, because if you're like me, I think the highest bill

28:20.280 --> 28:25.240
I've ever had, I think my highest bill, even when both Ange and I were on it, was like

28:25.240 --> 28:26.240
$24.

28:26.240 --> 28:27.240
$25.

28:27.240 --> 28:28.240
That's nothing.

28:28.240 --> 28:29.240
Yeah, that's crazy.

28:29.240 --> 28:30.240
She and I are both big data.

28:30.240 --> 28:32.780
We text, we do the web, but we don't do a ton of phone.

28:32.780 --> 28:35.520
But if I did a ton of phone one month, then I'll only pay for what I use.

28:35.520 --> 28:39.600
I don't end up paying into some plan, if you can call it that.

28:39.600 --> 28:40.600
I don't know why they call it a plan.

28:40.600 --> 28:41.600
I didn't plan that.

28:41.600 --> 28:46.400
You don't have to pay some huge plan for something you don't end up using.

28:46.400 --> 28:50.160
Go over to the Ting devices page, and while you're there, check out their new devices.

28:50.160 --> 28:51.160
They've got the Moto X.

28:51.160 --> 28:54.000
They've even got the Windows Phone, if you're of that variety.

28:54.000 --> 28:59.760
They've got the HTC One now with the Android 4.3, which is rocking, and they have the pre-order

28:59.760 --> 29:01.560
up for the new Note 3, Matt.

29:01.560 --> 29:02.560
Woo!

29:02.560 --> 29:03.560
Man, I'm looking at that.

29:03.560 --> 29:06.520
I love what I got now, but I would definitely love to go that direction.

29:06.520 --> 29:12.200
And if you wanted to get in brand new for a crazy, crazy good deal, go check out the

29:12.200 --> 29:15.600
Kyocera Kona, 63 bones with our discount.

29:15.600 --> 29:19.200
That's like the perfect backup phone, right?

29:19.200 --> 29:23.200
So first of all, since you only pay for what you use, put this in the glove box.

29:23.200 --> 29:24.200
Exactly.

29:24.200 --> 29:27.400
Put it in the glove box and let it sit there, and if you ever have an emergency, you've

29:27.400 --> 29:28.760
got a phone that's ready to go.

29:28.760 --> 29:33.280
Not only does this thing have days of battery life, days of battery life, but it makes crystal

29:33.280 --> 29:34.360
clear phone calls.

29:34.360 --> 29:36.040
So that's a serious option.

29:36.040 --> 29:38.960
They also have used devices, and I want to stress this.

29:38.960 --> 29:41.120
Ting has really great customer service.

29:41.120 --> 29:44.600
If you want to take advantage of their concierge service to find you a used device, you can

29:44.600 --> 29:45.600
do it.

29:45.600 --> 29:47.960
But if you want to get in on a Nexus S, check this out.

29:47.960 --> 29:53.680
Unlocked, you own it outright with no early termination fees, no contract, Samsung Nexus

29:53.680 --> 30:01.280
S with Android 4.1, $245, and you've got WiMAX in your area.

30:01.280 --> 30:02.440
It's going to rock that, too.

30:02.440 --> 30:06.360
You've also got the Samsung Galaxy S3, which has a little bit less of the Samsung bloatware

30:06.360 --> 30:10.920
than the S4, 385 bones, you own it outright, no contract, no early termination fees.

30:10.920 --> 30:11.920
What?

30:11.920 --> 30:12.920
Love it?

30:12.920 --> 30:13.920
It's crazy.

30:13.920 --> 30:14.920
I know.

30:14.920 --> 30:15.920
Absolutely.

30:15.920 --> 30:19.160
So go over to linux.ting.com, grab yourself something nice, and take advantage of that

30:19.160 --> 30:23.480
early termination relief program if you need to, and maybe you'll even get a golden ticket.

30:23.480 --> 30:25.160
Yeah, buddy.

30:25.160 --> 30:27.480
So thanks to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

30:27.480 --> 30:29.800
I mean, how cool is that golden ticket program?

30:29.800 --> 30:30.800
That is so cool.

30:30.800 --> 30:36.200
When's the last time any other carrier's given you a gold in anything?

30:36.200 --> 30:37.200
Especially a ticket.

30:37.200 --> 30:38.200
No kidding.

30:38.200 --> 30:39.200
No kidding.

30:39.200 --> 30:41.880
And I just feel like we need more Willy Wonka out there.

30:41.880 --> 30:42.880
That's right.

30:42.880 --> 30:43.880
Yeah.

30:43.880 --> 30:48.000
So the thing, I'm calling it the bankrupt news industry around Linux because I feel

30:48.000 --> 30:50.480
like I've watched it devolve into crap.

30:50.480 --> 30:54.180
We had three news stories last week, on last, right?

30:54.180 --> 30:55.180
We had the...

30:55.180 --> 30:56.180
Exactly.

30:56.180 --> 30:57.180
Or maybe it was four.

30:57.180 --> 30:58.180
It might have been four.

30:58.180 --> 30:59.180
I mean, they all kind of blood together.

30:59.180 --> 31:00.180
Yeah.

31:00.180 --> 31:04.720
But the big one was, the big story was Mark Shuttleworth, branded people that disagree

31:04.720 --> 31:08.800
with him, the open source tea party, Aaron Seigo took to G+, Lenart Pottering took to

31:08.800 --> 31:10.920
G+, to respond.

31:10.920 --> 31:14.300
That was the really big story of last week, right?

31:14.300 --> 31:17.200
That was sort of like, I mean, it got coverage everywhere.

31:17.200 --> 31:19.020
It was our top story.

31:19.020 --> 31:22.760
And what, gosh, you know what really upsets me is, and how do you, do you know how do

31:22.760 --> 31:24.280
you say Bruce, is it Byfield?

31:24.280 --> 31:25.280
Bruce Byfield?

31:25.280 --> 31:26.280
Byfield, yeah.

31:26.280 --> 31:27.280
Yeah.

31:27.280 --> 31:32.120
Bruce Byfield wrote a great piece back in November 8th of 2012, kind of inspired by

31:32.120 --> 31:35.880
a post that actually Aaron Seigo had made on his blog, but I really liked Bruce's take

31:35.880 --> 31:36.880
on it here.

31:36.880 --> 31:41.360
He says, he took on the, what he's calling the cults of personality that often dominate

31:41.360 --> 31:43.880
the free software community.

31:43.880 --> 31:45.840
And of course, you know, we think of Linus, right?

31:45.840 --> 31:46.840
We think of Mark.

31:46.840 --> 31:47.840
Yeah.

31:47.840 --> 31:54.080
In fact, huge news, breaking news, everybody stand by, we all need to stop what we're doing.

31:54.080 --> 31:55.720
Linus has insulted Fedora.

31:55.720 --> 32:00.840
I've been waiting for him to, no, I've not, but I've been waiting for him to insult AMD.

32:00.840 --> 32:01.840
That's what I'm-

32:01.840 --> 32:02.840
I know, right?

32:02.840 --> 32:03.840
Yeah.

32:03.840 --> 32:04.840
That's the joke.

32:04.840 --> 32:07.560
But that's the joke now is, well, Linus puts his middle finger up and people jump.

32:07.560 --> 32:12.660
But if you look at it, so yeah, so Linus Torvalds goes after the Fedora project this week and

32:12.660 --> 32:15.080
calls him stupid.

32:15.080 --> 32:17.320
I saw this transpire on G Plus in real time.

32:17.320 --> 32:19.440
I was on G Plus when Linus made the post.

32:19.440 --> 32:21.200
I think it even happened before last.

32:21.200 --> 32:25.040
And I read it and I went, oh, okay, well, so Linus thinks that Fedora should generate

32:25.040 --> 32:26.420
new ISOs periodically.

32:26.420 --> 32:30.400
That way when you grab an ISO, you don't have super out of date packages.

32:30.400 --> 32:31.460
I agree with that.

32:31.460 --> 32:32.460
I agree with that.

32:32.460 --> 32:36.240
I think really why make a thing about it, but whatever, I agree with this statement.

32:36.240 --> 32:40.040
And then the Fedora project responds, oh, well, once we generate the ISOs, we don't

32:40.040 --> 32:41.040
touch them.

32:41.040 --> 32:42.040
Those are the snapshot of the release.

32:42.040 --> 32:46.040
And then we do updates and then Linus jumps back in and says, that's ridiculous.

32:46.040 --> 32:47.680
And then they say, well, we don't have QA for the image.

32:47.680 --> 32:52.520
It was this big back and forth, but I saw the thing and I thought, okay, no big deal,

32:52.520 --> 32:53.520
right?

32:53.520 --> 32:54.520
Well, no.

32:54.520 --> 32:55.520
Huge deal.

32:55.520 --> 32:58.240
Huge deal in the Linux media.

32:58.240 --> 33:03.680
Softpedia has an article up, every news site that pretends to cover Linux has an article

33:03.680 --> 33:08.400
up about Linus Torvalds smashing the Fedora project, calls them stupid, right?

33:08.400 --> 33:10.560
And it plays into this whole cult of personality.

33:10.560 --> 33:17.760
It perpetuates this, well, circle jerk of the celebrities in the Linux community.

33:17.760 --> 33:18.760
Exactly.

33:18.760 --> 33:20.360
Well, and so here's the thing.

33:20.360 --> 33:24.680
A lot of people have to realize that the cult of personality you see in a lot of the reality

33:24.680 --> 33:28.920
TV stuff bleeds through into the written word as well.

33:28.920 --> 33:34.760
And so you need something to basically scrape together to make these news stories out of,

33:34.760 --> 33:40.000
especially when you're living in a big vacuum of things that don't present themselves well

33:40.000 --> 33:41.520
to the masses.

33:41.520 --> 33:42.960
They're important instances.

33:42.960 --> 33:46.360
There's important things that are happening, but they're not always real easy to throw

33:46.360 --> 33:50.120
into a title and guarantee a lot of click-throughs, which of course will then generate revenue.

33:50.120 --> 33:53.080
And that's why these things tend to do really well.

33:53.080 --> 33:54.080
Note the words in that title.

33:54.080 --> 33:58.440
If you want to bring that back up on the screen for a second, the words smash, Linus, these

33:58.440 --> 33:59.440
are not done.

33:59.440 --> 34:02.340
These words are carefully chosen, put together to know.

34:02.340 --> 34:05.880
So when you glance at this, even if you don't know who Linus is, the odds are you might

34:05.880 --> 34:09.160
actually click through just out of curiosity to see what this Linus guy is smashing.

34:09.160 --> 34:10.160
Right.

34:10.160 --> 34:11.160
He's smashing a project.

34:11.160 --> 34:12.720
He calls that project stupid.

34:12.720 --> 34:13.720
Definitely.

34:13.720 --> 34:18.520
And plus, you get a picture of Linus in there and what every writer loves.

34:18.520 --> 34:23.040
You get a few choice quotes to pull that you put in there, and then you just couch those

34:23.040 --> 34:28.400
quotes around some sort of minimal write-up, and then you get a few thousand views or whatever

34:28.400 --> 34:30.140
he gets for this.

34:30.140 --> 34:35.400
And of course, the beauty of this is all you got to do is follow Linus on G+, or watch

34:35.400 --> 34:40.260
Hacker News or something like that, and then it's like a story falls in your lap.

34:40.260 --> 34:43.640
It's like Christmas time for the writer.

34:43.640 --> 34:45.000
And Bruce tackles this.

34:45.000 --> 34:49.200
Bruce says that these cults of personality are contrary to community values, whereas

34:49.200 --> 34:54.120
they do untold damage imposing commercial values at the cost of community ones, or dividing

34:54.120 --> 34:57.840
the community as those at the center of such cults decide to air their personal grudges

34:57.840 --> 34:58.840
in public.

34:58.840 --> 34:59.840
Now, he wrote this in 2012.

34:59.840 --> 35:01.960
We just saw this happen over just this weekend.

35:01.960 --> 35:05.960
He says they can cause people to discard their own judgment and choose software on the basis

35:05.960 --> 35:11.120
of who endorses what, and even to compromise themselves morally by choosing sides in a

35:11.120 --> 35:16.080
flame war when they should be condemning everyone involved.

35:16.080 --> 35:21.600
And I actually, when I came in, myself and of course the Ubuntu community manager came

35:21.600 --> 35:26.000
in to actually address this when a lot of this stuff was going back and forth, we were

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
instantly attacked.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.660
It's like, oh my gosh, this sort of thing.

35:30.660 --> 35:35.440
It's unfortunate that we've come to that because we're feeding the problem and quite frankly

35:35.440 --> 35:39.580
showing the writers that write this stuff that this is where you need to go.

35:39.580 --> 35:42.200
And here's another reason why this is not only going to continue, but it's going to

35:42.200 --> 35:43.200
get worse.

35:43.200 --> 35:44.480
And a lot of people don't realize this.

35:44.480 --> 35:50.920
Because of Google's constant algorithm changes, especially with their latest one, SEO is kind

35:50.920 --> 35:53.920
of dying, I hate – I mean, in my opinion, I think.

35:53.920 --> 35:54.920
And so because –

35:54.920 --> 35:55.920
Yeah.

35:55.920 --> 35:56.920
Google said they want to kill SEO.

35:56.920 --> 36:01.940
So rather than having reasons why something's awesome or something that has long-term value

36:01.940 --> 36:04.760
in SEO, that's basically going the way of the dodo.

36:04.760 --> 36:08.320
So you're – basically it's all or nothing in quick hits.

36:08.320 --> 36:12.240
You got to publish often, got to have lots of content, and it has to have great titles.

36:12.240 --> 36:14.720
Get people in, get people in, get people in, and it's got to continue.

36:14.720 --> 36:15.720
Right.

36:15.720 --> 36:18.320
And the other thing is all of these writers are under big deadlines.

36:18.320 --> 36:22.680
And like Bruce points out, the problem is that journalism, as it's practiced today,

36:22.680 --> 36:25.480
finds cults of personality to be extremely convenient.

36:25.480 --> 36:29.480
Being able to just mention a celebrity in the headline guarantees you get increased

36:29.480 --> 36:30.480
page views.

36:30.480 --> 36:31.480
That's right.

36:31.480 --> 36:34.400
And that, of course, means that the writer is still employed and, of course, the website

36:34.400 --> 36:35.400
remains up.

36:35.400 --> 36:38.980
And he also says it's convenient for the writer because instead of having to go out

36:38.980 --> 36:44.040
of their way to back up their facts, if they mention someone famous, then it validates

36:44.040 --> 36:45.040
their point.

36:45.040 --> 36:49.280
Even if the celebrity fails to make a logical argument or offer a scrap of insight, readers

36:49.280 --> 36:53.560
are more likely to be swayed by a viewpoint by learning that a celebrity, quote, unquote,

36:53.560 --> 36:54.560
supports it.

36:54.560 --> 36:55.560
Exactly.

36:55.560 --> 37:00.080
And this – so one of the deciding facts – so I put Plan B on hiatus, even though

37:00.080 --> 37:03.760
I'm – I think I'm still very fascinated by Bitcoin.

37:03.760 --> 37:09.200
The problem what I saw happening was is sort of all of these bankrupt values being translated

37:09.200 --> 37:16.240
over to Bitcoin where people who really had no business being quoted in a legitimate news

37:16.240 --> 37:17.640
article were quoted.

37:17.640 --> 37:24.560
And people who I knew to be sort of posers, quote, unquote, were writing articles talking

37:24.560 --> 37:25.840
about how great something was.

37:25.840 --> 37:27.400
And I see this all the time.

37:27.400 --> 37:30.440
You know, in the history of the Linux Action Show, seven plus years, I have met a lot

37:30.440 --> 37:34.240
of the people – I know a lot of the people behind these articles, and I know that some

37:34.240 --> 37:39.260
of them never use Linux more than just starting it up on a VM on their Mac.

37:39.260 --> 37:43.400
And that is, they're a total extent with Linux, and then they go on to write reviews

37:43.400 --> 37:49.720
about, you know, new releases and all of this stuff, and it's totally ungenuine, but it

37:49.720 --> 37:54.680
is all about they know how to phrase it, they have a bit of an established audience, and

37:54.680 --> 37:58.200
they know how to get people to click on their stuff, and they know how to write vaguely

37:58.200 --> 38:02.280
enough that you can't pin them down for not actually having enough experience.

38:02.280 --> 38:07.240
And so while the write-up tends to be vapid with very little content, very little actual

38:07.240 --> 38:13.720
value, because the state of Linux media coverage is so poor and so weak, it gets play.

38:13.720 --> 38:14.720
Exactly.

38:14.720 --> 38:15.720
And that's just it.

38:15.720 --> 38:19.440
And then you bundle that in with the fact that Linux is kind of coming into its own.

38:19.440 --> 38:22.680
We're kind of at a lull right now because the gaming thing already happened.

38:22.680 --> 38:24.920
The cloud stuff's already kind of doing its thing.

38:24.920 --> 38:29.640
It's not really, you know, something that you can put into easy-to-understand terms

38:29.640 --> 38:31.480
for the masses.

38:31.480 --> 38:36.000
So there's a lot of play there for just fluff, and it's going to continue to get worse.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.760
I really believe that.

38:37.760 --> 38:44.200
He says, Bruce goes on to say that even a writer is not above from stooping to, however,

38:44.200 --> 38:48.440
even when the writer is not stooping to such tactics, like we covered for us, for example,

38:48.440 --> 38:51.800
you know, last tries not to get sucked into this, but we covered the Shuttleworth story

38:51.800 --> 38:52.800
because...

38:52.800 --> 38:53.960
And we had to.

38:53.960 --> 38:54.960
It's news.

38:54.960 --> 38:57.720
Like the audience, there is an expectation in the audience that you're going to talk

38:57.720 --> 39:00.720
about, especially in that case, because we were drawn into it.

39:00.720 --> 39:03.840
The Linux action show was actually drawn into the discussion, so it was like there's even

39:03.840 --> 39:05.260
more impetus to discuss it.

39:05.260 --> 39:08.280
But readers want, he goes on to say, readers want to hear about what famous people are

39:08.280 --> 39:09.280
doing or thinking.

39:09.280 --> 39:13.280
They are far less interested in ordinary people, which is why stories about people behind the

39:13.280 --> 39:17.840
scenes, while often well-meaning, rarely keep people reading unless the writer can quickly

39:17.840 --> 39:20.680
establish an interesting angle.

39:20.680 --> 39:21.760
I think that's also really true.

39:21.760 --> 39:26.840
It's like there's sort of this market pressure to play into this whole cult of personalities.

39:26.840 --> 39:31.960
But what we get is this really watered down coverage of the open source community where

39:31.960 --> 39:34.120
it looks like we're constantly bickering.

39:34.120 --> 39:36.560
It looks like we're immature, we can't come together.

39:36.560 --> 39:40.360
Even when there's great code being made, there's great strides that are being accomplished,

39:40.360 --> 39:42.560
it sort of, it gets lost in the noise.

39:42.560 --> 39:43.560
Right.

39:43.560 --> 39:44.560
That's exactly it.

39:44.560 --> 39:49.040
I mean, I remember back in the day where, you know, Bruce could do a really in-depth

39:49.040 --> 39:55.440
analysis of Gnome, for example, and really dive in deep, or I could do some crazy futuristic

39:55.440 --> 39:59.440
Futurama think piece, you know, just having fun with, here's the existing technology,

39:59.440 --> 40:02.400
here's where I think it's going to go, here's some considerations, blah, blah, blah.

40:02.400 --> 40:05.040
Something that might actually be possibly entertaining, worth reading.

40:05.040 --> 40:08.400
And now we're trapped in this space to where that's no longer possible, and I don't know

40:08.400 --> 40:09.880
where that's going to lead.

40:09.880 --> 40:10.880
Yeah.

40:10.880 --> 40:13.280
I've pulled back a lot myself, honestly, so.

40:13.280 --> 40:14.280
Yeah.

40:14.280 --> 40:17.480
I think it's, I mean, and you've seen it from, you know, both angles where, you know, you've

40:17.480 --> 40:20.520
been, you know, you've told me that people come to me and say, okay, well, Matt, we want

40:20.520 --> 40:21.520
you to write about this.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.400
You know, like, I'm not really interested in writing about that.

40:23.400 --> 40:24.400
Why would you want me to write about that?

40:24.400 --> 40:28.800
And so, you know, well, we want another top 10 article, or we want something for our slideshow

40:28.800 --> 40:31.960
because we get X amount of ad revenue by the slideshow.

40:31.960 --> 40:32.960
Exactly.

40:32.960 --> 40:38.680
And I feel like here we are now, a year after Bruce wrote that piece that I just read, and

40:38.680 --> 40:39.680
it goes on more.

40:39.680 --> 40:42.960
I'll have both Aaron and Bruce's piece linked in the show notes.

40:42.960 --> 40:46.040
So this week, tuxmachines.org went up for sale.

40:46.040 --> 40:47.040
Yeah.

40:47.040 --> 40:48.040
It's coming.

40:48.040 --> 40:49.040
I actually knew about it.

40:49.040 --> 40:51.640
Phronix.com has been up for sale a couple of times.

40:51.640 --> 40:54.300
The H Online is shut down, right?

40:54.300 --> 41:01.060
And so what we have here is either A, sites that couldn't make it work, even though they

41:01.060 --> 41:06.480
had original content, or B, we have the elimination of some really good writing, like from the

41:06.480 --> 41:07.480
H Online.

41:07.480 --> 41:08.480
Yeah.

41:08.480 --> 41:10.720
And what we get left with is blog spam.

41:10.720 --> 41:11.720
Right.

41:11.720 --> 41:17.320
And what I see happening is I see companies, you know, like Network World and other companies

41:17.320 --> 41:22.760
out there that are really just sort of half-heartedly getting involved, like they have an open source

41:22.760 --> 41:28.040
back page where they have people writing for that, you know, just write us something adorable.

41:28.040 --> 41:31.240
We'll put it up, and maybe it'll get a few upvotes on Reddit, and then people will come

41:31.240 --> 41:32.240
read it.

41:32.240 --> 41:36.040
You know, it's like this total half-assed, half-hearted attempt to cover the industry.

41:36.040 --> 41:40.240
Meanwhile, Linux is seeing more adoption than we've ever seen in the history of the platform.

41:40.240 --> 41:44.400
We have more people using it in terms of mobile, on the cloud, and on the desktop, but yet

41:44.400 --> 41:49.360
the writing and coverage of it has never been weaker or poorer, and it is so disappointing

41:49.360 --> 41:50.360
to see this happen.

41:50.360 --> 41:51.360
It is.

41:51.360 --> 41:55.340
And, well, and the other side of it, too, is that you have two types of writers.

41:55.340 --> 41:58.440
You have the writer that basically has to get approval for a topic.

41:58.440 --> 42:01.920
Usually we present two or three to the editor, and then one of them is selected.

42:01.920 --> 42:05.300
And then a lot of times none of them are selected, and we do have to settle for a top ten.

42:05.300 --> 42:10.400
Or you have the person who is a syndicated writer, and these are my favorite, the Dvoraks

42:10.400 --> 42:14.920
of the world, for a better example, that will go out, and because they're so burnt out,

42:14.920 --> 42:15.920
they don't care.

42:15.920 --> 42:18.120
They're literally just cranking out crap because they're done.

42:18.120 --> 42:19.120
They're done.

42:19.120 --> 42:20.360
They mentally checked out a long time ago.

42:20.360 --> 42:24.800
They figured out what buttons to push to generate enough links to meet what that site needs

42:24.800 --> 42:26.400
to keep them around.

42:26.400 --> 42:30.520
You know, and like Big C points out, you see this definitely happen on Slashdot and all

42:30.520 --> 42:31.520
the sites.

42:31.520 --> 42:35.840
But you know, it's interesting, in all of this, and I think it's of some note, to keep

42:35.840 --> 42:41.880
in perspective, LinuxLWN.net, LinuxWeekly.net, you know, a reader-supported news site, dedicating

42:41.880 --> 42:47.200
to really producing deep coverage, which I've never found to be exceptionally compelling

42:47.200 --> 42:50.400
myself, but totally respect the type of coverage that it is.

42:50.400 --> 42:51.400
They're still around.

42:51.400 --> 42:55.160
I don't know how they're doing, but I'm pleased they're still around, and I feel like you

42:55.160 --> 43:00.080
touched on it, like what I want as a Linux user and a follower of this industry, and

43:00.080 --> 43:04.400
I would want this even if I was ten times less involved with the Linux community.

43:04.400 --> 43:09.740
If I was just following Linux news because I had sent OS servers deployed on my servers

43:09.740 --> 43:15.460
at work, I would still want thought-provoking articles that are, you know, deep discussions

43:15.460 --> 43:21.600
about things that are going on right now, that are well-done analysis, that go much

43:21.600 --> 43:26.840
further beyond just the surface coverage, this top-level coverage we get now.

43:26.840 --> 43:28.560
And LWN.net does exactly that.

43:28.560 --> 43:31.240
They just don't happen to do it about things that I'm particularly passionate about.

43:31.240 --> 43:34.880
Well, and the other side of that, too, because this is a great example.

43:34.880 --> 43:39.360
They're still around because, of course, their expectations are not, you know, probably not

43:39.360 --> 43:42.020
monetary in any way other than server cost.

43:42.020 --> 43:44.240
They're sure it's volunteer authors and so on and so forth.

43:44.240 --> 43:49.480
And I think even, was it opensource.com, I believe now, the Red Hat group, actually,

43:49.480 --> 43:50.480
they do a lot of volunteer stuff.

43:50.480 --> 43:53.820
I think a lot of the volunteer sites tend to do pretty well because the expectation,

43:53.820 --> 43:56.840
people are doing it for the fun of it because they're passionate about it, maybe even just

43:56.840 --> 43:58.760
to get their name out there.

43:58.760 --> 43:59.760
But –

43:59.760 --> 44:00.760
Yeah, there are a few efforts.

44:00.760 --> 44:01.760
Yeah, there are a few.

44:01.760 --> 44:05.040
And opensource.com is lucky because they have a benefactor that, you know, Red Hat that

44:05.040 --> 44:06.040
–

44:06.040 --> 44:07.040
Right.

44:07.040 --> 44:08.040
But it's all volunteer writers.

44:08.040 --> 44:10.880
I mean, these guys are – unless it's an employee of the company, but most of them

44:10.880 --> 44:11.880
are just volunteer writers.

44:11.880 --> 44:15.800
And that's interesting that they're able to produce as well as they do for volunteers

44:15.800 --> 44:20.360
because honestly, once the notoriety wears off as a volunteer, you kind of burn out pretty

44:20.360 --> 44:25.120
quick because after a while, you find that you have X number of hours in the day and

44:25.120 --> 44:26.120
you want to spend it elsewhere.

44:26.120 --> 44:27.120
So –

44:27.120 --> 44:30.160
I think Chatham is misinterpreting, so I want to correct because I'm sure some of the listeners.

44:30.160 --> 44:31.160
Sure.

44:31.160 --> 44:33.480
I don't mean that LWN isn't compelling.

44:33.480 --> 44:37.360
I guess what I mean is like, I'm never like compelled –

44:37.360 --> 44:38.880
The topics aren't maybe hitting it for you?

44:38.880 --> 44:39.880
I mean –

44:39.880 --> 44:40.880
Like, they're good.

44:40.880 --> 44:44.760
Like, optimizing CPU hot plug logging, locking is interesting, a new direction for power

44:44.760 --> 44:47.000
where scheduling, rationalizing Python packaging –

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
Pretty hyper-specific, yeah.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
Yeah.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.160
And just not particular topics.

44:51.160 --> 44:56.080
I mean, but, you know, I probably find myself on the site about once a week, you know, reading

44:56.080 --> 45:00.600
something, but I would really like some deeper stuff.

45:00.600 --> 45:01.600
And I feel like –

45:01.600 --> 45:02.600
Sure.

45:02.600 --> 45:04.920
There are – you know, there are – like, you just pointed out two good examples.

45:04.920 --> 45:08.720
You know, opensource.com is one of them where there's some that are beginning, but it's

45:08.720 --> 45:13.760
still so far and the resources are still so thin and the market pressures are so high

45:13.760 --> 45:15.040
on this problem.

45:15.040 --> 45:18.960
Like, this is a trend that's been going on for a few years now and I really feel like

45:18.960 --> 45:22.720
I've been witnessing the decline as the host of the Linux Action Show, just like, watching

45:22.720 --> 45:24.720
the news every single week, you know.

45:24.720 --> 45:26.240
You and I, we sit here and go, what are we going to cover?

45:26.240 --> 45:29.720
And we watch it all week and then at the end of the week, we kind of – we literally take

45:29.720 --> 45:33.200
it all in and then say, okay, well, this meets the cut.

45:33.200 --> 45:38.440
And every single week, that – for a while now, like, that list is getting shorter and

45:38.440 --> 45:39.440
shorter.

45:39.440 --> 45:43.000
And in the last week, in the last couple of weeks, it's been shockingly small.

45:43.000 --> 45:44.820
Like, so much so.

45:44.820 --> 45:46.960
And unfortunately, the noise ratio hasn't gone down.

45:46.960 --> 45:47.960
That's true.

45:47.960 --> 45:50.280
There's still horrible things being written and posted on the blogs and all these other

45:50.280 --> 45:51.280
places.

45:51.280 --> 45:52.280
So it's so disappointing to watch it happen.

45:52.280 --> 45:57.120
Well, and I also think it fills in the gap a little bit for the lack of actual news.

45:57.120 --> 46:01.600
I mean, we need more, you know, Dell dumps Windows forever and goes nothing but Linux

46:01.600 --> 46:05.500
or, you know, some crazy stories like that to where it's like really big compelling

46:05.500 --> 46:08.160
stuff like what we saw with Valve and gaming.

46:08.160 --> 46:10.560
We need more of that to drown out the noise.

46:10.560 --> 46:11.560
You know what I mean?

46:11.560 --> 46:15.760
So here would be a great example because ZooX is asking for kind of maybe like an example

46:15.760 --> 46:22.000
is while this whole Shuttleworth kerfuffle is blowing up around Mir and Upstart and System

46:22.000 --> 46:27.000
3 and all these things, wouldn't it be awesome to have like this like New York Times style

46:27.000 --> 46:31.480
article with like, here is like the whole backstory, here's all of the stuff, here's

46:31.480 --> 46:35.120
when this stuff happened, here's the people behind it, here's their goals.

46:35.120 --> 46:39.460
Like this whole, like if there was just one spot you could go to and be completely up

46:39.460 --> 46:44.560
to date on this whole kerfuffle and like get the timelines right and get the motivations

46:44.560 --> 46:49.880
and you know, and have it be impartial third party documentation of it.

46:49.880 --> 46:53.280
Because really, and I don't mean to toot our own horn right now, but one of the best ways

46:53.280 --> 46:56.720
to get that is just to watch the entire back catalog of the Linux action show and then

46:56.720 --> 46:58.680
you can just organically watch it come together.

46:58.680 --> 47:00.840
But that's not how it should be.

47:00.840 --> 47:04.960
Because quite honestly to get a writer to actually go that deep into something and to

47:04.960 --> 47:10.480
do it right for that article alone, honestly, I can't see anyone doing it for less than

47:10.480 --> 47:11.480
a grand.

47:11.480 --> 47:12.480
I know.

47:12.480 --> 47:13.480
Maybe two.

47:13.480 --> 47:14.480
This is the problem.

47:14.480 --> 47:15.480
This is the problem.

47:15.480 --> 47:16.480
Yeah.

47:16.480 --> 47:18.720
The internet makes things cheap and people don't, unless you've been involved in the

47:18.720 --> 47:21.040
industry, people don't know the actual like.

47:21.040 --> 47:24.160
And two is probably not enough, honestly, because it's going to be quite a job.

47:24.160 --> 47:25.160
Yeah.

47:25.160 --> 47:26.160
Yeah.

47:26.160 --> 47:27.160
So, you know, just, I don't know.

47:27.160 --> 47:28.160
I don't know.

47:28.160 --> 47:31.000
Maybe if the mumble room has any thoughts on this, if you guys have, maybe you've noticed

47:31.000 --> 47:35.220
an improvement in Linux news, if you've noticed a decline in Linux news, if this concerns

47:35.220 --> 47:37.640
you guys or doesn't concern you, if anybody has any thoughts and want to chime in before

47:37.640 --> 47:43.160
we move on, you are, the floor is open to you to do so.

47:43.160 --> 47:50.280
Well, the paraphrase, the great philosopher of our time, Jessie J, from her infinitely

47:50.280 --> 47:58.960
deep poem, Price Tag, again, I'm paraphrasing here, all about the cha-ching, cha-ching,

47:58.960 --> 48:01.800
all about the bubbling, bubbling.

48:01.800 --> 48:02.800
Yeah.

48:02.800 --> 48:03.800
Yeah.

48:03.800 --> 48:04.800
Yeah.

48:04.800 --> 48:13.520
I mean, hey, Linus Torvalds, the term, Linus Torvalds hate Fedora, gets people a lot more

48:13.520 --> 48:14.520
money.

48:14.520 --> 48:20.400
Then, Alan Saigo introduces some new piece of technology or something like that.

48:20.400 --> 48:21.400
Right.

48:21.400 --> 48:25.080
You, you know this better than anybody, both of you, because, you know, you're actively

48:25.080 --> 48:26.080
into this.

48:26.080 --> 48:27.080
Exactly.

48:27.080 --> 48:29.000
So, and it's all about the bottom line.

48:29.000 --> 48:33.520
See, if they don't do this, they get sold and they get, they shut down and they don't

48:33.520 --> 48:34.520
have any money.

48:34.520 --> 48:39.040
If they do do this, they're, they're rolling in dough and everything.

48:39.040 --> 48:40.040
Yeah, that's true.

48:40.040 --> 48:41.520
There's, there's, there's so many incentives.

48:41.520 --> 48:42.800
It keeps them in a holding pattern.

48:42.800 --> 48:46.560
I mean, cause I mean really the writing industry is just hurting as it is, but it does, it

48:46.560 --> 48:47.680
keeps them in a holding pattern.

48:47.680 --> 48:51.100
If they do get bought out, when they look at which writers to keep and which writers

48:51.100 --> 48:54.000
to fire, they will look at, they look at viewer counts.

48:54.000 --> 48:59.320
What are your thoughts, Matt, on like, you know, having to be, have a certain level of

48:59.320 --> 49:01.120
qualification before you're allowed to write?

49:01.120 --> 49:04.920
I mean, like not allowed, but like before, like, do you think there's a responsibility

49:04.920 --> 49:10.920
for some of these publication companies to like hire qualified writers?

49:10.920 --> 49:15.480
Or is it, if they, I would say just more of the, the, the, the knowledge of the topics

49:15.480 --> 49:16.480
themselves.

49:16.480 --> 49:20.360
The problem is, is there, they spend all their time and, and you know, there's a lot of,

49:20.360 --> 49:23.700
some of the sites you pointed out earlier are great examples of what happens when you

49:23.700 --> 49:25.440
hire the guy with the English degree.

49:25.440 --> 49:26.440
That's great.

49:26.440 --> 49:27.440
He's a fantastic writer.

49:27.440 --> 49:29.800
He didn't clue what he's talking about, but he writes very well.

49:29.800 --> 49:30.800
Yeah.

49:30.800 --> 49:34.200
And I, I don't know, maybe in an eighth or ninth grade level or whatever, put the point,

49:34.200 --> 49:35.200
but I know what I'm talking about.

49:35.200 --> 49:36.200
If you know the material, it's more important.

49:36.200 --> 49:38.480
If I know the material, I'm going to at least speak intelligently about it.

49:38.480 --> 49:39.480
So, you know.

49:39.480 --> 49:40.480
Yeah, that's true.

49:40.480 --> 49:41.480
That is true.

49:41.480 --> 49:42.480
Cause that's a whole nother problem.

49:42.480 --> 49:43.480
Yeah.

49:43.480 --> 49:44.480
Yeah.

49:44.480 --> 49:45.840
That's why I have an editor who has the English degree that can then take my mumble jumbo

49:45.840 --> 49:46.840
and make it into something legible.

49:46.840 --> 49:47.840
That's what I do.

49:47.840 --> 49:51.320
Can I get one of those for real life?

49:51.320 --> 49:52.560
Hey, I got, I got two.

49:52.560 --> 49:56.120
I have, my wife does initial edits and I have my final and then my final editor, but yeah,

49:56.120 --> 50:01.000
my wife just takes my stuff and she's just like, I don't even, she just cringes, she's

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
like, Oh God, here we go.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
So yeah.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
Good.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.000
She takes one for the team.

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
Oh, big time.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
I see it's kind of evolving into TV media.

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
It is.

50:08.000 --> 50:13.440
How all negative presses, all the hoopla, but no actually good miracle stories get coverage.

50:13.440 --> 50:14.440
Right.

50:14.440 --> 50:16.320
It's more American Idol and less Firefly.

50:16.320 --> 50:17.320
I mean, really.

50:17.320 --> 50:18.320
Yeah.

50:18.320 --> 50:19.320
Yeah.

50:19.320 --> 50:22.000
And you look at that email we got where the guy's like, gosh, it looks like the Linux

50:22.000 --> 50:23.920
community is a bunch of clown shoes.

50:23.920 --> 50:28.120
Yeah, see, it's, it's not a Linux thing.

50:28.120 --> 50:29.320
It's a, it's a human thing.

50:29.320 --> 50:30.380
It's a people thing.

50:30.380 --> 50:32.240
You see this in the gaming media.

50:32.240 --> 50:35.560
You see this in the technology media overall.

50:35.560 --> 50:40.400
You see this in, in regular media and yeah, this is a human thing.

50:40.400 --> 50:46.200
This is a phenomenon that is inherent to, I think media itself, not just Linux media.

50:46.200 --> 50:48.020
We are at the end of the day people.

50:48.020 --> 50:49.760
And so we want exciting stuff.

50:49.760 --> 50:58.520
We want short, sweet, exciting new stories, small content that can be easily consumed

50:58.520 --> 51:00.280
just and then we move on.

51:00.280 --> 51:04.480
And the thing is, is these sites recognize that and they manipulate us based on that.

51:04.480 --> 51:06.800
And so then they end up just producing shovelware.

51:06.800 --> 51:07.800
Exactly.

51:07.800 --> 51:08.800
Yeah, obviously.

51:08.800 --> 51:13.960
And see, it's not about the technical proficiency of the writer or the understanding that the

51:13.960 --> 51:17.040
actual journalist has about the topic.

51:17.040 --> 51:19.720
It's simply about what people want to hear.

51:19.720 --> 51:20.720
That's true.

51:20.720 --> 51:24.200
But the people that want to hear that generally tend to attract that class of writer though.

51:24.200 --> 51:28.080
They attract the one that can write or spin a really great tale but doesn't have a clue

51:28.080 --> 51:29.080
he's talking about.

51:29.080 --> 51:32.080
And of course then the market of course rewards that and that's the problem too.

51:32.080 --> 51:33.080
Yeah.

51:33.080 --> 51:38.120
Well, you know, Matt mentioned John C. Dvorak earlier and that guy can get away with writing

51:38.120 --> 51:41.240
just about anything strictly because of his name.

51:41.240 --> 51:43.280
He's a well-known writer.

51:43.280 --> 51:44.280
Everybody knows who he is.

51:44.280 --> 51:46.320
Well, there's also science behind what he does too.

51:46.320 --> 51:50.040
You know, he's very, very smart.

51:50.040 --> 51:51.040
Yeah.

51:51.040 --> 51:52.040
He knows exactly what he's doing.

51:52.040 --> 51:59.720
I think anyone that survives in that industry knows, like I feel like if I wanted to manipulate

51:59.720 --> 52:03.240
our audience all the time I could because I think I really know what they all like and

52:03.240 --> 52:07.200
I think I know how to, we could title things, we could cover certain things just strictly

52:07.200 --> 52:08.200
to manipulate.

52:08.200 --> 52:12.480
And it's like, you know what, actually I'll even say this, there's sometimes I have to

52:12.480 --> 52:17.120
fight the urge and every now and then you do see it leak out in our titles where we'll

52:17.120 --> 52:20.080
go for a little bit of an outrageous title just to get you to watch.

52:20.080 --> 52:25.040
Even though we hope that the actual show normalizes it, I've learned that it doesn't.

52:25.040 --> 52:29.860
That title sets the expectation when they go in, they then watch it through the filter

52:29.860 --> 52:34.120
that that title set and they perceive everything we say through that.

52:34.120 --> 52:37.800
So now I've kind of backed off from doing that, but you know, it can literally for some

52:37.800 --> 52:41.000
of these sites, it could be the difference in thousands of clicks.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.080
So it's a hard thing to fight.

52:43.080 --> 52:48.240
Also another thing is, some of these mainstream writers, they still think of Linux as just

52:48.240 --> 52:54.680
a toy, like something you just play around with, like they're talking down to it almost.

52:54.680 --> 52:58.480
A lot of them are and a lot of times you also have to follow where their sponsors are coming

52:58.480 --> 52:59.480
from.

52:59.480 --> 53:03.520
If it's an AdSense sponsor or some network sponsorship situation where it's just rotating

53:03.520 --> 53:06.900
ads, you know, usually they're just truly, honestly believing that it's a toy.

53:06.900 --> 53:11.560
But if it's actually a purchased in place ad, a lot of times on a lot of these sites,

53:11.560 --> 53:12.560
that's by design.

53:12.560 --> 53:16.120
There are a lot of them are mouthpieces for Microsoft and other places and I can think

53:16.120 --> 53:18.400
of a few of them right off the top of my head actually.

53:18.400 --> 53:19.400
PC World.

53:19.400 --> 53:20.400
Yeah, exactly.

53:20.400 --> 53:21.400
Yeah.

53:21.400 --> 53:22.400
Exactly.

53:22.400 --> 53:23.400
Oh, snaps.

53:23.400 --> 53:24.400
Well, yeah.

53:24.400 --> 53:25.400
Yeah.

53:25.400 --> 53:26.400
Yeah.

53:26.400 --> 53:27.400
Yeah.

53:27.400 --> 53:28.400
I thought, you know, we could name and shame, but there's just, you know, let's just say

53:28.400 --> 53:30.960
that if they're pretty popular, it's probably safe to say.

53:30.960 --> 53:31.960
Yeah.

53:31.960 --> 53:32.960
Yeah.

53:32.960 --> 53:35.560
You know, now we're naming shame and I'm watching the chairman and they're naming shame.

53:35.560 --> 53:36.560
That's cool.

53:36.560 --> 53:37.560
All right, guys.

53:37.560 --> 53:38.560
Well, any final thoughts?

53:38.560 --> 53:42.560
Riley, I thought I saw you, you piped up with something, but I was going to move on.

53:42.560 --> 53:43.560
Oh, yeah.

53:43.560 --> 53:44.560
That was great.

53:44.560 --> 53:45.560
Okay.

53:45.560 --> 53:46.560
No, I was just talking about that.

53:46.560 --> 53:47.560
Never mind.

53:47.560 --> 53:48.560
Okay.

53:48.560 --> 53:49.560
Keep going.

53:49.560 --> 53:50.560
Keep going.

53:50.560 --> 53:51.560
All right.

53:51.560 --> 53:52.560
Well, I'm going to read a couple of emails before we run.

53:52.560 --> 53:56.120
And then I think, Matt, I'll wrap us up with the RMS wrap, which debuted on Coder Radio

53:56.120 --> 53:57.120
this week.

53:57.120 --> 53:58.120
Nice.

53:58.120 --> 53:59.120
So this email comes in from Roy.

53:59.120 --> 54:01.200
He says, Hi, Chris and Matt.

54:01.200 --> 54:02.200
My name is Roy.

54:02.200 --> 54:03.200
Say it like Roy.

54:03.200 --> 54:06.440
Hi, Chris, I'm from Israel and I'm a product manager in a software company, a longtime

54:06.440 --> 54:09.200
fan of the show, and even longer fan of Ubuntu.

54:09.200 --> 54:14.480
I switched to Linux where Ubuntu during 7.04 was the first thing I tried out.

54:14.480 --> 54:18.040
I'm a longtime fan of Ubuntu as they were the ones that made me realize a user has the

54:18.040 --> 54:20.100
options other than Windows.

54:20.100 --> 54:21.220
And it was a wonderful experience.

54:21.220 --> 54:24.680
At first, when you moved away to Arch and preached others to do so.

54:24.680 --> 54:27.240
I don't know if I really preached that.

54:27.240 --> 54:28.240
Shared excitement preached.

54:28.240 --> 54:29.240
Thank you.

54:29.240 --> 54:30.240
Shared excitement.

54:30.240 --> 54:31.240
It just shared in my experience.

54:31.240 --> 54:36.080
It's kind of like, you know, when we start the Coke action show and I share my knowledge.

54:36.080 --> 54:37.080
Oh my goodness.

54:37.080 --> 54:38.080
Hello.

54:38.080 --> 54:39.080
It's the internet, baby.

54:39.080 --> 54:45.800
He said, I could not turn on Shuttleworth as we were talking about it, but I guess maybe

54:45.800 --> 54:48.040
it was the Amazon collaboration that got me.

54:48.040 --> 54:51.920
I like Amazon, but I don't like to get results from Amazon and everything that I search in

54:51.920 --> 54:52.920
the dash.

54:52.920 --> 54:57.100
Anyway, I switched to Arch and the first thing I have to say is, oh my God, system D. As

54:57.100 --> 55:01.480
a power user, Arch is easy to learn and the Arch Wiki is wonderful.

55:01.480 --> 55:04.040
Then I realized, or then I installed a desktop environment.

55:04.040 --> 55:08.460
You talk so much about KD, so I gave it a try, but I felt it was too broken for my needs.

55:08.460 --> 55:12.800
Certain features were missing or perhaps just weren't quite done.

55:12.800 --> 55:17.160
But he goes on to say that I switched to Gnome, which has been great.

55:17.160 --> 55:19.600
I guess you can say it's more complete than KD.

55:19.600 --> 55:23.800
It's okay, but whatever you do, never write about Gnome.

55:23.800 --> 55:24.800
Best advice I can ever give you.

55:24.800 --> 55:28.200
He says it does work and it even works smoothly.

55:28.200 --> 55:32.160
The only thing missing for me in Arch is a respectable GUI for Pac-Man as I want to explore

55:32.160 --> 55:38.320
the repo in a comfortable way and there are some ways to integrate with the AUR easily.

55:38.320 --> 55:41.120
I've installed your, but I would rather have something embedded with Pac-Man.

55:41.120 --> 55:42.120
Keep up the great work.

55:42.120 --> 55:46.720
Now, on Manjaro, they use a GUI package manager, correct?

55:46.720 --> 55:50.360
Yeah, they call it Pac-Mac or slap mat or something, I don't know what they call it.

55:50.360 --> 55:51.360
Oh, I have it on, yeah.

55:51.360 --> 55:52.360
Yeah, Pac-Mac, I think, like a M-A-C.

55:52.360 --> 55:53.360
Pac-Mac.

55:53.360 --> 55:54.360
No, it's Pac-Man XG, right?

55:54.360 --> 55:55.360
Isn't that what it is?

55:55.360 --> 55:56.360
No, no, no.

55:56.360 --> 55:57.360
Oh, Pac-Man.

55:57.360 --> 55:59.360
For the integrated thing, it's like it's P-A-C-M-A-C.

55:59.360 --> 56:00.360
It's Pac-Mac.

56:00.360 --> 56:02.600
Now, there is a GUI one called like Pac-Man XG, too, which is...

56:02.600 --> 56:05.000
Yeah, I actually run that for all my AUR stuff.

56:05.000 --> 56:10.400
Yeah, so there is even a Arch Wiki entry about it.

56:10.400 --> 56:14.360
And I also, for installing packages from the AUR, I'm sure I'll get some...

56:14.360 --> 56:17.760
Whenever you say what you use, by the way, on Arch, just so you know, just brace yourselves

56:17.760 --> 56:19.080
for this, Roy.

56:19.080 --> 56:22.220
Whenever you tell people what you use, you will get 30 people telling you not to ever

56:22.220 --> 56:23.920
use that, it will destroy Arch.

56:23.920 --> 56:26.520
So with that disclaimer made, I use Packer.

56:26.520 --> 56:28.040
Packer I like quite a bit.

56:28.040 --> 56:31.720
And then you can also, there's a web search for the Arch user repository.

56:31.720 --> 56:35.200
And what I really love about that is the comments and the votes.

56:35.200 --> 56:39.240
You can use that to kind of suss out if it's, you know, workable.

56:39.240 --> 56:40.240
That's right.

56:40.240 --> 56:43.080
Myself, I'm a huge fan of Pac-A-U-R.

56:43.080 --> 56:44.080
Okay.

56:44.080 --> 56:45.080
Yep.

56:45.080 --> 56:46.080
It's a really good one.

56:46.080 --> 56:49.440
It acts just like Pac-Man, but also works with the AUR.

56:49.440 --> 56:50.440
Yep, yep.

56:50.440 --> 56:53.280
And then you can just say like Pac-A-U-R dash S, capital S.

56:53.280 --> 56:56.880
And then the name of the package, and if it's in the, if it's in the actual Arch repo or

56:56.880 --> 56:57.880
in the AUR, it don't care.

56:57.880 --> 56:58.880
It just go gets it.

56:58.880 --> 56:59.880
Right.

56:59.880 --> 57:00.880
Exactly.

57:00.880 --> 57:01.880
It doesn't bump you a million times.

57:01.880 --> 57:02.880
Right.

57:02.880 --> 57:03.880
Yep.

57:03.880 --> 57:04.880
So.

57:04.880 --> 57:05.880
The GUI is definitely Pac-Man XG4.

57:05.880 --> 57:06.880
Okay.

57:06.880 --> 57:07.880
Oh, L4.

57:07.880 --> 57:08.880
The general one is Octopi.

57:08.880 --> 57:09.880
Okay.

57:09.880 --> 57:10.880
Okay.

57:10.880 --> 57:11.880
Octopi.

57:11.880 --> 57:12.880
Yeah.

57:12.880 --> 57:18.760
But the ones that I use are two awesome command line AUR interfaces that I've found, Pac-A-U-R

57:18.760 --> 57:19.760
and Packer.

57:19.760 --> 57:20.760
Yeah.

57:20.760 --> 57:21.760
Like a P-A-C-K-E-R.

57:21.760 --> 57:22.760
Yeah, I like Packer.

57:22.760 --> 57:23.760
They're awesome.

57:23.760 --> 57:24.760
Yeah.

57:24.760 --> 57:25.760
I've always just used Yowert.

57:25.760 --> 57:26.760
Yep.

57:26.760 --> 57:27.760
Yep.

57:27.760 --> 57:28.760
And I want to call it Yogurt.

57:28.760 --> 57:29.760
Yeah, I know.

57:29.760 --> 57:30.760
Or Yoplait or something.

57:30.760 --> 57:31.760
It used to be French.

57:31.760 --> 57:34.680
Like it used to be from the French Arch community.

57:34.680 --> 57:39.720
And it was only French and holy smokes, it used to be used back in the day.

57:39.720 --> 57:41.240
We should rename it Activia.

57:41.240 --> 57:45.160
I find that Yowert prompts me more than Packer does.

57:45.160 --> 57:47.000
Not by a lot, but just by a little bit.

57:47.000 --> 57:52.200
And I don't know, I just kind of like Packer output a little better, but Yowert's awesome

57:52.200 --> 57:53.200
too.

57:53.200 --> 57:55.080
In fact, usually that's how I install Packer is by installing Yowert.

57:55.080 --> 57:58.600
I have a request for the Linux community.

57:58.600 --> 58:03.320
If the Linux community could just start naming stuff I can pronounce, that would be so awesome.

58:03.320 --> 58:06.780
People were giving Nome a hard time for calling the music app music and the photos app photos

58:06.780 --> 58:10.760
and the file manager files, but now looking back at that, I'm thinking that makes some

58:10.760 --> 58:11.760
sense.

58:11.760 --> 58:13.360
Well, even KDE, they just slap a K in front of everything.

58:13.360 --> 58:14.360
I mean, I'm good with that.

58:14.360 --> 58:15.360
Yeah, that works.

58:15.360 --> 58:16.360
Yeah.

58:16.360 --> 58:19.520
And what they don't is like Dolphin and that's easy, you know?

58:19.520 --> 58:20.520
Yeah.

58:20.520 --> 58:22.640
The next email comes in from James on the Mir debate.

58:22.640 --> 58:26.280
He says, Hey guys, I just had one point to make, which has been overlooked in the discussion

58:26.280 --> 58:28.180
over Mir versus Wayland.

58:28.180 --> 58:33.000
You were discussing in a different context what quote unquote needed to happen, but I

58:33.000 --> 58:35.020
think Mir needed to happen.

58:35.020 --> 58:39.600
In 2010, Canonical was first to say they wanted to go with Wayland, but Wayland moved very

58:39.600 --> 58:43.200
slowly and was apparently not responsive to Canonical's needs.

58:43.200 --> 58:46.680
From Canonical's perspective, Mir needed to happen, perhaps.

58:46.680 --> 58:50.440
But surely it's obvious also that Mir gave Wayland a giant kick in the butt.

58:50.440 --> 58:54.440
I don't think Wayland would have made anything like the progress it is now without competition

58:54.440 --> 58:55.440
from Mir.

58:55.440 --> 58:58.640
See, now the Wayland guys really hate it when you say that, especially if you say it on

58:58.640 --> 58:59.640
a podcast.

58:59.640 --> 59:00.640
They really hate it.

59:00.640 --> 59:01.640
Yeah.

59:01.640 --> 59:04.800
I was the one, that's where the whole monkey suit thing came about is at that time.

59:04.800 --> 59:08.600
And I realized this has changed, but to my knowledge, and I'm going to disclose this,

59:08.600 --> 59:12.240
to my knowledge at that time, I saw no evidence of Wayland doing anything.

59:12.240 --> 59:13.240
Oh man.

59:13.240 --> 59:14.240
I'm totally with you, Matt.

59:14.240 --> 59:16.040
I just didn't see it.

59:16.040 --> 59:22.360
I had the clown show where we did like two or three years of our yearly Linux predictions

59:22.360 --> 59:26.520
where like, okay, Wayland's going to ship this year, and it never happened.

59:26.520 --> 59:32.880
Now what I think did happen is it focused the supporters of Wayland into doubling down

59:32.880 --> 59:34.920
on what was actually already there.

59:34.920 --> 59:39.920
And Intel got more involved and started a dialogue with Red Hat, and they started working

59:39.920 --> 59:43.800
closer together to push Wayland forward.

59:43.800 --> 59:46.120
Server manufacturers started thinking about it a little more.

59:46.120 --> 59:51.880
So I think even if the core amount of contributors maybe to Wayland hasn't gone up, or if it

59:51.880 --> 59:55.600
has, I don't know, but I definitely think it's moved things forward.

59:55.600 --> 01:00:00.400
And we just had a great, thanks to Heaven's Revenge in the mumble room, a great pre-show

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:04.120
technical chat about the differences between Wayland and Mir.

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:11.200
And it actually, I should get him to try to post it somewhere, but the summary was there's

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:13.800
also some long-term architectural differences they're making.

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:18.960
So we could see this conversation, I think a lot of us are kind of just expecting it

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:20.720
to ship and then we're going to stop talking about it.

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:24.000
But I actually think once it ships, that's when the conversation's actually going to

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000
begin.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:30.720
We're going to look back at this pre-launch time stuff as like adorable because in a couple

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:33.240
of years we're going to be living it, right?

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:34.240
Or a year?

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:35.240
I don't know.

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:36.240
He says, he backs it up there.

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:38.880
He says, five years of Wayland development show that open source software development

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:40.920
needs competition.

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:44.960
We're provided that and Wayland has a lot more progress as a result.

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:48.040
I'd say bring on X.12 too, why not?

01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:49.040
James?

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:50.040
All right.

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:51.040
Yeah, man.

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.040
Who needs X.11 when you can have X.12?

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.040
There is a thing.

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:54.040
There is a thing.

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:55.040
All right, Matt.

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:56.040
Well, I think I'm going to wrap us here.

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:57.040
What do you think?

01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:58.280
Anything else you want to cover before we wrap up?

01:00:58.280 --> 01:00:59.280
I think that's it.

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:02.440
The one thing I would leave on, well, as far as Wayland's concerned, I'd want to leave

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:06.240
everybody with this statement is that when I made that statement initially, I was instantly

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:10.360
given 101 reasons why, well, no, Wayland's developing just fine and it doesn't need to

01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:11.920
speed up and da, da, da, da, da, da.

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:17.040
It's interesting that that happened and, of course, now, of course, with the whole Mirror

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:20.960
thing happening, Wayland is, in fact, going really quickly and it's doing amazing things

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:22.400
and it's coming along very nicely.

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:29.360
Well, and I think what I want the meta message of this episode to be is the dialogue in the

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:34.040
open source community actually does matter because that's what encourages people to join

01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:35.120
open source projects.

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:36.120
That's what motivates people.

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:37.840
It gives people passion.

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:41.880
That's why the news coverage and the media around Linux is actually more important than

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:46.400
it is around these commercial companies that have dictators and commands from above, right?

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:51.280
There's actually a larger impact Linux media can have and in that same regard, there's

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:55.160
a larger impact that competition has because it galvanizes each camp.

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:56.160
It gets people focused.

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:57.160
It gets people working.

01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:01.720
It gets people behind their effort and it pushes things forward and just like commercial

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:06.220
competition helps commercial products, open source competition helps open source products

01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:11.240
and yes, I think both Matt and I acknowledge there is plenty of opportunity for display

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:12.760
server fragmentation, right?

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:13.760
Oh, totally.

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:14.760
Yeah.

01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:18.320
We could be going down an uncharted path and forfeiting one of the cornerstones of Linux

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:24.520
stability thanks to X11 that we've had for years, but in the end, we might also see ourselves

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:29.160
evolving into something that's pretty awesome and with two folks going at it like this,

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:31.200
now we've got our Coke and Pepsi of display servers.

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:34.320
They're going to be pushing each other forward, I hope, at least for a while, at least for

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:35.320
quite a while.

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:36.320
All right, Matt.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:40.280
Well, so I want to give people a little heads up if they've stayed tuned this long.

01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:44.360
This week on the Linux Action Show, Matt and I will be reviewing Cinnamon 2.0.

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:49.440
Actually, I guess it's technically next week, but Cinnamon 2.0 has been out for a little

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:54.960
while and I've got it installed in a VM and I've also got it installed on my Benobes and

01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:56.680
I think we'll give you our full take on it.

01:02:56.680 --> 01:03:00.640
I know there's a lot of folks out there who aren't quite happy with any particular desktop

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:02.240
and some of them are looking towards Cinnamon.

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:05.280
I know we have some Mint 14 users in our Mumble Room right now.

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:09.560
They're looking towards the next release of Mint with Cinnamon 2.0 and hoping that it's

01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:10.760
going in the right direction.

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:14.600
So we'll give you our thoughts on the new version of Cinnamon in the next episode of

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:15.600
the Linux Action Show.

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:16.600
Good stuff.

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:17.600
All right.

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:19.720
Well, I'm going to end us with the RMS rap.

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:22.000
So this was cut from this week's Koda Radio.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.440
It was put to the end of Koda Radio because during the show, about midway through the

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:32.440
show, we had a Skype hiccup and something happened and Mike dropped off and you hear

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:35.080
me trying to reconnect to him throughout the song.

01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:39.400
And so I decided to kill time by taking a song I like from Ronald Janke's called Side

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:45.380
Tracked and pairing it with Richard Stallman, which is two great things that go well together.

01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:46.880
It's like peanut butter and chocolate, man.

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:48.140
So here you go.

01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:53.240
This is a clip from the end of this week's Koda Radio and we'll end with this.

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:54.240
Thanks for joining us, everybody.

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:55.240
We'll see you right back here next week.

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:57.040
Don't forget, you can email us.

be part of the dialogue.

01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:17.360
We are your internet lug.

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:21.160
So just come and hang out with us and enjoy the RMS rap.

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:22.160
See you next Sunday, Matt.

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:23.160
See you then.

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:24.160
There's nobody else here, Chris.

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:25.160
You don't hear me?

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:26.160
What are you talking about?

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:27.160
Christopher.

01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:28.160
Oh, I hear you.

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:35.600
You don't hear my wonderful beam or what about that?

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:36.600
He's a jackass.

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:37.600
Do you hear that?

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:38.600
Or do you hear?

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:39.600
I think it's wasted effort.

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:40.600
Or do you hear?

01:04:40.600 --> 01:05:04.680
I think we should all make those businesses fail.

01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:17.320
It's the Stallman rap, here it comes, here it comes.

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:26.800
And the value of this is negative, and the value of this is negative, it's negative in

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:27.800
the freedom dimension.

01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:28.800
I think it's wasted effort.

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:29.800
Get it out of here.

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:30.800
And the value of this is negative.

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:37.920
I think that we should all make those businesses fail.

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:40.920
Get it out of here.

01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:49.640
It's negative in the freedom dimension.

01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:55.720
It's negative in the freedom dimension.

01:05:55.720 --> 01:06:01.180
Get it out of here.

01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:05.120
Get it out of here.

01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:11.120
And the value of this is negative.

01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:16.120
It's negative in the freedom dimension.

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:21.120
And the value of this is negative.

01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:22.120
Get it out of here.

01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:23.120
I think it's wasted effort.

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:24.120
I think that we should all make those businesses fail.

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:25.120
Get it out of here.

01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:27.520
The value of this is negative.

01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:29.020
Get it out of here.

01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:37.880
He is a jackass.

01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:40.980
He is a jackass.

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:45.020
He is a jackass.

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:47.340
Hello, everybody.

01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:49.920
Get it out of here.

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:53.120
Get it out of here.

01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:57.120
I think that we should all make those businesses fail.

01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:59.720
And the value of this is negative.

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:02.120
And the value of this is negative.

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:04.720
Negative in the freedom dimension.

01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:15.920
And the value of this is negative.

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:17.320
I think it's wasted effort.

01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:19.020
And the value of this is negative.

01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:20.520
I think it's wasted effort.

01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:25.120
I think that we should all make those businesses fail.

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:29.220
It's negative in the freedom dimension.

01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:32.420
It's negative in the freedom dimension.

01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:34.020
I think it's wasted effort.

01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:41.120
Hello, everybody.

01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:47.120
Hello, everybody.
