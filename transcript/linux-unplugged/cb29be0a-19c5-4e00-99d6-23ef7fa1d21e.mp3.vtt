00:00.000 --> 00:08.180
have you seen mario 35 have you seen this no so the it's a switch game that

00:08.180 --> 00:13.200
takes like the the original mario game and then versus 35 other players and as

00:13.200 --> 00:16.260
they like kill Koopas and stuff like that or goombas whatever there they've

00:16.260 --> 00:21.360
come to your screen and sort of a last-man-standing kind of game fun it's

00:21.360 --> 00:26.600
an overlay on top of a mario super mario bros emulator it's it's really kind of

00:26.600 --> 00:31.360
fun like it is you know and you know what they can just give me over and over

00:31.360 --> 00:36.200
and over again with mario I tell you what that's classic

00:43.400 --> 00:48.920
hello friends and welcome to episode 375 of your weekly Linux talk show my name

00:48.920 --> 00:52.400
is Chris my name is Wes hello Wes this episode is brought to you by a cloud

00:52.400 --> 00:56.880
guru so many career possibilities in the cloud so little time ACG's learning

00:56.880 --> 01:01.560
paths help you take the right courses to prepare for architect developer security

01:01.560 --> 01:05.320
and many other high-paying cloud jobs get hired get certified get learning a

01:05.320 --> 01:12.520
cloud guru calm mr. Payne 375 is packed with lots of good community news and

01:12.520 --> 01:16.440
then once we get through all of that we're gonna try something new it's an

01:16.440 --> 01:22.280
idea that I'm kind of stealing from another tech podcast accidentally if you

01:22.280 --> 01:27.200
will and it's the idea of an exit interview so we're gonna do an exit

01:27.200 --> 01:31.960
interview with Papa Wes today I've been running it for a few weeks on a Dell

01:31.960 --> 01:36.640
precision test laptop and I wanted to try different distros and at one point

01:36.640 --> 01:42.080
it crossed my silly little head that it'd be fun to run Papa Wes on a Dell

01:42.080 --> 01:47.280
laptop and then I found myself sticking with it for a bit so I've been using and

01:47.280 --> 01:50.720
last night I sat down with Wes and I said Wes I gotta I gotta confess

01:50.720 --> 01:54.800
something and it was kind of embarrassing if you know my history

01:54.800 --> 01:57.960
with Papa Wes so I I brought Wes over so I didn't want anybody to find out I

01:57.960 --> 02:00.720
said Wes come here come here and then we got in the cone of silence the cone of

02:00.720 --> 02:10.320
silence and I think Wes I think I after using Papa Wes have discovered

02:10.320 --> 02:14.360
something that makes it stand out and different than any other Linux

02:14.360 --> 02:17.800
distribution so big claim I'm gonna try to prove it later in the episode but

02:17.800 --> 02:20.440
don't tell anybody okay I don't want that I don't want anybody little secret

02:20.440 --> 02:24.400
okay all right well now they're out of the

02:24.400 --> 02:27.000
colon let's bring in the mobile room time appropriate greetings mumble room

02:27.000 --> 02:39.760
hello hello that was a good one that was a really good one well let's talk

02:39.760 --> 02:46.040
about some news there's a brand new fancy plasma plasma 5.20 is out and it

02:46.040 --> 02:49.720
is an absolutely massive release running it right here on the machine I'm reading

02:49.720 --> 02:55.080
this new story about and it's one of these releases where everyday things

02:55.080 --> 02:59.000
have gotten better like the little utilities you use the task manager

02:59.000 --> 03:02.880
notification system settings it's just gotten some nice improvements and been

03:02.880 --> 03:06.820
overhauled just to make it more useful and usable and you can really say that

03:06.820 --> 03:10.520
about all of plasma from the way on-screen displays are handled some new

03:10.520 --> 03:14.960
tricks that Kaywin has and for me I'm always super appreciative of

03:14.960 --> 03:21.000
improvements to the way notifications work and there's a lot of changes on the

03:21.000 --> 03:25.040
notification system in plasma 520 for one you now get notified when your

03:25.040 --> 03:28.120
system is about to run out of space even if your home director is like on a

03:28.120 --> 03:31.920
different partition yeah that's really yeah there's just a lot of little things

03:31.920 --> 03:35.880
in there about like you can make certain things sticky now and in there it's

03:35.880 --> 03:40.520
continued to get a lot of improvement and I think plasma remains out of every

03:40.520 --> 03:44.440
desktop environment not just Linux desktop environments but in in the world

03:44.440 --> 03:47.960
I think it's got some of the best some of the best notifications management now

03:47.960 --> 03:50.640
oh yeah it really does it's just full featured they've clearly thought about

03:50.640 --> 03:54.720
it they've iterated over a few releases now so it feels kind of polished yeah

03:54.720 --> 03:59.160
it's really solid and I'm on neon right here so I just went ahead and did the

03:59.160 --> 04:03.320
old update and was kind of prepared for things to go sideways since it is such a

04:03.320 --> 04:08.600
huge update but seems like everything's nice there is a change they've made and

04:08.600 --> 04:12.080
the way plasma works that if you've already modified the default and you

04:12.080 --> 04:15.560
upgrade it won't it won't leaves it there yeah it won't change it but if

04:15.560 --> 04:18.240
you're installing it fresh there's a pretty big change to the way the task

04:18.240 --> 04:21.640
manager works now yeah there's lots of improvements over in the task manager

04:21.640 --> 04:26.040
world I mean they did change the looks to its icon only by default yeah but

04:26.040 --> 04:30.120
there's also big changes in how it behaves when you open several windows

04:30.120 --> 04:33.440
with the same application like maybe you might do if you're opening a bunch of

04:33.440 --> 04:38.720
libre office documents say a task manager will group them together clicking

04:38.720 --> 04:41.600
on the grouped windows will cycle through them bringing each to the

04:41.600 --> 04:44.900
forefront until you reach the document you want and yeah that's kind of a

04:44.900 --> 04:49.040
different way to do it but I'll give it a try yeah I'm not a big fan of grouping

04:49.040 --> 04:52.480
it together you know one of the things I kind of do on a plasma desktop is I

04:52.480 --> 04:58.280
really often all I'll just keep the task manager on the bottom and I know it's

04:58.280 --> 05:00.840
hip today to put it on the right side of your screen or the left side of your

05:00.840 --> 05:05.240
screen because you know you got more vertical or whatever but I like the long

05:05.240 --> 05:08.240
taskbar and I feel like if I got a long widescreen monitor I might as well

05:08.240 --> 05:11.480
stretch that task manager I'm doing anything for you there I don't need it

05:11.480 --> 05:15.240
I like having all the windows a square pop pop pop pop I'm more of an alt tab

05:15.240 --> 05:20.360
kind of guy anyways though so not really gonna impact me really kind of kind of

05:20.360 --> 05:23.000
one of these releases where you know maybe you're gonna base a distro like

05:23.000 --> 05:26.120
kaboom to off of a future version of one of those would be a really good one

05:26.120 --> 05:30.280
because there's also some really good Wayland of improvements that have landed

05:30.280 --> 05:35.080
you know back in 2019 the KTE community decided to set off as an official goal

05:35.080 --> 05:39.760
to prioritize building for Wayland essentially and I think the efforts

05:39.760 --> 05:43.560
really starting to pay off big there's lots of features that have landed now

05:43.560 --> 05:47.680
the clipper clipboard utility and the middle click paste stuff are now fully

05:47.680 --> 05:51.920
functional in Wayland love me middle click copy and paste and the

05:51.920 --> 05:56.080
multi-purpose launcher calculator search K runner app that's part of like my

05:56.080 --> 06:00.280
favorite thing of plasma yeah will stay in the correct places and works in the

06:00.280 --> 06:03.840
right place on Wayland it just behaves a lot better mouse and touchpad support

06:03.840 --> 06:07.960
are nearly on par now with the X counterparts and screencasting is now

06:07.960 --> 06:12.640
supported and Wayland on plasma 520 it's awesome task manager got better over

06:12.640 --> 06:16.780
there too it's got window thumbnails and really in general the whole desktop is

06:16.780 --> 06:20.280
more stable and and you'll like this Chris and no longer crashes when X

06:20.280 --> 06:25.440
Wayland us that is an improvement in it yeah and this so the task managers

06:25.440 --> 06:29.880
showing thumbnails we know that really tells us is that they've come up with a

06:29.880 --> 06:34.400
way now for one Wayland component could to get information from another

06:34.400 --> 06:38.400
application that one of the big things that's been the problem here is that one

06:38.400 --> 06:41.200
Wayland application couldn't necessarily read the other at contents of the other

06:41.200 --> 06:44.860
application you know take a little tiny screenshot and show it to you it's a

06:44.860 --> 06:48.000
good time to be a plasma user well really it's a good time to be a desktop

06:48.000 --> 06:52.880
Linux user because our desktops are really dialing this stuff in now I got a

06:52.880 --> 06:56.000
couple of just nice quality of life improvements when I went to 520 I had

06:56.000 --> 07:00.780
some icon rendering issues in my system tray area some icons were essentially

07:00.780 --> 07:05.520
overlapping each other fix now you know it's funny when I go to other platforms

07:05.520 --> 07:08.080
we don't normally mention on this show there's other platforms you know

07:08.080 --> 07:11.960
especially with like you know max got a terminal Windows W cell to the Linux

07:11.960 --> 07:15.560
story is way better there now I think I'm finding I miss the most honestly

07:15.560 --> 07:18.600
sometimes it's just the desktop because our desktops are so good we've got all

07:18.600 --> 07:22.360
the different kinds you could want and often they're very configurable yeah and

07:22.360 --> 07:25.800
the we're getting to the point where these releases are really just

07:25.800 --> 07:30.060
whittling off some of the niggly kind of not quite right or needed another go

07:30.060 --> 07:34.200
kind of stuff or or they're positioning us for future technologies we're getting

07:34.200 --> 07:37.240
both of that kind at the same time it's a good we're in a good maturity cycle

07:37.240 --> 07:42.840
for these desktops amen and 520 of plasma looks like a really really good

07:42.840 --> 07:46.740
one I'm actually really grateful of for all of the hard work the team does over

07:46.740 --> 07:50.800
there because it just has been such a consistent performer recently of course

07:50.800 --> 07:55.560
everybody's freaking out this week because NFS after being around for a

07:55.560 --> 07:59.280
hundred years got extended attribute support so Colonel five nine baby we're

07:59.280 --> 08:03.200
gonna have ourselves a little party but yeah otherwise five nine release came

08:03.200 --> 08:07.600
out recently and looks to be a pretty good release but that got overshadowed

08:07.600 --> 08:13.420
by another announcement then I don't know how many people have caught and I

08:13.420 --> 08:18.480
think this could be huge VMware has announced VMware's you they have like

08:18.480 --> 08:22.080
this fling have you seen this where VMware fling have you heard of this no

08:22.080 --> 08:27.000
what is a fling okay yeah so I didn't know either so I'm glad I'm having one

08:27.000 --> 08:33.120
I know right so a fling is a VMware program sponsored through the office of

08:33.120 --> 08:37.560
the CTO at VMware designed to offer early-stage software to the VMware

08:37.560 --> 08:41.920
community it's not generally available it's not necessarily production code

08:41.920 --> 08:46.000
it's not even necessarily gonna be a product but it's something that you could

08:46.000 --> 08:48.400
submit bugs against you know it's something they have an old kind of an

08:48.400 --> 08:51.680
opener process so they're just having a fling not guaranteeing and stays around

08:51.680 --> 08:54.920
or goes anywhere but yeah testing this stuff out letting users play with it and

08:54.920 --> 09:01.560
now their latest fling is with ARM hardware and while they announced

09:01.560 --> 09:06.760
support for a bunch of different ARM platforms the most notable is that

09:06.760 --> 09:13.720
VMware ESXi is now available on the Raspberry Pi you can run VMware ESXi on

09:13.720 --> 09:19.640
a Raspberry Pi now that's only the 4b mind you but still that's interesting I

09:19.640 --> 09:23.480
happen to know someone you might be familiar with who has a lot of Raspberry

09:23.480 --> 09:28.320
Pies and has a lot of workloads on them yeah funny because the number one thing

09:28.320 --> 09:32.760
that I kind of don't like about my Raspberry Pi empire of servers is that

09:32.760 --> 09:36.040
it's all on the metal I don't have it virtualized if I was gonna have one

09:36.040 --> 09:40.600
layer of protection and redundancy and you know all of that it would be to have

09:40.600 --> 09:44.920
everything running in a VM that I could snapshot or that I could move around and

09:44.920 --> 09:47.760
I just didn't know if it was possible in the Raspberry Pi I played with KVM and

09:47.760 --> 09:51.600
boy was that was that a rough rough rough experience I'll be curious to have

09:51.600 --> 09:55.360
this does you know if it's any better maybe give KVM a shot again to compare

09:55.360 --> 10:00.840
ESXi does have a lot of nice interfaces APIs just a familiar world for people

10:00.840 --> 10:04.640
already familiar with that from you know from the server space they do recommend

10:04.640 --> 10:08.760
you go with the 8 gig model if you can though just to get more features of v

10:08.760 --> 10:12.760
sphere which I happen to have one right here so I think I'll be doing that I

10:12.760 --> 10:16.600
don't think this is something people are gonna really use in production I think

10:16.600 --> 10:21.280
it's more of experimentation it's about learning so this is a problem that

10:21.280 --> 10:26.200
VMware had and this solves this problem pretty easily in the past if somebody

10:26.200 --> 10:31.040
wanted to learn VMware you kind of had to tell them to go buy a $5,000 server

10:31.040 --> 10:34.280
to go learn how to do this right I mean yeah you had to have stuff to run it you

10:34.280 --> 10:36.800
had to actually have access to the software you had to build up yeah you

10:36.800 --> 10:39.920
had a lot yeah even if you had a demo you know it would last for 30 days and

10:39.920 --> 10:42.960
you got a license it you got to run it on a machine that's I didn't tell

10:42.960 --> 10:45.880
processor with a certain base minimum set of features you got to have some

10:45.880 --> 10:49.120
storage there's some minimum really designed around those you know yeah

10:49.120 --> 10:53.960
data center work work cases and it is very popular in the data center so this

10:53.960 --> 10:57.920
now solves that problem because now you can say we'll go buy this $75 raspberry

10:57.920 --> 11:01.160
pie you can learn some of the fundamentals about the interface you can

11:01.160 --> 11:04.720
learn our language you can learn how to build these systems yeah it's just one

11:04.720 --> 11:07.120
more thing that the pie is good at if you're trying to learn and set up things

11:07.120 --> 11:12.720
to play with all this technology huge but also also think about this from a

11:12.720 --> 11:18.600
data recovery standpoint so if you have a VMware server that has a big old set

11:18.600 --> 11:22.920
of VMware fsd you know you maybe got a big VMware fs device something like

11:22.920 --> 11:27.400
that and the host computer dies the only way you're gonna get access to that is

11:27.400 --> 11:32.440
to buy another $5,000 server install VMware and then mount the disk now you

11:32.440 --> 11:38.620
can buy a $75 pie and mount that same VMFS device and get access to that one

11:38.620 --> 11:42.540
or two three or four files that you needed to recover with essentially a

11:42.540 --> 11:46.760
Raspberry Pi acting as a data recovery node but additionally these stupid

11:46.760 --> 11:51.200
things I believe are gonna support vMotion which is the live migration of a

11:51.200 --> 11:55.040
VM host very cool so you could live migrate a host to a pie and then

11:55.040 --> 11:59.720
migrate it off again and you could do it with load rules right so you could say

11:59.720 --> 12:05.760
the VM runs on this pie until the load gets to a certain requirement once we

12:05.760 --> 12:09.920
have a certain amount of processing and memory requirements or CPU requirements

12:09.920 --> 12:12.920
or disk or whatever it is whatever the rules I haven't used in a long time

12:12.920 --> 12:18.140
automatically migrate that workload over to a powerful x86 server and then

12:18.140 --> 12:23.080
really burn you know burn the coal and and address that load and then after it

12:23.080 --> 12:26.320
settles down migrate back to the pie I can tell you're already gonna abuse

12:26.320 --> 12:30.300
it is interesting you know they say this evaluation program is for the

12:30.300 --> 12:33.000
enterprise architects who are considering the viability of virtualizing

12:33.000 --> 12:36.240
ARM workloads so there's also this sort of you know get people who are used to

12:36.240 --> 12:41.160
running it just on Intel machines yeah all right this can work on ARM too yeah

12:41.160 --> 12:45.360
and I think it's mostly gonna be for testing mm-hmm mostly for people that

12:45.360 --> 12:50.880
are already VMware shops already familiar with it mm-hmm and the Zen

12:50.880 --> 12:55.280
project recently announced that they're also working on virtualization on the

12:55.280 --> 12:59.720
Raspberry Pi and other ARM CPUs and in fact to get Zen working we'd covered a

12:59.720 --> 13:02.880
story recently where they had to solve some really particular problems and so

13:02.880 --> 13:07.540
people are in multiple groups actually are taking virtualization on the

13:07.540 --> 13:11.440
Raspberry Pi really seriously and I say good on them because look where this

13:11.440 --> 13:15.700
thing's gone and where's it gonna go in another five years and I'm sure it's

13:15.700 --> 13:19.840
gonna just be even more powerful more into more places it's eating the world I

13:19.840 --> 13:23.080
think you and I should give it a go you know we got some other things coming up

13:23.080 --> 13:26.280
for the next couple of weeks but in a bit we should give it a go I checked in

13:26.280 --> 13:30.680
on it people already submitting bugs great stuffs already getting fixed so it

13:30.680 --> 13:36.560
seems to be a pretty active project out of the gate already and I think I think

13:36.560 --> 13:39.480
they're onto something here I think they're onto something so anyways we'll

13:39.480 --> 13:43.120
have a link to it if you want to download the ISO in the show notes you

13:43.120 --> 13:46.920
can try the fling version without a license it's free for anyone to use I

13:46.920 --> 13:49.040
don't think you're supposed to use in production I don't know if has any other

13:49.040 --> 13:52.760
limitations I'm not very familiar with the with the program but you or I or

13:52.760 --> 13:55.840
whatever whoever that doesn't even have a license can go download this and try

13:55.840 --> 13:59.280
it so if you do if you try it out there go to Linux unplug calm slash contact

13:59.280 --> 14:02.720
let us know how it goes tell us how it goes it's just a great I mean you know

14:02.720 --> 14:06.080
like four years ago I would never have thought that this would happen but you

14:06.080 --> 14:09.760
would ever take the Raspberry Pi this seriously right yeah yeah you know

14:09.760 --> 14:12.440
you're gonna be limited right and how much the pie is gonna be able to run

14:12.440 --> 14:16.240
you're gonna be really limited and I guess and you're gonna end up with just

14:16.240 --> 14:19.600
arm virtual machines so you might not be able to unless you could virtualize arm

14:19.600 --> 14:22.200
on the exit you still need stuff that runs on your architecture you still need

14:22.200 --> 14:26.160
yeah yeah exactly so I don't think I don't think it's gonna emulate x86 right

14:26.160 --> 14:30.360
but if you could run it on a on a Raspberry Pi you're probably building it

14:30.360 --> 14:33.320
I would imagine for a much larger production arm server like they do

14:33.320 --> 14:37.600
support a set of arm servers and that's probably where you'd see that workload

14:37.600 --> 14:41.080
kind of making sense is you build it on a pie in your office or something like

14:41.080 --> 14:44.960
that and then you deploy it on a like an Amazon arm box or something like that

14:44.960 --> 14:49.320
you've got some sort of edge devices out there which I wonder if I wonder if that

14:49.320 --> 14:53.440
won't be a use case for the Apple Mac arm machines if people might be buying

14:53.440 --> 14:56.760
those for arm development for the arm in the cloud it's a whole new world it's a

14:56.760 --> 14:59.840
whole new world Wes it's a whole new world we'll give it a go we'll report

14:59.840 --> 15:02.320
back I don't think there's much we don't really have much to say on it other than

15:02.320 --> 15:06.200
that because it's still new and we haven't tried it yet so when we try it

15:06.200 --> 15:09.240
and we have formed I think an educated opinion on it we'll do an episode

15:09.240 --> 15:14.380
dedicated to it maybe see how it stacks up sound good yeah virtualization on the

15:14.380 --> 15:17.960
pie take two congratulations to the folks at VMware though I know they've

15:17.960 --> 15:20.960
been working on this for a couple of years they teased it a little while ago

15:20.960 --> 15:26.240
and it took a ton of R&D you gotta hope and figure they're doing the math that

15:26.240 --> 15:30.040
this is gonna turn to something big if they put all this effort into it

15:30.040 --> 15:36.000
Linode.com slash unplugged go there to get a $100 60-day credit for a new

15:36.000 --> 15:40.560
account that's awesome Linode started in 2003 is one of the first companies in

15:40.560 --> 15:45.000
cloud computing three years before AWS and now they remain as one of the

15:45.000 --> 15:50.280
largest independent cloud computing companies in the world and you know

15:50.280 --> 15:53.280
what's something that we haven't mentioned on this show before is Linode

15:53.280 --> 15:58.200
has been a longtime supporter and sponsor of our beloved Linux fest

15:58.200 --> 16:01.720
Northwest sure has I mean I can't count the number of conferences I've seen them

16:01.720 --> 16:05.600
with their you know green booth set up I know and actually there's been a lot of

16:05.600 --> 16:09.320
times when maybe we had a different sponsor on here that wide walk by their

16:09.320 --> 16:17.720
booth longingly when we sold JB and I wanted to keep things separate from what

16:17.720 --> 16:20.600
was JB infrastructure what was my personal infrastructure that was my

16:20.600 --> 16:24.720
excuse to go check out Linode that's when I was like let's go see what Linode

16:24.720 --> 16:28.440
has to offer and been using them since then so that's about two years ago a

16:28.440 --> 16:32.960
little more than two years ago and I've watched them really respond to a very

16:32.960 --> 16:37.040
fast market so you'd think a company's been around like three years before AWS

16:37.040 --> 16:41.160
got started would be slow to adapt but that is not the case at all like they're

16:41.160 --> 16:44.160
clearly following this stuff they're just always modernizing their

16:44.160 --> 16:48.520
infrastructure they started using user mode Linux and you know one data center

16:48.520 --> 16:52.280
and now they've totally modernized the infrastructure they have 11 data centers

16:52.280 --> 16:56.720
worldwide they have a cloud manager that's super easy to use Wes was just

16:56.720 --> 17:00.440
looking at their GPU compute options I think you said you saw a machine that

17:00.440 --> 17:04.200
you could have up to four dedicated GPUs oh yeah so they got everything from like

17:04.200 --> 17:09.840
a $5 a month rig up to like four GPU rig and for the most part when we're

17:09.840 --> 17:13.160
building a system these days we've been doing the dedicated CPU rigs didn't we

17:13.160 --> 17:16.640
do a dedicated CPU rig for the matrix server yeah we did just in that way it

17:16.640 --> 17:20.920
kind of has the performance we need and it's really nice because everything's

17:20.920 --> 17:26.040
backed by native SSD storage 40 gigabit connections and they're super crazy fast

17:26.040 --> 17:31.420
really the great thing about Linode is you can do the math like this if it

17:31.420 --> 17:36.840
runs on Linux it runs on Linode that's really just it I mean they they started

17:36.840 --> 17:39.920
this whole thing with a love for Linux to begin with so they've always been a

17:39.920 --> 17:43.840
fan of giving you access to everything you want every plan comes with their

17:43.840 --> 17:49.400
amazing human-powered customer support 24 7 365 and you know not just Linux

17:49.400 --> 17:53.680
Fest Northwest they're also a sponsor of the Kubuntu project which is a

17:53.680 --> 17:57.800
favorite here on the show and that's just really great to see that too so you

17:57.800 --> 18:02.000
can support the show you can get a $100 60-day credit and you can spend

18:02.000 --> 18:05.640
something up on the node that matches your needs you start by going to Linode

18:05.640 --> 18:09.620
calm slash unplugged that's the URL that tells them yep I heard about it here on

18:09.620 --> 18:13.320
unplugged and that's the one that unlocks the $100 60-day credit for a

18:13.320 --> 18:18.480
new account they have a 99% uptime they have a really easy to use DNS manager

18:18.480 --> 18:21.200
that allows you to easily switch your domains to your host that are running on

18:21.200 --> 18:25.320
the note something we've had to do a couple of times indeed it's really

18:25.320 --> 18:27.720
pretty simple and straightforward though so don't worry about it you'll be able

18:27.720 --> 18:30.560
to handle it and if you want to use Linode to learn they've got a lot of

18:30.560 --> 18:33.300
great options for that but if you just want to get something started you can do

18:33.300 --> 18:36.760
a one-click deployment and get going they provide virtual servers that make

18:36.760 --> 18:40.080
it easy and affordable for you to host anything in the cloud so check them out

18:40.080 --> 18:44.000
Linode calm slash unplugged thanks to Linode for sponsoring this show and

18:44.000 --> 18:48.840
thanks to everybody who supports this show by visiting Linode calm slash unplugged

18:48.840 --> 18:55.720
and getting that $100 60-day credit on your new account a little more community

18:55.720 --> 18:59.640
news I think this is pretty great there's a project that we followed on

18:59.640 --> 19:04.600
the show before called nebula which if you recall is a software-based overlay

19:04.600 --> 19:09.280
that Wes and I just went bonkers over it's really simple to operate it's

19:09.280 --> 19:13.280
resilient to devices coming and going it's a software-defined network like the

19:13.280 --> 19:17.240
one you've always wanted lightweight modern crypto straightforward to use

19:17.240 --> 19:20.760
and it just focuses on letting you build the network you want completely

19:20.760 --> 19:23.920
independent of where your devices are so they could be across multiple providers

19:23.920 --> 19:28.920
slack uses this to just essentially bridge different public cloud providers

19:28.920 --> 19:32.600
and to create one flat network yeah that's how they connect their

19:32.600 --> 19:35.600
production infrastructure we've talked about it before here on the show yes

19:35.600 --> 19:39.880
episode 329 network truth there's go check that out if you want more info if

19:39.880 --> 19:43.720
you missed it and we had a chance there to talk to one of the founding

19:43.720 --> 19:46.800
developers about it and do the gushing that we did because we loved the

19:46.800 --> 19:53.200
project so much and now it appears not only do they have apps for mobile that

19:53.200 --> 19:56.360
are official we have some links in the show notes you can you can run nebula on

19:56.360 --> 20:01.960
Android or iOS to be part of that flat mesh network but more importantly the

20:01.960 --> 20:06.880
two founding developers are going full-time with the project they left

20:06.880 --> 20:12.080
slack back in February and are now doing this as a full-time gig they've launched

20:12.080 --> 20:15.640
a new company yeah defined networking incorporated and they're focusing on

20:15.640 --> 20:19.960
nebula full-time man they're still like working with their former colleagues at

20:19.960 --> 20:23.360
slack and I think really grateful just that you know slack did this in an

20:23.360 --> 20:27.160
awesome way where they got to build it test it have it work internally open

20:27.160 --> 20:31.880
source it and now they can shift to just doing this all the time wow I mean yeah

20:31.880 --> 20:36.240
it really seems like it's one of those ideal situations where they talk to the

20:36.240 --> 20:40.320
people at slack and they said we have this thing it's taking off this is what

20:40.320 --> 20:43.840
we need to focus on and slack said yeah but we're using this in production we

20:43.840 --> 20:48.120
need to keep working with you and they came up with a way to amicably split and

20:48.120 --> 20:54.080
they've done it well and didn't continue to test new releases on slacks production

20:54.080 --> 20:57.640
network that's crazy so good for us it just seems like such a neat like this is

20:57.640 --> 21:00.280
possible partly I think because it's open source right you don't have to

21:00.280 --> 21:03.160
don't worry about this stuff slack contribute to it internally from their

21:03.160 --> 21:08.520
own engineers still this new company can focus on it and nebula just exists as an

21:08.520 --> 21:12.320
open source project yeah I need to play more with it you know that there's you

21:12.320 --> 21:16.040
know upgraded mobile support yes yes they've been toying with that for a

21:16.040 --> 21:19.680
while but and they actually are tying in on the iOS level at the kernel with the

21:19.680 --> 21:23.360
kernel VPN module so it's like full-fledged ever it'll work with every

21:23.360 --> 21:26.640
app it was really well done like the wire guard support is yeah exactly

21:26.640 --> 21:31.880
it's funny that these two open source free software VPN like solutions that we

21:31.880 --> 21:36.600
keep talking about nebula and wire guard they are really first-class mobile

21:36.600 --> 21:39.800
experiences to the developers were keenly aware that they needed to be on

21:39.800 --> 21:42.840
mobile doesn't that show you the times yeah but it's true I mean like that's a

21:42.840 --> 21:45.960
huge benefit and the whole thing about nebula is having this one flat network

21:45.960 --> 21:49.440
of all your devices but if the device I use most commonly can't be part of it

21:49.440 --> 21:53.000
it's not maybe as useful yeah like I want to get to my notes or I want to

21:53.000 --> 21:56.380
back up some photos from my phone or stuff running at your home land if you

21:56.380 --> 21:59.680
haven't checked out nebula go listen to Linux own plug slash three two nine and

21:59.680 --> 22:03.400
get a taste of what it could offer it could solve some problems that you may

22:03.400 --> 22:08.440
have been kicking around they found it very useful congrats to Ryan and Nate

22:08.440 --> 22:14.220
totally very excited for them all right so last story of the week and this is

22:14.220 --> 22:21.400
one that's been getting getting some grief and the headline reads the AMD

22:21.400 --> 22:27.880
Radeon graphics driver makes up roughly ten point five percent of the entire

22:27.880 --> 22:35.600
Linux kernel it's a bit of code shaming through size is what's happening here at

22:35.600 --> 22:41.240
scale and and we're looking at the five nine kernel and there's about twenty

22:41.240 --> 22:46.480
point four nine million lines of code and more right when you include

22:46.480 --> 22:50.320
comments and you know like three point five eight lines of code comments three

22:50.320 --> 22:55.440
point seventy two million lines just blank lines something like twenty seven

22:55.440 --> 22:59.680
point eight one total lines of code in five dot nine I mean for a while the AMD

22:59.680 --> 23:04.660
GPU kernel driver driver has been huge making it the largest entry kernel

23:04.660 --> 23:09.640
driver easily but with Linux five nine comes that additional two point one six

23:09.640 --> 23:14.000
million lines of code plus you know even more than that when you include comments

23:14.000 --> 23:19.640
and line spaces and all of that and a lot of it is auto generated headers for

23:19.640 --> 23:23.320
GPU registers that's what one point seven nine million lines of the Linux

23:23.320 --> 23:28.840
five nine code are it's just a lot of generated header files but I had an

23:28.840 --> 23:33.360
actual like insightful comment I came across on hacker news like hey when does

23:33.360 --> 23:36.840
that happen right it's occasionally well it happens when it's a comment that's

23:36.840 --> 23:41.320
made by a kernel developer so this is a comment that will link to on hacker news

23:41.320 --> 23:46.160
from brood bucket and it goes my two cents as a kernel developer the driver

23:46.160 --> 23:49.880
is pretty abominable compared to the code quality of the rest of the Linux

23:49.880 --> 23:54.000
kernel however and I think this is the point we should all take here having a

23:54.000 --> 24:00.400
GPU driver not just be open source but upstream in the Linux kernel is a

24:00.400 --> 24:05.720
gigantic deal that's why I don't like the code shaming I don't like it when we

24:05.720 --> 24:09.080
look at the lines of code and we and we oh look at all these lines of code and

24:09.080 --> 24:13.560
then we kind of code shame it when it's like as a from AMD's position it's like

24:13.560 --> 24:17.120
well you wanted us to open source the code and contributed upstream what did

24:17.120 --> 24:20.440
you expect it's got to be what they're thinking right like so we finally do

24:20.440 --> 24:23.720
what you ask and now you're bitching that it's too much code one you know

24:23.720 --> 24:26.240
there's some cultural differences I think a lot of this hardware or an

24:26.240 --> 24:28.600
embedded world you know you just have this duplication you've got similar

24:28.600 --> 24:31.440
boards that are slightly different you copy the code base you make the changes

24:31.440 --> 24:35.120
you need it's not this like highly polished Linux kernel type open source

24:35.120 --> 24:38.400
atmosphere so there's a little mix-match and to kind of bounce off

24:38.400 --> 24:42.600
your point a little more they're revving the GPU one or two times a year so

24:42.600 --> 24:46.320
there's a lot of change right much more than what you see in the x86 or even in

24:46.320 --> 24:50.440
the ARM world this commenter goes on to say kernel development takes a long time

24:50.440 --> 24:55.840
we have millions of lines of code in the AMD GPU driver and if every one of those

24:55.840 --> 24:58.880
dealt with the lengthy review process it would have never made it into the tree

24:58.880 --> 25:04.080
so it's a necessary evil they say I do wish they would clean it up I've even

25:04.080 --> 25:08.960
sent some fixes upstream for them to fix things up where there is massively

25:08.960 --> 25:12.680
largely duplicated files and that kind of stuff just doesn't fly anywhere else

25:12.680 --> 25:17.400
in the kernel but it's kind of like the compromise you make to get something as

25:17.400 --> 25:22.720
complicated as a GPU driver that covers such a wide span of not just

25:22.720 --> 25:26.960
architectures but different vendor implementations of those boards it's a

25:26.960 --> 25:34.080
massive chunk of code and perhaps gives us a little bit of insight into why

25:34.080 --> 25:38.520
Nvidia keeps its card so close to its chest right this is something that the

25:38.520 --> 25:41.520
company released after they knew it was gonna be public and they took they

25:41.520 --> 25:45.520
probably went through a process oh yeah right yeah to vet go through maybe clean

25:45.520 --> 25:50.480
up right and so can in Nvidia having not done that work it probably isn't a lot

25:50.480 --> 25:55.560
less publicly polished state yeah well and you know the other the other part

25:55.560 --> 26:00.160
here to sort of unsaid is you know this commenter submitted a change in the fix

26:00.160 --> 26:03.400
so like having it in the kernel while it doesn't mean it's where we might want it

26:03.400 --> 26:07.040
to the extent possible like fixes can be applied the kernel community is in

26:07.040 --> 26:11.480
control it would be funny though in a alternate reality where Nvidia has just

26:11.480 --> 26:14.560
all of a sudden released their code and it was also about this size and then

26:14.560 --> 26:20.880
like 20% of the kernel is just I mean it's already huge chunk of drivers yeah

26:20.880 --> 26:24.760
really seriously I feel like people don't understand the complexity of like

26:24.760 --> 26:29.520
what you have to do to deal with another processor on your computer that has to

26:29.520 --> 26:37.280
just do stuff and unlike normal as you know CPU processors which if you look at

26:37.280 --> 26:40.680
the kernel code is not an insignificant chunk in its own right based on all the

26:40.680 --> 26:45.320
different architectures and whatnot but GPUs have to deal with multiple

26:45.320 --> 26:51.120
different instruction interfaces you've got GL you've got glass you've got

26:51.120 --> 26:56.680
Vulcan you have direct 3d like all of these things happen in the GPU and I'm

26:56.680 --> 27:01.280
not even talking about the compute stuff like open CL you know and spare V and

27:01.280 --> 27:05.080
and all that other stuff yeah fair point and they're they are essentially like

27:05.080 --> 27:10.480
another computer in the computer and they are a constantly moving target plus

27:10.480 --> 27:14.680
then you have all of the management code that is necessary to just get those

27:14.680 --> 27:18.520
frames onto the screen for the different operating systems I mean it's it there's

27:18.520 --> 27:22.280
a lot to it for sure so I just I'd say yes it does seem like a lot of code

27:22.280 --> 27:25.000
clearly does seem like there's some room for improvement but I don't know if I

27:25.000 --> 27:29.760
like the idea of campaigning for years to get code released and then code

27:29.760 --> 27:33.040
shaming when they do it it just doesn't feel quite right but I guess there is

27:33.040 --> 27:36.400
probably a room for improvement to mr. Payne there's some room for improvement

27:36.400 --> 27:43.960
around here it's a mess let's do a little housekeeping around here mini Mac

27:43.960 --> 27:47.720
rumor has it that there is something special going on for the luck log this

27:47.720 --> 27:52.880
Sunday indeed it is in fact we would like to talk about browser experience

27:52.880 --> 27:58.480
how you harden your browser what browser do you use and how do you handle cookies

27:58.480 --> 28:04.040
and stuff like that so we try to get a group together that's talking about

28:04.040 --> 28:09.320
their experiences with browsers and with extensions they have and it would be

28:09.320 --> 28:14.120
cold if you join us and even if you have some input we would be really happy to

28:14.120 --> 28:19.480
hear from you yeah you can find the love plug on Sundays at noon Pacific it's on

28:19.480 --> 28:24.040
the Jupiter broadcasting calendar and we have the mumble server info at Linux

28:24.040 --> 28:28.040
unplug calm link there at the top you get that set up you join in the lobby and

28:28.040 --> 28:32.680
you hang out with a bunch of other Linux loving users and this week talk about

28:32.680 --> 28:38.440
browsers I think it's been browsers are actually once again going from boring to

28:38.440 --> 28:41.920
interesting all over again so it's a good time to talk about that I also want

28:41.920 --> 28:45.440
to suggest you consider grabbing the Jupiter broadcasting all shows feed you

28:45.440 --> 28:48.560
never know what we have in the works or what we might put out in that feed and

28:48.560 --> 28:53.480
get every show place to find it yeah everything it's like the ultimate JB

28:53.480 --> 28:57.080
experience the Jupiter broadcasting all shows feed is in your podcatcher of

28:57.080 --> 29:01.720
choice or linked on our website at Jupiter broadcasting comm let's check

29:01.720 --> 29:04.360
it out I also we should just put a link in the show notes let's do that we'll

29:04.360 --> 29:08.320
put a link in the show notes too and we'd love to have you subscribe and get

29:08.320 --> 29:13.160
everything that we put out because we have learned many things over the years

29:13.160 --> 29:17.560
and we've learned kind of what Jupiter broadcasting focuses and we're really

29:17.560 --> 29:20.600
proud of everything we produce like if you're not listening to self-hosted or

29:20.600 --> 29:25.280
Kota radio or Linux action news you're missing out on some great content that's

29:25.280 --> 29:32.360
all in the all shows feed over at Jupiter broadcasting.com all right so we

29:32.360 --> 29:36.560
wanted to try something new the exit interview after we've used a

29:36.560 --> 29:40.120
distribution for a while instead of giving you the review when we first try

29:40.120 --> 29:43.720
it we're gonna give you our thoughts after we've used it for a little while

29:43.720 --> 29:48.600
but I wanted to do it for pop OS which is the current version as we record is

29:48.600 --> 29:52.640
based on 2004 god you this is this is really embarrassing this is

29:52.640 --> 29:58.160
embarrassing for two reasons actually for me to talk about number one I shit

29:58.160 --> 30:01.200
on it when it first came out just gonna say it I did I did I didn't think it was

30:01.200 --> 30:05.320
a good idea and then skeptical and then I ran my mouth like multiple times on

30:05.320 --> 30:08.120
multiple shows about it so I got it I got to eat my hat on that I don't

30:08.120 --> 30:12.840
normally get get it wrong so badly but that's when I got it wrong on and I got

30:12.840 --> 30:17.360
to admit that it's also embarrassing because system 76 is a sponsor of Linux

30:17.360 --> 30:20.840
action news and Kota radio that may cause people to think that is influenced

30:20.840 --> 30:26.400
my thoughts but those two things have no bearing on what my opinions are of the

30:26.400 --> 30:31.240
pop OS desktop itself and the experience that I walked away on a Dell so I loaded

30:31.240 --> 30:34.440
it on this precision that I am going to give you guys a review but I loaded it

30:34.440 --> 30:39.840
on this precision because it has a badass quadro in video card in it it's

30:39.840 --> 30:49.000
got an MVME SSD it's got a gorgeous edge to edge 17 inch 4k display beautiful

30:49.000 --> 30:55.480
right I mean it is the creme de la creme of Dell precision laptops and I wanted

30:55.480 --> 30:59.260
to see what the system 76 pop OS experience was like because they have

30:59.260 --> 31:05.680
focused on a lot on high DPI and the general I would say kind of you know

31:05.680 --> 31:08.880
word on the street about pop OS is it's great if you want a game which is

31:08.880 --> 31:12.120
exactly what I wanted to do for a little bit you know part of the review is to

31:12.120 --> 31:15.400
put it through gaming paces and so I spend a couple of weekends trying

31:15.400 --> 31:18.720
different games on it just seemed like pop OS would be a good way to go as I do

31:18.720 --> 31:23.080
is I start using it I run into things or I start having questions and I have the

31:23.080 --> 31:26.320
privilege of being able to call up the people at system 76 and so I did just

31:26.320 --> 31:30.160
that and I asked them some questions about it and got a few clarifications

31:30.160 --> 31:35.120
on strategy and stuff and I thought I'd share some of those experiences as I'm

31:35.120 --> 31:39.040
now taking it off that Dell I'm gonna I'm gonna remove it so I wanted to just

31:39.040 --> 31:42.880
share my thoughts as I transition off of pop OS yeah you spent some time with pop

31:42.880 --> 31:47.400
really lived in it yeah this I swear is not hyperbole but it sure sounds like it

31:47.400 --> 31:53.400
when I what I'm about to say is I think with pop OS they have something no other

31:53.400 --> 31:57.560
distribution has and if I were to boil it down into a couple of things and I'll

31:57.560 --> 32:04.520
expand on that it is limited scope of what they have to address and it is

32:04.520 --> 32:09.480
sustainability and staffing sustainability and staffing let's go

32:09.480 --> 32:12.920
with those two honestly not a lot of distros even have that they don't

32:12.920 --> 32:16.320
necessarily have full-time people it's it's the exception of the exception like

32:16.320 --> 32:21.000
we can count on our one hand what distributions have full-time desktop

32:21.000 --> 32:24.600
staff yeah right I mean like many open-source projects there's a lot of

32:24.600 --> 32:28.120
volunteer time or an off-hours time or a lot of integration of upstream right

32:28.120 --> 32:31.200
that's essentially what the volunteers are integrating upstream and it's the

32:31.200 --> 32:34.320
good work of upstream that is making these distributions possible and then

32:34.320 --> 32:38.480
they these volunteers will theme it or they will modify it or they'll bring

32:38.480 --> 32:41.440
some of their own special sauce to it but they choose put things together yeah

32:41.440 --> 32:44.720
but they're not working a nine-to-five they're not commuting into an office to

32:44.720 --> 32:48.960
go work on that thing they're not building software that is at the scope

32:48.960 --> 32:54.920
of like say the system 76 firmware tool right even if system 76 say has three

32:54.920 --> 33:00.480
people working on pop OS that's three more people than just about any other

33:00.480 --> 33:04.000
distribution has when you look at all the distributions out there but

33:04.000 --> 33:09.760
additionally because they've decided to ship Ubuntu well that the desktop team

33:09.760 --> 33:14.120
at canonical is doing some of the heavy lifting there and they're shipping the

33:14.120 --> 33:18.680
heavy lifting that the GNOME desktop team is doing right system 76 hasn't

33:18.680 --> 33:21.880
come up with their own desktop environment there's no you know there's

33:21.880 --> 33:26.340
no system 76 desktop they have taken the hard work of the Giants underneath them

33:26.340 --> 33:32.040
and what's left is something that their small team can easily address yeah right

33:32.040 --> 33:34.640
and they're they're working directly with customers they've got an interesting

33:34.640 --> 33:38.440
sort of vantage point hearing people using their desktops and figuring out

33:38.440 --> 33:41.280
where maybe there are some rough edges and they're in a position to actually

33:41.280 --> 33:45.120
not just hope upstream fixes it but fix that themselves right the support

33:45.120 --> 33:49.280
department acts as sort of a unique feedback cycle to the development

33:49.280 --> 33:55.360
features that go back into pop OS again that's unique but additionally when we

33:55.360 --> 34:01.400
talk about sustainability system 76 has come up with a way to make it viable to

34:01.400 --> 34:05.480
release a Linux distribution for free to anyone and they distribute it via

34:05.480 --> 34:10.720
digital ocean spaces so even downloading it cost yeah right it's fast but they're

34:10.720 --> 34:14.480
paying for it so they have come up with a scheme in which they can give the

34:14.480 --> 34:17.880
distribution away for free but still have a sustainable funding model because

34:17.880 --> 34:22.440
of the benefits and features it brings their laptops and they have a while it's

34:22.440 --> 34:25.760
a small team they can do things like work on auto tiling and because they

34:25.760 --> 34:28.680
have time to do the research they'll base it on something like TypeScript

34:28.680 --> 34:32.800
which is much more sustainable and portable well yeah I mean if you've ever

34:32.800 --> 34:37.240
used the GNOME flavor of JavaScript it works just fine but you don't have all

34:37.240 --> 34:40.160
the niceties of modern JavaScript by choosing TypeScript not only do you have

34:40.160 --> 34:42.800
the nice TypeScript compiler to help you out but you've also got all the

34:42.800 --> 34:46.600
abilities of modern JavaScript tools access to library ecosystems if you need

34:46.600 --> 34:50.160
that and a much friendlier development experience if they were maybe choosing

34:50.160 --> 34:53.320
other features maybe I would have a different opinion but what they focused

34:53.320 --> 34:59.680
on is auto tiling that seems to work for mortals they've brought fractional

34:59.680 --> 35:05.080
scaling to standard GNOME shell yeah they have enabled just recently hybrid

35:05.080 --> 35:08.800
graphics for external displays which is kind of a big deal for a lot of

35:08.800 --> 35:13.800
customers who are buying nice GPUs it's workstation features yeah right I mean

35:13.800 --> 35:16.960
they they realized that the firmware updates were the thing that needed to

35:16.960 --> 35:20.600
happen the customers weren't going to want addressed in a good way and they

35:20.600 --> 35:26.480
were early on that game they can work on these 10% gap closure features because

35:26.480 --> 35:30.580
they're they're building on all of the work of the other projects and then they

35:30.580 --> 35:35.880
can focus in on that kind of stuff if I could wave a magic wand and make pop OS

35:35.880 --> 35:41.720
anything I want I might prefer to have it based on something like art oh no

35:41.720 --> 35:46.720
that's an idea you know but a second pretty good second desktop it would be

35:46.720 --> 35:50.920
Ubuntu LTS or an Ubuntu base right I mean I also I feel very comfortable with

35:50.920 --> 35:54.000
it I can have all the benefits of pop but I still feel like under the system

35:54.000 --> 35:58.120
you know I can do whatever server side things on my desktop I need and so that

35:58.120 --> 36:01.320
actually makes it a pretty reasonable choice too if I'm not gonna run arch on

36:01.320 --> 36:05.840
the desktop I'm probably going to run an Ubuntu flavor or something like pop OS

36:05.840 --> 36:09.240
because it just well it just makes running meant running a lot of

36:09.240 --> 36:13.320
applications I want to run simpler it just it's one step removed supported

36:13.320 --> 36:16.080
environment yeah it's one step removed from being on one of the commercial

36:16.080 --> 36:21.560
platforms essentially and so you get those benefits and pop as well and then

36:21.560 --> 36:24.600
you look at some of the other choices they've made like the installer they

36:24.600 --> 36:28.960
worked with elementary OS they didn't go out and and like create their own

36:28.960 --> 36:33.480
proprietary installer instead they funded development for an elementary OS

36:33.480 --> 36:36.560
to create a free installer that they collaborated with elementary OS to

36:36.560 --> 36:40.520
modify it for pop OS and now pop OS has a better installer than Ubuntu does

36:40.520 --> 36:45.400
it's real nice the pop shop is better than gnome software yep and it's just

36:45.400 --> 36:49.880
simpler and cleaner and faster and it looks better too yeah everything feels

36:49.880 --> 36:53.480
very integrated it feels like a holistic integrate you know complete experience

36:53.480 --> 36:57.040
so you've got you've got something unique here in that you've got dedicated

36:57.040 --> 37:00.520
development time by people that where it's actually their job and they're held

37:00.520 --> 37:05.920
accountable and they have features they need to ship to match product releases so

37:05.920 --> 37:10.480
there's actually that drive to ship you have a sustainable system where they can

37:10.480 --> 37:13.240
give the distribution away for free to people that want to run it on their own

37:13.240 --> 37:17.760
hardware but yet it still returns enough value for them on their hardware that

37:17.760 --> 37:23.200
they can justify the cost to make it and you have them developing features that

37:23.200 --> 37:28.600
close the gap that add usability and pro features like keyboard navigation of

37:28.600 --> 37:32.760
gnome shell is a lot better on pop OS you could you can you almost don't even

37:32.760 --> 37:37.560
need the mouse now and and the reality the reality of that is that it's while

37:37.560 --> 37:41.400
developed at for pop OS it is being upstreamed it's available it's open

37:41.400 --> 37:45.080
source code so they're they're also doing that aspect of the good open source

37:45.080 --> 37:50.440
citizen aspect when you take any one of those slices like auto tiling or

37:50.440 --> 37:55.640
independent development staff or any of that you slice it on its own I mean it's

37:55.640 --> 38:01.160
neat it's good yeah but when you total it up in totality I think it makes pop OS

38:01.160 --> 38:07.160
a very unique distribution that I didn't fully appreciate until I saw a few

38:07.160 --> 38:11.800
iterations of it and then spent a half a month with her three weeks with it and

38:11.800 --> 38:18.360
realized oh oh it does feel like it's very broad appeal in a way that sort of

38:18.360 --> 38:21.720
surprised me as well like I'd feel comfortable letting my mom use it but

38:21.720 --> 38:25.000
I'd also be entirely comfortable having it as my you know workstation desktop in

38:25.000 --> 38:29.240
the office yeah that's what I'm thinking about you know eventually when I do get

38:29.240 --> 38:35.480
my own laptop I kind of assumed I would just go mangero plasma and watching

38:35.480 --> 38:39.040
gnome shell it we know you know what it started with it started when we started

38:39.040 --> 38:47.400
beta testing fedora 33 it's so nice to be home it really felt like going home

38:47.400 --> 38:53.320
yeah yeah and I thought okay so then I actually put fedora 33 first on the Dell

38:53.320 --> 38:57.400
I can't remember do you remember why I think I was troubleshooting some sound

38:57.400 --> 39:01.400
card issues or something completely unrelated and so I tried out Ubuntu 2010

39:01.400 --> 39:04.880
and then I tried out pop OS 2004 and stayed if it's funny because it's so I

39:04.880 --> 39:09.760
just recently did a snap snapshot of 33 2010 pop OS and pop OS is the one I

39:09.760 --> 39:14.760
stayed home with gnome shell at the dark mode and you guys if you listen to these

39:14.760 --> 39:18.160
shows for a while know that we've gone on about like trying out regolith and

39:18.160 --> 39:22.080
we've done different discussions about tiling window managers and I always end

39:22.080 --> 39:25.580
up just going back to to wanting a windowed environment but having the

39:25.580 --> 39:31.120
auto tiling built in where I turn it on and then about once a day for an hour I

39:31.120 --> 39:34.680
turn it off for that particular work thing and then all the other times I

39:34.680 --> 39:40.400
just click a button in my toolbar and it's on and it's so much nicer it's so

39:40.400 --> 39:43.320
much nicer plus they have an option where you can highlight the window

39:43.320 --> 39:46.480
that's active with like a border and that's just a little bit quicker for

39:46.480 --> 39:48.640
when I come back to my machine I can just look immediately at the screen I

39:48.640 --> 39:51.960
know what is the active windows I don't start typing in the wrong chat box it's

39:51.960 --> 39:56.640
very practical I really like it I really it's like the first auto tiling that's

39:56.640 --> 40:00.320
ever stuck for me it just makes it better doesn't get in your way it's easy

40:00.320 --> 40:03.840
to turn off if you don't want it just enhances you know I can't believe that

40:03.840 --> 40:08.120
got me because you know the thing is is if I could have anything I would just

40:08.120 --> 40:12.280
have all of this be in one in mainline Ubuntu you know that would be the

40:12.280 --> 40:15.320
mainline Ubuntu just has all this stuff but that's not the world we live in

40:15.320 --> 40:19.720
it's just just not there it's just not the reality I also I have to be

40:19.720 --> 40:25.480
completely frank I prefer that pop shop defaults to Debs you know it'll it'll go

40:25.480 --> 40:28.360
for like that when I install telegram it installs the deb of telegram and the

40:28.360 --> 40:31.800
reason why I like that is because when I'm sending and receiving attachments I

40:31.800 --> 40:36.400
just want to be on my actual file system and I like the faster startup time of

40:36.400 --> 40:41.080
the of the deb file and I launched telegram every day so I prefer that

40:41.080 --> 40:44.360
about pop shop too there's just little things like the installers a little bit

40:44.360 --> 40:48.880
better auto tiling the theme means better the software install looks they

40:48.880 --> 40:53.000
install by default a very practical tool to just be able to double click and

40:53.000 --> 40:56.520
install a deb file without having to launch the entire software center it's

40:56.520 --> 40:59.320
like yeah that's these little tiny things that all really add up plus the

40:59.320 --> 41:05.040
development focus I think make it kind of a special contender I I mean I'm not

41:05.040 --> 41:08.880
switching anything to it today but I think when I do get my next laptop I

41:08.880 --> 41:12.880
think I'm gonna go pop I think that's gonna be the way of the future for me

41:12.880 --> 41:15.680
especially if it's one that has a video cut in it if I'm gonna do a little

41:15.680 --> 41:19.880
gaming I went well super solid I know you gave it a little bit of a go to how

41:19.880 --> 41:22.920
did your Steam experience go yeah that was actually really pleasant you know I

41:22.920 --> 41:27.120
just installed it right from the pop shop loaded everything up and played

41:27.120 --> 41:31.360
very nicely much better than the previous gaming setup I had mm-hmm yeah

41:31.360 --> 41:34.680
yeah I was just thinking about it for my son if I was gonna reload my son's

41:34.680 --> 41:38.360
machine I think I'd elementary's work so well but I could see elementary for some

41:38.360 --> 41:43.000
of my family and then pop for the more technically inclined members of my

41:43.000 --> 41:46.240
family right that'll probably be the distro I start recommending to people

41:46.240 --> 41:49.520
when they asked me what distro should they switch to move from windows it's a

41:49.520 --> 41:54.320
big change for you yeah I'm pretty impressed and I think I think part of

41:54.320 --> 41:59.040
what my calculus is is assuming that system 76 takes this trajectory and

41:59.040 --> 42:04.120
runs with it right and kind of he builds on where they're going yeah if they if

42:04.120 --> 42:08.880
they fade on it then my opinion of this is gonna change you know but right now

42:08.880 --> 42:13.120
if they continue their current trajectory or even add to it I mean then

42:13.120 --> 42:17.600
we're really talking about something special and I was an idiot I was an

42:17.600 --> 42:21.000
idiot for getting it wrong well I think it was just you know we some of the

42:21.000 --> 42:24.400
things that have worked out in their advantage of finding the right levels to

42:24.400 --> 42:27.280
contribute I think that's where we were skeptical we're kind of like well do we

42:27.280 --> 42:32.120
just need this you know additional theme or this customization but what the work

42:32.120 --> 42:34.720
they've put in it really made a bigger difference than I would have guessed

42:34.720 --> 42:40.160
yeah so I really recommend you check it out this is the you know so I guess our

42:40.160 --> 42:45.000
exit interview is you are a better performer than we expected in just about

42:45.000 --> 42:49.360
every every single category they have also some slightly different software

42:49.360 --> 42:53.420
selections available in the pop shop that I think are kind of nice and all of

42:53.420 --> 42:57.280
that just made it really simple to get up and going and just keep it all up to

42:57.280 --> 43:01.160
date really easily that's it it feels tasteful to me I think you can really

43:01.160 --> 43:05.960
tell that you know the folks that system 76 use and love desktop Linux are in all

43:05.960 --> 43:10.720
about that and are using pop as they're working on pop and so it's just feels

43:10.720 --> 43:14.480
already well lived in and makes me comfortable you and I were speculating

43:14.480 --> 43:19.800
like will this long-term payoff for them will it create like the iPod style halo

43:19.800 --> 43:24.000
effect where today you buy an iPod tomorrow you buy a Mac will pop OS

43:24.000 --> 43:28.440
users like me who are running it on Dell hardware would we be more inclined to

43:28.440 --> 43:32.880
buy a system of 76 machine think I've had a great time here on pop maybe I'll

43:32.880 --> 43:37.600
uh yeah just get the real deal that I'm I could see it but I'm a little more

43:37.600 --> 43:40.960
skeptical because it's not like it's not like the brand is smacking you in the

43:40.960 --> 43:46.040
face anywhere like I don't even see it really so maybe I mean I could see the

43:46.040 --> 43:51.000
argument that it keeps the system 76 brand for front your mind so maybe when

43:51.000 --> 43:54.680
the time comes and you're thinking hey I want to buy a computer well they do a

43:54.680 --> 43:59.360
good job with their operating system yeah maybe I don't know I'd be curious

43:59.360 --> 44:02.440
to punt that one to the mumble room does anybody have any thoughts does does

44:02.440 --> 44:07.560
creating a distribution that you end up running on HP hardware or something does

44:07.560 --> 44:11.900
it make you more inclined what well I don't know Toshiba maybe you have an

44:11.900 --> 44:16.080
old Toshiba satellite I don't know it's a rockin but what does it make someone

44:16.080 --> 44:19.320
more inclined you think to maybe want to purchase the hardware later when the

44:19.320 --> 44:25.920
time comes I don't know so like if the aspect of it being made by system 76

44:25.920 --> 44:32.320
might be a little bit more prominent in pop OS it would it may introduce some

44:32.320 --> 44:37.500
kind of interesting effect where people see that you know pop OS is from system

44:37.500 --> 44:42.520
76 and they make integrated computers and that provides like a best of class

44:42.520 --> 44:47.680
experience with it maybe but on the other hand I don't think that's the

44:47.680 --> 44:51.920
point of pop OS because and it kind of shows and how they think about it and

44:51.920 --> 44:56.040
how they release it and how they brand it I think they make pop OS you know

44:56.040 --> 45:02.240
just to so that they have an area in which they can drive their own opinions

45:02.240 --> 45:07.360
about how a desktop experience should evolve and how it should support how

45:07.360 --> 45:13.080
they feel it should support their users and that itself is shipped on their

45:13.080 --> 45:17.240
hardware because of course they make hardware but they're totally okay with

45:17.240 --> 45:20.720
supporting other hardware as long as it's supported by their upstream

45:20.720 --> 45:27.120
distribution because the point of pop OS isn't to drive people to system 76

45:27.120 --> 45:34.540
hardware the point of pop OS is to drive people to their opinion of how a Linux

45:34.540 --> 45:40.120
desktop should function sure and maybe in the future drive them to a custom 76

45:40.120 --> 45:43.640
keyboard because like I can see the way this is going so if anybody tries out

45:43.640 --> 45:47.220
this auto tiling extension one of the things I recommend you do is bring up

45:47.220 --> 45:51.600
the keyboard shortcuts and look at what you can do in in gnome shell now from

45:51.600 --> 45:54.400
the keyboard and tell me that that doesn't get extracted out into the

45:54.400 --> 45:58.720
future when they ship this system 76 custom design keyboard that happens to

45:58.720 --> 46:02.640
work great with pop OS I mean it's gonna be a perfect it's gonna be a perfect

46:02.640 --> 46:06.720
combo I mean if I'm running pop OS at that time I might buy the keyboard you

46:06.720 --> 46:12.280
know back in the day when we had the computer it was like oh cool I can

46:12.280 --> 46:17.360
install for example Ubuntu on it you put it on and there was pretty much always

46:17.360 --> 46:22.800
one thing that didn't work and that annoyed me and it also was one of the

46:22.800 --> 46:27.000
things where I couldn't promote Linux to other user that there were like yeah but

46:27.000 --> 46:32.560
there's also always something little things that don't work and you always

46:32.560 --> 46:37.920
have to think tinker with it and what pop OS is doing is standardizing hardware

46:37.920 --> 46:44.800
where they can provide support so this way you can promote it to a family like

46:44.800 --> 46:48.360
okay this is going to work and you don't have any problems with it if you've got

46:48.360 --> 46:52.240
some problem with it you can report it and they will fix it and this is also

46:52.240 --> 46:59.560
where companies get more and more more comfortable by purchasing hardware from

46:59.560 --> 47:04.280
for example pop OS with the surface they can get with it and this way there is

47:04.280 --> 47:08.960
more and more adopting of Linux because their standardization of hardware with

47:08.960 --> 47:13.520
software right it kind of means it's a it's like a safe bet in a way because

47:13.520 --> 47:17.280
you know that the vendors integrated it but also they have us they have a

47:17.280 --> 47:21.080
support system for it too a long time ago there was also on the show where

47:21.080 --> 47:25.680
someone tried to sell the software and they were like yeah it's free and

47:25.680 --> 47:32.840
companies didn't bite for it right and when they sold it with the support and

47:32.840 --> 47:38.360
the software was free with the support companies started buying it yes an old

47:38.360 --> 47:42.320
an old lesson there I so there's two things that this makes me kind of come

47:42.320 --> 47:47.840
to like if we were to shoot this way out number one is system 76 more compelled

47:47.840 --> 47:52.600
to brand the UI in a way perhaps to bring their branding more forward to the

47:52.600 --> 47:56.040
user could that shop you know and we've seen this we've seen a mistake here in

47:56.040 --> 48:00.560
the past like with canonical never really got over the putting the Amazon

48:00.560 --> 48:04.120
links in the search results I mean but you know is there something they could

48:04.120 --> 48:07.720
do that would make system 76 more front of mind you could see going that

48:07.720 --> 48:12.120
direction perhaps one day maybe not and and if Neil's analysis is correct then

48:12.120 --> 48:15.240
there would really be no motivation for that but yeah my other thought on this

48:15.240 --> 48:20.680
is is this a play we start to see become much more common and we're starting to

48:20.680 --> 48:26.420
see it now with announcements of distribution a with hardware why and a

48:26.420 --> 48:30.360
partnership between the distribution and the laptop maker or whatever right we're

48:30.360 --> 48:35.360
seeing a lot more of that and I wonder if that isn't sort of a validation of

48:35.360 --> 48:41.600
hardware integration with software does provide extra value to the customer I

48:41.600 --> 48:45.520
think we're seeing that when you start to see all these projects that have

48:45.520 --> 48:51.280
announced laptops like just this morning slim book which is a spec is a Spanish

48:51.280 --> 48:55.920
laptop maker or a PC maker because they actually do make desktops as well they

48:55.920 --> 48:59.920
announced they're now shipping the slim book essential an affordable sub 500

48:59.920 --> 49:05.760
euro laptop they're shipping with fedora and they're they they do the work and

49:05.760 --> 49:09.640
they work with the distributions to kind of you know make sure their hardware and

49:09.640 --> 49:13.680
software work together and I think what this is what this what this kind of goes

49:13.680 --> 49:18.460
to what you're saying Chris is that the the key issue that has always been the

49:18.460 --> 49:22.120
case and I think even Linus Torvalds has said it like back in the days of when

49:22.120 --> 49:27.320
Linux world was a conference and you know he's he's always said that the

49:27.320 --> 49:31.240
reason that Linux doesn't win in the desktop is because there are no pre

49:31.240 --> 49:36.320
loaded Linux on computers that's changing and it's happening at big

49:36.320 --> 49:41.920
vendors and small vendors you've got tuxedo slim book system 76 Dell Lenovo

49:41.920 --> 49:47.000
Hewlett Packard and others like it's just starting to happen everywhere it's

49:47.000 --> 49:57.000
happening Dan Johnson in the mumble room has some breaking news for us as we wrap

49:57.000 --> 50:04.400
up the show here man jero arm 2010 has been released and you have anything you

50:04.400 --> 50:10.000
want to share with the class on this on this fresh new release well updated

50:10.000 --> 50:15.760
kernels and laser stacks on most of the devices hey that seems great I'm looking

50:15.760 --> 50:20.040
at it right now it looks like a pretty nice plasma image is available so are

50:20.040 --> 50:24.320
you spinning these images yourself yeah oh thank you for all of the hard work

50:24.320 --> 50:28.840
this is a lot of images you're spinning you got us you have sway of course you

50:28.840 --> 50:32.800
haven't for the Pine Book and Pine Book rock pro 6-4 you have it for the

50:32.800 --> 50:37.640
Raspberry Pi this is a big matrix of download options yeah that must have how

50:37.640 --> 50:41.920
long does it take you to do all of that well talking in there about 12 hours now

50:41.920 --> 50:46.280
oh well thank you for doing the good work we'll have a link to that in the

50:46.280 --> 50:50.160
show notes so people can go grab that before we go into the feedback though I

50:50.160 --> 50:54.560
want to thank a cloud group we're sponsoring this episode of the unplugged program they've

50:54.560 --> 50:58.720
got a course that might be good for you especially if you are administering a

50:58.720 --> 51:04.520
system with system D they have system D management for Linux we'll have a link

51:04.520 --> 51:10.680
in the show notes this course has 5.8 hours of content 40 total lessons and

51:10.680 --> 51:16.340
eight hands-on labs yes it is a course designed to help you demystify system D

51:16.340 --> 51:19.760
you can get things done in system D perhaps today already but did you know

51:19.760 --> 51:24.160
there's more and more added to system D all the time there's a lot to learn so

51:24.160 --> 51:26.640
you can take this course learn how components work together and how to

51:26.640 --> 51:30.500
configure manage monitor and troubleshoot system D check out the

51:30.500 --> 51:35.240
link we'll have it in the show notes at Linux unplugged slash 375 and thanks to

51:35.240 --> 51:38.580
a cloud guru for sponsoring this episode of the unplugged program go check out

51:38.580 --> 51:44.880
system D management for Linux from a cloud guru alright mr. pain

51:44.880 --> 51:52.280
after the show last week you and I had to think about the feedback and pics

51:52.280 --> 51:57.240
segment and I like what we came up with we got two emails this week and one

51:57.240 --> 52:03.760
wicked awesome pic like so so cool but I'll save that first we get to the

52:03.760 --> 52:08.220
emails this one came in from Eric and he was listening to the back catalog so I

52:08.220 --> 52:11.920
guess he just recently discovered the network and thought I'll start from the

52:11.920 --> 52:14.800
back catalog and listen up hey that's a great idea that is kind of a fun idea

52:14.800 --> 52:18.400
that would be interesting by the time he gets here I wonder what he's gonna think

52:18.400 --> 52:22.560
about about I'll catch up about all this stuff but anyways he's in that 293 right

52:22.560 --> 52:28.440
now so this is 375 some work to do but he said that in that episode we were

52:28.440 --> 52:32.240
mentioning power top and TLP which is the the power management solution for

52:32.240 --> 52:36.520
Linux he said I'd never tried TLP before I installed it thinking it would give me

52:36.520 --> 52:40.840
more battery life well not only did it do that but I also fixed a really

52:40.840 --> 52:45.120
annoying issue with my Wi-Fi where it would randomly disconnect from the

52:45.120 --> 52:48.720
network nothing I ever found on the internet and research had fixed it but

52:48.720 --> 52:55.080
somehow after I installed TLP my Wi-Fi was fixed well how about that yeah we

52:55.080 --> 52:58.080
were scratching our heads about that it must have been some sort of power

52:58.080 --> 53:02.000
management rule that was knocking his Wi-Fi off like maybe putting his card to

53:02.000 --> 53:07.120
sleep or something and TLP actually changed that to be less frequent perhaps

53:07.120 --> 53:11.320
I mean that could be right yeah I mean that sounds plausible it does but it's

53:11.320 --> 53:14.880
not the kind of thing you would expect and it really shows you how interlinked

53:14.880 --> 53:18.960
all of this stuff is and you never know trying one of our random suggestions on

53:18.960 --> 53:24.040
the show might just improve your system you never know or the reverse what's all

53:24.040 --> 53:27.600
writes into us about Chromebooks and education something I think you know a

53:27.600 --> 53:31.920
little bit about yeah all all three of my kids are using Chromebooks right now

53:31.920 --> 53:36.400
okay well here's how what's all handled that hello there longtime listener first

53:36.400 --> 53:40.160
time mailer I was writing to talk about kids using laptops specifically

53:40.160 --> 53:44.440
Chromebooks in school as we all know kids all over the country are going

53:44.440 --> 53:48.240
back to school now whether it be in person or online my oldest just started

53:48.240 --> 53:51.360
kindergarten this year we all have computers at home including him all of

53:51.360 --> 53:55.080
which run various flavors of Linux we've got a Linux household here he's never

53:55.080 --> 53:59.080
used anything else awesome so when he was getting ready to start school and

53:59.080 --> 54:02.320
they announced that they were going to be giving all students Chromebooks I of

54:02.320 --> 54:08.120
course did not agree with this at all I know right I mean talk about I know this

54:08.120 --> 54:10.780
sounds weird but I would have almost preferred they would have had them use

54:10.780 --> 54:14.920
iPads I just cuz like the the Chromebook means the Google account the Google

54:14.920 --> 54:19.800
account it's it's like you're starting your whole online identity and it works

54:19.800 --> 54:24.320
my kids think everything web first and Chrome first like even video editing and

54:24.320 --> 54:28.200
picture editing like they just browser first everything I mean it really works

54:28.200 --> 54:33.040
so Google's very clever in in pushing this so yeah when I heard that I was so

54:33.040 --> 54:36.960
disappointed but you know as a parent there's so little you can do because

54:36.960 --> 54:41.200
this is how the school does everything now like they turn their papers in this

54:41.200 --> 54:45.360
way through the Google stuff they do the classroom meet tools like everything is

54:45.360 --> 54:49.320
powered by this and that's how they're doing the entire Rona home homeschooling

54:49.320 --> 54:55.280
oh yeah okay so when let's all ran into that he writes that I called the school

54:55.280 --> 54:58.680
I spoke with his teacher the principal and even the superintendent and explained

54:58.680 --> 55:02.240
my concerns I also told them that I would be more than willing to provide an

55:02.240 --> 55:06.080
alternative for them to use and that's what it sounds like he's been able to do

55:06.080 --> 55:09.200
so it might still have the Google account integrated but at least you know

55:09.200 --> 55:12.840
instead it's on OS that he has some oversight on at least yeah his son's

55:12.840 --> 55:17.280
using a ThinkPad t420 with Kubuntu installed so how about that perfect

55:17.280 --> 55:22.280
that's great so I I could have done that I suppose I could have petitioned the

55:22.280 --> 55:26.240
principal but I did not I relented yeah and I think that's that's really the the

55:26.240 --> 55:29.800
heart of Wessel's message here is you know if you care about it if that's the

55:29.800 --> 55:34.040
right thing for your family and your setup hey doesn't hurt to ask yeah I

55:34.040 --> 55:37.520
guess that's he says for anybody that has a kid in school that got out of the

55:37.520 --> 55:39.720
Chromebook call the teacher administration and talk to them like I

55:39.720 --> 55:43.240
did you know and maybe it will work you know you can ask for a special

55:43.240 --> 55:46.520
accommodation there you might be surprised what you hear in response I

55:46.520 --> 55:49.920
wonder though if they still end up having to have a Google account I bet

55:49.920 --> 55:53.040
there's some there's got to be some integration right online management

55:53.040 --> 55:56.080
because they're using Docs and everything and meet I mean they're gonna

55:56.080 --> 55:59.480
have to be there in Google Meet for the for those school sessions yeah so I

55:59.480 --> 56:04.640
don't know what you really gain other than having full control over the OS

56:04.640 --> 56:08.760
which has its advantages but my solution there is they just use the Chromebooks

56:08.760 --> 56:13.280
for schoolwork only only yeah yeah and you know their school property too they're

56:13.280 --> 56:17.040
not bad little devices but just not what I what I would have picked all right

56:17.040 --> 56:22.120
speaking of picks how about this how about a system that automagically

56:22.120 --> 56:25.560
manages different tiers of storage for you so like imagine you got yourself

56:25.560 --> 56:29.400
some fast storage and if you access a file a lot you want it on the fast

56:29.400 --> 56:33.160
storage but then maybe you got your files that sit around like for me I have

56:33.160 --> 56:37.280
movies that will sit around that maybe get watched once every five years right

56:37.280 --> 56:40.400
you still want them but you don't need a much I don't need them on the most

56:40.400 --> 56:44.800
precious storage either and this is where our pick comes in it's called

56:44.800 --> 56:50.600
auto tier it's a pass-through fuse file system that intelligently moves files

56:50.600 --> 56:57.280
between storage tiers based on frequency of use file age and tier fullness and of

56:57.280 --> 57:01.160
course anything like this you're gonna want something that has a very easy to

57:01.160 --> 57:05.480
understand and read config file and I think that's where auto tier really

57:05.480 --> 57:10.960
nails this it's you just define two lines plus the definition tier one and

57:10.960 --> 57:13.360
then another you just define another tier and you just give it the mount

57:13.360 --> 57:16.480
point to that and then another tier and you give it the mount point to that and

57:16.480 --> 57:21.920
you can tell it what your watermark is which is essentially your water line in

57:21.920 --> 57:26.080
a tank how high do you want the storage to get and you can say I want this

57:26.080 --> 57:31.080
waterline at like 70% and then once that tier reaches 70% it's it's taken out of

57:31.080 --> 57:34.480
consideration and then it just sort of acts merging them together so you get

57:34.480 --> 57:37.920
like a transparent view you don't have to see what how all the tiers work when

57:37.920 --> 57:41.080
you're actually interacting with it through fuse I've not extensively tried

57:41.080 --> 57:45.560
this but I'm definitely give it a go I mean it's pretty neat and I could

57:45.560 --> 57:50.240
really see you could have online discs that are you could even I mean you could

57:50.240 --> 57:54.920
even do something like where you mount some sort of like backblaze or glacier

57:54.920 --> 57:58.720
storage right and that's another tier in this whole thing with like our clone or

57:58.720 --> 58:03.840
similar or even a USB like a large USB just like Alex Alex sent me a link this

58:03.840 --> 58:13.720
morning for a 12 terabyte external USB disk for 175 bucks I mean that's not bad

58:13.720 --> 58:17.440
for 12 terabytes yeah and you you wouldn't want to run you would want to

58:17.440 --> 58:23.220
be streaming all of your Plex videos or MB videos or jelly thin but you would

58:23.220 --> 58:27.840
definitely maybe be okay with things you haven't accessed in two years or

58:27.840 --> 58:30.880
something being migrated off to USB storage that seems totally fine to me

58:30.880 --> 58:33.800
especially if it's just doing it on the back end when my system isn't super

58:33.800 --> 58:36.960
busy or on schedule times there's if you're on fedora you can basically just

58:36.960 --> 58:39.980
DNF install this sucker otherwise you're gonna have to do some building but when

58:39.980 --> 58:43.800
it comes installed when you install it it includes a system be unit file so you

58:43.800 --> 58:48.080
can set up to run automatically or you can just run the auto to your command

58:48.080 --> 58:51.840
and do what like a one-shot spread things out so you could just do it from

58:51.840 --> 58:54.400
time to time if you prefer to do it and more hands-on and I'll have it automated

58:54.400 --> 58:57.880
or you could schedule it to run automatically and just you take

58:57.880 --> 59:01.840
advantage of the system D service that's so cool it is really cool West it's I

59:01.840 --> 59:05.920
kind of wish I kind of wish it was built into the OS I kind of you know like

59:05.920 --> 59:12.000
using fuse next layer yeah wouldn't it wouldn't it also a bonus pick because we

59:12.000 --> 59:16.080
love the folks at antenna pod the free Android podcasting app has released a

59:16.080 --> 59:22.020
brand new version version 2.01 with over 20 volunteers and I think the team's

59:22.020 --> 59:26.080
pretty proud of this release I think so yeah I think a new logo refreshed user

59:26.080 --> 59:32.160
interface hey here's a nerdy one for us support for chapter images yes there's

59:32.160 --> 59:36.360
only a couple of podcast players that have that right that's nice they also

59:36.360 --> 59:41.440
have included a new set of app shortcuts allow users to go directly to their QR

59:41.440 --> 59:44.840
episode from the home screen so tap it there and goes right to that so you can

59:44.840 --> 59:48.060
have a Linux unplugged icon on your desk or on your Android screen and just go

59:48.060 --> 59:52.440
right to it it's also available in 17 languages I just love that about antenna

59:52.440 --> 59:56.920
but you know it's so cool that we have such a nice mobile podcast client that's

59:56.920 --> 01:00:00.840
open source oh that is Sony you know this new logo came after a call to the

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:05.240
open source design community and they received 12 proposals of which two were

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:10.920
selected and then put to a public vote well over 6,000 users participated so

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:15.640
hey that's so cool good for them good for them yeah and we don't talk about

01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:18.720
antenna pot enough because it's just one of those apps that just works and you

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:21.800
don't really think about it but when you use some other podcast players you

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:25.440
realize it's got features the other ones don't is really yeah if you have you're

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:28.680
doing something slightly off the beaten path yeah it's the way to go and as

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:32.560
podcasters we really appreciate that also thank you to our core contributors

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:37.800
the members of this show that keep us independent forever and also get two

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:43.800
options a limited ad feed or or if you so crazy an extended live mix that is

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:48.480
pre-edit it is every flub every mistake but it's also what you get before and

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:51.720
after the show that never makes it into the final recording honestly sometimes

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:55.720
we cut topics too because we try to keep the show to a certain run length we're

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:58.080
not intentionally excluding that from the public release it's just a

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:02.360
production call and that stuff is also in the live release it's all there you

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:08.040
can become a member at unplugged core comm and we really appreciate it you're

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:11.760
making this show possible we'd love your feedback at Linux unplug

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:16.020
comm slash contact reading your emails and whatnot is a big part of the show

01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:19.640
you can get links to everything we kind of talked about or maybe implied we

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:24.240
talked about or thought we were gonna talk about at Linux unplug comm slash

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:28.240
three seven five and last but not least we'd love to have you join us live oh

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:31.520
please do it's a great experience you get to participate either in the chat

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:36.160
room or in the mumble room if you so are inclined and you can find the link at

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:40.420
Linux unplug comm for how to set up the mumble how to get in there and then

don't forget once you have it set up you can also participate in the love plug

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:49.400
every single Sunday it's like it's like just a great hangout and I haven't been

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:52.000
able to make it as much now I've been feeling sad cuz I've been doing Linux

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.880
action news but I can tell you there has been some great conversations you get

01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:59.080
great project ideas if you're stuck on something or if you're chewing on a

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:03.880
piece of hardware and now this Sunday you can also talk browsers and we will

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:08.520
be back next Tuesday noon Pacific 3 p.m. Eastern over at JB live TV get that

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:12.060
converted to Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar thank you to our mumble

01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:17.240
room thank you to our chat room thank you to you Wes well thank you to you

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:20.760
also thanks to everyone out there for listening and sharing the show with

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:25.160
somebody word-of-mouth is the number one way podcasts get marketed pretty much

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:28.960
nothing else works so if you know somebody who would like this show share

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:31.440
it with them thanks so much for turn this week's episode of the unplug

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:49.200
program we'll see you right back here next tues tues Tuesday

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:24.520
we have forever on Kota radio discussed the Oracle and Google lawsuit I want to

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:29.600
play this clip that I found for Kota radio it's it's Sun Microsystems from

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:35.920
1995 really just top of the world you know ZFS perhaps was a twinkle in their

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:41.120
eye and Java was gonna be this thing that took over the world and they're

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:45.840
actually very forward-looking considering how this how old this clip is

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:49.520
when you think about where the rest of the industry was it's great so I thought

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:54.600
this would be fun little post-show thing to listen to so check this out see how

01:03:54.600 --> 01:04:00.200
retro it is already oh yeah you know the first 25 years at Sun have been just

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:05.160
huge amounts of innovation we popularized TCP IP we stunned the world

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:09.920
with NFS we've delivered spark and Solaris and Java and all the other new

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:14.400
technologies that you've seen Sun deliver and we're on six billion devices

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:20.240
Sun started with a very simple idea which is to take open standards on the

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:23.960
software side and combine them with open standards on the hardware side which at

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:28.560
the time was apparently quite revolutionary and everybody liked it so

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:33.400
this whole notion of open systems really started with Sun Microsystems 25 years

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:38.600
ago early on in Sun's career long before I got here was a fundamental idea that

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:42.440
if you propagated a standard across the world literally shared it with the world

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:45.520
you would create for yourself more opportunity for yourself and for your

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:49.440
customers and all the developers who worked with both of you our whole

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:54.720
strategy of sharing open interfaces open source even open sourcing the hardware

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:58.400
is going to create just an explosion of technology I think what really sets Sun

01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:03.000
apart is the idea that we live so fully by the idea that you should share your

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.080
innovation with the world someone's really the first company to define open

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:09.760
standards and open systems in the computer area and I have every reason to

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:14.480
believe that that strategy will be very successful going forward

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:19.400
I'm not sure any companies ever had a tagline that has been as enduring and

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:24.840
as right on the button as the network is the computer

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:30.640
we try to identify one phrase that would really show what we were trying to do as

01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:35.800
a company which was to make the computer in the network in the single show from

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:40.640
each other it is all about giving people access from anywhere any device any time

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:50.400
to open and share technologies and innovation
