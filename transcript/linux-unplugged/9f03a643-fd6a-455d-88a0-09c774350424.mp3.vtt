WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.360
I don't love this like your discords out of date

00:03.360 --> 00:09.720
I won't I know that shit is and especially especially why so that hit me on arch

00:10.280 --> 00:11.480
And here's what happened

00:11.480 --> 00:16.720
I was I was on air and I asked the discord room a question and then

00:16.840 --> 00:21.800
Went down to my second desktop realized discord wasn't open which it normally is like oh crap well

00:21.800 --> 00:25.740
Let me just go launch that really quick. Oh nope. Sorry you must update well, okay

00:25.740 --> 00:30.800
It can't auto-update because I installed it using pac-man, so let me update it via the packer

00:31.680 --> 00:35.120
Yeah, and nope can't do because of course dependencies are missing well

00:35.120 --> 00:39.080
Let me install that dependency real quick nope can't do that because that conflicts is something else you have installed

00:39.240 --> 00:45.120
So here I am on air doing a show trying to get discord installed on arch, and I'm like

00:45.680 --> 00:47.680
Yeah, I'm gonna install solace hey

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Well speaking about the one on solace

00:51.000 --> 00:56.840
And we got basically a warning on reddit from someone who's like there's a new discord out the one that you have

00:57.000 --> 01:03.540
It's just stopped working. We're like wait. Well if you pull the Skype. Yeah, so you just can't get into any words all right

01:03.540 --> 01:07.680
Yeah, we'll go update it this needs libc++. Okay. Oh, we don't have that

01:08.480 --> 01:15.240
Which normally wouldn't be a problem, but libc++ is part of LLVM, and if you know anything about LLVM

01:15.240 --> 01:17.240
It takes hours to build

01:17.240 --> 01:22.840
Like it literally takes hours like you the way that we do the build it also has clang it has LLVM

01:23.280 --> 01:25.680
Now has a libc++ LLDB

01:26.480 --> 01:31.600
LLD all of that in a single tree, and it's also got to build it to 32-bit as well

01:32.840 --> 01:35.440
All because I was like yeah, we're gonna use libc++ now

01:35.640 --> 01:42.800
Why so just why the the quick fix on solace these days, which is a sudo snap install discord

01:42.800 --> 01:49.720
Oh, it is a snap. Yeah, very good. I should have done that on arch. We didn't have snap either

01:51.400 --> 01:59.040
We were screwed this is Linux unplugged episode 210 for August 15th 2017

01:59.040 --> 02:05.040
Oh

02:10.720 --> 02:17.320
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's literally reloading its Linux right before the show starts

02:17.320 --> 02:22.440
My name is Chris. My name is Wes and hello Beardsley welcome back. Hello guys

02:22.440 --> 02:25.240
We got a really good show lined up today

02:25.240 --> 02:29.280
We have of course a few things to follow up on from last week, but before I address those

02:30.000 --> 02:35.400
We've got to talk about a big birthday today. We got a big big birthday in the community

02:35.400 --> 02:37.680
We have not one not two

02:37.920 --> 02:44.760
But three awesome app picks for you guys in this week's episode just some really cool open source projects that need a little attention

02:44.840 --> 02:51.280
And then the Internet's buddy I key has stopped by the program today to chat about solace 3

02:51.280 --> 02:59.120
snap and flat pack support in solace and I might have a little thing or two to say about it as well

02:59.880 --> 03:05.480
Then we're gonna do a little follow-up on the slack wear challenge. It turns out it turns out

03:05.480 --> 03:09.600
I've been using slack wear a little more since the show and I have a couple of more things to say about it

03:09.600 --> 03:16.640
This is probably the point of which we should say this week. We decided we are going to we're gonna punt the gen 2 challenge

03:16.640 --> 03:21.280
Just because neither one of us felt like we spent enough time with it

03:21.280 --> 03:24.960
There's a lot there and I and and part of my part of my problems

03:24.960 --> 03:28.600
I kept using slack wear for a little while and then I'm doing good

03:28.600 --> 03:33.460
I was like, okay, I'm ready to I'm ready to just really get into gen 2 and then that son of a gun I key

03:34.480 --> 03:42.560
Hashtag blame. I key goes and releases a brand new version of solace. Oh, which I I immediately I immediately this morning

03:42.560 --> 03:48.080
I'm how down on all of your USB drives automatically. I have it right here on this thumb stick, right?

03:48.400 --> 03:51.920
That's the thumb stick right there and I I loaded it up on my main

03:52.680 --> 03:58.080
Airmaster machine that we use to send every every all the images and play all the clips and stuff out to the stream

03:58.120 --> 04:04.680
So I loaded solace 3 and I'll tell you about it why I decided to go with solace for my arch

04:04.880 --> 04:07.000
Replacement on this machine and all of that

04:07.000 --> 04:13.240
So I think we just have a ton of really good stuff to get into really excited about the community news the app picks and haven't wimpy

04:13.240 --> 04:19.040
Here and I key are both back. I can't wait to chat with those guys. So let's start right there time-appropriate greetings virtual lug

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
greetings

04:22.800 --> 04:27.480
Hello, it's good to see everybody. I guess it's probably pretty well known by now

04:27.480 --> 04:31.480
I sort of snuck up on me. But today is gnomes 20th

04:32.200 --> 04:33.520
birthday

04:33.520 --> 04:41.100
Happy frickin 20th birthday gnome. That's impressive. There have been 33 stable releases since gnome 1.0 in

04:41.560 --> 04:47.560
1999 god damn, I am old. Holy crap. You mean I was using Linux. I was using Linux before gnome

04:47.560 --> 04:50.640
I guess that's that's Wow, that really makes me feel old

04:50.640 --> 04:56.240
Anyways, 20 years 20 years of gnome is being celebrated right now and a website's been set up

04:56.240 --> 05:03.240
Happy birthday gnome org and they also have a handy donate to gnome button there and they have a timeline where the project really got

05:03.240 --> 05:10.120
Started in 1997 which is about when I started become a and they've got that handy-dandy gnome 1.0 virtual machine if you want to relive

05:10.120 --> 05:12.600
Yes, Lori. Look at this screenshot, too

05:13.280 --> 05:21.620
You know, I remember I remember thinking how badass it was that the icons and the menus had textures like the gnome foot and the toolbox

05:21.620 --> 05:24.300
They had like textured backgrounds. I thought that was so cool

05:24.300 --> 05:29.140
I

05:29.140 --> 05:34.660
Mean I would look just fine on your slack wear red Chris and isn't that isn't that don't they call that that?

05:35.060 --> 05:39.060
That theme on the control bars there. Don't they call that crux? Isn't that called?

05:39.060 --> 05:41.300
I mean, that's where that's what I think of when people say crux

05:41.700 --> 05:46.340
Anyways, they have a nice nice timeline at happy birthday gnome org

05:46.860 --> 05:52.700
So yeah, so what's interesting about that is there are other projects that I use today

05:52.700 --> 05:57.780
That are older than no like wine wine for example is older than gnome

05:57.780 --> 06:04.100
Isn't that something and of course Gwadek just wrapped up and you can find all of the videos from Gwadek up on YouTube

06:04.980 --> 06:09.180
there's probably a couple that would be worth watching probably a couple that aren't and I

06:10.220 --> 06:14.060
Don't know. It's just a it's kind of a big milestone. Of course today's the day. I also switched off no

06:17.420 --> 06:20.860
But I'm still using the hell out of GTK so there you go

06:20.860 --> 06:28.320
I also I just before we go any further wanted to say next week might be might be just in studio Bearden West

06:28.340 --> 06:30.340
I'm not sure everything should be fine

06:30.980 --> 06:35.740
But I am going down to that to the solar eclipse in Oregon and I'm starting to like a little bit

06:35.820 --> 06:41.440
Get worried about the amount of people that are going to that thing. Yeah, so it could be a different show next week

06:41.440 --> 06:42.240
I may be here

06:42.240 --> 06:47.420
I may not meet up comm slash Jupiter broadcasting if you're gonna get your butt out to the Eclipse in the Oregon area and want

06:47.420 --> 06:51.460
To meet up with us. That's that should be pretty good meet up comm slash Jupiter broadcasting

06:51.460 --> 06:53.460
And then if nothing else, I should make it back in time

06:54.060 --> 06:58.300
To the show, but what I'm worried about is because I'll be traveling

06:58.300 --> 07:03.220
I still might not really get enough time to fully deep dive into gentoo. Okay, so I'm like me

07:03.220 --> 07:07.860
No, I'm like worried that we might need to do a double punt which I feel bad about but at the same time like the audience

07:07.860 --> 07:09.860
Has been asking for a gentoo challenge

07:09.860 --> 07:15.700
So long deserves to be a good one right that's what I figure it's like if I so this week I ended up I ended

07:15.700 --> 07:19.060
Up playing around with slack wear and then jumped over to solace and like well, wait a minute

07:19.060 --> 07:21.980
I was supposed to I didn't really gentoo like I got gentoo started

07:21.980 --> 07:25.100
I got a machine cleared off and I got like that process all started

07:25.100 --> 07:29.300
But I didn't really go much further than just getting started. I'm like, well, I need to run it as a desktop

07:29.300 --> 07:31.980
No long compiles. Yeah, it's okay

07:33.300 --> 07:37.700
It's gonna take you about two weeks to compile Katie. I'm gonna put it

07:37.700 --> 07:42.580
I'm gonna put it on that $10,000 Dell laptop and I'm just gonna let that thing rip through the

07:45.300 --> 07:49.140
If it does half as good as it does as an encoding video, I think I think I'm gonna be fine

07:49.140 --> 07:55.220
So anyways, that'll be so that could be maybe we're gonna punt then the gentoo challenge for two weeks

07:55.300 --> 07:59.580
But then I was thinking that's not necessarily a hundred percent bad because that gives people time to try it out, too

07:59.580 --> 08:01.980
Yeah, like what do you think beer you want you want to do it?

08:01.980 --> 08:07.180
Yeah, I don't even in a little virtual machine I like using my

08:08.740 --> 08:11.620
I just asked to have a good laugh cuz I knew what you were gonna say

08:11.620 --> 08:14.240
I didn't even need to really ask I knew what the answer was

08:14.660 --> 08:17.200
Anybody in the mumble room want to do a gentoo challenge with us?

08:22.380 --> 08:24.380
Can I claim to be above it

08:25.740 --> 08:27.740
Everybody else is busy getting things done

08:27.740 --> 08:34.220
You bastard West you brought this upon us you brought this upon me you dirty dog you dirty dog

08:34.220 --> 08:40.380
You called me out it during the outro music of last week's episode. The music was already playing. I mean I had to say yes

08:41.540 --> 08:44.540
actually, it's kind of a good it's kind of a perfect timing to because

08:45.500 --> 08:48.180
it's gonna be in a way going back to my roots and

08:48.820 --> 08:53.400
That's kind of ideal when I'm sort of I'm distro shopping right now and right now

08:53.400 --> 08:59.540
I'm seriously considering leaving solace on the air master machine doesn't necessarily mean that's where I want to use like that's that

08:59.540 --> 09:04.380
LTS Ubuntu has been working great for that and this just it could work great for OBS. So

09:07.180 --> 09:10.260
Times they are a change. So yeah, happy birthday to gnome

09:10.380 --> 09:12.300
Sorry, you guys know gentoo challenge

09:12.300 --> 09:15.300
But we got plenty of other stuff to talk to with I key here and all of that

09:15.300 --> 09:20.940
Did you also see beard that there is a new release of OBS today OBS 20? I think it is came out today

09:20.940 --> 09:23.860
I just saw the download come. I just saw the update come down

09:24.380 --> 09:29.100
Yeah, it's OBS 20 just come down and one of the things they're adding is like a totally dynamic

09:30.980 --> 09:32.980
Re-shuffable UI

09:34.140 --> 09:39.660
It's just really it's really they're really that is an open source project that is getting it must be huge in the twitch

09:39.660 --> 09:44.900
Yeah, it's just getting huge. Yeah, it's like every point release adds like a bunch of useful new things

09:45.300 --> 09:48.820
yeah, and I was just looking again for a new webcam and

09:48.820 --> 09:55.740
Like a Logitech webcam and on the box now, they're listing OBS support. Oh, that's that's really cool

09:55.740 --> 09:59.940
That's big for the OBS project like Logitech's putting that on the box like so congrats to them

09:59.940 --> 10:01.500
So OBS 20 came out today

10:01.500 --> 10:06.540
Lots of new features if you're looking for a way to do a screen cap and live stream it or even just record it to

10:06.540 --> 10:09.540
A file and maybe also attach a mic into a voiceover the lower third

10:09.980 --> 10:12.780
You know if you just want to even produce an instructional video for work

10:12.820 --> 10:15.000
You could do it in real time and OBS

10:15.000 --> 10:19.680
Instead of instead of putting it together slowly in an editor just do it live

10:20.160 --> 10:22.280
Go through the process like say you're you know

10:22.280 --> 10:26.400
You want to you want to convey some to another another co-worker how to do something on a server?

10:26.480 --> 10:29.920
Just screen cap it with OBS and record the whole thing with attach your mic

10:29.920 --> 10:35.800
And then you have an mp4 file and give it to them and you don't have to use it to live stream your podcast network

10:35.800 --> 10:39.240
You can use it for all kinds of things. Yeah, that's a great point be the next big twitch streamer and

10:39.240 --> 10:46.840
And it's it's really gotten to be super competitive as somebody who's followed, you know these applications for years now and pay thousands and thousands

10:46.840 --> 10:48.840
And thousands of dollars into alternative software

10:49.920 --> 10:53.240
Wirecast um, I mean you can remember back when like you

10:53.680 --> 10:59.240
Couldn't quite switch yet. And now oh, yeah come so far and now here there with version 20. Yeah, we've come so far

10:59.240 --> 11:04.000
I'm so proud of them. So anyways, you can check that out too. So lots of good stuff, but we do have some apps

11:04.000 --> 11:06.080
I thought maybe we get into some of these so let's

11:06.080 --> 11:11.680
Let's take a moment to thank Linux Academy for sponsoring the program Linux Academy comm slash unplugged

11:11.680 --> 11:16.800
It's a platform to learn about Linux built by Linux enthusiasts and it's it really shines because it's all they do

11:16.800 --> 11:22.280
It's what they focus on is Linux and everything around it from the low-level stuff up to the big topic stuff

11:22.340 --> 11:24.340
They have all kinds of different courseware

11:24.680 --> 11:28.160
Depending on what you're going for if you want something that's self-paced and in-depth

11:28.160 --> 11:29.000
This is perfect

11:29.000 --> 11:32.280
If you want something that can automatically nudge you a little bit to meet your goals

11:32.280 --> 11:34.960
They've got that too. If you just want to get some certifications

11:34.960 --> 11:40.940
They have courses created specifically for that and check out this thing. They've recently posted. I don't know if you saw this Wes

11:42.040 --> 11:44.040
build your own

11:44.560 --> 11:50.120
Linux.com. Oh, it's a site that Linux Academy's put up. I don't know exactly when it's new to me

11:50.120 --> 11:57.240
so I think it's kind of new and it is a rundown of how to completely build Linux from scratch using just

11:58.120 --> 12:02.780
the tools that come with the operating system and it's just a

12:02.780 --> 12:07.140
Fantastic way to learn what all this stuff does how it's all put together

12:07.820 --> 12:11.260
It's just it's I mean, it's brilliant. You could go, you know, you could go

12:12.100 --> 12:16.780
Do Linux from scratch or got to Gentoo? That's also an extremely really educational process

12:16.780 --> 12:23.100
But the nice thing about this is that it's recent. It's up-to-date. It's well formatted. It's well written and it's extensive

12:23.340 --> 12:26.900
Yeah, it's long. It's you'll spend a while doing this

12:26.900 --> 12:31.460
Yeah, and they and they have it in they've broken it down into what our major sections

12:31.460 --> 12:34.420
So they have six major sections and then they have individual

12:35.060 --> 12:40.540
Like subcategories in there. This is really this is a massive post so you can find it at buildyourownlinux.com

12:40.540 --> 12:45.780
I mean these guys and cows are really really just intensely passionate about Linux

12:45.780 --> 12:48.500
That's why they started Linux Academy and you can sign up at linuxacademy.com

12:54.380 --> 12:58.020
Thank you everybody for visiting there even just go in there and read it more about Linux Academy

12:58.020 --> 13:01.580
You know, let's him know you heard about it here linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

13:04.380 --> 13:08.860
Everybody loves KDE connect even gnome users are cut KDE connect, right?

13:08.980 --> 13:15.700
So this is why I was kind of interested to see M connect integration and KDE connect integration for gnome shell V and extension. Ah

13:18.140 --> 13:21.500
Yes, very very good the KDE connect is a

13:22.140 --> 13:27.940
Great app met the developer just really smart guy and just a really handy application

13:27.940 --> 13:32.260
We just talked about it recently as a way to dictate text into your into your Linux box

13:32.260 --> 13:38.540
Of course, it allows file sharing notification sharing sending of text messages all other kinds of features

13:39.900 --> 13:42.220
like media playback control and whatnot and

13:42.940 --> 13:50.060
there is now an extension that takes all those features of KDE connect and builds them in in a real gnome like way and

13:51.060 --> 13:54.340
It it does all the other kind of stuff you'd expect like if you send files

13:54.340 --> 13:58.860
I'll use Nautilus to do the file transfers. It'll mount the share the phone in Nautilus and

13:59.500 --> 14:06.900
It can use if you have your online account connected to Google it can use your Google account contacts to autocomplete SMS messages

14:06.900 --> 14:12.380
This is so cool. This is a full-fledged KDE connect integration with gnome shell first. No musers

14:12.380 --> 14:15.380
Well, I'm you know musers going to have to try that

14:16.420 --> 14:20.380
I'll have a link in the show notes Wes if you would like to indulge you can check it out

14:20.380 --> 14:25.140
And then well now we're getting to some of these app picks here. So that was the first one now

14:25.140 --> 14:27.340
How about one for everybody Windows users?

14:29.660 --> 14:31.500
Well

14:31.500 --> 14:34.940
You gotta wait a little bit, but everybody else Linux and Mac users you're good

14:34.940 --> 14:38.420
You are good. If you would like to try out alacrity

14:39.340 --> 14:42.580
Alacrity Wes. It's got a powerful name alacrity

14:43.780 --> 14:47.700
It is it is the fastest terminal emulator in existence

14:47.700 --> 14:52.540
It uses all claim it uses the GPU for rendering and why wouldn't it Wes?

14:52.540 --> 14:55.820
I mean you're sitting there with your terminal just wasting your GPU away

14:56.180 --> 15:01.780
Why wouldn't it Wes so alacrity is everyone has videos to render Chris?

15:01.780 --> 15:06.900
They just want to use their GPUs for something. It makes sense. Yeah. Yeah, you got me just sitting there doing nothing

15:06.900 --> 15:10.780
It's a cross-platform. I suppose if you have the free stuff to it work. It's a cross-platform

15:11.820 --> 15:17.480
Terminal based on simplicity and performance you got all you got a leg out like a thousand lines of text scrolling across your screen

15:17.480 --> 15:20.140
leg no more my friends it

15:20.820 --> 15:28.580
It's also available for a solace users and Ubuntu arched fedora. So can I watch a movie in this terminal now?

15:30.900 --> 15:32.900
Wait now do you want it to be ASCII?

15:33.060 --> 15:34.260
No

15:34.260 --> 15:38.880
It's GPU accelerated. Why can't it paint an image over the terminal?

15:40.580 --> 15:45.660
Maybe you could submit a suggestion is a written in rust to kind of looks like yeah

15:45.660 --> 15:49.220
I believe in mention, you know what? You're right. I should always mention when it's right

15:49.220 --> 15:53.220
Should everything I don't know if you should but you see by default, but I oh really? Yeah

15:53.220 --> 16:00.460
Yeah, maybe I just love pushing buttons of rust lovers and if you sudo snap install alacrity dash dash edge

16:00.620 --> 16:02.440
You can install it

16:02.440 --> 16:08.420
Look at that fan to waste this thing has solace build instructions. Yeah, that's what I was interested before then

16:08.420 --> 16:11.980
But no tell me more isn't that something right there? Isn't that somehow?

16:11.980 --> 16:15.940
Yeah, they thought I mean, I knew it had to be roast because that first line. Mm-hmm

16:15.940 --> 16:20.580
They maybe maybe they just figure solace users are the type that might want a GPU

16:20.700 --> 16:24.740
Accelerated terminal because you know, that's gonna be triggering some some listeners out there what I'm sorry

16:24.740 --> 16:30.060
What a GPU accelerated terminal? What is it written in an electron? No, it's rust. Calm down

16:30.060 --> 16:32.060
Well, I might just have to package it

16:33.980 --> 16:38.620
Reading the the about here. It sounds like they're taking the the gnome approach of

16:39.540 --> 16:40.780
removing

16:40.780 --> 16:42.260
features though

16:42.260 --> 16:47.260
Because it says the simple tab goal means that it has no tabs. Yeah, and

16:48.140 --> 16:50.820
It doesn't have such niceties as like a GUI

16:51.380 --> 16:55.820
Configuration editor. Nope. Nope, it doesn't. However, it does have a nice yaml file

16:55.820 --> 17:00.920
It's easy to follow and with good saying defaults once your GPU accelerated

17:00.920 --> 17:05.580
Why would I want a GUI when I just use my super fast terminal to edit my text file configs?

17:06.020 --> 17:09.220
Yeah, I mean it's obvious. This is this is the way I mean

17:09.220 --> 17:16.340
Shh, why else this is alacrity and it's up on github if you'd like to check it out. I actually think it's

17:16.900 --> 17:20.240
It's kind of cool. It's kind of it's actually building it. Are you?

17:21.460 --> 17:24.020
Man, it's even available on BSD. Oh

17:25.240 --> 17:26.300
Really?

17:26.300 --> 17:30.100
Well, I mean they are dead west so they kind of put themselves in the crapper

17:30.100 --> 17:33.440
Anyway, I did I didn't know they had 3d acceleration on BSD now

17:33.440 --> 17:37.420
They must be doing that to the Linux emulation layer probably I would imagine I

17:37.420 --> 17:40.620
I was I was I

17:41.340 --> 17:43.620
Was just teasing BSD guys. You don't have to write me

17:43.620 --> 17:44.060
All right

17:44.060 --> 17:48.380
So that's alacrity and we'll have a link to that in the show notes and then are you ready for your third?

17:48.380 --> 17:51.860
Look how fast we're going through these you guys amazing. We are really doing a good clip

17:51.860 --> 17:55.980
You heard in the show out. So I was uh, I was I started a journey. I

17:56.860 --> 18:02.340
Mentioned I would mentioned I stuck around on slack where I was trying out trying out the plasma desktop. I was trying out

18:02.340 --> 18:08.740
I also tried installing the latest plasma desktop packages on arch before I reloaded air master from arch

18:10.180 --> 18:12.180
so then I've been thinking about

18:13.300 --> 18:19.220
What producer Michael has been saying to me for four months now is he talks about how he has a plasma desktop setup

18:19.220 --> 18:23.540
That's it's actually very kind of gnomish, but it it's plasma

18:23.540 --> 18:26.280
And so I was thinking about like toying with that idea

18:26.280 --> 18:31.780
Is that something I could really do is that something I could sit down and get a nice clean minimal plasma desktop

18:31.780 --> 18:38.860
But still have you know that the performance of kwin and the the the tools and of like I like ksnapshot a lot

18:39.620 --> 18:44.840
Console is one of my favorite terminals and you know like a lean kind of run and config. Yeah, so

18:45.740 --> 18:47.940
during this process which eventually

18:49.120 --> 18:53.620
Completely backfired on me, but we'll get to that in a moment. But during this process I landed on

18:54.340 --> 18:59.740
Latte doc now I have become a doc denier. I am a doc denier these days. I

18:59.740 --> 19:06.580
I I've got my gnome favorites, you know that come up and that's a doc I suppose but I'm just I'm overdocs

19:07.060 --> 19:09.560
They're an awkward use of screen real estate

19:09.980 --> 19:16.000
They they often are dumb like they hide even even even though they call them tele hide and stuff like that

19:16.000 --> 19:18.140
They hide when I don't want them to hide and you know

19:18.140 --> 19:24.380
They're just dumb and it's like we've kind of half all gravitated to just you could mash the super key and then you know

19:24.380 --> 19:30.780
Yeah application. Yeah, you know really these days I all what I wanted what I want is I want something that lists

19:30.780 --> 19:37.020
What my running applications are graphically and lets me click between them and I want something that kind of outlines what virtual desktops

19:37.020 --> 19:43.980
I have and bonus points if I can tell what applications are in those virtual desktops, and I really just need something that

19:44.700 --> 19:48.180
Stays out of my way because I'm not really using it to launch new applications

19:48.180 --> 19:51.620
I'm not even gonna probably except for a core set of applications

19:51.620 --> 19:56.420
I don't need anything even pinned in it because it like you said I searched I you know, just run it

19:56.780 --> 20:02.380
So anyways in this process, I came across latte doc and it's a doc based on plasma frameworks

20:02.740 --> 20:09.840
That is pretty nice. It is it's it's animated a little heavily for me by default, but you can turn that down and it has

20:10.060 --> 20:11.180
a

20:11.180 --> 20:17.260
Pretty good tweak system that lets you set things that you would normally want to set for a doc and a really smart intuitive

20:17.260 --> 20:19.260
Way like what what edge it's on

20:19.260 --> 20:25.540
How it behaves how you add separators it it was nice and you can right-click and you can lock things

20:25.540 --> 20:29.220
It it's not one of these docs that prevents you from getting to the action items of a doc

20:29.220 --> 20:30.620
So like if I right-click on Chrome

20:30.620 --> 20:35.820
I still see open new instance opening cognito window from the dock you can somehow put applets down there

20:35.820 --> 20:42.460
Although I didn't figure that out. It has really kind of a smooth feel to it. I was able to crash it a couple of times

20:43.380 --> 20:48.140
So I inevitably ended up to not to decide not to use it on my machine

20:48.140 --> 20:52.000
It's on the air, but I really felt like if I was gonna go back to a doc

20:52.900 --> 20:54.900
Latte doc would be the one

20:55.260 --> 21:00.100
It really felt like a it felt like a it wasn't like too compromised it but it wasn't

21:00.820 --> 21:03.500
Overly done. It wasn't it wasn't overly built

21:03.500 --> 21:07.060
It was just it was just really kind of smooth and straightforward

21:07.060 --> 21:12.260
It has a couple of really nice features in the version that just came out four days ago version 0.7

21:12.260 --> 21:16.380
Oh, it has a wayland support preview, which is probably a good direction to go

21:16.380 --> 21:21.200
It has a new layout editor, which I liked quite a bit. There is a new dynamic background

21:22.260 --> 21:25.700
option that dynamically switches when a window is maximized versus

21:26.180 --> 21:32.740
Windowed which just makes it look really nice. And that's pretty sounds like yeah, there's there's all little things. They've added that

21:32.740 --> 21:39.260
Oh, oh, oh, I should probably mention this because my favorite one an audio streams indicator is now built into the dock

21:39.260 --> 21:44.300
Oh, yes, you could increase decrease volume or even mute volume right from the top

21:44.300 --> 21:48.180
Yeah that I really appreciate it. Maybe ducks are making their way back

21:48.820 --> 21:53.140
That's latte doc latte doc for you plasma desktop users. I

21:53.980 --> 21:56.540
Think it's pretty good. And so I

21:57.380 --> 22:01.560
got plasma desktop install and I got it configured and I got a latte doc set up but

22:03.700 --> 22:05.300
You know

22:05.300 --> 22:08.040
It just doesn't it doesn't quite click with me

22:08.040 --> 22:10.400
It doesn't there's something about the cute

22:10.400 --> 22:16.520
applications the complicated aspect of them that a lot of the little tweaking that I was gonna have to do and I was doing this an

22:16.520 --> 22:18.120
hour before the show started

22:18.120 --> 22:20.120
Not in your tweekiest mood. I

22:21.280 --> 22:23.800
Yeah, yeah, I ended up I ended up

22:24.960 --> 22:28.640
deciding to just take the solace plunge and I

22:29.120 --> 22:36.320
I went and grabbed the budgie ISO and I etched that to a to a thumb drive put it in the machine installed it

22:36.320 --> 22:40.840
just just cleared out my old partitions and left my data partitions alone and

22:42.320 --> 22:46.920
Just went all-in on budgie right now. So we're set up. I'm on the live stream. I'm on Firefox 55, too

22:46.920 --> 22:49.520
So it's not only that I switched to solace, but I switched to Firefox

22:51.600 --> 22:53.900
Why would you want to stay still that's just no

22:54.120 --> 22:59.200
You know for me it was it was sort of the best of both worlds because I like the GTK applications

22:59.200 --> 23:04.880
I I am very familiar with gnome settings and those settings applets. So they for me

23:04.880 --> 23:07.320
It's just sort of a nice sort of familiarity

23:07.320 --> 23:11.720
I like the new art and and look that we're gonna talk about a little bit in the new version of soul

23:11.720 --> 23:14.320
So that's the other thing. Of course. It's a new release as well came out today

23:15.280 --> 23:19.120
So those all kind of played a role but for me what it finally was is it just seemed like

23:19.680 --> 23:22.200
Well, I'm gonna take a I'm gonna take a little bit of a gnome breather

23:23.360 --> 23:28.880
But this is a good stepping stone because it's it's all of the GTK apps that I know and love

23:29.160 --> 23:32.800
It's all of the themes and icon sets that I know and love comfortable with

23:32.800 --> 23:39.520
Yeah, super comfortable with the terminal comfortable with all that stuff. I'm I've even learned to use current Nautilus

23:40.000 --> 23:41.560
files

23:41.560 --> 23:47.560
But it's it's things like it's mutter and it seems like the the size of gnome shell and all of these things that I've just added

23:47.560 --> 23:50.140
To it over time. It's not even necessarily all gnomes fault

23:50.880 --> 23:57.320
and so but the budgie desktop was sort of this nice sort of stepping stone to not completely switching away from GTK, but

23:57.320 --> 24:03.280
Because sort of stepping away from some of the things have been causing me issues recently to wean you off of it

24:03.280 --> 24:08.280
Yeah, and so latte doc doesn't really have a spot on on a GTK desktop so much

24:08.280 --> 24:11.280
But if you were if I was gonna go to a plasma desktop

24:11.280 --> 24:15.840
I think I would I would consider replacing the main panel that the plasma desktop uses

24:16.440 --> 24:21.640
Yeah, but so we do need to talk about solace though. That's the way I think we have

24:21.640 --> 24:24.360
We've talked enough about community updates and app picks

24:24.360 --> 24:30.280
but if you want to see any of those things we talked about today, we have links in the show notes latte doc also kind of

24:30.280 --> 24:32.280
cool is one of those

24:32.920 --> 24:38.560
Useful plasma applications that you can actually just install from the from the plasma store quote-unquote

24:38.880 --> 24:41.360
And I and it's kind of sort of distro agnostic

24:41.360 --> 24:42.480
Which is which is pretty cool

24:42.480 --> 24:45.600
So you can just you don't necessarily have to go find the show notes

24:45.600 --> 24:50.440
You could just search around in the plasma desktop or whatever. They call it store and install it there

24:50.440 --> 24:57.200
How about that was that so easy? How's your build going? It's still building. Is it? Well, I think I'm installing

24:57.200 --> 25:01.400
I'm still a bunch of rust dependencies now. It's a wild ride

25:01.840 --> 25:06.520
Good good. Well, I'm glad see I got I have installs going in the background right now. You've got installs

25:06.520 --> 25:11.480
This is one of those episodes where we're all users. Damn it. Yeah, we're installing our software while we do the show today

25:12.040 --> 25:14.600
And y'all hey, that's what's part of the fun

25:14.600 --> 25:19.920
That's why we do it fresh open-source software right at our love. We love drunk on the power

25:19.920 --> 25:20.640
We love it

25:20.640 --> 25:26.480
and you know what there's more and more software coming and some of them are getting wrapped up now in these universal package formats and

25:27.760 --> 25:33.820
Aiki and the souls project just announced support for snaps along with flat packs which already existed

25:33.820 --> 25:38.440
But it's not just like baby support. It's full grown-up proper sandboxed support

25:38.440 --> 25:41.680
So we're gonna talk about that with him and we're gonna pick mr

25:41.680 --> 25:47.800
Whippers whimpers his brain as well because I believe there was a little cross collab involved to get some of that stuff working

25:47.800 --> 25:50.160
So I want to figure out what all of that was and get the scoop on that

25:50.160 --> 25:54.800
So let's take a moment and thank digital ocean digital ocean comm go over there

25:54.800 --> 26:00.400
Create your account and then use our promo code of ultimate power do unplugged do

26:01.160 --> 26:04.920
Unplugged one word will give you a ten dollar credit over that digital ocean comm now

26:04.920 --> 26:08.040
They got a five dollar rig five dollar rig for five dollars

26:08.040 --> 26:12.640
You could run that rig two months for free with our promo code do unplug cuz I got a five dollar rig

26:12.640 --> 26:19.600
That's nuts. I can't even get a burger for five dollars. I might be able to get the fish sandwich for five dollars

26:19.600 --> 26:21.600
But what you know you want to?

26:22.240 --> 26:26.640
Exactly, but you know what that five dollars much better spent over digital ocean premium

26:26.640 --> 26:33.120
You can spin up a droplet in less than 55 seconds all SSDs for the hard drives 40 gigabit connections coming to the hypervisor

26:33.120 --> 26:37.280
Linux for the server they have KVM for that hypervisor, which is brilliant

26:37.280 --> 26:38.440
They have a dashboard for days

26:38.440 --> 26:42.200
That's super easy to use they have an API that straightforward brilliant

26:42.200 --> 26:46.040
And it's so well developed that they use it themselves to build their own

26:46.320 --> 26:52.320
Systems on top of digital ocean then they have all kinds of really crazy advanced features like block storage

26:52.320 --> 26:54.760
And they're working on object storage right now

26:54.760 --> 27:00.600
They have firewalls that deploy at the network level so the traffic you want to reject never even reaches your system

27:00.600 --> 27:02.560
They have load balancing as a service

27:02.560 --> 27:08.320
Monitoring alerting where you get metrics and alerts when things go down and of course they have entire stacks of pre-built

27:08.920 --> 27:14.920
Open-source applications ready to go with a single click or you know you just build it from scratch yourself

27:14.920 --> 27:18.320
I was gonna say does that sound too easy. Don't worry. Just install free

27:19.760 --> 27:22.160
What you're doing and you'll have it

27:22.680 --> 27:26.040
Yeah, if you get stuck you just email those BSD now guys

27:26.280 --> 27:30.800
This is the way I go is when I'm just trying out something like either for the show

27:30.800 --> 27:36.640
Or I want to play with something or a new release of a distro comes out that I want to throw on a server

27:36.840 --> 27:44.800
They have a three cents an hour machine three cents an hour machine easy to justify that is that is and then find some

27:44.800 --> 27:47.720
Spare change in your couch. Yeah, throw it on the floor well deal unplugged

27:47.720 --> 27:51.160
Yeah, you get the $10 credit you could run that three cents an hour you get that for quite a while

27:51.160 --> 27:55.240
And you know you could you could destroy and create a couple of machines in that time. It's great

27:55.240 --> 27:57.880
It's just so much fun to play around with to or to put it in production

27:57.880 --> 28:03.040
They got data centers all over the world so you get something nice and fast wherever you your users are at

28:03.560 --> 28:06.760
DigitalOcean.com use the promo code do unplugged big

28:06.760 --> 28:11.920
Thank you digital ocean also while you're over there go over to their community section and look at the open source projects

28:12.000 --> 28:16.400
Built around digital ocean digital ocean calm use the promo code do unplug

28:17.720 --> 28:21.700
So I key welcome back to the show sir it is really good to talk to you

28:21.700 --> 28:25.440
And I don't think you've been on the show since you've gone full-time either although

28:25.440 --> 28:30.720
We talked right before you did go full-time, but congrats on the transition. It looks like time has been well spent

28:34.720 --> 28:35.720
Congratulations

28:35.720 --> 28:39.920
Solus 3 is out, and I got it loaded right here on my machine

28:39.920 --> 28:45.120
And we look it is looking really great, so I I guess let's start there cuz that's like the big

28:45.120 --> 28:51.080
That's like the big story. I noticed that you got Firefox 55 in the sucker and man is that fast, but

28:51.080 --> 28:55.920
I didn't realize this before and I guess last time I tried souls

28:55.920 --> 29:01.800
I just maybe didn't notice or I forgot but Solus 3 is using the Linux LTS kernel and

29:02.440 --> 29:07.360
That was actually what pushed me over the edge because I've been thinking more and more about using

29:07.920 --> 29:11.140
LTS core stuff for our production machines

29:11.140 --> 29:15.760
but having faster moving applications like Chrome and OBS and

29:15.760 --> 29:20.840
So when I saw the fact that I could pin it to LTS, which is the default

29:20.840 --> 29:25.040
I could use current, but it was it was pinned to LTS. It's default on the existing ones

29:25.640 --> 29:30.000
So so in the new ones it's so we have two kernel branches

29:30.000 --> 29:32.660
I mean back in the old days pre-clear bit manager

29:32.840 --> 29:37.560
We just had one kernel and it sucked and if you updated you were screwed

29:37.880 --> 29:41.960
And then we spent ages. I mean basically it updated the same way as our trying

29:41.960 --> 29:45.700
We know how that goes. My modules are gone. It was that same story

29:45.700 --> 29:51.480
But nowadays we have the next current Linux LTS the next LTS basically follows a great branch

29:53.000 --> 29:58.000
So that's gonna update again in September to 4.14 and then it's gonna stay on that for a long time

29:58.000 --> 29:59.860
Yeah, and then it'll update again

29:59.860 --> 30:03.820
So users can now freely have them both installed and then they can go between them

30:03.960 --> 30:09.140
We've got all the Nvidia drivers for both of them as well. So you can quite happily you don't have to build them

30:09.140 --> 30:11.140
There's no DKMS none of this

30:11.140 --> 30:16.100
You know pixie blood crap, dude. You haven't got to go through that so you can just pick every one of them

30:16.100 --> 30:20.260
This new ISO is defaulting to the Linux current branch

30:20.660 --> 30:24.840
Which is basically the stable kernel most of the time, right?

30:25.380 --> 30:30.020
But there might be times when we say and we don't want to update it. So we're not gonna call it Linux

30:30.020 --> 30:35.400
So are you saying with clear root manager you made the switch from shipping LTS is default to shipping current is default

30:36.820 --> 30:38.620
No

30:38.620 --> 30:43.020
Yes, I know so the the ISO itself is now using the Linux current package

30:43.100 --> 30:45.900
Which means it's on four point twelve point seven, right?

30:45.900 --> 30:50.500
But because we now use clear boot manager you can use either we can have any current

30:51.020 --> 30:56.460
What I opted to do which I think is great because and then all the envy of the you have the appropriate Nvidia packages to

30:56.460 --> 30:58.900
Match up. So it was just really easy. Yeah, it was really straightforward

30:59.740 --> 31:03.820
Nice, so okay. So I just that was something I really like okay now, you know what?

31:03.820 --> 31:05.820
I'm gonna do the LTS kernel. I'm gonna go with that

31:05.820 --> 31:11.980
So let's talk about some of the stuff that's in that kernel that that made snap packages possible

31:11.980 --> 31:12.500
Let's start there

31:12.500 --> 31:17.620
Maybe because I think didn't you have to make some pretty low-level changes for the sandboxing support must have required at least app armor

31:18.420 --> 31:25.360
Yeah, so that basically there are there are app armor patches that have gone up for four point thirteen and four point fourteen

31:25.900 --> 31:29.460
The canonical guys are very diligent in getting all that stuff upstream

31:29.460 --> 31:34.340
But you know that that stuff does take time a fair amount of it has gone upstream

31:34.340 --> 31:39.220
But it's it's not all there. So for the two kernels, I've back parted from

31:40.340 --> 31:46.500
Zesty and artful. I've basically back parted their implementations of app armor, which are the future upstream ones

31:46.900 --> 31:53.500
Which means that solace is now using the exact same implementation of app armor that a bunch of is using that's bad

31:53.500 --> 31:58.980
Which also means that we're the only over dish at the time of saying this

31:58.980 --> 32:06.840
I want to be very specific about that at the time of saying this we're the only non-abundant to the next distribution to have

32:06.900 --> 32:08.900
full snap confinement

32:09.460 --> 32:15.620
Like as a like for like with a bun too, right? That's awesome. Well, there'd be a nine has it as well

32:16.420 --> 32:18.420
Well shipped

32:21.620 --> 32:23.620
How did this come about so

32:23.620 --> 32:28.820
Um, okay. Well, it's his fault. Well, I thought so but I mean you're also

32:30.060 --> 32:33.900
You have your position has evolved on this but for some people listening to this show though

32:33.900 --> 32:36.900
They'll remember you as the anti flat pack anti snap guy

32:38.380 --> 32:40.260
Yeah, I mean

32:40.260 --> 32:44.660
I'm you know, like a whole thing about having the angel and devil in your ears, right? Sure

32:45.540 --> 32:52.420
Wimpy has become the the angel in the air and I've got about four of my own devils in here the whole time, but

32:52.420 --> 32:54.620
When we first decided on it

32:54.620 --> 32:54.860
I mean

32:54.860 --> 33:00.700
it was it was a long time ago when the whole debate started coming about and it took a long time for facts to

33:00.700 --> 33:06.260
Change and facts have changed, you know, and there's certain things would have accelerated it, you know

33:06.260 --> 33:10.140
But now snap is looking to be the agnostic agnostic platform that everyone

33:10.700 --> 33:15.820
Needs to support now from the solos perspective when we first went for a flat pack

33:15.820 --> 33:23.300
It was basically replaced the aging crappy third party, which you had the pleasure of enjoying recently

33:23.300 --> 33:30.100
Yeah, that is a bit of a it is a bit of an uncomfortable. It sucks. It sucks. So you want something that you know

33:30.780 --> 33:35.580
Something just works for the users, you know, like minimal friction and when we first said, oh, you know

33:35.580 --> 33:37.360
We're gonna go for flat back

33:37.360 --> 33:44.540
It was we wanted the least invasive change and I guess it was basically bang for buck at the time with least amount of

33:44.540 --> 33:48.580
You're essentially getting it with GTK to

33:49.620 --> 33:54.140
Known world, wasn't it? You know, you bring in OS tree. Well that depends on GLib world

33:54.140 --> 33:59.060
We have all this stuff, you know, that would have been easy enough and it's a C known library essentially

33:59.180 --> 34:04.420
But I mean since that time and it's got to be six plus months eight months or something like that now

34:04.820 --> 34:11.560
It's it's changed a lot and then nowadays flat pack is more about these runtimes very much about these runtimes

34:11.560 --> 34:16.260
But as a vendor, I mean, we're effectively an OS V. We have no say

34:16.980 --> 34:21.020
We have no influence there and there are times when we're gonna want to add value

34:21.500 --> 34:26.700
So you can imagine to draw a parallel if you're a Samsung and you're manufacturing Chromebooks

34:26.700 --> 34:29.860
You're gonna want to add value on for your customers, right?

34:29.860 --> 34:35.260
You're gonna want that value at not just shipping that we want the opportunity of we're doing things with third-party

34:35.620 --> 34:37.620
applications to actually enhance that and

34:37.620 --> 34:41.820
Do cool things today with the solace room. I want to pause you there. So because I think that

34:42.220 --> 34:46.940
Comparison will probably make a lot of people sort of wretch a little bit because it sounds

34:47.860 --> 34:49.860
Value add right? Yeah, right

34:50.280 --> 34:55.800
What about using discord as an example there because I think discord is an example where a lot of distributions sort of just got

34:55.800 --> 35:01.540
Screwed a little bit. Mm-hmm. And I think I think if you are like this is what I was thinking

35:01.540 --> 35:06.300
I key is the thing about solace is you guys are really on top of packaging when you do decide to package something like you

35:06.300 --> 35:11.500
Really think it through and it's you commit to it. So discord was pretty quickly fixed and

35:12.340 --> 35:14.780
There was a dependency that discord all of a sudden required

35:14.780 --> 35:17.760
And of course it also required to be running on a current version

35:17.760 --> 35:19.800
This is you know, this is the way these things go

35:19.800 --> 35:24.080
especially new applications, especially for vendors that are still learning how to support Linux and

35:24.980 --> 35:31.140
In my experience solace handled that pretty much the best and was able to get the additional dependencies

35:31.140 --> 35:36.200
Bundled in there and shipped and pushed down to the end-users and fix the problem pretty quickly, but

35:37.020 --> 35:42.200
It does kind of raise the argument for I mean there is the whole thing if you're an application developer

35:42.200 --> 35:44.680
I mean, we all like to give them a lot of problems, you know

35:44.680 --> 35:50.320
Like they're not bringing this stuff over to Linux, but there is the whole part of which Linux do you target?

35:50.320 --> 35:53.560
It's like the joke I made about solace. Which arm would we target?

35:53.580 --> 35:56.480
Well, it's kind of the same for which Linux would you go for so?

35:56.480 --> 36:03.260
You given them a common target that they can all go for that just happens to run on all the Linux distributions

36:03.260 --> 36:04.180
It makes a lot of sense

36:04.180 --> 36:10.420
So I'm not interested in in terms so much of the open-source software because well you can distribute that anyway

36:10.420 --> 36:15.300
Sure, but stuff that we can't distribute and to give an example I can now

36:15.940 --> 36:22.060
Well bad example, but I can run next cloud on my local box for testing for snap. That's all fully managed

36:22.060 --> 36:24.100
That's not something we're ever gonna package in solace

36:24.100 --> 36:28.380
How would it change in Chrome like if there was an official Google Chrome snap or flat pack?

36:28.380 --> 36:31.900
How would that change distributing that for you? So I mean it comes straight from the vendor

36:32.280 --> 36:37.440
Which is a great thing and in many ways snap operates a little bit like a package manager

36:37.440 --> 36:43.380
Anyway, in terms of there are indexes and there are updates and there are these blobs that it goes to fetch when we do it

36:43.380 --> 36:49.360
Now we've got to go to our third-party repo and effectively mark the new URL for the original deb file

36:49.360 --> 36:55.500
And then put the hash in there. That's you know, we basically some said I try to install Chrome it failed

36:56.380 --> 37:00.900
That's how we know that sucks. Yeah, I mean I really really suck. So there's no update

37:00.900 --> 37:07.700
There's no automatic update for snap kind of takes that away in the the software vendors can be responsible

37:07.700 --> 37:12.060
I mean regardless of the application they can be responsible for when their stuff goes out

37:12.340 --> 37:18.420
They can test it themselves before it actually gets to the distributions and there are built-in update mechanisms as well

37:18.420 --> 37:22.740
So being able to swap out the hacky I was tracking it stuff versus

37:23.060 --> 37:26.660
These vendors would want to put out their own software and say well

37:26.660 --> 37:30.300
This is what you're getting then it takes the pressure off of everyone in that circle

37:30.300 --> 37:36.460
So what going back to flat pack and snap one of the things that does sort of stand out is it sounds like to do

37:36.660 --> 37:41.100
full-fledged proper big boy matching Ubuntu snap support

37:41.180 --> 37:47.000
It was a bit more work than flat pack because you just sort of you sort of just got flat pack

37:47.000 --> 37:51.400
Reflecting on that did did snaps

37:52.720 --> 37:58.320
Focus on not just desktop, but also including server software. Was that a motivating factor here?

37:58.320 --> 38:03.280
Because well traditionally that'd be a weaker area for solace, right? So if snap, yeah, we're desktop

38:03.280 --> 38:06.040
yeah, but this could sort of fill in gaps that

38:06.880 --> 38:09.080
Solace has right now that you know

38:09.080 --> 38:14.440
If some user wanted to run say sab NZB on their solar system, and there's a snap for that

38:14.440 --> 38:16.440
I

38:19.200 --> 38:21.200
Mean a lot of it's Martin's fault

38:22.920 --> 38:26.200
I mean there's stuff that we can't distribute but not only that

38:26.200 --> 38:31.440
There's stuff that we won't distribute and that was the angle that Martin was taking this like

38:31.600 --> 38:37.480
There's gonna be stuff that your inclusion policy is just not gonna go for but some people are gonna need and from the solace

38:37.480 --> 38:42.360
Perspective, it's sometimes it's gonna be a bit like a get out of jail free card instead of just saying to people

38:42.360 --> 38:45.520
No, no, we're not putting this in and then everyone's unhappy

38:45.520 --> 38:50.520
it's like however, you know, there is this over approach that you can go that you can go the snap route and

38:50.880 --> 38:53.400
the the other part of it is that basically

38:54.080 --> 38:56.760
the the snap craft and the Ubuntu teams have

38:57.160 --> 39:03.220
Very much been there over the last few days and I think we started on something like the Thursday or Friday or something like that

39:03.480 --> 39:06.360
But in the end we wanted the first day I got back from holiday

39:06.360 --> 39:13.040
Yeah, and it was like two days later. We got to the point where we actually had the first kernel patched

39:13.400 --> 39:18.440
So it was the next current kernel and we had the full confinement and on the next morning

39:18.560 --> 39:21.520
We then had compatibility with classic confinement as well

39:22.400 --> 39:24.400
What is so without that help?

39:25.120 --> 39:28.520
When be can you explain the difference between confinement and classic confinement?

39:29.520 --> 39:32.600
Okay, so there's three confinement models

39:32.600 --> 39:39.760
now there's dev mode which is what you start with when you're creating your snap at the beginning and that tears down much of the

39:40.040 --> 39:46.760
Confinement and then when you actually want to publish your snap, you've got two confinement options. There's strict confinement

39:47.040 --> 39:53.840
Which means the application is entirely sandboxed and only has access to the things that you define

39:54.360 --> 39:59.880
Via the snap craft yaml. So think of it like a firewall. You've got this application in a sandbox

39:59.880 --> 40:03.360
This application needs access to your webcam

40:03.480 --> 40:07.640
so in the yaml you tell it it can access the webcam and there are

40:08.120 --> 40:14.560
Dozens of interfaces to give applications discrete access to different things on the host operating system

40:15.800 --> 40:17.800
usually hardware devices

40:18.960 --> 40:23.840
And so when it's strictly confined it can only access those things that you've prescribed it can access

40:23.840 --> 40:31.680
and it can also only access files within its snap or if you add a home interface to a

40:32.360 --> 40:38.320
Sandboxed portion of your home directory. So even if you have the home interface enabled you can't see

40:39.080 --> 40:41.080
files and dot folders

40:41.360 --> 40:46.840
From the snap and that's to prevent the snap being used to maliciously get it, you know

40:47.240 --> 40:49.240
GPG keys and things of that nature

40:49.520 --> 40:52.760
so so what was so what was required sort of

40:52.760 --> 40:57.920
On a back end. What is missing? What is missing it for Linux distributions to support this?

40:59.160 --> 41:02.120
Well to support what exactly this confinement

41:03.640 --> 41:04.960
Well

41:04.960 --> 41:10.600
That you need a palmer basically. That's sort of the more controversial thing about this

41:10.600 --> 41:16.520
Is that some people don't want to roll out so much? I mean openSUSE are using app armor

41:16.520 --> 41:21.240
Yeah, I keep us in the position where he hadn't chosen an LSM at this point

41:21.240 --> 41:23.240
So I see Linux

41:26.280 --> 41:28.280
What then I say they make great software

41:30.240 --> 41:34.560
But some part of the problem is that classic confinement is

41:35.600 --> 41:36.760
basically

41:36.760 --> 41:41.480
Allowing a snap to run pretty much without any confinement whatsoever

41:41.920 --> 41:46.980
So there are specific use cases for classic confinement. So for example

41:46.980 --> 41:54.380
a liquidity that we mentioned earlier is a classic snap because it's a terminal and it needs to execute

41:54.780 --> 42:00.220
Shell commands from arbitrary locations on your hard drive. So that means no confinement has

42:00.780 --> 42:01.900
So well

42:01.900 --> 42:08.040
It has to have no confinement over what it can see on your hard disk because it has to be able to execute arbitrary things

42:09.100 --> 42:10.780
And compilers, you know

42:10.780 --> 42:16.740
If you want to snap a language or a compiler that almost certainly has to be classic for the same reasons. So

42:18.060 --> 42:21.900
But then the the trick here is the way that snapd works is that

42:22.500 --> 42:25.320
snaps and everything to do with snap sit under

42:25.940 --> 42:29.020
snap in the root of the file system and

42:30.140 --> 42:31.220
some

42:31.220 --> 42:34.920
distros have elected to not follow that

42:36.020 --> 42:37.660
requirement and

42:37.660 --> 42:44.820
Relocate snaps elsewhere on the file system and at that point it breaks the opportunity to run classic snaps at all

42:46.300 --> 42:53.660
Okay, so this to me to me it seems like it's maybe just a little it's it's a little bit

42:54.380 --> 42:58.860
It's a little confusing because there's a lot. There's a lot of parts there, but it sounds like pretty simply

42:59.460 --> 43:02.100
Simply put if it's done if it's done properly

43:02.100 --> 43:07.700
You can have you could still have a you can have a system that fully fully supports confined snaps

43:07.900 --> 43:12.440
But the snap if set up could not be confined

43:14.060 --> 43:18.220
Yes, okay, I think I got it. Okay interesting. So what was behind the scenes?

43:18.220 --> 43:22.220
What was the work between say yourself and I key to get this working on solace?

43:22.940 --> 43:27.860
Well, I am I've really been a glorified cheerleader in this whole process

43:27.860 --> 43:34.780
And a go-between so I think I heard I key say on

43:36.300 --> 43:40.360
Late night Linux a few weeks ago that he was open to

43:42.760 --> 43:45.460
Using snaps and my ears pricked up and I thought

43:47.700 --> 43:50.420
So I immediately got on telegram

43:50.420 --> 43:57.220
And we started to have a conversation and then I

43:57.780 --> 44:05.220
Had a chat with some of the guys at work and we identified a few people who would have some time to assist and

44:05.780 --> 44:07.780
We waited for I key to

44:08.940 --> 44:12.460
Make his transition to working on solace as his full-time

44:14.020 --> 44:19.880
Endeavor and then I key got busy doing his release business and then last week

44:19.880 --> 44:24.220
We made the introductions with I key and the other guys in the team

44:24.220 --> 44:30.080
And I was basically just standing on the sidelines applauding and cheering enthusiastically at that point. I

44:31.020 --> 44:33.020
Loved how it came out I key, you know

44:34.220 --> 44:39.620
Starts with that it started the Google plus post and I just sit there and I go this this son of a bitch

44:42.300 --> 44:47.420
Well, I did drop hints to it on the last time I was sort of dropped hints that it yeah

44:47.420 --> 44:53.300
It was sort of in the back of my head. But yeah, well, I've a habit of doing this as an end user now

44:53.660 --> 44:58.840
Is there really anything I do? Do I just snap a snap installed on the you have a stop installed already? Yeah

44:58.840 --> 45:05.640
Okay. Well, there you go. So you can just do pseudo snap installed brave dash dash beta. Oh brave really?

45:05.980 --> 45:12.780
Yeah, so we wasn't really looking forward to packaging brave results. It's another thing. It's electronic

45:12.860 --> 45:15.740
So the syntax is pseudo snap installed

45:15.740 --> 45:22.060
Mm-hmm. Yeah, brave brave and then dash beta dash dash. It's a dash. Yeah, that's right

45:23.380 --> 45:25.380
I'm a noob

45:26.060 --> 45:28.060
Sold a couple of snaps, but not many

45:28.460 --> 45:33.180
There we go. It's downloading right now. It's a good example because it's fully confined. Oh

45:33.980 --> 45:37.020
And it will also use the open GL interface as well

45:37.420 --> 45:41.500
Which means that we've actually got a couple of fixes going in at the moment now

45:41.500 --> 45:47.180
We're going back and forth from the polar crates but some of the stuff like the way that we have the open gel libraries on

45:47.180 --> 45:50.760
Solos is laid out basically the same as they would be on arts Linux

45:51.100 --> 45:54.620
So the stuff that we're doing now because we have the full confinement

45:54.740 --> 45:59.260
We're finding books that arts Linux will have by the time it gets full confinement

45:59.500 --> 46:03.260
So we're fixing their books before they happen, which is kind of cool

46:04.260 --> 46:07.020
Yeah, this is another advantage of getting

46:07.020 --> 46:13.640
What is probably and I mean this with love I keep the most foreign Linux distribution

46:13.780 --> 46:18.500
Yeah running snaps because you're you are trailblazing in many ways

46:18.980 --> 46:26.020
It's a very opinionated Linux. Yeah, you're going to bump into things. Yeah, well it will it show up now in my

46:26.820 --> 46:31.500
How does that show up in your menu does it now fight, but I do brave. I see nothing. I see nothing

46:31.500 --> 46:38.060
I see nothing, but if I can if budgie menu is being an idiot, then you can use another feature of budgie all an f2. Oh

46:39.180 --> 46:40.580
alt

46:40.580 --> 46:41.940
f2

46:41.940 --> 46:46.980
Aha, I see. Yes. I need to learn that that's gonna be my new favorite feature. I do need that

46:46.980 --> 46:50.500
That's Brian from the solos team told me that I had to tell you that

46:51.540 --> 46:56.020
So I've been looking to slip that one in that is really good. I really do like that. All right, so I'm waiting

46:56.020 --> 46:58.700
I'm waiting. I'm not seeing all so it's alt f2. Oh, there we go

46:58.700 --> 47:03.780
Yeah, just type in brave and it should be there. Yeah, it just it just it just popped up

47:04.180 --> 47:07.780
Yeah, the first time you launch any snap it takes slightly longer

47:08.660 --> 47:12.300
Because it's setting everything up in the back end, you know, like for the next time it runs

47:12.300 --> 47:19.180
It's got all these policies and everything. But the next time you run it should basically be instant. Yeah, and that that first run

47:20.300 --> 47:23.740
Latency is something we're addressing as well. So that will go away in time

47:23.740 --> 47:29.340
What a perfect way to play with something like brave this is because you just if you have snap support

47:29.340 --> 47:32.980
you can you can do that same command and you can be messing around with it and it's

47:33.580 --> 47:37.940
This is this is probably you know, a browser is a perfect example of an application

47:37.940 --> 47:40.060
That should be you can test the sandbox in though

47:40.220 --> 47:45.360
So if you go on right click on something and was to do like a save as to get the file dialog pop up

47:45.540 --> 47:48.920
Try navigating to one of the folders that you're not allowed to go to

47:48.920 --> 47:54.600
So like your root folder or back into your real home folder. Sure. So we'll go let's try going to

47:57.160 --> 47:59.280
Other locations computer. Oh

48:00.880 --> 48:03.860
Yeah, no, it's basically this is screw you you can't go there

48:04.880 --> 48:06.560
interesting

48:06.560 --> 48:09.760
Interesting. In fact, yeah now this is this is an interesting

48:10.400 --> 48:15.520
Notion this sandboxing of browsers because if you've ever run s trace whilst

48:15.520 --> 48:19.920
You have what if you've had you got

48:20.440 --> 48:26.960
Firefox installed and you start Chrome for the first time and you have s trace on the Chrome process

48:27.160 --> 48:34.340
You will see Chrome going grubbing around all over Firefox looking for stuff really and if they

48:35.040 --> 48:38.680
Know if you've got these in set each of them as sandboxed

48:39.080 --> 48:44.920
Snaps, then you can't have that happen. So I know if you're that's interesting

48:44.920 --> 48:46.920
Sorry to interrupt. I noticed though. So

48:48.000 --> 48:51.160
What about theming support guys? What is the what is the story there?

48:51.160 --> 48:53.920
I went finish your thought if you were if you're gonna finish something

48:53.920 --> 48:56.960
But just after you do finish it, I'd be curious to know what the what the story is with theming

48:57.440 --> 49:03.780
No, no, I've made my point about you know stopping applications from you know snooping on that is really nice. Yeah

49:04.640 --> 49:09.240
But in terms of theme support that was something so a few weeks ago

49:09.240 --> 49:15.080
we had a sprint in London a snap sprint in London and there a number of people from the

49:15.680 --> 49:19.480
community invited to that from you know, KDE and elementary and

49:20.680 --> 49:24.040
gnome and all sorts and one of the

49:25.880 --> 49:31.520
Tracks we did there was how we're going to improve the theme support and that's currently being worked on

49:31.520 --> 49:36.680
So we did the design there and that's that's in progress seems like a challenge

49:36.680 --> 49:40.680
That seems like a real challenge if it's supposed to be isolated and all of that. I mean that seems yeah

49:40.680 --> 49:46.980
There's there's a number of cool new bits of tech coming to make all of this magic happen

49:47.080 --> 49:49.080
But we fleshed out how to handle

49:49.760 --> 49:52.960
themes fonts and icons in a way that you can

49:53.680 --> 49:55.680
Interconnect them and what?

49:56.160 --> 49:57.600
and

49:57.600 --> 50:02.560
So something that I can I've discussed and so what you need to know is I key knows things

50:02.560 --> 50:09.720
He can't talk about at the moment and I heard him so hard podcast a couple of days ago

50:09.720 --> 50:14.720
And I could tell that I key wasn't sure if this thing that he knew he could talk about or not

50:14.720 --> 50:19.440
No, as it happens he can so I key was interviewed on oven to fun

50:20.160 --> 50:26.780
Podcast which is a German language podcast, but fortunately I key was interviewed in English, which I can just about hope with

50:26.780 --> 50:34.180
Yes, and one of the things that I key was alluding to is just talking about how solace could add value to the snap

50:34.580 --> 50:35.940
ecosystem

50:35.940 --> 50:39.980
And he wasn't able to articulate what he meant exactly and I'll explain

50:40.220 --> 50:48.700
so at the moment when you install a snap for the first time a core snap gets installed and that core snap is a

50:48.700 --> 50:56.180
Very thin Ubuntu runtime so a very small shim of user space

50:56.620 --> 50:58.880
Which also has snap D

50:59.740 --> 51:07.060
Embedded inside it. So when you're running brave at the moment, you actually have this very thin Ubuntu

51:07.500 --> 51:14.500
Layer and then the snap sits on top of that. So effectively it's an Ubuntu runtime that you're using

51:15.260 --> 51:16.500
alongside

51:16.500 --> 51:17.700
solace

51:17.700 --> 51:22.680
But what we're doing is we're going to introduce this concept of base snaps

51:23.500 --> 51:29.120
So the core snap would just become snap D and the bits that it needs

51:29.140 --> 51:30.980
Not that will be the new core

51:30.980 --> 51:36.660
So very very small and then the base snap will be that thin shim of runtime

51:36.700 --> 51:41.780
So the default will be the Ubuntu runtime the default the default

51:41.780 --> 51:46.500
Yeah, but we're going to add a facility in the yaml to say base

51:46.500 --> 51:48.380
colon

51:48.380 --> 51:54.420
solace and if Aiki creates a base snap based on the solace runtime

51:55.140 --> 51:57.140
somebody

51:58.660 --> 52:04.540
Somebody could create a snap which is built on top of that solace runtime

52:04.540 --> 52:10.660
and when that snap is installed on Ubuntu you would get that solace base underneath and

52:10.660 --> 52:16.100
Then the application sitting on top and this will be something that you know

52:16.100 --> 52:23.140
Any of the distros can do to create their own base snaps and Aiki can explain why he thinks this will be a useful feature

52:24.060 --> 52:27.580
Optimized optimized libraries. It's gonna be awesome games and stuff. It's gonna be great

52:28.420 --> 52:30.060
Interesting. I just wanted to get that out

52:30.060 --> 52:34.780
I mean it could mean you know, we could also mean a lot of Ubuntu users now can have better libraries

52:34.780 --> 52:36.780
Thanks to solace in a way, you know

52:36.780 --> 52:40.860
I mean like doing a reverse, but now I don't need to switch. I don't need to switch to solace. Yeah

52:40.860 --> 52:43.020
It is a reverse team. It's exactly a reverse team

52:43.860 --> 52:46.940
Revengeous suite. Yeah, that's good. I can see I can see it

52:46.940 --> 52:49.660
And it could you could also see for the fedora project if there was something

52:49.660 --> 52:53.820
It made the most sense to build on top of or you're there's a great angle for this as well. I mean

52:54.420 --> 52:57.700
It's all Travis actually Martin. I'll let you talk about though

52:58.980 --> 53:01.300
Well, what what what do I know about Travis?

53:01.300 --> 53:05.700
I'm just saying Travis like tools are say

53:06.860 --> 53:09.380
What's the other one coveralls and things like that?

53:10.020 --> 53:11.900
Invariably you end up with older stuff

53:11.900 --> 53:13.820
But say like at the moment

53:13.820 --> 53:16.100
I'm having to use Docker to build some of my stuff in tree

53:16.300 --> 53:21.300
Because I don't want to use some of the online services because they're using like a bunch of maverick and stuff like that

53:21.460 --> 53:23.980
So instead of having like a heavyweight Docker image

53:23.980 --> 53:28.220
Which is gonna take me about 10 to 15 minutes to build from a tarball of something

53:28.220 --> 53:31.580
I would then be able to use my solace devel

53:32.380 --> 53:37.100
Kind of snap locally to build budgie and then I could use like the Ubuntu one to build it

53:37.100 --> 53:42.700
So I can do all of my local tests without then having to go through VMs and heavyweight Docker and stuff

53:42.700 --> 53:46.340
So yeah, yeah, that's something I'm very much looking forward to

53:46.340 --> 53:52.300
Yeah, especially for something like budgie as well where you're using like four or five different GTK versions. It's gonna be a godsend

53:52.300 --> 53:58.460
Yeah, and you know, yeah, I've I've I've installed solace on my intro where Apollo

53:59.140 --> 54:02.100
And I'm able to do my day job on solace now

54:02.460 --> 54:09.220
Because I can snap install Docker and I can snap install snap craft and I can snap install Lex D

54:09.220 --> 54:13.120
And although I'm sitting on top of solace now

54:13.120 --> 54:20.060
I can use all of the tools that I need from the you know, the Ubuntu world on this solar system

54:20.060 --> 54:22.420
Just fine. Yeah, that's awesome

54:23.060 --> 54:25.420
We're converging. Yeah, and in

54:26.100 --> 54:29.020
and I suppose in some ways at the end and you know

54:29.020 --> 54:33.660
When I look what I think about a lot of these applications with some of the exceptions that wimpy just put out there

54:33.660 --> 54:35.780
I a lot of the things that I would be using these for

54:36.420 --> 54:42.200
Are applications that never have any interest in being in anybody's repo?

54:42.200 --> 54:47.060
They're never gonna be an OBS there then it's just not what they're interested in

54:47.060 --> 54:52.940
They they develop in a paradigm that is Windows and Mac and on Windows and Mac you have your base OS

54:52.940 --> 54:56.020
And then you just drop your application down on top of it

54:56.020 --> 55:01.300
If you needed your own libraries, you just include them screw with the OS ships. Here's your library link to it

55:01.300 --> 55:02.220
You're good to go

55:02.220 --> 55:04.800
It's all in a bundle and you drop it on the file system

55:04.800 --> 55:09.340
and then when you do a new update you just drop new versions of all that crap right over the old crap on the

55:09.340 --> 55:11.620
file system and this is how they've done it for

55:12.100 --> 55:14.100
going on almost 30 years now and

55:14.100 --> 55:18.180
And there's some applications that even though that's changing

55:18.580 --> 55:21.620
That's that's the culture in which they are created

55:22.100 --> 55:28.100
That's where they come from and they're never going to they're never going to work with the solace

55:28.740 --> 55:30.980
Maintainers to package it up, you know

55:30.980 --> 55:34.820
Like look at look at just all the applications out there that people are using these days

55:34.820 --> 55:39.500
When you look at a desktop with Skype and slack and all these different applications people use

55:40.340 --> 55:41.780
these are just

55:41.780 --> 55:42.960
this

55:42.960 --> 55:47.620
This is just what happens when that kind of application starts coming to the Linux desktop

55:47.620 --> 55:52.680
They're not going to just change their philosophy and start going to each distribution and say please sir

55:52.680 --> 55:57.540
Could you please distribute slack for me? Could you please distribute this to your users this new update?

55:57.540 --> 56:03.660
Could you please distribute it soon? Because it's a vulnerability and we need it fixed and we had to fix something on server side

56:03.660 --> 56:06.820
So if you don't get this client code out there, we can't flip the server side

56:06.820 --> 56:11.260
So could you please work over the weekend and push that out to all of your users? Mr. Debbie and maintainer?

56:11.260 --> 56:14.620
Like that's just that's it's never ever going to happen

56:16.460 --> 56:21.020
So I fix that yeah, so that's why you know, I don't think it's I

56:21.940 --> 56:25.860
Agree with Ikea. I don't think it's I don't think it's the biggest problem facing Linux right now

56:25.860 --> 56:30.180
I really don't but I I do think it's where we are converging

56:30.180 --> 56:35.540
It's making it easier for people to use Linux as a platform to get their shit done. And I think that's really important

56:35.540 --> 56:40.300
I think that's the important part. There is now an emergent platform something that hasn't happened for a long time

56:40.300 --> 56:45.100
Yeah, if you look at any of the over operating systems, I mean you look at the stack that's evolved on Mac OS

56:45.100 --> 56:47.100
There's a very much an emergent platform there

56:47.340 --> 56:53.960
Linux hasn't had one you've had all these disconnected targets and toolkits and libraries and the API's and standards

56:54.100 --> 56:57.380
And now all of a sudden this thing is just starting to bubble up to the surface

56:57.500 --> 57:02.260
it's like a common target a common set of runtimes a common set of expectations and

57:03.080 --> 57:09.100
You know like where does the kernel end the word is distro begin? That's becoming very very clearly defined now

57:09.100 --> 57:12.420
So it's it's getting to a point now where we could say

57:12.420 --> 57:19.140
Okay, if we added more stuff to bring these developers across it's it the deployment issue is basically gone

57:20.140 --> 57:24.460
We have something to resolve one problem. Here's what you can target. Here's the world that you can live in

57:25.020 --> 57:28.060
You have reasonable expectations or any expectation and I could yeah

57:28.060 --> 57:31.860
I mean now we can actually bend over for them, you know bend over backwards for the software

57:32.380 --> 57:38.420
Developers because before it's like oh, well, we can't have your application in because then that means we got to go patch QT

57:38.420 --> 57:43.260
But that version of Q is needed by that thing. We couldn't possibly do that because our users unit

57:43.260 --> 57:48.660
It's like now they can just say well, I'm just gonna do what I do on Windows and ship this patch version to keep with it

57:48.660 --> 57:53.140
We were never gonna stop these people from doing up and now they got away doing that

57:53.140 --> 57:59.140
Yeah, well and you know what sounds like these proposed changes to sort of separate out the the snap processes versus the base

58:01.020 --> 58:04.780
Runtime area means it's not even it's not even an Ubuntu solution anymore

58:04.780 --> 58:09.900
It can just be a Linux solution. And if your Linux is solace or your Linux is SUSE, you're good

58:11.100 --> 58:15.280
So that's pretty great too. So before we go before we wrap up I key, you know

58:15.280 --> 58:19.680
I got a you got a because you've just released a new version. My favorite question to always ask

58:21.260 --> 58:23.260
Is well now what's next

58:24.300 --> 58:28.680
You know you now that you've just spent all of that time and effort getting that out the door

58:30.340 --> 58:32.340
Next what's next? Come on. Give me what's next?

58:32.340 --> 58:38.060
Um, so there's a few things. Okay, so there's an immediate work list to be done after we call it the

58:38.620 --> 58:40.940
It's the meta list the post release blues

58:43.340 --> 58:46.300
One of the first things we got to do is slightly improve our

58:46.780 --> 58:51.760
Basically our pipeline to make us go more faster. That's one of the primary goals going forward

58:52.620 --> 58:59.220
Dropping some standard stuff like the older web kits and rebasing system D, you know the the boring stuff sure

58:59.220 --> 59:05.460
But it's now it's the sort of the time where for solace for we're going to be focusing on the OEM enabling

59:05.660 --> 59:10.780
We're talking to people already and the installer is going to get split up to support an OEM workflow

59:11.140 --> 59:13.140
Which would be very very good

59:13.500 --> 59:17.660
Linux driver manager is actually going back into active development

59:17.660 --> 59:22.880
Which doesn't mean the dynamic optimus GPU support will be coming this year. Hurrah

59:24.180 --> 59:26.180
I'm supposed to drop a bombshell aren't I?

59:26.180 --> 59:33.660
We're all gonna put weight behind the KD plasma stack this year as well. Really? So that's getting brought up

59:33.660 --> 59:40.860
I am willing to permit an out-of-band release for our kitty. Yes that I'm looking forward to seeing that

59:40.860 --> 59:44.740
I really am. I mean, I mean lots of stuff coming this year. Not just

59:45.260 --> 59:49.940
Yeah, I saw you put you basically put a chart up online that says these are a lot of the things we're working on

59:49.940 --> 59:52.460
Right now and there's a lot of core infrastructure stuff you're working on

59:52.460 --> 59:56.460
Yeah, I mean one of the things that's kind of been bugging me like as a distribution

59:56.460 --> 59:59.540
We say these are the rules for things that can come into our repos, you know

59:59.540 --> 01:00:05.460
And sometimes not everyone has agreed with our reasons for things going into the repos

01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:10.800
But one of the things that's interested me is building the best-in-class pipeline

01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:15.140
I am interested in building something that's effectively a source to deployment

01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:21.000
Pipeline so once that tarball or sources or that stuff goes into the distribution

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:26.320
We're scanning at that level first before it goes anywhere else. So we're gonna be doing static analysis

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:35.040
We even like license calculations once it goes in and then that's gonna be tracking those build out our facts all the way through the repositories

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:40.640
To the final image so that we can basically track the entire distribution and we can say anywhere, you know

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:41.560
These are the problems

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:45.920
These are the things that we have to target so that we can actually say to people using solace, you know

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:47.880
Well, here's a bit of peace of mind, you know

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:51.320
so that's one of the things I personally want to be focusing on but

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:53.360
Yeah

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:57.800
But 11 at some stage, that's what everybody that's what's on everyone's mind

01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:00.680
But it sounds like there's a lot of good core stuff getting worked on right now

01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:02.920
I mean, that's why I did budget 10.4

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:06.960
But not I there was actually a load of us and a lot of it was a Stefan helping me there

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:11.640
Like the new workspaces stuff the new animations window. That was all Stefan

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:14.360
10.4 was kind of

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:20.440
At LTS I would say because there was a lot of problems in the existing 10.3 release

01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:23.920
Like if you had a bottom panel and you click the budget menu

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:26.640
Sometimes it would appear down the bottom

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:29.160
Sometimes it would start at the top

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:34.560
So every row that put new budget popovers in so the idea was to give me more time

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:38.740
So that we didn't have to worry about budget lever a little bit longer, you know

01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:43.520
So the people have a stable desktop to use day to day. Yeah, and I'll put you lovingly start that bit later

01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:47.400
Yeah, I think that probably played I think I that's kind of what I was like thinking to myself

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:50.160
It's like this is this is getting sort of refined now

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:54.000
I could probably throw this on a production machine and be comfortable for a while. So that's what I did

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.360
I would yeah, I mean, it's kind of our goal, you know get to the point where we can say, you know

01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:04.280
This is a world-class OS that we're shipping and that's why I'm again too. So it's a bit of a journey

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:08.600
Lots of things are coming into place with the Software Center improvements

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:14.400
And I mean some of the most important things we're doing right now is collaborating with other projects and working outside of solace

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:18.280
And I think that's very very important to us and the rest of the Linux community. Yeah

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:23.360
And it sounds like it's all been going pretty good and been kicking some ass. Mr. Wimpy speaking of some of that cross collab

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:28.520
Speaking across collab. You're gonna be at odd camp this coming weekend, correct? I

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:34.200
Am yes, and you are doing a bit of a mashup show down there, aren't you?

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:36.760
We are yeah

01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:37.800
I think

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:38.960
so

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:47.560
We're gonna do a live show on I think the Saturday evening and Joe Ressington is organizing that so it's a mashup of

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:53.860
Some of the late-night Linux podcasters and some of the Ubuntu podcasters

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:59.320
We we're gonna do a live podcast with a Q&A section

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:05.840
In fact, I'll have a link in the show notes. Joe's just put a call out for questions for odd camp

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:09.680
they have a Google form that you can fill out with your question or

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:13.800
You can go to their late night linux.com slash contact page and probably email it in

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:15.480
or

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:17.480
URL is late night linux.com

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:23.520
Forward slash ask. Oh, yeah or hashtag ask. Oh, that's a good. I like that

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:28.720
Yes, we have we're using hashtag ask error right now for for user error

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:32.420
Ask August that's good. We should have asked lup

01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:35.340
All right. So yeah, there you go

01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:41.100
So there with that you can find links in the show notes to that stuff. Also check out wimpy on the Ubuntu podcast

01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:46.780
I'm gonna be looking forward to that episode. Are you guys gonna put a bout out in both of your feeds? How does that work?

01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:54.180
In the past we have done I think we don't do these sort of cross distro cross podcasting

01:03:55.620 --> 01:04:01.380
But yeah, I did one with the guys at ubu con last year and we put that out on the Ubuntu podcast feed

01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:03.500
So probably yes

01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:10.980
So long as we don't make her Horlicks off it and it goes well then yeah, we'll publish it. Yeah, I hope it's fun

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:15.220
I hope it's fun. Well guys great work. Thank you very much for chatting with us about that

01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:20.860
I have just a little slack wear follow-up to do and the best bug I've ever seen submitted

01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:25.580
Simon sent it into the show and we got to talk about it really quickly. I want to thank ting though

01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:28.640
Just full stop right here. This is one of these sponsors

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:33.500
I've been using now for years and it's made a real difference. It's it's so simple

01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:39.180
I really don't have time to deal with complicated wireless stuff or really pay out the nose for stuff

01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:45.500
I don't use and that's why I like ting it's six dollars a month for your wireless and then whatever you use you just pay for

01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:48.940
So a few minutes and your messages and your megabytes, that's just what I don't use minutes

01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:53.980
Really? In fact, there's been months where I've not used a minute not a minute now there are months

01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:58.860
There are months where I use minutes and I may use many of those minutes

01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:03.900
But I got to tell you it really averages out. I'm saving about two thousand dollars a year every two years

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:08.940
So about a thousand dollars a year Wow, you know average ting bills about twenty three dollars per phone

01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:13.980
but what's what's the reason why it's such a huge savings for me is I had two lines and

01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:18.420
I was paying I was paying probably after-tax a hundred and forty dollars a month for two phones

01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:25.100
Um now we have three phones and I'm usually paying around thirty seven forty bucks a month

01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:27.820
That's crazy. Yeah, it's crazy

01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:30.740
Linux dot ting comm I love it

01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:36.900
You pay for what you use nationwide coverage GSM and CDMA and a dashboard that guess what goes for days

01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:42.620
They also have apps for your device and fantastic customer support Linux dot ting comm

01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:46.940
You got to go there to support the show and you get twenty five dollars in service credit

01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:51.420
If you bring a GSM or a CDMA they got yep

01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:55.020
They got a BYOD page check or if you just want to buy a new one from them

01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:57.760
They'll give it twenty five dollars off the phone Linux dot ting comm

01:05:58.460 --> 01:06:05.840
Damn, you know you're excited if you use the service you're excited if you don't use the service Linux dot ting comm so slack wear thoughts

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:11.060
You know I I didn't really expect to use it much after the show West to be honest with you

01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:16.180
But me you know I sat down and it was on the machine that I was gonna load with gen 2 and I thought well

01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:20.420
You know I never really got all the way like I never felt like I didn't you know

01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:24.900
I was I just I didn't have I didn't get to that point where I'm just using it to screw around

01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:26.900
I was always in that mode

01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:32.420
For like reviewing it for the show yeah, yeah, and you know I thought about it a little bit

01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:34.420
I thought to myself if

01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:40.060
If you go into slack wear, and you don't you know you're not expecting it to be a boon to you know

01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:44.460
You're not expecting it to to be soulless you go in you go in with that kind of mindset

01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:50.540
It was a lot of fun to get my nostalgia on but after after I got over the nostalgia aspect of it

01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:52.540
Which is kind of what I talked about the most last week

01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:54.500
I

01:06:54.500 --> 01:07:02.780
realized that it reminded me of a of a different time where Linux was simpler in and a lot easier to just

01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:04.620
straight up

01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:09.780
Understand just like I can see it how it's all laid out right here. It makes a lot of sense to me and

01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:14.580
There's something else about it. It's it's it's not that it's like raw Linux. It's

01:07:15.540 --> 01:07:20.260
For better or for worse like if you're comfortable with the versions of software that slack where has available

01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:23.940
And there's like slack scripts and stuff to get newer stuff like you know newer versions of Firefox

01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:25.700
but like say you wanted like Apache and

01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:32.700
You know a mail program like post fix and maybe a database, and it just didn't need to be super super current stuff

01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:35.900
It's just something you wanted in your house to like serve your favorite links up

01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:39.780
And you wanted a mysql database for the back end for your photo management program or whatever

01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:43.820
Slack where is kind of perfect because

01:07:45.460 --> 01:07:49.500
It's it's an era of Linux where you could install it

01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:53.740
It's like it's so much like arch except for without nothing like ours

01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:55.420
I

01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:57.740
Struggled to relate that because you can install it

01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:00.020
And then you can literally not come back to it for two years

01:08:00.020 --> 01:08:05.140
And if in two years after not even touching this box you log in and all of a sudden you want to install a new

01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:07.020
Package it's fine

01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:08.580
It's it's totally fine

01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:12.660
It's not a big deal if you wanted if you even and you maybe maybe

01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:18.780
Maybe been some updates to slack where like maybe a point release maybe an update to slack where but probably not

01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:22.220
Like it's it's the it's like it's a kind of computing

01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:29.300
We no longer have access to because all of our devices either constantly are getting abandoned by the vendor or need to be updated

01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:30.700
It's either or

01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:35.900
My Chromecast I use it so rarely that I swear every damn time I turn it on I have to wait ten minutes while

01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:42.100
It updates every single time you know my set-top box on my TV updates every single month it is

01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:44.620
It's just this

01:08:44.780 --> 01:08:45.980
non-stop

01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:52.700
Let us improve that experience for you and often the experience is not improved and there really is something to be said

01:08:52.700 --> 01:09:00.700
For this time and I remember it in Linux where there was just so much time between releases software moved

01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:02.620
slower

01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:08.580
it just moved slower and and you could install a Debian box and let it just sit in a closet and

01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:11.380
Nothing had really changed on it

01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:18.140
And that's what slackware represents that time that we have lost access to in almost all aspects of our life

01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:24.100
And and I wouldn't necessarily want to live there right, but I could see like if I just had a utility box sitting in the corner

01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:28.540
Hosting up some websites for my LAN, and I didn't need to be a big deal

01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:34.060
It's and you didn't want to make it a big old project or like you know like you set it up once you got involved

01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:37.300
With it you understood how everything worked, and yeah, you come back to it

01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:43.500
There wasn't a whole lot of extra stuff that will suddenly show up or change or there's a real sense of ownership there

01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:45.980
Yeah, exactly so I could I could totally see the long-term

01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:49.100
But you get the fun of like an arch system where you're piecing it together yourself

01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:51.140
But you don't have to that's what it is constantly

01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:54.580
Yeah, read a blog to make sure that you're not gonna break your system. That is what it is

01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:59.260
So here's this was sent into the show by Simon, and this is my favorite

01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:03.980
this is my favorite bug of the week it was submitted to Dimitri by Dimitri and

01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:11.340
It's over on the Ubuntu mailing list as a bug and he has a question. He says the subject is y2k 100 bug is

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:17.300
Is it reasonable to expect the below that the Ubuntu version numbers below will be accurate in?

01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:19.340
in April

01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:23.900
2100 it's going to be Ubuntu 100 dot 04 LTS

01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:26.300
but in

01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:28.300
April of the year 3000

01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:35.660
It's going to be 1000 dot 04 dot LTS which obviously wouldn't make any sense since it's the year 3000 so you have you know

01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:37.860
Obviously there's a there's a numbering problem here

01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:43.540
a very important problem that Dimitri brings up and so the Ubuntu development team took a

01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:49.020
Long hard look at this bug and they came back with what I think is a pretty solid answer

01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:51.540
And I'm imagining they're gonna just go ahead and consider this one resolved

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:59.120
The answer from the Ubuntu team is the world will have been obliterated by nuclear war and biochemical warfare by then

01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:01.140
So no need to worry about it

01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:06.460
I feel way more assured. You know you sometimes. There's this little things you don't have to worry about

01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:10.140
Does make you wonder how they know about that ahead of time?

01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:15.620
I wonder if it's like the Apple stuff where they don't you know at Apple

01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:20.740
They have like you can't use iTunes we at a nuke base like I wonder if I went to has that in the terms of

01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:22.740
Service maybe they don't install

01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:28.820
Anyways, thank you everybody for coming in the moment, but specifically

01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:32.740
Thank you to wimpy and I key for being there. Thank you to our regulars for making it this week

01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:37.820
Even though there wasn't a lot of time for everybody. I see you I appreciate you guys making it the mumble room, too

01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:40.300
I hope you can join us next week. I may or may not be here

01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:45.780
Depending on how crazy that Eclipse is that could be it could be the at the lost episode for me

01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:49.660
We'll see but if I do make it why don't you join us?

01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:52.740
We'll do it live over JB live TV at 2 p.m.. Pacific

01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:59.860
You can get that converted from JB time to your time at Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar Linux unplug dot reddit comm is the sub

01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:05.620
Reddit Jupiter broadcasting comm slash contacts the way to get us and the network's at Jupiter signal at Jupiter signal. That's where you find it

01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:22.900
Thanks for joining us

01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:37.620
You

01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:46.900
Okay, let's unleash the hounds JB titles comm let's pick our title before we go

01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:52.660
Did you want to toss anything else development wise going on? We're thinking about having reoccurring development meetings

01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:58.260
We should maybe mention that so and discord dot is a discord emmy slash Jupiter colony

01:12:58.260 --> 01:13:01.940
Yeah, that'll be getting set up over there for more developer participation

01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:04.840
But was there anything else we want to mention development wise, right?

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:06.840
So so what is it Beardsley?

01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:09.420
We have a

01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:12.180
Jupiter dev channel on the discord now

01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:20.220
And I was talking with one of the developers that's helped out in JB in the past and he's he's kind of thinking about

01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:22.700
leading a

01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:26.440
We haven't decided how often maybe weekly maybe monthly

01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:33.500
Like a development meetup for the JB community really to work on on JB projects in in discord

01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:39.840
uh, yeah, so probably some mix of voice chat and text chat sweet and

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:45.400
It was partially spurred on by the fact that we're kind of

01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:49.700
Toying with the idea of maybe completely rewriting

01:13:52.400 --> 01:14:00.200
Of course every open source project eventually gets to this point. Yeah. Well, there's a lot of inherited crap and

01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:02.200
And

01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:08.140
We kind of need to just dump all of that to be able to expand what we want JB to do

01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:16.400
So you're saying it's gonna be rebuilt better than ever yeah, you have the technology I heard we're gonna rebuild it better faster and stronger

01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:19.280
What are you gonna build it with?

01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:22.440
Probably still gonna be Ruby

01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:27.800
If you would have said rust, I think you would have had a lot of people excited. Maybe we'll go crazy

01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:32.480
Maybe we'll do elixir. I was gonna say yeah elixir. I think you should I hear great things

01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:36.600
Yeah, there you go. Yeah, I noticed that a new bug was opened

01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:38.920
I think it was new bug was open up on the soundboard. We're getting it

01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:42.080
We're trying to get a few more things fixed on the soundboard. I want to get

01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:44.960
basically

01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:49.280
State saving per action for the sound. Oh, yes. Yes. Yes that way if it crashes

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:54.520
You don't lose all your or the machine. Yeah, or the machines were running on crashes. Yeah in the case

01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:59.220
I love you guys. Thank you guys speaking of the the soundboard

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:07.880
Since you have snap on solace now, you can install the soundboard. Oh, yeah, that's right. I might is your soundboard not portable

01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:22.440
It is an a you are
