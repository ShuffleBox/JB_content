WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.240
So there's one thing I thought we'd talk about before the show starts, and that's the Omega

00:04.240 --> 00:09.000
2, a $5 Linux computer with Wi-Fi built in.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
That is nuts.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
And of course, it's on Kickstarter with Kickstarter music.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
We use development boards to build all sorts of cool stuff.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.840
Most development boards on the market fell short of our expectations.

00:21.840 --> 00:25.880
They're bulky, confusing to set up and over complicated.

00:25.880 --> 00:30.680
We usually spend far more time reading the documentation than actually using them to

00:30.680 --> 00:31.680
build things.

00:31.680 --> 00:34.880
Today, we're changing that.

00:34.880 --> 00:36.880
That is one of the dumbest statements I've ever heard.

00:36.880 --> 00:40.320
Say hello to the Omega 2, the world's simplest development board.

00:40.320 --> 00:42.760
The Omega 2 is tiny.

00:42.760 --> 00:47.840
At less than a quarter of the size of your credit card, it can easily fit into any project.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.560
But don't be fooled by its size.

00:49.560 --> 00:51.640
The Omega 2 is powerful.

00:51.640 --> 00:54.160
It is a full Linux computer.

00:54.160 --> 00:58.640
That's right, this tiny purple thing runs the same operating system that powers some

00:58.640 --> 01:02.640
of the world's most efficient infrastructure.

01:02.640 --> 01:04.720
The Omega 2 works out of the box.

01:04.720 --> 01:09.720
It comes with built in Wi-Fi and onboard storage, so it comes to life the moment you power it

01:09.720 --> 01:10.720
on.

01:10.720 --> 01:13.720
Onboard storage for something that small is impressive.

01:13.720 --> 01:14.720
Built in Wi-Fi too.

01:14.720 --> 01:17.660
You can control it with apps just like your regular computer.

01:17.660 --> 01:22.340
We even have an app store so you can discover apps created by the community.

01:22.340 --> 01:24.680
The Omega 2 is easy to program.

01:24.680 --> 01:27.480
In fact, you don't even have to write any code.

01:27.480 --> 01:33.120
It supports Node-RED, a graphical tool that you can use to create programs by simple drag

01:33.120 --> 01:36.000
and drop.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.720
But if you are into writing code, the Omega 2 supports many programming languages.

01:40.720 --> 01:47.960
So I was a backer of the Omega 1 and also TechSnap host Alan Jude, huge fan of the Omega

01:47.960 --> 01:48.960
1.

01:48.960 --> 01:51.360
They actually really delivered on the first Omega.

01:51.360 --> 01:57.640
So they make some pretty funny claims, but they are already, because of their past success,

01:57.640 --> 02:04.720
they are just, look at this, they are crushing it with a goal of $15,000.

02:04.720 --> 02:07.640
They have raised $268,392.

02:07.640 --> 02:15.560
Holy smokes, so the Omega 2 is coming.

02:15.560 --> 02:21.760
I don't know, I'm interested, especially with the built-in Wi-Fi.

02:21.760 --> 02:22.760
Incredible.

02:22.760 --> 02:23.760
Yeah.

02:23.760 --> 02:24.760
I wonder how...

02:24.760 --> 02:25.760
This is considerably incredible.

02:25.760 --> 02:27.440
Can I just back that right now?

02:27.440 --> 02:36.400
With Wi-Fi and storage built-in for $5, will it really be $5 when it ships?

02:36.400 --> 02:42.540
See if you pledge $10, you get your hands on the Omega 2 Plus, double the memory and

02:42.540 --> 02:44.400
storage and double the fun.

02:44.400 --> 02:49.880
And it includes a built-in microSD slot and shipping by November too.

02:49.880 --> 02:50.880
Wow, really?

02:50.880 --> 02:52.360
I guess that they've got the supply chain down.

02:52.360 --> 02:55.840
Yeah, they've got the supply chain, look at that, look at that compared to a size, that's

02:55.840 --> 02:57.760
compared to a cherry right there.

02:57.760 --> 03:01.000
That is amazing.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.140
That is amazing.

03:03.140 --> 03:20.280
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 157 for August 9th, 2016.

03:20.280 --> 03:25.640
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux podcast that's wrenching all of the news out

03:25.640 --> 03:27.560
of the dry August month.

03:27.560 --> 03:28.560
My name is Chris.

03:28.560 --> 03:29.560
My name is Wes.

03:29.560 --> 03:30.560
Did I get that right, Wes?

03:30.560 --> 03:31.560
Pretty good, pretty good, Chris.

03:31.560 --> 03:32.560
I like it.

03:32.560 --> 03:36.920
Actually, I thought at the beginning of the week we were going to have a small show for

03:36.920 --> 03:37.920
you.

03:37.920 --> 03:38.920
And I hate saying that.

03:38.920 --> 03:39.920
Right.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.240
And I thought, okay, maybe we might end up with a medium-sized show.

03:42.240 --> 03:43.240
We were hoping for a nice, medium, average.

03:43.240 --> 03:46.240
Yeah, because August tends to be a little slow.

03:46.240 --> 03:47.240
People are on vacay.

03:47.240 --> 03:48.240
Yeah, exactly.

03:48.240 --> 03:52.200
But no, it turns out we have a big show coming up on 157.

03:52.200 --> 03:55.840
Linux botnets are on a rampage, apparently.

03:55.840 --> 04:01.560
And it's because you suck at managing them, at least according to experts, quote, unquote,

04:01.560 --> 04:03.540
will tell you about this ridiculous story.

04:03.540 --> 04:06.920
The guys over at Solace have a pretty nice, solid upgrade.

04:06.920 --> 04:09.840
Humble has a bundle that actually includes some Linux games.

04:09.840 --> 04:14.480
We've got some benchmarks that compare Ubuntu versus Ubuntu on Windows, native versus Windows.

04:14.480 --> 04:16.960
And it's actually kind of interesting.

04:16.960 --> 04:17.960
Snap's got some updates.

04:17.960 --> 04:24.920
And then later on in the show, we're going to talk about our favorite SSH hacks.

04:24.920 --> 04:28.940
One of the coolest tools ever invented for internet communications, built right into

04:28.940 --> 04:30.080
our Linux box.

04:30.080 --> 04:31.080
And there's so many neat things.

04:31.080 --> 04:35.200
So we're going to go around the virtual log and talk about some of our favorite SSH tricks.

04:35.200 --> 04:37.000
And Wes and I will share ours.

04:37.000 --> 04:42.280
Plus, we'll tell you about a new feature in OpenSSH 7.3 that was just released that's

04:42.280 --> 04:44.000
really cool.

04:44.000 --> 04:50.120
Then after all of that, inspired by Noah's app pick this week, I'm going to talk about

04:50.120 --> 04:56.880
how I have recently started using tag spaces to tag and manage my local encrypted text

04:56.880 --> 05:04.440
files with a system that allows me to add keywords and groups and labels and metadata

05:04.440 --> 05:08.120
information on top of my file system.

05:08.120 --> 05:09.120
Whoa.

05:09.120 --> 05:10.120
Yeah.

05:10.120 --> 05:11.120
That's very interesting.

05:11.120 --> 05:12.120
It's tag spaces.

05:12.120 --> 05:13.960
The communities, all credit goes to them, really.

05:13.960 --> 05:14.960
I tell you.

05:14.960 --> 05:15.960
You know what?

05:15.960 --> 05:16.960
Somebody pointed me in the direction.

05:16.960 --> 05:17.960
I looked into it.

05:17.960 --> 05:18.960
And I was damn impressed.

05:18.960 --> 05:19.960
So I've just started messing around with it.

05:19.960 --> 05:20.960
I'm going to give you my quick take on it.

05:20.960 --> 05:24.920
But before we do that, we have community updates.

05:24.920 --> 05:28.720
So let's bring in our virtual lug, time appropriate greetings, mumble room.

05:28.720 --> 05:29.720
Hello.

05:29.720 --> 05:30.720
Hello.

05:30.720 --> 05:31.720
Hello.

05:31.720 --> 05:32.720
Greetings.

05:32.720 --> 05:33.720
Hello.

05:33.720 --> 05:34.720
Hello.

05:34.720 --> 05:36.400
So I'm excited to break this next story down with you guys.

05:36.400 --> 05:37.400
Hello.

05:37.400 --> 05:38.400
Hi.

05:38.400 --> 05:41.560
This, you know, I just, I smiled when I saw the headline.

05:41.560 --> 05:45.320
It was one of those where I saw it go by and I'm like, open a new tab, coming back to that

05:45.320 --> 05:46.320
one later.

05:46.320 --> 05:49.480
And it is now time to share it with you.

05:49.480 --> 05:57.240
Linux botnets are on a rampage.

05:57.240 --> 05:58.240
That's right, Wes.

05:58.240 --> 06:00.040
Not just your average rampage.

06:00.040 --> 06:01.040
Oh, no.

06:01.040 --> 06:02.040
Oh, no.

06:02.040 --> 06:05.000
A rampage of epic proportions.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.120
Linux-operated botnet distributed denial of service attacks have surged in the year's

06:09.120 --> 06:14.280
second quarter due to a growing interest in targeting Chinese servers and Wes.

06:14.280 --> 06:18.880
This is according to Kaspersky Labs that was in a report released last week.

06:18.880 --> 06:19.880
Now, I'm scared.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.440
I'm just going to come on right and say it right now.

06:21.440 --> 06:22.440
I'm scared.

06:22.440 --> 06:23.720
How does Linux fit in?

06:23.720 --> 06:28.360
Well, the Linux server is the go-to platform, they say, for orchestrating denial of service

06:28.360 --> 06:34.720
attacks because of its latent vulnerabilities, said Charles King, a principal analyst at

06:34.720 --> 06:35.720
Pund-IT.

06:35.720 --> 06:41.840
A common problem is they're not protected by reliable security solutions.

06:41.840 --> 06:42.840
He goes on to say.

06:42.840 --> 06:43.840
Oh.

06:43.840 --> 06:48.040
Is he perhaps a vendor of any of that I could buy for him?

06:48.040 --> 06:49.040
Why don't you Google?

06:49.040 --> 06:55.160
I have a hyperlink, but it's Pund-IT, P-U-N-T-IT.

06:55.160 --> 06:56.160
Let's see.

06:56.160 --> 06:59.720
Their URL is Pund-IT.com.

06:59.720 --> 07:04.240
We shouldn't give them any promotion, but that means you got to look for me.

07:04.240 --> 07:05.240
All right.

07:05.240 --> 07:08.200
So he goes on to say, this is a quote from this principal analyst here.

07:08.200 --> 07:10.740
What the hell is that even?

07:10.740 --> 07:14.800
That makes them prime targets for hackers, especially those that leverage C&C servers

07:14.800 --> 07:18.160
to centrally manage and carry out denial of service attacks.

07:18.160 --> 07:19.880
This is what he told Linux Insider.

07:19.880 --> 07:23.920
Deploying leading security solutions as well as utilizing and updating established Linux

07:23.920 --> 07:28.500
distros can go a long way to protecting against these kinds of issues.

07:28.500 --> 07:31.600
So what are you grokking when you visit their website there, Wes?

07:31.600 --> 07:33.840
They have some solutions they could sell me, perhaps?

07:33.840 --> 07:34.840
Actually not much.

07:34.840 --> 07:35.840
It's a pretty minimal website.

07:35.840 --> 07:36.840
So this guy's a BS guy?

07:36.840 --> 07:37.840
Yeah.

07:37.840 --> 07:38.840
Oh, my God.

07:38.840 --> 07:40.580
I got to show this on the live stream.

07:40.580 --> 07:43.300
This is embarrassingly bad.

07:43.300 --> 07:45.180
You have to see this.

07:45.180 --> 07:50.760
This is like a WordPress template.

07:50.760 --> 07:57.560
This is as low-budge as it gets, and this is a leading principal analyst that is railing

07:57.560 --> 07:58.560
against.

07:58.560 --> 07:59.560
OK, so he goes on.

07:59.560 --> 08:06.960
This expert goes on to talk about how, and by the way, listen to the logic in this.

08:06.960 --> 08:09.480
Listen to the logic, and tell me how much sense this makes.

08:09.480 --> 08:10.480
He goes on.

08:10.480 --> 08:12.920
Remember, this is a botnet rampage, breaking news, you guys.

08:12.920 --> 08:15.480
We don't see any changes in tactics.

08:15.480 --> 08:20.200
Brute forcing passwords, exploiting common vulnerabilities in web applications, hijacking

08:20.200 --> 08:23.080
or sniffing wireless communications.

08:23.080 --> 08:26.280
These are old and well-known issues and threats.

08:26.280 --> 08:33.640
Now brute forcing passwords, exploiting common vulnerabilities in web applications, and hijacking

08:33.640 --> 08:36.040
or sniffing wireless communications.

08:36.040 --> 08:41.960
How is this taking advantage of latent vulnerabilities, quote unquote, in Linux?

08:41.960 --> 08:45.440
Stiffening wireless passwords and brute forcing passwords, that's not latent vulnerabilities

08:45.440 --> 08:46.840
in Linux.

08:46.840 --> 08:47.840
This is trash.

08:47.840 --> 08:48.840
Mm-hmm.

08:48.840 --> 08:51.720
Which, I mean, not to say that there aren't, or that Linux security is a very legitimate

08:51.720 --> 08:54.080
topic, especially in IoT in that rain.

08:54.080 --> 08:55.080
But yeah, you're right.

08:55.080 --> 08:58.440
What he was saying before really seemed like it was going to be a kernel level or something

08:58.440 --> 08:59.440
at the core here.

08:59.440 --> 09:00.440
Yeah.

09:00.440 --> 09:05.120
Now, John McCarty, he's got a Cisco cert, and he works for Aztec Consulting, and he

09:05.120 --> 09:11.920
is a direct quote, Linux is becoming more commonplace and used in most embedded systems.

09:11.920 --> 09:14.880
Okay, well, that's actually wrong too.

09:14.880 --> 09:19.320
I mean, Linux isn't becoming commonplace in the server environment, which is the context

09:19.320 --> 09:20.320
in which he's speaking.

09:20.320 --> 09:22.160
Linux has been commonplace.

09:22.160 --> 09:24.400
So that's, okay, that's a minor thing.

09:24.400 --> 09:30.280
And in embedded systems, yeah, Linux is pretty successful, so is NetBSD, so is Android.

09:30.280 --> 09:32.000
Those are other platforms that are also successful.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.560
But he goes on to say, these implementations are often not hardened or patched or upgraded

09:36.560 --> 09:37.560
regularly.

09:37.560 --> 09:38.560
I agree with that.

09:38.560 --> 09:43.040
Which has led to these systems being compromised and becoming part of a botnet.

09:43.040 --> 09:48.200
I would like to see numbers, because to me, and I absolutely have participated in the

09:48.200 --> 09:49.200
hysteria.

09:49.200 --> 09:50.200
I hand up...

09:50.200 --> 09:52.000
I thought you were going to say you participated in a botnet there.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.600
No, no, hand up to the sky.

09:53.600 --> 09:58.920
I have participated in the hysteria, but the hysteria goes something like this.

09:58.920 --> 10:02.920
There are so many unpatched Linux devices all around the world that at any moment the

10:02.920 --> 10:07.560
entire infrastructure could go Mr. Robot on us and we could all come crashing down.

10:07.560 --> 10:09.960
Oh my God, all of the patches.

10:09.960 --> 10:11.880
That's the hysteria.

10:11.880 --> 10:17.880
But we actually haven't had a doomsday scenario yet.

10:17.880 --> 10:22.480
There hasn't been that moment where everything's come crashing down.

10:22.480 --> 10:27.640
It is definitely reasonable and logical to be concerned, prepared, and thoughtful about

10:27.640 --> 10:28.640
this issue.

10:28.640 --> 10:34.680
But it is not necessarily reasonable to be so hysterical to say that Linux botnets are

10:34.680 --> 10:40.200
on a rampage because people can sniff Wi-Fi and crack passwords.

10:40.200 --> 10:41.600
There's a cognitive disconnect here.

10:41.600 --> 10:47.360
I also wonder who exactly this article is targeting, because it's either just the lazy

10:47.360 --> 10:50.520
sys admins, but there's not a lot of technical details.

10:50.520 --> 10:54.920
And it really doesn't help a desktop Linux user to do anything except for maybe go try

10:54.920 --> 10:57.960
to buy antivirus software that they don't need.

10:57.960 --> 10:58.960
You know what?

10:58.960 --> 11:01.840
We'll bring up the antivirus software when it comes back to the Ubuntu on Windows benchmarks.

11:01.840 --> 11:03.920
Turns out, big, big difference there.

11:03.920 --> 11:06.680
All right, so just wanted to put that out there.

11:06.680 --> 11:07.680
You'll see the news.

11:07.680 --> 11:11.520
Linux botnets on a rampage and it just, I scratch my head.

11:11.520 --> 11:16.120
I don't see Ikey or Josh in the mumble room today.

11:16.120 --> 11:18.000
They're probably too busy blogging or something.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.700
They do a lot of that.

11:19.700 --> 11:23.660
They do have some new features though in Solus, which I wanted to just mention really quickly

11:23.660 --> 11:27.080
because I'm always impressed with at the speed they get this cool stuff out.

11:27.080 --> 11:30.880
They've upgraded their entire Gnome stack from version 3.18 to 3.20.

11:30.880 --> 11:31.880
Nice.

11:31.880 --> 11:34.880
Yeah, I know.

11:34.880 --> 11:37.480
That's not just nice because Gnome 3.20 is pretty solid.

11:37.480 --> 11:43.280
It also means you get things like Flatpak, but it's also, what's really nice is a lot

11:43.280 --> 11:51.560
of the GTK desktop distros, not all of them, and with some significant missing notable

11:51.560 --> 11:54.240
ones, but a lot of them are all landing on 3.20.

11:54.240 --> 11:56.760
It seems like a milestone release.

11:56.760 --> 11:59.440
Yeah, it's becoming a nice base, reliable.

11:59.440 --> 12:04.720
I think the 3.20 will become the GTK platform for a while, and so it's really nice to see.

12:04.720 --> 12:06.320
That's just, I think, I don't know.

12:06.320 --> 12:07.320
Maybe not.

12:07.320 --> 12:08.320
It'd be nice.

12:08.320 --> 12:09.320
It's a nice round number.

12:09.320 --> 12:11.320
Yeah, and it seems to have a pretty wide adoption.

12:11.320 --> 12:16.020
Another major change in Solus is they've got Linux 4.7 in there now, which of course brings

12:16.020 --> 12:21.320
better hardware support and under the hood improvements like AMD GPU support, PowerPlay

12:21.320 --> 12:27.080
support, NVIDIA GeForce 800M support, and Maxwell support, as well as C720 trackpad

12:27.080 --> 12:35.280
support, finally, and last but not least, USB 3.1 support, as well as support for third-party

12:35.280 --> 12:39.920
generation or random generation of Thunderbolt IDs, Polaris architecture support, multiple

12:39.920 --> 12:49.040
Radeon features, and Skylake improvements, as well as whatever SKL, RAPL support is.

12:49.040 --> 12:50.040
In color management.

12:50.040 --> 12:51.840
It's a color management thing that's way beyond.

12:51.840 --> 12:52.840
Yeah, me too.

12:52.840 --> 12:53.840
But apparently it's in Solus.

12:53.840 --> 12:55.120
It sounds like a great kernel to have.

12:55.120 --> 12:56.120
It does sound like a great...

12:56.120 --> 12:57.120
You know what?

12:57.120 --> 12:58.120
It sounds like a great distro.

12:58.120 --> 12:59.120
Yes, it does.

12:59.120 --> 13:04.680
Legitimately, me, I'm always the one that's like, oh, it doesn't have these packages.

13:04.680 --> 13:12.960
But if Aiki could get over his apparent philosophical hump about SNAPs and more and more stuff started

13:12.960 --> 13:14.880
coming out of SNAPs, I could use Solus's...

13:14.880 --> 13:21.680
I mean, imagine if the world's largest Linux podcast was using SolOS, or however it's pronounced,

13:21.680 --> 13:22.680
on its desktop.

13:22.680 --> 13:27.320
And not only would I be using SolOS on my desktop, but I'd be screwing up that pronunciation

13:27.320 --> 13:30.520
all the time, so they'd be getting multiple name mentions.

13:30.520 --> 13:31.520
It's great.

13:31.520 --> 13:32.520
It's great.

13:32.520 --> 13:36.120
And so if they just implemented SNAP support, I could almost do it.

13:36.120 --> 13:37.120
It's ironic, isn't it?

13:37.120 --> 13:38.120
It's ironic.

13:38.120 --> 13:39.120
Is this your tacit endorsement?

13:39.120 --> 13:40.120
What's that?

13:40.120 --> 13:41.120
Oh.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.120
Hello, sir.

13:42.120 --> 13:43.120
Wait a minute.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.120
Wait a minute.

13:44.120 --> 13:45.120
Wait a minute.

13:45.120 --> 13:46.600
Did a wild Aiki just show up?

13:46.600 --> 13:48.600
Like you say his name three times.

13:48.600 --> 13:50.520
He pronounces distro wrong.

13:50.520 --> 13:51.520
He's there.

13:51.520 --> 13:52.520
Yeah, I love it.

13:52.520 --> 13:53.520
Okay.

13:53.520 --> 13:58.240
So wait a minute, because last time you and I talked, you were like the anti-SNAP guy.

13:58.240 --> 14:04.360
Well, at least you very well articulated the other side, I should say.

14:04.360 --> 14:05.360
Yeah.

14:05.360 --> 14:09.520
I mean, it's a case of far and against, but I mean, we've been a little bit more flexible

14:09.520 --> 14:13.120
about a couple of things lately, like Electron apps are now allowed in Solus.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.120
Oh.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.120
That is a big step.

14:15.120 --> 14:16.120
Such as Slack.

14:16.120 --> 14:20.200
Like I was vehemently against that and wanted it to die in a fire, but I've allowed it in

14:20.200 --> 14:23.120
because at the end of the day, once you sit down there thinking, it's like, I'm a C guy

14:23.120 --> 14:27.120
and I'm going to hate basically every bit of software that's ever been written by anyone,

14:27.120 --> 14:28.120
including myself.

14:28.120 --> 14:29.120
Yep.

14:29.120 --> 14:31.760
So I was like, well, you know, it's not really about what I want, is it?

14:31.760 --> 14:33.880
It's kind of what the users want.

14:33.880 --> 14:36.480
So Electron apps and things like that are now finding their way into the repos.

14:36.480 --> 14:39.480
I mean, we've had Kodi and everything going in in the last few days.

14:39.480 --> 14:40.480
Really?

14:40.480 --> 14:41.480
Wow.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.960
We've had like huge growth in the last few days.

14:43.960 --> 14:45.640
We've completely redone our infrastructure.

14:45.640 --> 14:50.760
You know, we've solved massive bugs that have been there since 1.0 in the last few days.

14:50.760 --> 14:56.440
Complete stack updates, Skylake, Maxwell, Polaris support, everything's just landed.

14:56.440 --> 15:02.000
So what I've said is I would allow snaps as a secondary deployment mechanism, but never

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
as a primary.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
I think that makes sense.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
I mean, yeah.

15:05.000 --> 15:09.300
I mean, if you wanted that available, like then yes, that could be done, but I mean,

15:09.300 --> 15:12.480
as a primary mechanism, that's kind of what I'm trying to get across.

15:12.480 --> 15:13.480
Mm-hmm.

15:13.480 --> 15:14.480
Yeah.

15:14.480 --> 15:18.320
And I don't know if everyone agrees with you on that point, but I can see your perspective

15:18.320 --> 15:19.320
on it for sure.

15:19.320 --> 15:20.320
Yeah.

15:20.320 --> 15:25.800
I mean, we spoke about the difficulty of dev deployment, didn't we, before as one of the

15:25.800 --> 15:30.760
main reasons for wanting something like Snap to exist.

15:30.760 --> 15:33.880
But I mean, you've seen what we've done with this last stack of updates.

15:33.880 --> 15:38.280
That's just kind of not really possible anywhere else ever.

15:38.280 --> 15:43.480
So the way that we're built works for us, but as a secondary mechanism, yeah, I mean,

15:43.480 --> 15:44.960
I can make some exceptions.

15:44.960 --> 15:45.960
Yeah.

15:45.960 --> 15:50.400
I think at least for our case, it comes down to like sometimes you just, even if it's a

15:50.400 --> 15:53.000
little bit ugly, there are times where you just need some software.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Very practical.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Yeah.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.920
It's not about, it's about like, oh, I have to have this.

15:56.920 --> 15:57.920
Yeah.

15:57.920 --> 15:58.920
I'd really love this thing.

15:58.920 --> 15:59.920
Right now, it'll solve my problem.

15:59.920 --> 16:00.920
I'll uninstall it later and be done with it.

16:00.920 --> 16:02.080
Man, there's even apps where I'll make wine.

16:02.080 --> 16:04.040
I'll use wine as a compromise for that.

16:04.040 --> 16:05.560
And that really saves you something.

16:05.560 --> 16:11.040
What I would really do, really, really, really strongly request though, like if you started

16:11.040 --> 16:14.880
to use Snap, I'd always suggest like whatever the app is you happen to be using, just request

16:14.880 --> 16:18.800
that we put it in a repo and we make sure it's integrated natively.

16:18.800 --> 16:24.400
So do you remember we spoke before about having the maintainers between the package and the

16:24.400 --> 16:25.400
distribution, right?

16:25.400 --> 16:29.960
We just spoke about updating to GNOME 3.20.

16:29.960 --> 16:34.400
One of the first bugs I hit was actually launching GNOME calendar, which all of a sudden decided

16:34.400 --> 16:39.840
it absolutely required GNOME shell for this one particular setting, which happened to

16:39.840 --> 16:42.480
be, do I show weekdays or not?

16:42.480 --> 16:47.040
And these are the kind of bugs that come up where you need the maintainers because that

16:47.040 --> 16:49.440
could have been deployed as Snap and it's like, yeah, I don't know what I'm doing.

16:49.440 --> 16:50.440
I don't know how to run.

16:50.440 --> 16:52.200
What the hell, what?

16:52.200 --> 16:53.880
So I think that's where you need that middle ground.

16:53.880 --> 16:56.960
And at the end of the day, we would like to get things integrated better, just so they

16:56.960 --> 16:59.320
run that little bit better for solos.

16:59.320 --> 17:04.280
Like I mean, we've just integrated Golang 1.6.3, Rust 1.10.0.

17:04.280 --> 17:05.760
So you can build these things natively.

17:05.760 --> 17:08.320
You can take advantage of more updates.

17:08.320 --> 17:11.600
And you know, like if you've got an app or something, solos is, you know, we're kind

17:11.600 --> 17:15.360
of going to bend over backwards for app developers.

17:15.360 --> 17:21.200
So as an example, Budgie took something like five or six months to get into Debian after

17:21.200 --> 17:25.120
going through all the political process with Debian and Ubuntu and then getting it sponsored

17:25.120 --> 17:27.840
and monitored because that's how things roll over there.

17:27.840 --> 17:29.840
And that's the same for any new app.

17:29.840 --> 17:32.640
And solos, we kind of need the apps to be here.

17:32.640 --> 17:35.280
So we're going to make sure your app is out there.

17:35.280 --> 17:38.420
And you don't have to wait for a new major release for somebody to get your features

17:38.420 --> 17:39.920
or rely on a snap.

17:39.920 --> 17:42.660
We'll make sure it gets integrated and it's working properly.

17:42.660 --> 17:45.240
So that's kind of our value add.

17:45.240 --> 17:48.680
So having the native forms over the snap packages, it's always going to be preferable.

17:48.680 --> 17:50.260
I will definitely give you this.

17:50.260 --> 17:52.320
You know, you are catching my attention with these releases.

17:52.320 --> 17:53.320
Yeah, me too.

17:53.320 --> 17:54.560
I'm going, I'm looking at that.

17:54.560 --> 18:00.120
And Ike, I swear I was thinking of you on Saturday because I went to go fire up a game.

18:00.120 --> 18:02.760
I think it might have been Starbound, but I can't remember which one it was.

18:02.760 --> 18:06.560
And I got a bunch of Intel driver errors.

18:06.560 --> 18:08.520
That Solus runtime, man.

18:08.520 --> 18:09.520
Yeah, I know.

18:09.520 --> 18:10.520
I think about that too.

18:10.520 --> 18:11.520
That's exactly what it was.

18:11.520 --> 18:12.520
I had to go.

18:12.520 --> 18:17.100
Essentially, there's just Arch, Intel, like you really the solution was go use all your

18:17.100 --> 18:18.100
native libraries.

18:18.100 --> 18:19.720
Go get rid of the steam stuff that installs.

18:19.720 --> 18:22.480
I think we've been in the same place with it.

18:22.480 --> 18:25.360
I thought the Solus, I thought, son of a gun.

18:25.360 --> 18:28.280
Well, I've got news for you there.

18:28.280 --> 18:31.840
So you've got, yeah, I was surprised to see this turn up.

18:31.840 --> 18:36.880
So some nice soul has packaged up Linux Steam integration in the AUR.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.640
Yeah, I saw that.

18:38.640 --> 18:39.640
It doesn't install.

18:39.640 --> 18:41.280
Yeah, I forgot why it didn't install for me.

18:41.280 --> 18:42.280
There was.

18:42.280 --> 18:48.000
Okay, so you have to move your user bin steam to wherever it's configured, the steam to

18:48.000 --> 18:51.360
really exist, which is going to be like user lib steam or something like that.

18:51.360 --> 18:54.800
Take a look at the package build to see how they're configuring it, but you need to mask

18:54.800 --> 18:57.660
where the steam binary is, but then just install that.

18:57.660 --> 18:59.720
And then, you know, you'll be using LSI instead.

18:59.720 --> 19:04.600
God, I do love Arch though.

19:04.600 --> 19:05.880
This could almost be Arch's slogan.

19:05.880 --> 19:07.960
If it's great, it'll end up in Arch.

19:07.960 --> 19:12.440
Well, and I think that's where something maybe that to go back to earlier, the snaps kind

19:12.440 --> 19:17.720
of play a role, especially if people are good about asking you guys to upstream stuff.

19:17.720 --> 19:20.080
That's kind of what the AUR does for Arch is like a proving gown.

19:20.080 --> 19:21.080
How much interest is there?

19:21.080 --> 19:24.460
Wouldn't that be interesting if you could derive user interest by watching snap packages

19:24.460 --> 19:27.320
and seeing, okay, well, this is probably something we should just bring in house.

19:27.320 --> 19:28.320
Huh.

19:28.320 --> 19:29.320
Interesting.

19:29.320 --> 19:30.320
All right.

19:30.320 --> 19:32.440
So, let's take a moment and talk about snap since we've been talking.

19:32.440 --> 19:36.680
There's just been a pretty cool update, and then after we talk about this, I kind of wanted

19:36.680 --> 19:41.720
to pick Wimpy's brain because he published a snap package that I am particularly interested

19:41.720 --> 19:42.720
in.

19:42.720 --> 19:48.220
So, SnapCraft 2.13 and SnapD 2.11 landed with support for downgraded and installed snaps

19:48.220 --> 19:55.800
as well as other things like new commands, buy, try, find private, disable, refresh,

19:55.800 --> 19:57.500
and revert.

19:57.500 --> 20:01.560
These new commands let users buy various applications that are being distributed in snappy stores.

20:01.560 --> 20:05.980
Also, they obviously allow other, not just Ubuntu, but other distros to do the same thing.

20:05.980 --> 20:09.920
They also allow you to find private snaps, which I think is an interesting concept, disable

20:09.920 --> 20:14.560
installed snaps altogether as well as downgrade any snap package you've installed.

20:14.560 --> 20:19.820
Now, this is definitely turning on some of the obvious features that snaps can provide.

20:19.820 --> 20:23.360
When logged into a store, snap find dash dash private lets you see snaps that have only

20:23.360 --> 20:25.400
been shared with you.

20:25.400 --> 20:26.400
That's pretty interesting.

20:26.400 --> 20:29.360
So, snaps are getting some pretty cool updates.

20:29.360 --> 20:33.720
And I wanted to pick Wimpy's brain about one of the snaps he published recently about maybe

20:33.720 --> 20:35.120
the process, what it was like.

20:35.120 --> 20:40.920
It's called PodPublish, a tool for encoding and publishing podcast content and assets,

20:40.920 --> 20:45.480
which has been, I think, a fork of something that Stuart Langridge started a while ago.

20:45.480 --> 20:51.320
And I've seen people that work on some of our GitHub projects associated with this.

20:51.320 --> 20:56.240
Wimpy, what is PodPublish and what was the process like of creating a snap of it and

20:56.240 --> 21:00.240
then publishing it somewhere?

21:00.240 --> 21:07.800
PodPublish is a re-implementation of BV Publish that's written by Stuart Langridge for publishing

21:07.800 --> 21:09.240
the Bad Voltage podcast.

21:09.240 --> 21:15.540
And is this like a bash script or is it something beyond that or is it like a series of prompts

21:15.540 --> 21:20.000
that it asks you for information about the show and does like the tagging and encoding?

21:20.000 --> 21:25.680
No, so Stuart's was a Python implementation and I know Python, so my implementation is

21:25.680 --> 21:29.280
in Python as well.

21:29.280 --> 21:37.160
You basically have, in its simple form, you have two commands, encode podcast.

21:37.160 --> 21:41.000
And to invoke that, you point that at a configuration file.

21:41.000 --> 21:47.520
And in the configuration file, you specify the paths to your artwork and show notes in

21:47.520 --> 21:51.960
markdown and what the episode number is and all of that sort of thing.

21:51.960 --> 21:53.800
And it supports string interpolation.

21:53.800 --> 22:00.520
So you can define some sort of like global variables, if you like, in the configuration.

22:00.520 --> 22:04.320
And then they'll be inherited into the various, yeah, exactly like, yes.

22:04.320 --> 22:08.280
What does it assume is on the other end receiving this information?

22:08.280 --> 22:15.720
At the moment, it will, for the encoding process, it'll encode to OGG and MP3 and MKV, which

22:15.720 --> 22:19.320
is H264 with AAC audio.

22:19.320 --> 22:26.840
And the MKVs are specifically designed to go into YouTube with little to no reencoding

22:26.840 --> 22:27.840
on YouTube.

22:27.840 --> 22:28.840
That is nice.

22:28.840 --> 22:29.840
Good idea.

22:29.840 --> 22:30.840
So in terms of the...

22:30.840 --> 22:31.840
Yeah, go ahead.

22:31.840 --> 22:41.360
And in terms of the publishing, it will publish to SSH or SFDP using just about every authentication

22:41.360 --> 22:44.480
mechanism you can muster.

22:44.480 --> 22:51.200
And it will also publish to WordPress, it assumes PowerPress at the moment as the only

22:51.200 --> 22:52.200
backend.

22:52.200 --> 22:56.000
In fact, actually, it doesn't assume any backend at the moment, it'll publish to WordPress

22:56.000 --> 23:00.960
and also upload to YouTube.

23:00.960 --> 23:04.440
You can define in the configuration which of those you have enabled or not.

23:04.440 --> 23:09.780
So at the moment, the Ubuntu podcast YouTube channel is banned for the second time.

23:09.780 --> 23:14.320
So we have that feature disabled in our configuration file right now.

23:14.320 --> 23:17.240
How does that happen?

23:17.240 --> 23:18.560
How do we get banned?

23:18.560 --> 23:19.560
Yeah.

23:19.560 --> 23:25.200
Because we've got out of copyright theme music from 1927 that somebody claims is in copyright.

23:25.200 --> 23:27.200
Oh, here's the thing.

23:27.200 --> 23:29.320
That literally happens to me three, four times a day.

23:29.320 --> 23:31.440
So I don't understand why you got it.

23:31.440 --> 23:34.280
Yeah, it's a long, it's a long, tedious story.

23:34.280 --> 23:36.680
We uploaded a load of stuff at the end of last year.

23:36.680 --> 23:40.760
We basically uploaded the whole back catalog of every of the previous eight years.

23:40.760 --> 23:42.240
That'll do it.

23:42.240 --> 23:46.040
Yeah, and that and we got community strikes for that and then got banned.

23:46.040 --> 23:47.040
Yeah.

23:47.040 --> 23:48.200
Yeah, it doesn't take much.

23:48.200 --> 23:52.880
Then we persuaded them that we've been ignorant, but not malicious.

23:52.880 --> 23:55.040
So we were unbanned.

23:55.040 --> 24:00.640
But then we'd got a couple of strikes remaining on a few podcasts, you know, a few episodes.

24:00.640 --> 24:05.560
So I filed an appeal against one and it was successful.

24:05.560 --> 24:09.900
So I thought, brilliant, I'll just do the same appeal against the other seven.

24:09.900 --> 24:13.200
And then we got banned again, because you're not allowed to appeal more than one at a time.

24:13.200 --> 24:15.440
Yeah, isn't that a great system?

24:15.440 --> 24:16.440
Wow.

24:16.440 --> 24:21.280
And legitimately, I have, I have thought about on, you know, just sort of principle getting

24:21.280 --> 24:23.000
off of YouTube.

24:23.000 --> 24:28.400
But it really is, it really is a good platform for so many people.

24:28.400 --> 24:31.680
Like I just asked him on the Linux action show on Sunday, hey, you know, give me a comment

24:31.680 --> 24:34.680
if you watch the this entire show on YouTube, because it's not common for people to watch

24:34.680 --> 24:38.360
long shows, lots of comments from people saying they did.

24:38.360 --> 24:41.880
You know, I watched the entire show also, if you're on YouTube, thumbs up this video

24:41.880 --> 24:42.880
right here.

24:42.880 --> 24:43.880
Do it.

24:43.880 --> 24:47.040
If you if you listen or watch the entire Linux unplugged on YouTube, give it a thumbs up

24:47.040 --> 24:52.920
because what I want to demonstrate is there are a huge amount of Linux users that and

24:52.920 --> 24:58.040
there's lots of reasons I hear work blocks RSS feeds like feedburner.

24:58.040 --> 25:02.160
Oh, that's a common one that I hear is work blocks x and the only way I can get around

25:02.160 --> 25:06.680
it is I use YouTube DL or something like this to pull your show down the playlists or whatever.

25:06.680 --> 25:07.680
Yep.

25:07.680 --> 25:11.640
So there's a there's a huge percentage of people that have like deals for YouTube.

25:11.640 --> 25:14.840
Like if they watch YouTube, they get a they get it for free or they get a deal or doesn't

25:14.840 --> 25:17.640
count against their cap or even for ISPs.

25:17.640 --> 25:20.640
And so that's so there's a lot of reasons to be on YouTube.

25:20.640 --> 25:22.880
Makes it really easy to do Chromecast, that kind of stuff.

25:22.880 --> 25:23.880
Yeah.

25:23.880 --> 25:25.160
So I feel you wimpy.

25:25.160 --> 25:26.680
I'm curious about this stuff.

25:26.680 --> 25:31.640
How from just from the Python angle from like, you know, like for the virtual env or pip

25:31.640 --> 25:36.360
requirements, how is the snappy packaging gone?

25:36.360 --> 25:38.800
That was actually quite straightforward.

25:38.800 --> 25:48.920
The only complexity with snapping that application was originally the in snaps, you can stage

25:48.920 --> 25:54.640
packages and that means pull in a deb and put that in my snap because I want to use

25:54.640 --> 26:00.660
it or things that are in it and I originally staged FFmpeg and that didn't work.

26:00.660 --> 26:06.000
But now snaps have got they originally called wiki parts and I think they might be called

26:06.000 --> 26:15.360
online parts now, but a way of pulling in an existing snap source part into your snap.

26:15.360 --> 26:22.380
So now the pod publish snap actually builds FFmpeg in the specific way that's required

26:22.380 --> 26:24.480
by pod publish within the snap.

26:24.480 --> 26:30.480
So it's got its own special version of FFmpeg integrated within it.

26:30.480 --> 26:31.480
That's very interesting.

26:31.480 --> 26:35.360
So that was the only on the only sort of caveat, but it works quite well.

26:35.360 --> 26:39.440
It works better that way, actually, because you can, you know, customize it just enable

26:39.440 --> 26:44.600
those codecs that you need and keep the size of that FFmpeg implementation minimal.

26:44.600 --> 26:45.600
Yeah.

26:45.600 --> 26:51.080
OK, so what when you hear something I think we haven't figured out yet with snaps and

26:51.080 --> 26:53.720
it's probably going to be true with all the other universal application installers that

26:53.720 --> 26:57.640
may or may not come to fruition.

26:57.640 --> 26:59.680
There's there's no there's no contract.

26:59.680 --> 27:02.960
There's no there's no guarantee on updates.

27:02.960 --> 27:09.640
You know, I, for example, I'll use the snap for Telegram and then very quickly discovered

27:09.640 --> 27:12.040
that it's several releases behind.

27:12.040 --> 27:14.120
And then I realized, oh, yeah, of course.

27:14.120 --> 27:18.760
Just because I'm using a snap doesn't guarantee I'm going to get updates back to Ike's argument

27:18.760 --> 27:22.440
about just using, you know, the distro's repos or package management system.

27:22.440 --> 27:24.640
But Wimpy, what are your thoughts on that?

27:24.640 --> 27:28.680
When you publish a snap, what is sort of the implied contract there and and what are your

27:28.680 --> 27:33.080
intentions with something like with like Pod Publisher or other snaps you publish?

27:33.080 --> 27:40.160
So you talked about the new version of snap earlier, 2.13, and you mentioned the refresh

27:40.160 --> 27:41.600
command.

27:41.600 --> 27:45.560
That is the command that will update your installed snaps.

27:45.560 --> 27:48.800
But it's still incumbent upon the snap author to actually...

27:48.800 --> 27:49.800
At the...

27:49.800 --> 27:50.800
Sorry, go on.

27:50.800 --> 27:51.800
Carry on.

27:51.800 --> 27:55.980
Well, I mean, that my issue appears to be that the snap the snap authors are not updating

27:55.980 --> 27:58.480
their packages all the time.

27:58.480 --> 28:02.640
So the issue is not so much that I don't have a mechanism to update the snap is that they

28:02.640 --> 28:03.640
are not...

28:03.640 --> 28:04.640
How will you know what the schedule is?

28:04.640 --> 28:05.640
What?

28:05.640 --> 28:06.640
And what is the...

28:06.640 --> 28:07.640
There's no implied contract yet.

28:07.640 --> 28:08.760
There's no established norm.

28:08.760 --> 28:11.400
It seems like some it seems like it's just up to the whim of the...

28:11.400 --> 28:12.800
Does it follow the master branch?

28:12.800 --> 28:14.160
Does it follow stable releases?

28:14.160 --> 28:15.160
Does it follow?

28:15.160 --> 28:16.160
Yeah.

28:16.160 --> 28:17.160
Nothing at all.

28:17.160 --> 28:20.960
So the version of the snap should tell you what version it's using, whether it's, you

28:20.960 --> 28:27.560
know, tip of git or a git snapshot or a stable release version.

28:27.560 --> 28:34.080
And a lot of the snap activity that took place making snap packages that took place through

28:34.080 --> 28:41.520
the snappy playing pen initiative was lots of people making snap packages to find out

28:41.520 --> 28:49.680
where the edge cases were where it was difficult to, you know, create a snap or impossible

28:49.680 --> 28:51.680
in some cases.

28:51.680 --> 29:00.680
The product of that is to try and get those snap craft packages that were made adopted

29:00.680 --> 29:02.320
upstream.

29:02.320 --> 29:10.400
So the view of snaps is it's the upstreams that will actually maintain the snap packages

29:10.400 --> 29:16.180
and they will release snap packages in accordance with their release schedules in the same way

29:16.180 --> 29:20.080
that they release new tables, for example.

29:20.080 --> 29:21.080
I see.

29:21.080 --> 29:25.440
Like in a sense, you could have it almost integrated in with the CI systems or anything

29:25.440 --> 29:26.440
else.

29:26.440 --> 29:27.440
Yeah.

29:27.440 --> 29:28.440
Yeah, you can.

29:28.440 --> 29:29.920
I mean, everything in...

29:29.920 --> 29:30.920
I think this is true.

29:30.920 --> 29:34.640
If it's not true now, it will be.

29:34.640 --> 29:39.560
Everything in the snappy playpen is actually built in Docker containers in Travis CI, for

29:39.560 --> 29:40.560
example.

29:40.560 --> 29:45.520
So, you know, it's quite easy to hook that stuff up.

29:45.520 --> 29:47.280
I like that.

29:47.280 --> 29:52.280
I have an idea for a new show, just a really simple show kicking around in the back of

29:52.280 --> 29:56.960
my head that would probably be only an MP3 just because it'd just be for fun.

29:56.960 --> 30:01.960
And I really like the idea of installing pod publish as a snap and then using that to publish

30:01.960 --> 30:02.960
the show.

30:02.960 --> 30:09.060
So that would be a totally cool workflow to just, you know, use a snap in a way that is

30:09.060 --> 30:12.280
in a production workflow and something that would, you know, I just think it'd be a really

30:12.280 --> 30:13.280
great experience.

30:13.280 --> 30:14.640
Especially with these new updates.

30:14.640 --> 30:19.240
That's where I'm kind of curious to see how snappy snap packages get deployed to enterprises.

30:19.240 --> 30:22.080
That's one big thing where it's like, if we've deployed our new release, we really need to

30:22.080 --> 30:24.280
roll back in the next 20 minutes.

30:24.280 --> 30:26.320
And so having these kind of tools integrated in.

30:26.320 --> 30:27.320
Yeah.

30:27.320 --> 30:28.320
Yeah.

30:28.320 --> 30:30.800
You mentioned snap revert, and that's the tool that does that now.

30:30.800 --> 30:35.440
So you can manually roll back to the previous version.

30:35.440 --> 30:41.320
And it doesn't just roll back the app, it also rolls back the data for that version

30:41.320 --> 30:42.320
as well.

30:42.320 --> 30:43.320
I see.

30:43.320 --> 30:48.040
So if you've got, if you've interest in, you mean when you mean data, do you mean application

30:48.040 --> 30:49.960
settings data or do you mean user data?

30:49.960 --> 30:50.960
Yeah.

30:50.960 --> 30:51.960
Okay.

30:51.960 --> 30:52.960
Application settings data.

30:52.960 --> 30:53.960
Well, it could be both potentially.

30:53.960 --> 30:59.600
It depends how that application is, you know, whatever's in the sandbox or that sort of thing.

30:59.600 --> 31:00.600
Yeah.

31:00.600 --> 31:01.600
Okay.

31:01.600 --> 31:02.600
Okay.

31:02.600 --> 31:07.760
Wimpy, while we've got your ear, I would love to know more about what seems to be a pretty

31:07.760 --> 31:12.760
neat development and kind of makes me want one of these BQM 10 tablets even more.

31:12.760 --> 31:16.760
I saw it come across your Google Plus feed here.

31:16.760 --> 31:23.200
This to me, and I'm, you know, just looking on Google Plus, but it looks like Ubuntu Mate

31:23.200 --> 31:28.360
running on the BQM 10 tablet full on touch and everything.

31:28.360 --> 31:33.120
But that couldn't be, that couldn't be because this is the Mate desktop and et cetera, et

31:33.120 --> 31:34.120
cetera.

31:34.120 --> 31:37.280
Yes, it is exactly that.

31:37.280 --> 31:45.120
So like all of the best developments in Ubuntu Mate, this came from the community.

31:45.120 --> 31:51.360
It came from a guy called Marius Quebec, I hope I'm pronouncing your name correctly.

31:51.360 --> 31:56.880
And he had worked with somebody else to come up with the basic principle of how to get

31:56.880 --> 31:58.280
this going.

31:58.280 --> 32:03.820
And he posted on G Plus and I saw it and said, please document how you did this because I'd

32:03.820 --> 32:06.440
be interested in taking a look.

32:06.440 --> 32:11.320
So a few days later, he pings me and sends me a document on how we did it.

32:11.320 --> 32:15.560
And then I looked at that and then started to think about how it could be refined a little

32:15.560 --> 32:18.480
bit because, you know, that's what I do.

32:18.480 --> 32:21.740
You know, when we had the first Raspberry Pi version, I took a look at that and figured

32:21.740 --> 32:26.280
out how it could be slightly improved and the same with the power PC port and so on.

32:26.280 --> 32:28.800
So I've taken a look at what Marius has done.

32:28.800 --> 32:36.080
And essentially the way that he's done this is to take the Xenial pre-install image of

32:36.080 --> 32:47.320
Unity 8, stick that into a CH root on the BQM 10, bind mount the relevant places, launch

32:47.320 --> 32:55.200
Exmere and then spawn the, oh, and then what he does is he then installs the Ubuntu Mate

32:55.200 --> 33:02.040
Core meta package over the top of the Unity 8 CH root and then spawns the Mate session

33:02.040 --> 33:04.640
into that Exmere window.

33:04.640 --> 33:09.400
So and it works, you know, touch works and you can rotate the screen and the screen resizes

33:09.400 --> 33:13.600
and it does all the things you'd expect it to do.

33:13.600 --> 33:18.440
And you know, you've got things like Firefox pre-installed, which actually work very well.

33:18.440 --> 33:24.360
Curiously, it seems to work better than the version of Firefox that's shipped along with

33:24.360 --> 33:25.360
the M10.

33:25.360 --> 33:29.200
I haven't quite figured out why that can be the case, but it appears to be.

33:29.200 --> 33:34.500
So because I've done the work with the Raspberry Pi images, I've got a build system for making

33:34.500 --> 33:37.440
root file systems for RMHF.

33:37.440 --> 33:43.360
So I've been tinkering with that so that instead of having to put the Unity 8 image on and

33:43.360 --> 33:53.360
then install some extra stuff into it, I've made just a Mate core root file system that

33:53.360 --> 33:55.840
you can just extract directly and use that directly.

33:55.840 --> 34:01.140
And I'm just trying to clean up some of the rough edges and find out how to integrate

34:01.140 --> 34:04.560
it a little bit more seamlessly because it requires a little bit of hackery in order

34:04.560 --> 34:09.040
to sort of put the scaffolding up for XMirror and then run the session.

34:09.040 --> 34:13.120
You have to do it all through the phablet shell and I'm trying to find a way to do it

34:13.120 --> 34:17.480
directly on the tablet so you can just have a launcher icon, click it and it starts.

34:17.480 --> 34:18.480
Here's my use...

34:18.480 --> 34:19.480
Oh, go ahead.

34:19.480 --> 34:25.800
Oh, maybe you're about to say it because I think my use case fantasy for this is not

34:25.800 --> 34:31.120
so much in full on tablet mode, although that sounds useful when I need something quickly

34:31.120 --> 34:32.480
and I'm on the go.

34:32.480 --> 34:38.120
But to me, what feels like the real ace in the hole use case for this would be I connect

34:38.120 --> 34:44.440
it to an HDMI hookup and a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse and now I'm using the Mate desktop

34:44.440 --> 34:50.600
on a lower end resources machine on a large screen that has, you know, perhaps a better

34:50.600 --> 34:51.600
response time.

34:51.600 --> 34:52.600
But I don't know.

34:52.600 --> 34:53.760
I mean, what is the use case here?

34:53.760 --> 34:54.760
Because this seems...

34:54.760 --> 34:57.400
It seems at first like not...

34:57.400 --> 35:02.560
It seems like Ubuntu Mate is not itself lended, as you might say, to a touch environment.

35:02.560 --> 35:06.440
It is not necessarily the one I think of when I think of a touch screen experience.

35:06.440 --> 35:08.600
No, it's not.

35:08.600 --> 35:14.800
I mean, you can do a surprising amount actually by touching the screen on Mate and in Mate

35:14.800 --> 35:22.240
1.4 we added some new features so you can make the menu icon sizes and the panel icon

35:22.240 --> 35:28.120
sizes much, much bigger without changing the DPI of the whole UI so you can actually make

35:28.120 --> 35:29.920
those a little bit more touch friendly.

35:29.920 --> 35:32.800
Honestly, myself, I would absolutely...

35:32.800 --> 35:38.640
Even if there was, let's just say, a compromise in some of the usability in a touch experience,

35:38.640 --> 35:42.960
if it meant it was a useful practical desktop experience and then I could have the same

35:42.960 --> 35:46.840
information and the same state when I'm on the go and when I'm hooked up to a...

35:46.840 --> 35:47.840
The same state.

35:47.840 --> 35:49.160
That's really what it is.

35:49.160 --> 35:55.560
If I have notes in gedit when I'm plugged into my desktop when I'm at the client's desk

35:55.560 --> 35:59.120
sitting down trying to remember what it was or when I'm at work trying to remember that

35:59.120 --> 36:04.560
great idea I had for the show, that same gedit doc is still up on the screen.

36:04.560 --> 36:12.220
So what's important to understand here, this is not Ubuntu Mate running on the tablet instead

36:12.220 --> 36:14.100
of Ubuntu Touch.

36:14.100 --> 36:16.440
It's like running inside Ubuntu Touch, right?

36:16.440 --> 36:25.800
It's running inside a CH root inside Ubuntu Touch and it's effectively like a full screen

36:25.800 --> 36:26.800
app.

36:26.800 --> 36:34.680
So you can still swipe in and switch to the native touch apps, but you can go back to

36:34.680 --> 36:40.000
it as it is its desktop and it will work with Bluetooth mice and keyboards and all the rest

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
of it.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.840
Is there a performance penalty there?

36:42.840 --> 36:43.840
There doesn't seem to be.

36:43.840 --> 36:52.360
It's running extremely well and because it's running in a CH root, you've got apt so you

36:52.360 --> 37:01.240
can apt install those applications that you want into that CH root to add the functionality

37:01.240 --> 37:11.000
or application richness that might currently be missing from the Ubuntu Touch ecosystem.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.880
All kinds of tools I could think of.

37:12.880 --> 37:13.880
Absolutely.

37:13.880 --> 37:14.880
Hmm.

37:14.880 --> 37:15.880
That's neat.

37:15.880 --> 37:21.880
So Wimpy, in your estimation, what's sort of the fundamental thing that made this possible?

37:21.880 --> 37:27.040
Is it once you get Ubuntu on a device like this, you can sort of just build out from

37:27.040 --> 37:28.040
there?

37:28.040 --> 37:29.400
Was there something else that made it?

37:29.400 --> 37:31.600
Was it a firmware thing?

37:31.600 --> 37:36.320
What was the quote unquote enabling technology for this?

37:36.320 --> 37:37.320
It's two things.

37:37.320 --> 37:39.520
It's Ubuntu and Exmere.

37:39.520 --> 37:42.400
Right because this is running under Exmere, isn't it?

37:42.400 --> 37:43.400
Yeah.

37:43.400 --> 37:46.880
The whole that whole desktop environment is rendered with Exmere.

37:46.880 --> 37:49.080
And the performance is still pretty solid.

37:49.080 --> 37:50.080
It's great.

37:50.080 --> 37:51.080
Boy, that's...

37:51.080 --> 37:52.080
See, that's exciting.

37:52.080 --> 37:53.080
Mm hmm.

37:53.080 --> 37:54.080
Good.

37:54.080 --> 37:55.080
Well, look at that.

37:55.080 --> 37:56.080
And, and it's...

37:56.080 --> 38:00.680
So there's there's quite a bit of refinement to make this a thing that people can use trivially.

38:00.680 --> 38:04.640
I mean, it's fairly trivial to use if you're comfortable with the shell, but at the moment,

38:04.640 --> 38:09.480
you have to have a computer hooked up to the tablet in order to, you know, bootstrap it

38:09.480 --> 38:10.480
all.

38:10.480 --> 38:11.480
I see.

38:11.480 --> 38:14.800
You have to have a computer around that so you can bootstrap it from the tablet directly.

38:14.800 --> 38:16.840
From the tablet without an external Linux system.

38:16.840 --> 38:17.840
Exactly.

38:17.840 --> 38:19.520
That is going to be something the iPad could never do.

38:19.520 --> 38:20.520
No, right?

38:20.520 --> 38:21.520
Like that's a fundamental...

38:21.520 --> 38:22.520
Yeah.

38:22.520 --> 38:25.120
And it doesn't have to be, you know, Ubuntu Mate.

38:25.120 --> 38:26.640
That's obviously what I'm interested in.

38:26.640 --> 38:32.880
It could be Zubuntu, Lubuntu, Kubuntu, Ubuntu Unity, Ubuntu GNOME.

38:32.880 --> 38:35.080
You know, all of those will do it too.

38:35.080 --> 38:36.080
Hmm.

38:36.080 --> 38:38.440
Well, that sounds super awesome.

38:38.440 --> 38:40.520
Now picture it, friends.

38:40.520 --> 38:41.520
Picture it.

38:41.520 --> 38:45.320
You take a BQ tablet like that and you combine it with a data connection from Ting.

38:45.320 --> 38:46.320
Oh, I know.

38:46.320 --> 38:47.320
I know.

38:47.320 --> 38:51.920
It sounds impossible, but friends, it is possible and it just got better than ever.

38:51.920 --> 38:57.080
In fact, if you go to linux.ting.com, you support the show and you get a little money

38:57.080 --> 38:58.080
off your first Ting device.

38:58.080 --> 38:59.080
Yeah, yeah.

38:59.080 --> 39:00.080
In fact, if you...

39:00.080 --> 39:01.080
You know, here's another thing.

39:01.080 --> 39:05.480
If you bring a Ting device, something when I say a Ting device, that's just a GSM or

39:05.480 --> 39:08.440
CDMA device that's compatible with Ting's network options.

39:08.440 --> 39:11.040
They got a page that tells you all about that.

39:11.040 --> 39:15.680
They give you a $25 credit, average first month, or actually every month if you just

39:15.680 --> 39:16.680
have one device, $23.

39:16.680 --> 39:17.680
What?

39:17.680 --> 39:21.000
So the $25 credit is kind of a nice thing too if you already have a device.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.640
But I want you to wrap your head around this.

39:23.640 --> 39:32.920
Ting is just pay for what you use wireless, $6 for the line plus Uncle Sam's take and

39:32.920 --> 39:34.920
then you just pay for what you use.

39:34.920 --> 39:38.440
And the price for pay for what you use just got even better.

39:38.440 --> 39:42.960
In fact, our friend Kyra is here to tell us all about it.

39:42.960 --> 39:45.220
Data is now cheaper on Ting.

39:45.220 --> 39:47.800
From now on, prices look like this.

39:47.800 --> 39:49.400
Need more?

39:49.400 --> 39:51.200
It's just $10 a gig.

39:51.200 --> 39:52.960
That's what new customers pay.

39:52.960 --> 39:54.840
That's what current customers pay.

39:54.840 --> 39:55.840
It's simple.

39:55.840 --> 39:56.840
We like simple.

39:56.840 --> 40:00.040
See for yourself at ting.com slash rates.

40:00.040 --> 40:03.400
You know what I hear the most though from people that switch to Ting after hearing our

40:03.400 --> 40:04.400
spots?

40:04.400 --> 40:10.880
Well, you wouldn't guess because I mean, I guess I do hear quite a bit OMG, I saved a

40:10.880 --> 40:11.880
ton of money.

40:11.880 --> 40:15.560
I can't believe I do hear that a lot, especially from folks that are small businesses.

40:15.560 --> 40:21.440
But the surprising one is the is the stories I hear about the experiences with their customer

40:21.440 --> 40:22.440
service.

40:22.440 --> 40:27.640
So they have really good customer service and I get emails and tweets in a lot.

40:27.640 --> 40:31.280
In fact, in fact, if you want to send those in, keep sending them and go to the general

40:31.280 --> 40:33.520
comments and keep sending them in because people have been doing that.

40:33.520 --> 40:36.840
I haven't really been soliciting this, but keep doing it.

40:36.840 --> 40:40.480
And if you want to take a picture of the note or something that somebody from Ting sends

40:40.480 --> 40:41.480
you, please do.

40:41.480 --> 40:45.160
Like people are getting personalized and I'm not shitting you here.

40:45.160 --> 40:50.600
People are getting personalized gifts from the Ting support.

40:50.600 --> 40:54.980
Like little notes, little notes or like a little card or something like that.

40:54.980 --> 40:57.840
And it's just it's blowing people's minds and it's, you know, it's I don't know if it's

40:57.840 --> 41:00.360
something they do all the time or if it's just something they do from time to time.

41:00.360 --> 41:02.520
I mean, nothing is like the Ting customer service.

41:02.520 --> 41:05.840
You call them, you talk to a real human being and there's no BS.

41:05.840 --> 41:07.280
They stick with you through a problem.

41:07.280 --> 41:09.360
Let me tell you, I can testify to that.

41:09.360 --> 41:13.240
The one time in over two and a half years I've used Ting, the one time I had to call

41:13.240 --> 41:17.100
in was when I was doing the road trip to Noah's house and I don't know, I was in Montana or

41:17.100 --> 41:21.600
some some crazy backward place and no offense, Montana.

41:21.600 --> 41:26.880
And the Ting rep literally stayed on the phone with me for over an hour as we worked through

41:26.880 --> 41:33.160
all kinds of bad connectivity problems with the CDMA network and none of it was Ting's

41:33.160 --> 41:34.160
fault.

41:34.160 --> 41:36.560
And they still stuck with me till the end to make sure it all got working.

41:36.560 --> 41:39.520
They could have punted at any moment and they didn't.

41:39.520 --> 41:42.880
They have tons of nice devices you can buy directly, all of them unlocked.

41:42.880 --> 41:45.760
You own them outright or you can bring your own or just buy it directly from the Play

41:45.760 --> 41:46.760
Store.

41:46.760 --> 41:51.800
Check them out at Linux.Ting.com.

41:51.800 --> 41:54.840
You want to go get a line for your tablet and only pay for the data when you have to

41:54.840 --> 41:56.200
go off Wi-Fi from time to time?

41:56.200 --> 41:57.200
Exactly.

41:57.200 --> 41:58.200
Ting is a great option.

41:58.200 --> 42:01.000
Linux.Ting.com.

42:01.000 --> 42:05.680
So I want to just take a real quick moment to mention that the Humble Bundle Survive

42:05.680 --> 42:06.840
This Bundle is out.

42:06.840 --> 42:08.280
The Humble Survive This Bundle, I guess.

42:08.280 --> 42:09.280
Oh, this looks great.

42:09.280 --> 42:12.960
Yeah, and it is nice because they've got three actual games, which is somewhat progress.

42:12.960 --> 42:16.960
Although all the ones I'm interested in, like this first one and this one that looks like

42:16.960 --> 42:21.280
it's a Mars one, not available for Linux because apparently they hate me.

42:21.280 --> 42:26.240
But there are a couple of good ones like Rust, Early Access, available for Linux.

42:26.240 --> 42:28.520
I think this Colot one looks kind of interesting.

42:28.520 --> 42:29.520
Tell me about it.

42:29.520 --> 42:30.520
Colot?

42:30.520 --> 42:31.520
Yeah, I actually haven't looked at the game.

42:31.520 --> 42:35.440
I remember looking at it during the Steam sale, but it's narrated by Sean Bean.

42:35.440 --> 42:38.040
It's an exploration adventure game, so you kind of have to be into more of that, like

42:38.040 --> 42:41.840
a little slower paced, a little creepy, you know, kind of just going around.

42:41.840 --> 42:46.220
But actually it follows this like really kind of creepy incident where a bunch of graduate

42:46.220 --> 42:48.480
students died hiking this mountain.

42:48.480 --> 42:49.480
Have you seen Rust?

42:49.480 --> 42:50.480
Yeah, Rust looks fun too.

42:50.480 --> 42:53.640
Yeah, it does.

42:53.640 --> 42:57.520
And that's almost worth the price of admission right there if you don't have it already.

42:57.520 --> 42:59.080
Especially it's nice to get a DRM free version.

42:59.080 --> 43:00.080
It's not-

43:00.080 --> 43:01.800
And when you give to the Humble Bundle, you can feel good about it.

43:01.800 --> 43:04.080
Yeah, plus it's nice to see Linux stats on there.

43:04.080 --> 43:05.400
Just saying, just saying.

43:05.400 --> 43:08.640
But yeah, I would love to see all of the games.

43:08.640 --> 43:09.640
All of the games.

43:09.640 --> 43:11.800
Also, they have a discount on the Humble Monthly.

43:11.800 --> 43:18.280
All right, I was teasing it earlier, and this is a little embarrassing to show on air because

43:18.280 --> 43:19.400
I don't know what happened.

43:19.400 --> 43:20.880
You know, Dustin, I like him.

43:20.880 --> 43:21.880
You know, I've met Dustin.

43:21.880 --> 43:23.360
He probably doesn't remember because it was years ago.

43:23.360 --> 43:26.280
But I met him at, I think it was Ubicon or something like that.

43:26.280 --> 43:33.120
And I just don't know about this picture of him over on linux.com.

43:33.120 --> 43:38.040
It's like a picture for you, those of you listening, it's all inverted.

43:38.040 --> 43:40.440
So what's black is white, and what's white is black.

43:40.440 --> 43:42.340
And then they have the tux.

43:42.340 --> 43:46.000
They have Dustin wearing a overcoat, which he either-

43:46.000 --> 43:50.040
And then like a weird blue-green glowing skin tone.

43:50.040 --> 43:55.760
Which he either sent them a picture of him like that, or he took it just for this, or

43:55.760 --> 43:56.760
they shopped it.

43:56.760 --> 44:00.280
Does it not look, just a little bit, kind of look like he might be offering you like

44:00.280 --> 44:02.840
on the cheap organs in an alleyway somewhere?

44:02.840 --> 44:07.800
In a futuristic like sci-fi post-apocalyptic like nuke war kind of movie?

44:07.800 --> 44:08.800
Yes, it does.

44:08.800 --> 44:09.800
New Noosepleen, sir.

44:09.800 --> 44:11.520
Yes, it does.

44:11.520 --> 44:16.160
So that said, he is rocking a bitchin' beard in that photo and reppin' that.

44:16.160 --> 44:20.680
So pretty much, I'm not even joking, the beard makes the entire photo work, doesn't it?

44:20.680 --> 44:21.680
It really does.

44:21.680 --> 44:23.320
If it wasn't for that beard, that photo would suck.

44:23.320 --> 44:24.680
But Tux needs a beard too.

44:24.680 --> 44:29.240
Quite literally, the beard in that photo saves the rest of it because he's almost got a,

44:29.240 --> 44:32.560
I mean I'm just, I'm getting wafts of Chuck Norris.

44:32.560 --> 44:33.560
Yeah, you are.

44:33.560 --> 44:36.160
Oh man, without the beard here, it would be very different.

44:36.160 --> 44:39.520
Right, but with the beard and that jacket, I am getting wafts of Norris.

44:39.520 --> 44:40.800
And then all of a sudden it's gotten my attention.

44:40.800 --> 44:42.960
Oh, it also has the shitty Windows logo on there.

44:42.960 --> 44:49.640
Anyways, if you scroll down, he talks about benchmarking Ubuntu under Windows versus Ubuntu

44:49.640 --> 44:50.640
native.

44:50.640 --> 44:57.440
And he's doing it on the Lenovo X250 with an Intel i7 5600 CPU, 16 gigabytes of random

44:57.440 --> 45:06.600
access memory, and 512 gigabytes of transcend SSD and a two terabyte Samsung SSD.

45:06.600 --> 45:11.800
So this is, in perhaps the kid's parlance, a hell of a machine.

45:11.800 --> 45:15.340
And he's using sysbench for a lot of these, and what's nice is he just gives you the commands

45:15.340 --> 45:16.340
to reproduce.

45:16.340 --> 45:17.340
Yeah, it is really nice.

45:17.340 --> 45:19.760
Yeah, you can just go on your machine and do this yourself.

45:19.760 --> 45:22.440
Anyways, he had some interesting tests.

45:22.440 --> 45:28.200
He wanted to nail the CPU, he wanted to check disk I.O., network performance, and of course

45:28.200 --> 45:31.920
you've got to do the classic, he built the Linux kernel.

45:31.920 --> 45:34.300
You've got to do that, that's required.

45:34.300 --> 45:39.080
And so when he starts with the CPU benchmark, he said that he saw almost identical results

45:39.080 --> 45:42.040
between Ubuntu native and Ubuntu under Windows.

45:42.040 --> 45:46.480
It took basically 2.8 seconds to run 10,000 CPU instructions.

45:46.480 --> 45:48.440
Not bad.

45:48.440 --> 45:51.800
But I want to move on to the memory benchmark, because this is where things got interesting.

45:51.800 --> 45:54.680
So he's going to move 100 gigabytes of data through memory.

45:54.680 --> 46:03.300
Native Ubuntu was able to move data through memory at 4,235 megabytes a second.

46:03.300 --> 46:09.720
Ubuntu on Windows was able to do it at 2,309 megabytes a second, so two gigabytes versus

46:09.720 --> 46:11.480
four gigabytes.

46:11.480 --> 46:13.360
That's a second, that's a huge difference.

46:13.360 --> 46:16.680
This difference exposes a bit, not only the difference in I.O. performance between the

46:16.680 --> 46:23.800
two systems, but also the overhead involved with Ubuntu under Windows.

46:23.800 --> 46:27.000
So then another interesting look here was disk performance.

46:27.000 --> 46:34.420
He says we're writing one gig file with just nothing but zeros synchroously to the disk.

46:34.420 --> 46:40.560
Native Ubuntu yields about 147 megabytes average write speed to the disk.

46:40.560 --> 46:47.020
Ubuntu under Windows manages to get 248 megabytes.

46:47.020 --> 46:54.320
So a difference of 147 under native Ubuntu, 248 megabytes under Windows.

46:54.320 --> 46:55.520
A massive difference!

46:55.520 --> 46:56.520
How is this possible?

46:56.520 --> 46:58.440
Well, it's a bit of trickery on Windows.

46:58.440 --> 47:02.800
The flag that we're sending the DD command, the desync command, which is supposed to guarantee

47:02.800 --> 47:08.120
synchronous writes to disk, ensuring that every single byte is in fact written to disk

47:08.120 --> 47:12.540
and not cached in a buffer memory, you know, kind of cheating the throughput.

47:12.540 --> 47:16.500
That same flag was used on both the Windows and the Ubuntu machines, but it seems the

47:16.500 --> 47:20.760
implementation of Ubuntu under Windows does not yet quite support that.

47:20.760 --> 47:24.880
And you got to wonder about that, like in how many cases they're like, you know, there's

47:24.880 --> 47:27.120
a lot of stuff, things to implement in that layer.

47:27.120 --> 47:30.740
So it makes sense that not everything is bit perfect.

47:30.740 --> 47:33.920
And yeah, and that's a there's a big translation probably happening there.

47:33.920 --> 47:37.160
Network throughput, specifically testing TCP bandwidth using IP perf.

47:37.160 --> 47:43.480
The native Ubuntu machine averaged 935 megabits, while Ubuntu on Windows an average of 805

47:43.480 --> 47:44.480
megabits.

47:44.480 --> 47:46.700
A noticeable reduction there.

47:46.700 --> 47:50.400
But the one we've all been waiting for, the Linux kernel compilation test.

47:50.400 --> 47:57.440
The native Ubuntu build took five minutes, 38 seconds, while Ubuntu on Windows took eight

47:57.440 --> 48:01.240
minutes and 47 seconds.

48:01.240 --> 48:02.680
I don't want to wait that long.

48:02.680 --> 48:03.680
No, no.

48:03.680 --> 48:08.720
It's suggested, by the way, this is, remember, I mentioned this earlier.

48:08.720 --> 48:14.160
So Dustin contacted some folks at Microsoft, and you know what their response was?

48:14.160 --> 48:15.160
What?

48:15.160 --> 48:23.960
I know we turn this on by default, but you might want to disable Windows Defender.

48:23.960 --> 48:24.960
No way.

48:24.960 --> 48:25.960
Yeah.

48:25.960 --> 48:26.960
Yeah.

48:26.960 --> 48:27.960
Yeah.

48:27.960 --> 48:28.960
Really?

48:28.960 --> 48:29.960
Wow.

48:29.960 --> 48:30.960
Yeah.

48:30.960 --> 48:31.960
So now he didn't have time to try it.

48:31.960 --> 48:33.920
But that does that seems to be anyone else.

48:33.920 --> 48:35.920
If anyone has a has this redstone.

48:35.920 --> 48:36.920
Yeah.

48:36.920 --> 48:37.920
They could try it.

48:37.920 --> 48:38.920
Stuff built in.

48:38.920 --> 48:39.920
Yeah.

48:39.920 --> 48:40.920
Get back to us about it.

48:40.920 --> 48:44.680
So he concludes from a performance perspective, CPU and network bound processes will perform

48:44.680 --> 48:49.760
nearly identical in Ubuntu on Windows as native Ubuntu on bare metal would.

48:49.760 --> 48:56.080
For heavily cached disk IO operations, Ubuntu on Windows might even outperform native Ubuntu

48:56.080 --> 48:57.880
on bare metal.

48:57.880 --> 49:02.240
But for heavily randomized reads and writes and memory heavy operations, Ubuntu on Windows

49:02.240 --> 49:07.400
does introduce a bit of overhead that might be noticeable in some workloads.

49:07.400 --> 49:08.400
Pretty cool test.

49:08.400 --> 49:13.160
It is kind of an interesting, even though you introduced this translation layer, it's

49:13.160 --> 49:17.640
kind of an interesting way now where you can benchmark a Windows system or a Linux system

49:17.640 --> 49:22.360
and then use the very same tool regardless of it actually supports Windows or not and

49:22.360 --> 49:23.360
run the same benchmark.

49:23.360 --> 49:24.360
So that's kind of interesting.

49:24.360 --> 49:25.360
Yeah.

49:25.360 --> 49:30.600
And, you know, it really does also speak to the to the rather awesome technical implementation

49:30.600 --> 49:33.280
that the Windows subsystem folks have done here.

49:33.280 --> 49:36.000
I mean, that's pretty impressive.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.120
It's damn near a wine quality, you might say.

49:38.120 --> 49:41.320
Also it's probably a lot easier now you have Windows you want to I mean, you want to install

49:41.320 --> 49:45.600
Linux, but you're kind of a purist and you want your own custom compiled kernel.

49:45.600 --> 49:47.640
Makes it a lot easier to do that, too.

49:47.640 --> 49:51.120
I want to continue to follow with like a remote distance.

49:51.120 --> 49:53.560
Like I'm not going to install Windows 10 and try it.

49:53.560 --> 49:54.560
Right.

49:54.560 --> 49:55.560
We're not hosting the show from Linux.

49:55.560 --> 49:57.080
No, I'm not that motivated.

49:57.080 --> 50:01.400
But I will watch as things drive by me and I'll go, oh, that's interesting.

50:01.400 --> 50:02.400
OK, I'll note that.

50:02.400 --> 50:06.120
I do see a lot of excitement from like the people who use Linux professionally because

50:06.120 --> 50:09.980
they have to deploy to servers, but like aren't they're not they're not watching the show.

50:09.980 --> 50:11.360
They're not Linux enthusiasts.

50:11.360 --> 50:14.520
And there seems to be a lot of excitement there, just like, oh, I don't have to use

50:14.520 --> 50:15.520
a Mac.

50:15.520 --> 50:16.520
It's a nice feature.

50:16.520 --> 50:17.520
I don't have to install Cygwin.

50:17.520 --> 50:18.520
Yeah.

50:18.520 --> 50:21.160
You know, Rekai, editor of the show, and much more.

50:21.160 --> 50:23.920
The beard ended up breaking down and taking advantage of the free upgrade.

50:23.920 --> 50:24.920
I understand.

50:24.920 --> 50:25.920
I understand Rekai.

50:25.920 --> 50:28.120
I only slightly judge you.

50:28.120 --> 50:31.920
And he went ahead and installed the Ubuntu subsystem.

50:31.920 --> 50:39.760
And you know, it is the only the only thing I can the only way I can describe it as is

50:39.760 --> 50:41.140
it's unnerving.

50:41.140 --> 50:45.800
It's unnerving to all of a sudden see him using Linux commands in what is clearly a

50:45.800 --> 50:46.800
Windows box.

50:46.800 --> 50:47.800
See, that is weird.

50:47.800 --> 50:50.560
It's like, oh, that's not LS.

50:50.560 --> 50:51.560
That's not right.

50:51.560 --> 50:52.560
You mean dir.

50:52.560 --> 50:53.560
Yeah.

50:53.560 --> 50:54.560
You mean dir.

50:54.560 --> 50:58.880
Wimpy, can we go back to full bandwidth here for a second, full spectrum wireless bandwidth?

50:58.880 --> 51:03.000
And can you chime in a little bit for the folks over here in the US that might not have

51:03.000 --> 51:07.320
heard about it or those that missed out on what the heck FOSStalk is and how the hell

51:07.320 --> 51:08.320
it went?

51:08.320 --> 51:14.120
Because I listened to the Ubuntu podcast and it sounded like a pretty fun event.

51:14.120 --> 51:20.820
Yeah, so FOSStalk, it was the first event.

51:20.820 --> 51:24.680
It was organized by Joe Ressington from the Linux Luddites.

51:24.680 --> 51:30.240
I happen to know Joe is trying to fall asleep at the moment with one earphone plugged in.

51:30.240 --> 51:34.600
So if you can just pan me left to right a few times, I know that'll irritate him insanely

51:34.600 --> 51:36.840
and wake him up.

51:36.840 --> 51:38.760
So yeah, Joe Joe organized the event.

51:38.760 --> 51:42.720
It was this Saturday just gone.

51:42.720 --> 51:46.520
It was a small, small event.

51:46.520 --> 51:53.640
Joe wanted to make sure that, you know, it was small enough that if lots of people didn't

51:53.640 --> 51:58.400
turn up who'd said they were going to turn up, it wouldn't look, you know, like it was

51:58.400 --> 51:59.400
a complete disaster.

51:59.400 --> 52:03.640
As it turns out, I think pretty much everyone that requested a ticket turned up.

52:03.640 --> 52:07.880
So there's about 50 people at this event.

52:07.880 --> 52:11.240
It was at a pub in London.

52:11.240 --> 52:17.080
So it was a gastro pub, so good food, good beer on the ground floor.

52:17.080 --> 52:23.800
There was a small hotel above it and then a basement venue where the event itself took

52:23.800 --> 52:25.600
place.

52:25.600 --> 52:30.640
And we had the Linux Luddites do a 45 minute show.

52:30.640 --> 52:35.760
The Aventive Podcast, we did one, and then Linux Voice did a podcast.

52:35.760 --> 52:42.000
And then there was what was billed as the drunken mashup as the last show of the evening,

52:42.000 --> 52:49.320
which was Joe and Stuart Langridge and Dave Meckerslippers from Geek News Radio, and a

52:49.320 --> 52:55.040
lot of heckling from the audience by that time of night with the intake of beverages.

52:55.040 --> 53:01.400
So yeah, four 45 minute podcasts with a half hour in between, an hour and a half or so

53:01.400 --> 53:06.840
beforehand for drinks and chatting, and then late night drinking at another venue around

53:06.840 --> 53:07.840
the corner afterwards.

53:07.840 --> 53:17.200
So it was basically a big social gathering with some podcasts going on to keep people

53:17.200 --> 53:18.200
entertained.

53:18.200 --> 53:19.760
That that's a nice way to describe it.

53:19.760 --> 53:20.760
I like that atmosphere.

53:20.760 --> 53:26.560
You know, it makes me want to I just I want to go like, let's do this here in the States.

53:26.560 --> 53:31.120
Let's figure out a time after scale or some some other Linux fest or something like that.

53:31.120 --> 53:34.800
And let's just do one of these here because that's oh, man, that seems cool.

53:34.800 --> 53:35.800
Yeah.

53:35.800 --> 53:37.120
I wish you guys would have streamed it live.

53:37.120 --> 53:38.120
If I could.

53:38.120 --> 53:39.120
I would have watched that.

53:39.120 --> 53:40.120
Yeah.

53:40.120 --> 53:41.120
Or even listen.

53:41.120 --> 53:43.480
I listen to I know that but you actually overall the audio turned out pretty good.

53:43.480 --> 53:47.400
So I got to give Joe Joe knows what he's doing.

53:47.400 --> 53:48.640
I was Joe's roadie.

53:48.640 --> 53:53.440
So he just pointed at cables and told me what to do and I got on with it.

53:53.440 --> 53:58.320
But yeah, I think I think the idea was to keep it as simple as possible this first time

53:58.320 --> 54:00.080
round.

54:00.080 --> 54:03.600
And yeah, and maybe there'll be another event.

54:03.600 --> 54:07.640
I think the aspiration is definitely for there to be another one or this is the first of

54:07.640 --> 54:14.240
many who knows the life the scope and scale will increase over time good, good approach

54:14.240 --> 54:19.600
really very good approach because there's nothing like doing a live performance doing

54:19.600 --> 54:24.480
it doing something that you normally have recorded in a in a setting where you're comfortable

54:24.480 --> 54:28.600
you have everything you need your notes, you have time to collect your thoughts.

54:28.600 --> 54:32.480
You're often in a room by yourself when you're podcasting right.

54:32.480 --> 54:37.320
And to take what has been and you do that for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks and

54:37.320 --> 54:40.680
weeks and weeks and weeks sometimes years and years and years and all of a sudden you

54:40.680 --> 54:42.760
do it in the same room with people.

54:42.760 --> 54:46.320
So not only you not normally record looking at these people, but there's also a whole

54:46.320 --> 54:51.120
bunch of other people there that are looking at you and you're always performing the performance

54:51.120 --> 54:52.120
never stops.

54:52.120 --> 54:54.640
I know downtown and there's nobody there.

54:54.640 --> 54:55.640
Right.

54:55.640 --> 54:57.080
There's no editing out that pause.

54:57.080 --> 54:59.880
So what was that like for you, Wimpy?

54:59.880 --> 55:00.880
It was good fun.

55:00.880 --> 55:01.880
Yeah.

55:01.880 --> 55:02.880
Yeah.

55:02.880 --> 55:03.880
Yeah.

55:03.880 --> 55:07.640
Joe Joe's actually telegramming me as we're talking he said that someone said to him that

55:07.640 --> 55:12.580
that Fostalk was like the best bits of odd camp, but in one evening, which is a glowing

55:12.580 --> 55:17.440
endorsement and it really was it was basically a condensed version of the social track of

55:17.440 --> 55:22.840
odd camp with many of the odd campers in attendance.

55:22.840 --> 55:26.840
Not all of them because it was obviously in London and all campus typically in the north

55:26.840 --> 55:27.840
of England.

55:27.840 --> 55:30.320
So we didn't have the full spread.

55:30.320 --> 55:33.760
But yeah, the event venue is very small.

55:33.760 --> 55:40.400
So we were only about three or four feet from the front row of the audience so you can see

55:40.400 --> 55:46.360
the whites of people's eyes and you you could very definitely tell whether or not things

55:46.360 --> 55:49.280
are going going well or not.

55:49.280 --> 55:52.800
Thankfully it seems to go well just like with music where it's like it's a whole different

55:52.800 --> 55:56.760
thing for the performer but also for the audience that kind of live interaction you really feel

55:56.760 --> 55:59.440
much more close much more engaged with the presenter.

55:59.440 --> 56:02.240
Basically you never live up to what people expect by listening to you.

56:02.240 --> 56:05.800
It's just it's it's a winning it's a never winning thing it's.

56:05.800 --> 56:10.280
So there's that initial awkward moment where they know you they have heard you they know

56:10.280 --> 56:16.120
how you think how you talk and you have no idea who they are and it's it's it is funny

56:16.120 --> 56:22.960
because I have I have entered I have I developed a response.

56:22.960 --> 56:26.780
So when people like every now and then I'm out shopping it does happen where I'll run

56:26.780 --> 56:32.040
into a listener and so people go Chris and and what do you do when somebody if somebody

56:32.040 --> 56:35.320
walk to me go Wes you know you don't have a right.

56:35.320 --> 56:36.320
What do you say.

56:36.320 --> 56:38.560
My initial response is that's me.

56:38.560 --> 56:42.680
And so when I started dating Hadeah she noticed that this is how it happens and that's that's

56:42.680 --> 56:43.680
me.

56:43.680 --> 56:45.800
So she makes fun of me every time it happens right.

56:45.800 --> 56:49.240
And because people walk up to you and they're like oh I know you and I have no idea what

56:49.240 --> 56:52.360
your name is so and you don't know if it's like someone you should know or if it's someone

56:52.360 --> 56:56.680
you've never met or but at the same time then all of a sudden you get to put a face to like

56:56.680 --> 56:59.640
an IRC name or like an email address.

56:59.640 --> 57:04.240
Yeah so I say yeah there was there was lots of that lots of people introducing themselves

57:04.240 --> 57:07.320
and saying it's good to put a face to the name.

57:07.320 --> 57:15.000
And also lots of people very generously buying all of the podcasters beers Joe rather rather

57:15.000 --> 57:21.640
optimistically had a large bucket in which to collect money to buy beers for the podcasters

57:21.640 --> 57:24.040
and people were extraordinarily generous.

57:24.040 --> 57:30.360
So yes my headache the following morning reflected people's generosity in that regard.

57:30.360 --> 57:33.240
So I just have one last question and Poby's not here.

57:33.240 --> 57:37.160
So I want the full real story.

57:37.160 --> 57:42.640
What was the deal with the laminated show notes?

57:42.640 --> 57:51.560
So the Ubuntu podcast has a reputation for being very well organized.

57:51.560 --> 58:01.000
And in particular Graham from Linux voice finds this a point of much irritation.

58:01.000 --> 58:04.480
So the laminating of the show notes was really.

58:04.480 --> 58:05.480
And the passing of the biscuits.

58:05.480 --> 58:06.480
Really just to wind up Graham.

58:06.480 --> 58:07.480
Yeah.

58:07.480 --> 58:08.480
That was pretty good.

58:08.480 --> 58:09.480
That was.

58:09.480 --> 58:10.480
Yeah.

58:10.480 --> 58:12.720
That was good.

58:12.720 --> 58:15.240
Now laminated show notes is I almost want to.

58:15.240 --> 58:16.240
We'll have to copy that.

58:16.240 --> 58:19.080
I almost want to continue that tradition because it's so brilliant.

58:19.080 --> 58:20.560
I think it's a good reference.

58:20.560 --> 58:21.560
You know it's right on top.

58:21.560 --> 58:22.560
It's great.

58:22.560 --> 58:23.560
Yeah.

58:23.560 --> 58:24.560
Yeah you could.

58:24.560 --> 58:27.720
It worked really well actually because we knew we had 45 minutes and so on our on our

58:27.720 --> 58:38.200
show notes we had the times as you know at 7.30 7.33 you know the bits that we were doing

58:38.200 --> 58:41.000
and we actually stuck to time perfectly.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.760
So it worked out really well in the end.

58:43.760 --> 58:47.960
Well it sounds like a fun event and if we ever get a few of you over here in the US

58:47.960 --> 58:49.800
at one time we've got to.

58:49.800 --> 58:50.800
Yeah it was.

58:50.800 --> 58:56.280
So if anyone isn't hasn't heard so you can go to the current episode of Linux Luddites.

58:56.280 --> 58:59.000
They've got their live recording published now.

58:59.000 --> 59:03.360
The current episode it's episode twenty three and a half of the Ubuntu podcast is just the

59:03.360 --> 59:05.040
live recording from Fostalk.

59:05.040 --> 59:11.840
I don't know if Linux Voice are going to be recording their live recording because there

59:11.840 --> 59:17.320
was a fair amount of beer had been consumed by that point in the evening but I think Joe

59:17.320 --> 59:24.280
is planning to release the Drunken Mashup show as soon as he gets his domain whitelisted

59:24.280 --> 59:25.280
with PodTrack.

59:25.280 --> 59:29.640
So I think definitely three of the shows are going to be.

59:29.640 --> 59:35.400
If you're listening at home I think the order to listen to would be Luddites 84 then the

59:35.400 --> 59:38.880
Ubuntu podcast then Linux Voice if they get it out right.

59:38.880 --> 59:40.520
That's if you want to order the night.

59:40.520 --> 59:48.120
Yeah yeah so it's Linux Luddites, Ubuntu podcast, Linux Voice and then the mashup.

59:48.120 --> 59:49.120
Love it.

59:49.120 --> 59:50.120
Well that sounds like a fun event.

59:50.120 --> 59:51.120
Yeah it really does.

59:51.120 --> 59:52.120
And I think it really was.

59:52.120 --> 59:55.160
Maybe we could see the laminated show notes traditionally continue on.

59:55.160 --> 59:59.000
And thanks to Joe for organizing it because it's a new event in our schedule now and it

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
was a lot of fun.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.400
How come we don't do more like that Wes?

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:02.400
We need that.

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:03.400
We're going to.

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:04.400
Yep.

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:05.400
Absolutely.

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:06.400
We'll figure that out.

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:07.400
We're resolved.

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:08.400
Janice!

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:09.400
Janice would you get on that?

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:10.400
Get right on that.

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:11.680
I just want to talk about SSH hacks.

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:12.680
We got to move in.

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:14.880
That was the community updates and there's a hell of a lot of them it's good stuff too

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.280
so thank you everybody.

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:20.760
Let's get ready for the next segment by mentioning DigitalOcean.

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:26.000
Now this a lot of what we're about to talk about you could easily try out on DigitalOcean.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.720
Simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to getting it your whole system up and running

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:30.720
in no time.

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:32.700
Really simple straightforward and intuitive.

01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:34.200
Great UI to manage it all.

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:39.520
You can get a system spun up in less than 55 seconds and for about five dollars a month

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:43.720
you can run a system with 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU and a terabyte

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:44.720
of transfer.

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:49.260
I say about because I actually would look at DigitalOcean more like in the hourly context.

01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:52.880
If you go over to their pricing switch over to the hourly button there and then you can

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:54.220
really see how this rocks.

01:00:54.220 --> 01:01:01.240
Use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED DOUNPLUGGED all one word lowercase.

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:05.500
You smash it together you put it in there you apply it and they'll give you a $10 credit.

01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:09.120
Now here's what I did this morning just to give you an example of how handy this is.

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:15.360
I wanted to try out a local wiki and I don't really want to learn docu wiki syntax although

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:20.300
I might just end up doing that but I wanted to try out I think it's MD wiki it's markdown

01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:24.160
wiki because I use markdown every single day for our show notes and I thought well wouldn't

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:26.480
it be great if my wiki was marked down.

01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:31.080
Oh here we go and so I looked at MD wiki which apparently has been updated for 20 by since

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:33.320
2014 but I thought I don't care.

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:35.880
If I use this I'm gonna put it on my own local LAN.

01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:41.600
So I could live with that but I'll be honest with you I didn't feel like installing Apache

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:43.760
on my system and setting up PHP.

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:48.760
I just I have better things to do but I want to try don't set up PHP just don't do it don't

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:49.760
do it.

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:50.760
I know right.

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:54.440
I have better things to do and I just don't want to chunk up my system but I wanted to

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:59.920
see if MD wiki was a viable solution because if it is I will set it up on a home server

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:04.640
that's on my LAN for my notes about things like warranty information about appliances

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:09.840
or you know the model of surge protector I got for this or that you know these kinds

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:13.640
of stupid things that you kind of want to keep track of especially when you're in warranty

01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:14.640
stuff.

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:17.360
But you don't want to keep the papers around you don't want to keep anything like that.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:22.800
So I thought okay MD wiki it is so instead of junking up my system in just seconds I

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:30.580
spun up a San Francisco based droplet with Ubuntu 14.04 Apache MySQL and PHP all good

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:31.580
to go.

01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:35.960
So I log in I change my root password first time I log in I change my root password right

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:41.320
there in the message of the day it tells me this is my web directory.

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:43.520
Drop your HTML files in here.

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:45.960
This is the oil to go to.

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:49.160
This is your info dot PHP if you want to see what your PHP install can do.

01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:50.760
I mean I love that.

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:58.800
I up I FCP up the MD dot wiki dot HTML file and I mean within two minutes and 45 seconds

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:02.600
I was able to determine that MD wiki was a total waste of my time.

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:03.600
Like it just sucks.

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:05.240
It doesn't render properly.

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:07.080
It hasn't been updated for years.

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:11.200
It was a and you know what I immediately destroyed the drop.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:12.720
I just like kill it.

01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:13.720
One API call away.

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:15.000
Did I even pay a penny for that.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.080
I don't know.

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:19.600
That's why if you use the promo code deal unplugged this is just a scenario where you

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:22.760
apply a ten dollar credit to your account and leave it in there and when you want to

01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:28.640
try something like this you I deployed the entire stack uploaded the file and determined

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:29.960
that it was a garbage project.

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:33.480
Now within minutes I didn't have to junk up my local host.

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:38.480
I could have installed all of that stuff on my Linux box but I don't really I don't want

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:40.000
Apache installed on my Linux box.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.360
You don't need it and that's why it's great to get that.

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:45.920
So even if you if you want to try out the five dollar machine and run it two months

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:47.460
for free that's awesome.

01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:50.520
But if you just want to apply the credit you can try out like they're super powerful machines

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:51.760
just for minutes.

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:54.200
Try them create something and then destroy them.

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:55.240
And if you want to end up.

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:58.800
And here's the other thing like if I was trying something other than empty wiki because I

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:03.000
would always run that locally but if I was trying something else and it worked fine then

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000
I'm done.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000
It's in production.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.880
It's on a production grade system.

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:07.880
It's ready to go.

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:08.880
Bam.

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:10.520
You have backups you have snapshots whatever you need.

01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:14.160
Yeah and they have an API that makes it super easy to interact with open source apps that

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:15.160
have already been written.

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:16.160
So check it out.

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:17.160
Use the promo code D.O.

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:22.560
Unplugged and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring you know they got a they got

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:24.520
a brand new fancy looking website.

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:25.880
I was about to comment on that.

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:26.880
It's nice right.

01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:27.880
Yeah.

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:28.880
Nice and clean.

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:29.880
All right.

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:31.540
So we're going to talk about SSH hacks and I definitely want to hear from our virtual

01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:35.360
lug on their hacks but you know tricks.

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:41.080
But we should start by mentioning that open SSH version 7.3 was released recently.

01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:44.720
And it has a feature that I want to talk about kind of right off the top before we get into

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:47.340
this thing because this is so cool.

01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:53.360
It added some new features to the proxy jump option proxy jump a command line flag to allow

01:04:53.360 --> 01:05:00.480
simplified indirection through one or more SSH base stations or jump hosts.

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:05.920
So we have an article linked in the show notes how to use a jump host in your SSH client

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:07.080
configurations.

01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:13.240
So my having never actually surprisingly use this and it seems really useful very useful.

01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:18.360
But my understanding is I SSH to one machine which then proxies my SSH connection to an

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:20.100
entirely separate machine.

01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:24.280
And maybe I do this because I could have SSH running on host a on some crazy like port

01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:28.200
four four three kind of config and then it could connect to my actual client.

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:32.760
Well it's also if you're part of like a larger enterprise or like I'm sure I know border

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:33.760
SSH server.

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:34.760
Yeah.

01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:35.760
OK.

01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:36.760
These are the things.

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:38.720
And a lot of in the past a lot of people use net cat or other things to like proxy the

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:39.760
ports between these.

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:42.200
But for a while now SSH has supported this directly.

01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:45.560
They have the capital W command here which takes care of it for you so you don't need

01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:49.980
to evoke any other third party system as you can do it all itself.

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:54.760
So this is just the like tip of the iceberg of stuff that you don't even think about when

01:05:54.760 --> 01:06:01.600
you when I don't want to think about SSH and we have like a whole line of of SSH type tricks.

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:05.120
But there's one I wanted to kind of talk about that you've installed earlier today that's

01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:07.080
sort of the opposite of this stuff.

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:11.920
It's it's really for fun or maybe even for a little bit of research on your own and it's

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:15.320
called cow wire or co wire.

01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:17.600
I guess it's cow or I don't know co wire.

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:20.560
I like cow wire because I like it.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:22.680
I like the idea of like a trip wire.

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:23.680
That's right.

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:24.680
But I think it's a co wire.

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:25.800
Let's go with co wire.

01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:26.800
It's co wire.

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:27.800
I love it.

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:33.360
And it's an SSH honeypot that Wes has set up on one of his servers for us to talk about

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:34.360
here.

01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:36.680
Yeah I love this.

01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:39.680
And I'm kind of curious you've had it going for a couple of hours.

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:40.680
Yeah that's true.

01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:41.680
Let's go look.

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:42.680
Yeah.

01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:46.480
So let me tell folks what co wire does is it's an SSH honeypot designed to log brute

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:50.760
force attacks and shell interactions performed by the attacker.

01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:51.760
Here's some of the interesting features.

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:52.760
You ready for this.

01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:58.080
It creates a fake file system with the ability to add remove files a full fake file system

01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:02.880
resembling resembling I'm sorry a Debian 5.0 install.

01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:03.880
How wonderful is that.

01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:04.880
Nice and secure.

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:05.880
Yeah.

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:09.320
You have the possibility of adding fake file content so the attacker can cat files such

01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:11.160
as Etsy password.

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:14.480
Only minimal file contents are included by the default.

01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:20.120
Open logs are stored in a UML compatible format for easy replay and co wire saves the file

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:29.160
downloads with wget and curl or uploaded with SFTP and SSCP for later inspection.

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:33.960
So you if they if they if they transmit something up to the box it stores it away for you to

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:35.040
look at later.

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:36.040
Which is great.

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:37.040
What are they trying to do.

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:38.040
Mm hmm.

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:39.040
It's a honeypot.

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:41.680
Yeah it's it's a very easy to set up honeypot.

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:42.680
How easy was it to set up.

01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:45.720
I think they might need I'll see about maybe sending them some pull requests.

01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:49.680
There's a couple dependency things that maybe need to be update updated or on like at least

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:53.360
on they had some instructions for Debian at least with 16 or four there's a few things

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:57.840
like their PIP requirements were slightly off but I mean no more than like 10 minutes

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:01.320
of once you've got the Python dependencies installed they have a very nice start and

01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:05.560
stop set of bash scripts for you that you can specify even like a virtual environment

01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:09.280
for you to use that so you don't have to set up anything like that.

01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:10.520
So I thought it was pretty easy to get going.

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:14.760
I do recommend that you have a non root user that you run this as because all of the SSH

01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:16.560
sessions will be in that user's name.

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:17.560
Oh yes.

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:18.560
Is that what you did.

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:19.560
Yes.

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:20.560
So do you.

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:21.560
So OK.

01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:28.760
So could we give the live stream a URL SSH into I mean an address SSH into but they would

01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:34.800
they would have to know the I mean so essentially it's a it's a honeypot they could bang on and

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:37.120
then we could watch what they do.

01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:40.680
It does legitimately have like a username and password they would have to know like

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:43.520
there they'd actually have to be able to hack it right.

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:48.880
Well you can configure that so that actually that's sorry no that's exactly that that's

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:50.720
exactly the point of a honeypot.

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:54.960
You don't just give direct access you need to make it you know challenging so that it

01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:55.960
seems real.

01:08:55.960 --> 01:09:00.400
The first right yeah for yeah for legitimate honeypot but if we want to let the audience

01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:04.640
bang on it and so it actually starts out the way this one's configured as it denies them

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:09.640
the earliest the default config they ship with it denies the two most common root passwords

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:13.520
which is one is just root and the other is like ABC one two three or something like that

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:16.500
or one two three four five six I think is what it is.

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:17.500
It denies those two.

01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:22.360
But right now it's configured so that pretty much any password and any user name you want

01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:24.680
to put the host name in the chat room we'll see if people want to hack away.

01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:28.260
And then it's so I have up on this screen over here is this the is this the correct

01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:29.260
log file.

01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:30.260
It looks like it.

01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:32.200
So you would have maybe refresh it right now though.

01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:35.800
OK what have you used to generate this live log file that I'm looking at here.

01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:40.480
That is SOCAT and tail dash F. There are some better there are some fancier ones that like

01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:44.080
WebSocket D is kind of like a Unix philosophy style WebSocket thing.

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:46.780
It just takes a little bit of JavaScript on the client side to get you to render it.

01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:50.820
So in the future I'd like to have a better prepared live log file.

01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:54.080
But here is a very hacky.

01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:55.480
So we put it in there.

01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:56.480
It's a wasp nest.

01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:57.480
Is that what it is.

01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:58.480
Wasp nest.

01:09:58.480 --> 01:09:59.480
Yep.

01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:00.480
That noble pain dot com.

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:04.160
I'm seeing some incoming connections right now coming into your system West.

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:07.000
I'm going to zoom in on the text so we can we can see it.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:12.320
So if in theory would we see what they do on the file system go to the log here or we

01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:13.320
just seeing their connection.

01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:15.400
You know and it does at least like it logs.

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:18.480
It doesn't necessarily log all the output seemingly but it does log and they have a

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:20.960
separate audit log I can show too.

01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:23.200
It does log all of the commands that people try to run.

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:25.280
So it'll say like like it and it denies some.

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:29.580
So like if config IP it won't let you run but like it'll it'll show you when it finds

01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:31.440
curls w gets that kind of stuff.

01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:34.920
I know I would instead of it so I won't show people's IPs on the screen but I see people

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:38.640
like honey Alex I see trying to log in right now.

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:40.440
This is interesting.

01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:44.320
New keys looks like I don't see if anybody's gotten access yet to you.

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:46.400
I see authorization failed.

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:47.640
This is really should have.

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:52.920
So if you I mean I think even with a blank password you should be able to get in.

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:53.920
That's easy to act.

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:56.120
Actually maybe these people are connecting here because I don't see failed logins for

01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:57.120
these ones.

01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:58.120
Oh here we go.

01:10:58.120 --> 01:10:59.120
Oh boy.

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:00.920
So we got some we got some activity happening now.

01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:02.720
We got some Python scripts running.

01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:05.760
This is this is getting so this is going south real fast.

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:07.800
Oh my gosh Wes.

01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:10.200
Oh I don't know if this is a good idea after all.

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:11.200
But this is pretty fun to watch.

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:14.760
It is pretty fun to watch because we get to we get to watch from like this sort of like

01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:17.220
admin perspective and watch people go crazy.

01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:22.920
This is kind of a fun real easy or I mean relatively easy to set up honeypot co wire

01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:26.840
will have a link in the show notes if you guys want to check it out.

01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:27.840
That's pretty neat.

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:28.840
Are you watching this.

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:29.840
That's pretty fun.

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:32.960
So in the future I'd like to have a live log that like scrolled as you update right now.

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:33.960
Yeah.

01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:34.960
Keep scrolling.

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:35.960
Yeah.

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:36.960
But that's still some people.

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:40.880
It's surprising how many people can't log in and is command not found L.S. you don't

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.200
have L.S. on this thing.

01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:43.200
That is weird.

01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:44.200
I think it should.

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:46.960
I mean when when I it's interesting I can see what commands are attempting to run.

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:47.960
Yes.

01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:48.960
Yeah.

01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:49.960
I like that a lot.

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:50.960
Yeah.

01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:51.960
This is the future of pair hacking.

01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:52.960
Yeah.

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:53.960
There's already a pair program.

01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:55.200
We could have competitions around this legitimately.

01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:59.640
We could set up because we can populate that thing with like rewards and like things for

01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:00.640
people to find.

01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:01.640
Oh yeah.

01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:02.640
And it seems very configurable hackable.

01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:03.640
It's just like a Python.

01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:09.520
Imagine if we if we seeded that with with a pretty big user land full and we had files

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:13.760
in there they had to find and get access to as part of a challenge so you have to get

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:17.400
access to the remote S.H. box and get in there and find certain things on the file system.

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:18.400
That could be a fun game.

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.320
And you could watch it all in real time.

01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:23.000
Now everybody so I'm just going to mention it real quick and we have a great tutorial

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.240
linked in the show notes.

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:26.400
Everybody knows you can use S.S.H. to copy files right.

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:27.400
You guys all know that.

01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:28.960
I think that's pretty basic.

01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:30.560
You probably if you're listening to this show know that.

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:35.100
But if you don't or you haven't messed around with a lot if you've ever heard that Linux

01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:38.320
is hard to copy files around on networks then you don't know about S.C.P.

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:40.600
So we have a link in the show notes that walks you through how to use it.

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:45.440
I use it almost every single day almost almost but you're just moving something down from

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:47.080
a droplet to my machine or something like that.

01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:48.080
Like I just.

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:51.760
Especially if you're doing it right and you already have your key off authenticated that

01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:52.760
kind of stuff set up.

01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:53.760
It makes it very easy.

01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:55.560
And we have we have some instructions on that too.

01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:59.160
There are commands you can do to remotely copy your keys around and we're going to we're

01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:00.640
going to get to that.

01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:03.840
Before we go any further though I before I go through my list does anybody in the Mamba

01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:08.040
room have something they use S.S.H. for all the time like you know copying files with

01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:11.880
our sink or something like that that they want to mention because I think there's some

01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:17.280
uses that people have come up with for S.S.H. like publish something remotely or grab something

01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:20.880
or update something remotely that a lot of us don't think about because we don't have

01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:21.880
those use cases.

01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:24.640
If somebody has an interesting S.S.H. uses I'd love to hear it.

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:31.240
I heard in my in the company I work in if any of the developers is using S.S.H. to connect

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:37.040
to somewhere to do some administrative work usually means somebody's getting fired.

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:38.040
Why?

01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:42.280
Because system administrators should be just have everything magically working for the

01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:46.440
developer not to have to go there and set anything up.

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:50.320
Yeah so they want them and they basically don't want them having shell access.

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:52.200
Yeah they shouldn't be needed.

01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:57.840
Like we're trying to get rid of system administrators and now we're just praising apps for system

01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:58.840
administration.

01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:04.120
Well there I mean there is a certain amount of truth there it just in that like ideally

01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:07.980
and it depends very much on the case and how much technical debt you have etc etc but ideally

01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:11.920
you should have like a log server set up you should have that being absorbed somewhere

01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:16.680
you should have configuration management set up so that ideally the need to S.S.H. is minimal

01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:20.760
but there are lots of cases QA etc where you really do need that S.S.H.

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:21.760
Yeah sure.

01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:25.920
I'd love to hear the use cases over at Solace.

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:33.360
So in Solace we had to come up with a scalable build system as you can imagine and we use

01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:38.000
S.S.H. in a couple of ways to achieve this basically the there is a couple of rules whenever

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.520
writing any software.

01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:44.300
Rule number one never write your own crypto algorithm never do it.

01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:51.080
It's rule number one rule number two behind that really apart from don't use GLib it should

01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:53.900
probably be don't reinvent authentication.

01:14:53.900 --> 01:15:01.160
So have any of you guys used anything like Garrett or get a light or anything like that.

01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:03.080
Yeah I've seen it get a light before.

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:08.000
Okay so one of the very unknown features of S.S.H. is you can actually tell it to run

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000
a command associated with a public key.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Oh yeah.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:17.080
So what we've taken advantage of there is there is an isolated S.S.H.D. which is completely

01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:20.780
separate from the Solace infrastructure itself.

01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:26.280
This one is public key based only and exists only to serve our build system.

01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:30.000
So you have to have a public key and what it does is it S.S.H. is to our script that

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:35.100
runs behind this as a server if you like which then controls all the builds and uses a database

01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:36.480
to store the builds there.

01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:41.680
So we've got public key authentication and we've got Unix PAM authentication going on

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:42.680
in the background there.

01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:44.680
We didn't have to reinvent any of that.

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:50.480
The build servers as well do it though so we can just revoke a key immediately for any

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:54.000
of these servers that are doing it in a pull based system instead of a scheduler and pushing

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.400
them out.

01:15:55.400 --> 01:16:01.600
On top of that our packages are also uploaded with SCP over another S.S.H.D. with only one

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:07.360
there's only one that can upload to this S.S.H.D. which is a true directory where the files

01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:12.760
then land before an I notify team in the background then pulls those files in to index them into

01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:13.760
the unstable repo.

01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:17.200
So it's all S.S.H. powered.

01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:18.200
That's pretty nice.

01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:19.200
I like that.

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:22.720
Nice and secure and easy to understand too.

01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:27.640
Now Wimpy you said you use something that does hardware acceleration for S.S.H.

01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:32.440
What do you what are you talking about or in combination with hardware elaborate sir.

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:38.920
Well so you've got the different crypto algorithms that you can negotiate to establish a S.S.H.

01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:43.560
connection and if you're just you know at the terminal that's kind of irrelevant but

01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:51.880
if you're R-syncing or S.C.P.ing data then you should elect the crypto algorithm that

01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:54.760
is most accelerated on your platform.

01:16:54.760 --> 01:17:01.560
So there are ways to evaluate what the hardware capabilities are both ends and you can then

01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:07.640
configure your S.S.H. config so that when you're connecting to particular hosts it forces to

01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:11.600
use the most accelerated crypto algorithm.

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:22.400
And generally those are the AES 128 GCM and AES 256 GCM algorithms and they can run just

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:25.040
over more than twice the speed of the others.

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:33.040
So you can on the line get nearly up to 400 megabits per second transfer speed as opposed

01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:39.560
to the default which will be maybe 160 170 megabits.

01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:41.680
That is a good one.

01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:48.200
And Darsani you have kind of an interesting use case where you wanted to remotely watch

01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:50.120
a server's traffic to do some troubleshooting.

01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:51.920
Tell me about this.

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:56.760
Well I was testing a, first of all can you hear me?

01:17:56.760 --> 01:17:57.760
Yeah yeah we hear you.

01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:58.760
Okay okay.

01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:05.360
I was testing this man-in-the-middle sort of software it would watch outbound packages

01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:12.560
to make sure that you know no one was suspiciously sending bad, sorry secret stuff to the network

01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:13.760
right.

01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:21.520
And so we had to use a regex and it would watch the outbound traffic using regex.

01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:27.120
So I ran a, well I had to do both of the things on my server right.

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:33.440
I had to watch the wowza traffic which is a RTMP server and I had to run that on my

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:38.480
local machine and then I had to run the client to the local machine.

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:41.320
So I had to use a SH tunnel to myself.

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:45.880
I could have used netcat but I didn't have that available at the time.

01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:54.720
So I was able to watch the traffic inbound on the wowza server and then like TCP dump

01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:59.440
it or was it Wireshark it so I can read it.

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:04.040
Yes that is super super useful and a nice little, well not a hack but it's a hack in

01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:08.640
like the workflow sense a hack where you can sort of put yourself over there.

01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:14.760
You know you heard us mentioning keys there is a command called ssh-copy-id and then user

01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:20.240
at host and this is a nice way to enable passwordless logins, copy your keys around.

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:21.240
We have a couple of articles.

01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:24.640
I have a couple that I highlighted like you can output, here's a good one.

01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:28.840
You can output your microphone to a remote computer speaker.

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:35.680
If I don't have not tried this but supposedly using DD and then piping it over to SSH and

01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:41.600
then at the remote host using DD to go to their sound device the output of the sound

01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:45.800
from your microphone port to the SSH target's computer speaker port, sound quality is very

01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:48.120
bad so you hear a lot of hissing.

01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:52.520
I haven't tried it but that sounds freaking ridiculous.

01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:57.480
Also you can attach to a screen over SSH which that's probably a hack worth mentioning right

01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:05.200
there is use screen with SSH, use screen with SSH and also how to establish a remote GNU

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:09.280
screen session that you can reconnect to right by starting the SSH command.

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:14.520
You SSH in to the machine and then you execute the user bin screen command dash lowercase

01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:17.760
X capital RR and then start with the screen session.

01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:19.060
That's a good tip right there.

01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:20.060
Screen with that.

01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:23.920
Just reading the SSH man page is a great tip I think honestly.

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:28.280
There are so many arguments there that just are gold mines.

01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:32.680
Did you find this hacker news thread where a bunch of people posted their favorite quote

01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:39.200
unquote things you can make SSH do and there's some very good ones over here that we'll link

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:41.520
in the show notes too also.

01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:49.600
So I think I have probably shared this story before but I'll risk sharing it again.

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:52.480
I don't know if I actually have shared it on the show but before I do it, is anybody

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:55.400
else in the – oh there we go, Mr. Fax.

01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:56.400
You had – Auto SSH, right.

01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:57.400
Yeah, I saw that earlier.

01:20:57.400 --> 01:20:58.400
Tell me about Auto SSH.

01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:02.680
Well, Auto SSH is very cool.

01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:07.720
For example, if you have a remote computer that cannot open a firewall port but you have

01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:15.360
a server at home that can open the port, then you can set up Auto SSH that the server automatically

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:21.200
– that the client connects to the server automatically and then you do a reverse, tunnel

01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:23.840
to the client and get a shell of the client.

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:29.280
And so you can use Auto SSH for backing up the client via Orsync or something else.

01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:31.440
It's really, really cool.

01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:33.240
That is – I like that.

01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:35.040
And so it's Auto SSH.

01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:40.520
So Wimpy, you were talking about fwknop which is like a – I'm guessing a port-knocking

01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:41.520
tool.

01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:42.520
What's this?

01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:43.520
It's not port-knocking.

01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:50.600
It's a single packet authentication mechanism so it's like an additional layer on top

01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:51.600
of SSH.

01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:56.560
So like instead of port-knocking, something maybe – like an alternative, cool, cool.

01:21:56.560 --> 01:22:05.840
So it's sort of a key-based packet authentication mechanism that then enables you the rest of

01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:09.320
your SSH connection to then establish.

01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:14.400
So you can have SPA and then you have your key-based authentication.

01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:15.640
So this is the way we have things.

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:22.840
We have SPA, key-based authentication and then you get a one-time password as well.

01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:28.240
And it actually prints the QR code on the terminal that you can scan with your phone

01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:31.920
to get your then second factor as well.

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:35.880
So it's like three-factor authentication to an SSH jump server.

01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:37.040
That's awesome.

01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:43.560
I guess I almost feel like I have to mention, yes, you can do X11 forwarding with SSH too.

01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:46.240
I think people would be like, how come you didn't mention this?

01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:49.160
And probably remote command execution.

01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:53.040
You can just send a remote command over there, which is amazing.

01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:54.040
The other one is –

01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:55.040
Socks proxying.

01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:56.040
Yes.

01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:57.040
Socks proxying is huge.

01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:58.040
Of course.

01:22:58.040 --> 01:22:59.040
I have to mention that, yeah.

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:00.600
I will say too, like you were talking about SCP, which works great, but when you're doing

01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:04.520
a recursive copy, a lot of times piping tar over SSH will be better.

01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:05.520
Yeah.

01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:06.520
Or rsync.

01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:08.000
I used rsync in combination.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:14.040
So rsync is managing the file copy, but it's doing it through SSH, which if you think about

01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:17.000
it, is such a brilliant combination of two of the best things.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.760
It's legitimately like Nutella and peanut butter, which really does go well together,

01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:24.800
and peanut butter and jelly, which my kids don't think go well together, but one day

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:27.480
I will convince them does go well together.

01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:33.840
It is so great, because you get the power and really the reliability and peace of mind

01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:39.700
of rsync with the encryption and protection of SCP or SSH.

01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:40.780
So that's a great combo too.

01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:44.520
So I feel like I'd be probably remiss, because a lot of comments would be, how come you didn't

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:45.520
say this?

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:47.120
Those are sort of the obvious ones too.

01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:50.760
Yeah, the proxying stuff is really nice.

01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:55.160
I've seen a lot of articles online called the poor man's VPN using SSH.

01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:56.840
There's a lot of articles that cover how to do that.

01:23:56.840 --> 01:24:00.700
Oh yeah, especially the SOCKS proxy, aka the capital D flag.

01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:02.640
It's better than rsync thing.

01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:03.640
Hmm.

01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:04.640
Yeah, maybe.

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:06.840
Yeah, that might be true.

01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:11.240
All right, Mumble Room, anybody else have an SSH tip or trick or hack that they love

01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:13.240
about SSH before we move on?

01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:14.960
Going once.

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:15.960
You do?

01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:16.960
I do.

01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:20.520
I just want to mention the lowercase w flag for setting up ton slash tap devices.

01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:23.440
SSH can be your layer two, layer three VPN.

01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:24.440
It's all over TCP.

01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:27.760
So if you're super performance critical, it's not the thing to do.

01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:33.080
If you're on a good connection, I've gotten speed ups over bad links using DigitalOcean.

01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:37.080
Or if you just want something like you have some apps that don't respect SOCKS proxies,

01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:41.640
but you want to proxy them through SSH, on Linux you just bam, now you have a new interface,

01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:42.640
bind them to that interface.

01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:43.640
There you go.

01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:46.920
And it's nice because everything you need is already installed, as long as you have

01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:47.920
SSH installed.

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:48.920
Exactly.

01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:49.920
And so it's, and you know it's there.

01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:52.720
You just need to enable the right things in your SSH deconfig on the other end, but that's

01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:53.720
the case for a lot of these.

01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:56.560
Will you toss that in the show notes too, how to do that?

01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:57.920
We'll have a link in there, how to do that.

01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:02.500
You know, this is actually, so how to do it, I should really stop right here and I should

01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:07.220
mention Linux Academy because if we're talking about this stuff and it's a little over your

01:25:07.220 --> 01:25:12.360
head or you want to know more, Linux Academies would just be a fantastic resource.

01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:15.440
Go to linuxacademy.com slash unplug to support this show.

01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:19.480
Now they also have all the advanced topics around Linux, but it really is a great platform

01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:21.200
for learning more about this kind of stuff.

01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:25.440
They've got the essentials and really all of the things that have sort of been built

01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:26.440
on top of it.

01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:31.640
Stuff you really, if you haven't been through proper training, the little details you might

01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:34.860
have missed that make a difference, plus on top of all of it they have instructor mentoring

01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:36.040
to help you as you go.

01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:40.440
Learning paths, series of courses and content planned by instructors for very specific types

01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:45.900
of career tracks, and then if you're busy, they have learning plans, so you can pick

01:25:45.900 --> 01:25:49.680
a course and set a time frame and fit to it that matches your schedule.

01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:52.800
They have note cards that can be forked by the community to help with studying.

01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:57.520
They have video courses with self-paced in-depth video guides on every single freaking topic

01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:02.380
around Linux, the cloud itself, DevOps.

01:26:02.380 --> 01:26:06.500
The labs and exercises are unique because they give you the real world confidence to

01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:08.080
do this stuff.

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:12.200
You're walking away from something where you've really worked hands-on with it, so you have

01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:18.880
the confidence to work with the real technology in production.

01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:23.980
For me personally, that would be worth the entire Linux Academy subscription right there.

01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:29.600
The Nuggets give you a deep dive into something when you just want to go into a single topic,

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:32.440
and they have iOS and Android apps to help you study from your mobile device.

01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:36.080
They have a community stacked full of Jupyter Broadcasting members because they've been

01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:39.560
advertising here for a while now, and they're constantly expanding.

01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:41.580
They're always adding new content.

01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:43.600
They're always improving the previous content.

01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:53.080
If anything we've mentioned today sounds new to you, you probably could have learned more

01:26:53.080 --> 01:27:00.120
at Linux Academy, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:07.720
Over the years, I have bought into many management systems, systems to manage my photos, systems

01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:13.840
to manage my mp3s, applications and systems to manage my notes, my personal notes, my

01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:17.240
client notes, my family notes, my work.

01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:23.240
Oh, Wes, you know what I've learned after all of these years?

01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:25.840
Just put it on the damn file system.

01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:28.460
Turns out we solved this in the early 90s.

01:27:28.460 --> 01:27:29.880
Just make a damn file out of it.

01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:33.720
If you have it on the damn file system, then I can get to it when I SSHN.

01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:35.720
I can get to it when I bring up my file manager.

01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:37.680
I can get to it from my Guake drop-down terminal.

01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:44.680
I can get to it from an application that sits on top of it.

01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:52.280
Not many times, I would imagine, in my adult life will I sort of completely start over.

01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:56.960
The house I moved out of, it was unique because we had a lot of input on how it was built.

01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:01.800
I had a lot of knowledge of how it was wired and where everything was done at and what

01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:06.800
was what, but I didn't properly capture that information.

01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:08.960
As time went on, the details became fuzzy.

01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:13.840
I thought I'd memorize it, and today I couldn't even tell you how many Ethernet ports I had

01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:17.200
installed, which to me just seems ridiculous.

01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:21.280
Now that I've moved into LadyJubes and I've begun building a home network, which you and

01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:27.760
I were talking about on the pre-show, I thought to myself, I am really at such a square one

01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:30.880
position again, which is so rare, which I know you're kind of going through the same

01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:32.880
thing having just moved.

01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:38.160
It's rare when you're like, I can tear down everything I have right now and start fresh.

01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:42.800
One of the things I have learned about myself is I will forget the little details over time

01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:45.640
because life goes on.

01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:47.640
I thought, wouldn't it be wonderful?

01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:54.320
Wouldn't it be an accomplishment if I could document properly everything, serial numbers,

01:28:54.320 --> 01:29:00.040
warranty information, support information, implementation, configuration details, and

01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:04.280
have a spot to put it all that I could recall it fairly easily.

01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:09.480
That started me down the path of trying to find the perfect wiki software.

01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:13.640
I think I kind of blame Noah for this because he started talking about it on Linux Action

01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:14.640
Show this Sunday.

01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:18.800
It's a diary where he puts his thoughts and feelings into about clients and stuff.

01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:21.940
And I thought, geez, I could really use a spot that was kind of safe.

01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:25.000
Some sort of like personal store, you can come back to it.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.000
It's there when you want it.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.240
You can ignore it when you want to.

01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:32.320
And maybe, and legitimately, Wes, years could go by before I have to reference information.

01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:33.400
Without touching it.

01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:35.720
It's like maybe my refrigerator's warranty information.

01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:40.080
Or that old notebook you have and you come back and you're like, okay, yeah, that's right.

01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:46.460
And so I started with DocuWiki, which is a very simple to use local wiki.

01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:47.760
It's really nice.

01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:52.780
I highly recommend it if you are very familiar with its Wiki Sinti.

01:29:52.780 --> 01:29:55.440
But it didn't fit my needs.

01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:57.480
So I was a little disappointed.

01:29:57.480 --> 01:30:01.880
I looked at MD Wiki, didn't fit my needs, hasn't been updated.

01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:04.440
So I've been a little disappointed.

01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:09.440
So Wimpy, I want to hear about ZimWiki because it is definitely a name I've seen go by online,

01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:11.320
even if mentioned by the community a few times.

01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:12.680
Have you messed around with it?

01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:17.880
Yeah, it's what I use for keeping all of my sort of documentation notes.

01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:24.640
So it's a desktop wiki, a GTK desktop application for doing wiki and note taking.

01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:28.920
And it does, you know, document linking, just like how wiki works.

01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:31.800
But all of the documents are just text documents.

01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:35.800
So I've got those synchronized to all of my machines.

01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:39.680
Now the syntax, is it like its own unique little special syntax?

01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:40.680
Or is it?

01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:44.960
Well, I'll tell you what, I'll bring one up in a text editor rather than Zim and I'll

01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:45.960
tell you.

01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:46.960
Oh, OK.

01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:47.960
Yeah.

01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:50.640
And and it just it just it just looks at local files on your file system.

01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:54.200
And yeah, so I just got a folder called notebooks.

01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:56.120
I think I have looked at ZimWiki in the past.

01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:58.520
You know, it does seem very familiar.

01:30:58.520 --> 01:30:59.520
Yeah.

01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:02.320
But so why use this instead of just create files on your file system?

01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:08.720
Why not just have a directory structure that makes sense and just put on the file system?

01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:18.600
They its content type is text X in wiki and the markup looks like markdown ish.

01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:19.600
Hmm.

01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:20.600
Hmm.

01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:22.320
I like markdown ish.

01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:26.640
I mean, it depends on how close, but and and you find this to be more efficient than just

01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:29.320
having a good file structure?

01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:36.520
Yes, because you can cross link the documents and you can create like a higher level category

01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:39.480
and then hierarchies within that.

01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:41.960
And it does the wiki linking within it as well.

01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:49.400
So if you want to link back to stuff, I think I mean, I don't use it for formatting.

01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:52.600
I use it for hurling information in.

01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:59.200
So when I'm chatting to people on IRC, I just grab whole conversations out of IRC, dump

01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:00.960
them into Zim wiki.

01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:05.880
So I've got a record of that and then I can go through and, you know, tidy up a later

01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:09.500
date and turn it into something, you know, more useful.

01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:12.320
In fact, I've got all of my documentation in there.

01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:13.920
And how are you syncing that at all?

01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:15.680
Are you just one machine has it all?

01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:18.360
No, I'm I sync it.

01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:20.120
Using?

01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:21.720
I use Sparkle Share for that.

01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:24.160
Oh, man, I want to use I want to pick it up.

01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:25.440
I'm thinking about using Sparkle Share.

01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:27.000
You know, that's the one I haven't tried.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.720
Yeah, I like.

01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:31.280
For this Sparkle Share works really well.

01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:32.280
Yeah.

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:36.120
Because it's just text you come in, you can put screenshots and stuff in there.

01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:40.160
And Sparkle Share is designed to do that sort of collaboration thing.

01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:44.920
So it's got get behind the scenes, you just blast all up to GitHub, you just like slam

01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:46.280
it all up there.

01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:47.440
You don't have to do it.

01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:49.280
Sparkle Share just does it for you.

01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:53.620
It's the read and write operations and does all of the commits for you.

01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:55.240
And it has a format for the commit.

01:32:55.240 --> 01:33:00.560
So you can see what was an addition or an edit or a deletion or, you know, and so on.

01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:03.240
So it just takes care of it all for you.

01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:06.880
As I recall, the last time I do remember now looking at this, you can do things like you

01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:11.120
can set bolted lists, or I mean, lists that you can checkbox like checkbox lists, you

01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:12.960
can have calendar embeds with reminders.

01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:15.800
Oh, yeah, that is quite a lot of functionality.

01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:17.240
Yeah, this is a good one.

01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:19.440
This is Zim Wiki, I think has got to be top of my list.

01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:21.700
Here's the other one I'm playing with right now.

01:33:21.700 --> 01:33:24.200
And I don't know if you've had a chance to try it out.

01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:28.840
It's called, it's been recommended before, I think I might have mentioned it even before,

01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:31.320
and I've been intending to really give it a go.

01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:33.160
It's called Tagspaces.

01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:36.080
And you can find it at tagspaces.org.

01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:40.620
And it's an open source personal data manager, quote unquote, that helps you organize and

01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:43.200
browse your files on every platform.

01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:45.320
Now, here's a couple of the details.

01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:47.880
And I'll tell you why I ended up using it too.

01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:49.560
It's running completely offline.

01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:53.560
There's no cloud integration at all, no login required.

01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:57.840
And you can still use it on platforms like own cloud or Dropbox or BitTorrent Sync Sync

01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:01.660
thing, Sparkle file, Spider Oak, whatever.

01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:06.080
It's got a pay version, and it's also all open source.

01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:11.360
So I like that it does have a sustainable revenue model that seems pretty reasonable.

01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:12.360
Totally.

01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:13.360
I'm going to be around for a while.

01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:15.340
If I'm going to rely on it, yeah.

01:34:15.340 --> 01:34:17.040
It is an Electron app.

01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:18.980
I'll get that out here, but then I'll tell you a bit more about it.

01:34:18.980 --> 01:34:24.120
You can organize your photos, eBooks, music, recipes, invoices, and you can do it on Windows,

01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:28.640
Linux, OS X, Android, Firefox, and Chrome because they have plug-ins.

01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:31.440
It features basic file management operations.

01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:34.640
You can create edit notes in plain text, markdown, or HTML.

01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:38.080
You can use Tagspaces to organize eBooks too, which I think is especially nice.

01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:43.500
But on top of that, which is also especially nice, is managing PDFs.

01:34:43.500 --> 01:34:47.860
This is something where I have gotten an influx recently of manuals and PDFs for pieces of

01:34:47.860 --> 01:34:52.440
equipment that I now have in Lady Jupiter, and what the hell do I do with these PDFs?

01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:55.520
How do I keep track of which one's for the water pump, which one's for the furnace, which

01:34:55.520 --> 01:35:01.140
one's for the inverter, which one's for the converter, which one's for the black tank?

01:35:01.140 --> 01:35:05.660
This is ridiculous, and so this kind of helps me put my head around all of this, and also

01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:09.960
it does the same thing for photos, which is nice because I have photos of particular pieces

01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:11.960
of equipment and electronics.

01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:16.840
The application supports adding tags to files in a transparent, not vendor-locking way.

01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:19.040
You can tag your files by simply drag and drop actions.

01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:21.360
You can organize your tags thematically in groups.

01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:24.480
It has smart tags too for date-based stuff.

01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:27.460
Of course, it has file and search and all that.

01:35:27.460 --> 01:35:29.480
It has a quote-unquote responsive design.

01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:30.480
You can resize it.

01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:38.400
You can browse by tag, and it has a pro version if you want to spend the money, and I've only

01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:39.400
begun working with it.

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:41.440
And it sits right on top of whatever file system you have.

01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:45.660
Exactly, and that's what I like is, so at the end of the day, I could SSH into a home

01:35:45.660 --> 01:35:49.460
server and just browse the file system and get this information, but if I'm sitting at

01:35:49.460 --> 01:35:54.640
a machine, there's a bunch of different filters I can get at and use based on tags or metadata

01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:59.720
information or file creation date or category or by linking.

01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:04.820
I could go look at the RV branch or the audio equipment branch and have all of the information

01:36:04.820 --> 01:36:11.860
I need in there, and I like that I can also then include things like pictures and markdown

01:36:11.860 --> 01:36:16.120
information so I can put links in there and all of it's offline.

01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:17.680
See, that part is awesome.

01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:22.320
So all I have to do is load up a computer with this to sit on top of the file system.

01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:23.320
It scans the file system.

01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:24.320
It gets this information.

01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:26.000
Where does it store its configuration?

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:29.280
Now I haven't dug too far, but there is a database file.

01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:34.680
So the way I currently use it is I downloaded the entire thing, and there's packages available,

01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:37.660
but it's also an Electron app, so I just downloaded a single directory.

01:36:37.660 --> 01:36:38.660
Everything is self-contained.

01:36:38.660 --> 01:36:41.640
All the data files, config are all in this one directory.

01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:46.040
I tar.gz this one folder, and I've got everything I need.

01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:47.040
I extract that.

01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:50.680
I've got everything I need to just have it once again point at the file system, and it's

01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:51.920
good to go again.

01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:53.040
So that's been working.

01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:55.800
That's sort of a real portable setup because I've been able to replicate that a couple

01:36:55.800 --> 01:37:00.160
of times now and have it look at the same network path, and that's been pretty solid.

01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:04.080
So this isn't totally in production yet because my final plan would be I'm going to set up

01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:09.540
a final file server in LadyJubes, put all of the data on that, and then from a laptop

01:37:09.540 --> 01:37:10.920
front end point this at it.

01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:14.200
So I've just been experimenting temporarily, and I'm liking this.

01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:16.160
I'm not totally done yet.

01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:21.920
So there is still room for something like ZimWiki or another solution, but the one thing

01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:25.700
I do like about this is over the years I keep going back to just putting it on the file

01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:30.400
system for my photos, my audio books, my MP3s, my docs.

01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:31.400
Just put it on the file system.

01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:35.560
And especially it excels at that if you can bin it and just stick it in a thing, like

01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:40.200
a drill down hierarchy, and so if this can add that missing layer of kind of like how

01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:41.200
do I find related things?

01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:42.200
How do I find these?

01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:45.440
I don't want to put them in the same folder, but I do want to know that they're related.

01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:48.480
So if that could easily add that on top, that's very interesting.

01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:50.480
And it's also available for Android.

01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:52.240
Now I don't know exactly how this would work.

01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:55.680
I don't know how I would point Android at the same data source.

01:37:55.680 --> 01:38:00.720
However, they do have some WebDAV support, and I've included that in the show notes where

01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:04.160
you can host it and then use WebDAV to connect to it.

01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:08.320
Maybe that's how I could have my laptop and my Android client accessing the same information.

01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:12.640
I'm not sure I'd want to expose it this way, but it's nice that it can look at a WebDAV

01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:15.680
share and have the same functionality.

01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:18.440
But if I was really going to go that route, I'd probably use something like Spider Oak

01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:22.960
or C file or some sort of background syncing service, yeah.

01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:23.960
So that's tag spaces.

01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:25.760
I really have to think I'm going to give that a try.

01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:29.240
I've looked at some like there's some fuse based tags, file systems, that sort of thing,

01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:32.360
and none of them have really stuck.

01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:34.920
Have you thought about as you're setting up your network in your new place, if you're

01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:39.200
going to take down notes on how things are set up, like what the passwords are and...

01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:42.520
Yeah, you know, and I do have my own key pass database and that kind of thing.

01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:43.840
You just kind of keep notes in there right now?

01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:48.480
I do that for like account based things, but there's a lot of stuff, kind of stuff you're

01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:52.680
hitting on, a lot of that maintenance stuff, a lot of the just the little details in life

01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:55.920
that I don't, you know, maybe they're in Google Drive.

01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:57.580
Maybe they're on my own file server.

01:38:57.580 --> 01:39:01.140
Maybe they're backed up in tar snap, but I don't have a lot of those linkages between

01:39:01.140 --> 01:39:03.760
them and I rely on the find command or something like that.

01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:07.680
So this seems like a really good way to be like, okay, these are all associated with

01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:08.680
the network.

01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:12.840
These are all associated with, you know, the appliances that I own.

01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:15.040
So I'm very curious to see how that works out.

01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:18.040
And I do think that the, you know, there's a lot of objections to being an electron app,

01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:21.720
but this seems like also kind of a middle ground where it's actually kind of reasonable

01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:25.720
because the features they want, I like that it's very pretty.

01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:26.720
It seems usable.

01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:29.800
It seems like something I could have someone who wasn't even a Linux user or a tech savvy

01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:32.600
person jump right in and use it without worrying about it.

01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:37.200
Seriously, when you first launch it, it steps you through sort of the logic of the application

01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:41.320
and it gives you a good layout of how this is, how you interact with it.

01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:42.640
This is where things are stored at.

01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:43.640
Yeah, that's really nice.

01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:48.200
Wimpy, you had a point of clarification about open filer or filler or I don't know unless

01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:51.040
go ahead, sir, fire away.

01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:56.160
At the end of this week's lash, you said that you were experimenting with open filer.

01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:57.200
Yes, sir.

01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:59.040
Did you mean open filer?

01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:00.040
I don't know.

01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:01.040
I guess.

01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:02.040
Why would I not?

01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:03.520
I don't think Chris knows what he's talking about.

01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:05.160
Have you listened to the show before?

01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:08.040
I have not installed it.

01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:15.060
I intend to install on an Intel NUC attached to probably about three terabytes worth of

01:40:15.060 --> 01:40:21.160
test storage open filer, but unless I'm calling for it.

01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:22.560
You're getting name conflated.

01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:23.560
With what?

01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:26.640
So we were discussing Open Media Vault.

01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:27.640
There are two of them.

01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:28.640
Yes, that's right.

01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:29.920
Yeah, maybe I was because I haven't downloaded it yet.

01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:30.920
So maybe I was.

01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:33.800
That's actually my to-do this week.

01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:36.680
Open filer is like a sort of a dead project.

01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:38.520
So you and I were discussing Open Media Vault.

01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:39.520
I can't keep it straight anymore.

01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:40.520
Yeah.

01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:41.520
I guess I probably was.

01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:42.520
It was probably that's what I give for it.

01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:44.000
Was it an off-the-cuff comment that I make?

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.600
Was an off-the-cuff thing I said on the show?

01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:47.400
Yeah, it was towards the end of the show.

01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:48.400
Yeah.

01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:49.400
Yeah.

01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:52.740
Sometimes when I speak off-the-cuff, I don't really, I get, I do that, I got in trouble

01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:58.540
last week for saying something off-the-cuff too, which was just a totally like, I just,

01:40:58.540 --> 01:40:59.540
you know what I'm talking about.

01:40:59.540 --> 01:41:00.540
I do.

01:41:00.540 --> 01:41:02.840
I don't know what my problem is.

01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:03.840
I don't know what it is.

01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:07.680
And unless it's a prepared statement, take Chris's words with a grain of salt.

01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:09.920
He probably means like two versions different.

01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:10.920
I would like that not to be the case though.

01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:13.280
Or around the name by a few letters.

01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:16.740
The only reason I'm seeking clarification is because Chris and I've been discussing

01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:17.740
Open Media Vault.

01:41:17.740 --> 01:41:21.960
And if he downloads Open Filer thinking this is what I recommended, he's going to be very

01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:22.960
disappointed.

01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:24.600
Well, I did download Open Filer though.

01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:30.080
So I guess I just won't even, I haven't installed it yet, but I have downloaded it.

01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:31.680
And I don't know if I've downloaded Open Media Vault.

01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:34.960
I feel like I should, so the project's not being, because I feel like I was going to,

01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:35.960
I should at least look at it.

01:41:35.960 --> 01:41:40.320
But if the project's not really being worked on, that sort of seals that deal for me.

01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:45.720
I thought it had sort of stagnated and when, SP in the chat room says 2011.

01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:50.300
Yeah when you look at their documentation, they talk about Linux 2.6.

01:41:50.300 --> 01:41:53.520
So you are, this is probably, this is a good time to mention this.

01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:56.080
So I don't want to overdo this.

01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:59.920
I know I've talked about this a lot recently, but I'm currently in the process of redoing

01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:02.560
my network storage and I want to try out a bunch of things.

01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:05.720
And I had Rockstore on the list too, although I just recently eliminated that, I was talking

01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:07.240
to Wes about that earlier today.

01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:10.120
It sounds like Open Filer's off the list now.

01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:17.700
Right now what's on my list is Open Media Vault and Free NAS and I have feelers into

01:42:17.700 --> 01:42:23.200
QNAP because they have a rig that runs Ubuntu that I think would also be very cool.

01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:28.760
Now I'm just crossing, I'm just going to cross Rockstore and Open Filer off the list, which

01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:33.640
really brings it down to, if I'm going to roll it myself, Free NAS or Open Media Vault.

01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:39.280
Like I'm down to two now and what's pushing me towards Open Media Vault in honesty is

01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:42.560
Wimpy has got a great testimony for it.

01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:45.280
He's really sort of sold me on it.

01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:48.240
Do you want to talk about your implementation at all or at least why you've been happy with

01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:49.240
it?

01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:53.200
Yeah, I mean I've been using it for years and years now.

01:42:53.200 --> 01:43:00.480
I think I started using it around the 0.4 period and it's 2. something is the stable

01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:07.120
release and 3.0 is imminent I think looking at how that's been developing.

01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:12.360
But it's a Debian based NAS solution.

01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:19.040
The two series is based on Weezy and the three series is based on Jessie.

01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:26.240
There's a site called omvextras.org which is the community maintained plugins and it

01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:34.640
has plugins for quite literally everything imaginable including ZFS and SnapRaid and

01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:42.120
Grey Hole and just about every disk management and redundancy strategy you can imagine.

01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:46.720
So it's a fun thing to play with because you can really explore the options that best suit

01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:54.840
you if you just want to add disks of unequal sizes there are redundancy strategies to support

01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:55.840
that.

01:43:55.840 --> 01:44:00.120
Or you can go with ZFS or you can go with LVMs and XFS you know there's a whole raft

01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:01.320
of options.

01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:08.160
But it's got plugins for MB server and Plex server and all of the stuff that some people

01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:11.640
use sick beard and couch potato and stuff like that.

01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:12.640
Nice.

01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:13.640
The essential.

01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:18.720
Yeah it just is just everything it just you know all in one thing and because it's Debian

01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:24.960
under the hood when you need to you can just SSH into it and set up the bits that you need

01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:27.400
that are specific to what you want to do.

01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:32.640
This is exactly what I was talking about earlier this is yeah so if I so just to just to jump

01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:41.080
in here is it if I'm correct is it based on Debian 8 is it or so 2.2 whatever the current

01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:45.320
two series is which is the stable version currently that's based on wheezy which is

01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:50.760
Debian 7 yeah the three series which is in beta at the moment and I get the impression

01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:57.420
is very close to final that's based on Jesse which is Debian 8 nice okay I'm currently

01:44:57.420 --> 01:45:09.860
running two instances of open media vault 2 and like you I'm preparing a nut to replace

01:45:09.860 --> 01:45:14.520
both of those and that's going I'm going to I'm building that the moment that's running

01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:19.080
version 3 and and how has that gone so far because that's I was thinking about starting

01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:24.120
with 3.0 when it came to open media vault just to just so I got a sense of where they're

01:45:24.120 --> 01:45:30.240
going because I'm not likely to want to reload my system a month from now or up and when

01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:37.760
I when I went to version 2 a couple of years ago I did install the betas and upgraded them

01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:42.060
to final so I you know I did the initial deployment on the beta so I've done that before and it's

01:45:42.060 --> 01:45:48.000
been fine yeah it's fine it's got 30 terabytes hanging off the back of it so that's cooking

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:53.720
along just fine and how the plugins work for you yeah so that was the thing I've been sort

01:45:53.720 --> 01:46:00.040
of keeping track on how the plugins are developing and the ones that I need are now all available

01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:06.380
and as best as I can see all work perfectly fine so the first beta for version 3 came

01:46:06.380 --> 01:46:12.040
out in sort of January of this year there was another beta release about a month ago

01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:17.640
so you know this sort of six months development time and in that period I think a lot of the

01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:22.320
work has really been around the having the community maintainers for the plugins update

01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:30.040
their plugins to support the new API in version 3 so that on launch day all or most of the

01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:36.140
plugins are available yes absolutely that's that's a good healthy community you know and

01:46:36.140 --> 01:46:40.880
I was just talking to Angela too she has an old arch system that hasn't been updated for

01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:48.200
like a year and wow I was thinking maybe we just the Chris ops special over there yeah

01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:55.340
and I thought well whatever whatever in media open media vault or free nas or whatever solution

01:46:55.340 --> 01:46:59.960
I end up on I should probably replicate because she has a knock at her house okay and so I

01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:04.500
think I'm gonna it whatever when I end up on I'm probably gonna do a pretty wide deployment

01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:09.400
of it and at least two maybe three installations well it would be really nice to have nailed

01:47:09.400 --> 01:47:13.160
down that like storage appliance roll at your own something you understand that you don't

01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:17.560
have to necessarily buy you can roll it your own and I like buying local aka having it

01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:22.360
run Linux yeah I think that's nice not the free nas isn't a great product no totally

01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:28.700
but you already open media vault is kind of a not spin-off exactly but a reaction to free

01:47:28.700 --> 01:47:35.240
nas so the lead developer of open media vault was a free nas developer and he had a disagreement

01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:42.920
with direction that free nas was going so created a media vault as a result interesting

01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:48.640
and also sort of encouraging as well so I will put a link to open media vault org if

01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:53.800
you guys have any implementation tips or experience let me know because I'll be kicking the tires

01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:58.880
probably in the next couple of weeks I'll have I'm gonna I'm gonna try to get it installed

01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:03.980
by Thursday afternoon so I have at least a couple of weeks of production experience with

01:48:03.980 --> 01:48:07.840
it and you mean so you can tell Alan that you really don't need BSD to run your storage

01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:13.820
appliance and then I'll probably review a little bit after that and then whatever I

01:48:13.820 --> 01:48:20.960
end up on I'm going to deploy a stamp of approval yeah I'll go put I'm gonna go install under

01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:27.920
some bench seats in in lady jibs cool so are you using a ZFS wimpy or you're using a different

01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:36.460
file system I've got one of the boxes so the primary box is running XFS on an LVM and the

01:48:36.460 --> 01:48:44.280
backup unit is running on ZFS cool that's and when I say backup this is an active passive

01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:51.360
cluster so if for any reason I need to update or reboot the first one then the the other

01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:57.720
one takes over that's the way to do it well betide I interrupt my daughter's viewing of

01:48:57.720 --> 01:49:03.160
her favorite right so I'm looking back at their release log too and you know I see I

01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:08.120
see updates in May I see updates I think two updates in May actually and I see an update

01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:13.480
on June 15th so and then of course three I was just around the corner so the projects

01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:17.680
boy what I mean compared to open file looking open filers releases this so there's definitely

01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:23.440
a pulse here yeah and there's also images for the Raspberry Pi and the Odroid C2 and

01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:29.320
the Odroid XU3 and 4 so there's you know and cue boxes and stuff so it's quite an interesting

01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:36.800
project in that the the main OS is it's just bulletproof I mean it just runs and runs and

01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:40.800
runs I've never had any problem with it and I've used it at work as well I've used it

01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:46.080
for file servers in offices and stuff like that hmm now the big question though can I

01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:57.780
use butter FS only if you're insane all right well very good I will put I'm I am I think

01:49:57.780 --> 01:50:01.740
irrationally excited about the possibility of rebuilding we're setting up and picking

01:50:01.740 --> 01:50:05.920
a new file server right figuring out how I'm gonna do all of this but I'll check back in

01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:09.840
at the end of the day for Linux users here and it's just really exciting to be like yeah

01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:14.640
free I can do it and it solves a real problem and stuff like open media vault didn't really

01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:19.040
exist the last time I really gave us a thorough look a few years ago like it just wasn't there

01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:24.700
and free nas was an option but so everything has changed which makes it all new and exciting

01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:30.440

I am not unfortunately but you know there's methods.

01:52:06.080 --> 01:52:09.440
There may be there may be there because we have we have a fair amount of listeners in

01:52:09.440 --> 01:52:14.540
Portland because here's the thing West is what do you think the J.B. one studios from

01:52:14.540 --> 01:52:17.320
Portland that's about it what three hour drive.

01:52:17.320 --> 01:52:21.120
Yeah depends on traffic but if we do it at the right time yeah three hours we should

01:52:21.120 --> 01:52:22.120
be there.

01:52:22.120 --> 01:52:23.120
Yeah interesting.

01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:24.120
That'd be fun Nike.

01:52:24.120 --> 01:52:25.120
That would be a lot of fun.

01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:26.120
That would be too much fun.

01:52:26.120 --> 01:52:33.880
Because what I want personally from you yeah so it's these kind of the whole user story

01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:39.880

01:52:44.360 --> 01:52:51.040
like this is a heap of shit you bollocks fix it you know hardcore user test case I see.

01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:52.040
Yeah.

01:52:52.040 --> 01:52:53.040

So I'm going to be getting me burgers that night then there for a whole two weeks.

01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:16.240
Yeah I'll be staying in Portland downtown hanging with Linus actually met him in Dublin

01:53:16.240 --> 01:53:21.920
last year I was presenting that Linux Con Europe so I saw him out the back there.

01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:22.920
Yeah.

01:53:22.920 --> 01:53:23.920
Yeah.

01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:24.920
Linux Con is the place.

01:53:24.920 --> 01:53:26.960
If you get to meet him that's usually the place to do it.

01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:29.280
He doesn't otherwise really like to attend.

01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:34.360
Well we also have conferences at work as well because my office is the Intel Jones well when

01:53:34.360 --> 01:53:38.320
I'm there it's the Intel Jones Farm campus over in Hillsborough.

01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:42.640
So we have the conferences up in Washington up in you know Skamania.

01:53:42.640 --> 01:53:43.640
Yeah.

01:53:43.640 --> 01:53:44.640
Yeah.

01:53:44.640 --> 01:53:45.960
So like we go up there and he's there as well.

01:53:45.960 --> 01:53:49.440
So I've met him there a couple of times but the first time I ever met him like I was kind

01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:53.560
of new at the whole thing and I was getting trolled and set up with him.

01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:57.080
So I kind of went running in the other direction to be honest with you.

01:53:57.080 --> 01:53:58.080
Sure sure.

01:53:58.080 --> 01:53:59.080
Yeah.

01:53:59.080 --> 01:54:24.080
Yeah.
