00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 44 for June 10th, 2014.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,520
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's yabba-dabba excited to talk

3
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,000
about Bedrock Linux. My name is Chris. And my name is Matt. Hey Matt, episode 44 and we've got

4
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,480
the founder of Bedrock Linux on the line waiting for us just to get to him. He's been patiently

5
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,960
here all pre-show. We've had a fun pre-show today and I'm excited to kind of uncover Bedrock Linux

6
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,280
a little more. It's a pretty interesting distro that we reviewed on Sunday's Linux action show.

7
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,560
I believe it was episode 316, if you haven't seen that one. It's not required reading but

8
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,680
highly suggested reading if you want to be well-rounded. And then we'll also get to some

9
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:19,080
feedback and if we've got some time. Matt, something's got me upset all day. Alienware

10
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:25,760
has slapped Linux users in the face. They've taken a trout that's like two days old and they

11
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,000
just slapped us all in the face with it. And I can't believe it so we're gonna get to that as

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,600
well. Plus we've got some Steam updates and a couple of other things. So good show today. I'm

13
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:40,080
excited about all this stuff. So I figured maybe if we were so inclined we'd start with our feedback

14
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,400
and our first email this week and we'll get to just a couple of emails and then we're gonna get

15
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,200
right to the Bedrock Linux stuff. But I had a couple of things I wanted to start with and the

16
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,240
first one came from John. John wrote in to kind of rib us Arch users. He says, hey Chris and Matt,

17
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,960
I just have to tease you for beginning your show by talking about Arch regressions and then go on

18
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,760
to worry about Mint having potential to break. Currently Linux Mint works and there are a few

19
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,440
problems I have with it. Yeah I might not work right on other distros but I, and I think he's

20
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,240
talking about Cinnamon, I honestly doubt if Clem even cares about that. A quick look at the Linux

21
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,880
Mint website will tell you they are self-sustaining distro then they are self-financed too. Maybe this

22
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,280
is Mint's way of pushing back at the ultra accelerated pace that distros like Arch rev up.

23
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,560
What is wrong with Debian style of a revenue distro? Maybe it's an issue of two different

24
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,160
worlds. One world that's building a future of Linux and then there's the world that uses Linux

25
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,120
to do things unrelated to the development of Linux. Those who want something that works because

26
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:42,120
it's been rigorously tested. Cheers John. So Matt do you think maybe this is the Linux Mint's push

27
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,320
back at these crazy rolling distro world that we seem to be moving towards? I think maybe

28
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:53,800
inadvertently. I don't think it's done on purpose or with any type of real direct push back but I

29
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,600
definitely think that they're going for, you know, they're going for some stability and they're also

30
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,520
catering to a different audience of people. Yeah and I think there is a bit of like two worlds at

31
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:07,720
play here too and I also think it's a good point that Linux Mint doesn't really need Cinnamon or

32
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,360
Mate to be used anywhere. It's anywhere else. I mean it's in their benefit and best interest if

33
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,340
it does and I'm sure they want to see it used elsewhere but they are self-funded by their users

34
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,040
and so that allows them the flexibility to really focus on just building what they think is best

35
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:27,080
for them and if that means creating their own desktop that only they have, if that's what Clem

36
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,440
believes is the way to accomplish that mission it makes sense that's what he's gonna do. So yeah,

37
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,000
I think it's interesting. We'll see. We'll keep watching it. I actually am really glad they're

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,480
doing it. I think it's a grand experiment because I've always, you know, I've always speculated

39
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,720
like if you know if I had a perfect Linux distro it would be something kind of like what Linux Mint

40
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,200
is doing or like elementary does where only would be more user land updates really fresh user land

41
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,500
but really stable base stuff as much as possible and that's essentially what we're gonna see for

42
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,400
Mint so it's an experiment that I've been rattling around the back of my brain for a long time and

43
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:07,360
now we're gonna see it come to life. So my cookie wrote in, my cookie, he says, hi Chris and we got

44
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,200
this a lot and this is just a nice concise question so I wanted to get to this. On a previous

45
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,240
Unplugged you hinted that Chase might end up on Linux Mint after thinking on what to choose. Yet

46
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:21,040
once I watched the episode he ended up on Ubuntu. Why did Chase choose Ubuntu over Linux Mint? Now

47
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,240
I wanted to get to this here because we've talked a lot about how to Linux here in the show and the

48
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,920
current format of how to Linux is really the representation of months and months of thinking

49
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,240
like and then Chase you know thinking about swishing and so we've come to a lot of we've

50
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,480
had a lot of discussions and conclusions outside the show and then what you see in the show is the

51
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,600
manifestation of all that work and the essential reason was we figured a lot of people watching

52
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,160
will be starting there we're not sticking with any one particular distribution and Chase kind of

53
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:54,440
felt like because the choice is so overwhelming he was he was willing to hold off on making full

54
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,680
gone conclusions and try out Ubuntu see what he thought and then also be willing to try the thing

55
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,760
so you have to stay tuned to find out what happens there my cookie but we one of the biggest biggest

56
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,720
pieces of feedback was why didn't you put the explanation in the show it's because we'd already

57
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,400
decided before the show and it is just a process and we wanted to make it quick because we feel a

58
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,800
lot that's where a lot of people are gonna start so thanks for asking my cookie Matt before we get

59
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,480
on before we get onto the rest of the show and we got one more email I want to stop right here

60
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:26,000
and think ting that's right go over to Linux dot ting comm that'll save $25 off your first device

61
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,040
or $25 off your first month of service and we got an email came in from Brad he says dear Chris and

62
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:38,640
Brad I've switched to ting I've been saving for I've been saving up for a phone so I could make

63
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:43,520
the switch and I finally accumulated the scratch and bought a Nexus 5 booyah I've been getting

64
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,760
boned by t-mobile for years now and now I'm free free I say I mean it was like walking in McDonald's

65
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:56,120
and paying for nine hamburgers and only eating one every month what the who does that I activated my

66
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:01,600
phone entirely online in like ten minutes and like Chris likes to say Bob indeed was made my uncle

67
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,400
with ting I'm totally only paying for what I use which isn't much and currently with the last

68
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,960
discount I get the first month for free I actually end up only oh I'm sorry I only ended up owing

69
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,200
them a buck seriously a buck a friggin dollar so thanks gentlemen if you're ever in LA I owe you a

70
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:21,460
cupious amounts of beer sincerely Brad and his last name is pronounced kale oh like the healthy

71
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:26,280
snack so go over to Linux dot ting comm to check it out ting why is ting different because there's

72
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,160
no contracts there's no early termination fee and like Brad said you only pay for what you use it's a

73
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,600
flat six dollars plus whatever the man's gonna put on top of that he's got to get his cut he or

74
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,760
she the man's really not an actual person and then it's just your usage so your megabytes your

75
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,800
messages your minutes whatever buckets you fall into after all that's added up that's what you pay

76
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:51,280
and be like Brad I recommend go get the Nexus 5 $349 that's you own it price that's not you

77
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,880
spreading the cost out over two years that's what you own and just like when you buy yourself a

78
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,560
computer you'll want to own it it's your device that's what's great about ting you get this Nexus

79
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,500
5 one of the best Android phones out there even still today $350 when you go to Linux dot ting

80
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:10,200
comm then it's six dollars a month after that that's all you pay your usage plus ting has an

81
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,120
awesome dashboard that lets you manage it and best of all if you ever get stuck or if you want

82
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,040
to have multiple people on your account you'll appreciate this one they have rockin good customer

83
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:24,040
service you can call anytime between 8 a.m. or 8 p.m. Eastern at 1 8 5 5 ting FTW and a real

84
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:28,760
person answers the phone and that person it's not like a oh hi thanks for calling ting please hold

85
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:33,160
or what's your problem and that person's like hi thanks for calling ting how can I help you I'm

86
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,840
actually the person that's gonna help you and yes a real person just answered the phone when you

87
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,960
call the company support number that's that's it's incredible and like Brad said their control

88
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,920
panel so awesome Matt and I have both activated and deactivated multiple devices all through the

89
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,000
online control panel with zero problems it's awesome and if we ever did get stuck we know

90
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,440
we have that customer service really nice Linux dot ting comm that'll tell them hey thanks for

91
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,760
supporting Linux unplug I really appreciate you guys keeping them on the air that also gives you

92
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:05,080
a chance to try out their savings calculator just plug your current bill in now think about this too

93
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,400
when you're plugging your bill into their savings calculator put the numbers in that you actually

94
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,760
use not what you pay into because that's a gimmick that your cell carrier has tricked you into thinking

95
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,800
is the way to pay for things when you're doing their savings calculator put your actual usage

96
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,060
in there and then be it's astonished at the difference Linux dot ting comm and a big thank

97
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,880
you to ting for sponsoring Linux unplugged you guys rock and go over to their blog too they've

98
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,080
got another behind the scenes video they just posted up that you guys might want to check out

99
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:38,920
so Matt join us on the mumble line is the founder of bedrock Linux paradigm hey paradigm welcome to

100
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:45,360
the show thanks for being here man we really appreciate it so tell us so when did you start

101
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:59,480
working on paradigm so I started there isn't really a good firm starting date I didn't realize

102
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:05,520
what it became when I started playing around with it yeah so I'm guessing around 2008 to 2010 was

103
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:11,240
when the ideas started for me waiting for it got me where and then the first public release was 2012

104
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:17,440
and I gather like a lot of projects it was really like this is just something I want like I'm sick

105
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,120
of having to pick between Debian and arch or whatever you just looked out of all and said

106
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:28,440
I want all but at once right yes exactly that's bold and how has the response been to this because

107
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:34,480
I know I mean I've seen presentations far back as 2012 but yet I still don't see a lot of talk

108
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,600
about it I am seeing more these days so I do you think response is improving are people starting

109
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,320
to grok the idea I think the main concern the main thing keeping people away is that it's still

110
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:49,480
labeled alpha it there's still a lot of work that has to be done I expect that when that's when we're

111
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,960
past that it's a stable release if there's gonna be more tension that's what's gonna happen I'm

112
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,160
okay with the slow development sure it's actually kind of a good thing in a way isn't it because it

113
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,840
sort of slowly brings in more people and and and sort of doesn't make it an insane base that's all

114
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:08,400
of a sudden using your code so would you mind in your own words summarizing what bedrock Linux

115
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,720
is and what makes it different for maybe folks who didn't watch the Sunday's Linux action show

116
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:18,340
sure I'll try to use different phrasing than I did when you quoted me earlier on the show Sunday

117
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:25,880
so when you use a Linux distribution what they actually do for you is provide a lot of software

118
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,640
that they've packaged it's all out there so the question is whose package you put together to make

119
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,880
sure it all works but you have to pick which group of packages from which distribution if you want

120
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,680
something stable you know like rel or Debian if you want something cutting edge just like arch and

121
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,480
so on and so on every just rises its own advantages and disadvantages maybe been better like Linux is

122
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:48,080
that you can install software from any of those distributions so that it runs natively just like

123
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,980
it was needed for the distro no VM overhead no containers restricting what you can do just if

124
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:57,000
you if you want parts from different distros at the same time that rocks how you there's one way

125
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,360
to go about it now if you were starting bedrock today 2014 of June would you start with something

126
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,440
that was more Docker based or do you still think that this is perhaps a different approach or a

127
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,600
better approach than just straight-up container ization so I actually just added today a new

128
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,400
frequently asked questions thing on Docker since that that's coming quite a bit right

129
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:22,680
Docker is doing something different Docker is purposefully containing things so that they can't

130
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,680
interact with each other there's a lot of benefits to this I'm not saying it's a bad idea but it's a

131
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:32,680
very different goal if you're using Docker you can't for example say install some program then

132
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:37,240
Ron man to get the man page for it you have to actually go into the the Docker container for it

133
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:42,600
so no I would not switch the techniques I still think that the technique I'm currently using is

134
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,240
about the best way to go about it given the resources I have at hand and I think the thing

135
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,880
to underscore here is this isn't virtual ization and so it is native metal performance and I could

136
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:57,000
have an application running from an arch client and an application running from a Firefox client

137
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,840
and they could interact they could pass data amongst each other yes exactly for the most part

138
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:06,600
it all feels native like if you don't realize if you don't do anything to point out data usage it

139
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,440
feels like any other distro so does this get massive like that on the disk am I do I end up

140
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,600
essentially with the equivalent of an arch a full arch installation a Debian installation an Ubuntu

141
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,760
you know a fedora whatever I decide to install as a client do I do I need to have just a ton of disk

142
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,000
space that is definitely an issue with the techniques we're currently using we have some

143
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,360
ideas and how to fix that in the long term but we're not gonna get them done anytime soon yeah

144
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:36,640
I mean how would you even go about that the main concern with that is actually telling me package

145
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:42,800
managers that certain dependencies have been met elsewhere and you have to go do a lot of work

146
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,040
specific to each package manager to get that done in automated fashion it's also not entirely clear

147
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:53,280
that a given library will meet the needs from like a different distro so what ends up happening on

148
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,840
bedrock right now is that you'll have multiple versions of any given dependency if multiple

149
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,120
things need them they're not shared but there are some theoretical things that could be done

150
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,720
if it's a high enough priority could I run multiple versions of the same distribution so

151
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:13,720
could I have 1204 and and 1404 as clients and and mix and match match between those two sure

152
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:24,320
yeah I just I think I look at I look at bedrock Linux as as maybe a power desktop Linux users

153
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,320
perfect scenario is that who you're targeting in your mind when you're developing this so the the

154
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,160
key target audience for bedrock Linux is myself if other people want to use it great I'm just

155
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:42,920
trying to make it for me and it's for your desktop or server you run it on a server laptop I do I'm

156
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,360
not convinced it's the best option I think something like Coral West will give you advantageous

157
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,120
what bedrock does isn't as helpful on a server because things aren't just like they don't need

158
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,920
to interact quite as much as they wouldn't have desktop but it works fine okay well I've got some

159
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,480
some functionality and usage questions for you so I'm gonna and also I'll move us up into the main

160
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,800
mumble room too so they can jump in and ask questions so I guess where I wanted to start with

161
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:13,480
is are there already tools in place to do client all client updates so I could execute a yum upgrade

162
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:22,320
and an app git dash upgrade and a pac-man upgrade from one for one bedrock command so we had one that

163
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,600
did that but I decided I wanted the name of that utility used elsewhere we end up dropping it

164
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,400
temporarily in the long term we want to have we have a project that we're calling the package

165
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:38,440
manager manager or PMM and in theory you could run some PMM commands that would do that okay and I

166
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:43,840
kind of also had a question I noticed how do you choose the kernel so my bedrock installation was

167
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,520
using an arch kernel is that something that installation you just pick the distros kernel

168
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:53,520
you want originally I think I mean the first alpha I recommended compiling your own kernel

169
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,560
which kept a lot of people away but after some experimentation I realized that for the most part

170
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:04,160
any one external works and just about any distro you might lose some features like system tap but

171
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,880
yeah you can just use whatever so my recommendation is that you install kernel from a client and just

172
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:15,680
use that and so how about how many people are working on the bedrock Linux team now I'm the

173
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,520
majority of it I think well over 90% of the lines of code currently in their mind but there are a

174
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:25,080
good number of other people who contribute what they can when they have time I'm trying to give

175
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:31,320
an estimate depending on where you draw the line it's maybe five total wouldn't be go ahead ask

176
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:37,080
your question I was just curious what problem were you setting out to solve when you first created

177
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:42,760
bedrock Linux so there's a famous story with RMS having trouble with a printer which is why you

178
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:50,440
started the canoe projects I had a similar issue I had to I was using Debian stable at the time

179
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:55,800
my printer broke I got a new one and the drivers didn't work and I did spend a lot of time making

180
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,360
that work when I realized if I could just get this one package from Debian state or arch that

181
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,240
would that would solve that completely and so I did that I set that up and I just kept iterating

182
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:14,160
over it from there until there's it's its own distro I also like the story you shared where

183
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,960
there was a bug with comp is and one distribution had one part of the solution the other distribution

184
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,520
of the other part of the solution you're able to bring those two together and I've been in that

185
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,800
scenario myself especially though see the reason why I asked you about the desktop question is

186
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,320
because I have very very much been in the server space where we were just on the pre show talking

187
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:36,960
about Red Hat Enterprise 7 and so many times I've been on a CentOS box or Red Hat Enterprise box and

188
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:43,320
I've just thought if I could just manage this one set of applications through apt or if I could just

189
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:50,720
get this PPA or whatever it would make so much of my work easier and bedrock sort of seems to me to

190
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:57,760
have the promise if I could base the core bedrock kernel on a CentOS kernel so essentially I'm CentOS

191
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:03,120
on the whole stack but bedrocks actually managing the user land I could essentially accomplish that

192
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,520
couldn't I paradise yes and in fact that's what I'm doing on the server it's exactly the reason

193
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:14,840
it's mostly diving stable but I do have occasional occasions from elsewhere go ahead crossroads so I

194
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:22,520
was wondering how you'll handle the image system will you use system D or will you write your will

195
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:29,320
you write your own in it the custom in its system for bedrock that's that's actually a really good

196
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:34,520
question currently one of the main areas that better our clinics has issues isn't it most

197
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:39,560
things just work as long as they're not closely tied to in it when better started there was no

198
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:49,240
system D most things were system 5 or similar and that ended up working quite nicely system D I have

199
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,760
to be here with my phrasing here say it's really picky about how it does certain things and it

200
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:59,520
doesn't want to play with bedrock very well so we have to come up with some new solutions that

201
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,560
particular issue currently bedrock Linux uses its own busybox based in it which is super duper

202
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:10,320
limited but in the long term we're going to try to make other in its systems options just like you

203
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,400
can have for the main user lane whatever packages you want I'm going to try to make it so that you

204
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,600
can use whatever neat system you want Wow Riley go ahead yes I was wondering like have you had

205
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:28,200
any issues with the bigger disk shows getting mad at you pulling down their packages and installing

206
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:33,840
it on bedrock when it's not really that dish show like I remember a while back that canonical got

207
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:45,400
mad at MIT for accessing their repos the servers sorry it's just that's that's misrepresenting what

208
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:51,920
happened but go on but the broader question is have you heard have you heard any put have you

209
00:18:51,920 --> 00:19:02,600
got any pushback from upstream distros I've I've not had anyone be upset by that yet I think we

210
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,960
may not be big enough yet to get that attention if that's something that's coming later off the

211
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:12,320
handle it however that the question is really what is the distro that you're using is bedrock

212
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,440
when it's just acting like a hypervisor you're really using some other distro in which case

213
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,160
you're using the software they're providing and the repos they're providing for that purpose so

214
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:26,240
there's some arguments can be made right it is their user land yes yeah it's just not their

215
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,320
kernel which what's the difference if you downloaded Ubuntu and swapped out the kernel

216
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,760
it's almost the same the same from the distribution standpoint go ahead blue Phoenix I know you had a

217
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:41,240
question we wanted to get in what about switching in its system like gentoo does some applications

218
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:46,680
I mean gentoo uses open RC but like if you're gonna use gnome then you can switch to system D

219
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:55,240
so the the trouble with unit stuff is it gets really complicated specifically things like

220
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:01,280
upstart and system D the way they're designed is really inflexible given what bedrock clinics is

221
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,160
trying to do and some of the tools we're using like system D will actually check when it's

222
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,760
starting if you're using some of the techniques that bedrock clinics it does do and then refuse

223
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:17,760
to operate so it's not as simple as just switching it out there's me a bit more work I see heavens

224
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:25,080
revenge has a question go ahead heavens okay well there is a situation in which I can't quite

225
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:30,680
wrap my head around let's say you start from a base system and of course you know you usually

226
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:36,600
start with installing X at least before you used to go distro or desktop environment first you'd

227
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:42,400
go X first then maybe the toolkit and then maybe the desktop environment what happens when you go

228
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:50,800
a stable X pull something bleeding edge like a bleeding edge KDE or GTK from arch and then go

229
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:58,160
back and switch to a stable desktop environment where that is trying to find updated API calls

230
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:08,280
in the stable version of the toolkit that you're using so if I if I followed that correctly your

231
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:14,440
concern has to is going to be met by the fact that if something has a dependency that will be

232
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,960
provided by the same distro which is one of the reasons we have to take so much disk space is we

233
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,320
have multiple copies a lot of dependencies so something is using a given toolkit and they're

234
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,880
sad it's it's missing they'll end up having their own so that that doesn't happen very good all

235
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:33,800
right look static no literally there'll be multiple copies of something like GTK so something

236
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,240
wants one specific version of GTK and something else wants a different version they'll both be

237
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,880
installed on disk that seems I mean I know some people are gonna scoff at the disk space usually

238
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,000
there but that seems like if you're if you want to do this kind of thing and disks are cheap that

239
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
seems like a fair trade-off for what you're actually getting and so when you install KDE

240
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,480
do you actually install a KDE and all of its complete dependency tree from that specific

241
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:02,680
repo or distribution and then have little kind of hierarchies within their own roots yes if you

242
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:08,000
install something like KDE you'll get the entire if you're installing it using that given distros

243
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,040
package manager and it does its own dependency resolution the way it typically would natively

244
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,920
you'll get all of those dependencies it's like if you were running that distribution and you just

245
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,720
installed KDE it will do all of the actions it would do when you perform that action so if it

246
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:25,960
if you if there's a meta KDE package that installs 300 dependencies it would do that okay I was

247
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:31,280
thinking of excess shared containers which they share a little bit more interdependencies between

248
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:38,680
them but I guess they're very very inter independent of each other okay so I wonder how oh go ahead

249
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:44,640
yeah how closely independent they are or how how much they're interacting with each other is

250
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,800
configurable given the way they're using it so if you want to try to do something like that you can

251
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:53,760
by default I'm trying to find a same compromise between things not conflicting with each other

252
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:59,200
and things just working interacting we'd expect all right I want to get a couple more questions

253
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:05,500
in before we go so I wanted to have crossroads that kind of finish this up with his last two

254
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:11,600
questions here go ahead crossroads okay so my first question is how does bedrock handle GUI

255
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:19,040
so when it's when you have a GUI running how does that work how does one particular client display

256
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:28,320
a GUI it's talks to Xorg or Wayland the same way it would natively like it doesn't they're not

257
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,400
contained it doesn't know that it's not there it doesn't know that the version of Xorg is talking

258
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:38,720
to happens to be different from what it's used to and my last question was oh if you could take

259
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,920
a time machine five years in the future where would you want to see bedrock or where do you

260
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:50,040
see it being in five years I see it being roughly where you see something like slackware who's a

261
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:57,480
popularity like people notes they're not everyone uses it however it's you know I obviously be very

262
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,560
different from slackware in terms of what the projects doing I expect I'd like to have a niche

263
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:07,000
number of people who are using in a community but I don't expect it to take over everything I like

264
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,120
that and so I think we have a lot of people that want to know how they can help contribute where

265
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:18,120
should they go to get involved or see if there's a way they could help so on our website I have I

266
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,240
think a quick question item on that but basically you can look our issue tracker there's something

267
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,880
you think you can take go ahead and let me know and go at it if you see some other issues that

268
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,680
are missing from there you can add them I think that the biggest thing though that that can be

269
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:36,560
done is to actually install it and use it and let me know what issues you find because I can't fix

270
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:41,600
issues that come up and workflow is different from mine like I don't actually use many desktop

271
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,680
environments so if there's some issue with those I wouldn't be aware of them so yeah just use it

272
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:50,320
and let me know how it goes very good well you are welcome to stick around and join us any time

273
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,960
to the mumble room is always open when we're doing the unplug show and I'd like to get your

274
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:59,040
guys's thoughts on on this next topic we have coming up to and we'll discuss more in the post

275
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,400
show so it's been great and guys go over go over to the show notes we've got links for bedrock

276
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,280
Linux and I think about you Matt but bedrock Linux to me is like one of the most interesting

277
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:12,760
distributions in ten years oh easily I think it could actually set the pace for the way things

278
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:17,240
are done in the future maybe not exactly the way it's being done currently but I think it does set

279
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,680
a pace and a different set of expectations that we could watch expand over time I like that I like

280
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:27,480
that that sort of you know slack where it has sort of a really soft spot in the community's heart

281
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:32,920
there's a lot of passionate slackers out there and you know I think it's it's still a distribution

282
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:36,440
that carries some weight every time we talk about on the show we end up hearing from somebody that's

283
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:41,200
that's not a bad goal at all I would I'd be very happy to have a distribution at that level and I

284
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,200
think it's possible bedrock Linux offers something that I think will really appeal to a certain set

285
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,720
of Linux users so you heard the man go out there and try it out go to bedrock Linux a site and

286
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:56,120
download it and deploy it and bang on it for him it's not not necessarily for those of you who are

287
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:00,960
maybe not a little more gray in the beard it takes some Linux skills but if you've got some or if you

288
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,800
want to challenge him you can go do it and you go always try it out in virtualization too so you

289
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,000
could always snapshot and whatnot speaking of which man I want to thank our next sponsor on the Linux

290
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,400
unplugged show and that is digital ocean go over to digital ocean calm and guess what we've got a

291
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:19,440
nice June promo code unplugged June to get you a $10 credit over at digital ocean digital ocean

292
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,400
is simple cloud hosting and they're dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way to spin

293
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:29,000
up a cloud server users can create a cloud server in about 55 seconds maybe less if you're a pro

294
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:36,000
like our audience and pricing plan started only five dollars a month for 512 megabytes of RAM a

295
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,400
20 gigabyte SSD a blazing fast CPU and 1 terabyte of transfer in digital ocean has data center

296
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:48,000
locations in New York San Francisco Singapore and Amsterdam man I'd love to be the IT guy that gets

297
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,200
sent to work at the Amsterdam data center and of course their interface is simple their control

298
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,560
panel is intuitive and power use can replicate on a much larger scale with their API and you're

299
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,720
seeing people take advantage of that in really cool ways there's so many great things I could

300
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,040
talk about with digital ocean I think what I'd like to focus on is how much I really appreciate

301
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:10,360
how they've rocked so many aspects of this it made it they've it is a combination of their

302
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,080
dashboard that I talk a lot about it's a combination of those SSD drives which is an early

303
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:19,040
investment I think they really saw the light on that it's the really great utilization of KVM to

304
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:23,080
get the density on these things so incredibly high and one of the other things that's really

305
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:27,640
fantastic about digital ocean is they have been on the cutting edge of Docker support Docker 1.0

306
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,920
came out yesterday digital oceans already down with it man and a great thing about digital ocean

307
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,880
is they're making it really easy to deploy some really great open source tools and things like

308
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:42,640
GitLab you can deploy GitLab to dot to a droplet on digital ocean in no time it's it's things like

309
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,920
this where you can make a template image and then redeploy it when you need and they have hourly

310
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,920
pricing so you can take this template get it up and running bang on it for a few hours and shut

311
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:56,160
it down and with our toned up with our $10 credit when you use unplug June that's gonna last forever

312
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:01,360
I mean it's this value combined with this technology and it's the technology that we all

313
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,560
support it's the technology that we all love combined with their investment SSDs these data

314
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:09,400
centers all over the world they really are a really cool company and they're doing something

315
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,080
different they have a different recipe than everybody else and that's why developers and

316
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:17,600
Linux users and power users and people that just want to learn alike are all responding so strongly

317
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,800
to digital ocean go to digital ocean comm and use the promo code unplugged June go get a $10

318
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:27,600
credit trap that $5 rig for two months you'll just get it for for two months for free that's

319
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,680
a terabyte of transfer you can use and just put bit torrent sync up there put own cloud up there

320
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:38,080
just begin to take back and control a little part put subsonic up there shoot I don't know put plex

321
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:44,560
up don't know I don't know about that maybe maybe I put a VPN then you could do it well here's how

322
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:48,120
what I did and I and I wouldn't necessarily go with that direction in the media but I think so

323
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:52,080
we have some folks that do have plex up there you know it could work right it could work but

324
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,480
I would want to make it secure yeah you wanted to make it secure I mean for myself I'm actually

325
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:03,080
looking at doing an own cloud because I really want to make sure I have access to my documents

326
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:07,720
number one going I'm also looking to drop Dropbox so this is a project I've taken up and I was

327
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:13,080
originally just doing it just a bit torrent sync part of my house but was soon as soon as I started

328
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,480
putting stuff up on my digital ocean droplet then I was like oh wait a minute now I can get

329
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,880
to it from my Android phone when I'm on the road without having to mess with any firewall stuff on

330
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,880
my home router and it it just and then it's like oh and then I have another sync point it's up in

331
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,040
the cloud and it's like essentially off-site backup for me it just all these things started

332
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:34,240
to click into place so check it out you guys all right so I'm a little upset I'm a little I don't

333
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,160
want to I don't want to be all ranty and ravey I hate what I hate when I'm grumpy I know you guys

334
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:46,320
do too so let's just jump in real quick we're just gonna do our valve update so Alienware got

335
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:52,120
on my ass list today they had a little e3 announcement guess what ladies and gentlemen

336
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:56,520
Alienware will be shipping their first steam machine in December despite the fact that valve

337
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:02,200
has supposedly delayed them because they're taking a little shortcut Alienware's first steam machine

338
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:07,040
will be shipping with Windows of course it will it's a it's a it's Dell jr. I mean what do you

339
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:12,560
expect yeah they did it again Matt they did it again they did it again they switched to Windows

340
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,200
they're they're shipping what they're calling the alpha version of the steam machine running

341
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,880
Windows and the alien will develop Alienware developers has to have and this is a quote

342
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,960
scripted up a new UI that makes the Windows interface more usable from a tent and from

343
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:33,840
ten feet away and will make it easy to launch Steam big picture mode there you go hell you

344
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,480
know it's Alienware I mean nothing they do really surprises me especially once that once

345
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,240
uh Dell kind of took them under their wing they really went a totally different direction at that

346
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:47,560
point it's really disappointing and I I mean like not only is it it's negative in the freedom

347
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:54,640
dimension that's a given but also like I I can in a way understand like maybe like they were

348
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,480
working hand-in-hand with valve and I was like yeah Alienware we're gonna do this you be our

349
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,760
partner and then then all of a sudden I was like actually you know what just kidding we're gonna

350
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,960
bump it to 2015 that's that's I mean that happened right valve so we're gonna bump steam machines

351
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:10,200
and maybe Alienware was like well that's great Gabe but here I am with my with my wiener out

352
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:15,560
and nothing's happening and now I'm kind of stuck to deliver I've got all these R&D guys we've paid

353
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:19,840
for we've developed a product we've got all the shipping and marketing oh and by the way we've

354
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,520
been working on a Windows one just in case your product sucked anyway so we're just gonna go with

355
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:28,440
our plan B I feel like that's what happened well and it honestly makes me wonder how much which is

356
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,360
really the plan B you know I mean really think about that if they were able to roll it out that

357
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:36,640
easily but well I think they've been working on this from the beginning oh yeah that's kind of

358
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,800
what I'm saying yeah I mean maybe or maybe they hacked it together I don't know maybe they did

359
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:44,760
hack it together but I to me it feels like how do you just go well yeah but we've had these we've

360
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,400
had some of our developers hacking together UI for this so we'll just go with that and you know

361
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:55,160
got big picture mode this is yeah I don't know this is really disappointing and this is this

362
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:59,600
is typical crap and I don't know I just I'm a little worried I don't like this is not a good

363
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,320
start for the whole steam machine thing this is not this is not how I wanted it to begin but just

364
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,160
sounds like still how passing things all over again with yeah I say that's all they've ever

365
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:14,080
done well and but now the headline is is Alienware refit steam machine with Windows you're seeing

366
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,740
that adventure beat it's on and gadget it's everywhere now that's the headline that's the

367
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:22,960
headline now and it sets the tone and so that's gonna challenge valve to have to step up their

368
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,120
game when they are ready to release and absolutely just really blow people away and that means

369
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:34,640
getting in the headlines quick and early if the Reese they're scripting a new UI or whatever why

370
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:40,800
are they doing that on Windows when that would be easier to do on a Linux system yeah I think it

371
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:46,640
has Dell I think valve blew it I think I think what valve valve blew it by engaging with other

372
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,480
companies valve should have just nutted up and just shipped a machine themselves and and not

373
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,920
shipped it until it was ready and they should have it should have been the steam machine from

374
00:32:53,920 --> 00:33:00,040
valve and not worked with guys like the cube guys that blew it back at CES last year and these guys

375
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:05,080
that are blowing it now this is not the first partner that's blowing it and this this is a

376
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:10,680
big deal if they screw this up this is a big deal well I treat these guys just don't care what

377
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:15,520
operating system they're shipping with they care whether they can supply the games that people want

378
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:21,120
to put to their to the people who will buy steam boxes and the truth is that if you are going to

379
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:27,320
ship a steam box today you have to have more triple a I agree and Linux just doesn't deliver

380
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:35,080
there so they either have to wait and possibly another company could sweep in and ship with

381
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:45,680
Windows and everything that valve supplies with Steam OS is actually available for for Windows

382
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:51,520
already probably no one will stop you if you want to ship a set the box with that boot straight to

383
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:58,000
this steam big picture a steam box running Windows is a failed product on launch you know why because

384
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,800
we already have those those those already exist and they haven't gone anywhere it needs to be a

385
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:08,520
differentiator it needs the steam box applies to somebody who wants to have a more appliance

386
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,400
console like experience they don't want something that's running Windows that's just been lacquered

387
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,400
over like media center was or what's what big picture mode is they want something it's a

388
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:21,520
dedicated appliance box that's been blessed by valve the people who are maybe Mac users who

389
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,760
can't play very many video games or people who are Xbox users who maybe don't really even mess

390
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,680
with their PC very much maybe they have like a laptop you know like they don't even game on the

391
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:35,240
PC that's who I see a steam box running Linux appealing to is somebody who wants a different

392
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:40,320
solution because we already we've had big picture for over two years now I don't know a year at

393
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:45,440
least yeah and it's gone nowhere right and we already have that and so now Alienware is gonna

394
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,600
bundle up and package something with a too expensive price point because they are charging

395
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:53,440
more for this because of the Windows license they said it in the press release they're gonna

396
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,000
ship something that's more expensive that will play mediocre game graphics based on the specs

397
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,680
of this thing and what there and it has this it has the steam box name it's a stinker all around

398
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:12,560
I think it has to do with support no it doesn't I had Alienware that they sold with Ubuntu on it

399
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,600
and then I had an issue with the CD drive when I called in the tech support uh when they found

400
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:22,160
out I was using Ubuntu the first thing they said is we don't support Linux and I end up getting

401
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,920
the escalated and it was a hardware problem because of the case design but their their

402
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,240
first response is we don't support Linux yeah even though they sold it with Ubuntu on it right so

403
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:37,920
go ahead run no go ahead run uh doesn't I could be wrong but doesn't Valve have a rule like a

404
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,080
guidelines that you have to agree to in order to call it a steam machine or a steam box I don't

405
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:47,040
know Google has AOSP I know I know that the press is calling it a steam machine that's what I was

406
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,520
saying is uh they need to draw the line and saying and saying if you're gonna call this a steam box

407
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,480
you need to make sure it runs Linux and not Windows you know if you look at the headline

408
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,600
it says steam machine but I did I think that's I think that's a that's a very it doesn't matter

409
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,920
that what matters is the perception that headline creates steam box steam machine it could be that's

410
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,920
interchangeable for the for the impression it's going to create and despite how much I dislike

411
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:13,840
companies doing this can't uh steam contact the the uh companies who are putting that headline

412
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:19,120
out there uh or the media organizations and tell them that's not what this is please remove that

413
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,960
you're insinuating you know you're you're talking about our product the steam machine that's not

414
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:29,040
that yeah I don't know I don't know I mean maybe I mean I can answer that question so

415
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,320
go ahead man well I I can answer that question um I I receive those all the time and usually after

416
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,440
I'm done laughing at them and sending them to my inbox um yeah the point is is that send me a cease

417
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,480
and desist until it's legal they can bite me um that that's that's the most of the philosophy

418
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:49,600
of most editors unless there's a real compelling legal concern from the legal department no one

419
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:54,880
cares it's an interpretive statement so the title being the steam machine well it's running steam

420
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,640
and it is a machine that can be interpreted they can then fight it out in court or they

421
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,640
can accept the fact that there really isn't much right and and the thing too is like valve is not

422
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,360
going to want the bad pr but I want also the thing is is what the way alienware is positioning this

423
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:13,840
is they're even calling it alpha this is rev one we're shipping our first version with windows

424
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:20,160
and then later potentially maybe possibly kind of we might put linux on them in future versions that

425
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,240
we won't be calling alpha anymore we just want to see if the concept works even though it won't be

426
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,240
anything like the final product we want to see if the concept works and so that's why they're

427
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,680
calling it a steam machine because eventually maybe it kind of could possibly run steam os

428
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,960
you gotta wonder does anyone else here smell microsoft stink on this because they do have a

429
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:43,040
real tight relationship this is what i've been saying um microsoft and dell are known to be

430
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:51,760
like very simpatico together um what's that i would agree with heavens this is not the

431
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:57,120
microsoft thing at all it's just better currently if you are going to ship like i said before if

432
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:03,200
you're going to ship a steam box it's easier to do it with windows because of bigger library to

433
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:12,320
games you'll appeal to wider uh i think people who do it don't care absolutely at all um about

434
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:18,000
what operating systems they're shipping with and we care too much um the truth is probably

435
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:25,280
yeah yeah we care too much about linux to have a kind of a clear perspective on this

436
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:31,600
all right vr mac vr mac you want to give us a dose of reality go ahead i think the uh the thing

437
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:35,120
that this all boils down to is the fact that dell's a business and regardless of if they

438
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:39,040
have any sort of alliance with microsoft or whatever conspiracy you may think they're

439
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,920
they're a business and all they really care about is making money and they see this as

440
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,880
an opportunity to get a profit this is a really good opportunity for them too because as we know

441
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,480
of x for playstation 4 and xbox one guess what they're using x86 chips yeah i just this is the

442
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,720
future of gaming tell isn't very good at making money in the consumer space anymore i mean they're

443
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:02,400
kind of laughed at or converging this is this is this has now become the ultimate dell product

444
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,760
where they half ass it they they start ambitious and then they cut it and cut it down this isn't

445
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:13,120
going to be a successful product this is already a product that nobody wants i mean it's like okay

446
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,960
fine they want to go with windows great give me specs that i actually give a rat's butt about

447
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,480
then i might at least acknowledge that they're actually trying the problem the problem is is

448
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:26,160
when it runs windows you fundamentally have a complicated windows pc that you have to manage

449
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,400
that's why windows the old traditional windows mobile failed it was too complicated for that

450
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:36,880
type of device you you have to have a device that is dumb stupid i just want to effing play

451
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:42,960
some video game simple i press a stupid little alien glowing button and it boots up this this

452
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:49,040
shiny valve os and it boots right into this big picture mode and that's all it is it's nothing

453
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:53,440
else it's not windows that's been scripted to have a 10 foot interface that you can launch

454
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,400
big picture people don't want that it's going to be a failed product when they plug in their

455
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,880
controller they're going to have to install some drivers yeah it ships with the xbox 360 wireless

456
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,280
controller too that's what they're going with anyways it doesn't stink with microsoft at all

457
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,560
yeah it's not even a little bit i said i i know some things about dell and microsoft that most

458
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,960
people probably don't and i'm saying yes it does stick at microsoft of course you know what uh imicon

459
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,480
points out in the chat room you never know maybe it will be successful and the steam machine name

460
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:28,160
gets a good name and yeah right i don't think so uh yeah how about some uh how about some some good

461
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:33,280
linux gaming news right so let's talk about linux taking over the gaming universe again uh i didn't

462
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,400
really see this one coming today at least uh civilization 5 the strategy game is now native

463
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:44,800
on linux it's an aspire port but it's a native aspire port the steam os release includes all

464
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,800
civilization 5 dlc too and the expansion pack including gods and kings and brave new world this

465
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,440
is over on gaming on linux.com uh and it was posted by uh liam who joined us a couple weeks

466
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:02,080
ago on the show pretty big release for linux civilite this is one of the benchmark games and

467
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:06,240
it's out it's out there right now you can go get it and download it i actually think i bought it

468
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:11,520
like a while ago when it was on crazy sale sometimes i hedged my bets and so there you go

469
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,680
that's a big game coming to linux and uh so that's a good that's some good news and i also

470
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:20,400
wanted to share a little love with the krita product project krita am i saying that krita

471
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:28,480
krita krita the uh the kde or the qt based uh digital painting software is doing a kick starter

472
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,560
to sort of supercharge development and the main reason i wanted to give them a mention is because

473
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:38,480
this is one of the most badass apps we have on desktop linux and i i i'm i'm very hopeful that

474
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,280
crowdfunding can be a way for the open source community to fund these really standout applications

475
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,960
and when you have a desktop linux application that not only has a good history but it has an

476
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:55,360
ambitious target and has been delivering on a consistent basis i'm all about that so i wanted

477
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:58,960
to give them a plug you can find a link to their kickstarter project or you can just go to kickstart.com

478
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:04,160
and search for the krita project it's from the krita foundation they're trying to get to uh 15

479
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:10,480
000 and they're at 2148 right now 73 backers with 29 days to go and they got all their goals

480
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:15,600
outlined out there and stuff like that so good luck to them it's a really really good app um

481
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,040
it's one of these apps that i kind of wish we had spent more time with on the linux action show

482
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:23,680
demoing uh but i'm just so not skilled at this kind of stuff that it would be embarrassing right

483
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:28,320
but if i was i would i would be showing this kind of stuff off so just give it a mention for one of

484
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:33,200
our great desktop linux apps that's out there that you know this is this is one of the applications

485
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:38,560
that any desktop environment proprietary or not would be proud to have definitely so there you go

486
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:43,440
good work guys and good luck on the fundraiser they got a they got a video too that you can go

487
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:48,480
catch with some catchy like uh you know kickstarter music and they got some green screen action going

488
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:53,680
it's nice look at this green screen action they got going good work kickstarter videos is that you

489
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,760
always want to like curl up with a cup of tea as you watch you know the whole thing i mean the

490
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,120
whole kickstarter video thing you know that's like an industry now there's like people with their

491
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:06,560
full-time business is uh recording kickstarter videos and indiegogo videos and stuff like that

492
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,960
like the whole that's like their whole thing man that's what they do for a living that's crazy i

493
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,480
mean if only we knew more people had that kind of equipment instead of thought of that i should have

494
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:20,320
thought of that dang it all right well you guys can find links to all that stuff in the show notes
