00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 13 for November 5th, 2013.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,880
Hi everyone and welcome to Linux Unplugged, the Linux talk show that just can't wait to build

3
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:46,560
email 3.0 on top of an open source system. My name is Chris. My name is Matt. Hey there Matt.

4
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,560
Hey man. 13 weeks buddy, 13 weeks in a row and you know this week, this week I feel like we're

5
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,280
going to talk about one of my all-time like soapboxes that I always get on. We need to

6
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,360
replace email. We need to just we need to get rid of it and there's been a lot of there's been a

7
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,600
lot of you know alternatives. BitMessage is one that I've talked a lot about but it just hasn't

8
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,040
really gotten traction. It's got a lot of issues around it but the Dark Mail Alliance, the Kickstarter

9
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,560
has officially kicked off. I want to explain what it is, what they're trying to accomplish,

10
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,840
talk about it technically, how they're going to pull it off and then hopefully at the end of it

11
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,280
some people will go over and contribute to the Kickstarter project if they think it's worth it

12
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,600
and we'll see a new open source email alternative emerge in 2014. Good stuff. Yeah yeah and you know

13
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,280
it's funny because I'll tell you what I really wanted to talk about this week. I don't know if

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,720
you saw this but the Verge got their well Verge and others got their hands on Steam Box, Steam

15
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,680
Machine prototypes. I saw that. Oh my god. I know and I thought you know I can make a whole episode

16
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,360
about this but I I'm gonna we'll do a round up in the Linux Action Show on Sunday but uh I'm so

17
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,920
excited and you know what you know what I'm a little jealous they went down to Bellevue right

18
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,040
that's like that's that's like 40 minutes from my house oh my god Val's office is like 40 minutes

19
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,560
from my house we gotta get in there Matt we gotta get in there get some get our hands on some of

20
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,040
this stuff I'm marching through the door with cameras in hand you know excuse me Gabian excuse

21
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,600
me uh the Linux Action Show and Linux Unplugged and uh we need to see this device right now

22
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,080
exactly uh but we'll have a whole round up in uh this week's episode of the Linux Action Show

23
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,200
so however I'll tell you I was like oh we gotta talk about this day we gotta talk about this day

24
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,840
but then then something of serious consequence happened uh we thought it might happen mentioned

25
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,200
it in the Linux Action Show this Sunday uh uh Ladar Levinson announced uh his Dark Mail Alliance

26
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,760
Kickstarter so we're gonna dig into the nitty gritty of that and I pulled a few clips they kind

27
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,520
of had the most unique Kickstarter video I've ever seen um where they took essentially what it was

28
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:50,400
it was like a walk at a um uh I guess a meeting of people who run mail servers I'm not even sure

29
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,800
what it was it was definitely the most unconventional Kickstarter video I've ever seen

30
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:01,040
and it maybe wasn't the greatest however uh since I recorded a few clips from this video they've

31
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,400
raised seven thousand dollars in like two hours whoa so they're definitely on the right track so

32
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,440
the video didn't really matter but so instead of making you watch the whole uh 23-minute video

33
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,040
quick clips about what they're trying to do and I think what's even more interesting is the

34
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:22,400
technology behind it it's uh it's it's it's definitely an SMTP replacement it's not fully

35
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,360
compatible with SMTP but I think maybe in light of what's happened recently people might be they

36
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,880
might be ready for it interesting yeah I wanted to give a shout out not to the man on the line here

37
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:38,960
but to uh listener Matt who is in Seattle right now and he has been a listener of the Linux Action

38
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:44,880
Show since episode one and uh he uh he emailed us and said hey Chris uh I'd like to take you

39
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,640
out and buy you a beer and uh you know wine and dine me probably wanted to sleep with me to be

40
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,600
honest with you man it's the hair it's the hair Matt it's clearly the hair it's always the hair

41
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,280
we're all drawn to you I don't know I can't help it it's like a big magnet I don't know what to

42
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,120
tell you man it's uh anyways he emailed me and he said uh hey I'd like to take you out and I said

43
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,360
you know what can't sorry because we're doing Linux unplugged right we're doing Linux unplugged

44
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,480
we can't do it so I want you to know I just passed up free beer and food for this show

45
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:17,920
that's a big thing well so um last week we talked about systemd we talked about systemd and we

46
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,760
talked about upstart and we talked about Debian's upcoming choice and the ramifications it might

47
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,720
have in the broader Linux ecosystem a lot of good a lot of good responses to that uh episode

48
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,880
so we're gonna do more like that in the future um you know as these big topics come up that there's

49
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,440
a lot of ambiguity around I think the show can kind of stand out by helping cut through some of

50
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,840
that and and discuss the real issues without all of the drama around it and things like that yeah

51
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,280
so the bulk of our email this week our our follow-up so the beginning of the unplugged

52
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,800
show we like to do a lot of f you that's our follow-up and uh sometimes it meets its name

53
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,480
and sometimes it doesn't but uh so we're gonna cover some of that uh but uh we have uh two

54
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,760
sponsors in this week's episode of Linux unplugged both Ting and DigitalOcean so I thought I'd tell

55
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,400
you about one of our sponsors up front before we get into it and that first sponsor of course

56
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,760
is my mobile service provider and Matt's Ting.com now Ting is mobile that makes sense and you can go

57
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,480
to linux.ting.com to get started and one of the great things about Ting is there's no contracts

58
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:21,520
no early termination fees that's that's huge that's huge on its own that tells you a little

59
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,680
bit about Ting right there also you only pay for what you use if you only use 30 minutes of talk

60
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,080
time then that's what you pay for if you only use 200 megabytes then that's what you pay for if you

61
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,360
need a gigabyte you get that included in your plan as hotspot and tethering Ting often sees themselves

62
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,440
as an ISP not so much as a phone company but as just mobile data and that's that's brilliant

63
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,320
that's exactly what I need because I'm one of the people who likes to buck the system I want to try

64
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,760
to get the most out of my cell phone bill by using VoIP services and things like that and Ting is

65
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:59,600
is a company built from enthusiasts by enthusiasts and you can see it through and throughout their

66
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,680
culture in fact if you go over to the Ting help center I got an email from a listener today who

67
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,840
said hey Chris I switched my family over to Ting and we're loving it it's been great and I noticed

68
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,800
in some of your ads you've mentioned that you have a couple of tricks to skirt around using your

69
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,080
cellular data now in the holidays this is hard for me to avoid because family members just call my

70
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,200
traditional phone but I'll tell you yeah and that's what honestly Matt like you know what

71
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,280
that's what's great about paying for what I need because in in November and December and in January

72
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,480
too when my when my phone minutes go way up I just pay for what I needed that month it's it's not a

73
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,920
huge deal right but here here's a little glimpse into the Ting corporate culture on the community

74
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,760
forums they have a post that I've referenced several times when just setting up a new android

75
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:51,760
device called reducing my bill via free texting and calls over wi-fi where they have outlined

76
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:57,440
how you can use different apps in the android play store to use wi-fi whenever possible to

77
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:03,520
make a phone call now think about that this is a phone company that has in their community forms

78
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,880
a document that is instructing you on how to avoid using minutes that's crazy I mean you'll never see

79
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,040
that with any other carrier never see that with any other carrier no and when you combine that

80
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,600
with ting's pay for what you use no contract and they have excellent devices and they're always

81
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,400
adding new devices they're adding new deals in fact the phone that matt has the note 2 is on sale

82
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:28,800
currently you can save 31 on top of what you're going to save if you go over to linux.ting.com

83
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,680
you can take 25 off your first device or if you got your own device you're going to bring

84
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,520
you can take 25 off your first month of service you end up paying for what you use you're not

85
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,640
locked into a contract it's on your terms and then you combine that with their amazing dashboard

86
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,800
man you're really cooking with gas it's really awesome not only that not only that but ting's

87
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,960
going to help you get rid of a used device they've got the they've partnered with glide so if you're

88
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,800
going to switch to ting and get a new device they'll help you sell your old device they'll

89
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,600
help you buy a used device if you want to save some cash like i started they got right now for

90
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:06,560
example the evo 4g with y max 123 bones off contract all yours you can pick up the nexus s

91
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,320
245 bones off contract all yours they've even got feature phones i mean there's all kinds of options

92
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:17,200
from ting and now is really time to get started because the sooner you switch the sooner you'll

93
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,600
start savings and speaking of savings they have a savings calculator they've got it linked over

94
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,600
at linux.ting.com you click that you put in your bill information your minutes your text message

95
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,120
your megabytes and then you can really see what ting offers you combine that with the early

96
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,840
termination relief program will give you up to 75 per device you have to get cancelled from your

97
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,080
current contract and now you're really cooking with gas so go over to linux.ting.com and thanks

98
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:44,160
to ting for sponsoring linux unplugged thank you i love my ting phones i've got a couple of them

99
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,360
oh and i'm just in love in the fact that i'm not married to any one particular plan depending on

100
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,760
how i'm using it that that's really awesome i totally agree our first email this week comes

101
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,000
in from jim and he's says hi christen matt thanks for the great show on systemd versus upstart

102
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,720
adoption and debian i wanted to weigh in regarding matt's comment on that upstart was the obvious

103
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,000
choice for debian i agree with his logic that it seems the most conservative way to go in the near

104
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,040
term but i think he missed the importance of canonical cla i never use debian myself except

105
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,280
for as a foundation for other districts of course i've considered it and even burned to a cd with

106
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:22,320
iso about a year ago but never installed it when i read when i read that time was part of debian's

107
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,560
mission statement was that it would be free forever i'm paraphrasing here of course consequently i

108
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,800
think matt's otherwise logical assumption that debian would go with a tired and true upstart

109
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:37,600
over perhaps less than well-tested systemd in the short term may not happen so he's saying the cla

110
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,480
might be a bigger blocker now you you were pretty confident i i am and i think that's a that's a big

111
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,000
consideration and it's one they're going to have to wrestle with i mean keeping in mind these are

112
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,320
folks that actually had a fit about the whole firefox trademark stuff and actually adopt you

113
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,920
know and and went to ice weasel because of it you know and i'm not saying that's bad or good it's

114
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,640
just their opinion so i mean it's a factor but i'm still not convinced yeah what would happen if

115
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,520
they forked it and like and like then they maybe like that's like a compatibility pact like hey

116
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,360
canonical that's kind of what i'm thinking yeah i i think that's what's going to happen i think

117
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,720
upstart at some point at some level is going to either they're going to use it as it is or they're

118
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,480
going to find a way around any uh issues as far as licensing and whatnot you know i i don't know

119
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,400
if you saw the headline and i'm trying not to read too much into it i wasn't even going to mention it

120
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:25,360
but this just fits right in uh today we saw that debian is considering switching to x or i think

121
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:31,600
they have decided to switch to xfce for their default desktop now one of the reasons i would

122
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,040
imagine doing that is because gnome 3 has a dependency on systemd and by switching to xfce

123
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,200
they remove that dependency and i can't remember what episode it was but i actually mentioned that

124
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,720
at one point i bet that they would i can't and it makes sense for debian too i think

125
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,440
it's just it's what that's their whole approach is to not get in the middle of these of these

126
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,400
linux wars basically just to step back and say what's the most neutral logical place for us to

127
00:10:54,400 --> 00:11:01,360
be and i think that's kind of what they're doing i agree i agree i agree and uh i mean this if

128
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,560
anything prevents them i mean i'd love to see them choose systemd on it from a technical standpoint

129
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,760
but i really think gosh i mean after i saw this move to xfc i thought oh i think matt might be

130
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,400
right i think matt might be right now that's not to say they're going to outwardly directly just

131
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,240
automatically adopt it without any hassle or drama or whatever i think that they're going to

132
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,760
find a way to maneuver around it through it over it it won't be a direct thing but it will be

133
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:32,080
through upstart interesting interesting all right uh so you know now the big question is when we

134
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:37,680
find out what they're going to do uh mt wrote in and uh he said that in the subject line the feature

135
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,400
of linux should be independent hello chris and matt love the show but i wanted to go out on a

136
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:47,440
little rant here uh because i hate how we the linux community are always supposed to be held

137
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,880
back because of the bsds one major point in your systemd versus upstart discussion was that systemd

138
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,240
doesn't support the bsds however i i disagree this is a problem we as the linux community should

139
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,680
strive to push linux forward to make it the best contender for our needs the bsds do not like us

140
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,240
they don't need our help with any project like katie gnome etc but then demand that we consider

141
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,480
them they bash us they hate us on their mailing list but then when linux wants programs but then

142
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,600
they want their linux programs to run on bsd they rely for years on gcc but as soon as they switch

143
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,040
to something else they bash gcc as if it was not providing them with a faithful service for years

144
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:28,000
i just think that we are so worried about the bsds while they're clearly not giving a crap about us

145
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
so why should we cripple the progress of linux platforms because of the bsd i'd love to hear

146
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,840
your opinion on this mt boy you know i think first and foremost we're talking about a vocal minority

147
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,360
much as we see in the linux community where there's a vocal minority that tend to be the

148
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,120
loudest and proudest and you know most vocal i think it's the same thing in the bsd community

149
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:52,080
i think most bsd people honestly don't care i think the vocal people probably the ones that

150
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,840
are being affected by the various things you know certainly i can see i can see where it's

151
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:00,000
point but i wouldn't go say the entire community as a whole i would say that's basically affecting

152
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,600
a vocal group and as far as what we should be doing with linux and whether we should be ignoring

153
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,280
them or not honestly you know i agree with the linux going forward stuff and you know i agree

154
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:15,600
with that i say look at it like this um bsd isn't asking how they can make beehive their new

155
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,840
virtualization layer run on top of linux they're just going ahead and making the best virtualizer

156
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:26,000
possible for bsd and i i actually want to take what mt is saying and maybe flip it a bit and say

157
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,800
i think sometimes when we i think sometimes it's justified to say what you know what kind of

158
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,680
decision the gnome project or kd project are doing is going to impact kd because it is the goal of

159
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,680
those projects to be available for those distros and so as debbie as a platform they want to help

160
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,840
support the goals of the software that sits on top of their platform so i wouldn't discount

161
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,280
debbie's concern and consideration for the bsds but i would zoom out and say

162
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,520
we shouldn't discount our bsd cousins it's almost kind of like insulting in the sense to say well

163
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:58,000
if we don't provide them with this they'll have nothing because they can't do it on their own

164
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,800
right and i think sometimes like developers fall into that trap a little bit like the bsd community

165
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,720
is fully capable of creating their own awesomeness that they need for to suit their own needs just

166
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,040
fine and that's why the linux community should feel free to go off on their own direction and

167
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,840
create their awesomeness because the bsd community is going to do it too and i think it's kind of a

168
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:22,400
little demeaning to sit here and go well if if we don't provide gnome just right then the bsds will

169
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:27,680
be left out you know what the bsds can solve it themselves and this is true you know yeah so i

170
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:33,440
agree i think mt raises an interesting point uh but he does seem a little a little upset about it

171
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,040
yeah i i mean obviously this is something he's probably read about or maybe even come in direct

172
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,200
contact with but at the same time let you know you're dealing with a vocal minority of people

173
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,960
that feel that way and that's that's their opinion you know don't no need to get sucked into it yeah

174
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:52,720
yeah uh so james writes in james writes in he says um i've listened to last linux unplugged show a

175
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,280
couple of times over now it was a very good show in my opinion i do have a minor complaint though

176
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:01,440
once again the size of ubuntu's user base was brought up in an attempt to give their side more

177
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,960
legitimacy namely as a reaction to the charge that ubuntu is the only distro using upstart

178
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,920
sadly everyone bought right into it as usual and didn't even bring up some very major caveats that

179
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:17,920
go with that number one ubuntu does not have a huge user base or i'm sorry ubuntu does have a

180
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,640
huge user base that's absolutely true however they have a huge user base of highly non-technical

181
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:27,120
desktop users with little to no actual linux experience they don't know their desktop gets

182
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:34,400
from they don't know how it gets from grub to light dm nor do they care you know that's kind

183
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,560
of true but it's like yeah yeah that's stereotyping because i think there's lots of technical users

184
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:44,560
that use ubuntu i would agree in that a growing the the growth is coming from new from newbies

185
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,920
no question the growth of numbers is coming from newbies however actual numbers i would say that

186
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,760
it's pretty well balanced that's not to say that people aren't migrating to other distros but i

187
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,760
would say that the growth is coming from the newbies but the sustained base is coming from a

188
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:03,360
mix he says on the other hand you got fedora reddit enterprise linux open sucess less enterprise and

189
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,400
of course you got arch all currently using are going to systemd that's a seriously massive user

190
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,800
base of a bunch more more technical users in every area desktop workstation service clusters cloud

191
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,840
deployments etc i'm not really sure where or when the current trend of dismissing the actual linux

192
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:22,960
power users or professionals began but i think it's past time it stopped unfortunately i'm almost

193
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:27,360
positive dab you know end up going with upstart canonical seems to have their claws sunk in pretty

194
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,360
deep with that community if they do it's going to be a very detrimental to the future of their

195
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:37,520
project in my opinion and i and i kind of grow tired of saying this over and over but honestly

196
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:42,480
these things take care of themselves the market will in fact in this particular case the community

197
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,040
as a whole will decide which option is best for them and it very well may be a mixture so do you

198
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,040
think though i get tired of the victim crap with the markets okay well so with the market approach

199
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:57,920
what we sometimes end up with is like a half implemented solution right we get um i mean so

200
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,560
if debian bought in with systemd essentially there would be one standard to rule them all

201
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,200
right there would be one interface to c groups there'd be all this kind of api's that systemd

202
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:12,560
would provide if debian doesn't buy into systemd because the market decides they should go with

203
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:19,840
upstart then there will be a more pronounced division in the underlying internals of linux

204
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:24,960
right and that's true that's true i guess my big gripe of the the big underlying gripe i have is

205
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:30,240
that rather than concentrating on promoting talking up sharing yeah you know the things

206
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,800
that you're into the distros that you are into why do we spend you know why does the community

207
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:40,160
spend so much time hand wringing over something that news flash kids you have zero control over

208
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,960
you don't you can pretend like you do all day but you don't so we we have to decide let's you know

209
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,840
how do we take the stance i agree that we need to you know be mindful of what we use on our individual

210
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,760
systems but the but you got to be careful not to fall into the victim trap and i don't mean

211
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,000
that in a derogatory sense i mean that factually you you come out you come out on the losing end

212
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,760
of it really yeah yeah the victim camp yeah you got to avoid that you got to avoid that

213
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,600
this doesn't work yeah and it's hard when you get really you get wrapped up into it you know and you

214
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:11,440
see you know anytime anytime an issue becomes clear from beginning to end to you and you can

215
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,920
see an injustice or you can see a logical it's very hard not to get upset by it and the only

216
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,120
reason why other stuff doesn't upset people is because they just don't get as invested in it but

217
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,840
if you got invested in politics or sports you get just as upset right this is true i mean good example

218
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,920
earlier we had a big skype crash i mean it was a pain in the butt and boy how do you know i could

219
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:32,800
sit there and shake my fist oh microsoft you how dare you crash that application that i chose to

220
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,960
install and use and we could have a debate should we drop skype switch the mumble yeah like all

221
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,040
these technical discussions or do i suck it up and either continue to use it or use something else i

222
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,040
mean really it's really what it comes down to so yeah anyway that's my take on it uh i wanted to

223
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:51,280
say um i'm sorry i i made a little uh i made a little boo boo last week get it out of here uh oh

224
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:58,320
yeah uh so oh my god matt so after last week's linux unplugged i lost all access to my google

225
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,600
account oh no full on couldn't get to docs couldn't get to youtube couldn't get to my email

226
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,360
and of course i couldn't get to the jupyter broadcasting youtube account well this happened

227
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,320
while i was posting linux unplugged so normally if if you notice what happens on the jupyter

228
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,880
broadcasting website is right when a show comes out i i post on the website and i use the youtube

229
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,000
embed and that's because webm is horrible technology and takes way too long to encode

230
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,320
literally like if if the hd version of linux unplugged it might take 25 minutes to encode

231
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,320
and the webm version not exaggerating at all will probably take two and a half hours to encode

232
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,960
it is that kind of half hour two and a half hours so youtube's down because i can't get to my google

233
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,920
account so i say screw it i'll just go straight to the html5 version and i posted it on our website

234
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:47,840
linux unplugged html5 version and because the webm wasn't ready yet i just didn't link it well

235
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,400
on a ton of linux desktops if you don't have the webm well anyone using chromium or chrome on the

236
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,840
linux desktop if you don't have webm uh embedded it won't play it just sits there and spins for a

237
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,080
while so a bunch of people couldn't play last week's episode on the html5 player i apologize

238
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:08,000
i did get the web web version up later but because it took so long to encode it it was like a couple

239
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,480
of days later so my apologies to those of you who had problems we got a lot of people emailed and

240
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,200
said i couldn't play the episode the direct download links by the way folks uh so where the

241
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,320
so you have the video embed then where the show description is you scroll down a little bit direct

242
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,560
download links you just download them right there we got torrent feeds and everything uh but that

243
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:29,120
was my bad that was my bad well and i think that's an important piece to to really realize is that

244
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,480
sometimes those things happen and that is so frustrating for the end user i totally get that

245
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,000
but the cool thing is that we do have that alternative option so if you run into a problem

246
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,840
just remember we probably got you covered no worries and then also i try to link the youtube

247
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:46,960
version which you can go watch and all of that um so this week uh i wanted to uh i oh god did i

248
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:54,000
get yeah here we go this is our speculator tron you like that the speculator tron and we're gonna

249
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,680
look into the future the the the distant year 2000 future and we're gonna talk about replacing email

250
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:05,840
lava bits darkmail initiative uh launched on kickstarter this week and our community's been

251
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,320
talking about it in our subreddit i actually already became a backer 35 bucks worth nothing

252
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,760
outrageous but i became a backer and i want to talk about this today because this is a

253
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:22,080
as a former sysadmin but also now as a business owner these are placing email is kind of a big

254
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,160
topic for me uh because i gotta i gotta replace it with something that solves the needs of a small

255
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:31,200
business i want something secure and safe because i i get hundreds of emails from people outside the

256
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,560
country in a week and you know so i i never know who i'm getting emails from and i also want

257
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:42,160
something that's easy enough that uh is just sort of doesn't have a cognitive burden as they put it

258
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:47,520
and so i want to talk about the darkmail initiative i want to break it down and the fact that it's

259
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,280
open sourced it's going to run on linux all of that is going to be a point of our conversation

260
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,320
today uh but before we get into that i want to thank a new sponsor on linux unplugged and that

261
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,960
is digital ocean now if you're not familiar with digital ocean they've cracked it they've solved

262
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,000
a digital ocean is simple cloud hosting dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy to spin up

263
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,360
cloud servers and the this is i'll tell you a little bit about the the digital ocean cloud

264
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,480
server i spun up last night by the way check this out matt users can create a cloud server in less

265
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:22,480
than 55 seconds pricing plans start at only five dollars per month which gets you 512 megs of ram

266
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:28,800
20 gigabytes of ssd storage a cpu and a terabyte of transfer a terabyte of transfer for five dollars

267
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:33,600
a month the interface is so simple so if you're watching our video version here i've got my

268
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:40,000
personal digital ocean control panel up and so you go you go to create and then you select your size

269
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,960
so here i have a 512 megabyte cloud server one cpu 220 gigs of ssd and a terabyte of transfer five

270
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,480
bucks a month now that's crazy that's a great deal that's a great deal if you use the code linux 13

271
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:58,880
this is episode 13 linux 13 they'll give you a 10 credit that's basically two months you can get a

272
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,280
digital ocean server for free for two months so what i did is i went in here and i said i want

273
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,320
the 512 box and then you select your region they got new york amsterdam san francisco and another

274
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,400
new york location so i went i decided to go east coast i'll tell you why here in a second

275
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,480
then you go down and select your image now they've got everything from ubuntu 1310 through ubuntu

276
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:26,640
1004 they got centos from version 6.4 to 5.8 they've got debian from version 70 to 60 but matt

277
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,840
then they got fedora too but matt they have the arch they've got arch believe that it's like oh

278
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,120
my god it's like all those times you're wondering i wonder how arch would handle this well there you

279
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:41,840
go right so so that's what i did i i spun up an arch an arch server they've got the uh they've got

280
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:47,680
the may snapshot so you you know that's the so you click that image you get the minimal arch system

281
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:52,800
just image to your box so it's totally set up you generate the root password you log and you've got

282
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:57,120
root access at this point you can set up and even any encryption you want anything like that you know

283
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,040
what i decided to do what did you do one of the things i've been trying to figure out a way to

284
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:06,320
utilize and but also make a good experience is bit torrent sync bit torrent sync it offers just

285
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:11,040
incredible possibilities for content distribution and i've been experimenting with distributing the

286
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:16,960
unfilter supporters show and and clips catalog using bit torrent sync so i spun up an arch

287
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,400
linux box on the east coast running bit torrent sync this got a copy of all of the unfilter

288
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,440
supporters stuff on there so when new members join the unfilter supporters club they get seated from

289
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,760
a new york server and from my server here on the west coast so i've got now i've got servers on

290
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,320
both coasts of the united states seating the unfilter supporters club so it just makes it

291
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:42,080
super crazy fast and matt i brought my arch box up to total current the first thing i did matt

292
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,240
when i when i logged in right i just brought that sucker up to date i was pulling down packages from

293
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:53,120
the arch repo at 9 10 megabytes a second whoa yeah and that all goes on those ssd hard drives

294
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,560
so when you when you combine that crazy speed with those ssd hard drives it is absolutely

295
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:03,440
mind-blowing digital ocean also offers a vast collection of tutorials in their community

296
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,960
section this is awesome matt users can submit articles to the community and get paid fifty

297
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,440
dollars per published piece so if you feel like you have an article you could write that would help

298
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:19,120
the digital ocean community if if digital ocean selects it they'll give you 50 bones i know so

299
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,640
i'll put a link to that in the show notes if you guys want to check that out and if you want to go

300
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:28,320
check out digital ocean use the code linux 13 when you check out that'll get you a ten dollar credit

301
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,080
so if you get the five dollar box that's going to get you two months of digital ocean for free not

302
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,440
only not only can you select like base images but under the applications tab you can just say well

303
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:45,120
i just want a lamp stack on ubuntu 1204 just spin that up or i want ruby on rails on ubuntu 1204

304
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,920
or i want ghost on ubuntu 1204 like you can just push those out right then and there uh you have

305
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,600
you can have stored images so once you have something you can snapshot it and then redeploy

306
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,000
that later on you can back things up you can destroy images if you don't like them they

307
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,680
support docker containers so you can create something locally and ship it up to them using

308
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:07,120
docker and then on the back end they're using linux and kvm to make it all possible and i love

309
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,000
the interface i love as you're bouncing from tab to tab it's it's physically impossible to get lost

310
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,080
confused as to what you're doing you don't even have to know what any of this means it's so awesome

311
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,560
it's so awesome it's like awesome uh and uh we were just talking on the pre-show with some of

312
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:26,000
our mumble uh folks and uh they were mentioning it was a jbviewer66 he was mentioning that uh

313
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,280
he's uh he's had he's been digital ocean customer for a long time and support questions get answered

314
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:36,560
super quick super fast right i i couldn't believe like their claim you spin up a server 55 seconds

315
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:42,160
is totally legit i spun up an arch box in 55 seconds and i owned it and then i got geeky matt

316
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:47,200
i got super geeky like i sshed into it with x11 forwarding so then and then i installed firefox

317
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,600
and only the x11 dependencies i had to have and then i'm forwarding my firefox session and

318
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,200
configuring my bit torrent sync through localhost that way i don't have to open up a remote listening

319
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:01,520
port it was awesome it's so cool good deal you feel that ssd speed too so uh go over to digital

320
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:08,000
ocean.com and use the promo code linux13 to get a ten dollar digital ocean credit and thanks very

321
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,880
much to digital ocean for sponsoring this episode of linux unplugged we'll have a link in our show

322
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,960
notes as well i'm gonna be checking that out after the show that is fantastic oh yeah buddy it was

323
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,840
so i was like i walked over to my wife and i'm like okay i gotta apologize i'm really geeking

324
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,960
out tonight i just did the coolest thing did you get the geek twitch you know when you're about

325
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:32,400
to do something really i absolutely did uh so uh switching gears to uh to the lava bit dark male

326
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,880
initiative uh i thought let's back up a little bit and then we'll open up to the mumble room too but

327
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:43,840
let's start with uh ladar's introduction of the goals around darkmail and what it is um i've been

328
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:50,800
working with mike jenke and his team at silent circle phil zimmerman and john callous um and

329
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:57,200
we've been working on a little project we're calling darkmail we thought blackmail kind of

330
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:06,160
gave the wrong connotation and what we're doing is we're setting up a little non-profit called the

331
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:13,200
darkmail alliance um that would be the group that we're using to maintain and control the

332
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:19,120
intellectual property related to this new protocol i think if i had come to you guys two

333
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,920
three years ago and said hey it's time to toss out all the mail protocols and replace them with ones

334
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:30,000
that integrate security all of you would have laughed at me you would have said you want to

335
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,320
throw out how many man hours of work all for this hypothetical threat that we don't know exists

336
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,720
well i think after the summer of snowden hopefully you guys have a slightly different attitude about

337
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,480
how important security is and how insecure many of the protocols that we use every day

338
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:55,600
so uh that's ladar uh the uh owner i guess of lava bit which was shut down uh as uh

339
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,240
big as it became public that edward snowden had used uh lava bed as his mail server and then they

340
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:06,720
wanted right carb launch access to all of the mail records there and he makes a very good point is

341
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,920
in the past and i think this is very legitimate to the conversation in the past if if somebody

342
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,680
come along and said we want to replace email but we don't want to use smtp people would have laughed

343
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:21,040
them right out of the room oh they really would have too yeah and and it's it's now to the point

344
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,760
where it's like okay well i'm willing to seriously consider this in fact i was reading some of the

345
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:32,080
comments in our subreddit and uh uh josh uh struggle wrote i personally threw in 35 bucks

346
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,480
i look forward to love that code being open source the darkmail alliance making the protocol open and

347
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,480
the fact that they are tailoring this to everyone ranging from service providers to your grandmother

348
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:47,680
and end encryption is absolutely needed um somebody else wrote uh uh that he says uh this

349
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:54,000
was uh buffus brie 66 he says i'm gonna throw in 100 when i get paid this is the first smtp killer

350
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,520
i really believe in and smtp really needs to die a painful death i think it i think this will also

351
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,280
be a great time for companies like google and yahoo have been leaking bits and pieces of

352
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:10,720
conversations starting how they hate the nsa and gchq uh so i thought you know these are i'm too

353
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,000
like these guys are ready i'm ready yes but it's it's not only has how we needed the right time

354
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,480
but we've needed the right team and i think that's the other thing that the darkmail alliance has

355
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:26,800
is the right team basically what you've got is you've got uh a real interesting mix going on here

356
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:32,320
you've got the phil zerman who john and i is the co-founder silent circle along with john and i

357
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:38,560
uh creator of pgp you got john callous who's the creator of pgp universal server and apple's whole

358
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:44,560
disk encryption and you got ladar who if you haven't figured it out is one hell of an engineer

359
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:49,120
i mean it's kind of the dream team it really is and i think that was the missing piece as you

360
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,400
pointed out these are the people needed to come together to actually make this come to fruition

361
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,400
and come to reality and what one of the things that's i think probably important to understand

362
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:02,560
so this is what this kickstarter is funding is uh developers it is not necessarily funding the

363
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,800
product directly itself but funding hiring the developers to work on cleaning up lava bit source

364
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:13,120
code and open sourcing it and at the end the end product will be was essentially a series of

365
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:20,160
protocols this is really a set of protocols and it's a set of protocols that has as the goal you

366
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:25,920
start out with security and for those who need to dial the security down you can dial the security

367
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:33,200
down the problem right now is that email has no security and you're forced to dial it up and you

368
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:39,600
can only dial it up to a certain point there's lots of metadata in every email that absolutely

369
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,160
cannot be protected at all such a great point right email starts insecure by default and then

370
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:49,360
you can try to force all of these security layers on top of it but at the end of the day the metadata

371
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,720
is still exposed right well it's just a band-aid solution i mean that's the bigger picture is that

372
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,880
no matter how much how much wrapping you put around it that metadata being exposed is going to be

373
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,160
the downfall of anything you're trying to protect i mean it really doesn't work there's so much you

374
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:04,960
can draw from the metadata i talked to this person at this time over this time period right after i

375
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,280
dropped off the backpack in front of the trash can right exactly and that's really all they need

376
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:14,400
they don't even need the contents of it but what also inspires me about this darkmail initiative

377
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,560
isn't so much what they're saying now and the fact that it's going to be open source but the

378
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:22,640
fact that it's probably going to be based on a technology that they've already got working

379
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,480
what we're thinking about doing is basically building a new messaging protocol based around

380
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:34,000
json that like he said includes security by default i would say we already have it we already

381
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:41,440
have a working prototype of it that our our texting system silent text basically works this way that

382
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:47,360
that if i send you the equivalent of an mms you know i text you a picture what happens is that

383
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:54,400
you get an encrypted mms an encrypted xmpp message that tells you where to go get the picture and the

384
00:32:54,400 --> 00:33:01,200
picture is end-to-end encrypted between me and you and nobody else can decrypt it at all so what

385
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:07,920
they're going to do is uh the system will use xmpp for the communications between clients it will go

386
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:13,840
to a client and say hey so when i send matt an email it'll say or uh i guess a darkmail it'll

387
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:20,640
say you'll get essentially a notification that hey matt there is a goodies waiting for you on

388
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,760
this server now that could be chris's server that could be some that could be gmail that's

389
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,320
implemented this protocol that could be anything that kind of cloud storage and then your client

390
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,880
will go out and get this encrypted bundle and pull it down that'll be the actual message contents

391
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,920
now that gets encrypted on my end using a key that it gets generated on the client not from

392
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:42,560
the cloud and then you could only decrypt it using the key generated on your client and then you pull

393
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:47,840
that package down and you can decrypt it you get the contents and it's it's sort of um kind of more

394
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,640
like how a lot of messaging systems are going on mobile where you have a message and then the asset

395
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:59,040
gets stored on the cloud and this in this case the cloud is whatever you want it to be uh and i think

396
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:04,240
you know you when you've already got okay so you got you got people who spent 10 years in the

397
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:11,280
industry ladar creating what was the most secure email option of our time then he gets shut down

398
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:18,880
by by fighting back against the um um i don't know national security state i guess yeah yeah

399
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:23,360
and then you've got silent circle who also shut down in in spite of the national security state

400
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,520
who already have a war a working messaging protocol right they've already got it working

401
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,280
and they've teamed up and they're saying hey we want to do this and we want to open source it

402
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,120
and we want it the way we want to make this happen is by giving money money to developers

403
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,320
and then you know i think this is really chocolate and peanut butter coming together

404
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,280
i really feel like it is you know i feel like we're sitting here on the edge of like

405
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,920
the first honest to goodness serious email replacement like we've got the motivations

406
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,680
we've got the technology and we've got the people right and it's all but it's all going

407
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:57,200
to be open source and it's all going to run on linux i'm excited to see it come to fruition i

408
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:02,880
really am so uh i so i was curious i thought i'd i'd toss it here to the mumble room and ask you

409
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:08,240
guys uh is anybody not on board with the dark mail is anybody anybody have any issues concerns

410
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:15,920
or doubts in this room i just say it's about time yeah yeah why do you think we needed this years

411
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:22,800
ago i agreed actually that was going to be my question to you guys is so their best effort here

412
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,000
is they hire up a developer i mean we're best case scenario you're going to see something mid 2014

413
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,280
probably beta status right i mean is that too long you guys is that too far away because i feel like

414
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,320
i need something right now i wanted to deploy zimbra and move everything like this year and

415
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,880
i'm now i'm sitting here i'm seeing this i'm like maybe i should wait for for lava bit 2.0 dark mail

416
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:51,680
1.0 what do you guys think mumble room is it is it too far out i think it's too late because i mean

417
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:57,200
if you think about it this snowden thing that happened i mean if we had something like this

418
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:04,000
before the summer of snowden as he put it then we wouldn't have as much issue with oh well let's

419
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,880
just switch everything over to this now we've got to wait too long to have that happen and

420
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:16,320
and quite frankly everybody knows that email is already completely insecure so get the dark

421
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:23,200
mail going it needs to happen quickly we got a big message yeah i mean bit message is here today

422
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:29,760
but see here's where here's where the dark mail system is superior is dark mail is is it's mail

423
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,000
and then if you want you can dial it down theoretically and it can also do smtp and

424
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,800
communicate with older mail systems so it gives you that it gives you that transition whereas where

425
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,880
bit message is off on an island of its own you got to use bit message to take advantage of bit

426
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,800
message the sender has to be on bit message they've got to find it they got to find you

427
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,280
whereas this in theory could be integrated to existing mail products today and it could even

428
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,960
downgrade so it starts at the highest level everything is encrypted from the email to the

429
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:01,040
metadata from top to bottom everything's encrypted and it's encrypted exactly you also might bit

430
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:06,880
message is its own island it's its own ecosystem whereas this integrates with everything yeah and

431
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:12,640
also because it's worked on xmpp you can even use it as a dark mail for instant messaging right yeah

432
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,920
okay so uh that's a great point is mail is just going to be one aspect of what the system could

433
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:24,240
deliver whereas bit message is pretty much just for messaging and you'll probably you'll be able

434
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:29,040
to see more people willing to adopt something like dark mail than just than that message i think so

435
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:33,840
i think so i think the fact that it could support pictures and video is kind of a big deal because

436
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,640
if you're going to replace email don't you want to replace it with something that has more

437
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,840
capabilities exactly my two senses is that if you're going to replace an email then you're

438
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:45,760
going to need a bit of time for some of the companies such as google and microsoft to work

439
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:52,480
with these guys uh to develop a standard in a way that it suits businesses going forwards i don't

440
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:58,640
i don't see them being on board though especially microsoft and google i mean there's at least right

441
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:05,360
now the nsa is probably so integrated within those corporations right now that it'd be hard

442
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:16,320
to have them even be interested in it this is a crazy idea but i think the way that uh the first

443
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,640
person the first company who's going to jump on and actually provide a good service using darkmail

444
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,960
is yahoo that'd be interesting they have oh i see what you're saying because they're kind of the

445
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,920
underdog right right they need something to give entice people that would that would be a pretty

446
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:36,240
nice feature i kind of wonder if we aren't fighting the business model here uh and it sucks because

447
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:42,000
what all of these cloud providers uh base their business model around is mining every bit of

448
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,840
information about you even if it's just their robots doing it's for to display ads they have

449
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:52,480
to be able to read the contents of the message and it's not even like oh well that's gonna suck

450
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,360
if we couldn't do it no it is like fundamentally key to their business model it's how they analyze

451
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:03,440
and sell you things and so it is a massive it is why they did mail it's literally why they created

452
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:09,120
an email service that's why they did it and so to take that context away from them essentially

453
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:14,000
makes them run the mail service at a total loss and so i don't see the commercial incentive for

454
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,800
them to have their customers contents encrypted on the drive right i mean they're happy all day

455
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,920
long to let you connect over an ssl connection whoop-de-do what they don't want is that data

456
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,840
sitting in rest encrypted because then they can't mine it and i think that might be the

457
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:32,560
biggest thing they have to fight against well they could tell you now is this darkmail is it mostly

458
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:38,160
the protocol that they're focusing on yeah the back end yeah so i wonder if it could be paired

459
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:43,120
up with something like the mail pile for a good client well lava bit is talking what they're

460
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:48,800
talking about doing is re-releasing lava bit as the as a software package that integrates in the

461
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,600
darkmail initiative so you'd have the lava bit mail server i don't know what web front end would

462
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,120
sit on i don't know if i'd never used lava but maybe it had its own web front end uh they want

463
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:01,760
to repack okay they want to repackage that as an open source project that to be quote unquote a

464
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:06,560
first class darkmail initiative citizen but they feel like that those protocols could be used by

465
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,640
anyone but they're gonna it's like their nexus device in a sense i think the biggest issue is

466
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:16,800
going to be red hat if red hat can uh introduce this as their uh server operating system and

467
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,320
include it in their package along with updating gnomes evolution to include it and it's going to

468
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:27,280
be a big step forward well here's a here's a thought i mean the reason i'm saying yahoo would

469
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:32,240
would be an option for it is because the the fact that they're an underdog right now but also the

470
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:38,640
commercialized part of it is they could pay they could chart they could do a darkmail service that

471
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:44,320
is kind of like google apps for business so they can provide a darkmail that's completely secure

472
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:50,080
but so they could immediately be uh like hippocompliant so here's what i like about it

473
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:55,280
yeah because it does provide a certain like um regulation compliance and i like that if encryption

474
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,440
happens this is why i like last pass too because encryption happens on my end and on my client

475
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:05,520
device and so then it is a little less risk in using a public service because they can't decrypt

476
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:11,200
the data but you as a backend service provider not only do you lose the mining aspects of it

477
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:16,560
but you also lose like a lot of nice things like reducing multiple copies of files and and all of

478
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:22,000
that kind of stuff that you get when you can just look at the data so i wonder if if we're i mean

479
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,880
i'm not saying that it's not going to be successful but it seems like it might be a little more indie

480
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:30,880
now they say they've already got like 32 companies they'll want to launch with lava bit or i'm sorry

481
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:38,160
darkmail support right just built in does it have a list of those companies on the page no they don't

482
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:44,240
they don't have anything up on that 20 bucks says half of them are vpn providers yeah maybe

483
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,840
because they're already in the privacy business why not right probably yeah yeah that that is

484
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,920
interesting is you could do that well i was thinking you know to go back to our to go back

485
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,640
to our digital ocean sponsor i was thinking like this would be there you go so you take a you take

486
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:01,920
a five dollar a month server you throw your did your darkmail initiative project on there and

487
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:07,040
you've got a mail server no kidding and it's just i want to see this happen but i feel like

488
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:15,680
i i guess like the the primary issue is there's email has been consolidated down to four or five

489
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,200
big companies now to really do it and so it seems like you got to get one or two of those big

490
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:26,400
companies on board and yeah and i and really for one of those companies it has to be a company that

491
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:33,360
isn't wanting to try to get government contracts for their service because otherwise they the

492
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:39,520
government could hang that over their heads for them to get the data well yahoo's pretty good at

493
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:45,200
like uh fighting request for the data as well so that's another reason why i suggest i thought

494
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:50,080
they might be my thing with it is as long as they keep it open source that's the bigger picture here

495
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:55,840
that's always been my one issue with bit message is this uh closed source and proprietary you never

496
00:42:55,840 --> 00:43:01,040
know what they're doing in the back no i thought bit message was open source he's thinking btsink

497
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:07,600
he's thinking btsink yeah that one like as long as they keep it open like i'm fine with it because

498
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:14,240
that's like you can see the best encryption ever as long as it's closed source i still don't trust

499
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:18,960
it yeah and you know we've seen like with true crypt like when the when the project is important

500
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:25,520
enough certain groups will you know sit down do an official audit of the code and that's why i think

501
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,680
that is key just for a trust standpoint not even not even from everything else but just from his

502
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:34,880
trust standpoint i think that's pretty key all right any other thoughts on the darkmail before

503
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:45,440
we move on guys was that mail not was that mail not audited on tor at one point so you know let's

504
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:50,320
talk about that name yeah because that name does like it it brings up darknet right uh

505
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:55,520
yeah now what do you think is do they make a do they make a mistake with the name um i think as

506
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,200
they pointed out it's probably better than other names they could have gone with but i do i don't

507
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,240
think it's gonna it was definitely sounds like something that was developed developed by

508
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,680
developers it sounds like something that is not really hitting the mark as far as the

509
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:11,440
consumer is concerned they said their uh their their inspiration was the dark empire right but

510
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,440
at the same time i i applaud the name simply because it's going to attract the people that

511
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,240
need to get a hold of it the people that are going to roll it out on their own service that are going

512
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:22,560
to actually work with it and then provide it in more of a uh to start out with probably in a very

513
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:27,600
niche or niche uh point of view maybe i should have called it ninja mail well after the summer

514
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:32,320
of snowden maybe we need something that snapped us awake right no mail right yeah that's why i

515
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:37,760
think red hat's a good contender for that because uh if they already established it and have it in

516
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:43,120
the repositories and businesses might see it and think hey we'll include this and maybe not they

517
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:48,000
don't know what it is but once they start offering that service then they'll get users to like them

518
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:54,240
well no go ahead also go back to the open sourcing did he say what he was wanting to licenses that

519
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:59,600
no no i haven't seen any license no i haven't seen any license i hate it when they say open

520
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:04,080
source i thought he said gpl oh did he because i haven't seen that okay okay this would be good for

521
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:08,160
bsd licenses where anybody could just take with take it and run with it so there'll be a million

522
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:12,960
different versions of it like you said before i can't stop them all yeah yeah sure well here's

523
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:18,400
what daniel said daniel wrote into the show and he said why people will not use darkmail or at

524
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,880
least why many people will be discouraged is because of its name seriously why can't they just

525
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:29,840
call it smail or secure mail or bmail or better mail this has of course nothing to do with the

526
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:34,640
technical functionality but with the average user's perception darkmail sounds well dark it

527
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:39,280
sounds dubious just not right here in germany isp's cooperation with the state try to promote

528
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:44,720
something called dmail any links to the dmail wikipedia page it says for quote unquote secure

529
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:49,200
communication the whole concept is not secure but offering interception possibilities for law

530
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:56,240
enforcement but if i would have to explain some average computer user to why to use darkmail

531
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:01,920
from the darkmail alliance instead of the d email from german tcom they'll look at me like i want

532
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:07,520
them to commit a crime we geeks are used to funny ironic names and technical names like xmp rfc 25

533
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:13,360
353 whatever but the average user is not maybe we should keep in mind from time to time greetings

534
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:20,160
from germany and great shows daniel so i email 3.0 yeah email 3.0 is almost catchier yeah so i

535
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,840
think the thing to remember too is as this email pointed out i agree with this latter part as far

536
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:28,000
as the naming scheme and stuff and linux is just atrocious but because i can't pronounce half of it

537
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:34,640
but at least it's not your mail like yet another mail client yeah no kidding right but i think

538
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,880
that the the intro point of it is that we need to remember that this is not a product that's

539
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,360
going to be successful going straight to consumers it's going to be targeted at some it department

540
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:46,880
at various companies people that aren't going to read into the name other than oh hey this

541
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,360
is doing what i wanted to do they can then rebrand it into something like you know grandma's good

542
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:56,240
time cookie mail or whatever the hell they want to call it and you know what the the name smtp

543
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:00,800
never really seemed to held hold smtp yeah yeah exactly when's the last time you logged into your

544
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:07,440
you know i mean yeah users don't care about that or pop or imap yeah yeah right i i guess where i'm

545
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:15,520
at is i'm left still not knowing what to do like i i feel like i need to probably get off gmail

546
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:20,400
honestly just because like last week when i lost access for a little bit that was enough to freak

547
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,800
me out and then because i now i'm at a point where i have to pay for like every mailbox for a year

548
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:29,200
when i want to create a new mailbox that's annoying because i know you know it's they're not used that

549
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:34,720
much that i need to do that and so i would prefer to just roll my own have my own system but at the

550
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:39,680
same time i don't want to roll something out and then have this come out six months later and be

551
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:43,840
like oh i really wish i would have switched i really wish i had that and then switch all over

552
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:48,400
again right so i'm just kind of in this holding pattern now well i think the main advantage to

553
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,720
rolling your own is that if you control the domain whatever's running in the back that's true that's

554
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,480
true i can just point at something else but this is the time of it you know it is the time yeah

555
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,960
you're right and going back to our previous linux action show if we just get one of those robots i

556
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:05,600
know right now i need it now i need it now you know take care of it yeah you know it'd be awesome

557
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:10,400
with this is somebody would make a susa studio version on this like the own cloud thing right

558
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:16,480
just deploy uh just deploy a darkmail alliance compatible mail server and seriously a few minutes

559
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:23,120
yeah that would be really cool yeah i gotta say as far as branding oh dark cloud with that yeah

560
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:28,560
that's i mean it sounds like underground or it sounds like black market you know you're

561
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:37,120
you might as well call it like hacker cloud or ominous cloud silk mail so are you guys

562
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:43,920
take a charge with that because they offer cloud solutions and that just seems like the best key

563
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,840
are you guys going to contribute to their kickstarter which will have links in the

564
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:58,640
show notes absolutely yeah i mean there's that i mean i i threw in 35 they kind of have a funky

565
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,760
so they i mean honestly this seems like the loosest kickstarter project i've ever seen

566
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,920
because i thought kickstarters were supposed to have like a seriously hard like complete goal and

567
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,280
really the goal here is like well we'll hire some guys and they're going to work on it so it's kind

568
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:16,880
of the loosest kickstarter ending i've ever seen but they've got a 25 spot oh i could have sworn

569
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:22,400
that was a 35 spot when i threw in a 25 spot a hundred dollar spot and then it goes to thousand

570
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:27,360
five thousand ten thousand wow yeah i bet they dropped it to 25 just to make it more accessible

571
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:35,680
um yeah and you know um they're they're now at 27 000 of 196 000 22 days to go they just launched

572
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:41,040
it but when i threw in they were like at 16 000 so they've really it's going up pretty quick

573
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:47,040
yeah it seems loose but because it gets backed by the by uh ladar it makes it okay for me to do it

574
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:52,400
for the 25 at least i agree i feel like i feel like it's totally fine i i think just a reflection

575
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:57,440
on how kickstarter seems to be a little loose if if it's good pr they'll kind of allow a looser

576
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,760
def that's fine i mean it's their it's their prerogative well at the same time if you got

577
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:08,400
that loose of a uh of an ending for it it's not like yeah that just gives them some freedom to

578
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:14,240
work on it how they need to mm-hmm that's true that's true i wouldn't want to box them in too

579
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:19,760
much i want to cover a little bit of two things before we before we run this week uh first of all

580
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:25,680
i'd love to hear your thoughts audience out there on the dark male alliance and replacing email with

581
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:29,280
email 3.0 so email us you can go to jupiter broadcasting.com and click the contact link

582
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,920
and choose linux unplug from the drop down we'll cover your thoughts in our follow-up next week

583
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:40,480
last week uh we asked the audience to vote on uh what they thought which direction debian would go

584
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:45,520
you remember this mm-hmm and uh we didn't get a ton of votes because i screwed up on how i linked

585
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:49,600
and embedded the poll but we still got enough votes i think it's pretty telling we got oh yeah

586
00:50:49,600 --> 00:51:00,960
208 votes total uh 19 of the votes went to upstart 81 of the votes went to system d 81 of the people

587
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:06,800
think it's gonna go system d uh that's probably wishful thinking though i think so right well and

588
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,560
what i want to know is because you have half you probably i'd say you know you have a large group

589
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:14,400
of people that are doing this based on logic you know there's logical reasons why they're throwing

590
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,960
their hat to system d no question that but there's also a fair handful of people that i

591
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,880
firmly believe are throwing it in based on emotion and same thing with upstart i think people throw

592
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,280
into upstart for emotion too i'd be interested in a poll that shows whether you're basing this on

593
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:31,440
you know your emotional dislike for one of them or the fact that you really feel one is superior

594
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:36,640
i would love to see that yeah here's the here's the options to vote and now give it why yeah right

595
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,400
exactly yeah i would i wanted to keep it simple to see what people which way people go people are

596
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:45,760
voting people are voting right now and it's still going to system d and that's totally expected i

597
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:50,400
mean i i don't know that direction overall it uh it's gonna be interesting to see the drama fall

598
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,920
out and then uh either way right either way you think we're gonna get we're gonna get some

599
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:59,760
interesting drama so kind of crazy and and the numbers increase yeah yeah they're going up the

600
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:05,120
system d is still going oh upstart just got a vote well there you go it's it's fast and crazy

601
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:10,560
oh my gosh well uh all right so um maybe we'll do another poll again in the future yeah so next week

602
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:16,080
on the linux action show so on sunday uh we'll be talking if everything works out with joss

603
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:20,960
from open sussa and he is the community manager over there and he's going to be at the fedora sus

604
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:28,320
fedora at the florida suscon right is that what it's called suscon suscon suscon yeah and uh i

605
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:31,600
was i was just kind of thinking maybe we'd brainstorm real quick here with the mumble room

606
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:36,720
on what we should ask the open sussa community manager when he's on the show so mumble room is

607
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:42,240
there any burning questions that we think we should kick the open sussa community manager's way don't

608
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:48,480
forget 13.1 is coming out soon so that's in there and of course uh i've got a list of questions but

609
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:53,200
i i wanted to open the floor and also to the audience um listening on the download just go

610
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,960
over to jupyter broadcasting click that contact link you have a chance to send in choose the

611
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,240
linux action show though and send in your questions for the or start a thread in the

612
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:04,640
subreddit linuxactionshow.rat.com send in your questions for joss i i have a question but it's

613
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:11,920
not very it's not like a broad it's more specific but it seems to be that open sussa is the only

614
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:20,000
distro that you netbootin doesn't work with that is pretty broad okay i don't know if the community

615
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,920
guys yeah i thought there's a couple other ones to do i thought uh manjaro doesn't work with it

616
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:30,560
either if i'm not mistaken yeah right he doesn't i i'd be curious about uh open susa's plans for

617
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:35,120
maybe implementing wayland in the next couple years that's interesting yeah yep yep okay that's

618
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:39,440
a good one he might have the scuttlebutt on that maybe we can what do you have to because um uh

619
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,760
katie e wouldn't they oh yeah they're gonna have to yeah they're gonna have to right keep in mind

620
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:49,680
also this is gonna be an evergreen release oh yeah true yeah so maybe they're gonna be a little more

621
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:54,800
conservative but that's usually that's a good point so maybe this is probably anything we ask

622
00:53:54,800 --> 00:54:00,080
us would be then considered or pondering into future releases going down maybe a year or two

623
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:06,000
rotten did you see that uh big c just linked in the chat room a open susa live usb stick creator

624
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:12,800
that might help you that might help you get going dd uh ben ben digs in the chat room asked maybe i

625
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:19,440
should ask about my sound issues and kde there we go oh wow well they are tied in so tightly with

626
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:23,120
katie it would be interesting and i did experience those same sound issues with an open susa you know

627
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:28,240
with an open system so this is i was saying on the pre-show i was going to uh it's been so long

628
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,920
since i've tried it on another distro but uh just a little background because i know a lot of people

629
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:36,000
don't watch the linux action show live right before last starts and we're trying to stay on

630
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,240
a schedule because we had uh frank from the own cloud project coming on and we didn't want to make

631
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:44,640
them wait so yeah right and and and the runs linux pick was that now robot and it had a video so i

632
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,920
knew i wanted to i knew the first thing out of the gate as soon as we got into the show i want to

633
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,680
play a video and i want to make sure that works because i hate you know to have it like right

634
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:57,600
there in the show the beginning to have some sort of problem so uh i just do a little test run i set

635
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:01,920
my sound outputs i get all the sound effects i even like people i even did like the little bark

636
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,760
sound through the sound effects control panel and the viewers at home were like oh you're making my

637
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:10,240
dog go crazy right we know it's working it goes out over the live stream everything's solid we

638
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:16,800
tested it we saw it on the vu meter i i launch up chromium i load up the tab i click play on the

639
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:21,920
video and the sound comes out my laptop speakers and where it gets weird is that everybody's

640
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,680
immediately going to go oh well you just you just run the pulse audio uh volume manager normally

641
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:29,760
that would be true but in chris's particular case different tabs did different outputs yeah

642
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:35,040
no that's where it got weird that was so strange that's where it's like okay you lost me it's got

643
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:40,080
to be a flash issue it's got to be a flash issue but it's like at the same time uh how do you

644
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:43,520
explain that i i just don't yeah i don't know i don't and then what can i fix it because i had to

645
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:49,600
play the video um and then like later on in that episode you know 30 minutes later we did a skype

646
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:54,320
call with frank and it was just fine there was no sound problems at all right so that's what i

647
00:55:54,320 --> 00:56:01,200
felt about support for kernel 312 with 312 they're going to have full optimist support even

648
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:06,640
switching graphics cards right yeah that is a big thing for laptop users also like what about the

649
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:11,440
installer because i want if they're ever going to update their installer because that thing is still

650
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:20,000
beautiful you mean i've had issues with it like the partitioning part really i i haven't i never

651
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,120
have i've had issues what file systems are you guys using for when you're having problems

652
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:32,960
okay here's something i'd be interested in asking my laptop is currently running open

653
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:40,320
susa 12 3 i wonder how would an in-place upgrade to 13 one work compared to doing a clean install

654
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:47,120
okay good question that's what i was so i was wondering uh what you guys thought like should

655
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:51,200
i during the review i guess certainly if you all do the 13 one and then maybe after the review

656
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:55,440
maybe i can try going for a week on tumbleweed or something that's what i've been doing for a while

657
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:01,600
yeah yeah my issue with tumbleweed is somebody uh the build service packages don't work with it

658
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,320
yeah oh that could be a pain in the butt that's an excellent point yeah good point yeah there's

659
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:10,720
quite a bit in the build service that don't work with tumbleweed yeah yeah okay there's a there's

660
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:15,600
an option in the obs to make it work with tumbleweed but you have to do extra steps for it

661
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:20,560
make it show so maybe they should just have a check box or uh you know something be nice

662
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:26,000
well guys uh that does bring us to the end of this week's linux unplugged you know uh we have

663
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:31,840
gotten i i have stopped i've stopped reading them on air because we get so many emails from folks

664
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:36,400
talking about their switch to arch and i and i think that's so cool that some people are trying

665
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,400
it out and the only reason i haven't covered it is because i didn't want to make this these shows

666
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,640
like some sort of arch and you know promotion platform but at the same time i think it's so

667
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,680
cool that people are trying it after they saw us try it and a lot of people are having really good

668
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:52,560
success i think it's just fun to step outside the box and see what is happening in other

669
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:58,400
distributions as well and uh so one of the things i want to do in the near nearish term

670
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:04,400
what i mean before january uh i'd like to talk to integrals and mangero developers as well so

671
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:08,640
if we have mangero developers out there listening uh go over to jupiter broadcasting.com and click

672
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:12,880
the contact link and choose linux unplugged from the drop down i'd love to get you guys on mumble

673
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:17,120
and chat with you about what you're working on because i have a feeling we're sending a lot of

674
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:22,000
people your way and i'd like to ask you a few questions about how your system works how it

675
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,440
differentiates itself from arch and where you're going in the long run so that's a that's another

676
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:29,520
invite i want to put out there but thanks to the mumble room for hanging out with us this week and
