1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,720
Maybe before we start the show,

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:04,360
let's talk about something that we can't really include

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,360
in the show, because it's not only extremely visual,

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,800
but it's one of those things you have to just kind of

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,600
poke and explore yourself, radio.garden.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,840
And I could only describe this to you as

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,840
a way the internet may have once looked in a retro future.

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,680
You remember when, in like the late 90s,

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,440
we would visualize the information superhighway

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,840
as like this 3D plane that you would drive down,

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,920
and websites and company sites would be like

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,840
these 3D objects that you would approach and go inside of,

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,120
and that's how we thought the web was gonna be, Wes.

14
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,840
That's a Unix system.

15
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,000
Yes, yes, that's a perfect example in Jurassic Park

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,240
where they're flying through all the 3D objects.

17
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,080
Well, now it's real.

18
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:53,080
Radio.garden is a overlay on top of a Google globe

19
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:58,080
of the Earth, and it's hotspots all over the Earth

20
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,640
of radio stations.

21
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,960
They've mapped online radio streams

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,360
to their physical geolocation, and then represent that

23
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,480
on a globe as points of lights.

24
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,400
And so you can move about the globe,

25
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,840
and it moves a cursor over the area,

26
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,540
and then as soon as the globe stops,

27
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,840
it begins playing the stream from that region of the Earth.

28
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,000
And it's a super cool way to move the planet around

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,040
and get a different feel for different music cultures

30
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,960
all over the globe.

31
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,160
It's so neat.

32
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,200
Yeah, right, instead of just scanning your radio band,

33
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,880
do it visually, and you might actually discover

34
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,000
you oftentimes don't know where a random radio station

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,720
that you can hear it's coming from.

36
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,120
Yeah, I had not ever seen this.

37
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,720
Popa, you've seen this thing before?

38
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,360
No, because I get punched in the face

39
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,680
with a this experience requires WebGL,

40
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,880
please try again on a WebGL supported browser dialogue.

41
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,720
What are you using?

42
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,920
What are you using?

43
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,920
The latest version of Firefox.

44
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,720
Oh, I got a Firefox here in the studio.

45
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,640
Interesting.

46
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm getting a retry for a live version

47
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,480
cloud-free prompt and I try.

48
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,680
Oh, we've DDoSed it.

49
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,800
Well, all right, that'll be an exercise

50
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,000
for after the show then.

51
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 275.

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

53
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,360
that's just trying to stay warm.

54
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,200
My name is Chris.

55
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,200
My name is Wes.

56
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,920
Hello, Wes, it's good to be connected with you.

57
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,280
We have a great show, some super great community news,

58
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,600
a bunch of it, we've kind of defined and distilled

59
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,520
like the best news stories of the week from the community.

60
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,720
We'll have those in there.

61
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,040
And then Christian from Red Hat is joining the show.

62
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,280
He'll discuss seamless Linux upgrades,

63
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,160
replacing Paul's audio, some of the recent desktop projects

64
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,880
that Red Hat's been working on, and the value

65
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,640
that Red Hat gets from those desktop projects.

66
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,920
Why are they doing it?

67
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,120
And then a little Thunderbolt 3 doc follow up.

68
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,760
Really looking forward to chatting about that

69
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,560
with Mr. Wimpy because I'm looking for a new Thunderbolt

70
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,000
doc from Milo Novo.

71
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,920
And then we have the poll to name the automation system

72
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,280
and then we'll wrap it up with a couple of app picks.

73
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,560
It's a solid show, Wes.

74
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,440
Oh, it's huge.

75
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,600
There was a lot going on these past couple of weeks.

76
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,760
So it took a lot of effort to distill this.

77
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,320
I hope everyone appreciates.

78
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,920
You know, to make sure we get it right,

79
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,280
we're going to bring in our backup group.

80
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,280
And that's our virtual log.

81
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,720
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

82
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,520
Peep, peep.

83
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,020
Hello.

84
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:27,520
Hello.

85
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,120
Peek-a-boo.

86
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,160
Hello, Brent and Cubicle Nate and Mac and Mini Mac

87
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,040
and Popey and Sean, the Silent Drifter, and Mr. Wimpy.

88
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,760
It is good to see you gentlemen in the show.

89
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,440
I am remote again.

90
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,660
So it's not really different for any of you,

91
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,560
but it always feels different for me.

92
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,720
But it's probably the same for most of you out there.

93
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,560
But I had quite the experience that I just

94
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,060
wanted to share at the top of the show.

95
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,400
It won't take a lot of time.

96
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,080
I met a Zune guy, Wes.

97
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,040
You remember the Microsoft Zune?

98
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,760
Yeah, of course.

99
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,680
That MP3 player that didn't go anywhere?

100
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,900
I actually owned one.

101
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,720
I got it on a Black Friday sale.

102
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,200
I went down with Brian Lunduke to, I think, a Kmart

103
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,760
or, you know, like one of those type stores,

104
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,800
like a Fred Meyers, a Kmart, a Toys R Us.

105
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,600
I think it was maybe it was a Toys R Us.

106
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,760
And we waited in line.

107
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,680
This was years ago.

108
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,160
Yes, to get a brown Zune, which I wanted, I think,

109
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,260
for a honeymoon flight.

110
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,880
I was going on a flight for my honeymoon,

111
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,300
and I wanted something to watch videos.

112
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,560
And it's interesting, though, seeing the Zune again today,

113
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,480
because it is so huge.

114
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,240
These things were discontinued in October of 2011.

115
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,840
And they all have their own Zune service

116
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,920
with its own Zune software.

117
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,780
They are so thick.

118
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,160
They're like two decks of cards stacked

119
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,720
on top of each other thick.

120
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,560
And I'm looking over at this guy.

121
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,680
And I noticed, you know, he's got sort of a look about him,

122
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,520
like a mid-level management look.

123
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,840
And he sits down, and he busts out the Zune player.

124
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,960
And the first thing that strikes me was how much of that UI

125
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,440
is in use today, where you have a very sort of like what

126
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,880
became sort of a famous Microsoft mobile UI really

127
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,920
started on the Zune.

128
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,920
So that was really fascinating to see that.

129
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,640
But towards the end of the flight,

130
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,040
he starts to bust out his laptop.

131
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,400
And I can't help it.

132
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,720
I'm sitting next to this guy.

133
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,880
He's got a Zune player and this convertible Fujitsu or Sony

134
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,800
Windows PC laptop.

135
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,280
And then the guy, I'm sitting right in the middle,

136
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,360
in coach, in the cheapo seating.

137
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,880
And the guy that's got the Windows seat

138
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:35,880
has got an iPhone XS Max, an iPad Pro, an Apple Watch,

139
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,000
and so I've got a guy with a Zune and a Windows foldable PC

140
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,920
next to me, and then a guy with an iPad Pro and the phone

141
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,800
and all that stuff next to me.

142
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,120
And I'm sitting there watching both of these two,

143
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,760
how they use their technology.

144
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,000
And I don't mean to pick, but the guy with the Windows PC

145
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,960
was too big for the seat on the plane.

146
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,880
And if you picture Kilroy or the home improvement neighbor,

147
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,080
where they're always just like their nose up is over the fence

148
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,680
and they're peeking, this guy had the laptop in his lap

149
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,320
with the screen flat on his lap.

150
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,880
And then his nose peeking over the ass of the laptop,

151
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,400
looking at his screen down into his lap

152
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,860
because he couldn't fit this thing.

153
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,680
And then he keeps getting all of these Windows 10 error

154
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,080
messages and prompts for firmware upgrades

155
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,680
while he's watching the movie.

156
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,080
And then the browser edge crashes on him.

157
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,920
He has to reload it, he has to reauthorize Flash,

158
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,520
and the movie loses his place.

159
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,240
And I mean, I'm trying not to stare,

160
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,920
but just watching him have to interact and like

161
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,320
haphazardly mash the touch screen to do all of this.

162
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,800
It was a real interesting use case.

163
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,800
And as we landed, I lean over to him and I say,

164
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,240
I couldn't help but notice you're using the Zune.

165
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,240
Like, that's pretty retro, man.

166
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,840
Like, what's the story there?

167
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,720
He's like, not only do I use the Zune, but I have two Zunes.

168
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,300
I said, what?

169
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:54,800
You have two?

170
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
Yeah, I carry two Zunes with me.

171
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,440
Because he says, as you know, because I told him

172
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,080
I was a former Zune owner, the power bricks for these things

173
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,960
are huge.

174
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,380
And so instead of packing a power brick, he packs two Zunes.

175
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,720
And he runs one Zune down, and then he

176
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,120
runs the next Zune down.

177
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,160
And he hasn't synced them for like two years.

178
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,880
But he tells me there's still an active community out there

179
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,720
of people that love their Zunes.

180
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,200
And I'm looking at this guy like, you've got to be kidding

181
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:19,700
me.

182
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,540
You're still rocking this thing.

183
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:27,120
And as we are deplaning, he picks up a bag

184
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,360
with Microsoft logos all over it.

185
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,120
And I say, oh, so do you work at Microsoft?

186
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,760
Yeah, oh, yeah, I work at Microsoft.

187
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,280
Ah, OK, everything makes sense now.

188
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,680
Like, my whole world was collapsing.

189
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,240
Like, here's this guy.

190
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,560
He's using this touch convertible PC.

191
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,640
He's got a Zune player.

192
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,720
Like, he must be this big Microsoft fan.

193
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,360
That makes a lot of sense.

194
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,060
My whole world's like, it just doesn't compute, right?

195
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,140
But no, he's an employee.

196
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,860
So that makes a little more sense.

197
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,680
There's also some people out there that just don't.

198
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,400
You and I, a lot of the people who listen to the show probably,

199
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,360
we're upgraders, right?

200
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,160
We want technology.

201
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,640
We like technology.

202
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,320
But there is a subset of the populace

203
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,560
that they find a solution.

204
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,000
They put in work finding it, right?

205
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,400
Like, I spent all this money.

206
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,920
I bought two Zoons.

207
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,600
And they don't want to have to reinvest.

208
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,400
They don't want to learn a new ecosystem.

209
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,440
Yeah, I suppose.

210
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,520
I suppose.

211
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,680
I mean, I understand not upgrading and getting money.

212
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,400
And that was my first impression.

213
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,440
My first impression was kind of one of respect.

214
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,920
Like, man, that guy is getting a lot out of that purchase.

215
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,240
Like, I respect when you can push a piece of technology

216
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,200
that far.

217
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,600
There's something about that I can respect.

218
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,080
But I have a sense it was more of an unwilling to change

219
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,960
kind of thing.

220
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,600
Ah, yes.

221
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,120
Combination of loyalty and just stubbornness.

222
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,640
Yeah.

223
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,000
And so what he did is he just doubled down and bought two.

224
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,040
Instead of replacing the Zoom, he just bought another one.

225
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,040
That's a lot to manage, boy.

226
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,720
OK, then my last travel story is I saw a side of Texas

227
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,800
I've never seen before this morning.

228
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,040
And I've been sold, I'm going to say it right now,

229
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,120
a pack of lies about Texas.

230
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,320
And I am angry, Wes.

231
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,440
I have been told that Texas was warm and temperate,

232
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,800
even in the winters.

233
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,680
It is below freezing out there right now, Wes.

234
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,640
Wait, what?

235
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,880
It's below freezing outside.

236
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,800
And there is a damn wind chill that

237
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,120
makes it feel like it's 10 below freezing out there.

238
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,200
It's an aggressive, mean Texas winter right now.

239
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,040
So you flew hours south of here, leaving the beautiful Pacific

240
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,000
Northwest just to be uncomfortable.

241
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,600
Yeah, and I get the sense that this doesn't happen a lot,

242
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,640
because everyone lost their damn minds this morning on the road.

243
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,280
It was a commuter's battlefield.

244
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,640
I've never seen anything like this before.

245
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,320
It was intense.

246
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,440
So I guess the sort of chain of events

247
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,320
that happened is a few fire hydrants exploded

248
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,240
because of freezing.

249
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,120
Yeah, I mean, imagine they're not super well insulated,

250
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,280
right, when it's normally warm.

251
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,240
Yeah, right.

252
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,480
So a few fire hydrants explode, which then

253
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,840
spews water all over the road in below freezing conditions,

254
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,360
which just started a chain of effects

255
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,200
that really screwed traffic up.

256
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,800
But what really blew it open was all of the train track

257
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,680
crossing bars went down with the red lights,

258
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,440
ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, but there's no train.

259
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,340
All of the intersections in this entire Keller town

260
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:16,400
that I'm in right now, they all had the train tracks come down.

261
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,000
So here's Chris, bopping into work this morning

262
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,680
because he's here to do a live stream

263
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,440
in about a half hour or so.

264
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,280
I mean, I had a little bit of fudge time, but not much,

265
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,980
cutting a little close because I thought I had a 15-minute drive.

266
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,640
And I end up getting rerouted by cops.

267
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,440
I end up circling around for 40 minutes.

268
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,880
Long story short, I eventually found a patch

269
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,520
of train track intersection that had recently been shooed away

270
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,520
by their local cops.

271
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,240
And then they had moved on, so there was no other cars.

272
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,120
And I was able, let's just keep it short

273
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,820
and say I had to go into oncoming traffic,

274
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,000
had to put my rental vehicle into four-wheel drive,

275
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,120
and had to drive over train tracks.

276
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,220
And me and about 30 other Texans had

277
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:59,480
to drive over these tracks through the navigation guide

278
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,240
bars, just all this crazy stuff.

279
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,040
Then through a multiple-lane highway intersection,

280
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,360
it was the most insane thing I'd ever seen.

281
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,440
Texans driving in the wrong lanes, going against traffic,

282
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,400
people doubling up in single lanes,

283
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,640
people like me driving over train tracks.

284
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,480
It was every Texan for themselves.

285
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,160
It was total car warfare this morning.

286
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,080
And that's my drive as I'm coming

287
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,160
in to do the live stream for their big 200 announcements.

288
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,080
I tell you what, nothing wakes you up

289
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,480
like that kind of adrenaline rush.

290
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,280
Wow, we are lucky to have you today.

291
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,240
You could have died on those dangerous Texas roads.

292
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,680
It was a side of Texas I'd never seen, Wes.

293
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,800
It was a side of Texas.

294
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,160
You know, it's a balmy 55 here, so come back soon.

295
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,280
You bastard.

296
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,640
That's my travel update for you.

297
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,960
Man, oh, man.

298
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,920
Let's talk about a side of Sony we've never seen before.

299
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,840
You know, Nintendo has the Super Nintendo

300
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,360
Classic and the NES Classic.

301
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,060
They're these remakes of these old consoles,

302
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,880
and they come preloaded with a whole bunch of essentially ROMs

303
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,280
on them.

304
00:11:59,280 --> 00:11:59,760
Yeah, right.

305
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,800
Turns out these old games are better than anything

306
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,640
we come up with now.

307
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,640
Yeah.

308
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,560
Apparently.

309
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,720
And it looks like following in those footsteps,

310
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,320
Sony's going to be releasing a similar take on the PS1

311
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:11,920
next month.

312
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,840
The PlayStation Classic, you may have heard of this,

313
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,200
it's loaded with 20 of the different ROMs.

314
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,600
But here's something that's different than the Nintendo

315
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,160
versions.

316
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,520
The PlayStation Classic is going to use an open source

317
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,600
emulator on the hardware to run Sony's games.

318
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,680
Yeah, I guess Kotaku got some early hands-on time

319
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,920
with this PlayStation Classic and discovered that it uses

320
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,840
the PCSX ReArmed emulator, which is a modern version

321
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,560
of the open source PCSX emulator that was originally

322
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,440
developed way back in like 2003.

323
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,480
Wow, I can't believe they've resurrected this

324
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,480
and it's still working.

325
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,960
I guess it actually still does a decent job of being accurate

326
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,240
to those old games.

327
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,400
Yeah, and in a way, it's sort of Sony saying,

328
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,880
this emulator is better than what we could build ourselves.

329
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,400
Nintendo went their own route.

330
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,840
But here they're saying, this is probably

331
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,960
the closest we're going to get to really recapturing

332
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,680
that original experience.

333
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,240
Now, that kind of feels like a bit of hypocrisy to me,

334
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,640
because Sony's a bit famous for going

335
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,880
after this type of community, the ROM community

336
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,720
and emulators.

337
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,600
And they've been criticized in the past

338
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,040
as being very aggressive.

339
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,040
And so now that very community that's, in some ways,

340
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,200
been chased by Sony for years is calling them lazy.

341
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,920
Like, you give us so much crap and then you use our software?

342
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,360
You lazy bastards.

343
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,360
There was that whole like running Linux and then not

344
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,320
running Linux anymore.

345
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,080
I mean, there's been a lot of Sony-related scandals.

346
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,560
Yeah.

347
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,400
It's also, I mean, it might just be a good testament

348
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,240
to the quality of open source, because you

349
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,280
would assume in-house, paid engineers, access

350
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,280
to all the proprietary stuff, they

351
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,040
could develop a really good emulator specs

352
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,440
for the chips, all that.

353
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,960
But no, I mean, it turns out that open source

354
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,020
is the way to go.

355
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,640
Yeah, it sort of goes back to what we talked about last week,

356
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,720
open source by default.

357
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,560
Also, didn't know this, but the Super Nintendo emulator,

358
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:04,980
SNEX9X, one of my favorites, still alive and well.

359
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,360
In fact, it's seen some really nice improvements.

360
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,240
On the Linux side, the GTK version is now GTK3 ready.

361
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,480
That means you also get Wayland compatibility

362
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,880
fully implemented.

363
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,680
I know, right?

364
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,600
Yeah, that's for sure.

365
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:26,600
So GTK3 and Wayland support in a Super Nintendo emulator.

366
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,520
I am impressed.

367
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,360
Also, yes, I mean, that's just a great emulator.

368
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,120
Yep, recently got my son into that.

369
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,700
And don't tell him this, because it's going to be a Christmas

370
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,400
present.

371
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,160
But there are some really solid Super Nintendo controller

372
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,600
knockoffs that just show up as USB input devices to Linux.

373
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,440
Oh, really?

374
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,160
Yeah, and they're not very expensive.

375
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,620
So I got him one, and I got me one.

376
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,000
So I could try it and test it.

377
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,360
Of course, of course, that's for the show, yeah.

378
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,800
Right, totally professional.

379
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,880
But yeah, it does work.

380
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,600
And so I can't wait to give him one.

381
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,660
And he'll plug it into his elementary OS laptop, which

382
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,640
I just updated to Juno recently, too.

383
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,280
So he's getting all the goodies in there.

384
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,520
Did that go pretty smoothly?

385
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,880
It went super smooth.

386
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,440
And he really likes the update.

387
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,800
He feels like he got a new computer out of it.

388
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,640
He even feels like it's a little bit faster.

389
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,200
He was running two releases behind.

390
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,440
Hey, that's how it should go.

391
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,040
Yeah, I was like, that's a best case scenario.

392
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,880
It's great.

393
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,680
He's really thrilled.

394
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,160
Now, let's talk about Canonical for a moment.

395
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,240
Mark Shuttleworth had a chat with Frederik

396
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,440
at TechCrunch at the recent OpenStack Summit.

397
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,600
And that's in Berlin, I believe, because we

398
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,080
have a couple of people from Linux Academy there right now

399
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,020
as well that are giving talks and doing project meetups

400
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,920
and just all kinds of really cool stuff.

401
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,100
Really well represented, actually.

402
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,360
There's a lot of experts there.

403
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,720
I didn't even think about going.

404
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,480
I mean, it's in Berlin.

405
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,240
That'd be awesome.

406
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,680
But anyways, Mark's also there.

407
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,440
And he had a chat with Frederik.

408
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,680
And he says, I value my independence.

409
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,800
He told Frederik that during a brief chat

410
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,240
on the outskirts of the OpenStack Summit in Berlin.

411
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,260
The outskirts in Berlin.

412
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,760
In part, that's because he simply

413
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,180
doesn't personally need the money,

414
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:07,040
but also because he'd like to see all the way

415
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,380
through his vision for Canonical and Ubuntu.

416
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,160
Now, of course, it's no secret that Shuttleworth would rather

417
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,560
like to see Canonical get an IPO.

418
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,880
But apparently, it still needs some work

419
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,120
to get the numbers right.

420
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,160
I would also just say that after this whole Red Hat news,

421
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,560
the IPO, the public company, and the Linux backing,

422
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,940
I feel like there's a little bit of questions there, right?

423
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,680
A private company is a little more free to, you know,

424
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,200
make their own risks, be a little less profitable,

425
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,040
or at least sort of choose philosophy over profit?

426
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,160
Less so in the public space.

427
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,520
Yeah, I mean, that's obviously why this is even coming up.

428
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,000
You know, that's why they're asking him about this,

429
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,480
because of the Red Hat sale.

430
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,840
And I saw a story recently that more and more tech companies

431
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,560
are sort of bailing on the idea of IPOing.

432
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,560
They're just kind of, I don't know,

433
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,160
like maybe it's coming to an end.

434
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,440
Like, obviously, it's not coming to an end.

435
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,240
But the hype cycle around it, like everybody rushing

436
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,320
towards the IPO, I think, has faded.

437
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,520
And now people are taking a calculated, really,

438
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,160
a much more practical and realistic approach

439
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,240
to doing an initial public offering.

440
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,800
Right, we had this world of unicorns and other things.

441
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,760
You get a bunch of VC money.

442
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,680
You try to go for the IPO.

443
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,960
You try to build this really big, successful company.

444
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,920
But for niche players, people that

445
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,720
aren't going to be an industrial giant,

446
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,280
maybe that doesn't make sense.

447
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,720
Yeah, yeah, I think that's well said, Wes, yeah.

448
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,040
The Open Invention Network has a bit of news.

449
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,280
This is after Microsoft joined them.

450
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,320
And then we all started talking about that Linux system

451
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:39,920
definition.

452
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,520
It's all about the Linux system definition.

453
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,640
Well, the Open Invention Network,

454
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,120
which is now the largest patent non-aggression community

455
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,520
in history, with more than 2,750 community members,

456
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,560
has announced today that it's increased its patent

457
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:57,880
non-aggression coverage through an update to its definition

458
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,200
of the Linux system.

459
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,120
This expansion is part of the Open Invention Network's

460
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,760
program to regularly revise its Linux system coverage

461
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,880
to keep pace with innovation, as they say.

462
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,640
Right.

463
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,760
Now, this expansion includes 151 new packages,

464
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,160
bringing the total number of, quote unquote,

465
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:19,680
protected packages to 2,873.

466
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,960
As they say, with this update to the Linux system definition,

467
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,160
the OIN continues with its well-established process

468
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,040
of carefully maintaining a balance between stability

469
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,520
and innovative core open source technology.

470
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,320
Oh, of course.

471
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,080
Of course, Wes.

472
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,880
Of course.

473
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,600
And while the majority of the new additions

474
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,520
are widely used and found in most devices,

475
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,960
that update also includes a number

476
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,920
of key open source innovations, such as Kubernetes, Cassandra,

477
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,520
and packages for automotive grade Linux.

478
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,600
That last one, kind of surprising.

479
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,080
Yeah, I mean, it's not bad, right?

480
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,800
And this is directly addressing the major complaint

481
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,600
that a lot of people had about Microsoft joining the OIN was

482
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,440
that, well, it's only covering the stuff in that definition.

483
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,160
Well, I think that the message they're

484
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,160
trying to get across here with this press release

485
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,360
is we reevaluate that definition on an ongoing basis

486
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,800
and are open to expanding it.

487
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,720
That must take quite the process, though,

488
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,760
because you've got to get, I mean,

489
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,440
don't you have to get buy-off from 2,000 members

490
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,560
now that we're going to just all of a sudden

491
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,120
expand this definition?

492
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,600
That's got to be a process now.

493
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,360
I mean, anything surrounding all of these patents, right?

494
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,680
That's going to be a lot of lawyers, a lot of rooms full

495
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,480
of lawyers negotiating, and that just takes time.

496
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,520
It also kind of strikes me that we only

497
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,400
need the open invention network because a lot of the patent

498
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,880
system, especially in the US, it's just broken.

499
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,040
Yeah.

500
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,280
Yeah, and like architects pointed out in the chat room,

501
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,920
it's not a perfect solution.

502
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,540
It still has limitations.

503
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,700
It's kind of a bone, right?

504
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,160
It's a bone thrown to the open source from the big companies.

505
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,160
Like, we have to have this because the lawyers

506
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,640
and the executive suites say we've got to protect our

507
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,840
intellectual property, but we also

508
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,720
rely on all this open source technology.

509
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,400
Yes, and you also want to give some insurance to companies

510
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,920
that are considering building products around open source

511
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,300
that they're not going to get sued,

512
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,240
because that was a major topic for a long, long time,

513
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,400
especially in the bad old days of SCO.

514
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,640
It was a major concern.

515
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,200
I personally had several conversations

516
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,980
where I was trying to pitch companies on Linux

517
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,080
and was shot down because they were

518
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,760
concerned about being sued for using free software.

519
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,680
And it was super hard to hear that every time,

520
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,720
because it felt like they were buying into FUD,

521
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,060
that companies were generating intentionally

522
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,800
to just create doubt.

523
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,240
And it was, I wouldn't label it as heartbreaking,

524
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,440
but it was really hard for me to hear people say that.

525
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,280
Right, you're like, I have this technology.

526
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,920
You can use it for free.

527
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,060
And then the cynicism of lawyers just shuts it down.

528
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,480
Yes, exactly, and it was better.

529
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,200
It was better.

530
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:48,960
You can use it.

531
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,320
It'll make my work cheaper.

532
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,520
It'll be more stable.

533
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,320
It is a better solution I can give you,

534
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,280
and the software is free.

535
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,160
It's a business move.

536
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,600
Yes, yes.

537
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,840
So it was really, it was hard.

538
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,920
And so I do appreciate the need for just setting people's

539
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,040
concerns down, just turning down the notch on the concern.

540
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,160
I do see the need for that.

541
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,080
I've got also kind of a concern about LastPass these days.

542
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,440
I mean, I know we've talked about it before.

543
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,960
And I know the general take is just

544
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,360
try to always use free software.

545
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,360
I wanted to give them a solid period of time

546
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,840
after LogMe and bought them just to kind of see how things went.

547
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,760
And as time has gone on and I just,

548
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,640
I wanted it to go another way, but I've

549
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,280
gotten less and less happy with LastPass.

550
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,160
So it's with kind of a wanting eye

551
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,040
that I've been looking at Bitwarden.

552
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,220
And this week, they may have announced something

553
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,960
that's going to tip me over.

554
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,800
Bitwarden has completed a third party security

555
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,720
audit of their software.

556
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,360
And if you're not familiar with Bitwarden,

557
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,760
it's a 100% open source password manager.

558
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,940
Identity manager is probably the term they would use.

559
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,480
And the nice thing about it is it also

560
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,720
has a public bug bounty program as well.

561
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,200
And they write on their blog they're

562
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,820
pleased to announce that Bitwarden has completed

563
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,520
a thorough security audit and a cryptographic analysis

564
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,600
from the security experts at Cure53.

565
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,120
Actually, it's a good step.

566
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,440
It's not perfect.

567
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,160
There were several issues that were identified by the audit,

568
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,840
some with immediate impact.

569
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,240
But the good news, all of those have

570
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,160
been resolved in a recent Bitwarden update.

571
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,200
Yeah, and it wasn't anything disastrous, really.

572
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,240
I looked at it, the PDF.

573
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,320
There's about five vulnerabilities.

574
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,400
And they range.

575
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,120
One of the vulnerabilities was you

576
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,400
are allowing people to use too simple of passwords

577
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,880
for the master password.

578
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,600
Yeah, fair enough.

579
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,880
I mean, that's not exactly a security vulnerability per se,

580
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,920
but it is something they needed to change.

581
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,000
Other things in there, there was a vulnerability

582
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,520
with one of the browser extensions.

583
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,360
But the core stuff all looked really good.

584
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:52,920
And it's just a big moment for an open source project, right?

585
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,960
Because that takes money, that takes community,

586
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,340
it takes funding and commitment to development.

587
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,320
Yeah, it is a big milestone.

588
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,400
And it takes a lot of work, so that's awesome.

589
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,840
I will probably be talking more about Bitwarden,

590
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,400
I have a sense.

591
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,120
Wes, don't you?

592
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,200
Oh, I think so.

593
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,760
And then one last little bit of just sort of updates here,

594
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,040
and then we just got a couple other community things,

595
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:19,200
is the LVFS project has a nice improvement

596
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,440
coming down the pipe.

597
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,280
They've just added an optional feature

598
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,400
to FW update and LVS that some people may find useful.

599
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,160
The firmware update process can now

600
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,240
tell the user how long in seconds

601
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,440
your update is going to take.

602
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,600
So you'll actually get a bit of feedback on that.

603
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,380
That's pretty cool.

604
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:35,880
Yeah, right.

605
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,380
I mean, this means that users can now

606
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,560
know that a doc update might take five minutes or so,

607
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,280
so they can start the process before they go to lunch.

608
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,000
A UEFI update might require multiple reboots,

609
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,200
could take up to an hour, 45 minutes.

610
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,960
So the user can know, like, don't do this right

611
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,360
before your important meeting.

612
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,280
That is really cool.

613
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,920
And LVFS is one of those projects

614
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,000
that I'm going to talk with Christian about when

615
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,120
he comes on the show.

616
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,920
It's, I think, one of those that has

617
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,000
checked one of those fundamental boxes on Linux.

618
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,440
Now, only users running the very latest versions of FW update

619
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,760
and GNOME software will be seeing the duration countdown.

620
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,000
Older versions, it's unchanged.

621
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,500
Nothing really doesn't work for you.

622
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,480
It's just, you're not going to see it.

623
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,040
And it's just ignored.

624
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,080
Now, and of course, for people that aren't familiar,

625
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,120
LVFS is the Linux Vendor Firmware Service,

626
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,160
which is a great way that you can get firmware updates right

627
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:29,840
on Linux.

628
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,760
Yeah, especially these days when those chips are essentially

629
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,520
running little micro operating systems packed

630
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,320
full of vulnerabilities, it's pretty important

631
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,560
that you update that stuff.

632
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,920
It matters more than it used to.

633
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,440
And so it's really good to see LVFS out there shipping

634
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,440
that stuff.

635
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,640
But Arthur writes into the show, and this is so awesome.

636
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,000
He's looking for help with SuperTuxKart networking.

637
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,600
He says, hi, first of all, I want

638
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,480
to thank you for the suite of great podcasts.

639
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,960
I've previously been a listener to several of them for years

640
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,360
now, and I enjoy them a lot.

641
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,600
I am representing the SuperTuxKart project,

642
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,440
which, as you may know, is a free software

643
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,720
and open source racing game.

644
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,520
So I don't know if he's actually a developer,

645
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,960
but he's representing them and focused on fun rather

646
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,960
than realism, which probably means

647
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,200
it would be a hit with my kids.

648
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,760
We are nearing a new stable release

649
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,240
with the headline feature of bold local and internet

650
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,040
multiplayer availability.

651
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,160
We're looking for people willing to test and compile

652
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,680
the game from the latest sources and help

653
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,000
test gameplay over the internet in particular.

654
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,780
Later on, we'll announce a beta release,

655
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,360
which will provide binaries.

656
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,160
But at the moment, we want testers

657
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,240
to be able to compile for themselves in case

658
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,480
we need to debug the output or we need

659
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,320
them to test a fix later on.

660
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,240
He's got more information linked at blog.supertuxkart.net.

661
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,540
And they say they'd be grateful if the listeners could

662
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,440
help spread the word about this.

663
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,400
You'll see it posted a few other places.

664
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,480
And if you do read this, it'd probably

665
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,080
be easier if you just call everyone by my nickname, Arthur.

666
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,040
OK, very good, Arthur.

667
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:57,880
We will.

668
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,760
He says, I look forward to hearing more on Linux Unplugged.

669
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,000
So I went over and checked out the SuperTuxKart blog

670
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,080
as he talked about there in that email.

671
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,920
And holy crap, Wes, they got a lot going on

672
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,160
with this multiplayer stuff.

673
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,000
This looks good, huh?

674
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,440
Oh, it looks great.

675
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,000
I mean, it has been about a year since the last release.

676
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,360
And I would also like to say, adding network play, especially

677
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,720
non-LAN network play, I mean, it works on the LAN too.

678
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,280
But like, internet play with real latency,

679
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,160
that is a significant undertaking,

680
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,740
especially on top of a code base not necessarily designed

681
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,880
for it.

682
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,000
Yeah.

683
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,680
I mean, Wimpy is really into the racing games.

684
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,480
So this isn't like the type of racing games

685
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,600
that Wimpy's probably into.

686
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,760
But if you like the Mario Kart kind of racing games

687
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,320
that are more like, it's like bowling when you

688
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,000
have the bumpers in the lanes.

689
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,280
Yeah, right.

690
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,120
You don't have to just focus on realism or accuracy.

691
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,200
You just get to go wild.

692
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,760
Yeah, exactly.

693
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,520
You get real drunk, you go on your go-kart course,

694
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,560
and you have a good time.

695
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,640
It's a great party game.

696
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,840
It so is.

697
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,080
Or you play it with your children,

698
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,280
which is where SuperTuxKart fits in my gaming agenda

699
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,080
these days.

700
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:01,800
Absolutely.

701
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,400
That's absolutely what I'll be doing.

702
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,960
Also, what's the game called where Tux slides down

703
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,800
on his belly?

704
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,720
That old game that we've all been playing for years now

705
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,240
that I've just completely blanked on the name

706
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,200
where he's in the snow?

707
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:12,980
Tux Racer.

708
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,480
Yeah, OK.

709
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,640
Is that just Tux Racer?

710
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,960
Kids love that one, too.

711
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,600
I think so.

712
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,100
Yeah.

713
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,800
So SuperTuxKart, pretty awesome.

714
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,600
And we might chat more about that in the bit.

715
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,760
It's interesting they're asking for just people that

716
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,120
are willing to build it themselves.

717
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,200
What do you think of that, Wes?

718
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,880
Mostly, it's early days, and they

719
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,320
want to be able to switch things into debug mode

720
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,040
if you run into a problem so they can get

721
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,360
all the necessary information to go actually investigate

722
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,160
that, things that you would leave out

723
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,640
in a real production build.

724
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,320
It looks like when everything's all said and done,

725
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,360
you'll be able to run your own SuperTuxKart server.

726
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,000
You can host it yourself if you want,

727
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,320
if you just want to have a nice little LAN

728
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,480
or something like that.

729
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,760
And they've got an IRC channel set up.

730
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,720
It's SuperTuxKart on Freenode if you want to get in and chat

731
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,680
with people about it.

732
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,920
I'll also say I checked out over in the AUR,

733
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,080
one of our favorite little user-curated repositories,

734
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,080
and there is a SuperTuxKart-git package already.

735
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,560
And if you go look at the package build,

736
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,680
there's a line to use the network branch, which

737
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,000
currently has all these changes.

738
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,360
Nice.

739
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,840
All right.

740
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,320
So you need the network branch.

741
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,400
OK, that is good to know.

742
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,360
That's so cool that they reached out to us to talk about it.

743
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,600
I love hearing that from them.

744
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,360
And I hope that they do get some people

745
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,880
to help them test it out, because that's such a fun one.

746
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,120
And that's great.

747
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,040
Even if we can't have AAA open source titles right now,

748
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,640
if it's just something you get a lot of fun entertainment out

749
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,920
of, it doesn't really matter.

750
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,520
Well, the other thing, too, is if you're

751
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,760
an up-and-coming person interested in both open source

752
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,400
and game development, while it might not

753
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,600
be the cream of the crop, here's an open source game

754
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,440
you can go look at.

755
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,480
You're curious how to make a networked game.

756
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,160
Soon, you can learn from them.

757
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,200
Absolutely.

758
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,600
So I wanted to chat with Christian from Red Hat here,

759
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,600
because they have a lot of desktop projects

760
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,600
that they're working on.

761
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,960
And I started to notice a theme across all of them.

762
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,600
But nominally, the thing I really

763
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,060
wanted to get them on the show about

764
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:07,520
was they've just completed another PipeWire hack fest.

765
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,960
And now the conversation is just beginning

766
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,760
to change to, how are we going to manage the Pulse Audio

767
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,680
replacement rollout?

768
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,840
That's a big milestone.

769
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,840
And so I thought, let's get Christian on the show.

770
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,680
He just landed back in his hometown a little bit ago.

771
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,000
And I wanted to make sure I got the name right, too.

772
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,020
Christian, welcome back to the Unplugged program.

773
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,000
It's been a while.

774
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,260
And you deserve a proper pronunciation of the last name.

775
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,560
So help me there so I don't sound like a doof.

776
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,760
How do you pronounce the last name?

777
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,640
I pronounce my surname Schaller.

778
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,120
Technically speaking, I'm not sure

779
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,000
if it's correct in the sense that it's a German surname.

780
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,120
And I probably pronounce it in a very Norwegian way.

781
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,000
But that's how I pronounce it.

782
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,800
But you are located in the States?

783
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,320
Yes, I am.

784
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,120
I live in Westford, north of Boston.

785
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,320
And your day job is technically working for Red Hat, correct?

786
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,120
Yes, that's correct.

787
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,880
I'm the senior engineering manager

788
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,120
for the desktop team at Red Hat.

789
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,840
OK, well, then you probably are the perfect guy to talk to.

790
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,840
We've been emailing back and forth for a while.

791
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,280
It's been ages since you've been on the show.

792
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,600
But the thing that has always kind of kept you on my radar

793
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,280
is you're often one of the forward-facing people talking

794
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,400
about pipeline developments.

795
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,320
We just recently had Wim on the show.

796
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:18,120
And you also were with Wim at a hack fest even more recently.

797
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,320
And so I thought, gosh, let's get Christian on,

798
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,200
talk a little more about pipeline,

799
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,080
but then kind of get more in towards your general day job,

800
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,440
the Linux desktop itself, and that position,

801
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,600
and all those things.

802
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,760
So why don't we just start with a quick recap of the Pipewire

803
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,360
hack fest?

804
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,240
How did that go, man?

805
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,200
Yeah, I thought it went really well.

806
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,840
We got a bigger group than I actually expected together.

807
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,040
Cool.

808
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,500
Because my background, of course,

809
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,480
was that Wim had been working on Pipewire for quite a while.

810
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,360
And he felt it was time now to see

811
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,160
if he could try to help pull in more people

812
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,320
and sort of get a larger group working on it.

813
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,240
Because the more people helping out,

814
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,200
the sooner we can actually have it in production.

815
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,160
Sure.

816
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,120
So yeah, it was really good.

817
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,720
We had more or less the whole core Pulse Audio team

818
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,320
attending.

819
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,480
And we had people from the also community.

820
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,400
And we had multiple people representing various embedded

821
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,440
use cases.

822
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,280
So was that conversation being had about replacing Pulse Audio

823
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,980
exactly kind of how that might look?

824
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,640
Is that going over?

825
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,000
Is that too awkward?

826
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,120
What about that?

827
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,200
Yeah, no, the conversation went really well.

828
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,240
I mean, the thing is we had been talking to them long time

829
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:25,740
before.

830
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,160
I mean, Wim is actually our contributor

831
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,120
to Pulse Audio at times.

832
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,480
He knew the people well.

833
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,960
It wasn't like he was like this person from outside

834
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,520
who's suddenly jumping in saying, hey, I have this new thing.

835
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,560
OK.

836
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:40,000
So when I started to put together the hack fest,

837
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,760
I actually reached out to Arun Raghavan,

838
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,480
who's one of the maintainers of Pulse Audio,

839
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,160
and said, hey, do you want to help co-host this thing?

840
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,000
Because he and I had been talking about eventually

841
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,220
wanting to move towards Pulse, sorry, PipeWire anyway.

842
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,200
So he was more than happy to do that.

843
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,640
And then we got the group together

844
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,200
and, of course, started discussing, well,

845
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,080
first where PipeWire is today and where

846
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,720
it needs to go to be ready to be that drop-in replacement

847
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,400
for both Pulse Audio and Jack.

848
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,920
That seems like a major milestone when that happens.

849
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,520
And in a way, it's sort of, to me,

850
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,120
it seems like the PipeWire model is more of a Jack model

851
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,400
than it is a Pulse Audio model.

852
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,620
So when we replace Pulse Audio one day,

853
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,120
people are going to see something

854
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,000
that might be more familiar to them as Jack than Pulse Audio.

855
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
That's kind of a transition in itself, too.

856
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,600
Yeah, Olle, I think for, like, if you're an end user

857
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,760
and all you use the songs are for is basically, like,

858
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,600
playing back music or getting audio from a browser,

859
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,080
I don't think you actually would even notice the differences.

860
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,680
I mean, of course, the interesting thing

861
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,240
is that this combination of things

862
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,600
makes some interesting combinations.

863
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,200
I mean, Tanu Kaskinen, who's another commentator of Pulse

864
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,720
Audio, actually brought a post on Patreon recently

865
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,480
where he talked about the hack fest.

866
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,320
And the one thing he mentioned he thought was interesting

867
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,000
was the fact that, you know, Jack has his tools

868
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,200
where you can see all the different applications

869
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,320
that Jack application is running

870
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,480
and, you know, how they're linked together and so on.

871
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,320
It's really cool.

872
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,600
Yeah, and the fact that with PipeWire now,

873
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,480
you can certainly get Pulse Audio applications

874
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,160
into that same graph.

875
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,440
Oh, okay.

876
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,520
That's personally exciting to me.

877
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,400
Yeah, and so we were basically, you know,

878
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,600
running unaltered Jack applications

879
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,720
and seeing, you know, Totem or Rhythmbox

880
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,240
or whatever appear in that graph

881
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,240
so that you can basically connect

882
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,400
your Pulse Audio applications directly

883
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,520
to your Jack applications.

884
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,800
I mean, I'm sure there's sort of practical concerns

885
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,840
where you might not necessarily want to do that

886
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,440
just because they are not written to, you know,

887
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,240
work in the kind of way a Jack application is meant to work,

888
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,480
but in theory, you could, you know,

889
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,200
connect these things together now.

890
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,360
Hmm.

891
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:42,960
This is sort of one of those bigger under the covers projects

892
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,440
that is in the works or has been in the work

893
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,240
semi-recently at Red Hat

894
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,040
that is kind of what I want to talk to you about today

895
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,680
because, okay, so you have PipeWire,

896
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:55,080
which I think is just a fantastic initiative

897
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,600
that Linux really needs for professional audio production.

898
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,160
So I'm very excited about it,

899
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,120
but there's been other kind of like lower level improvements

900
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,880
that are just kind of important and needed.

901
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,760
Like the one that comes to my mind almost immediately

902
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,760
that I don't think people think about very often is Bolt,

903
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,720
which is crucial for Thunderbolt security settings

904
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,160
and having a way for the user

905
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,560
to interact with that on the desktop.

906
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,320
So why don't we take a second here

907
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,600
in the context of PipeWire and some of the other initiatives

908
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,320
that Red Hat's doing,

909
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,120
how do we talk about the desktop in a whole

910
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,320
as something that's just as relevant

911
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,880
or almost as relevant as all of the other major desktops?

912
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,520
I'm not talking about millions and millions and millions

913
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,440
and millions of users.

914
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,160
I'm not talking about it being the year of the Linux desktop.

915
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,440
I'm simply saying how much work is it

916
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,640
to get it to be a relevant desktop?

917
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,400
One that's at the discussion table

918
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,240
with all of the other desktops.

919
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,680
What are your thoughts there?

920
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,680
Yeah, so I mean, I think the way I've been thinking

921
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,840
about it for a long time now is that,

922
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,880
you know, we don't need to be at 50 or 80 or 90%

923
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,320
to be, call it a player here.

924
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,800
I think if you can get the Linux desktop up to let's say 5%

925
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,640
or the total marketer,

926
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,640
which I guess similar to where Mac is today,

927
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,880
I think that's enough to make us relevant

928
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,440
and make sure we stay relevant.

929
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,800
And I mean, that's not necessarily too far away

930
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,640
from where we are today.

931
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,560
I mean, I think, you know, depending on the statistics

932
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,960
you look at, the Linux desktop often ends up maybe around 2%.

933
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,680
So if you're able to climb another 2%,

934
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,280
I think that sort of brings the number where it should be.

935
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,120
Right.

936
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,520
Or where it needs to be.

937
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,560
That actually seems achievable to me.

938
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,800
Yeah, yeah, to me too.

939
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,080
So actually when I came in about six years ago,

940
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,520
and took over the SOP, we sort of sat down and said,

941
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,920
hey, let's have a serious discussion about,

942
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,760
A, where are we putting our resources today?

943
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,240
And are we addressing the things that needs to be addressed

944
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,920
to actually get users in?

945
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,680
And in some sense, we thought, said like, you know,

946
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,520
to achieve growth,

947
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,720
you basically need to have two things happen, right?

948
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,160
A, you need to have new people come in

949
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,720
and you need to have existing users not leave.

950
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,160
So we said like, let's try to look at these two.

951
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,800
And we said like, okay, in terms of leaving,

952
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,200
we've ended up doing some surveys

953
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,680
and trying to figure out like,

954
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,560
why were people leaving their Linux desktop behind?

955
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,360
And I think what we found was the number one reason

956
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,880
at least we could see it for people

957
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,640
not wanting to use a Linux desktop anymore

958
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,760
was hardware support.

959
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,720
That, you know, after this maybe started

960
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,120
with Linux during their university years.

961
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,640
And then as the golden time went by,

962
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,840
they got more and more frustrated

963
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,680
with the fact that, you know,

964
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,160
every time they got a new laptop,

965
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,440
it was, you know, half a year or more

966
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,240
where things maybe were a little bit hazy

967
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,600
whether how well things worked

968
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,280
or there was like always these two functions

969
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,280
on the laptop that never worked.

970
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,880
So we felt that, you know,

971
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,000
A, that needed to be addressed.

972
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,120
And then of course there were other things too

973
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,040
in terms of like, you know,

974
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,560
application availability and so on.

975
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,200
But the hardware issue was something that we sort of said,

976
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,880
okay, that's definitely where people feel the pain

977
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,160
and get frustrated with Linux.

978
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,680
So we basically started saying,

979
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,120
okay, how can we reallocate

980
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,440
all the resources we have available

981
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,400
to try to look more on the hardware side

982
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,200
and also try to be a bit more proactive?

983
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,080
Because I think what often has happened also with Linux

984
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,160
is that a new hardware feature comes along

985
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,200
and, you know, eventually we do get support on Linux,

986
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,720
but it's sort of like maybe a year, two after it

987
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,280
become mainstream available in new laptops.

988
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,840
So I think one of the first things we started looking at

989
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,360
where we wanted to be a little bit more

990
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,400
ahead of the curve was that we spent a lot of time

991
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,160
working on the high DPI support

992
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,720
to ensure that, you know,

993
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,760
as we saw that these laptops were already on the way

994
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,000
into the market, that it wouldn't be once again,

995
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,880
the case that, okay, you got your brand new laptop

996
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,280
with a high DPI screen,

997
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,240
but you had to run it in 1080p mode

998
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,360
because Linux didn't support anything else.

999
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,680
Right.

1000
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,120
So we've been sort of trying to, you know,

1001
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,840
build relationships with harder vendors

1002
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,720
and start planning things up front.

1003
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,200
I mean, Bolt, I guess it's another area

1004
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,480
where we're seeing that like, hey, you know,

1005
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,760
there are going to be a lot of peripherals,

1006
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,880
especially docking stations now moving to Thunderbolt.

1007
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,240
As you said, let's put some on it

1008
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,360
and work together with the hard vendors

1009
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,800
to make sure we have an infrastructure there

1010
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,640
to handle these kind of things.

1011
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,560
Or, you know, another one that crosses my mind,

1012
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,920
I mean, it does serve a purpose in the data center,

1013
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,120
but the Linux vendor firmware service,

1014
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,760
which has been huge for those of us on laptops now

1015
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,080
that can get security firmware updates

1016
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,200
via our software update mechanism.

1017
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,720
I mean, to me, that's a massive,

1018
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,240
huge first-class desktop experience

1019
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,880
that that project is bringing to desktop Linux users.

1020
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,200
And it seems like it's kind of checking off

1021
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,600
one of those fundamental boxes,

1022
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,840
like this is a fundamental thing we need to have.

1023
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,560
Yeah, no, I fully agree.

1024
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,040
And it was also like a product that came up,

1025
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,880
I wouldn't call it randomly,

1026
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,240
but one of the people on my team is a guy called Peter Jones,

1027
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,840
who's actually a Red Hat's representative

1028
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,600
on the UFI Standards Forum.

1029
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,120
And he actually just approached me one day saying,

1030
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,880
hey, you know, it'd be really good

1031
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:53,960
if you can do something here to provide UFI firmware updates

1032
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,440
because, A, that's what's coming.

1033
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,320
I mean, people are moving away from the old BIOS model

1034
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,640
and switching to UFI firmware.

1035
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,000
And the thing we hadn't known for years, right,

1036
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,480
was that people, well, first of all,

1037
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,000
it was extra work for our kernel team

1038
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,800
because often they end up doing workarounds

1039
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,400
in the kernel driver to work around for firmware bugs.

1040
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,520
And in some cases, you know,

1041
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,960
people would often have a laptop and say,

1042
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,160
oh, God, Linux is broken, this thing sucks,

1043
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,160
and, you know, my battery life sucks,

1044
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,320
or, you know, my hard drive is slow, whatever.

1045
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,000
And the problem was that they didn't have

1046
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,920
an up-to-date firmware.

1047
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,920
Of course, if they had, they would have gotten a fix,

1048
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,200
you know, years ago that actually improved their situation.

1049
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,760
So, yeah, so we kicked off that LLVFS effort,

1050
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,520
and, I mean, had to give a big call out there to Dell,

1051
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,400
actually, who was one of the first major companies

1052
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,000
who came on board and said, okay, hey,

1053
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,920
we want to work with you and make sure this happens.

1054
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,520
And, of course, today it's, you know,

1055
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,760
we also have Lenovo signed up,

1056
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,000
and, of course, a host of peripheral vendors.

1057
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,520
Yeah, it's so great,

1058
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,920
especially as we get more and more software in these chips

1059
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,800
that are full-fledged machines that are doing a lot

1060
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,240
and have some security issues, potentially.

1061
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:05,200
And so that kind of first-party update service

1062
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,240
is just super important, maybe more than it ever has been.

1063
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,560
And in a way, I think maybe a lot of desktop users

1064
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,120
can't even really wrap their heads around

1065
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,320
because it's all just a black box to us these days.

1066
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,040
Well, you know, Christian, I feel like I'm kind of seeing

1067
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,960
a theme here, so we talk about Bolt,

1068
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,920
and we talk about the firmware service,

1069
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,400
and getting those firmware updates is super critical

1070
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,080
as these devices do more and more,

1071
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,120
and this is, like, another one of those fundamentals,

1072
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,560
but the one that really seems like

1073
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,440
the most practical compromise

1074
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,080
coming out of the Red Hat and Fedora group recently

1075
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,800
is the support for binary drivers, like the NVIDIA driver.

1076
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,720
And this is something that I think

1077
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,480
I've always kind of criticized a little bit.

1078
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,200
They made it for a bad end-user experience.

1079
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,440
You know, you buy a machine, it's got a $400 part in there,

1080
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,320
and you get about $80 of value out of it

1081
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,560
with the free driver.

1082
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,200
And that was always sort of my proposition

1083
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,840
to the Fedora camp, and the response generally was,

1084
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,760
we really want to focus on free software

1085
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,000
and building a free desktop.

1086
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,160
But as time has gone on, there have been,

1087
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,120
I don't know what else to call them,

1088
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:04,840
maybe compromises to make it a little more practical,

1089
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,040
to sort of check another one of those fundamentals.

1090
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,440
I'd love to know the backstory

1091
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,680
around getting those binary drivers into Fedora.

1092
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:14,200
Yeah, no, it came from the same thinking here, right?

1093
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,360
It's like, we know a lot of people,

1094
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,000
of course, are getting laptops or desktops for this matter

1095
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
with NVIDIA chips, and they needed a binary driver,

1096
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,240
and it was always this pain

1097
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,800
because you had a conflict between Mesa

1098
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,400
and the binary driver.

1099
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,160
And of course, the binary driver was available

1100
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,360
only from a third-party site and so on.

1101
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,960
And we sort of said, like,

1102
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,000
hey, we are a major backers on the wall.

1103
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,280
I mean, we are the only company

1104
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,360
who actually are paying people to work full-time on the wall.

1105
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,680
But at the same time, we need to realize that,

1106
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,200
as you said, when people buy expensive hardware,

1107
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,240
they want to be able to get max use of it.

1108
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,400
And at the same time, we should then use this

1109
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,240
as a way to develop an even better relationship

1110
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,200
with NVIDIA to improve our roles on the wall, right?

1111
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,200
Right.

1112
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,440
So we started up having conversations with NVIDIA,

1113
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,120
saying, like, this is what we want to do.

1114
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,440
We want to, if step one, figure out a way

1115
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,760
to avoid this SO file conflict

1116
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,120
between Mesa and the binary driver,

1117
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:10,120
because it makes life hell for packagers.

1118
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,200
And end users, of course, who have to deal with the fact

1119
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,200
that, you know, they might have a package

1120
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,280
depending on Mesa and then that that gets uninstalled

1121
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,160
to deal with the NVIDIA driver and so on.

1122
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,440
So we set off a lot of discussions of projects.

1123
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,720
And of course, we did the whole GLVND project

1124
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,160
that had this vendor neutral dispatch system

1125
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,440
so you can have multiple implementations

1126
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,000
of your GL drivers and talked about, like,

1127
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,040
how can we eventually get to a point

1128
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,960
where you can support discrete graphics better?

1129
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,960
And of course, at the same time, you know,

1130
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,560
figuring out how can we also collaborate better

1131
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,920
on making sure the wall work better.

1132
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,520
So, I mean, all in all, I mean,

1133
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,840
I don't feel we're there yet.

1134
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,480
I mean, this has been an ongoing process,

1135
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,920
but I think we're miles ahead of where we used to be.

1136
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,640
And I believe that, you know, within a year,

1137
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,920
I think you will suddenly feel that, you know,

1138
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,640
these challenges around NVIDIA hardware

1139
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,840
will to some degree be a thing of the past.

1140
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,240
Interesting, I like that prediction.

1141
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:06,960
What I see here is a multi-team effort

1142
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,000
to solve this problem.

1143
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,520
And when you add it all up,

1144
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,640
it's a pretty sizable investment.

1145
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,000
And I'm curious, in your opinion,

1146
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,480
being inside Red Hat now for six years,

1147
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,240
what do you sense the value is to Red Hat

1148
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,720
to invest in these particular areas?

1149
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,920
You know, the desktop for Red Hat

1150
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,200
isn't almost a special product.

1151
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,840
I mean, you know, Red Hat was actually started

1152
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,160
as a desktop Linux company.

1153
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,920
I mean, I think people tend to forget that these days,

1154
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,920
but you know, the original starting of Red Hat

1155
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,600
was being a desktop operating system.

1156
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,760
And to this day, though,

1157
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,080
to see the desktop as a valuable asset,

1158
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,160
not necessarily as a revenue generating one,

1159
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,360
but you know, it's important in terms of like,

1160
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,080
just training people to use Linux.

1161
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:54,000
I mean, a lot of people who today work as sysadmins

1162
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,400
or developers around a lot of companies around the globe,

1163
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,880
I mean, they got their start with Linux

1164
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,720
through running a Linux desktop.

1165
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,560
Absolutely.

1166
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,040
Mm.

1167
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,160
So for us, it's more like, you know,

1168
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,520
the more people have using Linux on a desktop,

1169
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,760
then the more people are available

1170
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,320
for both us and our customers and partners to hire

1171
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,120
who has, you know, experience and knowledge around Linux.

1172
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,520
That is an interesting answer.

1173
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,200
I hadn't considered the education angle.

1174
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,640
That is playing the long game, but it is a smart one.

1175
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,960
I guess my only other question to you would be,

1176
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,840
is there anything else you wanna mention

1177
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,000
or send the audience to something going on?

1178
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,320
Is there any resources you'd like to inform people

1179
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,760
about because you guys are working on a ton of good stuff

1180
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,480
and some of it deserves a lot more attention

1181
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,800
than it's getting.

1182
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,720
Yeah, I mean, one of the projects we're currently doing

1183
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:40,320
that I'm pretty excited about is called Silverblue.

1184
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:43,920
I think you have covered it before on your show,

1185
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,640
which is basically this idea of trying to make

1186
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,600
an image-based operating system out of Linux

1187
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,760
or for the Linux desktop.

1188
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,120
Because I think what we are concerned going back to

1189
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,880
when we looked at, you know, the problems people have,

1190
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,200
right, and that is this recurring problems

1191
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,640
that upgrades are not seamless.

1192
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,040
So of course, I think we've done a lot of work

1193
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,160
over the last five years for Dora

1194
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,280
to make it a lot more seamless.

1195
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,920
And I think it mostly works now,

1196
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,360
but the problem still often happens, right,

1197
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:10,920
is that time goes by and you install that, you know,

1198
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,880
random package that you found on some website

1199
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,640
that, you know, provides application or feature you wanted.

1200
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,440
And that package starts creating problems

1201
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,800
when you try to go to the next version,

1202
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,960
because it, you know, depends on an SO file

1203
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:27,120
that has changed versioning or whatever.

1204
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,920
So we, of course, well, I guess we have two efforts

1205
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,040
trying to address that problem, right?

1206
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,800
One is of course, Flatpak, which is, you know,

1207
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,480
this core effort of trying to make application bundles

1208
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,720
that of course keep most of their dependencies with them,

1209
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,320
just to avoid this problem of migrating.

1210
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,920
And of course, for Reddit,

1211
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,400
Flatpak brings another valuable feature, right?

1212
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,200
Which just means that we can have one package

1213
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,360
that targets both Fedora and RHEL.

1214
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,520
We don't need to like, you know,

1215
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,320
rebuild Firefox, for instance, for each.

1216
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:56,080
Of course, yeah.

1217
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,000
So that's part of the story, but at the same point,

1218
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,120
we felt that, you know, we still want an upgrade set up

1219
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,600
where that's sort of rock solid.

1220
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,960
And that's sort of where Silverblue comes in,

1221
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,960
where we can say that, hey, we have an image of the core

1222
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,880
and all the packages that are part of that core

1223
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,440
are upgraded as a group.

1224
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,640
So we can basically upgrade, you know,

1225
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,160
call it oversight, verify that everything works

1226
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,440
and that there's no scripts or anything that messes up.

1227
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,960
And then just ship that as an altered image

1228
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,880
to place on your computer.

1229
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,760
My goal is that, A, more people want to try Linux

1230
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,760
because it works better.

1231
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:27,480
And at the same point, less people leave

1232
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,760
because they have problems with it.

1233
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,960
That's sort of where we're coming from.

1234
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,280
And I guess to cover another thing

1235
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,800
that I know was sort of a little bit covered

1236
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,480
in some stories recently was that, you know,

1237
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:39,440
it's been announced now that we're not doing KDE in RHEL 8.

1238
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,120
Ah, yes, right.

1239
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:43,200
In fact, I did want to chat with you about that.

1240
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,280
And well, there's a couple of things to make clear.

1241
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,560
One thing is that, yes, we're not supporting running KDE

1242
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,240
as a desktop, but we're still supporting people

1243
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,360
running KDE applications on RHEL.

1244
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,800
So that's an important distinction to make.

1245
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,360
But, I mean, one thing I went back to

1246
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,400
when we started to look at, like,

1247
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,560
why are people leaving Linux?

1248
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,400
And I guess you could say that, you know,

1249
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,440
if there's one area where Linux

1250
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,400
beats every other operating system,

1251
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,120
it's in the number of desktops available for it.

1252
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,240
Yeah, that's for sure.

1253
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,880
Yet, of course, as we see, it doesn't mean

1254
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,200
that we have a sort of, like, you know,

1255
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,480
taken over the market based on that.

1256
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,600
So I think we've sometimes concluded that, you know,

1257
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:23,200
having a choice of desktops isn't really what drives

1258
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,800
adoption or retention, for that matter.

1259
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,600
And it's quite costly to maintain,

1260
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,600
because, for instance, for my team then,

1261
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,440
who maintains all the desktops in Red Hat,

1262
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,160
it's sort of thinking, it's like, well,

1263
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,840
first of all, the most horrible message

1264
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,560
you can give any customer or user, right,

1265
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,280
is like, oh, if you want to do that,

1266
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,760
then you switch to this desktop environment.

1267
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,760
But if you want to do that,

1268
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,680
then you switch to that environment.

1269
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,800
And if you want to do both, then you have a problem.

1270
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,480
So we said, like, no, we need to be able to say,

1271
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,760
this is what you support, and this is when we get requests

1272
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,920
from users for features, where we'll implement those.

1273
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,520
And at the same point, in order for me to be able

1274
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,480
to move quickly on these things and do projects

1275
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:00,640
like Pipewire and Flatpak and Silverbill and all those things,

1276
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,160
I need to be able to do them both,

1277
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,200
as opposed to sort of feel that we have to re-implement

1278
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,520
the feature, you know, two, three, four, five times,

1279
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,920
depending on how many desktop environments

1280
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,280
we are supposed to support.

1281
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,840
That seems like a tight line to walk, though,

1282
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,440
because at the same time, if you want something

1283
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,880
completely universally accepted, of course,

1284
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,800
you'll need the Plasma desktop to be on board

1285
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,240
with Pipewire as well.

1286
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,720
So there's a line to walk there.

1287
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:20,720
There is, definitely.

1288
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,160
And I mean, the thing is, of course, we are still actually,

1289
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:26,480
you know, despite the plan to not ship with the KD desktop

1290
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,400
in Relate, we are still contributing to KD,

1291
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,440
especially, of course, in this area that we care about.

1292
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,600
So Jan Grulish, who's a member of my team,

1293
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:38,440
he attended a tech fest for Pipewire in Edinburgh,

1294
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,120
and he's the one who's been working on making sure

1295
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:43,440
that we have full Pipewire support in KD.

1296
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,640
That's great, that's great.

1297
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,800
I mean, but it really, I mean, to steal a business metaphor,

1298
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,400
which everybody loves, it really feels like it's about

1299
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,800
putting all of your wood behind a single arrow.

1300
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,680
You know, like, it's about focus.

1301
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:55,960
Yeah, it's about focus, and that's it.

1302
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:58,120
So it wasn't like, you know, an anti-anything.

1303
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,280
It was more like, hey, we need to focus our resources,

1304
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:03,240
which are limited, on solving what we know

1305
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,520
we are costing as customers, and as opposed to, you know,

1306
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:10,800
trying to keep a small subset of people happy

1307
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,560
by offering them, like, this choice of desktops,

1308
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:16,320
which, as I said, doesn't seem to be actually

1309
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:19,080
what drives people to adopt an operating system.

1310
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,880
Yeah, yeah, I could see it maybe keeping people around

1311
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,840
every now and then, you know, if some desktop environment

1312
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,080
has just failed you, and instead of switching back

1313
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,680
to Windows, you could switch to Plasma and be happy.

1314
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,360
That could be a potential, but I see what you're saying.

1315
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,080
People aren't coming over to Linux and going,

1316
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,400
oh boy, after I spend a week picking my distribution,

1317
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,520
I get to spend another two weeks

1318
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:37,800
picking my desktop environment.

1319
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:41,200
Yay, that's not a big advertising point.

1320
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,360
No, and of course, as I said, like, I mean,

1321
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,680
we had cases in the past, right, where people were

1322
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,040
dumping desktops basically to, like, you know,

1323
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,280
hey, multi-monitor is working better here than there,

1324
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,000
but then I discovered that my Wacom tablet

1325
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,120
worked better there than here, and then of course,

1326
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,040
it puts a customer in an impossible situation, right,

1327
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,160
because it's sort of like, well,

1328
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,000
and I have to choose that feature versus that,

1329
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,880
and then we are on the other side sort of struggling with,

1330
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,240
like, well, I don't have enough engineers available

1331
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,560
to fix both this and that, so what we're doing here,

1332
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:10,000
and then people also might think that features

1333
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,440
haven't been fixed because they're, let's say,

1334
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,680
using the wrong desktop environment compared to the one

1335
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,280
where we implemented the fix and this kind of thing,

1336
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:19,000
so it's like, it's a challenging problem to overcome.

1337
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,120
Yeah, well, Christian, I really like the approach

1338
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:22,960
that you're taking here.

1339
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,000
It's sort of, you know, shave away at these rough edges

1340
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,760
and make the desktop just relevant in the marketplace.

1341
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,400
Don't necessarily chase the market share number.

1342
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,120
Just make the Linux desktop relevant,

1343
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,280
and I think we're close,

1344
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,320
and that seems like an actual attainable goal,

1345
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,000
and I think you guys are playing a big part

1346
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,120
of getting us there, so thanks for coming on.

1347
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,160
Thanks for keeping everybody informed on what you do

1348
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,960
and traveling around to participate

1349
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,760
at those hackfests and whatnot.

1350
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,240
I'll have links to the blog and other things.

1351
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,720
Anywhere else you want to shoot people to check out?

1352
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,040
No, I mean, once again, I actually would like to say that,

1353
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,280
you know, of course, yes, we are doing a lot of work there

1354
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,920
and trying to fix it, but I mean, there's other people,

1355
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,520
I think, doing critical work to these days.

1356
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,120
I mean, once again, I would like to actually

1357
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:04,760
give a shout out to Dell for all their recent efforts.

1358
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,720
I mean, I guess we're the first major maker

1359
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,920
who got serious about Linux on the laptops,

1360
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,360
and then, of course, in addition to those,

1361
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,160
we have, you know, smaller but thriving businesses

1362
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,200
like System76 and Purism and so on,

1363
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,920
who are also pushing Linux on laptops forward

1364
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:21,520
and making that a more reliable experience.

1365
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,200
And I mean, another thing that I often felt held us back,

1366
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,840
and we knew we got feedback from people

1367
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,400
saying that they ended up using

1368
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,040
or keeping Linux around for was gaming,

1369
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,160
and of course, Valve has been doing an incredible effort,

1370
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,680
in my opinion, getting Steam going on Linux

1371
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,080
and making sure we have a huge selection of games.

1372
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,200
It really is a full-spectrum community effort.

1373
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,600
Well, Christian, thanks for coming on the show

1374
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,440
and chatting with me.

1375
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:41,520
Yeah, my pleasure.

1376
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,880
I really like talking to him because it's a reminder

1377
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,880
of all of the things that I use every day

1378
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,960
that they're working on,

1379
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,000
and that is more important than ever

1380
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:56,240
in the context of the news with the IBM purchasing Red Hat.

1381
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,320
And, you know, that was sort of what I was getting at, too,

1382
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:01,600
with what's the value to Red Hat for these projects.

1383
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:05,920
And so I enjoyed that entire conversation with Christian.

1384
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,000
You can find links to his blog and other things

1385
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,680
in our show notes at linuxunplug.com slash 275,

1386
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:15,680
including his most recent post about the PipeWire Hackfest,

1387
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,640
which I know Wes and I are super excited about PipeWire.

1388
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:19,480
Oh, boy.

1389
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:20,440
Yeah.

1390
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,040
Well, Wes, we should keep moving right along

1391
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:27,440
because on the Christmas list for me this year

1392
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,560
is a Thunderbolt 3 dock.

1393
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,600
I think I'm gonna do it.

1394
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,800
Ideally, I'd like to do one

1395
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,800
that even maybe has a GPU or something.

1396
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,720
Like, I've got all of these embedded right in there,

1397
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,320
just stock ready.

1398
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,160
Yeah, ready to go.

1399
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,040
Thunderbolt aspirations big time over here,

1400
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,480
but I don't know exactly what to expect,

1401
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,880
where the Linux compatibility is at.

1402
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:51,560
So what I'd like to do is let Wimpy take all of the arrows

1403
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,120
on some of these hardware purchases

1404
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,200
and then check in with him.

1405
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,800
We'll learn from his mistakes.

1406
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,920
Exactly.

1407
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,520
Or successes, or successes.

1408
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,120
Yeah, I know Mr. Wimpress has recently become

1409
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:08,120
a proud owner of a ThinkPad P1, a beautiful new rig.

1410
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:11,120
And I believe he has tied that with a Thunderbolt dock.

1411
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,360
And I'd just love to get your take

1412
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:13,800
on how this is going, Wimpy.

1413
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,600
Yes, so I have.

1414
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:19,680
And I've been using the dock for about a week now.

1415
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:24,320
So I've got a ThinkPad Thunderbolt 3 dock

1416
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,280
and it's the second gen unit.

1417
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:31,280
All right, so you went with a Lenovo branded dock.

1418
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,080
I did, and I will explain why.

1419
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:37,800
So technically there is a single umbilical cord

1420
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:41,280
that connects the laptop to the dock.

1421
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:45,680
But what Lenovo have done is made a connector

1422
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:49,760
on the laptop side, which is a single connector,

1423
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:54,400
but actually bridges the power port

1424
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,280
and the first Thunderbolt port.

1425
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:01,280
And then that connects to the Thunderbolt port

1426
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,720
and connects the same way on the back.

1427
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:07,000
So it connects into a power port and a Thunderbolt port.

1428
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,840
So technically two cables,

1429
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,960
but one umbilical cable to connect the thing together.

1430
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,160
Okay, all right, that's nice.

1431
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,000
And is that delivering a higher wattage?

1432
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,280
Yeah, right, because you can only deliver

1433
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,600
a hundred watts over Thunderbolt 3.

1434
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:25,320
So insufficient for a laptop with a Xeon processor

1435
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:28,320
and a discrete graphics card.

1436
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,880
So that's why you have to sort of provide power

1437
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,400
and Thunderbolt.

1438
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,560
Okay, and so this allows you to what, hook up Ethernet,

1439
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,800
USB devices, like what's the port layout on this thing?

1440
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,200
And what's the capabilities that it brings you?

1441
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,200
Because these things are, over here at least,

1442
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:47,680
nearly $400 US, is it worth it?

1443
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,800
Well, it depends what you're going for, in my opinion, yes,

1444
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,720
because it now makes for a very convenient way

1445
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,160
to connect and disconnect the laptop.

1446
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,320
So this laptop is now going to be

1447
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,440
my main workstation and laptop,

1448
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:04,440
and I will just disconnect it from all of this gubbins

1449
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,040
via one cable now to take it out with me

1450
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,680
when I go out and travel and work.

1451
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:10,880
Yes.

1452
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,400
But the first thing you have to do is use Bolt,

1453
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,520
which of course you talked about in your last interview.

1454
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:22,000
So Bolt is the mechanism by which you actually authenticate

1455
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,640
your Thunderbolt device so that it is now trusted.

1456
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,840
So you run that to connect that,

1457
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,960
and there's command line utilities,

1458
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:34,040
and if you're using GNOME, then that's all built into the UI.

1459
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,080
Hmm.

1460
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,280
And then once you've done that,

1461
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:39,560
on the back of this Thunderbolt dock,

1462
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:44,280
there are two full-size DisplayPort connectors.

1463
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:47,280
There are two HDMI connectors.

1464
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:52,880
There's a plethora of USB 3.0 A ports,

1465
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,840
and there is Gigabit Ethernet,

1466
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:58,240
and on the front,

1467
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:01,040
it's got USB-C and headphone,

1468
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:04,080
and it's an audio interface.

1469
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,600
And is that everything?

1470
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,280
I think that's most of the things.

1471
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,000
And Linux is pretty cool with all that stuff

1472
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,240
just appearing and disappearing.

1473
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,440
It's not really a big deal.

1474
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,640
Yeah. So I've just been, I mean,

1475
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:17,120
I think back to my days when I had a Commodore 64,

1476
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,360
and you used to have to sort of turn the computer off

1477
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:21,360
when you wrenched the cartridge out,

1478
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,440
and that sort of baked into my DNA.

1479
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,320
So I think, can I really just, you know,

1480
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:30,080
yank this out and it'll all carry on working?

1481
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:31,720
And it turns out it does.

1482
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,880
So yes, I just pull it out,

1483
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,560
and the screen has a little bit of a dance

1484
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,640
as everything sort of collapses down to one screen

1485
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,440
on the laptop lid again.

1486
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,840
But yes, it all works fine.

1487
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,880
The one area where I've had to do

1488
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:49,720
a little bit of sort of hackery

1489
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:54,720
is I've got two external 1440p monitors,

1490
00:56:55,600 --> 00:57:00,600
and the internal panel on this laptop is UHD.

1491
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:05,440
So you run into this mixed DPI environment

1492
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:09,760
where one of the DPI's is going to be dominant.

1493
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:14,840
And what I've done there is I've written a little script

1494
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,920
that manipulates XRender.

1495
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:21,840
So it enumerates what monitors are attached.

1496
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:24,080
It lays out the monitors in the right order.

1497
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,160
So effectively, I've got the monitors in front of me,

1498
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:31,040
left and right, and then the laptop sits right

1499
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,960
in the middle between the two of them.

1500
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:36,280
And this XRender layout actually positions

1501
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:39,840
the laptop monitor in the center of the crease

1502
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:43,560
where the two monitors line up and uses the correct offset.

1503
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:46,320
So as you drag down, as you move down,

1504
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:49,920
you're directly moving into where you'd expect the mouse

1505
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,840
to appear on the laptop lid beneath you.

1506
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:56,800
And then I use some scaling in XRender

1507
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:01,280
to basically make that internal panel,

1508
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:05,800
the effective resolution, approximate to 1080p.

1509
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:10,800
So that now means that I've got effectively the same DPI

1510
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:13,120
across all three of those machines.

1511
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:16,080
Now, there isn't a UI that enables you

1512
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:19,320
to facilitate that in X at the moment,

1513
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:24,360
but using XRender, it is possible to create that.

1514
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:25,680
So yeah, I have this little script

1515
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,280
that just checks periodically,

1516
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:31,000
sees which panels are detected,

1517
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,040
and adjusts itself accordingly.

1518
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:35,160
I know it's sort of a small script,

1519
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,520
but have you thought about tossing it up

1520
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:37,880
on your GitHub or something?

1521
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,720
Because that's something I might use.

1522
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,880
Yeah, well, I was discussing this with Popey earlier,

1523
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:45,160
and the first thing he said is, I want it at the moment.

1524
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:48,680
It's very much sort of hardwired to my screens

1525
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:52,120
because it's my display IDs, it's my resolutions,

1526
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:55,600
the offset calculations are all hardwired,

1527
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:59,160
but I think I'll put it up as a gist

1528
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,520
and just sort of document what it's doing,

1529
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,600
and then other people can try and take advantage of that

1530
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,520
and figure out how to reuse it.

1531
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,400
But ultimately, what we need to do

1532
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:13,400
is make the display arrangement UIs

1533
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:16,040
in the desktop environments be smart enough

1534
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:21,040
to be able to accommodate these more exotic display layouts.

1535
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:22,600
Absolutely, especially as this becomes

1536
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,120
more and more possible, there's gonna be lots of laptops

1537
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,800
with Thunderbolt 3 ports.

1538
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,560
So if I recall correctly from a couple episodes ago,

1539
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:32,280
you got the Thunderbolt 3 workstation dock,

1540
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:37,280
which Lenovo sells for $356 here in the States.

1541
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,760
Now, this is where I'm torn, because you're right,

1542
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:40,880
it's a beautiful dock.

1543
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:44,720
It's got two HDMI, two DisplayPort, Ethernet,

1544
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,200
and it's got that bigger connector,

1545
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,000
which delivers more power.

1546
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:53,000
But Lenovo also sells a Thunderbolt 3 dock for $362

1547
00:59:55,400 --> 01:00:00,400
that has a few less ports, but has a GTX 1050 built into it.

1548
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:05,680
So I would go from Intel graphics to getting a 1050

1549
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,560
when I plug in that Thunderbolt dock.

1550
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:10,920
Now, I grant you, a 1050 is not gonna rock my world,

1551
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:13,560
but it's better probably than the Intel embedded.

1552
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:14,920
And that's really tempting.

1553
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:17,400
Do you think that would possibly even work?

1554
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,520
Yes, I know it will work,

1555
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:21,920
because when I have this dock attached,

1556
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:26,920
I have a single additional Thunderbolt port spare,

1557
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:30,320
and I've been able to connect my Razer Core to that

1558
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:34,880
and use the 1080 Ti in that to amplify things.

1559
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:37,120
Now, as it happens, this laptop also has

1560
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:39,480
Quadro P2000 discrete graphics in it,

1561
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:43,000
which is more or less equivalent to a 1050.

1562
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,760
And the 1050 isn't to be sneezed at.

1563
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:47,320
I was just using it to play Horizon Chase Turbo

1564
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:48,800
before we came on air this evening.

1565
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:51,000
It's not the most demanding game in the world,

1566
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,960
but it was flying along at plenty of frames a second

1567
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:55,440
and was very enjoyable.

1568
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:56,520
That's what I was thinking.

1569
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,160
Like, I could play a game,

1570
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,480
and all I have to do is plug in my dock.

1571
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:03,840
So, and it still has a couple of DisplayPorts.

1572
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:07,080
I think it has two DisplayPorts on it, but only one HDMI.

1573
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,080
Right, right.

1574
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,360
Yeah, I mean, I'm only ever gonna use two monitors.

1575
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:12,680
I don't have space for any more monitors than that here,

1576
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:14,800
and the ones I've got are plenty big enough.

1577
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,600
I might give it a go and report back

1578
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,520
on how that GPU integration works with Linux, too,

1579
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:20,040
just after some testing.

1580
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:22,000
Yeah, and I can explain, you know,

1581
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,520
the way that that actually works is,

1582
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,960
I've written an applet for Marte to make this easy,

1583
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:31,400
but the way you use it is you just run the Nvidia settings,

1584
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:35,120
and there's even a switch to take you to the right portion

1585
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:37,440
of the settings where you can just flip-flop

1586
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,960
between Nvidia and Intel.

1587
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,480
Ah, good to know.

1588
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:41,440
Thank you, sir.

1589
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:45,160
Well, I always like learning vicariously, as they say.

1590
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,760
It's the least expensive way to learn.

1591
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:50,400
It really is, and maybe we can pass it along.

1592
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,840
But, you know, I've got dozens of USB devices connected here.

1593
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:57,560
You know, webcams, the mic, the USB audio device,

1594
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:59,280
multiple keyboards, mice.

1595
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:04,280
A bunch of other stuff, controllers, all sorts of things.

1596
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:07,360
And now, I just have one cable to connect,

1597
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:11,280
and the monitors and all of those devices just power up.

1598
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,240
That is the dream.

1599
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,880
One cord, and it's powered, data, everything.

1600
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,240
It's stuff, and it's no longer just on the USB bus.

1601
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:18,560
It's on the PCI bus now,

1602
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:20,600
so we're talking, like, real hardware, too.

1603
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,520
It's on the PCI bus, yeah, yeah.

1604
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:24,960
So, yeah, this is not too shonky.

1605
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:29,800
So, there's four PCI lanes available to that hub,

1606
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:33,640
to that dock, rather, to deliver all of those pieces.

1607
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:36,000
Obviously, the more displays and things

1608
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,480
and the more bandwidth you're using,

1609
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:39,640
but it runs really nicely.

1610
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:41,280
I've had no problems with it at all.

1611
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:44,560
Hmm. I'll put links to both the one that Wimpy got

1612
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:47,400
and the one that I'm going to grab and try out in the show notes,

1613
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,880
if you guys want to check that out, linuxunplugged.com,

1614
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:51,840
slash 275.

1615
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:54,520
How's that P1 treating you? Is it going good so far?

1616
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,520
Yes.

1617
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,800
Well, that doesn't sound like a super yes, though.

1618
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:01,800
Well, you know, I'm an early adopter,

1619
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,000
so you can always expect problems, can't you?

1620
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,760
So, there are two issues.

1621
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:09,920
These issues will be the same for ThinkPad P1 owners

1622
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:13,640
and ThinkPad X1 Extreme owners.

1623
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:17,920
The first one's minor, and that's that the...

1624
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:21,520
what do you call it? Fingerprint sensor scanner thing

1625
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,720
is not currently supported.

1626
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,040
Oh, of course.

1627
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:27,040
So, that's a minor issue.

1628
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:30,520
The other one that's a bit more interesting is

1629
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:35,320
hybrid graphics don't work on this at the moment,

1630
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:39,000
and I spent the weekend having a poke around

1631
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,200
with the GPU manager,

1632
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:45,920
and I've got a hacked up monkey patched thing here

1633
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,200
where I've kind of got it half working.

1634
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:51,200
So, where I say half working,

1635
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,920
it means that I don't have black screens

1636
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:54,920
and I can't do anything.

1637
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:57,320
I actually get the displays to initialize,

1638
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:00,320
but I'm not at the moment able to switch between

1639
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,320
hybrid and discrete graphics.

1640
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:04,320
But I'm a bit further forward in that,

1641
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:05,520
you know, when I first tried to use it,

1642
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:06,920
I just had black screens,

1643
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:09,520
and now I have screens that function.

1644
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:13,520
Well, yeah, that is a bit further forward.

1645
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:14,520
You're right. Okay.

1646
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:15,520
Yeah.

1647
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:16,520
Well, that's good.

1648
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:18,520
Well, I wish you luck there on your journey, sir.

1649
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:19,520
I would love to know how it goes.

1650
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,520
Yeah, it wouldn't be fun if it didn't have a few problems.

1651
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,520
You don't feel like you own a computer

1652
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,520
until you've solved some of these little gremlins.

1653
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:26,520
You know, I've been there,

1654
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:29,520
where there's times where I buy sort of the ambitious system,

1655
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,520
and then there's times where I buy the really practical system

1656
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,520
that I know is going to be taken out of the box and get to work,

1657
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:36,520
and it just sort of depends on what you want to get out of that system,

1658
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:38,520
and the ones where you eventually get them working

1659
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:40,520
are sort of rewarding in themselves

1660
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,520
because it's like an accomplishment.

1661
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:46,520
Now, we have just a couple of bits of business to take care of

1662
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:48,520
before we get out of here for this week.

1663
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:50,520
We won't spend a lot of time on it this week,

1664
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:56,520
but the official voting is now opening for our automation system.

1665
01:04:56,520 --> 01:05:00,520
You can find the link in our show notes.

1666
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:01,520
Go give your vote.

1667
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,520
We'll deal more into that next week,

1668
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,520
but if you want to get the early vote in,

1669
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,520
you can find the link to our new system.

1670
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,520
But I just wanted to take a second

1671
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:13,520
and talk about a really cool tool that Wes found this week

1672
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:16,520
that he's actually already managed to put into work,

1673
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:19,520
and I think it was from an email from a listener, Brandon,

1674
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:20,520
that tipped you off.

1675
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:22,520
Yes, that is right.

1676
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:26,520
Brandon wrote in to us and was asking if we'd ever heard of the Junest project.

1677
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:28,520
I don't know if I'm saying that right,

1678
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:32,520
but J-U-N-E-S, or Jailed Under Nest.

1679
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:36,520
It essentially lets you run Arch Linux with fake root access.

1680
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,520
It really uses PRoot,

1681
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:42,520
but that basically means you get a whole little user space Arch install.

1682
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:43,520
You don't need root.

1683
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,520
All you need is a home dir,

1684
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:48,520
a little bit of modifications to your path, and git.

1685
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:51,520
But you probably already have all of those things,

1686
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:54,520
and now you have all of the Arch packages, the A-U-R,

1687
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:56,520
and that wonderful package manager, Pac-Man.

1688
01:05:56,520 --> 01:06:00,520
Right there on top of any distribution you want to use.

1689
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:04,520
Is that what you used to try out the SuperTuxCart build?

1690
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:05,520
Yes, it is.

1691
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,520
I mean, because it was already in the A-U-R, right?

1692
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:09,520
That's one of the nice things about Arch,

1693
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:13,520
even in the days of Snap packages and Flatpak and all that.

1694
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,520
Arch just has a lot of packages.

1695
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:18,520
And if you're like me, I mean, I just spent so many years on Arch.

1696
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:21,520
Even though a lot of my systems are Ubuntu these days,

1697
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:22,520
I'm familiar with it.

1698
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:25,520
It's easy, and a lot of times you kind of just get that minimal baseline.

1699
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:28,520
You don't have to worry about a whole bunch of different extras you need to do.

1700
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:29,520
It's all right there.

1701
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,520
It's up to date.

1702
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:31,520
You get the latest.

1703
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:34,520
And now with Junist, you can have it all in a throwaway environment.

1704
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:35,520
That's pretty neat.

1705
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:36,520
That's pretty neat.

1706
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:38,520
Thank you to Brandon for tipping us off to that,

1707
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:41,520
and thanks, Wes, for kicking the tires and giving that a go

1708
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:42,520
while I'm out and about.

1709
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:44,520
Junist, Arch on Linux without root.

1710
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:46,520
We'll have a link in the show notes for that as well.

1711
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:49,520
Go get more poppy and wimpy.

1712
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:54,520
Mark as well at the Ubuntu podcast, ubuntupodcast.org.

1713
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:56,520
A special shout out to producer Michael

1714
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:59,520
for helping us out with our mumble room disaster

1715
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,520
we had right before the show.

1716
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:05,520
Go get his great This Week in Linux on YouTube,

1717
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,520
and go get more Wes Payne.

1718
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:10,520
He's over there at techsnap.systems

1719
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:12,520
for another podcast that he's on with us,

1720
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:16,520
and he's over on the Twitters at Wes Payne with a Y.

1721
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:17,520
Oh, that's right.

1722
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:18,520
Payne with a Y.

1723
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:19,520
Yeah.

1724
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:22,520
I'm at Chris LAS, the network's at Jupiter Signal.

1725
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:26,520
Thanks so much for joining us, and we'll see you back here next Tuesday.

1726
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:58,520
You know what?

1727
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:01,520
So producer Michael in the chat room says,

1728
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:05,520
Chris LAS, could you not have given the option of cast-a-blast-a?

1729
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:08,520
I had that same thought when I looked at that list.

1730
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:11,520
I thought we should just maybe call it cast-a-blast-a

1731
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,520
because that was the first podcast we ever did.

1732
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:14,520
It's too perfect.

1733
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:16,520
Yeah, it does seem like it'd be really perfect,

1734
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:19,520
but then I thought we're creating name collision

1735
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:22,520
with like a piece of our history maybe,

1736
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,520
or it's an homage.

1737
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:25,520
I don't know.

1738
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:53,520
So I just sort of dropped it.

1739
01:08:53,520 --> 01:09:22,520
So I just sort of dropped it.

1740
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:51,520
What are you linking me?
