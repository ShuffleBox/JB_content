1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,780
Hey, you know what we ought to do in the pre-show?

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:03,900
Is document right here for eternity

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,240
the fact that Wimpy broke our Mumble server this week.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,380
So we're using Jitsi.

5
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,300
You're welcome.

6
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,660
Do I even want to know what you were doing?

7
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,940
Do I even want to know?

8
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,340
I just pasted the bomb emoji into the comment

9
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,460
and hit save and it blew up the Mumble server.

10
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:16,700
It was beautiful.

11
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:17,540
Ah.

12
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,440
Hello friends and welcome back

13
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,360
to your weekly Linux talk show.

14
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,260
My name is Chris.

15
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,320
My name is Wes.

16
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,500
And my name is Brent.

17
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,320
Hello gentlemen, anchor down

18
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,520
because it's a windy day in the Pacific Northwest

19
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,000
and I don't want either one of you to blow away

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,880
because we've got a lot going on in this episode.

21
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,320
But first, I must say it's brought to you by a Cloud Guru,

22
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,280
the leader in learning for the cloud,

23
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,320
Linux and other modern tech skills.

24
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,420
Hundreds of courses and thousands of hands-on labs.

25
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,400
Get certified, get hired, get learning at acloudguru.com.

26
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,840
So coming up on the show today,

27
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,840
it's our episode where we defend the command line.

28
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,160
In this particular week that we are recording,

29
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,280
the command line is coming under attack

30
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,380
and we're going to hunker down and defend it.

31
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,840
In fact, I may even attempt to argue

32
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,580
that the command line could be new user-friendly.

33
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,220
And I think everyone who is discouraging learning

34
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,820
or using the command line

35
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,880
is actually burying their head in the sand

36
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,280
and they're doing a disservice to Linux adoption long-term.

37
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,300
I think we should be teaching people the command line,

38
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,600
not avoiding it.

39
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,260
That's key to future Linux user success.

40
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,180
So we'll talk about that

41
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,160
and why I feel that way so strongly.

42
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,280
And then we'll round out the show with some great emails,

43
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,520
some pics and more.

44
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,860
So before we go any further,

45
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,120
I'm going to bring in our virtual lug.

46
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,720
Hello, Jitsi Room.

47
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,120
Hello, hello, hello.

48
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,120
It's got its pros and cons compared to Mumble.

49
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,280
You know, I think Jitsi is a pretty cool tool.

50
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,320
And I like seeing some of you, that's very nice,

51
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,680
but it doesn't quite have the same smoothness

52
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,120
handling audio from everyone like Mumble does.

53
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,600
Yeah, WebRTC just can't compete.

54
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,160
Yeah, Mumble is really kind of good at that.

55
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,600
And plus we can have structured rooms

56
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,920
with permissions and stuff.

57
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,800
And you know, it's not so with Jitsi, at least not yet.

58
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,600
Yeah, and so far Wimpy hasn't figured out

59
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,000
how to break Jitsi, at least I don't think.

60
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,200
Oh no, I have, I'm just not going to do it.

61
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,600
I don't want to torpedo the show twice in one evening.

62
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,040
I appreciate that.

63
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,500
So before we jump into the community news

64
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,480
and whatnot today, Wes,

65
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,940
I think it's time for maybe the very last time

66
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,280
we do an ARCH update.

67
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,000
Ah, dang it, I thought you'd forgotten.

68
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,520
I think this is it, because a lot of things are in motion.

69
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,260
We have parts in route.

70
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,600
We have more things happening this weekend.

71
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,120
And I thought maybe for one last time

72
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,920
we should officially check in.

73
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,680
Cause you never know, this could be the one that breaks.

74
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,560
This could be it.

75
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,760
I mean, it could be.

76
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,680
Yeah, and I'm going to miss these when they're gone.

77
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,720
I know, it's been fun.

78
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,880
So tell me, tell me what we're looking at.

79
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,800
Cause it's been a minute.

80
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,800
Woo wee, 127 packages, 652 megs download,

81
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,720
only 63 megs net upgrade,

82
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,140
but there's some good packages to upgrade in here.

83
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,800
ButterFS, Cockpit, Containerd,

84
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,000
we weren't using that, Docker, Docker Compose.

85
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,280
Yes, we're getting a new Linux LTS kernel,

86
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,440
update to Snapper, SystemD,

87
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,000
and of course a new ZFS DKMS module.

88
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,400
Oh boy.

89
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,020
And that's not even to mention the fact

90
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,080
that there's a new SSH server,

91
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,080
new Samba, this is a huge update.

92
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,040
So I guess, I guess hit the go button,

93
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,640
let's start the downloads

94
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,960
and we'll come back and see, see what happens.

95
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,240
Wish me luck everyone.

96
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,560
All right, and then while you do that,

97
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,300
I have the pleasure to announce something very special

98
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,240
coming soon.

99
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:49,040
It's the 2021 Tuxes.

100
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,320
All right, so the nominations are open.

101
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,420
You can go vote for the best free software projects,

102
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,480
Linux distros, text editors,

103
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,120
the big impactor of the year,

104
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,720
server distros and a lot more.

105
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,380
What really stood out in 2021?

106
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,960
Head over right now to tuxes.party.

107
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,400
We've only got a little bit of time,

108
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,400
tuxes.party or I'll have a link in the show notes of course.

109
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,520
It's not too many questions.

110
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,960
I tried to refine it,

111
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,880
thanks to some help from the virtual lug

112
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,960
before we started the show.

113
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,840
We kind of whittled the list down a little bit

114
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,280
and I think it's gonna be pretty quick to answer.

115
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,560
Not everything's on there.

116
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,980
Cause if you think about it,

117
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,200
we could rabbit hole this thing

118
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,540
like a million different ways.

119
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,480
So we tried to just kind of keep it concise

120
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,920
and do something that we could build year on year data.

121
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,840
So maybe after a few years of doing the Tuxes,

122
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,560
we'll have some trends and interesting things

123
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,400
that come out of it.

124
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,800
So go to tuxes.party and go vote.

125
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,100
We are trying it out with next cloud forums too.

126
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,480
So West stood up a new next cloud server for this

127
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,460
and cause we honestly didn't wanna make

128
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,000
our precious next cloud servers,

129
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,480
which we have two of available to all of you.

130
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,160
Well, now we have three.

131
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,240
Now we have three.

132
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,320
So go over there and vote and let us know what you think.

133
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,680
And then towards the end of the year,

134
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,400
just pretty much like maybe one of our last few episodes

135
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,480
of the year,

136
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,800
we'll announce the winners

137
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,280
and the winners of last year

138
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,480
received not only our accolades,

139
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,180
but some of them that I could track down

140
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,080
also received a little Tuxy trophy.

141
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,260
I think this year we'll do something else

142
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,320
pretty special for them too.

143
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,640
So go try it out.

144
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,120
And I guess this is our big test

145
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,340
to see how next cloud does for forums.

146
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,680
It's gonna output all the data as a CSV file, right?

147
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,280
So gonna have to massage that a little bit.

148
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,960
Yeah, I mean, I totally tested it with one entry in there

149
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,800
in that network.

150
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,460
So it should scale to the size of the audience, right?

151
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,200
I wanna mention our friends at a Cloud Guru

152
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,720
have a Linux web services course

153
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,280
that might be right up your alley.

154
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,160
Learn about the various software tools

155
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,360
and utilities to configure web services on Linux.

156
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,640
And yeah, that means the differences

157
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,040
between NGINX and Apache,

158
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,200
setting up squid and reverse proxy,

159
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,560
figuring out how to do HTTPS and SSL and load balancing,

160
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,380
getting metrics out of Apache,

161
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,600
all of that stuff is in a Cloud Guru's course.

162
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,840
So I have a link in the show notes

163
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,640
or go over to a cloudguru.com

164
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,760
and search for Linux web services.

165
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,600
Again, that's a cloudguru.com

166
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,540
and the course is Linux web services.

167
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,000
We'll have a link in the show notes.

168
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,400
But one of the big stories over the weekend

169
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,820
is that System76 is reportedly developing

170
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:26,760
their own rust written desktop, not based on GNOME.

171
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:31,480
It all really stems from a couple of comments

172
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,520
from a System76 engineer on Reddit.

173
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,680
I mean, this whole story just blew up

174
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,760
from just a few comments about some challenges

175
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,440
with what they're experiencing

176
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,440
with I think maintaining cosmic.

177
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,940
And I didn't really know how legit this story was,

178
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,440
because when you read through some of the articles,

179
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,380
you can see some frustration with the engineer.

180
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,360
Like one of the things that he wrote in the Reddit comments

181
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,680
is what are you expecting us to do?

182
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,880
We have a desktop environment

183
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,480
that has a collection of GNOME Shell extensions,

184
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,920
which break every GNOME Shell release.

185
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,480
Either we move towards maintaining tens of thousands

186
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:12,480
of lines of monkey patches, or we do it the right way.

187
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,440
We make the next step of fully fledged desktop environment

188
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,900
equal to GNOME Shell.

189
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,240
And that just took off like wildfire.

190
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,120
And so I emailed Carl, the CEO of System76,

191
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,940
and I said, you know, is there smoke to this?

192
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,000
Is there fire to the smoke, I guess is the saying?

193
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,040
You know, how legit is this?

194
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,520
What are you guys, where are you at?

195
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,360
Where's your heads at?

196
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,380
What's going on here?

197
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,880
And of course I asked, why not Plasma?

198
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,560
Oh, good man, yeah.

199
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,560
I mean, right?

200
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,560
I mean, isn't everybody thinking how amazing would it be

201
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,600
if a well resourced vendor came along

202
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,880
and got their hands on Plasma

203
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,700
and really gave a go at doing a deployment of Plasma?

204
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,000
And we all wanna see what would happen.

205
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,760
But that is not this day, my friends.

206
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,260
Carl writes, we are designing and writing codes

207
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,680
towards a cosmic desktop environment.

208
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,760
Both are experimental and intended only to test

209
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,680
the tech stack that we will eventually land on.

210
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,260
I think it's likely this will result

211
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,760
in a new desktop environment,

212
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,300
but we have other questions to answer

213
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,160
before that's official.

214
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,280
The investment we're making in POP is large regardless.

215
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,660
We're putting similar resources into the 2023 version of POP

216
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,260
that we put into the factory.

217
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,080
The desktop environment is only one part of the story.

218
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,240
There's more to come.

219
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,080
And then in regards to when I asked about Plasma,

220
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,080
he says, Qt is C++, and it doesn't have rust bindings.

221
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,840
We considered Kaywin and had the same problem.

222
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,400
Our team's expertise is in rust.

223
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,120
Most of all, we're spending more time adapting upstream

224
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,240
than adding value for our customers.

225
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,880
Building and maintaining the desktop environment

226
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,800
will be considerable, but at least it will work

227
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,520
towards our vision for the future

228
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,720
of a desktop operating system.

229
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,760
So what I've took away from this email from Carl,

230
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,600
and I'm curious if this is what you take away, Wes,

231
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,200
is this is a direction they're heading,

232
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,320
but it's in the R&D phase right now.

233
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,120
Yeah, I mean, we haven't seen a whole bunch of fanfare

234
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,200
as you pointed out.

235
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,200
I'm definitely maybe a bit skeptical on one hand,

236
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,000
just because I think that's the default

237
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
whenever you hear about a new desktop environment

238
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,840
coming out, I think.

239
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,160
But I have enjoyed watching what they've been trying

240
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,440
with Cosmic, and yeah, I mean, it seems like

241
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,680
the way they've done it so far,

242
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,480
there were just gonna be some limitations,

243
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,880
and if they're really hitting up against those,

244
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,440
you gotta do something else.

245
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,360
I kinda wanna go around the horn on this one.

246
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,560
I'm looking right now, because I have video with Jitsi,

247
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,480
and I'm seeing Neil's eyebrows go up,

248
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,400
and of course, I've got questions for Wimpy,

249
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,480
so I'll start with you, Neil,

250
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,040
and then we'll go around the horn from there.

251
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,400
What was your initial reaction?

252
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,400
Because I think it's pretty easy

253
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,680
to have a knee-jerk reaction of,

254
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,520
well, we have too many desktop environments,

255
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,280
why do we need another one?

256
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,280
But it seems to me that System76

257
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,440
could be in a unique position

258
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,640
where they do have a very tight feedback loop

259
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,120
with their customer base.

260
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,880
They sell a physical product that is gonna come loaded

261
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,800
with whatever they end up creating,

262
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,400
and if things don't work, they're gonna hear about it

263
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,960
from those customers who are working through support,

264
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,720
and in a way, they have kind of a tighter feedback loop

265
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,600
than just about any free desktop environment has right now.

266
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,280
Does that give them a special position

267
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,400
to create something here?

268
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,680
Absolutely, it certainly does.

269
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,320
Fundamentally, free software is all about creating projects

270
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,720
that solve your own problems,

271
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,240
and their problems weren't getting solved

272
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,720
with the way Cosmic was being done now,

273
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,160
with the extensions layered on top of GNOME Shell,

274
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,240
and I totally get where they're going with this.

275
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,960
From the perspective of what Carl Richel was saying

276
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,560
about them creating their own desktop

277
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,240
gives them better control to focus on their vision,

278
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,960
I can totally see that viewpoint.

279
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,680
It makes a ton of sense.

280
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,640
However, it is already difficult

281
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,760
to get people to do stuff on desktop Linux as a whole,

282
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:53,760
and the more splintering in actually advancement

283
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,200
of desktop technologies to support various users,

284
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,080
the more difficult it is for the Linux platform

285
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,440
as a whole to succeed.

286
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,320
Like, already today, for example,

287
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,280
accessibility and internationalization

288
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:11,640
are really, really not in great shape

289
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,880
in all the desktops except for GNOME.

290
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,080
That's because 20 years ago, Sun Microsystems

291
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,520
put a buttload of effort

292
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,360
into making that happen with GNOME 2.0,

293
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,920
and GNOME has reaped the benefits of that

294
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,600
in the 20 years after.

295
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,840
And with KDE Plasma, for example,

296
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,280
because you asked that of Carl,

297
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,280
I think the real reason that KDE Plasma

298
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,120
doesn't really go further

299
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,480
is because there isn't somebody

300
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,560
doing that tight feedback loop

301
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,240
and has the correct incentives

302
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,200
to stick at it and drive it forward.

303
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,560
But I also think that the reason why they're doing this

304
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,440
is because their experience with GNOME

305
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,720
was painful enough to turn them away

306
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,960
from doing this again.

307
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,600
And so I understand what they're feeling

308
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,960
from that perspective.

309
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,280
With that in mind, where I kind of almost feel

310
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,560
like there's some echoes of falling out

311
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,680
that we saw with Canonical

312
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,240
when they decided to launch Unity.

313
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,520
And so, Wimpy, is there a parallel there that you see?

314
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,960
And then the second question I have for you

315
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,840
on top of whatever else thoughts you might have

316
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,320
is when you look at System76's products

317
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,200
as an option in a marketplace,

318
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,480
isn't it a pretty big risk to hit the reset button

319
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,120
on a desktop environment right now

320
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,840
when there's some really serious competition out there?

321
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,400
So the first thing I'd say is there's a quote,

322
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,560
I forget who said it,

323
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,000
and it's people that care about software

324
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,120
should make their own hardware.

325
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,880
And it seems to me that System76

326
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,640
are kind of coming at this the other way

327
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,760
and coming to the same landing place,

328
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,560
which is they care about their hardware.

329
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,320
So now they're caring about the software

330
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,040
that they ship on their hardware.

331
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,800
And I think that that's a good place to be.

332
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,600
Like you say, they know their customers,

333
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,000
they know what their customers are looking for,

334
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
they know what they want to give to their customers.

335
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,360
And if they're not finding that with the available options,

336
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,960
then as Neil says, yes, the whole point is

337
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,000
that they've got this massive tool set

338
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,200
of amazing software that they can use

339
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,280
to put something together.

340
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,520
Now, there's gonna be some significant effort

341
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,160
to actually create something of their own, but why not?

342
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,880
Well, we shouldn't resist people's desire

343
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,600
to be creative and make something new.

344
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,280
This conversation is the first time I've heard about this.

345
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,760
I didn't see any of the discussion on Reddit,

346
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,400
but yes, on the face of it, it does sound similar,

347
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,640
that when Canonical had a vision

348
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,360
for what they wanted to deliver to their users

349
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,640
on the desktop and that deviated from Gnome's vision,

350
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,280
then Canonical ended up going their own way.

351
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,720
And that's fine too.

352
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,560
You don't always have to use something existing.

353
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,640
It's a big undertaking though.

354
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,680
Just maintaining a desktop environment

355
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,600
is a significant effort.

356
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,080
Actually creating something new

357
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,960
and then building it, that's a ton of work.

358
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,720
Any significant software project

359
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,600
you should look at as a 10-year endeavor.

360
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,920
So if they're gonna go this way,

361
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,240
it will be an interesting journey

362
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,080
and one that I will enjoy following.

363
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,320
I don't think they will be alone in doing something

364
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,160
like this.

365
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,240
We've already seen Josh Strobel put out

366
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,400
sort of not a manifesto as such,

367
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,760
but he wrote up that he was stuck

368
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,760
between a rock and a hard place.

369
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,840
And I know from my time at my past employer

370
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,080
that things are in the works.

371
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,920
Right.

372
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,760
That's all very insightful, Wimpy.

373
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,720
And I'm struck by this also sort of opens up

374
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,360
the Gnome project to just push forward on their vision

375
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,800
and collaborate with people who are on board

376
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,400
and people who are not on board

377
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,680
can focus on their own vision.

378
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,960
It actually seems like long-term,

379
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,360
it's gonna be better for a lot of projects.

380
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,960
But Brent, there was something Carl said in that email

381
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,160
that jumped out at me.

382
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,760
And I wonder how you interpret.

383
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,680
He said, we're going to invest in this.

384
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,360
I think he said in 2023, like we invested in the factory.

385
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,720
And you've been there, you've seen what that factory,

386
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,320
what that means is staffing, it means equipment.

387
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,200
I mean, it means a lot of things,

388
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,400
but where do you think that could go?

389
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,840
Like, what's your interpretation?

390
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,440
Well, I think what we all saw

391
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,160
when we got our really, really fascinating tour

392
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,040
of their factory recently is that

393
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,640
when they jump into something, they jump full steam ahead

394
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,600
and they try to get some of the best talent to work on that.

395
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,760
And so it's not a 50% effort from them that we see,

396
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,200
it's sort of a hundred percent plus plus, you know?

397
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,280
So what I would really love to see maybe in,

398
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,240
you know, he said 2023,

399
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,640
is if they take that same idea of innovation

400
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,280
that they applied to something like the launch keyboard.

401
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,000
You know, we had some pretty fascinating discussions

402
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,960
about what went into even the starting phases

403
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,880
of implementing those ideas into what is a keyboard

404
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,840
that we sort of assume was optimized already,

405
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,200
but they threw in some innovations

406
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,200
that weren't necessarily obvious,

407
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,080
but now seem really fascinating.

408
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,960
And they even told us they had to scale it back a little bit

409
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,320
to make it a bit more approachable.

410
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,880
So I'm really curious, similar to Wimpy,

411
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,720
to see if they jump full in as they tend to do,

412
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,120
where will that take the desktop?

413
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,840
And will they implement ideas

414
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,120
that are maybe a little bit different

415
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,640
than what we're seeing out there already?

416
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,720
Right, you could say obsessive,

417
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,000
and that would be an understatement.

418
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,200
So Wimpy, I know you have a wrap up thought, go ahead.

419
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,440
As we were saying, they are not alone

420
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,400
in having feelings of sort of disenfranchisement

421
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,120
over the current situation.

422
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,040
I wonder if System76, if they move beyond

423
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,040
what sounds like sort of prototyping and experimentation,

424
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,160
if they move beyond that into actually scoping something,

425
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,400
whether they'd be up for approaching individuals

426
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,600
and teams of people who probably feel the same as them

427
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,960
and trying to sort of bootstrap a project

428
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,160
that they can sort of lead.

429
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,160
Because I feel like there is a community in the making,

430
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,200
behind something else.

431
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,040
That's a really interesting question, yeah.

432
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,960
Can they form a new locus of community around this?

433
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,960
Because that was my other thought when we were talking about

434
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,680
there can be this tight fit with their customer base

435
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,800
and the people they support.

436
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,400
And that just made me wonder,

437
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,360
well, how well does that map onto the general wider community

438
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,560
and do we lose out on some of that?

439
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,080
But if there is something of a new consensus

440
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,880
forming around that, maybe it does have

441
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,760
something broader in its reach.

442
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,200
Well, I know we have more thoughts,

443
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,120
but I wanna move forward.

444
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,280
So save them for the post-show,

445
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,040
because we have one more news story to cover.

446
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:52,040
It's been nine years since the Steam beta rolled out.

447
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,720
Take that in everybody.

448
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:04,680
I still can clearly remember putting together the research

449
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,240
and trying to verify some of the rumors

450
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,080
that Larbel had printed on Foronix

451
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,280
about the beta potentially coming to Linux one day.

452
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,840
I still clearly remember the effort

453
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,040
of trying to reach out to contacts and sort all that out.

454
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,480
I mean, this couldn't be true, right?

455
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,640
How could it be true?

456
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,840
It just seems impossible,

457
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,400
because that must be like 10 years ago now.

458
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,280
That's, it's unbelievable.

459
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,760
And it, in a way, it feels like it's built more momentum

460
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,600
in the last three to four years

461
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,600
than it had for all nine of them.

462
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,480
And we were just on the precipice

463
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,520
of the Steam Deck being released.

464
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,040
And we also just got updated from BattlEye,

465
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,960
the anti-cheat folks,

466
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,000
that it looks like support is in good shape

467
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,600
with the new Proton experimental version.

468
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,600
And it doesn't, I don't know

469
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,360
if it's actually shipped to people yet,

470
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,000
but the takeaway from it is truly that BattlEye,

471
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,440
and what was the other one?

472
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,600
Oh, Easy Anti-Cheat?

473
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,760
Yeah, so both BattlEye and Easy Anti-Cheat

474
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,640
have done their updates.

475
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,200
And you know what, I'm pretty impressed.

476
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,480
And then last but not least,

477
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,760
we don't need to spend a lot of time on this,

478
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,760
but I just think it's totally worth a mention

479
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,160
because of the incredible effort that's been going into

480
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,440
a brand new calendar application.

481
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,000
I know it's not, you know, it's not like,

482
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,520
it's not super, super exciting,

483
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,000
but calendar spelled with a K is out.

484
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,080
And this is really looking great.

485
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,120
I mean, Linux needs a solid native calendar application.

486
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,320
There's some out there for sure,

487
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,120
but something that's really competitive.

488
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,280
And this honestly looks like one of them.

489
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,160
And I mean, you guys listen,

490
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,920
I wouldn't be putting it in the show

491
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,880
unless it actually looked really legit.

492
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,000
And I've been following the development

493
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,840
since the very beginning,

494
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,240
and I've been waiting to give them their plug.

495
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,000
And they just put out, I think it's actually 0.1.

496
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,840
I may have misnoted it, but either way,

497
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,680
they have a release now,

498
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,760
and I want you to go check it out

499
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,600
if you need a calendar on Linux.

500
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,480
Linode.com slash unplugged.

501
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,800
Go there to get $100 and 60 day credit on a new account.

502
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,560
And you go there to support the show.

503
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,560
Linode's how we host everything we've built

504
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,920
since going independent.

505
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,600
And I think it could be a secret weapon.

506
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,200
See, as part of these reads,

507
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,880
I'm telling you how we do stuff.

508
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,000
You get to peek behind the factory,

509
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,240
but you can have Linode as your secret weapon.

510
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,000
You can go out there and have 11 data centers,

511
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,280
have 40 gigabit connections coming into your servers,

512
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,840
have brand new MVME storage rolling out

513
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,840
to your block storage,

514
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,800
have object storage that's S3 compatible

515
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,240
that you can rely on.

516
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,520
I mean, that's actually how I kind of think about Linode now

517
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,640
is I think about it as my infrastructure.

518
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,480
It's how I'm gonna build everything going forward.

519
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,320
I've seen the light.

520
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,320
And the knock-on benefits once we've gone all in

521
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,240
have been just fantastic team-wise.

522
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,640
Everybody knows how to use the Linode dashboard.

523
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,680
We can build automations using their API.

524
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,680
And as we start talking about

525
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,400
approaching the JB infrastructure as if it were code

526
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,240
and using things like Ansible or Terraform

527
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,840
or probably not Kubernetes,

528
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,400
but I know some of you out there would wanna use that.

529
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,400
Well, of course, Linode works with all of that.

530
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,880
So it can also be really part

531
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,040
of a multi-cloud strategy as well.

532
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,400
You get 11 data centers to choose from.

533
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,440
And every single service level is backed

534
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,240
by the absolute best customer service in the business.

535
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,280
And I just underscore that because for me,

536
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,320
I'm running my business on Linode.

537
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,360
I mean, it matters too when it's your personal blog

538
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,000
or a gaming server or something like that.

539
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,280
But man, when it really matters,

540
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,280
it's so great to know they've got your back.

541
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,600
Every step of the way since 2003, Linode's asked themselves,

542
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,520
how do we really use Linux to accomplish this task?

543
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,440
They've really innovated in that area,

544
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,040
starting with the early days of virtualization in Linux

545
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,080
to networking and user interfaces

546
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,280
and so many other things that really have,

547
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,160
we just kinda, we take as obvious now

548
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,520
and Linode was at the very early steps of that stuff

549
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,320
because they're geeks, they're into this stuff.

550
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,920
I can really kinda connect with that.

551
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,200
That and the fact that they're independently owned

552
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,040
and independently funded.

553
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,400
That's huge for me.

554
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,160
So head over to linode.com slash unplugged.

555
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,360
Go get that $100 in 60 day credit

556
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,120
and try this stuff out for yourself.

557
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,920
See what we've been talking about.

558
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,920
See why so many listeners of the show

559
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,000
have been trying it out.

560
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,160
I mean, think about that for a moment.

561
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,360
You think Linode would still be here

562
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,760
if people weren't still trying it out and sticking around?

563
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,800
Thousands of Linux Unplugged customers

564
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,000
have signed up for Linode and are loving it.

565
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,840
Go see what you think and get $100 and support the show.

566
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,960
Linode.com slash unplugged.

567
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,320
Unplugged.

568
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,320
Well, the video we've all been waiting for,

569
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,080
dreading maybe, it's finally here.

570
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,480
The latest on Linus's adventures with Linux.

571
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,000
Yeah, it's titled Linux Hates Me.

572
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,200
So you can probably guess how it went.

573
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,040
It's Linus and Luke over at Linus Tech Tips.

574
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,560
We've been really resisting the urge

575
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,120
to talk too much about this on the show

576
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,040
because, you know, it doesn't,

577
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,320
it's not gonna have much impact

578
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,760
beyond day to day life right now.

579
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,920
But today, as we recorded the day the video dropped.

580
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,640
And there's a theme that's in the video.

581
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,520
And there's actually a theme that Linus and Luke touched on

582
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,280
in their WAN show that I want to expand on here.

583
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,640
You might be asking if you're not familiar with these guys,

584
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,360
why are we talking about this?

585
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,760
Well, they are in the top 10 channels on YouTube.

586
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,920
So they have a very large audience

587
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,720
and they are the number one tech channel on YouTube.

588
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,160
And they are doing potentially up

589
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,480
to a five part Linux challenge

590
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,080
in front of their ginormous YouTube audience.

591
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,120
So it's a pretty big milestone for Linux

592
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,120
in terms of tech coverage and new potential audience.

593
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,880
So there's a theme in there that I thought though,

594
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,160
I'd like to pull out.

595
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,680
Because I think if you watch this first video,

596
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,760
it bit Linus and it caused him

597
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,240
to sort of rush through something

598
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,720
and end up actually wrecking his Pop OS install.

599
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,600
And we've all heard it before.

600
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,480
Once you go command line, you've gone bust.

601
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,920
I have a quick example from a recent WAN show.

602
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,200
So my bottom line on this,

603
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,280
my take and you can hate me for it,

604
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,560
is that the Linux community needs to stop relying

605
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,240
on the command line as a crutch

606
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,560
for creating user experiences that are actually usable.

607
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,400
They can't just say, well, the GUI doesn't need to do this

608
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,640
because it can just be done in the command line.

609
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,840
Because until that attitude changes,

610
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,360
I'm never gonna be able to get

611
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,480
my brother-in-law using Linux.

612
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,200
And I think it's pretty understandable

613
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,200
why people outside Linux would be sort of,

614
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,200
I don't know what's the right word, anti-command line.

615
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,200
They'd be sort of skeptical of using the command line.

616
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,080
There's a whole vocabulary on the command line

617
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:35,920
that you have to know.

618
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,440
You have to know how to even start to invoke things.

619
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,280
There's really no reference point where to start.

620
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,840
Just a scary blank black box, right?

621
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,280
What do I even type into this thing?

622
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,520
Yeah, exactly.

623
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,640
It's not obvious, is it?

624
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,480
Especially if you've never used a command line before.

625
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,600
Yeah, and you compare that to the sort of

626
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,840
default discoverability of a lot of GUIs, right?

627
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,920
Where you sort of just like, well, all right,

628
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,920
there's a file menu or there's a whole bunch of buttons.

629
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,480
Now you still may not know what they do exactly,

630
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,200
but you can at least see that they're there

631
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,600
as an option to use.

632
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,880
And I think also there's an appeal to the idea

633
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,480
that something can be automatically done by a wizard

634
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,480
or you check a box.

635
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,640
And there are benefits obvious to a GUI

636
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,040
when you're looking at the settings.

637
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,160
It's great to see the check boxes

638
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,360
and the dropdown menu with your different choices.

639
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,800
And it gives you an idea of what is capable.

640
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,960
So there's clear advantages to the GUI.

641
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,000
But I think what we should do is try to build a culture

642
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,040
that embraces learning the command line over time.

643
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,680
I think what we need to work out is this.

644
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,440
Once you go command line, you go broke.

645
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,480
Once you're gone command line, you've lost.

646
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,400
Like we have to get this mentality away

647
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,960
because there's a couple of realities

648
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,880
when dealing with Linux.

649
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,440
And that is that GUI interfaces change frequently.

650
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,720
And the command line syntax changes much, much,

651
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,120
much less often.

652
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,280
Some command line syntax doesn't change for like 20, 30 years.

653
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,960
And so when you go look up a guide online

654
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,680
or a how-to article, the command syntax,

655
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,720
even if this article was written in 2008,

656
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,720
is probably still the same.

657
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,760
But if that article is written in 2008, 2015,

658
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:08,040
even 2018, 2019, and it's telling you how to do something

659
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,360
in the GUI and Linux, there's a very good chance

660
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,840
it's out of date or you're using a different GUI

661
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,240
because there's a lot of GUIs.

662
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,040
Yeah, this thing doesn't even mention Flutter.

663
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,280
What am I supposed to do?

664
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,120
Right, and maybe I'm on Plasma,

665
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,440
but the guide was written for GNOME.

666
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,120
The other thing about the command line,

667
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,200
the command line syntax can be spoken.

668
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,160
I can say do ls tac lh.

669
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,960
It's a little bit harder to actually walk you through

670
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,400
how to sort your file manager by date

671
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,760
if somebody's completely new to it.

672
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,360
Additionally, the command line can be copied and pasted.

673
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,440
So if you're doing remote support for somebody,

674
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,760
you're in a Telegram session, a chat session, whatever,

675
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,280
you could send them the command

676
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,000
or they could look up a command.

677
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,920
And the reality is the command line's actually

678
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,280
one of the very best things about Linux.

679
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,160
I mean, the command line is what sold a lot of MacBooks

680
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,680
back in the day when they switched over to Mac OS 10.

681
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,920
Command line is a lot more approachable

682
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,760
when you're doing any kind of remote session.

683
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,480
Command line is a lot more clear.

684
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,120
It can be spoken, it can be read, it can be typed.

685
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,160
It's consistent, right?

686
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,560
There's no like trying to, you've all probably,

687
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,040
I imagine most listeners of this show

688
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,560
have had to try to walk somebody through doing something

689
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,480
in a GUI when you can't see their screen.

690
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,520
And then there's the realities of Linux.

691
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,840
To me, and I mean, this is an area I'd love some input on,

692
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,000
but it doesn't seem like we're ever gonna have

693
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,840
a GUI tool for everything.

694
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,080
It moves fast.

695
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:35,240
Linux and all its tools and abilities come quick.

696
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:39,520
And GUI tools, especially ones that are good, move slow.

697
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,360
So there will always be gaps.

698
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,240
There are always gonna be things that roll out

699
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,080
that only work on the command line.

700
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,880
We'll have a lot of good tools, but we can't have everything.

701
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:52,600
So I feel like we ought to try to change the perception

702
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,360
in some way about command lines.

703
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,840
They are user-friendly.

704
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,320
They are new user-friendly specifically.

705
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,120
We have to make them less scary.

706
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,320
Am I off the mark here?

707
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,560
Everybody give me your thoughts.

708
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,400
Start with you, Brent.

709
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,960
So tell me, what are your thoughts on this?

710
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,160
I have several and they don't necessarily all agree.

711
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:19,920
One of them is my experience a long time ago with Mac OS.

712
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,880
I think many of us would agree

713
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,160
that the Mac user interface is pretty friendly.

714
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,680
And a lot of people who aren't power users

715
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,380
using that pretty successfully.

716
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,600
But the best thing about the Mac for me

717
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:35,600
was the ability to go from using the visual tools

718
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,880
to growing as a computer user

719
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,800
and then being able to access the command line stuff

720
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,940
to play even more and accomplish things

721
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:49,940
that the visual interface had never intended me to be doing.

722
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,000
Now that's one of the reasons I got off Mac OS to Linux.

723
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,400
But I think it's a nice transition

724
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,880
into being more of an adventurous user.

725
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,600
If you're interested in the inner workings

726
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,520
of computers and stuff,

727
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:08,200
I think the explicit nature of how the command line works

728
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,120
is great for understanding the underpinnings

729
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,360
of how your computer works.

730
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,240
I think visually, there's a lot of obfuscation

731
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,800
of how all the stuff that's happening in the background

732
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,300
where the command line sort of exposes that

733
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,160
in a really nice way, at least for my brain,

734
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,360
worked really, really well as a teaching tool

735
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,540
and still does every day.

736
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,280
And I think a point I take away

737
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,440
is even the commercial operating systems,

738
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,080
you end up using the command line from time to time.

739
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,560
It's not like this is only a Linux problem.

740
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,760
If you wanna edit some P list on a Mac

741
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,960
or you wanna do something on Windows

742
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,680
that requires reloading the service,

743
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,460
the quickest way to do it is from the command line.

744
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,600
So Bight, I wanted to give you a chance to jump in.

745
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,320
I have a friend that as soon as you tell him

746
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,560
he needs to open a command line, he goes hyperventilating.

747
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,220
He goes almost into shock by,

748
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,280
oh no, the command line, I don't know what to do.

749
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,760
Well, I think that's actually what happened

750
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,840
to Linus in this video.

751
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,120
He's trying to install something

752
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,520
and he kind of goes into a fugue state

753
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,480
and just rushes through the command line experience

754
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,640
because he just wants it over as fast as possible.

755
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,560
And we've been there, right?

756
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,860
I mean, I've definitely been there.

757
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,240
And it's also that with the command line,

758
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,120
you usually need to know what the syntax is,

759
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:22,420
what your options are, in what order.

760
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,000
And with a graphical user interface,

761
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,560
you get that all handed to you.

762
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,080
You get only your available options.

763
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,760
You have just the options in front of you

764
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,240
at that moment in time.

765
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,040
And the thing is that with the terminal user interfaces,

766
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,720
those have evolved quite a bit

767
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:44,720
because if you're looking at some setups for terminals,

768
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:50,240
those are usually quite graphical for being in a terminal.

769
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,320
But yeah, being open source,

770
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,640
it's also, again, there are many forms of that

771
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,920
and there isn't a baseline in there

772
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,760
except the command line itself.

773
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,320
Standard, yeah.

774
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,280
I wonder too, Wes, like, could that be an area

775
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,360
where some distros could kind of push forward a little bit?

776
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,320
Is take some of this stuff

777
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,700
that makes the command line a little slicker,

778
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,280
that auto figures out what you're trying to do a little bit.

779
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,600
Is that part of maybe the solution?

780
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,980
Yeah, I don't think any of this is to say

781
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,640
that we shouldn't have intuitive GUI systems.

782
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,480
And at the same time,

783
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,460
that we can't improve the command line user experience,

784
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,300
right?

785
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,520
Like, there's a lot that can be done better.

786
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,680
You know, like we were just using an NC do in the studio

787
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,520
the other day, Chris,

788
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,800
and that's a thing that happens in a terminal,

789
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,680
but it's a lot less scary than some of the other options.

790
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,720
But it doesn't need maybe the same complicated maintenance

791
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,680
that a whole graphical GUI does to do the same task.

792
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,080
So I think there might be some sweet spots in between

793
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,040
where we can have some better methods

794
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,680
to introduce people to the command line

795
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,480
because there's that part where, you know,

796
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,520
you're almost having a conversation back and forth

797
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,640
with a computer and in some ways it can be simpler.

798
00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:00,400
I agree that we could have as good a desktop experience

799
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,640
on Linux as, you know,

800
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,120
people that are super familiar with Windows or Mac OS

801
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,800
have on those platforms.

802
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,160
But I don't think we should pursue that

803
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,600
and forsake, you know, the command line in the process

804
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,300
because the command line is the super user's

805
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,740
killer macro feature.

806
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,920
And it's also Linux's USP.

807
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,200
We have that, nobody else does.

808
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,840
And that's why Linux runs the world right now

809
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,940
because it isn't bound to a graphical user interface.

810
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,960
So I think we should keep it

811
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,720
and we should make the terminal experience better

812
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,640
and we should have more terminal utilities and tools

813
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,360
to supercharge our experience there.

814
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,280
But there's no reason why we can't have a slick UI

815
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,440
on top as well.

816
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,760
Yeah, I wanna encourage people

817
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,600
to look at the command line a little differently.

818
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,740
And I've been trying to think about legitimately

819
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,160
how we could do it on this show.

820
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,960
And I think talking about tools like NCDU

821
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,820
or just talking about that kind of stuff

822
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:00,620
a little more frequently might help a little bit.

823
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,100
And so Wimpy, if I could get your permission,

824
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,120
I'd like to continue on the command line love segment

825
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,500
from time to time here in the show

826
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,400
to sort of inspired by the Ubuntu podcast,

827
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,660
carried on with respect and love

828
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,600
and feature a command line tool from time to time

829
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,420
here in the show to try to, you know, not push people,

830
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,320
not be pushy, not do that kind of thing,

831
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,620
but just walk people through cool stuff

832
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,880
you can do on the command line

833
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,200
and say it's out there if you want it.

834
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,920
Yeah, that well is very deep.

835
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,160
You will never gonna run out of, you know,

836
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,240
love for the command line there.

837
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,480
No, so I mean, it's inspired,

838
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,440
I admit completely by the Ubuntu podcast.

839
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,760
The command line love segment was great.

840
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,800
And so from time to time,

841
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,720
I should have thought of one for today,

842
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,520
but that's just thinking about this.

843
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,200
I guess we'll make it NCDU.

844
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,520
But I just, something we could do

845
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,360
to put a focus on great command line tools

846
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,880
so you can give us some of your ideas

847
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,280
at linuxunplug.com slash contact.

848
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,440
And you know, maybe tools that we already have

849
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,920
that we could just use a little better.

850
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,280
Things we've forgotten about

851
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,220
that still need a little bit of love.

852
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,180
There's a ton of that stuff.

853
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,940
Speaking of things we've forgotten about,

854
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:07,400
we have a couple of new options up at jupytergarage.com.

855
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,000
Some random swag bags are back,

856
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,040
including old swag and some new swag from the road trip,

857
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,120
some new stickers, some old stickers,

858
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:18,040
bonus road trip swag items at jupytergarage.com.

859
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,740
The swag bag is back.

860
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,680
We also, for $5 more,

861
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:26,080
have a random swag bag with the Jupiter journal.

862
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,000
So it's the same great random swag bag,

863
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,040
but we also are including a limited edition JB notebook.

864
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,800
It's got the rocket pressed in on it.

865
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,000
It's really nice, it's a good size.

866
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,480
And we'll include that in the swag bag with journal

867
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,880
for $5 more.

868
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,600
Or you could just go grab the journal if you want.

869
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,080
You pay a little bit for it.

870
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,680
Well, not really, it's like seven or eight bucks.

871
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,020
It's pretty much what the cost is.

872
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,040
But you can pick your color if you just buy the journal

873
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,120
by itself, because there is a blue version

874
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,320
and a gray version.

875
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,920
It's nice, it's great for taking notes.

876
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,680
It lays flat, I love it a lot.

877
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,220
And then just for fun, because it's the winter,

878
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:04,760
I've also added a bearded tux bomber jacket.

879
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,400
It's pretty nice, it's low key.

880
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,440
It didn't want it to shout that you're a geek,

881
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,040
but I wanted a nice subtle low key

882
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,920
where you could still fly your geek flag

883
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,200
without making a big fuss about it.

884
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,360
And so the bearded tux bomber jacket

885
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,440
is also up at jupytergarage.com.

886
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,360
So two new random swag bags.

887
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,560
There's not a ton, but we have at least enough

888
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,580
to do 10 right now, I think.

889
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,080
And they'll go quick.

890
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,280
And then we will ship out what we've got.

891
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,320
We'll check both.

892
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,960
I got two different swag caches

893
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,480
that were sent to me since the road trip.

894
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,720
So we ended up with a bunch more

895
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,600
so we can do some more swag bags.

896
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:44,760
And the journal just, it turned out great.

897
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,120
It's something I set up a while ago

898
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,440
and I've been waiting for the right moment

899
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,600
and it just seems like now is it.

900
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,440
So if I were you, I'd spend the extra five bucks

901
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,360
and get the one with the journal

902
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,720
or go grab a journal directly.

903
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,280
There's not a ton of any of this stuff

904
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,120
because we're not a big warehouse.

905
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,620
So go to jupytergarage.com and go grab some of that stuff

906
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:07,200
because I like all of it a lot, including that jacket.

907
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,480
Might be all I'm wearing right now as a matter of fact.

908
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,920
And we'll do a little housekeeping.

909
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,880
Go check out Linux Action News 214.

910
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,600
We busted some thick Red Hat FUD this week

911
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,360
and we chatted about a new Ubuntu desktop tool in the works,

912
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,600
a brand new tool written in Flutter for the Ubuntu desktop.

913
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,000
Covered that a little bit.

914
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,920
And don't miss Self-Hosted 57.

915
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,080
Alex is building a Self-Hosted Notion Notes replacement.

916
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,260
He's just getting that started and it's awesome.

917
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,720
And he also shares the story

918
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,980
of how he accidentally deleted his server disk setup.

919
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:47,760
Oh, I got him to share that on the show.

920
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,680
So that's Self-Hosted.show.57 if you'd like that.

921
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,560
Thank you to our members at unpluggedcore.com.

922
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,740
I'm gonna go there after the show today

923
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,700
and plug in the member discount, same promo code as before.

924
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,040
So you can take a little money off our original swag items.

925
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,060
The bags, they're just sold at cost,

926
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:06,020
but the jacket and whatnot, the new original swag stuff.

927
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:09,000
Members get a little bit off that merch, unpluggedcore.com.

928
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,620
You also get two feeds to choose from,

929
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:13,420
a full live stream edition.

930
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,520
We run it through some compressor, but that's about it.

931
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,800
It's just everything uncut, every mistake, everything.

932
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,400
Or you can get a limited ad feed.

933
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,300
Nice tight production, just less ads.

934
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,480
And you support the show.

935
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,520

It's at noon Pacific, jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar

942
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:48,860
for that.

943
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,680
We have some feedback this week, quite a bit of it.

944
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,520
Akseli got tired of the Windows 10 update

945
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,560
and gave Linux a try.

946
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:03,560
He writes, here's a very long, enthusiastic ramble

947
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,940
I wrote about Linux and I just really wanted to share.

948
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:10,100
To start, I'm not completely new to using Linux though.

949
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,600
Since I installed my first Linux on my Xbox,

950
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,720
the classic first one.

951
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,180
I've also tinkered with it every now and then

952
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,320
with my other devices,

953
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,840
but never really fully committed to it.

954
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,280
That changed this summer.

955
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,120
I was tired of Windows 10 updates,

956
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,360
but most importantly, I read all around the internet

957
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,860
that games are now working better and better on Linux.

958
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:33,000
Now I like gaming a lot and I also like making games

959
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,240
and I felt like it's now or never, I gotta try this.

960
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,760
I got myself a Kubuntu ISO and did the switch.

961
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,960
Although I left my Windows 10 installation

962
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,480
on my other drive.

963
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,040
Probably good thinking.

964
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,040
Yet here I am almost six months later

965
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,800
and I haven't touched my Windows installation at all.

966
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,000
I've rediscovered my enthusiasm for computers

967
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,440
due to being able to actually look inside of everything

968
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,160
to see how things work.

969
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,040
I can fix my issues myself.

970
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,180
As an example, myself and some others on GitHub

971
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:03,620
figured out how to fix the GSP 670 headset

972
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:06,000
to make it work properly on Linux.

973
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,120
And now that fix is in the kernel.

974
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,760
On Windows, I would have had to wait

975
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,700
for the manufacturer to fix the issues,

976
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,360
but on Linux, we just rolled up our sleeves

977
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,240
and began to figure things out.

978
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,240
All the games I play from Eevee Online to Quake Champions

979
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,860
work really well thanks to Steam Proton

980
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,100
and that it's big for me.

981
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,540
Sure, there are some issues sometimes,

982
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,020
but then the community for the game

983
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,440
will either butt heads together and figure things out

984
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,760
or work with the developers if they're chill enough

985
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,040
and soon we're back to gaming.

986
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,720
On the game dev side, I've felt way more productive too.

987
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,760
Unity works really well on Linux.

988
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,240
I started learning how to use NeoVim.

989
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,400
I really, really love it.

990
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,360
And my open source game project

991
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,720
is much, much easier to work on in Linux

992
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,480
since C development is much easier to set up.

993
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,400
Here's a link to his game called XMO Game.

994
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,480
He continues, I also created a tool

995
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,440
for Elder Scrolls Online players,

996
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,600
a native GTK app that downloads add-ons for the game

997
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,740
since the semi-official tools don't really work with wine.

998
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,820
It's not as feature rich,

999
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:09,780
but it makes the add-on updating way easier.

1000
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:13,400
That's ESOLinux add-on manager, we'll link to that.

1001
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,940
And he continues, just being able to contribute

1002
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:18,540
to a community of computer enthusiasts like this,

1003
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:21,200
just doing things and helping each other.

1004
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,080
I hope I can contribute to the Linux community

1005
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,680
in the future too, and my future games

1006
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,520
will be made Linux first.

1007
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,600
All in all, I'm super happy that I switched to Linux.

1008
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,440
I haven't had this much fun using my computer

1009
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,360
for a long time, and I think it's pretty much all thanks

1010
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,120
to gaming being way more possible on Linux now

1011
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,200
since it is a very big part of my life.

1012
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,880
Oh, that's just great.

1013
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,320
You know, I love that sentiment that you have this fun

1014
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,680
and excitement and discovery as you're trying out Linux.

1015
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,040
I mean, you can have the bad sides too, right?

1016
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:49,320
And maybe this LTT video is some of the dark side to that

1017
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,000
when you have to do that and you don't,

1018
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,680
you haven't really opted into it.

1019
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,280
But the upsides are, yeah, if you're interested

1020
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,880
in this stuff, you know, in the Linux world,

1021
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,600
it's all exposed for you to learn about if you want.

1022
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,480
Yeah, just enjoy the process, right?

1023
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,840
Don't rush it, don't make it a challenge

1024
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,760
where you give yourself a timeline.

1025
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,840
Don't do that stuff.

1026
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,040
Well, and it sounds to me like it's building a community

1027
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,640
behind these games of a very different sort

1028
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,880
than just players, but also developers.

1029
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,920
And that's kind of really fascinating to me.

1030
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,720
So we got a lot of folks, like a handful,

1031
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,920
a bushel of that wrote in and said,

1032
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,600
we should try out Silverblue or KinoKnight.

1033
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,800
So that is on our list of kind of to-do.

1034
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,520
We kind of have a list right now of items

1035
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,440
because we also have our server that we need to work on.

1036
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,040
We have the router, firewall, VPN box

1037
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,920
that we still need to build.

1038
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,360
We got projects, baby.

1039
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,360
Yeah, we do.

1040
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,040
And it's just parts that are coming in slowly,

1041
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,160
but surely they are arriving right now.

1042
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,880
And so we may, you know, maybe after that,

1043
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,240
we may revisit Silverblue or KinoKnight.

1044
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,680
I could see that.

1045
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,200
People thought, you know, give it a real go

1046
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,040
is what they was the general sentiment is,

1047
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,960
you know, don't just look at it,

1048
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,680
but really give it a go and live with it for a bit,

1049
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,520
which I would be down for that when the time was right.

1050
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,040
I had a discussion with George Castro along those lines

1051
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:07,040
on Thursday or Friday last, Thursday last week,

1052
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,760
where we were sort of saying, you know,

1053
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,840
this is where people need to be setting their minds

1054
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,360
to what the future of, you know,

1055
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,920
the Linux desktop looks like.

1056
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,560
And we were looking at Fedora, Silverblue,

1057
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,400
and then using containers for all the messy stuff

1058
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,680
that we do, you know, software development,

1059
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,360
playing games and all of that sort of thing.

1060
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,480
So yeah, Silverblue plus Toolbox

1061
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,800
is a fairly potent offering.

1062
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,040
I'm very keen on NixOS for similar, you know,

1063
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,840
for similar reasons.

1064
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,680
Yeah.

1065
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,680
I am happy to hear you say that, Wimpy,

1066
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,720
because that has been my observation as well.

1067
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:44,320
And, you know, we kind of watch this stuff

1068
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:48,120
and I feel like there has been a lot more chatter

1069
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:51,720
about Silverblue with the Fedora 35 release

1070
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,880
than in previous releases.

1071
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,200
Like it seems to me, awareness is really picking up.

1072
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,000
And I think a lot more people are starting to see it

1073
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,920
the way you see it, Wimpy, and seeing it as

1074
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,240
this is probably the way things need to go

1075
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,800
for a really robust workstation.

1076
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,000
And so I get that,

1077
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,040
which means we probably should give it a really solid go.

1078
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:13,560
I also saw an Ubuntu effort along this line

1079
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,840
that's also using OSTree.

1080
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,760
I don't think it's using Ubuntu core has launched.

1081
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,640
I don't know, I don't think it's official,

1082
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:22,680
but I don't know if you saw that go by the internets.

1083
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,480
We also, as a last bit of feedback for this week,

1084
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,840
we got a letter from listener Chris.

1085
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,960
He writes, Chris, I love Macedon,

1086
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,440
but it's not clear to me it's right for you.

1087
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,760
You've repeatedly said your goal is to reach your audience

1088
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,360
and Twitter in the large or matrix up close and personal

1089
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,480
may be your best bets for that.

1090
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,560
I love that it's the wild West.

1091
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,440
I was temporarily banned from Twitter for saying,

1092
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,720
don't shoot yourself in the foot

1093
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,120
as allegedly this promoted self-harm.

1094
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,760
Macedon reminds me of the nineties internet,

1095
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,520
wild, wooly, and full of all kinds of people

1096
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,800
with an equally diverse range of beliefs and opinions

1097
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,000
and a whole bunch of outstanding technical content,

1098
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,080
but you have to be willing to invest the time

1099
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,040
and seek it out and engage with it.

1100
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,040
Is that for you?

1101
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,320
I'm not sure.

1102
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,960
Thanks for all you do.

1103
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,040
He also says, PS, maybe consider giving the KD spin

1104
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,800
a try in fedora 35.

1105
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,120
Well, see our last episode for that.

1106
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,000
And thanks for listening.

1107
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
That's right.

1108
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,160
I think that's a pretty good take listener, Chris.

1109
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,320
I appreciate that.

1110
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:25,200
And I am finding my feet.

1111
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,800
I was really bad about matrix this last week.

1112
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,960
I kind of messed up somehow in element.

1113
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:30,880
I don't know where I went wrong,

1114
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,520
but every room I joined,

1115
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,800
my notifications are on by default.

1116
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,160
And so I look at my phone sometimes and I'll see like,

1117
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,640
I have 30 unread notifications

1118
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,240
and I just, I can't bring myself to open it.

1119
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,520
That doesn't make you want to check them.

1120
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,560
Nope.

1121
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,920
But I got that, I caught up.

1122
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,720
I'm back current again.

1123
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,440
And I do like the conversations I see happening

1124
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,680
in that matrix room.

1125
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,520
Yeah, me too.

1126
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,640
It's some really good,

1127
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:59,000
just organic community discussion about neat tech stuff

1128
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,800
and a lot of stuff I might miss otherwise.

1129
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,880
Yeah, it's interesting how it's sort of shaking out

1130
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,120
right now.

1131
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,360
And I don't really know how many days are left

1132
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,400
for our IRC room,

1133
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,840
because it seems like it pretty much goes to idle,

1134
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,680
except for when we're live now,

1135
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:15,800
but the matrix and telegram are popping along all day long.

1136
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,760
So we'll see, we'll see.

1137
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,800
I mean, I just don't know if I could, why shut it down

1138
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,240
when you could, well, we can't bridge it

1139
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,960
because of geek shit, I suppose.

1140
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:24,800
Right.

1141
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,160
Put a user in there who just hit links to the matrix a lot.

1142
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,360
Hey, they're over here.

1143
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,200
Hey.

1144
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,520
Every five minutes.

1145
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,360
Brentpot.

1146
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,320
So we have a cut, well, it's like a pick pack.

1147
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,240
It's a pick pack for you this week.

1148
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,360
A whole pack of picks?

1149
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,800
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1150
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,920
A really, really, really awesome,

1151
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:48,680
but complicated backup tool for GNU slash Linux

1152
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,440
is Borg Backup.

1153
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,280
Yeah.

1154
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,600
Talked about it on TechSnap forever ago.

1155
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,880
Yeah, you're familiar with it, Wes?

1156
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:55,960
I sure am.

1157
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,080
Borg Backup is a really solid, comprehensive,

1158
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,120
old schoolish backup solution.

1159
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:04,560
And today, I'm gonna tell you about Vorta.

1160
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,760
And Vorta is a desktop client that simplifies Borg Backup

1161
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,520
into a pretty easy interface.

1162
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,440
It gives you a lot of the same power,

1163
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,160
but walks you through setting some of it up.

1164
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,600
A great example of where a GUI can take something

1165
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,520
and make it discoverable, as a matter of fact.

1166
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,520
It helps you manage your encrypted backups,

1167
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:23,360
it does de-duplication, it'll compress the backups.

1168
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:26,240
Of course, it's all open source, works even on Mac OS,

1169
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:31,040
if you wanna backup your Macintosh-based system.

1170
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,880
And it's available on Flathub.

1171
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,920
If you want a quick install, there's packages available

1172
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,520
for your distro of choice, V-O-R-T-A.

1173
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,800
Do you recognize the name, Wes?

1174
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,040
Oh, I sure do.

1175
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,880
Look at them keeping the Star Trek references going.

1176
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,840
I mean, I was already pretty fond of this tool,

1177
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,640
but now, I'm definitely giving it a go.

1178
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,720
Yeah, yeah, I encourage to go over to, if you can,

1179
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,480
go over to Flathub and search for Vorta

1180
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,440
and just look at the screenshots of it.

1181
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,600
It's really straightforward.

1182
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:01,320
It's a little more old school in terms of backup,

1183
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,840
but that might be what you're looking for

1184
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,920
for this kind of tool.

1185
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,640
Well, yeah, and Borg's already something

1186
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,520
that I felt comfortable using,

1187
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,560
but maybe unless I was totally managing the process,

1188
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,400
it might not show up on some of my supported systems

1189
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,520
of family or friends or something,

1190
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,440
but this adds a new layer on top

1191
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,440
that might push that into the next category.

1192
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,920
Totally, totally, so go check it out.

1193
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,640
We'll have a link in the show notes, all of that.

1194
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,560
Everything we talked about today

1195
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:28,520
is linked at linuxonplug.com, slash, four, three, one.

1196
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,800
You can get all that good stuff right there.

1197
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,720
You'll find links to our profiles over there as well.

1198
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,720
We just sort of put it all there.

1199
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,640
It makes it easy, you know?

1200
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:39,920
And then, really, all you have to remember

1201
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,280
is when we do it live,

1202
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,400
because you can always go get everything

1203
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,440
we talked about from the website,

1204
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,240
but when do they do it live?

1205
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,520
When do they do it?

1206
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,360
6 a.m.

1207
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,760
No, no, well, yeah, where?

1208
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,720
It must be 6 a.m. somewhere, right?

1209
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:55,240
Here, we'll do a little, what is it called?

1210
00:47:55,240 --> 00:48:00,240
Like neurolinguisty, neurolasagna.

1211
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,360
I'm not sure what it's called.

1212
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,840
Neurolinguistics, something like that.

1213
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,640
I think it's called neurolasagna, that sounds right,

1214
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,960
where we will program your brain

1215
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,560
by associating it with something else.

1216
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:16,240
So when I say join us live Tuesdays, noon Pacific,

1217
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,400
and then you hear.

1218
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,680
See you next week.

1219
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:21,280
Same bad time, same bad station.

1220
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,920
Now, I'll do that over and over again

1221
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,680
for the next three years.

1222
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,120
Every time you hear that, you'll think,

1223
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:30,360
ah, Linux Unplugged, Tuesday, noon Pacific,

1224
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:33,680
3 p.m. Eastern, jblive.tv.

1225
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,160
I admit, it's gonna take a little while,

1226
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,560
but I'm committed to it.

1227
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,720
I'll eventually have everyone saying it.

1228
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,200
My plan, my ultimate plan, it's been revealed.

1229
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,600
I think it's gonna be a huge success.

1230
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,520
Thank you so much for joining us

1231
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,200
on this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

1232
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,440
We'd love your feedback, your comments,

1233
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:52,000
your ideas, your picks, your command line tips

1234
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,760
for some command line love

1235
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,560
at linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

1236
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,080
Go there, send them in,

1237
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:00,640
and we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1238
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:19,640
The Unplugged program is a production of Linux Unplugged.

1239
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:39,880
So I meant to fit this in the show,

1240
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:44,360
but I forgot I do have a slight minor Starlink update.

1241
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,840
Number one with a bullet that is bugging me about Starlink

1242
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,520
is I have to say it's really unfortunate

1243
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:52,360
that the ethernet cable does not detach from Dishy.

1244
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,640
It is permanently plugged into Dishy.

1245
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,120
It's baked in?

1246
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:59,720
Yeah, so like when I'm packing up,

1247
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,280
I have to like bring in a wet dish

1248
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,680
with a wet 100 foot ethernet cord.

1249
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,320
And when I wanna run it out my window and all,

1250
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,880
it's just, it's not ideal.

1251
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,480
It'd be really nice to be able to, you know,

1252
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,200
plug it in like an ethernet cable.

1253
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:15,800
The other thing is, is you need to shut it down in the app.

1254
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,800
Otherwise you have to kind of forcibly collapse

1255
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,200
the leg down and it feels like you're breaking it.

1256
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:23,240
But yeah, that's neither here nor there.

1257
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,320
You just gotta remember to shut it down

1258
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,240
before you pack it up.

1259
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,320
Not many people will be moving it around.

1260
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,080
And then the last little thing that I have

1261
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:32,800
just sort of as a followup is you really do have

1262
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,280
to update your service address when you move.

1263
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,120
I tried to move within the 30 mile radius

1264
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,080
and see if it kept working.

1265
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:40,680
And I was just getting poor, poor, poor results.

1266
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,800
Went in and updated my service address,

1267
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,520
which I was a little nervous to do

1268
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:47,000
because I was worried it would say sorry, no availability.

1269
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,480
But it updated just fine.

1270
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,840
And then within about 15, 20 minutes,

1271
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:51,800
my service has been great,

1272
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,760
even with some blockage from tree leaves.

1273
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,080
So it's been really good.

1274
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,960
And other than those little minor things,

1275
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,280
I'm still really enjoying the StarLinks.

1276
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,440
The StarLinks to the internet has been fantastic.

1277
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,680
All right, did I stall long enough?

1278
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,800
Do we have an arch update?

1279
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,760
Oh, we're ready to reboot.

1280
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,080
All right, let's do it.

1281
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:08,920
Rebooting.

1282
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:17,440
And it looks like J-Bot's having problems connecting to GeekShed.

1283
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,240
All right, we'll see how long that takes.

1284
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,520
I'm getting in position to start the pinging.

1285
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,880
Ping's in progress.

1286
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,760
Oh, man, I should have mentioned in Coda Radio this week,

1287
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,600
I did a takedown of Craig Federighi

1288
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:32,560
and this horrible talk that he gave at a web summit

1289
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:35,520
about how dangerous and scary sideloading is.

1290
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,800
And the Mac press has not talked about it.

1291
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,420
I mean, they announced that it happened.

1292
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:42,600
But nobody's really talked about the contents of his speech.

1293
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,600
And it's so cringey.

1294
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,120
And it's clearly Apple's new position on sideloading

1295
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:49,960
or firm position.

1296
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,540
So I recommend you do actually listen.

1297
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:53,280
So that'll be in Coda Radio tomorrow.

1298
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,000
Oh, oh, oh, are we back?

1299
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,080
Did we actually ever stop?

1300
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,600
That part I'm not sure about.

1301
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,720
Is it still shutting down?

1302
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,640
Is it just taking a long time to shut down?

1303
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:04,240
Because I don't think it actually stopped pinging.

1304
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,080
I tell you what, Wes, this is stressful.

1305
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:08,840
It is stressful.

1306
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:11,760
I was thinking maybe I could jump on the jitzy

1307
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,400
and I could go out in the garage.

1308
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,760
You should do that anyway.

1309
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,680
All right, I mean, this took a little while when

1310
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,760
I rebooted before for ZFS.

1311
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,160
Hey, whoa, it's Chris.

1312
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,000
Chris got a rocking beard, too.

1313
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,740
Yeah, his beard's looking great right now.

1314
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:29,440
I don't have any lights out here at the moment.

1315
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,840
Is it booted, Wes?

1316
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:31,920
No pings yet.

1317
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:36,160
OK, I'm going in the garage to get a little light.

1318
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,680
And I'll go to the console.

1319
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,160
We'll see.

1320
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,520
This actually works way better than how it normally does,

1321
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:45,120
because you can see Chris's trepidation here.

1322
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,920
All right, I'm bringing it up.

1323
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,200
I've got my remote hands if I need them.

1324
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,360
Uh-oh, that doesn't seem good.

1325
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,760
What's it showing on screen?

1326
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,520
So what it says is that the monitors for new snapshots

1327
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,080
has failed.

1328
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:00,240
It's a snapper dependency service.

1329
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,400
But I think it is booting.

1330
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,760
Yeah, so let's start it up.

1331
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,400
Most likely what's happened is that it

1332
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,160
failed to create a snapshot.

1333
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:06,920
Yeah.

1334
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:07,800
All right, good.

1335
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,040
Go, Biggie.

1336
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:12,800
Just in time for this server to fall apart.

1337
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,000
Right, just time for the snapshot to quit working.

1338
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,160
Oh, I'm getting pings.

1339
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,600
So is it accepting connections yet?

1340
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:21,440
Yes, it is.

1341
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,520
It is, I'm in.

1342
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:25,040
I'm just about to do a Docker PS here

1343
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,720
and see what we got going for us.

1344
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,120
I'm about to do a mount.

1345
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:30,840
Oh, yeah, I see a lot of ZFS stuff mounted.

1346
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:31,400
Yes.

1347
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,400
Sweet, Wes.

1348
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,920
You know what I think that is, then?

1349
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:40,760
Good job, Wes.

1350
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,760
All our containers up and going.

1351
00:53:42,760 --> 00:54:11,320
Hello, little friends.
