This is Linux Unplugged Episode 2 for August 19th, 2013.

00:30.000 --> 00:41.460
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, our second episode, a show that I won't say cleans up after the

00:41.460 --> 00:45.160
sloppy seconds of the Linux Action Show, but it's definitely inspired from the Linux Action

00:45.160 --> 00:46.160
Show.

00:46.160 --> 00:47.160
My name is Chris.

00:47.160 --> 00:48.160
My name is Matt.

00:48.160 --> 00:49.160
Hey, Matt.

00:49.160 --> 00:50.160
Welcome to number two, man.

00:50.160 --> 00:51.160
Welcome.

00:51.160 --> 00:52.160
Right on.

00:52.160 --> 00:55.200
So this week we're going to... a big part of Linux Unplugged going forward is audience

00:55.200 --> 00:56.960
interaction because we've got some smart people out there.

00:56.960 --> 00:58.680
We want to get the community involved.

00:58.680 --> 01:02.000
Arbulous in our chat room set us up with a mumble server on a hosted system.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.760
We actually had a couple of people that did some projects for us around mumble.

01:05.760 --> 01:06.760
It was really awesome.

01:06.760 --> 01:10.640
But Arbulous set us up a hosted server and we're just having a few issues.

01:10.640 --> 01:12.320
I installed mumble right before the show started.

01:12.320 --> 01:14.320
It didn't work out, but don't fret, Matt.

01:14.320 --> 01:15.600
I don't want you to stress.

01:15.600 --> 01:16.600
I am not stressed.

01:16.600 --> 01:19.360
You know, I think I can keep myself seated and calm.

01:19.360 --> 01:20.360
Oh, okay.

01:20.360 --> 01:21.360
Good.

01:21.360 --> 01:22.360
Good.

01:22.360 --> 01:23.360
I think I'll be all right.

01:23.360 --> 01:24.360
All right.

01:24.360 --> 01:25.360
Well, you know what?

01:25.360 --> 01:26.360
We'll open up the Skype line and then folks can call in as we go.

01:26.360 --> 01:27.360
Exactly.

01:27.360 --> 01:31.240
And so today, should we start with follow up stuff from last week's episode?

01:31.240 --> 01:32.240
What do you think?

01:32.240 --> 01:33.240
Or I guess yesterday's episode?

01:33.240 --> 01:34.240
I guess that would be yesterday.

01:34.240 --> 01:35.240
Yeah.

01:35.240 --> 01:37.760
I think that's a good plan because there's a lot of stuff that we've thought of and I'm

01:37.760 --> 01:39.240
sure that the audience has as well.

01:39.240 --> 01:40.240
Yeah.

01:40.240 --> 01:42.640
You know, you and I were just talking a little bit during the pre-show that, you know, you

01:42.640 --> 01:47.840
poked a little more at elementary and I realized, so I guess we should back up.

01:47.840 --> 01:53.280
Yesterday in the Linux action show, Sunday, we reviewed elementary OS Luna and big review,

01:53.280 --> 01:54.280
highly anticipated.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.420
I think probably everybody knows about it.

01:56.420 --> 02:00.960
And it's funny because I definitely missed a couple of aspects in the review.

02:00.960 --> 02:01.960
I knew I would.

02:01.960 --> 02:03.080
I knew I would.

02:03.080 --> 02:06.200
And the one that struck me is I thought maybe a point that I should have made during the

02:06.200 --> 02:11.880
review was that I could see this being a really good desktop elementary OS Luna for developers

02:11.880 --> 02:16.640
because you got a good, clean, efficient system that really lets you focus on your work.

02:16.640 --> 02:21.240
And I think for developers, there's some value in that Ubuntu LTS compatibility and support.

02:21.240 --> 02:29.920
You know, you get applications that are targeted for Ubuntu LTS, especially in the work sector.

02:29.920 --> 02:34.040
And with that UI and all of that, I really think it would be a compelling developer's

02:34.040 --> 02:35.040
desktop.

02:35.040 --> 02:38.000
I think it's an amazing developer's desktop and I think once you accept the fact that

02:38.000 --> 02:42.400
they're not trying to target people that want lots of settings, it begins to make a lot

02:42.400 --> 02:43.400
of sense.

02:43.400 --> 02:44.400
I think that's the one fall down.

02:44.400 --> 02:46.520
A lot of people look at it and say, oh, how do I do this?

02:46.520 --> 02:47.520
How do I do that?

02:47.520 --> 02:48.640
I can't find my settings.

02:48.640 --> 02:50.880
It's not necessarily designed for options on its options.

02:50.880 --> 02:52.280
You want KDE if you want that.

02:52.280 --> 02:56.720
I think, you know, that is why it didn't work for me.

02:56.720 --> 03:02.180
Because I feel like I have watched over the last couple of years my options be removed

03:02.180 --> 03:09.080
from me as a user and I'm just now I am sort of the pendulum is swung and now I just want

03:09.080 --> 03:10.080
everything.

03:10.080 --> 03:14.240
Give it all to me and I will just deal with the complexity because I prefer to have the

03:14.240 --> 03:16.360
complexity than not to have the flexibility.

03:16.360 --> 03:17.360
Exactly.

03:17.360 --> 03:18.360
Yeah.

03:18.360 --> 03:23.000
And that's kind of my thing on it, too, is that I found myself I was drawn to the simplicity

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
of it.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.640
But then I realized that there are other ways of making an existing desktop six XFC or whatever

03:28.640 --> 03:32.480
it may be open box, other simplistic desktops that you can still do that with.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.080
So I wasn't limited to going just that route.

03:35.080 --> 03:42.320
OK, let's put our time machine caps on and project way out in the future.

03:42.320 --> 03:48.120
And Ubuntu has really gotten some traction with sort of carriers taking Ubuntu and putting

03:48.120 --> 03:50.800
it on old Android devices that didn't sell very well.

03:50.800 --> 03:51.800
And now they're all running.

03:51.800 --> 03:55.080
This is like two years from now and they're all running like Ubuntu Touch and they're

03:55.080 --> 03:59.880
selling it as like the Verizon OS and all of this junked up crap.

03:59.880 --> 04:00.880
Right.

04:00.880 --> 04:05.480
And the and the progress on the Ubuntu desktop continues, but it sees less and less attention

04:05.480 --> 04:06.720
as time goes on.

04:06.720 --> 04:09.200
This seems like a potential reality in a few years.

04:09.200 --> 04:10.200
Right.

04:10.200 --> 04:11.200
It does.

04:11.200 --> 04:14.640
That leaves companies and I'm wearing my system 76 shirt right now, but that leaves companies

04:14.640 --> 04:18.100
like system 76 in a real bad spot.

04:18.100 --> 04:22.200
It's going to force them to make some tough choices and to really look at where they want

04:22.200 --> 04:23.440
to go in future directions.

04:23.440 --> 04:25.720
And I think that they're resilient enough that they would adapt.

04:25.720 --> 04:26.720
Oh, sure.

04:26.720 --> 04:27.720
But it certainly creates a hassle.

04:27.720 --> 04:29.880
Well, think about this.

04:29.880 --> 04:34.720
That same time is another couple of years of polish and new applications and improved

04:34.720 --> 04:37.720
on the existing applications for elementary OS.

04:37.720 --> 04:44.660
Maybe elementary OS sort of becomes like the OS 10 of desktop Linux that a company like

04:44.660 --> 04:49.440
system 76, who is very, you know, they have very high end products.

04:49.440 --> 04:53.960
In some regards, Ubuntu is almost not good enough for the system 76 hardware.

04:53.960 --> 04:54.960
And they don't sponsor this show.

04:54.960 --> 04:59.160
I'm just saying that like the hardware is better than the operating systems.

04:59.160 --> 05:05.880
And they like they could I could really see like a slick metal system 76 Ultrabook with

05:05.880 --> 05:11.480
elementary OS on it would be a really, really compelling product that would be competitive

05:11.480 --> 05:13.720
with the MacBook Air.

05:13.720 --> 05:18.360
You know, I would expand on that and go a step further and say in my mind, if they want

05:18.360 --> 05:21.880
to go that route, then they really need to run their own distribution.

05:21.880 --> 05:26.000
And I know that's a ballsy, heavy handed approach.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.680
But but you know, let's say they go with that, you know, they go with elementary and it's

05:29.680 --> 05:30.680
rocking and everything's awesome.

05:30.680 --> 05:33.240
And then all of a sudden, OK, well, the developers done.

05:33.240 --> 05:34.240
Now what?

05:34.240 --> 05:35.240
Oops.

05:35.240 --> 05:36.240
They're back to square one.

05:36.240 --> 05:37.240
Yeah.

05:37.240 --> 05:39.120
But if they were to borrow that code and basically do what like Mint did to where they basically

05:39.120 --> 05:41.960
said, thanks, Ubuntu, this is great, but we're going to start working on our own projects

05:41.960 --> 05:45.720
and actually building away from that based on the same thing, not because they're trying

05:45.720 --> 05:48.780
to be douchey, but just because they want to make sure they're covering their backsides

05:48.780 --> 05:51.400
should the unthinkable happen and they control the whole stack.

05:51.400 --> 05:52.400
And they exactly.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.700
But the thing is, is they're focused on hardware.

05:54.700 --> 05:55.700
They are.

05:55.700 --> 05:58.400
And that's where that's where there's an elementary is focused on UI.

05:58.400 --> 06:03.600
The alternative to that is then maybe they begin to fund elementary to where it's interesting,

06:03.600 --> 06:06.120
higher, maybe higher the dev or help them out a little bit.

06:06.120 --> 06:07.120
Yeah, exactly.

06:07.120 --> 06:11.080
Do a red hat approach or a novel approach to where basically they fund the project where

06:11.080 --> 06:15.240
it's like, OK, we don't have time to manage this, but we need to make sure you guys are.

06:15.240 --> 06:16.240
Yeah.

06:16.240 --> 06:17.520
You know, that would be another alternative.

06:17.520 --> 06:19.880
They don't have that problem with Ubuntu, which is a sweet spot for them.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.120
And it allows them to do what they need to do.

06:22.120 --> 06:24.680
But you know, they they're definitely a hardware company.

06:24.680 --> 06:28.360
So you know, Ubuntu doing weird things would definitely create some issues for them.

06:28.360 --> 06:33.680
Yeah, I think I find it to be in an interesting future where we go.

06:33.680 --> 06:37.040
It's good to see some of these desktops that are coming up that are really offering some

06:37.040 --> 06:39.120
serious alternatives.

06:39.120 --> 06:43.320
And you know, I think we'll just kind of kick back and look forward to future releases of

06:43.320 --> 06:44.320
elementary OS.

06:44.320 --> 06:45.320
Absolutely.

06:45.320 --> 06:46.320
Do you have any other?

06:46.320 --> 06:50.000
Well, one last thought is I like the idea of the unified application stack.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.320
I don't think that's for everybody, but I think for just somebody that in an enterprise

06:54.320 --> 06:57.880
environment or somewhere, they just need, you know, simple applications to do basic

06:57.880 --> 07:00.160
things without a lot of fluff and cruft.

07:00.160 --> 07:03.560
I think that's a nice approach and I'd like to see more of that.

07:03.560 --> 07:09.480
So KDE 4.11 hit my rig this morning before Coder Radio started.

07:09.480 --> 07:15.360
I did the I did the upgrade and I thought, yeah, should I wait until after Coder Radio?

07:15.360 --> 07:16.360
But I didn't.

07:16.360 --> 07:17.360
I didn't wait.

07:17.360 --> 07:18.360
And it turned out fine.

07:18.360 --> 07:23.120
And knock on press board, Matt, haven't had a sound issue yet.

07:23.120 --> 07:24.120
No kidding.

07:24.120 --> 07:25.120
I mean, I did.

07:25.120 --> 07:27.800
We just actually on the pre show had a little sound problem, but that was mumble related.

07:27.800 --> 07:28.800
Not right.

07:28.800 --> 07:35.320
But I've been switching interfaces this morning and so far, so far, no problem.

07:35.320 --> 07:36.320
That's awesome.

07:36.320 --> 07:39.900
And I'm hoping I'm hoping that that sticks because then I'll feel more comfortable about

07:39.900 --> 07:41.840
using KDE more frequently.

07:41.840 --> 07:46.200
I know this is cliche cliche to say, too, but it feels a little faster, too.

07:46.200 --> 07:50.240
Oh, well, now that I do know from what I've read that they well, that was a big sentence.

07:50.240 --> 07:53.920
I know that I've been reading a lot of details that they've been trying to speed things up

07:53.920 --> 07:55.840
to optimize, optimize, optimize.

07:55.840 --> 07:57.560
That's really been a big focus for them.

07:57.560 --> 08:02.560
And so that may continue and that may be what's what we're experiencing now with the new release.

08:02.560 --> 08:06.720
So yesterday in last we covered the steam stats.

08:06.720 --> 08:11.400
And we talked about how it's it's it's probably around Linux usage on steam is about one point

08:11.400 --> 08:14.000
six nine percent or something like that.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.440
And I thought I was looking at this, you know, this is something I've been trying to track

08:17.440 --> 08:21.280
for the show so that we can kind of have a good perspective on the growth of steam and

08:21.280 --> 08:25.440
we can kind of comment on how the how steam is doing on Linux in general.

08:25.440 --> 08:30.840
And I realize that there's really nobody is tracking this number very well.

08:30.840 --> 08:35.040
There's like we get the monthly snapshot, but nobody's like putting it in a database

08:35.040 --> 08:38.800
and charting it and like showing us on a line graph where it's going.

08:38.800 --> 08:39.800
Exactly.

08:39.800 --> 08:42.200
Show me exactly what you're showing me, because I mean, they're just basically throwing numbers

08:42.200 --> 08:44.560
at you, which are meaningless without details.

08:44.560 --> 08:48.480
And they get in like and how do I you know, it's kind of hard to picture how these numbers

08:48.480 --> 08:49.680
compared to three months ago.

08:49.680 --> 08:53.080
It'd be nice if I could, you know, see a trend.

08:53.080 --> 08:58.720
And I find it there's a there's a guy his name is Horace Horace Deju.

08:58.720 --> 09:01.280
He has a website called a Simcoe.

09:01.280 --> 09:02.960
And he does this for the mobile market.

09:02.960 --> 09:08.000
He kind of he he he goes in there and digs out all of the information nuggets out of

09:08.000 --> 09:11.800
the out of the quarterly reports and, you know, publicly available statements.

09:11.800 --> 09:13.640
He digs it all out, gets all the hard numbers.

09:13.640 --> 09:18.520
And then he puts together these incredible graphs and charts of of iPhone versus Android

09:18.520 --> 09:22.960
and iOS seven versus Android four, three, all this other stuff.

09:22.960 --> 09:26.960
That is really good from like a trend analysis standpoint to sit back and go, oh, yeah, I

09:26.960 --> 09:30.000
can definitely see how where these two lines cross each other.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.640
My personal plea, Matt, to the Linux community, if anybody out there is good with graphs and

09:33.640 --> 09:37.640
numbers, maybe take on this watching steam on Linux thing.

09:37.640 --> 09:42.200
I think that one of those beats you could start to follow that as as the time goes on

09:42.200 --> 09:45.640
will sort of grow into a larger and larger role in the Linux community.

09:45.640 --> 09:46.640
That'd be mine.

09:46.640 --> 09:50.200
Well, it'd be awesome if someone could break it down for us just like, OK, exactly what

09:50.200 --> 09:51.560
is truly being said here?

09:51.560 --> 09:52.560
Where are they dropping the ball?

09:52.560 --> 09:55.600
Where where is it falling into the other category?

09:55.600 --> 09:57.400
Which you know, which distros are specifically involved?

09:57.400 --> 10:00.760
I would love some actual meat and potatoes details on what's actually happening and I'm

10:00.760 --> 10:01.760
not seeing that.

10:01.760 --> 10:04.240
It'd be really interesting to be able to like really see like when one distro is starting

10:04.240 --> 10:09.160
to fall off, you know, like, oh, this distro is losing popularity, then we can all gossip

10:09.160 --> 10:10.440
about why that would be.

10:10.440 --> 10:14.520
John Bob's Linux is over surpassing Hannah Montana or whatever, you know, whatever the

10:14.520 --> 10:15.520
thing may be.

10:15.520 --> 10:16.520
I want to know.

10:16.520 --> 10:17.520
Yeah.

10:17.520 --> 10:18.520
All right.

10:18.520 --> 10:21.440
Well, I want to just cover a couple of bits of feedback to this show and then we'll get

10:21.440 --> 10:23.280
into some more some other topics.

10:23.280 --> 10:26.860
But you know, I I'm only going to let us talk about ourselves for so long.

10:26.860 --> 10:30.940
Once we get to like episode five or so, it feels embarrassing to be so self-indulgent.

10:30.940 --> 10:34.160
But we got a really good response to the first episode.

10:34.160 --> 10:35.160
So thank you, everyone.

10:35.160 --> 10:37.080
We're pretty excited about that.

10:37.080 --> 10:42.960
And we got got a lot of people that were very, very happy to see another show.

10:42.960 --> 10:43.960
Like it just surprised them.

10:43.960 --> 10:45.920
They didn't catch the last bit on last and like, what?

10:45.920 --> 10:46.920
Another show?

10:46.920 --> 10:50.360
So, yeah, here is another show that shows a little different.

10:50.360 --> 10:51.580
It's a little less visual centric.

10:51.580 --> 10:52.580
It's more audio centric.

10:52.580 --> 10:57.160
Part of the reason is there's more Linux involved in the production of the show.

10:57.160 --> 11:02.200
All of all of my all of my visuals here are done on all of my notes and everything.

11:02.200 --> 11:04.280
All my Web pages, my chat, everything's on Linux.

11:04.280 --> 11:08.800
And unfortunately, I don't I can't be hardwired into the switcher like I am when I'm in the

11:08.800 --> 11:09.800
studio.

11:09.800 --> 11:10.800
So I can't show you my screen as easy.

11:10.800 --> 11:17.240
Now, I do have a backup Apple Macintosh computer.

11:17.240 --> 11:18.560
They named them after the Apple.

11:18.560 --> 11:19.960
I'm not sure if you're familiar with these guys.

11:19.960 --> 11:22.560
They're not named after the Orange and all this time.

11:22.560 --> 11:26.240
Yeah, it's run by a guy a guy named Wozniak.

11:26.240 --> 11:29.000
He I guess he owns the I'm not I'm not familiar with the details, Matt.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.580
Anyways, I got one of their fruit computers here.

11:31.580 --> 11:33.320
So we do have something we need to show up on the screen.

11:33.320 --> 11:35.720
I can but I probably won't be using it as much.

11:35.720 --> 11:36.720
Just I wanted to kind of make that disclaimer.

11:36.720 --> 11:40.760
And as the tech is that tech gets worked out, that will kind of get solved.

11:40.760 --> 11:45.260
You know, well, I'm trying to come up with a way to remotely get the video screen on

11:45.260 --> 11:48.000
my Linux box to a remote broadcast machine.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.040
I don't have that figured out yet.

11:50.040 --> 11:53.640
There is software available that used to work under wine that Matt and I used to use.

11:53.640 --> 11:56.520
I kind of had to jump through some hoops to make it work.

11:56.520 --> 11:57.800
But we got it to work.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.680
And now that doesn't work anymore either.

11:59.680 --> 12:00.680
Exactly.

12:00.680 --> 12:04.240
And and for those and before anyone mentions, yes, we're aware of Cinderella, we're aware

12:04.240 --> 12:08.360
of VNC, we're aware of all the various Linux applications that allegedly can make you do

12:08.360 --> 12:09.360
this.

12:09.360 --> 12:11.480
I wonder if they don't really they don't really do it well.

12:11.480 --> 12:16.000
No, it really would like VNC like even that would be kind of Yeah, it would not be what

12:16.000 --> 12:19.360
happens if someone chimes and says, Well, you can do it with a, you know, use OpenShot

12:19.360 --> 12:21.240
over here with some Kdenlive on top of that.

12:21.240 --> 12:25.280
And then under this, you use some VNC and then you stand on one foot and through blenders

12:25.280 --> 12:29.200
and exactly like, wait, what and how do you do all this live?

12:29.200 --> 12:30.200
It's like, wait, what now?

12:30.200 --> 12:31.920
It's like, well, you know, they got a green screen.

12:31.920 --> 12:33.320
What's a green screen got to do with an audio show?

12:33.320 --> 12:35.160
I mean, yeah, just gets really out of control.

12:35.160 --> 12:38.540
The other good news is because it's audio, nobody will know that this is a two bear show

12:38.540 --> 12:39.540
for me.

12:39.540 --> 12:43.080
Nobody's gonna know that I'm in the clear, so I don't have to worry about it.

12:43.080 --> 12:44.080
All right.

12:44.080 --> 12:45.400
Well, so guess what?

12:45.400 --> 12:46.400
Guess what?

12:46.400 --> 12:47.400
Pretty excited.

12:47.400 --> 12:48.400
We got two sponsors this week.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.240
So I thought maybe we'd cover our first sponsor.

12:50.240 --> 12:55.560
And then I want to talk after we talk after we talk about our sponsor this week, I want

12:55.560 --> 12:59.840
to cover a little bit more on the steam community.

12:59.840 --> 13:02.880
I want to talk a little bit about rolling my own mail server because I've gotten some

13:02.880 --> 13:03.880
good feedback on that.

13:03.880 --> 13:07.400
And then I'm going to cover some of the emails we've gotten into the show and I will take

13:07.400 --> 13:08.400
some Skype calls too.

13:08.400 --> 13:09.680
So we got a lot coming up.

13:09.680 --> 13:12.520
But first I want to thank Ting.

13:12.520 --> 13:13.520
That's right.

13:13.520 --> 13:16.200
Ting.com is sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

13:16.200 --> 13:17.200
Now Ting is mobile.

13:17.200 --> 13:18.200
That makes sense.

13:18.200 --> 13:21.400
A lot of you guys are familiar with Ting, but Matt, right over there, our very own Matt

13:21.400 --> 13:23.120
is a recent convert.

13:23.120 --> 13:24.120
I am.

13:24.120 --> 13:29.560
Chris was kind enough to get me to the Galaxy Note 2, Samsung Galaxy Note 2.

13:29.560 --> 13:30.600
And it is running Ting.

13:30.600 --> 13:32.720
How much larger is that Note 2 than the Droid?

13:32.720 --> 13:35.640
It's like the Droid was like, was it a four inch screen on the Droid?

13:35.640 --> 13:36.640
It was a decent screen.

13:36.640 --> 13:37.640
Let's see.

13:37.640 --> 13:38.640
I've got my Droid.

13:38.640 --> 13:39.640
Yeah.

13:39.640 --> 13:40.840
Just looking at screen, cause I have a case on it, so it kind of gives an interesting

13:40.840 --> 13:41.840
perspective.

13:41.840 --> 13:44.000
I would say about two inches.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Yeah.

13:45.000 --> 13:50.480
It feels bigger, but that's not a bad thing because it does kind of solve my phablet challenge

13:50.480 --> 13:51.480
that I had previously.

13:51.480 --> 13:52.480
Yeah.

13:52.480 --> 13:53.480
Well, you're not a big tablet guy, right?

13:53.480 --> 13:55.080
So this is right in this, this is in the sweet spot.

13:55.080 --> 13:56.080
Exactly.

13:56.080 --> 13:58.720
Cause I don't really prefer, I don't really like tablets, but I would love something that

13:58.720 --> 14:00.280
could fit in my pocket and this will fit.

14:00.280 --> 14:02.440
And it's like, well, this is great.

14:02.440 --> 14:03.640
Signal strength has been fantastic.

14:03.640 --> 14:08.400
I live in the middle of nowhere and I have Verizon and I have Ting and I'm actually getting

14:08.400 --> 14:13.200
one and I'm, I'm, I'm being completely straight with you guys where I'm located in my home

14:13.200 --> 14:14.200
right now.

14:14.200 --> 14:17.840
I have four bars on Ting and two bars on Verizon.

14:17.840 --> 14:18.840
Don't know.

14:18.840 --> 14:22.960
And what's great is, uh, the, uh, the, uh, barrier to entry is super low.

14:22.960 --> 14:25.880
Like if you, you know, you didn't know before you tried it.

14:25.880 --> 14:26.880
Oh, right.

14:26.880 --> 14:27.880
It was super easy to set up, right?

14:27.880 --> 14:29.440
You were able to, were you able to activate it all through the website?

14:29.440 --> 14:30.920
I was able to activate the whole thing.

14:30.920 --> 14:34.640
I had to disassociate the previous number, which was super simple.

14:34.640 --> 14:35.640
Thanks to their help.

14:35.640 --> 14:39.160
Their help thing typed in, Hey, how do I disassociate previous number?

14:39.160 --> 14:40.160
Typed it in.

14:40.160 --> 14:41.160
It gave me the numbers to dial.

14:41.160 --> 14:42.160
Did it bam, bam, bam.

14:42.160 --> 14:43.160
Restarted the phone.

14:43.160 --> 14:44.160
It re-recognized.

14:44.160 --> 14:45.160
I was good to go.

14:45.160 --> 14:47.520
I was instantly calling people and texting Chris.

14:47.520 --> 14:48.520
Yeah, that's right.

14:48.520 --> 14:49.520
Yeah.

14:49.520 --> 14:50.680
I was pretty impressed.

14:50.680 --> 14:55.800
And uh, the way Ting works, so it's really like zero risk is you only pay for what you

14:55.800 --> 14:56.800
use.

14:56.800 --> 14:58.640
So they just break out your rate by minutes, text message and megabytes.

14:58.640 --> 15:01.240
They'll bill you at the end of the month for whatever bucket you fall into.

15:01.240 --> 15:02.440
And the base rate's like six bucks.

15:02.440 --> 15:06.360
So you know, Matt, if for some reason at one week, one month even, you don't use the phone

15:06.360 --> 15:09.560
for an entire month, you're not out like some crazy amount of money.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.400
You just, you're out what you didn't pay.

15:11.400 --> 15:12.400
Six dollars flat.

15:12.400 --> 15:13.880
You don't, if you didn't use it, you didn't use it.

15:13.880 --> 15:14.880
I love that.

15:14.880 --> 15:16.480
I literally dig through my couch to pay the bill.

15:16.480 --> 15:17.480
I love that.

15:17.480 --> 15:18.480
Right?

15:18.480 --> 15:19.480
It's couch money.

15:19.480 --> 15:21.040
And now also you've got a device you can take with you at all times.

15:21.040 --> 15:25.800
It has built in tethering and hotspot as part of the plan, uh, which is just so nice.

15:25.800 --> 15:30.040
There's no add on charges for things like voicemail, caller ID, three way calling, call

15:30.040 --> 15:33.640
reporting, all that stuff is built in, super easy to manage through the Ting website.

15:33.640 --> 15:39.680
No contract, no overages, no penalties when you want to turn it off and no bundling of

15:39.680 --> 15:41.160
ride along services.

15:41.160 --> 15:43.000
Plus Ting has excellent customer service.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.120
We've gotten letters and letters from people that confirm when they call into Ting, you'll

15:46.120 --> 15:47.440
get an answer within one or two rings.

15:47.440 --> 15:50.960
You'll talk to a real person if you call between eight AM and eight PM, one eight five five

15:50.960 --> 15:51.960
Ting FTW.

15:51.960 --> 15:53.960
They got FTW on their phone number.

15:53.960 --> 15:54.960
Okay.

15:54.960 --> 15:56.200
How cool is that?

15:56.200 --> 15:57.200
How cool is that?

15:57.200 --> 15:58.200
That is awesome.

15:58.200 --> 15:59.200
Go check out Ting.

15:59.200 --> 16:03.800
It's a great cell phone and go get yourself a cell service that knows you're smart.

16:03.800 --> 16:08.980
That's not trying to trick you in and lure you in with a carrot and then trap you.

16:08.980 --> 16:09.980
You guys know better.

16:09.980 --> 16:11.080
I love that there's no weird fees.

16:11.080 --> 16:14.120
It's like when I look at how much I use or what I'm planning on using, and I'll also

16:14.120 --> 16:15.720
love the fact of not going to be nailed on data.

16:15.720 --> 16:18.280
It's just, it just rolls up or down accordingly.

16:18.280 --> 16:19.280
It's awesome.

16:19.280 --> 16:20.280
I'm looking at it.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.280
It's like, oh, that's my, that's my bill.

16:21.280 --> 16:24.140
There's no weird like use fee or anything bizarre.

16:24.140 --> 16:25.140
It's just awesome.

16:25.140 --> 16:29.680
There's certain types of devices and I'd put the, maybe the HTC one and the first iPad,

16:29.680 --> 16:34.360
the, you know, my first tablet experience, even the first Nexus, like when you hold it,

16:34.360 --> 16:36.040
it clicks in a whole new way.

16:36.040 --> 16:38.240
Like, oh, this is a game changer.

16:38.240 --> 16:43.180
I feel that way about Ting and my device when I have, when I have Ting service with a smart

16:43.180 --> 16:46.840
device like that, it's like, okay, so, so this is the future.

16:46.840 --> 16:50.080
It's not as bad as these other telcos are trying to make it.

16:50.080 --> 16:54.480
It's we can actually do this and it, Ting, Ting makes me really excited about the future

16:54.480 --> 16:58.900
of these mobile devices paired within a fantastic service like Ting.

16:58.900 --> 17:03.580
So go to Linux, linux.ting.com.

17:03.580 --> 17:04.580
That's right.

17:04.580 --> 17:07.280
We got the code Linux for Linux Unplugged.

17:07.280 --> 17:08.280
How cool is that?

17:08.280 --> 17:09.280
So go to linux.ting.com.

17:09.280 --> 17:10.280
That's so great.

17:10.280 --> 17:17.220
I love that we got linux.ting.com and save $25 off your first device or $25 off your

17:17.220 --> 17:19.200
first month of service.

17:19.200 --> 17:23.000
Thanks to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Big thank you.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.320
I want to talk a little bit just as a lead up, probably with stood off topic, it'll be

17:27.320 --> 17:28.320
in next week's episode.

17:28.320 --> 17:32.480
I hope we're not bringing people out on this, but listen, the Cindy Go Go's only got hours

17:32.480 --> 17:36.160
left on it, but Ubuntu Edge at this point, it looks like it's not going to make its $32

17:36.160 --> 17:37.160
million goal.

17:37.160 --> 17:41.720
No, no, not unless Trump or some rich dude, some rich guy comes bombing in with a bunch

17:41.720 --> 17:42.720
of money.

17:42.720 --> 17:43.720
I don't see it happen.

17:43.720 --> 17:46.240
Yeah, I thought Crash Bandicoot.

17:46.240 --> 17:51.480
He's in our IRC sub and in our subreddit and he had three points that he felt like were

17:51.480 --> 17:55.840
sort of the major reasons Ubuntu Edge was not going to reach funding.

17:55.840 --> 17:57.600
Number one reason, no hardware to show.

17:57.600 --> 18:00.400
People could read a review of it, they would be more inclined to actually put some money

18:00.400 --> 18:04.040
down because everyone's been burned by big promises in the past.

18:04.040 --> 18:05.040
I think you kind of expressed that.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.040
That's very true.

18:06.040 --> 18:07.040
Yeah.

18:07.040 --> 18:10.560
Number two, hardware specs are nice, but as anyone who's moved from a leg ridden high

18:10.560 --> 18:15.840
end Android to a smooth as butter iOS device and back knows, hardware specs count as almost

18:15.840 --> 18:16.840
nothing these days.

18:16.840 --> 18:21.120
This adds to my above point, without an actual third party review, people don't have enough

18:21.120 --> 18:23.160
data to risk the money.

18:23.160 --> 18:24.600
I think this is absolutely true.

18:24.600 --> 18:30.320
He goes on to mention there's been other things like RAM and storage are locked in, but other

18:30.320 --> 18:31.320
aspects are vague.

18:31.320 --> 18:35.080
He said, we also live in a buy now, pay later society.

18:35.080 --> 18:40.100
This is a huge issue too, and the pay now and receive later model is a difficult one

18:40.100 --> 18:44.320
to sell with fundraising campaigns and the perks aren't priced as high, so people don't

18:44.320 --> 18:48.000
mind risking 20 or 50 bucks here or there to support them, but this is a major outlay

18:48.000 --> 18:51.960
it for a lot of people who are not necessarily even paying one third of this for a phone

18:51.960 --> 18:54.020
that they'd be receiving right then and there.

18:54.020 --> 18:58.760
Even though they're still really painful price, they only see the initial outlay as the expense.

18:58.760 --> 19:01.500
I think that's the big issue right there.

19:01.500 --> 19:06.000
It's not only a matter, as you pointed out, of avoiding the whole buy now, get it later,

19:06.000 --> 19:09.400
the whole instant gratification thing, but the fact that they're saying, okay, drop 600

19:09.400 --> 19:13.160
bucks, 500 bucks, 700 bucks, whatever it may be, and then wait.

19:13.160 --> 19:14.560
Wow, really?

19:14.560 --> 19:16.280
That sucks.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.400
That really sucks.

19:17.400 --> 19:22.720
It's not because the phone sucks, but the experience just... Marketing 101, no one

19:22.720 --> 19:23.720
wants to do that.

19:23.720 --> 19:27.720
It's like, I'm willing to outlay the money, but make darn sure that thing's in the mail.

19:27.720 --> 19:29.240
You know what I mean?

19:29.240 --> 19:32.000
Don't make me wait for six months or whatever it may be.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
Forget that.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
No way.

19:34.000 --> 19:39.080
Yeah, I totally follow you, and I think... So what it is is it's a niche of a niche, because

19:39.080 --> 19:43.420
it's a niche of people who want the Ubuntu operating system and that aren't already satisfied

19:43.420 --> 19:47.180
with the existing products on the market, which is probably the majority, but then once

19:47.180 --> 19:51.240
you take those people down, then you have to go for the niche of the people.

19:51.240 --> 19:54.160
I go back to Mark's example of the formula racing car.

19:54.160 --> 19:56.520
It's a custom built, limited design.

19:56.520 --> 20:03.740
I personally, I am more inclined to buy tech if it's a limited mint edition.

20:03.740 --> 20:09.480
If I'm one of the few 50,000 people or 80,000 people that had an Ubuntu Edge, that's a thrill

20:09.480 --> 20:10.480
for me.

20:10.480 --> 20:15.120
So I'm willing to wait the year, because it's sort of like getting in on an IndyCar race

20:15.120 --> 20:16.120
car kind of thing.

20:16.120 --> 20:24.320
I do kind of see that end of the argument, only it's more at a wage worker's price point

20:24.320 --> 20:25.320
than a race car.

20:25.320 --> 20:26.320
Yeah, exactly.

20:26.320 --> 20:31.080
So I was willing to wait, but I think I am a minority in that regard.

20:31.080 --> 20:34.080
Well, and I think that you touched on something that's really important.

20:34.080 --> 20:40.080
You mentioned the whole, we need to find a way to add an exclusive experience behind

20:40.080 --> 20:47.080
this, whether that's a private conference call with Mark Shuttleworth or a little club

20:47.080 --> 20:50.200
to where they get to see all the behind the scenes stuff that nobody else gets to see

20:50.200 --> 20:51.200
at all.

20:51.200 --> 20:53.240
I mean, give me something now.

20:53.240 --> 20:57.520
I mean, something even mildly compelling now, not later.

20:57.520 --> 21:01.000
I think if they can come up with kind of a club environment to do that, some sort of

21:01.000 --> 21:06.520
a – I don't know what it would be, but their offerings kind of suck right now.

21:06.520 --> 21:10.560
The phone's cool, eventually, maybe if it ever happens, and then of course you're

21:10.560 --> 21:13.720
on top of that battling the fact that you have a mindset of people saying, well, it's

21:13.720 --> 21:15.200
going to fail, so no one's going to bother now.

21:15.200 --> 21:17.040
Yeah, especially when the price was so high.

21:17.040 --> 21:18.040
Right.

21:18.040 --> 21:19.620
The phone is a really cool idea.

21:19.620 --> 21:21.160
For anyone listening, I want to really drive that home.

21:21.160 --> 21:22.800
I'm not belittling the phone at all.

21:22.800 --> 21:27.680
I'm belittling how badly this campaign was done.

21:27.680 --> 21:32.260
It was absolutely done with the expectation that people are just going to be beating themselves

21:32.260 --> 21:34.800
over the head with their wads of money coming to the table.

21:34.800 --> 21:35.800
I suppose so.

21:35.800 --> 21:36.800
Give me a break.

21:36.800 --> 21:37.800
I suppose so.

21:37.800 --> 21:38.800
Yeah.

21:38.800 --> 21:41.880
I'm just being honest, and I think the phone's a cool idea.

21:41.880 --> 21:44.120
It was good enough for Stephen Fry, Matt.

21:44.120 --> 21:48.480
It should be good enough for – so they've raised – they've gotten – this morning

21:48.480 --> 21:50.440
when I was doing CoderRadio, they're at 11.4.

21:50.440 --> 21:54.320
Now they're 11.57 million, 57 hours remaining.

21:54.320 --> 21:58.140
I think one of the things I wanted to give some thought for by Sunday's Linux action

21:58.140 --> 22:02.120
show is what does this mean if it fails?

22:02.120 --> 22:04.560
What are the – I mean, we know what Canonical's going to say.

22:04.560 --> 22:08.720
Canonical's going to come out and say, even though it didn't reach funding, it is a success.

22:08.720 --> 22:09.920
We started the conversation.

22:09.920 --> 22:11.120
We moved the dialogue forward.

22:11.120 --> 22:12.400
We got people thinking.

22:12.400 --> 22:13.400
We dared.

22:13.400 --> 22:14.400
You are speak.

22:14.400 --> 22:15.400
Right.

22:15.400 --> 22:16.960
But that's what a company has to do, right?

22:16.960 --> 22:17.960
No.

22:17.960 --> 22:18.960
They don't have to.

22:18.960 --> 22:19.960
They choose to.

22:19.960 --> 22:20.960
I work with PR.

22:20.960 --> 22:21.960
It makes me cringe every time I hear it.

22:21.960 --> 22:22.960
No, I – I agree.

22:22.960 --> 22:23.960
I agree.

22:23.960 --> 22:24.960
I do agree.

22:24.960 --> 22:25.960
No, you're right.

22:25.960 --> 22:26.960
You're right.

22:26.960 --> 22:27.960
It does make me cringe, too, and I don't like it.

22:27.960 --> 22:30.080
It makes me roll my eyes, and it makes me think, gosh, that's why I like community

22:30.080 --> 22:31.080
banks.

22:31.080 --> 22:34.440
They're a great company with a great idea and a great phone, and I want to see them

22:34.440 --> 22:36.880
succeed, but they need to get off their pedestal.

22:36.880 --> 22:38.240
They're not Apple.

22:38.240 --> 22:42.840
People aren't going to just magically jump over there for the promise of air that you

22:42.840 --> 22:46.120
need to offer something upfront that gets these folks excited.

22:46.120 --> 22:51.120
If nothing more than to make them part of the build experience, even that would be something

22:51.120 --> 22:55.860
towards like we can't fly you out, but we can have private streaming – video streams.

22:55.860 --> 22:56.960
We can have private meetings.

22:56.960 --> 22:57.960
We can have – just include people.

22:57.960 --> 22:58.960
Got sessions.

22:58.960 --> 22:59.960
Yeah.

22:59.960 --> 23:00.960
Include people in the experience.

23:00.960 --> 23:04.360
Then at least they might actually get a rip because then they feel like they're part

23:04.360 --> 23:05.600
of this phone that's not here yet.

23:05.600 --> 23:06.600
That's all.

23:06.600 --> 23:07.600
I mean, just – it's so obvious.

23:07.600 --> 23:10.960
I just can't put together how they even figured that out.

23:10.960 --> 23:13.080
That makes me want to open beer number two, so I'm going to do it.

23:13.080 --> 23:14.080
Oh, my God.

23:14.080 --> 23:15.080
Yeah.

23:15.080 --> 23:16.080
All right.

23:16.080 --> 23:17.080
All right.

23:17.080 --> 23:18.080
Well, we'll ruminate on it.

23:18.080 --> 23:19.120
I want to talk about it more on Sunday.

23:19.120 --> 23:23.720
If you guys want to call in to Jupiter Broadcasting on Skype and share your thoughts on why Ubuntu

23:23.720 --> 23:27.120
Edge is – or maybe you still think it could have a shot, I'd love to hear that.

23:27.120 --> 23:28.240
I'd love to hear that argument.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.240
I really would.

23:29.240 --> 23:30.240
Oh, yeah.

23:30.240 --> 23:31.240
Totally.

23:31.240 --> 23:32.660
I would love to hear some theories on it for sure.

23:32.660 --> 23:36.920
We talked a little bit this morning on Coder Radio – we talked about two things.

23:36.920 --> 23:41.760
The second thing we talked about was the Ubuntu Edge stuff, kind of from a developer's perspective.

23:41.760 --> 23:45.760
I'm drinking a Heineken, by the way, the chat room ass, and before you jump on me,

23:45.760 --> 23:48.640
the wife brought me home a couple cases, and I'm not going to begrudge her for bringing

23:48.640 --> 23:49.640
me home beer.

23:49.640 --> 23:50.640
Hey.

23:50.640 --> 23:51.640
Anyone bringing you a Heine?

23:51.640 --> 23:52.640
I use a popular beer.

23:52.640 --> 23:53.640
Yeah.

23:53.640 --> 23:57.200
The first thing we talked about – this is kind of cool, Matt – is you know how – on

23:57.200 --> 24:01.600
Coder Radio – you know how Facebook has Facebook Connect and Google, you can authenticate

24:01.600 --> 24:03.520
to stuff using your Google account and Twitter.

24:03.520 --> 24:04.520
Right.

24:04.520 --> 24:05.520
Yeah.

24:05.520 --> 24:06.520
Oh, we got a call.

24:06.520 --> 24:07.520
Oh, let's see who's calling in.

24:07.520 --> 24:08.520
HR is calling.

24:08.520 --> 24:09.520
All right.

24:09.520 --> 24:10.520
Well, I'll finish my thought after we talk to HR.

24:10.520 --> 24:11.520
All righty.

24:11.520 --> 24:12.520
Hey, HR.

24:12.520 --> 24:13.520
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, man.

24:13.520 --> 24:14.520
Hi.

24:14.520 --> 24:15.520
Hi.

24:15.520 --> 24:18.080
So are you calling in to talk about Ubuntu Edge?

24:18.080 --> 24:19.080
Yeah.

24:19.080 --> 24:20.080
Sorry.

24:20.080 --> 24:21.080
My feed's got –

24:21.080 --> 24:22.080
Oh, yeah.

24:22.080 --> 24:24.840
Caller, you have to mute your radio when you call into the –

24:24.840 --> 24:25.840
Yeah.

24:25.840 --> 24:26.840
Otherwise, it's going to be a mess.

24:26.840 --> 24:27.840
Yeah.

24:27.840 --> 24:28.840
Yeah.

24:28.840 --> 24:31.040
It's like good old-fashioned radio call-in shows where people call in and they're in

24:31.040 --> 24:34.240
the car and they have their radio on in the car and then the radio host is like, Caller,

24:34.240 --> 24:35.240
turn down your radio.

24:35.240 --> 24:36.240
It's the same thing here on the show.

24:36.240 --> 24:37.240
Yeah.

24:37.240 --> 24:38.240
Yeah.

24:38.240 --> 24:42.440
You know, what I was talking about was between live feed and Skype, there's like a major

24:42.440 --> 24:43.440
difference for me.

24:43.440 --> 24:44.440
Yeah.

24:44.440 --> 24:45.440
Yeah.

24:45.440 --> 24:52.160
Well, something that kind of like got my attention about the whole Ubuntu phone thing was the

24:52.160 --> 24:59.520
fact that everything they wanted to use and were saying they were going to use was like

24:59.520 --> 25:01.920
stupid high-end.

25:01.920 --> 25:03.880
You didn't believe it possible?

25:03.880 --> 25:04.880
Yeah.

25:04.880 --> 25:12.600
And it's like the pricing for just the specs of the phones or the phone by itself, you'd

25:12.600 --> 25:18.040
be able to – you'd most likely be able to afford, I don't know, two or three iPhones.

25:18.040 --> 25:19.040
Exactly.

25:19.040 --> 25:21.040
On contract, though.

25:21.040 --> 25:22.040
On contract.

25:22.040 --> 25:23.040
Not on contract.

25:23.040 --> 25:24.040
Yeah.

25:24.040 --> 25:25.040
Yeah.

25:25.040 --> 25:26.040
Yeah.

25:26.040 --> 25:27.040
On contract.

25:27.040 --> 25:31.320
The manufacturing cost alone for these phones would be just like stupid.

25:31.320 --> 25:38.160
I mean, they could go with lower – like not lower crappy end, pardon the language,

25:38.160 --> 25:41.800
but like not as nice.

25:41.800 --> 25:44.720
Like what was the glass again, ruby glass or whatever it was?

25:44.720 --> 25:46.280
Sapphire glass, metal case.

25:46.280 --> 25:47.280
Sapphire glass.

25:47.280 --> 25:48.280
Yeah.

25:48.280 --> 25:49.280
Yeah.

25:49.280 --> 25:51.720
Well, maybe even using the Firefox phone as an example of that because I think you nailed

25:51.720 --> 25:55.200
a point because the Firefox phone, they have phones available now on eBay and they're

25:55.200 --> 25:56.200
lower-end phones.

25:56.200 --> 25:57.200
Yeah.

25:57.200 --> 25:58.200
Yeah.

25:58.200 --> 26:01.080
Yeah, but if you're asking people to shell out 700 bones, I think you've got to make

26:01.080 --> 26:02.080
it a high-end device.

26:02.080 --> 26:03.080
I think it's got to be premium.

26:03.080 --> 26:11.340
Well, then again, if the device was being made out of such high-end quality material,

26:11.340 --> 26:16.400
you wouldn't be asking them to shell out $700.

26:16.400 --> 26:17.800
You think it'd be more.

26:17.800 --> 26:18.800
I think you're probably right.

26:18.800 --> 26:19.800
It'd probably be less.

26:19.800 --> 26:21.360
I don't know.

26:21.360 --> 26:26.040
I think when you're doing limited runs, I think it could be $700, $800 a unit.

26:26.040 --> 26:27.040
I really do.

26:27.040 --> 26:28.040
Yeah.

26:28.040 --> 26:32.480
In fact, I think Mark, I think Shuttleworth alluded to that when he said, the reason why

26:32.480 --> 26:36.600
I'm not going to close the funding gap on this is because I expect this to overrun on

26:36.600 --> 26:38.800
costs and I'm going to have to cover that cost.

26:38.800 --> 26:43.440
So he's expecting it to be more than what it is.

26:43.440 --> 26:48.480
What you'd probably have HR, I bet, is instead of... You'd probably have a slightly slower

26:48.480 --> 26:52.960
CPU, or maybe a lower-class storage or something like that.

26:52.960 --> 26:55.280
They might have to cut in that area.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.280
Yeah.

26:56.280 --> 26:58.280
Well, good thoughts, man.

26:58.280 --> 26:59.920
Comes with a floppy disk or something.

26:59.920 --> 27:00.920
All right, dude.

27:00.920 --> 27:01.920
Well, thanks for calling in.

27:01.920 --> 27:02.920
All right, cool.

27:02.920 --> 27:03.920
Thanks.

27:03.920 --> 27:04.920
Have a good one.

27:04.920 --> 27:06.400
And that opens up the line, folks, if you want to call in.

27:06.400 --> 27:10.760
But good thoughts on... I do kind of... I see his point to a degree.

27:10.760 --> 27:15.520
I think you mentioned they're not Apple and they can't expect people to jump like Apple

27:15.520 --> 27:16.760
gets people to jump.

27:16.760 --> 27:22.500
And I'd argue, to some degree, Apple has sort of channeled this amazing marketing machine

27:22.500 --> 27:24.500
with this rabid fanboyism.

27:24.500 --> 27:28.000
But the other thing that Apple does is, when they're up there on stage and they say, boom,

27:28.000 --> 27:29.200
this is the iPhone 5.

27:29.200 --> 27:30.360
It's available next Friday.

27:30.360 --> 27:31.880
Yeah, it's in his hand.

27:31.880 --> 27:32.880
He's not holding a shell.

27:32.880 --> 27:33.880
You know what I mean?

27:33.880 --> 27:34.880
Yeah.

27:34.880 --> 27:37.600
And then the press, they get up and they go into this little room and they get handled

27:37.600 --> 27:40.080
in there where they get to get shown the new toy.

27:40.080 --> 27:46.280
And it's this... Everybody buys it because you're going to get it in four or five days.

27:46.280 --> 27:49.320
You're going to get it in seven days, worst case, maybe 14 days.

27:49.320 --> 27:50.520
So it's not a year away.

27:50.520 --> 27:51.520
Right.

27:51.520 --> 27:53.720
I mean, and see, that's exactly it.

27:53.720 --> 27:56.080
Because at the end of the day, I'm going to get up on stage, I'm going to have a shell

27:56.080 --> 27:57.080
in my hand.

27:57.080 --> 27:58.080
I'm going to tell you how cool it is.

27:58.080 --> 28:00.800
If everything goes well, maybe, kind of, sort of, you'll get it in a year.

28:00.800 --> 28:04.800
Hey, by the way, I'm going to secure $600 or $700 probably on your debit card because

28:04.800 --> 28:06.920
a lot of folks are using debit versus credit.

28:06.920 --> 28:09.820
All these things that pile up against them.

28:09.820 --> 28:14.080
And on top of the fact that, oh, hey, by the way, our ecosystem's completely new and unproven,

28:14.080 --> 28:15.600
but don't be worried about that.

28:15.600 --> 28:16.600
Really excited.

28:16.600 --> 28:17.600
Yeah.

28:17.600 --> 28:18.600
It's like, come on, guys.

28:18.600 --> 28:20.560
I mean, it's a great idea, but wake up.

28:20.560 --> 28:21.560
Geez.

28:21.560 --> 28:22.560
Oh, geez.

28:22.560 --> 28:25.760
Hate to be a buzzkill, but, I mean, I was really excited to see this come about.

28:25.760 --> 28:26.760
I think it's cool.

28:26.760 --> 28:29.400
I'm excited for the, yeah, you know, Firefox phone, too.

28:29.400 --> 28:31.760
But it's just disappointing because it was so mishandled.

28:31.760 --> 28:33.240
That's where my frustration is.

28:33.240 --> 28:34.240
Yeah.

28:34.240 --> 28:35.240
So.

28:35.240 --> 28:36.240
So, all right.

28:36.240 --> 28:37.240
I think I guess we'll move on.

28:37.240 --> 28:41.600
I was just going to mention in Coderadio this morning, we talked with a guy named Dan at

28:41.600 --> 28:47.360
the Mozilla project, and he's working on Persona, which is their authentication system to compete

28:47.360 --> 28:53.400
with Google Authenticator and, or not the two-factor app, but like Google Connect and

28:53.400 --> 28:54.400
Facebook Connect.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.400
It was a good chat.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.400
It was a good chat.

28:56.400 --> 29:00.120
And they're working on like a vendor neutral sort of open standardized login system.

29:00.120 --> 29:01.600
I was really impressed by it.

29:01.600 --> 29:05.000
That'd be really nice because honestly, logging into anything with Facebook and whatnot scares

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
the hell out of me.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
So.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
Yeah.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
Yeah.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
It always is weird because you don't know what kind of information they're getting.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
No.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
It's like.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
Is it a token or is it my entire profile?

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
Exactly.

29:14.000 --> 29:18.360
You know, I'm about to go and maybe check something out is will they suddenly decide

29:18.360 --> 29:20.880
to change their policy one day and all of a sudden it's appearing in my wall.

29:20.880 --> 29:21.880
Yeah, exactly.

29:21.880 --> 29:22.880
Yeah.

29:22.880 --> 29:23.880
All right.

29:23.880 --> 29:24.880
All right, Matt.

29:24.880 --> 29:25.880
Well, now we got Corey calling in.

29:25.880 --> 29:26.880
Hey, Corey.

29:26.880 --> 29:27.880
All right.

29:27.880 --> 29:28.880
Hey.

29:28.880 --> 29:29.880
Hey, man.

29:29.880 --> 29:30.880
What's going on?

29:30.880 --> 29:31.880
What's on your mind?

29:31.880 --> 29:32.880
I'm going to continue with the Ubuntu Edge.

29:32.880 --> 29:33.880
Do it.

29:33.880 --> 29:34.880
Yeah.

29:34.880 --> 29:36.880
Well, you know, with the price, I understand that the price is really high, but if they

29:36.880 --> 29:45.400
really want to get the niche of the the people that want to have that high end phone.

29:45.400 --> 29:46.400
Yeah.

29:46.400 --> 29:47.400
I feel like I agree.

29:47.400 --> 29:51.880
Like I think like metal, glass, this is all these are all high end components.

29:51.880 --> 29:55.480
I think that's one of the dings against the Samsung Galaxy S4 right now in reviews is

29:55.480 --> 29:59.880
that compared to the HTC One, it feels a little cheap because it's plasticky.

29:59.880 --> 30:00.880
Right.

30:00.880 --> 30:01.880
Yeah.

30:01.880 --> 30:09.480
I think the high end component was a good one, but so you think price wise, non-issue

30:09.480 --> 30:12.680
or do you still think it was a barrier for this thing to succeed?

30:12.680 --> 30:20.560
Well, I understand that the price wise, it probably is a bit of a barrier with this thing

30:20.560 --> 30:24.560
succeeding because people aren't used to paying this much for a phone.

30:24.560 --> 30:25.560
Right.

30:25.560 --> 30:32.720
People aren't used to having to shout out quite almost $700 just to get a phone, but

30:32.720 --> 30:37.640
you know, I've got the Indiegogo page up right now and I'm looking at it, you know, four

30:37.640 --> 30:43.800
gig of RAM, 128 gig, how many phones do you know with 128 gig of internal storage or four

30:43.800 --> 30:44.800
gig of RAM?

30:44.800 --> 30:45.800
I don't know of any.

30:45.800 --> 30:47.880
I mean, there might be one, but I don't know any of it.

30:47.880 --> 30:51.280
But maybe in a year that might not be the same.

30:51.280 --> 30:52.280
I mean, yeah.

30:52.280 --> 30:56.300
Because they are building this thing for a year from now and they got to be competitive

30:56.300 --> 30:58.040
what's on the market in a year.

30:58.040 --> 31:04.200
But I think even then, I think it could still be a competitive device or even comparatively.

31:04.200 --> 31:05.480
It's still going to be competitive.

31:05.480 --> 31:10.400
How many of them do you think are really going to also function as a desktop if you so choose

31:10.400 --> 31:11.400
to use it that way?

31:11.400 --> 31:12.400
Right.

31:12.400 --> 31:13.400
How do we know that really works though?

31:13.400 --> 31:19.840
I mean, at this point in time, so we've seen, what we've seen demoed is dude takes a phone,

31:19.840 --> 31:24.680
dude puts it in a dock, dude opens up a program, but that's not convergence.

31:24.680 --> 31:28.640
I can run two environments and with one's large screen, I start that environment and

31:28.640 --> 31:32.000
if one's small screen, I start that environment.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
That's desktop switching.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.120
That's not convergence.

31:34.120 --> 31:42.000
Convergence is I'm in an instant message with Matt about an app on my couch and then Matt

31:42.000 --> 31:46.920
sends me a link and I decide I want to open it up on my desktop and I dock my phone and

31:46.920 --> 31:52.720
that same instant message conversation moves into an application or is available to an

31:52.720 --> 31:56.760
application that is formatted for the desktop and if I click the link, it launches my desktop

31:56.760 --> 31:57.760
web browser.

31:57.760 --> 32:01.040
But if I kept the phone in my hand and clicked the link, it would launch the mobile browser.

32:01.040 --> 32:02.640
That to me is true convergence.

32:02.640 --> 32:05.500
I don't think we've ever seen anything like that demonstrated.

32:05.500 --> 32:08.720
What we've seen is you can put in a dock and you can use it and if you store all your stuff

32:08.720 --> 32:11.720
on the same file system, you can probably get to it, but I'm not actually even sure

32:11.720 --> 32:13.520
that that's how that works.

32:13.520 --> 32:15.480
Yeah, I suppose.

32:15.480 --> 32:17.160
Well, and I have one thought.

32:17.160 --> 32:22.000
Now, the closest I've ever seen to that personally and that's certainly not there, but it's way

32:22.000 --> 32:25.400
closer than anything Ubuntu's got, Airdroid.

32:25.400 --> 32:29.280
I pretty much can go back and forth with messages.

32:29.280 --> 32:32.280
I can access applications to back them up or whatnot.

32:32.280 --> 32:33.280
I can browse the web.

32:33.280 --> 32:35.200
I can do a lot of my battery status, whatnot.

32:35.200 --> 32:37.760
I can do that with Airdroid and it's done without a dock.

32:37.760 --> 32:39.400
See for me, the dock is a real hindrance.

32:39.400 --> 32:40.720
I don't care for that at all.

32:40.720 --> 32:45.800
In that post I was reading from Crash Bandicoot, he says that convergence is an answer to a

32:45.800 --> 32:46.800
problem that doesn't exist.

32:46.800 --> 32:53.920
I don't know if I totally agree, but I think Cory and I would love to have a really... You

32:53.920 --> 32:57.960
think about five years from now, these phones are so freaking powerful, it's stupid, right?

32:57.960 --> 32:59.480
You might as well do something with all of that.

32:59.480 --> 33:01.400
Why not use it as a desktop?

33:01.400 --> 33:02.400
Sure.

33:02.400 --> 33:04.320
I think it's a good idea, but not with a dock.

33:04.320 --> 33:07.440
I think it needs to be over the air and it's not like the technology doesn't exist.

33:07.440 --> 33:10.240
It has for quite a while now.

33:10.240 --> 33:11.240
Just use it.

33:11.240 --> 33:12.240
Yeah.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.360
I suppose over the air would probably be a lot better.

33:14.360 --> 33:18.000
It's just more convenient really than... I'd better put it in the dock.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
Yeah.

33:19.000 --> 33:23.640
It's like, hey, let me get my Palm Pilot out and I'm going to have it dial in and I'm going

33:23.640 --> 33:25.600
to check the enterprise server.

33:25.600 --> 33:27.720
Make sure you've got your Comport enabled there, Matt.

33:27.720 --> 33:28.720
Right.

33:28.720 --> 33:32.480
It's just like, what a buzzkill, but the phone itself is a cool idea.

33:32.480 --> 33:33.480
I'm excited about the phone.

33:33.480 --> 33:38.800
Well, I was excited about the phone, but I feel like that... I think you're right on

33:38.800 --> 33:39.800
the specs.

33:39.800 --> 33:43.480
Everyone high on specs, but I think people would rather take that same $600 or $700 and

33:43.480 --> 33:47.760
just go buy a really nice Android phone with the ecosystem that they can get today or tomorrow

33:47.760 --> 33:48.760
or even in a few weeks.

33:48.760 --> 33:53.560
Well, what I don't understand, and not to take too much from our conversation on Sunday,

33:53.560 --> 33:59.120
but what I don't understand is to me, it seems more capable and more likely to do some sort

33:59.120 --> 34:02.160
of middleman convergence using a tablet.

34:02.160 --> 34:05.180
First of all, tablet space is pretty competitive.

34:05.180 --> 34:08.720
It seems a little less locked down to me than the phone space does.

34:08.720 --> 34:10.960
Everybody's got a phone already, right?

34:10.960 --> 34:17.160
Nobody really... At this point, anybody who has the scratch to back that Indiegogo campaign,

34:17.160 --> 34:19.480
there's none of those people don't already have a phone.

34:19.480 --> 34:23.080
Those two things don't exist in this universe, but they might have a little room for a new

34:23.080 --> 34:24.080
tablet.

34:24.080 --> 34:25.080
Not only that-

34:25.080 --> 34:26.080
I don't have a tablet.

34:26.080 --> 34:27.080
Right, right.

34:27.080 --> 34:28.080
Yeah.

34:28.080 --> 34:29.080
And you're not married to the tablet like you are the phone.

34:29.080 --> 34:33.160
I mean, you're married to the phone, and a tablet could also be its own display, so you

34:33.160 --> 34:38.540
don't have to worry about this weird switch off, hand off between desktop and mobile applications.

34:38.540 --> 34:42.040
Maybe you just create some sort of dock that holds the tablet, and you have a USB mouse

34:42.040 --> 34:43.880
and keyboard hooked up to that all the time.

34:43.880 --> 34:45.160
The Note 2 does this.

34:45.160 --> 34:47.400
The Note 2 that Matt now has, has a dock.

34:47.400 --> 34:50.680
You put the Note 2 in a dock, you can have a USB mouse and keyboard, perma hooked up

34:50.680 --> 34:55.120
to that dock, and when you put the Note 2 in that dock, it becomes a device that works

34:55.120 --> 34:56.120
with a mouse and keyboard.

34:56.120 --> 34:57.120
That's right.

34:57.120 --> 34:58.120
And it's very cool.

34:58.120 --> 34:59.120
They could have done that with a Bluetooth Touch.

34:59.120 --> 35:02.200
I bet you... I don't know if it would have even been 32 million, because you don't have

35:02.200 --> 35:04.880
to worry about all of the cellular stuff, or nothing like that.

35:04.880 --> 35:06.480
You don't have to worry about this.

35:06.480 --> 35:09.960
You could even have gone a route of what Google does with the Nexus.

35:09.960 --> 35:10.960
Let's be honest.

35:10.960 --> 35:12.880
The Nexus isn't some custom built piece of hardware.

35:12.880 --> 35:16.920
It's made by Asus, and then Google takes it, and they OEM it.

35:16.920 --> 35:18.880
They could have totally done that.

35:18.880 --> 35:19.880
Right.

35:19.880 --> 35:20.880
They could have.

35:20.880 --> 35:21.880
Yeah.

35:21.880 --> 35:23.440
That's kind of my theory of it.

35:23.440 --> 35:26.720
There's so much they could have done, and I feel a little bit like they rushed into

35:26.720 --> 35:27.720
it.

35:27.720 --> 35:29.200
I like what you guys are saying about the tablet aspect.

35:29.200 --> 35:30.840
I think that would be an interesting approach.

35:30.840 --> 35:31.840
Maybe they still will.

35:31.840 --> 35:32.840
They are working.

35:32.840 --> 35:33.840
We've seen images on the Nexus.

35:33.840 --> 35:38.480
Well, and I guess when I take away from this, and all the Matt Hartley dramas pulled away

35:38.480 --> 35:42.900
from this whole experience, and we really look at this with practical eyes, the investment

35:42.900 --> 35:48.840
thus far has been figuratively minimal compared to had they actually invested millions of

35:48.840 --> 35:52.520
dollars in this, had it flopped, and then say, oh wow, we should have done a tablet.

35:52.520 --> 35:57.280
So once withdrawing my own drama from it, this may just have been a learning experience

35:57.280 --> 35:58.280
for them.

35:58.280 --> 35:59.280
If it is, then more power to them.

35:59.280 --> 36:00.280
I get excited about a tablet then.

36:00.280 --> 36:01.280
Cool.

36:01.280 --> 36:04.200
Any other thoughts before we let you go?

36:04.200 --> 36:10.240
Well, I suppose really it's kind of, currently it's just one of those things that gets in

36:10.240 --> 36:14.400
with the geekiness of people, you know, those ones that small niche, that idea that they

36:14.400 --> 36:19.720
could have this phone with four gig of RAM, and they can plug it in, and it'll just work

36:19.720 --> 36:21.680
on your Bantu desktop.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.560
And one that's meant to dual boot too.

36:23.560 --> 36:24.560
That's cool too.

36:24.560 --> 36:25.560
Oh yeah, definitely.

36:25.560 --> 36:26.560
Yeah, yeah.

36:26.560 --> 36:27.560
That's really cool.

36:27.560 --> 36:28.560
Yeah, I like that feature.

36:28.560 --> 36:32.320
So before I let you go, chat room is asking, they want a little more Luna talk.

36:32.320 --> 36:33.760
Have you tried out elementary OS?

36:33.760 --> 36:35.320
What do you think?

36:35.320 --> 36:39.240
I haven't tried it out yet, so I was thinking about trying it out later though.

36:39.240 --> 36:41.080
Have you watched our review on it yet?

36:41.080 --> 36:42.080
No.

36:42.080 --> 36:43.560
Oh yeah, I've watched reviews.

36:43.560 --> 36:48.680
All right, well I want you to try it out and then let us know what you think, okay?

36:48.680 --> 36:50.000
It's important to the chat room, Corey.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
It's important.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
All right, Corey, thanks for calling in, buddy.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
We'll talk to you later.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.480
All right, well that was good.

36:55.480 --> 36:56.560
Good thoughts on Corey's part.

36:56.560 --> 36:59.760
Thanks Corey for calling into the chat, appreciate it.

36:59.760 --> 37:00.760
All right, Matt.

37:00.760 --> 37:01.960
Well, we'll leave that line open.

37:01.960 --> 37:03.160
This is apparently a hot topic.

37:03.160 --> 37:07.360
You know, it's because it's about the, it's like time, right?

37:07.360 --> 37:08.360
It's time.

37:08.360 --> 37:09.360
It's really time.

37:09.360 --> 37:10.360
It's the last few hours.

37:10.360 --> 37:13.520
And I think a lot of people are passionate about it from one direction or another.

37:13.520 --> 37:16.720
They either are excited and want to see it happen.

37:16.720 --> 37:19.800
They're angry and they think of this as a mis-focus for Ubuntu and that they should

37:19.800 --> 37:21.160
concentrate on software.

37:21.160 --> 37:22.160
There's a lot of emotion.

37:22.160 --> 37:23.160
Yeah.

37:23.160 --> 37:24.160
I feel like that's me.

37:24.160 --> 37:30.600
Yeah, no, I'm kind of, you know, you know, I'm so detached from them these days that,

37:30.600 --> 37:32.720
you know, I want to see them do well, whatever they're doing.

37:32.720 --> 37:33.720
No, I hear you.

37:33.720 --> 37:34.720
All right.

37:34.720 --> 37:38.400
Well, before we get into some of the last feedback, I thought I'd cover an email that

37:38.400 --> 37:40.040
was feedback addressed to this show.

37:40.040 --> 37:41.040
Yeah.

37:41.040 --> 37:43.880
Ryan emailed us and he said, I've been watching last for a little over a year now and I just

37:43.880 --> 37:48.320
wanted to touch on Too Much Choice episode one that I just listened to about two hours

37:48.320 --> 37:49.320
ago.

37:49.320 --> 37:52.880
I'm very happy that you guys added Too Much Choice to the lineup or Linux unplugged as

37:52.880 --> 37:53.880
the case might be.

37:53.880 --> 37:56.400
I have a few thoughts regarding the Linux desktop frustrations.

37:56.400 --> 38:00.640
I find myself working with Unity because it works mostly out of the box and I don't have

38:00.640 --> 38:04.160
to deal with it crashing or audio not working randomly during the day.

38:04.160 --> 38:07.720
I would like to use KDE, but I truly don't have time to tweak and fix it.

38:07.720 --> 38:08.720
Hmm.

38:08.720 --> 38:11.240
You know, that's actually a fair point.

38:11.240 --> 38:14.160
I've found that to be generally true.

38:14.160 --> 38:18.800
I've certainly had my own issues with Unity from time to time, but you know, in its current

38:18.800 --> 38:20.600
state, it's not too bad.

38:20.600 --> 38:22.760
KDE, the new release is out.

38:22.760 --> 38:23.760
We'll try that.

38:23.760 --> 38:25.640
We've dealt with their audio stuff.

38:25.640 --> 38:31.040
It is definitely a desktop for those that like to tweak and to massage into their own

38:31.040 --> 38:32.040
needs.

38:32.040 --> 38:33.040
Yeah.

38:33.040 --> 38:35.000
Yeah, we got a lot of interesting feedback.

38:35.000 --> 38:39.080
A lot of folks are like, yeah, I have the same audio problems you guys do and then like

38:39.080 --> 38:41.240
a lot of folks are like, I've never had an audio problem, I don't know what the hell

38:41.240 --> 38:42.240
you're talking about.

38:42.240 --> 38:46.120
Well, someone in the chat room earlier commented, they said, well, you know, Skype for Linux

38:46.120 --> 38:50.840
is crap and a lot of that is in fact because of the whole Pulse Audio thing.

38:50.840 --> 38:55.260
I will go on record and saying this Skype call that I'm in right now for the show is

38:55.260 --> 38:58.200
on Ubuntu in Skype.

38:58.200 --> 38:59.200
It's fine.

38:59.200 --> 39:03.700
My CPU usage is, I can't even see it moving.

39:03.700 --> 39:06.040
It's the latest review and it's actually pretty good.

39:06.040 --> 39:07.840
So is audio okay?

39:07.840 --> 39:09.400
Eh, you know, it's not bad.

39:09.400 --> 39:11.000
It's not bad in Ubuntu.

39:11.000 --> 39:15.660
He goes on, he wants to know, he wants to know if we could share some of the sites we

39:15.660 --> 39:21.040
use on a daily basis to stay up to date on Linux and IT news happenings.

39:21.040 --> 39:24.440
He'd be curious to know what we do to kind of stay abreast of the news.

39:24.440 --> 39:27.480
Now, do you have any particular sites that you love to troll on a regular basis?

39:27.480 --> 39:28.680
Oh, goodness.

39:28.680 --> 39:31.560
A lot of what I try and make it work for me as much as possible.

39:31.560 --> 39:36.080
I do a lot of Linux.com or Linux Today because it does a lot of the curating for me, Tux

39:36.080 --> 39:37.980
machines.

39:37.980 --> 39:42.360
I have Google Watch watching for various keywords, things of that sort.

39:42.360 --> 39:47.000
I don't have any real specific brand loyalty to any real websites outside of Datamation

39:47.000 --> 39:49.760
where I will be writing for again here in a couple months.

39:49.760 --> 39:50.760
Nothing real specific.

39:50.760 --> 39:56.440
I used to check H Online pretty regularly, you know, but obviously that's not really

39:56.440 --> 39:57.880
an option anymore.

39:57.880 --> 40:03.920
Of course, the Linux Action Show subreddit is actually seriously one of the best resources.

40:03.920 --> 40:07.240
I also probably every day visit Linux Insider.

40:07.240 --> 40:09.120
Yeah, yeah, that's good.

40:09.120 --> 40:14.000
I visit there about once a week, I go to LWN.net.

40:14.000 --> 40:19.240
If I'm just browsing for headlines, Lexer, L-X-E-R.com is pretty good.

40:19.240 --> 40:23.160
OS Static blogs are good for a post here and there.

40:23.160 --> 40:28.040
Honestly, I know, you know, good old Michael Larbo over there at Phronix gets a hard time

40:28.040 --> 40:31.120
from time to time, but I try to check out Phronix once a day, see what they're up to.

40:31.120 --> 40:32.120
Yeah, I check out Phronix.

40:32.120 --> 40:36.360
I don't do Lexer just because we have a long angry personal history with Ferretti people

40:36.360 --> 40:37.360
there.

40:37.360 --> 40:38.360
Oh, really?

40:38.360 --> 40:39.360
Yeah.

40:39.360 --> 40:40.360
It was a long time ago.

40:40.360 --> 40:41.360
It was my fault.

40:41.360 --> 40:42.360
It's totally long, old history.

40:42.360 --> 40:43.360
I'm sure you guys could probably find out a lot there.

40:43.360 --> 40:47.200
If you need a website to be dead to the show, we can make a site dead to the show.

40:47.200 --> 40:50.880
By the way, Gawker is dead to Jupiter Broadcast News because I think they're a bunch of pricks.

40:50.880 --> 40:52.360
Oh, yeah, they totally are.

40:52.360 --> 40:58.800
No, Lexer is just, it's hyper Linux user, very, very passionate people that get angry

40:58.800 --> 40:59.800
real easy.

40:59.800 --> 41:00.800
Ooh.

41:00.800 --> 41:06.400
I also troll the Linux subreddit, which apparently is full of people who are super grumpy.

41:06.400 --> 41:07.400
Wow.

41:07.400 --> 41:09.400
You know, different strokes to different folks.

41:09.400 --> 41:11.520
Most of the people in the subreddit are super awesome.

41:11.520 --> 41:14.320
Every once in a while you get somebody with a stick up his backside, but that's okay.

41:14.320 --> 41:15.320
Yeah, yeah.

41:15.320 --> 41:16.320
That's okay.

41:16.320 --> 41:17.320
And you mentioned tuxmachines.org, I think.

41:17.320 --> 41:18.320
TuxMachines.

41:18.320 --> 41:19.320
TuxMachines is pretty cool.

41:19.320 --> 41:21.480
Linux today, any of the, you know, Phronix is good too.

41:21.480 --> 41:22.480
Yeah.

41:22.480 --> 41:23.480
The subreddit's a no question, obviously.

41:23.480 --> 41:27.320
Yeah, that is the best resource because if there's something good on pretty much any

41:27.320 --> 41:31.280
of those sites, it'll eventually show up in the subreddit and usually within a few minutes.

41:31.280 --> 41:32.280
It's pretty good.

41:32.280 --> 41:33.280
Exactly.

41:33.280 --> 41:34.280
Okay.

41:34.280 --> 41:35.280
Marlin wrote in, he said, hi, Chris and Matt.

41:35.280 --> 41:38.480
You both recently talked about too much choice in the Linux world and how this can be potentially

41:38.480 --> 41:40.480
get a little bit over your head.

41:40.480 --> 41:44.640
While I don't necessarily disagree per se, I think you failed to consider some implications

41:44.640 --> 41:45.640
of this.

41:45.640 --> 41:46.640
You've had some issues with KDE.

41:46.640 --> 41:47.700
Sorry to hear that.

41:47.700 --> 41:51.320
And basically said that OS X and Windows users don't have the same immature problems.

41:51.320 --> 41:55.900
However, I have to disagree because as someone who spends a lot of time troubleshooting Windows

41:55.900 --> 41:59.760
boxes for home users, I know for a fact that this is exactly the sort of problem Windows

41:59.760 --> 42:01.720
and OS X users face as well.

42:01.720 --> 42:05.720
Or because they cannot switch desktop, sound servers, et cetera, they usually don't complain

42:05.720 --> 42:09.320
about it as loudly as you do and because they don't have a podcast.

42:09.320 --> 42:12.360
The difference being that in Linux, you can at least attempt to fix these problems while

42:12.360 --> 42:15.960
Windows OS X, you're stuck with what the factory manufactured for you.

42:15.960 --> 42:16.960
Excellent.

42:16.960 --> 42:18.040
First of all, excellent feedback.

42:18.040 --> 42:19.840
I think that's, I think you made some valid points there.

42:19.840 --> 42:24.120
I used to be in PC repair myself and that's actually, it was Windows Vista that pushed

42:24.120 --> 42:25.840
me out of it completely.

42:25.840 --> 42:27.720
That was at that point I just stopped.

42:27.720 --> 42:29.920
And so, so I totally hear where you're coming from.

42:29.920 --> 42:36.280
I would disagree in saying that I don't believe I suggested that Windows didn't present frustration

42:36.280 --> 42:38.800
experiences because believe me, I feel your pain.

42:38.800 --> 42:42.560
They really do and I'm right there with you and being the guy that has to tell the person

42:42.560 --> 42:46.760
that it's not your fault, the tech, it's the fault of the operating system they're using.

42:46.760 --> 42:48.080
So I understand completely.

42:48.080 --> 42:51.160
Yeah, you know, I definitely feel where you're coming from.

42:51.160 --> 42:56.160
I don't think it's a matter of – I think the people that you're dealing with in those

42:56.160 --> 43:00.240
situations honestly don't know any differently where Linux users do.

43:00.240 --> 43:04.160
We have experienced different experiences and so we are in fact looking at it from a

43:04.160 --> 43:05.160
different perspective.

43:05.160 --> 43:12.840
I have, I would have as somebody, you know, who's used Linux in production on and off,

43:12.840 --> 43:19.880
I would say that audio subsystems have been more reliable, especially on OS X than on

43:19.880 --> 43:20.880
Linux.

43:20.880 --> 43:24.640
Windows, yeah, I mean Windows, it's always comes down to how good the driver is.

43:24.640 --> 43:26.000
It's always about the driver on Windows.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.920
If the driver is shite, then the application compatibility is going to be shite.

43:29.920 --> 43:33.200
And you know, he goes on to say, he says, PS, I've never had a sound issue in KDE and

43:33.200 --> 43:38.360
I'm running three sound cards on a desktop with one of them being a USB DAC and an amp,

43:38.360 --> 43:40.840
but it may be worthwhile looking at text configs.

43:40.840 --> 43:45.200
So you know, in my setup, I've got three sound options.

43:45.200 --> 43:49.320
One of them is a USB M-Audio adapter.

43:49.320 --> 43:54.120
You know, and sometimes the issue for me is that KDE just doesn't see the device.

43:54.120 --> 43:55.600
It just does not show up.

43:55.600 --> 43:57.160
If I log into GNOME, it's there.

43:57.160 --> 43:58.240
Well, and that's just it.

43:58.240 --> 44:01.000
I will literally have not touched USB heads.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.280
Everything's left as it was the day before.

44:02.280 --> 44:06.040
I will boot up and it's saying, oh, hey, such and such sound card.

44:06.040 --> 44:07.040
It's not there anymore.

44:07.040 --> 44:08.040
What do you want to do about that?

44:08.040 --> 44:09.040
Do you want to ignore it?

44:09.040 --> 44:10.040
Wait, what?

44:10.040 --> 44:13.860
You know, that's not something that, that's where our frustration comes from.

44:13.860 --> 44:18.880
And so in a Windows experience or an OS X experience, usually you don't get the nag

44:18.880 --> 44:19.920
in Windows or OS X.

44:19.920 --> 44:20.920
It just won't work.

44:20.920 --> 44:25.800
And then of course the casual user just says, oh, well, I'll just call my tech.

44:25.800 --> 44:29.080
Linux users are a hands-on crowd where they're thinking, oh, well, I need to massage this

44:29.080 --> 44:30.200
and figure out why it's not working.

44:30.200 --> 44:31.600
Plus I'm seeing a nag about it.

44:31.600 --> 44:34.480
So that's usually the difference, I guess.

44:34.480 --> 44:35.480
I think-

44:35.480 --> 44:37.280
But great feedback though.

44:37.280 --> 44:38.280
Yeah.

44:38.280 --> 44:39.280
I think it's worth considering that.

44:39.280 --> 44:42.520
And I'm willing to kind of, you know, I'm kind of willing to monkey around with my setup

44:42.520 --> 44:44.120
to see if maybe I'm just doing something wrong.

44:44.120 --> 44:45.760
I'm willing to accept the possibility, Matt.

44:45.760 --> 44:47.200
I can accept it.

44:47.200 --> 44:50.760
I just want to refer people, and I'll try to remember to link to this.

44:50.760 --> 44:51.760
You know what?

44:51.760 --> 44:54.480
I got some notes I've started right here for the show notes.

44:54.480 --> 45:02.400
Ooh, in the subreddit said, he started a thread called, I don't know, this is so great as

45:02.400 --> 45:05.400
a long-time Linux user, Linux games.

45:05.400 --> 45:06.400
Before it was cool.

45:06.400 --> 45:08.840
You know, it's like games before we had actual games, and I don't mean-

45:08.840 --> 45:09.840
Oh yeah.

45:09.840 --> 45:10.840
I remember those days.

45:10.840 --> 45:11.840
He says, I'm a gamer.

45:11.840 --> 45:12.840
I like games.

45:12.840 --> 45:13.840
It's great that we have Steam now.

45:13.840 --> 45:15.480
And most indie games are announcing Linux support.

45:15.480 --> 45:18.160
And we've even seen some AAA stuff.

45:18.160 --> 45:21.000
Like how cool was that space game I showed in last on Sunday?

45:21.000 --> 45:22.000
That was awesome.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
That was really awesome.

45:23.000 --> 45:31.120
Like I realized like Linux has gotten to the point now where I'm checking what new games

45:31.120 --> 45:35.200
are in Steam on a weekly basis, and I'm getting one or two a week.

45:35.200 --> 45:36.200
Oh yeah.

45:36.200 --> 45:37.520
Maybe one a week.

45:37.520 --> 45:38.520
This is amazing, Matt.

45:38.520 --> 45:46.400
I mean, this is, I'm getting one or two new video games from Steam a week for Linux.

45:46.400 --> 45:49.880
And I remember like it was a big deal because we had Unreal Tournament and Postal.

45:49.880 --> 45:50.880
Yes!

45:50.880 --> 45:51.880
Yes!

45:51.880 --> 45:53.440
And you know, and Postal, I mean, come on, who hasn't played Postal?

45:53.440 --> 45:54.440
I mean, everybody likes to be-

45:54.440 --> 45:58.320
Remember how appreciative we are when Unreal Tournament 2004 came out for Linux?

45:58.320 --> 45:59.320
And we were like, thank you.

45:59.320 --> 46:00.320
Oh, I get a jig.

46:00.320 --> 46:01.320
Thank you.

46:01.320 --> 46:02.320
Yeah.

46:02.320 --> 46:03.680
That was the only game I played.

46:03.680 --> 46:06.360
I ignored a Windows partition completely because of that.

46:06.360 --> 46:07.360
Yeah.

46:07.360 --> 46:08.360
It was so funny.

46:08.360 --> 46:09.360
Yeah.

46:09.360 --> 46:12.120
And I just, I just wanted to, I just want to take a minute, ooh, whose post in the subreddit

46:12.120 --> 46:13.120
made me think about that.

46:13.120 --> 46:17.560
And I just thought, I got to reflect on this, on, on how we've had such a fundamental shift

46:17.560 --> 46:18.560
now.

46:18.560 --> 46:20.960
And you know, really good games in Steam.

46:20.960 --> 46:23.000
Very excited.

46:23.000 --> 46:27.280
And I, I don't believe this shuts out the open source games at all.

46:27.280 --> 46:30.880
I think this sort of lights a fire and I think we're going to see a new generation of open

46:30.880 --> 46:32.360
source games coming soon.

46:32.360 --> 46:37.720
Anyways, in his subreddit post, he linked to NetHack and Hedge Wars, Broken Sword, bunch

46:37.720 --> 46:38.720
of really good old games.

46:38.720 --> 46:41.720
So if you guys want to get your retro game, he's got an Android alpha build for a couple

46:41.720 --> 46:42.720
of these.

46:42.720 --> 46:43.720
He's got a lot of retro gaming on.

46:43.720 --> 46:46.760
I'll try to remember to put all, in fact, I just closed it before I got the link.

46:46.760 --> 46:47.920
I'll put the link right now.

46:47.920 --> 46:50.960
I'm writing it down for my notes so that way you guys can go check that out if you want

46:50.960 --> 46:51.960
to go get your nostalgia.

46:51.960 --> 46:52.960
Why not?

46:52.960 --> 46:53.960
Right?

46:53.960 --> 46:54.960
Good times.

46:54.960 --> 46:55.960
Good times.

46:55.960 --> 46:56.960
All right.

46:56.960 --> 46:57.960
I'm going to read another email.

46:57.960 --> 47:01.200
This one is sent in from Ian and it's on the topic of mail servers.

47:01.200 --> 47:02.800
You know, that's been a hot topic of mine recently.

47:02.800 --> 47:03.800
Oh man.

47:03.800 --> 47:04.800
It's been burning up the subreddit.

47:04.800 --> 47:08.640
It says, dear Matt and Chris, I just watched the first episode of Linux action show unplugged.

47:08.640 --> 47:11.120
He called it untangled, which is pretty good.

47:11.120 --> 47:12.120
That's pretty good.

47:12.120 --> 47:16.120
If we would have had like the, you know, like back in, back in the day of old time radio,

47:16.120 --> 47:20.520
you'd have like one sponsor that was like the beneficiary sponsor of your entire show.

47:20.520 --> 47:22.040
You'd even name the show after that sponsor.

47:22.040 --> 47:25.280
In some cases, if untangle was that for unplugged, we could have done that.

47:25.280 --> 47:26.280
That would totally work.

47:26.280 --> 47:27.280
Yeah.

47:27.280 --> 47:28.280
Radio theater.

47:28.280 --> 47:29.280
Yeah.

47:29.280 --> 47:30.280
Theater of the mind, Matt.

47:30.280 --> 47:31.720
He said he found it very informative, interesting.

47:31.720 --> 47:35.840
And he said, since we asked about different setups of mail servers of the viewers, he

47:35.840 --> 47:40.400
decided to send an email from his own mail server, which he does not keep up 24 seven,

47:40.400 --> 47:41.400
by the way.

47:41.400 --> 47:42.400
He does that.

47:42.400 --> 47:46.560
I just recently switched from Ubuntu to arch and I found arch to be a great distribution.

47:46.560 --> 47:51.440
I tried to set up a mail server for my family with courier MTA, which is an IMAP and SMTP

47:51.440 --> 47:54.240
solution rolled into one application, right?

47:54.240 --> 47:58.160
There was an excellent wiki page on the arch wiki, but I was not able to get relays working

47:58.160 --> 47:59.160
correctly.

47:59.160 --> 48:02.120
So I switched to post fix for SMTP and courier IMAP for IMAP.

48:02.120 --> 48:06.080
The combination has been working wonderfully and I use the tutorial and he links me to

48:06.080 --> 48:15.960
a tutorial on a hyper X dot or a hyper X or H Y P E X R dot org with a few modifications

48:15.960 --> 48:16.960
to be able to set it up.

48:16.960 --> 48:18.760
I checked out the tutorial actually looked pretty good.

48:18.760 --> 48:22.100
I also decided to set up a web mail system with PHP and Apache.

48:22.100 --> 48:27.240
He used a after a logic web mail light as his web mail package because it was easy to

48:27.240 --> 48:30.160
configure and has a nice and easy to use interface.

48:30.160 --> 48:33.880
And because of course it's open source under the GPL three, I love that.

48:33.880 --> 48:36.360
So good to see, see that happening.

48:36.360 --> 48:37.880
Second email came in here to the show.

48:37.880 --> 48:44.600
This one came from Demetrius, Demetrius, Doritos, he says, hi Chris and Matt on last season

48:44.600 --> 48:50.000
28 episode three and on Linux action show and plugs you spoke about remote desktop solutions.

48:50.000 --> 48:55.440
For years I've been using multi-user remote desktop based on NX called no machine.

48:55.440 --> 48:59.920
It's easy to set up runs over the SSH port and it's very customizable and best of all

48:59.920 --> 49:05.040
it behaves like a terminal server in windows in the multiple users can be logged into their

49:05.040 --> 49:08.480
own desktop over RDP at the same time.

49:08.480 --> 49:11.760
It's very customizable, very customizable and scales well.

49:11.760 --> 49:13.320
He says, by the way, congrats on the new edition.

49:13.320 --> 49:16.880
My hat's off to you for being able to not only run the network, but also get some salt

49:16.880 --> 49:22.420
and but on probably what I assume is only two to three hours of sleep.

49:22.420 --> 49:23.560
He's right about that.

49:23.560 --> 49:29.200
So no machine and NX, talked about it a while ago.

49:29.200 --> 49:30.200
Have you familiar?

49:30.200 --> 49:31.200
Have you seen it?

49:31.200 --> 49:32.200
I have.

49:32.200 --> 49:33.880
It's been so long since I played with it.

49:33.880 --> 49:39.120
It's one of those things that where it's powerful, but it's not exactly like team viewer.

49:39.120 --> 49:40.120
You know what I mean?

49:40.120 --> 49:41.200
You're not going to walk into it and get it working.

49:41.200 --> 49:44.220
You actually have to, there is some minor configuration involved.

49:44.220 --> 49:45.600
So I think it has its place.

49:45.600 --> 49:50.920
I think I certainly think it has its place with anyone that's experienced with such things.

49:50.920 --> 49:54.560
It's not for everybody and I think it's something that each individual would have to try to

49:54.560 --> 49:57.240
decide whether or not it's a match for them, but it is very cool and very powerful.

49:57.240 --> 49:58.240
I'll give it that.

49:58.240 --> 49:59.360
Yeah, I have.

49:59.360 --> 50:03.200
I have used it and it is amazing.

50:03.200 --> 50:04.200
It is.

50:04.200 --> 50:05.200
The performance is incredible.

50:05.200 --> 50:09.360
I had a machine set up in Texas out remote into that machine and I would work out of

50:09.360 --> 50:12.600
that machine all day long.

50:12.600 --> 50:13.800
I could watch videos.

50:13.800 --> 50:18.040
I'm talking YouTube videos, everything through this remote connection through NX.

50:18.040 --> 50:19.640
It is incredible.

50:19.640 --> 50:24.000
However, Splashtop is a little better for like that remote desktop solution where you

50:24.000 --> 50:29.640
actually, and this was key, need to get the console that is up on the screen because I

50:29.640 --> 50:35.520
will start an application in the studio right there in NX, I'll launch Handbrake and then

50:35.520 --> 50:39.560
I'll walk away and go make dinner and I want to be able to just fire up on my tablet or

50:39.560 --> 50:43.360
go into my home office and just pull up the studio machine and just see where Handbrake's

50:43.360 --> 50:44.360
at.

50:44.360 --> 50:45.360
Exactly.

50:45.360 --> 50:46.360
Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

50:46.360 --> 50:49.420
And I know that I felt so bad for a few people that have had struggles getting it to work

50:49.420 --> 50:50.420
in Arch.

50:50.420 --> 50:55.400
I didn't have that hard a time with it, but I know folks that legitimately have.

50:55.400 --> 50:59.920
But at the same time, it's just so fast and so easy to use and I can use it on my phone.

50:59.920 --> 51:01.200
I can use it on another desktop.

51:01.200 --> 51:02.720
I can use it from anywhere in the world.

51:02.720 --> 51:05.240
It's just brain dead simple to use once you get it installed.

51:05.240 --> 51:06.240
It really is.

51:06.240 --> 51:09.940
And I could see what Arm's saying in the chat room where TeamViewer is a little more available

51:09.940 --> 51:11.160
for other distributions.

51:11.160 --> 51:12.160
It totally is.

51:12.160 --> 51:17.440
And I use TeamViewer actually on another desktop and the performance is also good.

51:17.440 --> 51:19.120
And I love TeamViewer and I want to be clear on that.

51:19.120 --> 51:23.460
I'm a user, but the performance is not even remotely as good as Splashtop.

51:23.460 --> 51:25.360
And I'm going to say that as a TeamViewer fan.

51:25.360 --> 51:26.360
I like them.

51:26.360 --> 51:27.360
I think they're great.

51:27.360 --> 51:28.480
I use their app every day.

51:28.480 --> 51:29.480
There is no contest.

51:29.480 --> 51:31.080
There just isn't.

51:31.080 --> 51:32.080
No contest.

51:32.080 --> 51:34.000
Well, and I would say no contest.

51:34.000 --> 51:38.540
If you want to dumb down the appearance of your desktop, yes, it's comparable.

51:38.540 --> 51:42.320
If you want it to be like you're sitting there with all the colors and the graphics and the

51:42.320 --> 51:45.880
sound and everything, no, I'm sorry.

51:45.880 --> 51:47.320
I'm saying that using both applications.

51:47.320 --> 51:48.320
Yeah, yeah.

51:48.320 --> 51:49.320
I agree with you too.

51:49.320 --> 51:50.320
I know.

51:50.320 --> 51:51.320
But I like TeamViewer.

51:51.320 --> 51:52.320
It's a good app.

51:52.320 --> 51:53.320
I use it a lot.

51:53.320 --> 52:00.160
This episode, Matt, our second sponsor, this episode is the 30-inch Sony Trinitron on eBay

52:00.160 --> 52:02.900
that Microcode has linked to us in the chat room.

52:02.900 --> 52:03.900
That's right.

52:03.900 --> 52:05.480
For $350, you can get a 30-inch Sony CRT.

52:05.480 --> 52:06.480
No, I'm kidding.

52:06.480 --> 52:07.480
But he did link it.

52:07.480 --> 52:11.960
I don't know why he linked a 30-inch CRT in our chat room.

52:11.960 --> 52:17.600
I guess if somebody out there wants a CRT, maybe you really want to get your retro on.

52:17.600 --> 52:19.280
Remember earlier when I mentioned getting your retro on?

52:19.280 --> 52:20.280
Well, that is...

52:20.280 --> 52:21.280
I'm kidding.

52:21.280 --> 52:22.280
Yeah.

52:22.280 --> 52:23.280
Although it does say HD.

52:23.280 --> 52:24.280
So there's that.

52:24.280 --> 52:25.280
There is that.

52:25.280 --> 52:26.280
Really?

52:26.280 --> 52:27.280
Wow.

52:27.280 --> 52:28.280
Yeah.

52:28.280 --> 52:29.280
Okay.

52:29.280 --> 52:30.280
I guess it doesn't say what resolution though.

52:30.280 --> 52:31.280
Oh, I take that back.

52:31.280 --> 52:32.280
It's CRT.

52:32.280 --> 52:33.280
It'll go up to 1080i.

52:33.280 --> 52:36.120
Actually, a 1080i CRT, I wouldn't mind seeing that.

52:36.120 --> 52:39.080
Well, I mean, it's like I know the refresh rate.

52:39.080 --> 52:40.680
Would you like to burn your eyeballs out or not?

52:40.680 --> 52:41.680
I mean, no, that matters.

52:41.680 --> 52:46.120
But if anything below 70 is going to make you get a headache, but yeah, it's just kind

52:46.120 --> 52:47.840
of like, yeah, you know what I mean?

52:47.840 --> 52:49.120
Hey, man, guess what?

52:49.120 --> 52:50.520
It's Energy Star compliant.

52:50.520 --> 52:55.360
Oh, well, that's important, especially when you're bringing in a 300-pound monitor onto

52:55.360 --> 52:56.360
your desk.

52:56.360 --> 52:57.360
I mean, you know.

52:57.360 --> 52:58.360
Going to bid now.

52:58.360 --> 52:59.360
I'm going to place a bid.

52:59.360 --> 53:00.360
It's not even available for buy now.

53:00.360 --> 53:02.240
You got to bid on this thing, on this bad boy.

53:02.240 --> 53:03.240
Oh, my God.

53:03.240 --> 53:07.360
No, our second sponsor this week is UnitySync from Directory Wizards.

53:07.360 --> 53:08.360
Woo-hoo.

53:08.360 --> 53:11.000
Here's the thing, you guys.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
I'm just going to save you a lot of trouble.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.440
I'm going to make you the IT wizard.

53:15.440 --> 53:20.440
Hey, hey, if you've got a directory synchronization problem, then you know what I'm talking about.

53:20.440 --> 53:24.800
If you've got desperate data stores that don't talk to each other, that need to talk to each

53:24.800 --> 53:27.000
other, UnitySync is going to solve this.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.560
And if you're in that position, you're going to become the IT hero.

53:29.560 --> 53:30.560
You're welcome.

53:30.560 --> 53:32.840
I just made you the savior of your IT department.

53:32.840 --> 53:33.840
You guys have been looking bad.

53:33.840 --> 53:37.300
Maybe your HR department keeps things up to date, but doesn't update your other database

53:37.300 --> 53:39.720
so that what gets pushed out to all the users is not current.

53:39.720 --> 53:42.040
Yes, I'm familiar with that situation.

53:42.040 --> 53:43.040
UnitySync is going to solve that.

53:43.040 --> 53:45.560
It goes way, way, way, way beyond that.

53:45.560 --> 53:51.080
If you've got Microsoft SQL database, Access databases, OpenLDAP, eDirectory, Active Directory,

53:51.080 --> 53:56.400
iMail, LDiff files, CSV files, Sun, whatever it is, if you need to move directory data

53:56.400 --> 54:00.520
between two different types of directories, you want to do it intelligently, and you want

54:00.520 --> 54:03.040
to do it maybe with some templates, you want to maybe throw a little Perl script in there

54:03.040 --> 54:06.280
to get extra flexibility, UnitySync is going to do that for you.

54:06.280 --> 54:10.200
Directory Wizards has created UnitySync to solve this problem, and it's available for

54:10.200 --> 54:11.200
Linux.

54:11.200 --> 54:16.640
We actually have two separate Active Directory domains that are completely individually apart

54:16.640 --> 54:17.640
from each other.

54:17.640 --> 54:22.920
The UnitySync is running on a Linux box keeping those two Active Directory machines in check.

54:22.920 --> 54:23.920
You know what I'm saying?

54:23.920 --> 54:24.920
You're bringing the Linux box.

54:24.920 --> 54:28.800
You could put it on a Windows machine if you're that guy, but you're not that guy.

54:28.800 --> 54:32.040
You're going to put it on a Linux box, and you're going to say, hey, boss, here's what

54:32.040 --> 54:33.040
I got for you.

54:33.040 --> 54:34.040
I got this UnitySync.

54:34.040 --> 54:37.280
We're going to load it on a rig, and if we use the code Linux when we download it, I'm

54:37.280 --> 54:41.080
going to get 30 days on a trial, so we can try it out for a month to make sure it's doing

54:41.080 --> 54:44.880
what we want, and if you use that code Linux, you're also going to get a year of maintenance

54:44.880 --> 54:45.880
for free.

54:45.880 --> 54:46.880
So the boss is going to like that.

54:46.880 --> 54:47.880
Oh, yeah.

54:47.880 --> 54:48.880
I say this is the way to go.

54:48.880 --> 54:52.720
He said, hey, look, look, we can get a year of maintenance on this, and UnitySync has

54:52.720 --> 54:58.240
a very, very competitive model where they charge based on the directory, not the users,

54:58.240 --> 55:00.160
and not the size of the database.

55:00.160 --> 55:02.080
Think about how nice that is.

55:02.080 --> 55:04.640
If you have something that's growing over time, you're not going to have to worry when

55:04.640 --> 55:06.880
it comes up time to renew that maintenance.

55:06.880 --> 55:09.560
So many vendors try to ding you for the size of the directory.

55:09.560 --> 55:10.560
That's ridiculous.

55:10.560 --> 55:12.000
Think about how computers work.

55:12.000 --> 55:17.720
Go over to dirwiz.com, click on UnitySync, and put in the code Linux for your trial download,

55:17.720 --> 55:20.560
and you'll unlock the extra bennies while you're over there.

55:20.560 --> 55:22.200
Check out some of their notable customers.

55:22.200 --> 55:24.160
Matt, have I showed you this list yet?

55:24.160 --> 55:25.880
No, I have not seen the list.

55:25.880 --> 55:28.780
Well, there's a few people on here, like the Air Force Command and Control Information

55:28.780 --> 55:29.780
Systems of Canada.

55:29.780 --> 55:32.080
Oh, no one's heard of these guys.

55:32.080 --> 55:33.080
They use UnitySync.

55:33.080 --> 55:34.080
The Army.

55:34.080 --> 55:38.560
DC Council uses UnitySync.

55:38.560 --> 55:41.760
The list goes on on Fiserv uses UnitySync.

55:41.760 --> 55:43.480
The US Marines use UnitySync.

55:43.480 --> 55:44.480
The NFL.

55:44.480 --> 55:45.480
Anheuser-Busch uses UnitySync.

55:45.480 --> 55:46.480
I mean, this is enterprise-grade, Matt.

55:46.480 --> 55:47.480
Yeah, people like beer.

55:47.480 --> 55:48.480
I mean, come on.

55:48.480 --> 55:49.480
Awesome.

55:49.480 --> 55:50.480
All right.

55:50.480 --> 55:56.060
I need, every time Anheuser-Busch needs to update something about Budweiser to their

55:56.060 --> 55:59.080
Red Hook directory, UnitySync's taking care of it for them.

55:59.080 --> 56:01.680
And the nice thing is, is UnitySync can go in there and just move a record, or it can

56:01.680 --> 56:02.880
move everything in that directory.

56:02.880 --> 56:03.880
It can be super intelligent.

56:03.880 --> 56:05.160
It can be safe.

56:05.160 --> 56:08.120
No per-user cost makes it super nice for scaling.

56:08.120 --> 56:10.080
And of course, it's great for backup, too.

56:10.080 --> 56:13.160
So use the code LINUX when you're downloading the demo and check it out.

56:13.160 --> 56:14.960
Go save the day.

56:14.960 --> 56:19.600
IT can get run over by the other people in the company when these kinds of problems aren't

56:19.600 --> 56:20.600
solved.

56:20.600 --> 56:21.600
And I have been there.

56:21.600 --> 56:22.600
That leads to burnout.

56:22.600 --> 56:26.000
That leaves people feeling a little hostile.

56:26.000 --> 56:27.000
Oh, yeah.

56:27.000 --> 56:28.760
We don't want you to have a hostile work environment.

56:28.760 --> 56:30.400
No IT out here.

56:30.400 --> 56:31.400
No.

56:31.400 --> 56:32.400
No.

56:32.400 --> 56:33.400
We're hooking you guys up.

56:33.400 --> 56:34.400
And so is UnitySync.

56:34.400 --> 56:37.680
So thanks to UnitySync for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

56:37.680 --> 56:38.680
Good stuff.

56:38.680 --> 56:39.680
All right.

56:39.680 --> 56:43.280
So I got a couple more emails I want to make sure we get through.

56:43.280 --> 56:46.720
We're almost running out of time, and I still have an inbox full of email, Matt.

56:46.720 --> 56:48.680
It's like we're going to have to just keep doing this.

56:48.680 --> 56:50.280
So David wrote in.

56:50.280 --> 56:52.960
He says, go for Unplugged.

56:52.960 --> 56:54.200
Hi, Chris and Matt.

56:54.200 --> 56:57.680
I was so excited to hear about the extra show, and it's absolutely excellent.

56:57.680 --> 57:01.280
My suggestion, don't change the format at all.

57:01.280 --> 57:03.680
From what you have done already, it's excellent.

57:03.680 --> 57:04.680
It's open.

57:04.680 --> 57:05.680
It's frank.

57:05.680 --> 57:06.680
And the discussions are great.

57:06.680 --> 57:09.200
And what you've done for the Linux world is perfect, and presented the new show with the

57:09.200 --> 57:10.200
same professionalism.

57:10.200 --> 57:14.760
And from the heart and nature of Lass, he says, I have released episode 9 of Linux Down

57:14.760 --> 57:19.200
Under podcast, LDUP for short, which is my own small contribution to the Linux industry

57:19.200 --> 57:20.480
with an Aussie view.

57:20.480 --> 57:24.120
Keep up the good work, and thank you so much for giving us the extra awesome show.

57:24.120 --> 57:25.320
Spend time to listen to.

57:25.320 --> 57:26.320
All things Linux Unplugged.

57:26.320 --> 57:29.560
He says, by the way, Matt, don't hate on Fedora too much.

57:29.560 --> 57:32.120
He's a Fedora and a KDE user.

57:32.120 --> 57:35.600
You know, I'm a big Red Hat company fan, as far as Fedora is concerned.

57:35.600 --> 57:39.680
I keep revisiting it, and you know, my mind could totally change one day.

57:39.680 --> 57:40.680
It could totally happen.

57:40.680 --> 57:41.680
I don't know.

57:41.680 --> 57:44.400
I feel like I should keep reading.

57:44.400 --> 57:47.960
We got so many emails that came in, and I haven't even gotten to the BitMessages.

57:47.960 --> 57:53.800
By the way, what would you think about us doing like an in-depth, hey, what do you think

57:53.800 --> 57:57.480
about doing this week slash Etsy on BitMessage?

57:57.480 --> 57:58.480
It's just kind of like I could just show it.

57:58.480 --> 58:01.880
Yeah, because like someone like me that's not using it would love to know more about

58:01.880 --> 58:02.880
it.

58:02.880 --> 58:06.760
You get to watch it as a kind of a participant in a sense from afar, but not really using

58:06.760 --> 58:07.760
it daily.

58:07.760 --> 58:10.560
So one of the things I was thinking we could show is one of the nice features about BitMessage

58:10.560 --> 58:13.720
is you can have an address that multiple people subscribe to.

58:13.720 --> 58:19.300
So we could have a feedback address for this show that when people send to that, it goes

58:19.300 --> 58:21.720
to both our BitMessage inboxes.

58:21.720 --> 58:22.720
I like that.

58:22.720 --> 58:27.520
I kind of, you know, I do want to roll my own email server because I have to talk to

58:27.520 --> 58:33.640
the rest of the world, but at the same time, I really feel like, you know, email is broken

58:33.640 --> 58:38.800
fundamentally from a security standpoint and BitMessage really, really addresses a lot.

58:38.800 --> 58:44.680
Like even if, even if BitMessage was unencrypted and clear text, I would still think BitMessage

58:44.680 --> 58:47.760
is a good idea just based on the peer to peer nature.

58:47.760 --> 58:51.200
The peer to peer nature has some downsides than everybody's downloading everybody's messages,

58:51.200 --> 58:56.160
but only if you can only open those messages if you have the right cryptographic answer

58:56.160 --> 59:00.160
to the question, which means there's no metadata to collect.

59:00.160 --> 59:02.120
There's no monitoring that can happen.

59:02.120 --> 59:03.840
There's this blockchain concept.

59:03.840 --> 59:07.720
People download it, they have the answer, they unlock the content, and then they can

59:07.720 --> 59:08.720
read it.

59:08.720 --> 59:12.480
And I think, I think whenever we see something that comes out like this, that fundamentally

59:12.480 --> 59:18.000
solves a privacy issue or a security issue, like encryption by default and it's open source,

59:18.000 --> 59:22.760
I wouldn't mind, I wouldn't mind focusing on that in our shows, giving attention to

59:22.760 --> 59:23.760
that.

59:23.760 --> 59:24.760
Absolutely.

59:24.760 --> 59:25.760
No, I think that's a great idea.

59:25.760 --> 59:28.880
I think we need to experiment and see what it is because I remember when RSS was a big

59:28.880 --> 59:32.400
deal, solving different problems, obviously, but it was solving the newsletter problem

59:32.400 --> 59:34.920
and the spam folder problem and all that sort of thing.

59:34.920 --> 59:40.040
And it never really took off as much as people thought it would, you know, it was the email

59:40.040 --> 59:41.040
killer and all this.

59:41.040 --> 59:45.400
But with BitMessage, I think it does go a step closer than RSS does in that.

59:45.400 --> 59:50.000
Well, one of the interesting aspects of BitMessage is in order to communicate something to the

59:50.000 --> 59:55.560
network, you have to do relatively a costly proof of concept work.

59:55.560 --> 59:56.560
You have to do a proof of work.

59:56.560 --> 59:57.800
You have to do some math.

59:57.800 --> 59:59.260
You have to calculate for the network.

59:59.260 --> 01:00:01.040
You have to crunch numbers.

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:05.760
And that is not a big deal when you're firing off, you know, a few bit messages.

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:12.520
But if you want to, if you want to spam on a mass scale, the CPU cost is, is, is extremely

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:13.520
high.

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:14.520
Exactly.

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:16.680
It destroys profitability for spamming.

01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:21.720
It's not impossible to spam the BitMessage network, but the cost to do it CPU wise is

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:23.480
really unsustainable.

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:28.160
So that's one of the interesting things about BitMessage is while without actually charging

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:33.100
money, they have found a way to introduce cost to prevent spamming.

01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:34.600
That's a really interesting point.

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:40.500
And not only that, but it's inherently easy enough to do for a newsletter type environment.

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:43.120
Like you talked about a community, basically a community bucket to where everybody can

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:44.880
kind of pile into that.

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:47.640
It's going to be interesting to see where it evolves to, you know, and again, I'm a

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:48.640
total newbie to BitMessage.

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:52.200
So, I mean, this is going to be interesting for me as a, as an end user to be introduced

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:53.600
to it and to really get my feet wet.

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:56.520
All right, man, I'm going to say the last chance for anybody that's watching live that

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:59.740
wants to call in Skype us at Jupiterbroadcasting.com.

01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:02.880
Hopefully next week we'll have the mumble deal all figured out.

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:05.640
Just got an email from David at the elementary OS project.

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:08.120
He says, hi there, elementary OS developer here.

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:10.880
I'm curious about coming on the show and talking to you guys.

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:13.960
I don't have Skype set up right now on Linux, but I'd love to join you on mumble in the

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:14.960
future.

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:15.960
So there you go.

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:16.960
That sounds like a great idea.

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:17.960
There you go, David.

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:20.620
We'd love to have you on a Linux unplugged in the future and hopefully we'll have mumble

01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:21.620
set up.

01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:25.640
Matt and I are thinking we're going to have a, hopefully if everything works out, we'll

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:29.600
have a mumble room for people just to hang out out in general, specifically to hang out

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:34.320
during live shows, Linux unplugged in particular, just a lobby for people to chat.

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:36.600
Then we'll have a screening room where you'll get moved into.

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.780
You can join on your own volition where people can just get in there and say, hey, I'd like

01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:40.980
to go on air.

01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:44.120
And we'll have an operator in there who will check your mic, make sure your audio is working,

01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:47.000
make sure you don't have your stream on, you know, the college radio thing.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.600
And then they're going to move you into what we'll probably have as a showroom where anybody

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:53.400
in that room can go on air.

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:55.940
And it's not like you have to jump through some sort of crazy hoop, it's just you have

01:01:55.940 --> 01:02:00.120
to pay basic flight checks and then eventually you'll kind of, I would love to even have

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:04.180
people who have a known good status and they can always just enter the room directly and

01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:05.180
contribute away.

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:06.420
I think that'd be great too.

01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:07.420
That would be awesome.

01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:08.420
Yeah.

01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:09.420
Kind of a green room, if you will.

01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:10.420
Yeah.

01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:11.420
We'll have a green room to make sure you're all ready for flight.

01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:14.640
And then we'll actually have the flight deck where when you go in there, you're on air

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:16.780
and you just boom right in there.

01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:19.000
And I think that's going to be a great way for people to contribute to the show in real

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000
time.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.120
So yeah, I think we'll call it right there.

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:23.580
I got so much more stuff, Matt.

01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:24.580
I got so much more stuff.

01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:25.580
I know.

01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:26.580
It's just like overflowing out of the-

01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:27.580
Yeah.

01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:31.900
I mean, we could go for another hour and still only have scratched just the bottom of the

01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:32.960
barrel of these emails.

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:36.320
Just not even, like a little nick, Matt, a little nick off the top.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.840
But I'm glad we were able to get to the ones we could.

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:39.840
I actually have a few more.

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:42.680
Gosh, I hate to wrap up, Matt, but I got to go make dinner.

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:43.680
I got to go make dinner.

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:44.680
That's not what it is.

01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:45.680
Dinner thing.

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:46.680
Huh?

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:47.680
Yeah.

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:48.680
It's that dinner thing.

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:49.680
It's that food thing, Matt.

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:50.680
It's that dinner thing.

01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:51.680
Plus, I ran out of beer.

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:52.680
So...

01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:53.680
Well, that's it.

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:54.680
There's your sign.

01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:58.000
Once I'm out of beer, that's kind of the indication that the show's over.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000
All right.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.920
Well, I want to make sure everybody joins us next Sunday for the big show.

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:02.920
We'll be talking about...

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:05.760
One of the things we'll be talking about is Ubuntu Edge, among other things, like probably

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:09.640
BitMessage, and a few other nice little surprises, plus the news.

01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:10.640
Don't forget, we'd love to hear your feedback.

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:14.640
You can just email us, linuxactionshow at jupiterbroadcasting.com or start a thread in

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:17.600
our subreddit over at linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:22.840
And you can join us live Mondays at 2 p.m. Pacific over at jblive.tv.

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:23.840
Always great to have you guys.

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:25.000
Love to see you next time.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Hey, Matt, have a great week.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000
You too.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000
We'll see you soon.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000
All right, everyone.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:55.880
We'll see you next week for Linux Unplugged.
