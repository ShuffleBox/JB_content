00:00.000 --> 00:08.160
After a little over three years in development, the Inkscape team has launched the long-awaited

00:08.160 --> 00:14.080
version 1.0, and I think Cheesy Bacon over there would be the man to talk to about this.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.640
What do you think, Cheeze, of their 1.0?

00:15.640 --> 00:18.600
Anything really jump out at you as, like, a great new feature, or...?

00:18.600 --> 00:22.560
Well, I mean, they have done a lot of work in three years, it seems.

00:22.560 --> 00:28.320
Better high DPI support, we all want that on our vector art applications.

00:28.320 --> 00:34.800
Belaying and chamfering corners, so if you, say, converted some text to a shape and you

00:34.800 --> 00:38.200
wanted to round corners or chamfer corners, you can easily do that now.

00:38.200 --> 00:45.920
They've got some new PNG export options, they've got this really cool split view of X-ray mode

00:45.920 --> 00:50.880
and your art mode, so you can basically split the screen to see where all of your lines

00:50.880 --> 00:56.040
intersect in a crazy busy piece of vector art, and then you can reveal your actual piece

00:56.040 --> 00:58.240
of art kind of at the same time.

00:58.240 --> 01:00.120
Just a bunch of really cool new features.

01:00.120 --> 01:04.080
Variable fonts have been included, there's some additional extensions that have been

01:04.080 --> 01:12.000
added in, pro-level features that you would expect to see in an Adobe or Affinity application,

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
for sure.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Yeah, pro for sure.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.400
It really does seem like it's truly a pro-level app, it's completely cross-platform.

01:18.400 --> 01:22.240
And speaking of extensions, Brent, I know you're excited to see this Python 3 support

01:22.240 --> 01:23.240
now.

01:23.240 --> 01:24.240
How'd you know that was my favorite?

01:24.240 --> 01:25.240
Really?

01:25.240 --> 01:36.120
Let's go check it out.

01:36.120 --> 01:40.560
Hello friends, and welcome into 352 of your local Linux talk show.

01:40.560 --> 01:41.560
My name is Chris.

01:41.560 --> 01:42.560
My name is Wes.

01:42.560 --> 01:45.600
Oh, fresh from the woods episode, right here for you all.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.480
It's a big show today.

01:47.480 --> 01:50.800
In-house we have the System76 Lemur Pro.

01:50.800 --> 01:53.800
In my hot little hands, I barely can even feel it, it's so light.

01:53.800 --> 01:54.800
Let's play toss, Wes, catch!

01:54.800 --> 02:01.360
And I will tell you about the incredible endurance test I put this thing through.

02:01.360 --> 02:07.960
I thought to myself, it seems to me System76 is really signaling that this laptop has an

02:07.960 --> 02:09.360
impressive battery.

02:09.360 --> 02:11.520
So let's see how impressive it is.

02:11.520 --> 02:16.520
I took the laptop and I took my cell phone and I went into the woods and spent a 12-hour

02:16.520 --> 02:18.520
workday in the woods with this laptop.

02:18.520 --> 02:20.720
I'll tell you how it all went a little bit in the show.

02:20.720 --> 02:22.200
That's why there's moss on your beard.

02:22.200 --> 02:23.760
Yeah, I'm going to keep it.

02:23.760 --> 02:24.760
I'm going to keep it.

02:24.760 --> 02:27.760
So before we go any further, I got to say a big howdy to Mr. Bacon.

02:27.760 --> 02:28.760
Hello, Cheesy.

02:28.760 --> 02:29.760
Hey there.

02:29.760 --> 02:32.760
You know, they need to contract you to take their product photos too because you were

02:32.760 --> 02:34.360
taking some awesome photos of that Lemur.

02:34.360 --> 02:35.360
Well, thank you.

02:35.360 --> 02:36.600
I mean, there's a lot coming from you.

02:36.600 --> 02:38.160
Well, I appreciate that.

02:38.160 --> 02:40.360
Yeah, I posted them on the old Instagram.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.400
I got a link in the show notes to the album.

02:42.400 --> 02:45.560
So if you want to see what the sucker looks like out in the woods, it's just a man with

02:45.560 --> 02:47.360
his laptop and his camera phone, Chees.

02:47.360 --> 02:48.840
It was a beautiful thing.

02:48.840 --> 02:50.320
It was beautiful.

02:50.320 --> 02:55.960
And of course, a huge, massive time appropriate greetings to that virtual log.

02:55.960 --> 02:56.960
Hello, Mumble Room.

02:56.960 --> 02:57.960
Hello.

02:57.960 --> 02:58.960
Hello.

02:58.960 --> 02:59.960
Hello.

02:59.960 --> 03:00.960
Wow.

03:00.960 --> 03:01.960
Happy Linux Tuesday.

03:01.960 --> 03:04.960
We're hitting 40 people just about in there now when you combine in the quiet listening

03:04.960 --> 03:05.960
to.

03:05.960 --> 03:06.960
Incredible.

03:06.960 --> 03:11.640
And I'm happy to say that Philip from Mangero is here today to cover some cool Mangero news.

03:11.640 --> 03:12.640
Hello, Philip.

03:12.640 --> 03:13.640
Hello.

03:13.640 --> 03:14.640
Hello.

03:14.640 --> 03:15.640
Hello.

03:15.640 --> 03:16.640
Thank you for joining us, sir.

03:16.640 --> 03:17.640
It's great to have you here.

03:17.640 --> 03:19.360
I'm excited to get to your news here in a moment.

03:19.360 --> 03:24.400
But we have a little bit of follow up we need to do on the show right here at the top because

03:24.400 --> 03:26.240
it's something the audience has been asking about.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.040
It's something we committed to.

03:28.040 --> 03:29.800
And there has been some recent developments.

03:29.800 --> 03:31.200
Are you ready, Westpain?

03:31.200 --> 03:33.200
Standing by.

03:33.200 --> 03:40.980
Westpain, it's time to live update our Arch server right here.

03:40.980 --> 03:42.960
See how it goes live on the show.

03:42.960 --> 03:48.720
Now recently, behind the scenes, we switched this box to the LTS kernel.

03:48.720 --> 03:52.040
It was left on the cutting room floor from a previous version of the show.

03:52.040 --> 03:53.920
But that recent change was made.

03:53.920 --> 03:57.720
Our Arch server is now powered by that LTS kernel.

03:57.720 --> 04:02.120
But it's time for a big upgrade, including system D, a new version of WireGuard, and

04:02.120 --> 04:03.120
much more.

04:03.120 --> 04:04.120
So, Westpain?

04:04.120 --> 04:05.120
Logging into the server.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.120
Good man.

04:06.120 --> 04:09.880
Now, this was our commitment a long time ago, and we decided to, for no good reason, build

04:09.880 --> 04:12.840
an Arch server and then have it run our critical infrastructure.

04:12.840 --> 04:14.200
We thought we'd let you know how it goes.

04:14.200 --> 04:17.580
Now, this is our minimum viable approach to Arch.

04:17.580 --> 04:21.080
Most of the applications are in containers, but one thing we didn't do originally, I think

04:21.080 --> 04:24.880
because of WireGuard potentially, is we didn't go with the LTS kernel.

04:24.880 --> 04:27.320
And you know, why not just try full rolling?

04:27.320 --> 04:28.320
Yeah.

04:28.320 --> 04:33.120
We decided after not being able to boot one time that it'd probably be better to switch

04:33.120 --> 04:34.120
to LTS.

04:34.120 --> 04:35.120
We made that change.

04:35.120 --> 04:38.680
Yeah, I mean, we're really dependent on ZFS for the system not to boot, but for all those

04:38.680 --> 04:40.160
containerized applications.

04:40.160 --> 04:45.040
And as great as the ZFS on Linux project is doing, the Arch kernel is just moving a little

04:45.040 --> 04:46.040
too fast sometimes.

04:46.040 --> 04:47.040
All right.

04:47.040 --> 04:48.040
It's updating.

04:48.040 --> 04:51.440
We've synchronized our package database, pulling down new packages.

04:51.440 --> 04:52.840
Snapper is taking a pre-snapshot.

04:52.840 --> 04:53.840
Really?

04:53.840 --> 04:55.280
We're that far into it already.

04:55.280 --> 04:56.520
And here's where it gets interesting.

04:56.520 --> 05:01.840
We do have a new point release of the LTS kernel, so DKMS is currently removing our old

05:01.840 --> 05:03.400
ZFS module.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.400
There's no going back now.

05:04.400 --> 05:07.760
Now, do you know what version of LTS kernel?

05:07.760 --> 05:09.520
Last time I checked, it was 5.4.

05:09.520 --> 05:10.520
Is that what we're sticking with?

05:10.520 --> 05:11.520
Yeah, let's see.

05:11.520 --> 05:12.520
It was 5.4.33.3.

05:12.520 --> 05:13.520
Yeah.

05:13.520 --> 05:15.520
And what do we got now?

05:15.520 --> 05:16.520
Scrolling, scrolling, scrolling.

05:16.520 --> 05:17.520
5.4.35.1, maybe?

05:17.520 --> 05:18.520
5.4.38.

05:18.520 --> 05:19.520
All right.

05:19.520 --> 05:23.280
And we also, along with this, are going to get a new version of ZFS and WireGuard and

05:23.280 --> 05:24.280
SystemD.

05:24.280 --> 05:25.320
All right.

05:25.320 --> 05:28.580
You want me to let you proceed with the reboot, and then we'll check back in?

05:28.580 --> 05:29.580
That sounds good.

05:29.580 --> 05:30.580
All right.

05:30.580 --> 05:31.580
Very good.

05:31.580 --> 05:32.580
All right, Wes.

05:32.580 --> 05:33.580
We'll be right back.

05:33.580 --> 05:34.580
Let's see how it goes.

05:34.580 --> 05:40.880
In the meantime, on the other end, from server to light and portable, Philip and the team

05:40.880 --> 05:48.080
at Manjaro today announced a new partnership with Star Labs for two different super tiny

05:48.080 --> 05:51.860
portable machines, really lightweight laptops.

05:51.860 --> 05:56.840
And I also noted, too, that there's a 10% sale going on right now.

05:56.840 --> 06:01.320
The price is unbelievably low for both of them, Philip.

06:01.320 --> 06:07.960
This seems like more, not even more choice, but like a more aggressive style of choice

06:07.960 --> 06:10.320
that the Manjaro project is pursuing in this partnership.

06:10.320 --> 06:11.320
Exactly.

06:11.320 --> 06:15.960
Because we found a new partner, and it's Star Labs, and they produce their own laptops.

06:15.960 --> 06:18.880
So it's no Clevo branding, something like that.

06:18.880 --> 06:25.380
So since 2018, they came around and said, just doing rebrands, this doesn't work out.

06:25.380 --> 06:28.600
So we designed it ourselves and pushed it out there.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.880
And we are happy to be part of that.

06:30.880 --> 06:32.560
Let's start with the details here.

06:32.560 --> 06:36.540
So we have two laptops, an 11-inch and a 13-inch.

06:36.540 --> 06:43.040
The 11-inch starts at $424 US greenbacks, and the 13-inch starts at $749 US greenbacks.

06:43.040 --> 06:45.440
It's an aluminum anodized chassis.

06:45.440 --> 06:50.100
The display is LED backlit on both of them using IPS technology.

06:50.100 --> 06:52.400
Both of them are 1080 displays.

06:52.400 --> 06:59.560
The 11-inch has a Pentium N4200, I think, which I think works out to be a 1.1 gigahertz

06:59.560 --> 07:05.200
quad core, where the 13-inch has a slightly more powerful, noticeably more powerful i7

07:05.200 --> 07:08.360
unit that works out to be 1.8 gigahertz quad core.

07:08.360 --> 07:12.920
Both of them are coming with a pretty good amount of storage, 240 gigabytes, 8 gigabytes

07:12.920 --> 07:19.420
of RAM in these suckers, and Intel graphics 505 and 620, respectively.

07:19.420 --> 07:26.440
With USB-C connectivity and charging, with all the typical wireless things you would

07:26.440 --> 07:33.520
expect, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, USB-C video out, seven hours of battery life on the 11-inch

07:33.520 --> 07:39.600
and seven hours of battery life on the 13-inch, the weight is super low, too.

07:39.600 --> 07:44.200
These things are 2.54 pounds and 2.65 pounds.

07:44.200 --> 07:46.400
Comes in the box with a USB-C power adapter as well.

07:46.400 --> 07:49.960
You know, I've been thinking about maybe building a new desktop, and having a light little to

07:49.960 --> 07:53.540
go laptop to support that, these seem perfect for this.

07:53.540 --> 07:55.320
So what's the partnership look like here, Philip?

07:55.320 --> 07:59.840
Did you guys work on having to customize the image for these laptops?

07:59.840 --> 08:01.160
Is it running stock manager?

08:01.160 --> 08:02.360
What's that aspect of it like?

08:02.360 --> 08:09.120
Well, we partnered up, so we had a meeting with Sean from Starlabs, and they actually

08:09.120 --> 08:11.360
wrote us several times.

08:11.360 --> 08:20.240
We had the Station X in 2017, and Starlabs also wrote us, but we thought, hey, a new

08:20.240 --> 08:22.720
startup with no homepage is not a pretty deal.

08:22.720 --> 08:28.920
So we went for Station X back then, and they kept on writing, and now this year we said,

08:28.920 --> 08:32.800
okay, we have time for them, and started the meeting.

08:32.800 --> 08:38.480
And we connected right away, and two days later we had the laptops kind of worked on

08:38.480 --> 08:41.120
and optimized everything from Mancharo.

08:41.120 --> 08:46.760
And yesterday we did this little Star Wars teaser, may the force be with you, and today

08:46.760 --> 08:49.640
we released the news to the world.

08:49.640 --> 08:50.760
Yeah, that was great.

08:50.760 --> 08:54.720
I didn't expect to see it so soon, but it's fantastic to see the news out already.

08:54.720 --> 08:56.240
My question for you is this.

08:56.240 --> 09:01.040
As a project, it seems like you guys are jumping at the opportunity to work with hardware vendors

09:01.040 --> 09:03.320
to offer Mancharo systems preloaded.

09:03.320 --> 09:06.220
Do you have a sense that is a high demand from your community?

09:06.220 --> 09:11.760
And also, like I note, the recent efforts around the Rock Pro 64 chip and how Mancharo

09:11.760 --> 09:17.120
has become just exceptionally easy to deploy on the Pine 64 Rock Pro 64, and that again

09:17.120 --> 09:20.920
is kind of partnering in a sense with a hardware vendor.

09:20.920 --> 09:23.080
Do you think an area of importance for the project?

09:23.080 --> 09:28.200
Well, Mancharo is a desktop Linux, and we try to get as much hardware out there.

09:28.200 --> 09:35.800
But when we choose a hardware, it has to be a partnership worldwide, which Starlabs does.

09:35.800 --> 09:38.900
And they have also the possibilities to repair this stuff.

09:38.900 --> 09:43.260
So if you had a broken laptop from them, you can buy parts from them.

09:43.260 --> 09:47.320
So repairing is a huge demand from our end.

09:47.320 --> 09:51.840
And yes, they're a cool bunch of guys and happy to work with them.

09:51.840 --> 09:52.840
Well, that's great.

09:52.840 --> 09:56.320
I mean, that's really nice to hear that it's been an easy partnership there.

09:56.320 --> 09:58.400
Do you have one of these guys kicking around yet?

09:58.400 --> 10:03.960
Yes, we got two devices from the 11 inch to 13 inch we might get as well.

10:03.960 --> 10:11.240
And there is a new plan for a 15.6 inch laptop, which is not yet finalized.

10:11.240 --> 10:18.200
But we will get redesigns of everything and the community and the Starlabs community decided

10:18.200 --> 10:21.040
to have a little bit hardware upgrade and such.

10:21.040 --> 10:25.920
But this will come maybe late summer to winter.

10:25.920 --> 10:30.000
So to the seasons and we might have even more laptops to go with them.

10:30.000 --> 10:34.600
I'm curious to know what your first impressions are and if you prefer the 11 or 13 inch.

10:34.600 --> 10:40.720
I fell in love with the 11 inch because it's a fanless and long lasting and comes in a

10:40.720 --> 10:41.720
little box.

10:41.720 --> 10:44.360
We have a sleeve, we have our skin protection.

10:44.360 --> 10:51.080
So they've designed everything from the chassis to the internals and the power supply is also

10:51.080 --> 10:57.360
designed by them and it comes with the small little changers so we can plug it out for

10:57.360 --> 10:58.360
each system.

10:58.360 --> 11:04.120
If it's UK, if it's European or is it the States, you have the little small adapters

11:04.120 --> 11:05.120
with you.

11:05.120 --> 11:09.640
You simply plug them out and plug them in and go with it independently.

11:09.640 --> 11:12.280
And it's USB charging in both ends.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.060
You can even charge your laptop.

11:14.060 --> 11:17.240
So one connection to rule them all.

11:17.240 --> 11:19.080
I really love that it's fanless.

11:19.080 --> 11:20.080
That's exciting.

11:20.080 --> 11:23.480
And you know like you were saying Wes, you have a desktop system and then you take this

11:23.480 --> 11:25.120
11 inch with you.

11:25.120 --> 11:30.520
It is at this price point cheaper than an iPad with a keyboard.

11:30.520 --> 11:36.040
And it runs Linux and it runs Manjaro Linux so you have the entire Pacman software library

11:36.040 --> 11:37.040
repository.

11:37.040 --> 11:39.800
That'll be really easy to get my WireGuard VPN up back home.

11:39.800 --> 11:40.800
Perfect.

11:40.800 --> 11:44.920
Yeah, I mean seriously, if you know people out there that are looking at like the iPad,

11:44.920 --> 11:49.440
especially if you get the iPad with that new Magic Keyboard, that keyboard alone is $300.

11:49.440 --> 11:52.000
So it's almost the entire price of the 11 inch.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.080
You can get a couple of them.

11:55.080 --> 11:56.080
Wow, Philipp.

11:56.080 --> 11:57.080
Well, this is awesome.

11:57.080 --> 11:58.120
So are they available now?

11:58.120 --> 11:59.320
Are they shipping soon?

11:59.320 --> 12:02.120
Yeah, you can order them there of course.

12:02.120 --> 12:08.440
And if you have to update your firmware, it's done within Manjaro so you don't have to even

12:08.440 --> 12:13.360
reboot to simply get the firmwares automatically with Gnome firmware software.

12:13.360 --> 12:17.040
And if you want, you can deactivate wireless and webcam of course.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.040
That's great.

12:18.040 --> 12:21.560
This sounds like a great machine and that 13 inch looks pretty nice too, especially

12:21.560 --> 12:26.240
if you need a little bit larger working space and you want that i7 processor.

12:26.240 --> 12:27.240
Very cool.

12:27.240 --> 12:28.240
I'll be keeping an eye out.

12:28.240 --> 12:30.600
I would like to see if anybody ends up with one of these, please write into the show.

12:30.600 --> 12:34.720
I'd like to hear your thoughts, linuxunplug.com slash contact.

12:34.720 --> 12:38.720
I think it's going to be a pretty good year for Linux users that are looking at hardware

12:38.720 --> 12:39.720
right now.

12:39.720 --> 12:43.840
I mean, just Manjaro alone, Philipp, has several options now and it sounds like more down the

12:43.840 --> 12:44.840
road.

12:44.840 --> 12:45.840
Exactly.

12:45.840 --> 12:48.840
I think it might be one of those, you know, it's a slow burn right now, but in a year

12:48.840 --> 12:52.240
or two, we're going to look back and it'll be a wildly different landscape with a ton

12:52.240 --> 12:56.340
of options compared to before where you just had to, you know, buy some off the shelf windows

12:56.340 --> 12:58.000
machine and hope for the best.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
It's true.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.260
All right, Mr. Payne, well, you're not off the hook.

13:01.260 --> 13:03.120
How are we doing over there?

13:03.120 --> 13:04.920
Did the system come back online?

13:04.920 --> 13:05.920
Not yet.

13:05.920 --> 13:06.920
Really?

13:06.920 --> 13:07.920
Not yet.

13:07.920 --> 13:08.920
How long ago did it reboot?

13:08.920 --> 13:09.920
Well, just a minute or two.

13:09.920 --> 13:15.040
And it does take quite some time to post as we well know, I could make a run to the server

13:15.040 --> 13:16.040
room.

13:16.040 --> 13:17.040
Oh, nope.

13:17.040 --> 13:18.040
Here we go.

13:18.040 --> 13:19.040
Here we go.

13:19.040 --> 13:20.040
Akilas is going down.

13:20.040 --> 13:21.040
I don't have to get up.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.040
That's always right at the moment.

13:22.040 --> 13:24.240
That's how long that's exactly what happens every time.

13:24.240 --> 13:25.240
Yeah.

13:25.240 --> 13:28.000
It's almost like how you got to get up to go to the bathroom for your food to get delivered

13:28.000 --> 13:29.320
when we used to go to restaurants.

13:29.320 --> 13:31.480
That's how that server is when it comes to boot time.

13:31.480 --> 13:34.720
I was just going to float this out there.

13:34.720 --> 13:36.180
Here's a crazy idea.

13:36.180 --> 13:39.320
You know what another safe way to run Arch as a server would have been?

13:39.320 --> 13:44.200
To put Proxmox or something on that and then run Arch server as a VM.

13:44.200 --> 13:45.400
Where's the fun in that, though?

13:45.400 --> 13:47.440
Then we could have at least gotten the console from here.

13:47.440 --> 13:49.280
All right, so we're back up.

13:49.280 --> 13:50.280
Looks that way.

13:50.280 --> 13:51.280
I see ZFS file systems.

13:51.280 --> 13:52.280
You do, huh?

13:52.280 --> 13:53.840
I think we're still starting up.

13:53.840 --> 13:56.640
Okay, applications seem like they're starting.

13:56.640 --> 13:58.320
Let's see.

13:58.320 --> 14:00.720
Final seconds, Wes.

14:00.720 --> 14:01.720
Can come back online.

14:01.720 --> 14:02.720
Yeah.

14:02.720 --> 14:03.720
Here we go.

14:03.720 --> 14:04.720
Really?

14:04.720 --> 14:05.720
You got it?

14:05.720 --> 14:06.720
Are you declaring victory?

14:06.720 --> 14:07.880
I am declaring victory.

14:07.880 --> 14:12.280
We've got the new system D, new kernel continuing to work with ZFS and WireGuard.

14:12.280 --> 14:13.280
Congratulations, sir.

14:13.280 --> 14:20.760
That is, I think, longer than I expected it to last at this point.

14:20.760 --> 14:22.700
I think we have crossed that threshold.

14:22.700 --> 14:26.960
What I'm really happy about too is that we've got rid of the DKMS for WireGuard, which is

14:26.960 --> 14:27.960
great.

14:27.960 --> 14:30.860
Now we have ZFS and we will for the foreseeable future.

14:30.860 --> 14:31.860
It just keeps working.

14:31.860 --> 14:36.560
We haven't run into a problem where we had to go futz with getting the ZFS systems remounting,

14:36.560 --> 14:39.740
cleaning up all the stuff that gets kind of broken when that happens.

14:39.740 --> 14:41.200
It's just rock solid.

14:41.200 --> 14:42.880
I'm still loving it.

14:42.880 --> 14:43.880
Lean, mean.

14:43.880 --> 14:46.940
And when you do the updates, it's not hundreds of packages.

14:46.940 --> 14:49.340
It's 15 at most, maybe.

14:49.340 --> 14:50.340
It's pretty light.

14:50.340 --> 14:54.980
I will also say we've been, we switched it up, we've been using the yay AUR helper written

14:54.980 --> 14:55.980
in Go.

14:55.980 --> 14:56.980
And that's been really a dream.

14:56.980 --> 15:00.160
It's fast, works well, it's easy to update and hasn't broken yet.

15:00.160 --> 15:02.880
Yeah, I'm using that on my Manjaro workstation too.

15:02.880 --> 15:06.280
And then I get all of the AUR updates done at the same time.

15:06.280 --> 15:07.280
I like it.

15:07.280 --> 15:08.280
And it's actually really good too.

15:08.280 --> 15:13.400
The other thing it's really smart about is it realizes that sometimes there's AUR apps

15:13.400 --> 15:14.400
you want to skip.

15:14.400 --> 15:19.040
And so right before it does all the AUR updates, it asks you, would you like to skip any of

15:19.040 --> 15:20.040
these?

15:20.040 --> 15:21.040
And it gives each one a number value.

15:21.040 --> 15:24.880
And you enter that number value, it can be several with commas, and then it will skip

15:24.880 --> 15:27.720
those packages, which is nice because I have a couple of things that do take quite a while

15:27.720 --> 15:29.080
to build that I don't need.

15:29.080 --> 15:30.080
I don't need that right now.

15:30.080 --> 15:31.080
I'll do it later.

15:31.080 --> 15:32.080
Yep.

15:32.080 --> 15:33.080
And I saw that.

15:33.080 --> 15:34.080
I like that about it as well.

15:34.080 --> 15:39.040
I'm wondering, Cheese, did you see that the Raspberry Pi Foundation has released a high

15:39.040 --> 15:43.640
quality camera and the kind of special thing about it is it has a standard camera mount

15:43.640 --> 15:44.640
as well.

15:44.640 --> 15:45.640
Did you see this sucker?

15:45.640 --> 15:46.640
You know, I didn't.

15:46.640 --> 15:49.880
It was kind of like Christmas whenever I opened up the dock and I started looking and I saw

15:49.880 --> 15:54.040
it and I was like, this is really freaking awesome.

15:54.040 --> 16:00.340
The fact that, yeah, you can add type C and CS mount lenses on it.

16:00.340 --> 16:08.840
It's 12.3 megapixel Sony sensor, which is half that of my mirrorless Sony camera, which

16:08.840 --> 16:11.000
is a 24 megapixel sensor.

16:11.000 --> 16:16.360
So I would imagine, you know, this would make for a great project where you're wanting to

16:16.360 --> 16:21.840
hook the Pi up, you know, to a camera for, I don't know, a security system or something

16:21.840 --> 16:22.840
like that.

16:22.840 --> 16:23.840
That's what I was thinking.

16:23.840 --> 16:27.400
You can also output raw, which is great, but I think it might be a little bit much for

16:27.400 --> 16:28.660
like the Pi Zero.

16:28.660 --> 16:34.240
So you may have to use something like Pi 3, Pi 4 with a little more horsepower to get

16:34.240 --> 16:36.320
full resolution out of the camera.

16:36.320 --> 16:37.320
Yeah, I think so.

16:37.320 --> 16:39.840
But it's such a cool looking little device, man.

16:39.840 --> 16:43.560
Brent, I found out about this because I was scrolling through Twitter and I started seeing

16:43.560 --> 16:49.820
these cool pictures of a farm and then I clicked on the thread and realized that they had several

16:49.820 --> 16:54.480
tripods set up where they had this with a big lens mounted on a tripod and then a tripod

16:54.480 --> 16:55.480
next to it.

16:55.480 --> 16:59.960
They had essentially a Raspberry Pi in an enclosure with a screen and a keyboard and

16:59.960 --> 17:04.440
they were taking pictures kind of using like a desktop UI on the computer.

17:04.440 --> 17:07.640
You know, I'm talking about these kinds of setups where it's like the camera is connected

17:07.640 --> 17:10.280
to the computer and the computer is actually managing the photography.

17:10.280 --> 17:11.440
We call that tethering.

17:11.440 --> 17:16.880
They're essentially tethering with this camera and I think the Sony IMX477 sensor is just

17:16.880 --> 17:19.920
a camera phone sensor, but you can put real glass on it.

17:19.920 --> 17:24.240
What I'm really interested in is something I've been dreaming about for like a decade

17:24.240 --> 17:31.120
now is could this be the beginning of open source like pro cameras?

17:31.120 --> 17:35.080
Because we haven't seen anything like that ever, but that's a dream of mine.

17:35.080 --> 17:38.080
So I wonder if this is just the very tip of the beginning of that.

17:38.080 --> 17:39.920
That would be very, very exciting.

17:39.920 --> 17:45.120
That's the exact thought I had when I looked at this setup at the farm they had there and

17:45.120 --> 17:50.500
they were basically taking some of the promo pictures for the announcement of this thing

17:50.500 --> 17:53.000
and it was a Linux desktop.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
That's wild.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
It was great.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
I'm like, wow.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.480
And I thought, you know, as crazy and hokey as this looks to have cables running between

17:59.480 --> 18:02.920
these two things and all of that, it's not beyond what a professional would do anyways.

18:02.920 --> 18:07.600
No, I know a bunch of people who they're tethering 100% of the time just because of what the

18:07.600 --> 18:11.240
computer can offer above and beyond, you know, a camera device.

18:11.240 --> 18:15.000
So it's not unheard of by any means, it's very exciting.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.320
Especially in a static set up at a studio environment where you're taking portraits

18:18.320 --> 18:19.320
of people and whatnot.

18:19.320 --> 18:21.200
I could see that'd be really, really useful.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.520
And it's a reasonable price.

18:22.520 --> 18:23.520
It's 50 bucks.

18:23.520 --> 18:24.520
Wow.

18:24.520 --> 18:25.520
Oh yeah.

18:25.520 --> 18:26.520
Yeah.

18:26.520 --> 18:27.520
The price is pretty good.

18:27.520 --> 18:28.520
It's 50 bucks.

18:28.520 --> 18:32.520
But beyond that, I was thinking too, recently I was looking at a lot to park the RV, didn't

18:32.520 --> 18:36.040
work out, but my thoughts were, wouldn't it be great to have something like this mounted

18:36.040 --> 18:43.160
on the shed that had decent optics and a couple spots and it'd be some low cost build it yourself

18:43.160 --> 18:44.160
security cam.

18:44.160 --> 18:45.160
Yeah, I was thinking that too.

18:45.160 --> 18:48.200
Or maybe even if you've got like a solar power set up, you ever seen those wildlife cameras

18:48.200 --> 18:50.760
they drop out in the woods, do that with a Pi.

18:50.760 --> 18:51.760
Absolutely.

18:51.760 --> 18:56.160
You could pretty easily get a USB-C battery on a Raspberry Pi 4 that gets charged by a

18:56.160 --> 19:01.460
solar panel and you know, as long as it could keep it running overnight, probably good.

19:01.460 --> 19:02.460
Really neat to see them doing this.

19:02.460 --> 19:04.280
Yeah, and the price is right, 50 bucks.

19:04.280 --> 19:05.920
Can't really go wrong with that.

19:05.920 --> 19:09.600
So I might end up doing this with one of my Pis.

19:09.600 --> 19:12.980
I've been waiting to do the camera thing because the camera was so low quality.

19:12.980 --> 19:17.280
It does appear that it is sold out from the three of the five vendors.

19:17.280 --> 19:20.600
So Micro Center and Canna Kit have it right now, currently.

19:20.600 --> 19:21.600
I ordered one.

19:21.600 --> 19:22.600
Oh, you got in already?

19:22.600 --> 19:23.600
I did, yes.

19:23.600 --> 19:24.600
Sneaky.

19:24.600 --> 19:28.180
I got to do it for the show, right?

19:28.180 --> 19:33.880
That's always like one of those, I'm like, am I tricking myself into buying this or am

19:33.880 --> 19:34.880
I actually going to?

19:34.880 --> 19:35.880
Yes, I'll review it.

19:35.880 --> 19:36.920
Yes, I really will review this on the show.

19:36.920 --> 19:38.380
That really will happen.

19:38.380 --> 19:39.760
Very neat to see that though.

19:39.760 --> 19:40.980
So I will have a link to that.

19:40.980 --> 19:43.880
And so when they do get back in stock, if you want one, maybe we can get like a live

19:43.880 --> 19:45.080
stream shot set up with it.

19:45.080 --> 19:46.640
I don't think it comes with the glass.

19:46.640 --> 19:48.280
So remember, you do need a lens.

19:48.280 --> 19:50.000
But wouldn't that be cool?

19:50.000 --> 19:53.180
Or like if we did like a barbecue cam with a raspberry pie?

19:53.180 --> 19:56.360
Because I have Canon lenses that would work with it, I believe.

19:56.360 --> 19:59.800
So I already got the glass, not a lot, but I got some of it.

19:59.800 --> 20:01.800
So maybe we'll give it a go.

20:01.800 --> 20:07.820
Hey, Wes, what do you say we do a little housekeeping?

20:07.820 --> 20:08.880
It's about time.

20:08.880 --> 20:11.600
So we have some things to get into.

20:11.600 --> 20:16.520
The platform for training on a Cloud Guru has now support for playgrounds where you

20:16.520 --> 20:19.280
can go run a server and check this out.

20:19.280 --> 20:21.880
Already they've added Ubuntu 2004 support.

20:21.880 --> 20:25.520
When I started Linux Academy, I was like, guys, we got to stick current with Ubuntu.

20:25.520 --> 20:27.000
We got to stick current.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.480
It's important now.

20:28.480 --> 20:29.620
And it's so cool to see that.

20:29.620 --> 20:33.680
So that's out there now if you have an a Cloud Guru or Linux Academy platform account, check

20:33.680 --> 20:34.680
that out.

20:34.680 --> 20:36.880
If you're going to learn stuff, you might as well learn on the latest and greatest.

20:36.880 --> 20:38.640
Also, I'd love to have you live.

20:38.640 --> 20:43.200
We have a great, great time with our live stream.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.200
Sometimes we hang out.

20:44.200 --> 20:47.320
We got like sometimes we're waiting for a guest or sometimes we got a technical issue.

20:47.320 --> 20:50.620
We'll hang out for a little bit and do a little millionaire or something like that on the

20:50.620 --> 20:51.620
live stream.

20:51.620 --> 20:53.320
It's really just like getting some extra show.

20:53.320 --> 20:54.320
It's extra show.

20:54.320 --> 20:55.320
Yeah.

20:55.320 --> 20:57.800
Some people will put it behind a paywall, but here we just give it away for free.

20:57.800 --> 21:03.200
jblive.tv, noon Pacific, jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar to get that converted to your

21:03.200 --> 21:04.200
local time.

21:04.200 --> 21:08.720
Now, Drew has got a little side project that I think some of you out there are going to

21:08.720 --> 21:09.720
love.

21:09.720 --> 21:11.600
Televised table reads.

21:11.600 --> 21:15.160
The first episode is live on Thursday, 8pm Eastern.

21:15.160 --> 21:16.600
And Brent will be narrating.

21:16.600 --> 21:18.240
How did he talk you into that, Brent?

21:18.240 --> 21:19.240
It's Drew.

21:19.240 --> 21:22.200
So I'll collaborate with Drew on anything pretty much.

21:22.200 --> 21:24.880
Drew rumor has it that you're in the back office.

21:24.880 --> 21:27.400
Drew, do you have anything to say for yourself back there?

21:27.400 --> 21:31.020
Yeah, this is something that I've been wanting to do for a little while with all the social

21:31.020 --> 21:32.320
distancing.

21:32.320 --> 21:35.140
You can go out and see live theater or anything.

21:35.140 --> 21:38.200
So I thought, well, I'll bring it into your living room.

21:38.200 --> 21:41.240
So we're going to do it on YouTube live.

21:41.240 --> 21:44.500
First episode, Thursday, 8pm.

21:44.500 --> 21:49.680
If you go out into the woods today by Liz Sauer, and it's really great.

21:49.680 --> 21:51.000
I'm looking forward to it.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
Good on.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.040
So that'll be Thursday, 8pm Eastern.

21:54.040 --> 21:56.960
And you can get updates at TV table reads on Twitter.

21:56.960 --> 21:58.760
I know what I'm doing on Thursday.

21:58.760 --> 21:59.760
Yeah.

21:59.760 --> 22:01.120
I mean, once Brent was in, that was all it.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.120
I'm watching.

22:02.120 --> 22:03.120
I know you guys.

22:03.120 --> 22:04.120
No pressure, Brent.

22:04.120 --> 22:05.120
No pressure.

22:05.120 --> 22:06.120
Yeah.

22:06.120 --> 22:07.120
Just don't mess it up.

22:07.120 --> 22:08.120
There's a bunch of other people collaborating.

22:08.120 --> 22:11.320
We did a little bit of a read through a few days ago, and man, did we ever have a lot

22:11.320 --> 22:12.320
of fun.

22:12.320 --> 22:18.480
So it's cool to collaborate with some really great voice actors and writers and everything.

22:18.480 --> 22:19.480
You guys practiced?

22:19.480 --> 22:20.480
We never do that.

22:20.480 --> 22:21.480
No.

22:21.480 --> 22:22.480
Wow.

22:22.480 --> 22:23.480
Okay.

22:23.480 --> 22:24.480
All right.

22:24.480 --> 22:27.480
We better up our game, Wes.

22:27.480 --> 22:32.120
Well, this Sunday, like every Sunday, there was a love plug.

22:32.120 --> 22:35.280
You hear us talk about our mumble room in our live stream, but I know it's the weekday,

22:35.280 --> 22:36.800
so it doesn't work for everybody.

22:36.800 --> 22:42.400
We do get together every Sunday, same bat time, just a different bat day at noon Pacific.

22:42.400 --> 22:46.560
Same mumble room set up, so it's a good chance to get mumble rocking, get your audio dialed

22:46.560 --> 22:47.560
in.

22:47.560 --> 22:50.120
And then if you ever could join us during the week, you already have it set to go.

22:50.120 --> 22:53.000
But if not, we're getting together every single Sunday.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.800
Man did we get into a lot last Sunday.

22:54.800 --> 22:55.800
Yeah.

22:55.800 --> 22:58.560
Just to clarify, we're just hanging out in the lobby too, so no need to get any special

22:58.560 --> 22:59.560
room.

22:59.560 --> 23:01.360
Just connect to the server and you'll hear everyone there.

23:01.360 --> 23:02.360
Yeah.

23:02.360 --> 23:04.840
You can also find details in the dedicated Geek Shed IRC room.

23:04.840 --> 23:11.520
So on the irc.geekshed.net server, there is a dedicated channel just called Luplug.

23:11.520 --> 23:13.280
You go in there and do that.

23:13.280 --> 23:18.600
Also shout out to Colonel during the lug, we were just sitting around yakking and just

23:18.600 --> 23:23.760
Logitech Trackman MarbleFX like controller, like I think it's a trackball mouse thing.

23:23.760 --> 23:28.120
It's just this crazy thing that Drew was just going on about and he's, oh man, I wish I

23:28.120 --> 23:29.120
had one.

23:29.120 --> 23:31.320
And Colonel says, hey, I got one and he's going to send it to you.

23:31.320 --> 23:32.320
Did you get it yet, Drew?

23:32.320 --> 23:33.320
I got it.

23:33.320 --> 23:34.320
Yeah.

23:34.320 --> 23:35.320
I got it just the other day.

23:35.320 --> 23:36.320
What?

23:36.320 --> 23:37.320
Yeah.

23:37.320 --> 23:38.320
I need to get a converter because it's still an old PS2.

23:38.320 --> 23:40.280
They never did release a USB version.

23:40.280 --> 23:45.000
But yeah, it's sitting on my desk waiting for that part to come in and I'll be using

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
it.

23:46.000 --> 23:51.520
He also sent a couple N95 masks over for me too, which was just super sweet.

23:51.520 --> 23:52.520
What a nice guy.

23:52.520 --> 23:53.520
Yeah.

23:53.520 --> 23:54.520
I love that Colonel.

23:54.520 --> 23:58.440
Just the incredible community connections when you can, you know, hang out with like-minded

23:58.440 --> 23:59.440
folks.

23:59.440 --> 24:00.440
It's amazing.

24:00.440 --> 24:03.000
So that'll be going on this Sunday as well.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
I experimented too.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.320
I set up my mobile mobile mobile.

24:06.320 --> 24:07.320
Yeah.

24:07.320 --> 24:10.760
So that way I could like be a moving about and joining us, you know, so that way I could,

24:10.760 --> 24:12.320
you know, be washing dishes and chatting.

24:12.320 --> 24:13.400
Who doesn't want that?

24:13.400 --> 24:14.400
Sometimes you got chores on Sunday.

24:14.400 --> 24:15.400
That's just how it goes.

24:15.400 --> 24:16.400
Sometimes.

24:16.400 --> 24:17.400
Sometimes you got to work.

24:17.400 --> 24:18.400
All right.

24:18.400 --> 24:21.040
That is the housekeeping.

24:21.040 --> 24:26.800
So this week in studio, we have the LEMUR or LEMUR or perhaps properly pronounced LEMUR.

24:26.800 --> 24:27.800
I think that's it.

24:27.800 --> 24:28.800
Yep.

24:28.800 --> 24:29.800
Thanks.

24:29.800 --> 24:30.800
Yeah, that's that confirms it.

24:30.800 --> 24:33.520
This is the LEMUR Pro from system 76.

24:33.520 --> 24:39.680
And I think the most striking thing about it is the 14 inch screen and thin lightweight

24:39.680 --> 24:40.680
aspect of it.

24:40.680 --> 24:43.780
But this unit comes in a couple of different configurations.

24:43.780 --> 24:48.680
This unit is as sent to me an i7 at 4.9 gigahertz.

24:48.680 --> 24:52.320
That's the 10 510U.

24:52.320 --> 24:53.320
What a clock speed.

24:53.320 --> 24:58.360
So it's a 10th generation and it can peak up to 4.9 gigahertz.

24:58.360 --> 24:59.360
Insane.

24:59.360 --> 25:00.360
Yeah.

25:00.360 --> 25:02.460
My brain barely comprehends that.

25:02.460 --> 25:06.040
This unit as configured shipped with 40 gigabytes of RAM.

25:06.040 --> 25:07.040
What?

25:07.040 --> 25:11.040
So it beats the new MacBook Pro 13 inch because that can only go up to 32.

25:11.040 --> 25:13.280
This goes up to 40 gigabytes.

25:13.280 --> 25:18.000
It has eight gigabytes soldered into the motherboard and then it has an additional user serviceable

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
slot.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
Whoa.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.800
That is wild in a laptop that thin.

25:21.800 --> 25:22.800
Yeah.

25:22.800 --> 25:23.800
Unheard of.

25:23.800 --> 25:29.960
Yeah, it also has two M.2 NVMe slots that you can put to storage and those are also

25:29.960 --> 25:31.480
user serviceable.

25:31.480 --> 25:36.840
This one is configured came with 500 gigabytes of M.2 storage and a 1080p matte display,

25:36.840 --> 25:37.980
which is pretty nice.

25:37.980 --> 25:41.480
And I have some pictures that are linked in the show notes if you want to see what it

25:41.480 --> 25:42.480
looks like.

25:42.480 --> 25:43.480
It is one of those.

25:43.480 --> 25:47.400
Hey, somebody in the chat room asked earlier, could you mount it to the wall like you can

25:47.400 --> 25:50.120
with a ThinkPad where it opens up completely flat.

25:50.120 --> 25:53.840
In fact, it opens up so far that it kind of even bends backwards if you want to a little

25:53.840 --> 25:54.840
bit.

25:54.840 --> 25:55.840
A little over 180 degrees.

25:55.840 --> 25:56.840
Yes.

25:56.840 --> 26:01.900
I did put a picture of that in the picture album if you want to see that.

26:01.900 --> 26:04.960
So it is that style of hinge and the hinge feels pretty sturdy.

26:04.960 --> 26:09.640
It like stays wherever you put it even when you're carrying the laptop around and whatnot.

26:09.640 --> 26:11.720
It's funny right now.

26:11.720 --> 26:16.280
It's complaining because the battery is very, very, very low.

26:16.280 --> 26:20.560
Right now with that, there it goes, as you say, with five percent, I think it's not going

26:20.560 --> 26:21.560
to last much longer.

26:21.560 --> 26:22.560
But yeah, I think it just died on me.

26:22.560 --> 26:23.560
But that's fair.

26:23.560 --> 26:24.560
We'll get into why that's fair.

26:24.560 --> 26:30.260
It absolutely should be dying on me right now because I have been punishing this battery.

26:30.260 --> 26:31.260
So I'll tell you about that.

26:31.260 --> 26:33.280
But I want to give you a little first impression information.

26:33.280 --> 26:34.560
Oh, you want to give us some juice?

26:34.560 --> 26:35.560
Yes.

26:35.560 --> 26:36.560
Yeah, why not?

26:36.560 --> 26:37.560
You could absolutely USB-C charge that thing.

26:37.560 --> 26:38.560
Gosh, I love that.

26:38.560 --> 26:41.680
It has both the barrel charger and a USB-C charger.

26:41.680 --> 26:42.680
So there you go.

26:42.680 --> 26:43.680
Good idea.

26:43.680 --> 26:44.680
We'll give it a little juice.

26:44.680 --> 26:45.680
It deserves it.

26:45.680 --> 26:47.520
So a couple of first impression items.

26:47.520 --> 26:49.080
It's an aluminum style housing.

26:49.080 --> 26:53.640
Is that actually aluminum or is it a really glossy, hard, whatever it is?

26:53.640 --> 26:58.400
It may not be aluminum or not, but it's very lightweight.

26:58.400 --> 27:00.200
And it has a backlit keyboard.

27:00.200 --> 27:05.400
And I would rate the keyboard as better than the butterfly butterfly style MacBook keyboard.

27:05.400 --> 27:06.960
Not quite ThinkPad level.

27:06.960 --> 27:07.960
That's in between.

27:07.960 --> 27:08.960
Usable.

27:08.960 --> 27:09.960
Yeah, definitely usable.

27:09.960 --> 27:12.520
Actually, on day four, my space bar started to stick a little bit, but I just sort of

27:12.520 --> 27:18.160
rapidly banged that sucker for a little bit and did the right thing and just hit on it

27:18.160 --> 27:20.400
for a bit and it fixed it.

27:20.400 --> 27:23.380
The 720p webcam is mostly fine.

27:23.380 --> 27:24.760
It's all right.

27:24.760 --> 27:27.080
People specifically wrote in a few questions, so I'm addressing those right now.

27:27.080 --> 27:29.940
Like Eddie wrote in, he said, I'm curious to hear your folks' opinion on the speaker

27:29.940 --> 27:31.960
quality of the Lemur Pro.

27:31.960 --> 27:37.080
I had a previous generation and my expectations for built-in laptops, speakers aren't high,

27:37.080 --> 27:38.920
but they were underwhelming at best.

27:38.920 --> 27:42.080
I wonder if any attention was given in the new Lemur Pro.

27:42.080 --> 27:43.080
What's your impression of it?

27:43.080 --> 27:44.380
You and I both listened to it.

27:44.380 --> 27:45.900
What's your take on the speakers?

27:45.900 --> 27:47.400
Not as bad as I expected, honestly.

27:47.400 --> 27:52.000
I mean, I think better than the ThinkPad that I've got right here.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
I'd say by a titch.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.120
Yeah, not amazing.

27:54.120 --> 27:57.960
It's not a MacBook quality speaker or anything like that, but it was listenable.

27:57.960 --> 28:03.520
It's probably just a titch better than ThinkPad, and the ThinkPads are barely listenable.

28:03.520 --> 28:05.160
You're definitely going to hear the video you're watching.

28:05.160 --> 28:07.340
You'll be able to make out the vocals just fine.

28:07.340 --> 28:11.600
It has two down firing speakers on the side, so if you have it on a hard surface, it sounds

28:11.600 --> 28:15.680
a little bit better, versus if you have it in your lap, it's a little bit harder to understand

28:15.680 --> 28:17.840
because the speakers are down firing.

28:17.840 --> 28:21.400
That's one thing to consider if you care a lot about that, but it does have a headphone

28:21.400 --> 28:24.160
jack, so you could go that route.

28:24.160 --> 28:27.720
Like I said, USB-C, it does USB 3.1.

28:27.720 --> 28:32.200
It has power delivery support, display port support, but no Thunderbolt support.

28:32.200 --> 28:35.320
Yeah, not too uncommon, I think, in this form factor.

28:35.320 --> 28:39.120
I would love to see it, though, because then you could eGPU this sucker, and that would

28:39.120 --> 28:40.120
be really, really nice.

28:40.120 --> 28:44.760
A couple other things that you'll notice after more than maybe this is your second or third

28:44.760 --> 28:49.420
impression after you've been using it for a bit, System76 advertises that this thing

28:49.420 --> 28:56.040
uses their open firmware in it, and practically speaking, I think the biggest way you notice

28:56.040 --> 28:59.460
that is unbelievable boot time.

28:59.460 --> 29:02.280
It resumes from sleep freaky fast.

29:02.280 --> 29:05.000
It boots at warp speed.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.280
I don't know how to describe it.

29:06.280 --> 29:10.760
You power it on, actually, this is how fast it boots, is I powered it on, Wes, you were

29:10.760 --> 29:12.320
sitting there, and I was like, did I get it?

29:12.320 --> 29:15.640
And we looked at it, and the OS had booted, and we were like, oh, wow, I guess I had gotten

29:15.640 --> 29:16.640
it.

29:16.640 --> 29:19.280
We were confused about what was going on, yeah.

29:19.280 --> 29:22.720
When you would expect about your screen to be lighting up for your post screen, that's

29:22.720 --> 29:24.680
pretty much when you're at the OS.

29:24.680 --> 29:28.440
And I got to say, folks at System76, Jeremy in particular, they've been really doing a

29:28.440 --> 29:29.440
ton of work.

29:29.440 --> 29:30.440
I mean, there's core boot on here.

29:30.440 --> 29:33.920
There's their own embedded controller firmware, as well as a whole bunch of other gadgets,

29:33.920 --> 29:37.120
and I think that's partly why it's just such a nice, slick experience.

29:37.120 --> 29:42.000
Right, so that kind of comes into play when you're doing the OS selection screen, and

29:42.000 --> 29:47.240
that is very simple and clean and easy to read.

29:47.240 --> 29:51.680
And then when you're doing the firmware updates, the screen that it goes to is also very easy

29:51.680 --> 29:56.120
to read, well designed, clean, and all of that is nice and smooth.

29:56.120 --> 29:58.240
So no complaints at all in that regard.

29:58.240 --> 30:02.240
And then the embedded controller firmware itself is GPL3 licensed, and what's so great

30:02.240 --> 30:07.440
about this is you combine that with the fact that this thing is 2.2 pounds, so it's the

30:07.440 --> 30:13.160
lightest weight in its class, so walking long distance carrying this thing is just no issue

30:13.160 --> 30:14.160
at all.

30:14.160 --> 30:21.200
You barely feel it in your bag, and you combine that with the super fast on aspect of it,

30:21.200 --> 30:25.680
it pretty much checks all the box that like a tablet would check too, because it's fast

30:25.680 --> 30:30.120
on, it's lightweight, it has a good keyboard, it's really something.

30:30.120 --> 30:33.800
Also nice when all these customizations is the Intel management engine has been disabled,

30:33.800 --> 30:37.600
and that's a nice little plus that you don't get from most laptop manufacturers.

30:37.600 --> 30:43.360
I think too, the other kind of still hard to get these days is the user serviceable

30:43.360 --> 30:45.560
aspect of this thing.

30:45.560 --> 30:49.680
There is 12 screws you remove from the bottom panel of this laptop.

30:49.680 --> 30:55.480
You can service the drives, you can service the CPU fan, you can easily install, in fact

30:55.480 --> 31:00.560
there's even a guide on System76 support website on how to refresh the thermal paste if you

31:00.560 --> 31:03.920
live in an area where maybe that might be necessary.

31:03.920 --> 31:06.520
And then of course the storage and the RAM and all that is very accessible.

31:06.520 --> 31:09.680
So let's talk about heat for a moment.

31:09.680 --> 31:15.280
There is the benchmark side to this, and then there is the practical day to day use of it,

31:15.280 --> 31:17.520
which I did a lot extensively.

31:17.520 --> 31:23.080
I did want to throw this sucker at some serious benchmarks, and luckily just a couple of months

31:23.080 --> 31:27.560
ago we had the most recent XPS 13 in-house.

31:27.560 --> 31:30.120
And we benchmarked that, and we had all of that on file still.

31:30.120 --> 31:36.000
So I was able to take the Lemur Pro up against the XPS 13 and see how they perform.

31:36.000 --> 31:41.960
Now there was a bit of a lead that the XPS here had because that XPS had six CPU cores,

31:41.960 --> 31:45.740
where this Lemur has four physical cores, eight threads versus 12 threads.

31:45.740 --> 31:47.360
So there's that aspect of it.

31:47.360 --> 31:53.400
Within these benchmarks, which are primarily focused around software compilation, whenever

31:53.400 --> 31:57.360
you're using something multi-core, this thing can really, really, really haul.

31:57.360 --> 32:01.160
However, when you're using something that seems to peg a single core and peg it as hard

32:01.160 --> 32:08.640
as possible, it does tend to tap out at around 2.8 gigahertz after about 15 minutes of full

32:08.640 --> 32:11.240
fledged complete hard out running.

32:11.240 --> 32:14.800
You're getting the temperatures up into the 170 degree range.

32:14.800 --> 32:19.200
At that point, the Lemur Pro doesn't seem to really bring the clock above 2.8 gigahertz.

32:19.200 --> 32:22.600
You're not reaching that 4.9 under extreme thermal load.

32:22.600 --> 32:28.080
However, if your workload is bursty or even like bursty for a couple of minutes and then

32:28.080 --> 32:33.560
drops back down, you will reach that four gigahertz level very frequently and sometimes

32:33.560 --> 32:34.560
beyond.

32:34.560 --> 32:36.600
But you will touch four gigahertz quite often.

32:36.600 --> 32:42.440
If you keep the thermals below like 165 degrees Fahrenheit, I think the highest I saw going

32:42.440 --> 32:46.160
during the benchmarks was 185 degrees Fahrenheit.

32:46.160 --> 32:49.040
At that point, the fans are not actually all that bad.

32:49.040 --> 32:50.600
I do have a take here.

32:50.600 --> 32:55.000
Keep in mind, this is actually on my phone because this is while I was at home.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.840
The phone is sitting on top of the laptop keyboard.

32:57.840 --> 33:03.400
So this is not at full out, but I explained the situation and you get idea of the noise

33:03.400 --> 33:04.400
level.

33:04.400 --> 33:06.240
Okay, welcome to the punishment zone.

33:06.240 --> 33:12.180
The microphone is right up against the laptop and what you are hearing is the laptop under

33:12.180 --> 33:16.840
fairly significant actual day to day load.

33:16.840 --> 33:21.000
Currently the CPU is clocking in at 166 degrees Fahrenheit.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.720
I did max out at 185 degrees Fahrenheit temporarily.

33:24.720 --> 33:28.880
What I'm doing now is I still have OBS going, but now I'm actually doing the screen cap

33:28.880 --> 33:30.140
for my coworker.

33:30.140 --> 33:31.880
So I also have them on a video call.

33:31.880 --> 33:38.080
I'm capturing my camera and I'm capturing a terminal window with a video loop playing

33:38.080 --> 33:43.360
behind it, a 4K video loop, I might add, and it's a 1080p canvas.

33:43.360 --> 33:49.640
I'm sending that to my coworker and I'm also monitoring that video in my own VLC window.

33:49.640 --> 33:55.160
So there's a lot happening while the video conference is going, while OBS is recording

33:55.160 --> 33:59.560
all of this to disk as a x264 file.

33:59.560 --> 34:04.820
So what I'm witnessing here, and this bears out in the benchmarks too, is the laptop really

34:04.820 --> 34:07.880
walks the line between fan noise and thermal throttling.

34:07.880 --> 34:13.960
So it will gently thermal throttle constantly around this range to keep the CPUs around

34:13.960 --> 34:14.960
this temperature.

34:14.960 --> 34:17.280
I can push it and it will let me go further.

34:17.280 --> 34:21.880
But if possible, the laptop, the firmware and the CPU all working together, try to keep

34:21.880 --> 34:25.860
the thermals and the fan noise around here.

34:25.860 --> 34:33.440
So this is about as loud as this thing gets during real life punishing use.

34:33.440 --> 34:36.480
If you don't push your laptop this hard, you won't even hear this, it stays completely

34:36.480 --> 34:37.480
silent.

34:37.480 --> 34:39.800
So that was my using it impressions of it.

34:39.800 --> 34:44.920
And I thought that was extremely reasonable because like I said, it's on the keyboard.

34:44.920 --> 34:48.280
So when you remove your head further up, it's even quieter.

34:48.280 --> 34:51.400
And Jeremy, since you've been able to join us now, I'm curious on how that firmware is

34:51.400 --> 34:55.600
walking that line because right as I received the unit, there was a firmware update that

34:55.600 --> 34:57.560
seemed to kind of adjust that curve a little bit.

34:57.560 --> 35:01.280
We wanted to maximize the wattage that we could get out of the CPU.

35:01.280 --> 35:04.200
What we're looking at is not frequency, but wattage.

35:04.200 --> 35:10.300
And the reason for that is when you're doing multi-core labor, the frequency is much lower,

35:10.300 --> 35:12.440
but the wattage is much higher.

35:12.440 --> 35:20.680
So if you have something that only uses one core, you can get up to that 4.9 gigahertz

35:20.680 --> 35:24.820
and you can stay there for a very long time and never hit thermal throttling.

35:24.820 --> 35:31.920
But of course, if you're at a multi-core workload, you can't get that high in frequency before

35:31.920 --> 35:36.000
you start to hit power limitations and thermal limitations.

35:36.000 --> 35:41.800
So we try to keep the CPU indefinitely around 20 watts.

35:41.800 --> 35:45.760
These CPUs are typically supposed to be at 15 watts.

35:45.760 --> 35:51.480
I kind of missed the comparison with the XPS 15, but I believe that they're setting their

35:51.480 --> 35:59.000
power limits at 25 watts for short term and 15 watts for long term.

35:59.000 --> 36:05.160
Ours is set at 30 watts or 35 watts and 20 watts.

36:05.160 --> 36:12.200
So we have a much higher boost when we're doing a short workload and much higher thermal

36:12.200 --> 36:16.080
output when you're doing a long term workload.

36:16.080 --> 36:21.920
And then on the fan side, we want to keep the CPU around 88 degrees.

36:21.920 --> 36:27.680
That makes the skin temperature reasonably comfortable.

36:27.680 --> 36:32.560
We don't want to burn people, but we want to get as high as possible while maintaining

36:32.560 --> 36:35.120
a skin temperature that's tolerable.

36:35.120 --> 36:42.080
So what we did is set the thermal throttling at 88 degrees and we were able to run with

36:42.080 --> 36:48.360
the fan speed that we use as the maximum fan speed indefinitely at 20 watts thermal output.

36:48.360 --> 36:53.240
It can actually go up to around 22 watts indefinitely.

36:53.240 --> 37:00.440
So the first fan curve we released was basically the same fan curve, but boosted a lot higher

37:00.440 --> 37:04.520
so it would reach 100% fan speed.

37:04.520 --> 37:10.340
And that fan is a very powerful fan, very high RPM fan.

37:10.340 --> 37:16.640
We don't need to utilize its entire range to remain performant.

37:16.640 --> 37:22.020
You'd be able to push the thing up to 25 watts, but then the skin temperature gets so high

37:22.020 --> 37:26.520
and the noise gets so high that it doesn't really make a lot of sense.

37:26.520 --> 37:33.040
So we found a nice balance, having the fan max out around 60% RPM, having the CPU throttle

37:33.040 --> 37:39.200
at around 88 degrees and having the power limit set at about 20 watts.

37:39.200 --> 37:41.200
That ended up being a really good balance.

37:41.200 --> 37:47.600
I have to agree because in my benchmark testing, I could really see that balance happening.

37:47.600 --> 37:55.280
But in my actual day-to-day, actual fairly aggressive workload where I was really trying

37:55.280 --> 38:00.320
to see what it could do, but I wasn't trying to artificially push it, it really did a good

38:00.320 --> 38:04.000
job of walking that line to the point of where most of the time I could never even hear the

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
fans.

38:05.000 --> 38:08.080
And Cheesy, to that point, I think you had a question about sort of how the thermals

38:08.080 --> 38:10.700
were monitored during the design of this thing.

38:10.700 --> 38:14.440
At the Superfan event last year, you guys had just built the isolation booth so you

38:14.440 --> 38:18.800
could measure the Thaleo fan speeds and the new fan curves.

38:18.800 --> 38:24.280
Did you put the new LEMUR in that same isolation booth to measure those fan speeds and noises?

38:24.280 --> 38:30.360
We did a few times, but the final fan curve was not developed there because, well, all

38:30.360 --> 38:35.360
of us are in our own isolation right now due to coronavirus, so...

38:35.360 --> 38:36.360
Of course.

38:36.360 --> 38:37.360
Yeah, right.

38:37.360 --> 38:43.720
The situation is, yeah, we brought the decibel meter.

38:43.720 --> 38:50.640
I have very quiet spaces here in my house, too, and we have hardware spread amongst us,

38:50.640 --> 38:57.040
so we were able to achieve the same effect without using the completely sound isolated

38:57.040 --> 38:58.040
booth.

38:58.040 --> 39:02.080
Colonel, you have a bit of a theoretical question regarding the firmware and those fan curve

39:02.080 --> 39:03.080
thresholds.

39:03.080 --> 39:07.760
Yeah, so if you guys are running a custom firmware, would you be able to expose those

39:07.760 --> 39:14.640
thermal thresholds and the fan curve algorithms to the users and make those user configurable

39:14.640 --> 39:18.400
maybe by going into the UEFI somehow?

39:18.400 --> 39:19.540
Absolutely.

39:19.540 --> 39:27.380
Right now, the configuration is completely hard-coded, but I would expect to be able

39:27.380 --> 39:33.340
to dynamically set those as part of the System76 power daemon, and we already do that on our

39:33.340 --> 39:35.480
Thaleo line for the fan curve.

39:35.480 --> 39:42.420
It's set in user space, but the important thing for me with OpenEC was that it would

39:42.420 --> 39:49.060
work regardless of the user space or kernel running on the machine, so the Lemur Pro,

39:49.060 --> 39:56.160
the firmware design, and the EC firmware, both of those are designed to be as driverless

39:56.160 --> 39:59.220
as possible, so you install...

39:59.220 --> 40:05.280
For example, on some of our other laptops, you'd need to have System76 software installed

40:05.280 --> 40:13.020
in user space to get 100% hardware support for things like keyboard backlight or the

40:13.020 --> 40:14.900
airplane mode button.

40:14.900 --> 40:24.380
In this model, everything defaults to a hardware-managed, embed controller-managed setting before being

40:24.380 --> 40:28.460
overridden by the operating system if the operating system supports overriding it.

40:28.460 --> 40:32.460
That makes sense, and that sounds like a pretty safe way to handle it.

40:32.460 --> 40:35.220
Real nice, too, if you're going to do some distro hopping and don't quite know how to

40:35.220 --> 40:36.220
set everything up right.

40:36.220 --> 40:37.340
Yeah, that's true, too.

40:37.340 --> 40:41.940
Or if you want to go to Windows, you don't have to get any drivers to install Windows.

40:41.940 --> 40:48.700
This is the only Core Boot system that has good Windows support, as far as I can tell.

40:48.700 --> 40:51.180
I hadn't thought about that old Windows OS.

40:51.180 --> 40:55.380
Because we're using UEFI as one of the things.

40:55.380 --> 40:57.860
Other Core Boot vendors, they're using something else.

40:57.860 --> 41:01.460
Chromebooks use DepthCharge as a payload.

41:01.460 --> 41:05.340
Erasm uses Heads, which uses CBIOS, I believe.

41:05.340 --> 41:12.120
So we're the only ones that are offering basically the same level of compatibility across distributions

41:12.120 --> 41:15.740
as proprietary firmware offers with this Lemur Pro.

41:15.740 --> 41:21.500
I got the sense, just by some of the positioning, but also, I don't know, maybe by the way it

41:21.500 --> 41:26.560
was sent out and whatnot, that battery life was a pretty big focus of this laptop.

41:26.560 --> 41:32.500
It's got a 73 watt-hour battery, but the focus really is on how long that 73 watt-hours last,

41:32.500 --> 41:33.500
it seems.

41:33.500 --> 41:36.620
I would of course want a bigger battery no matter what.

41:36.620 --> 41:42.540
I know some 15-inch laptops are able to fit a 99.9 watt-hour battery in there.

41:42.540 --> 41:46.920
I would love to do a 15-inch after this as a 99.9 watt-hour battery.

41:46.920 --> 41:53.620
But there are some important things, especially with 20.04, that increase the battery life

41:53.620 --> 41:55.420
significantly.

41:55.420 --> 42:01.000
You've got much better CPU frequency management with the 5.4 kernel.

42:01.000 --> 42:07.020
And you may notice that if you move between 1910 and 20.04 or move between any older distribution

42:07.020 --> 42:13.280
with an older kernel than 5.4, you'll get much longer battery life on the 5.4 kernel.

42:13.280 --> 42:19.420
Also we've done optimizations on the embedded controller side to improve power usage just

42:19.420 --> 42:21.100
at a platform level.

42:21.100 --> 42:23.580
Well it really all kind of comes together.

42:23.580 --> 42:27.940
How often do you get a machine like this just to try out?

42:27.940 --> 42:31.600
I mean I have to send it back, but it's a great opportunity.

42:31.600 --> 42:34.700
So I thought, well let's really see what I can do with this.

42:34.700 --> 42:37.940
Kind of a shaggy dog story here, but I'm a member of this program called Harvest Hosts

42:37.940 --> 42:43.740
where you can take your RV and you can stay on land at wineries and breweries and golf

42:43.740 --> 42:45.540
courses and farms.

42:45.540 --> 42:49.500
We found this local farm in the foothills of the North Cascades of Washington and it's

42:49.500 --> 42:51.740
got 580 acres of forest.

42:51.740 --> 42:52.880
Oh, beautiful.

42:52.880 --> 42:58.280
So we took the RV out there, but there's no electricity, there's no hookups, it's all

42:58.280 --> 42:59.280
off grid.

42:59.280 --> 43:03.940
There is cellular signal, but it was a no power situation.

43:03.940 --> 43:05.600
Every watt counts.

43:05.600 --> 43:10.420
And I had the Lemur with me as my weapon of choice because I needed to just get as much

43:10.420 --> 43:12.160
battery power as possible.

43:12.160 --> 43:16.540
And they have built like these log seats and workspaces.

43:16.540 --> 43:22.000
So I grabbed the Lemur and I headed out into the forest for an entire workday with just

43:22.000 --> 43:23.100
my phone and the laptop.

43:23.100 --> 43:24.740
I'm not kidding you.

43:24.740 --> 43:26.020
And I recorded a couple of thoughts.

43:26.020 --> 43:30.140
The audio is not incredible because I just had my phone with me, but I wanted to capture

43:30.140 --> 43:36.540
stuff as I was experiencing it on a laptop where every minute of battery life mattered.

43:36.540 --> 43:38.980
And I had some complicated work to do that day.

43:38.980 --> 43:42.500
I have arrived at my working spot for the day.

43:42.500 --> 43:46.260
I think this is probably about as far away as I could get from Lady Jubes and still have

43:46.260 --> 43:48.360
decent Wi-Fi performance.

43:48.360 --> 43:49.740
So I'm 100% battery right now.

43:49.740 --> 43:57.020
I kept it charged all night and we'll kick off the electron apps, the infamous electron

43:57.020 --> 44:00.540
apps and see how they do on the old battery life.

44:00.540 --> 44:02.940
I realized I sort of scheduled my day around meals.

44:02.940 --> 44:04.420
You probably knew that about me already.

44:04.420 --> 44:05.420
Yeah.

44:05.420 --> 44:09.260
But as I recorded this, I started just after I ate breakfast and then lunchtime it was,

44:09.260 --> 44:12.620
you know, time for a break and time to get down to some more complicated tasks.

44:12.620 --> 44:14.800
Well I have to say I'm impressed.

44:14.800 --> 44:21.020
It's midday right now, just after lunch and I left the screen on over lunch at my outdoor

44:21.020 --> 44:22.020
workspace.

44:22.020 --> 44:26.280
I'm perched on a log and I thought, you know, I need to do a screen cap.

44:26.280 --> 44:30.100
So I'll set up OBS and then go have a sandwich and come back.

44:30.100 --> 44:37.260
And I have the webcam going with screen cap of my terminal and a background video looping.

44:37.260 --> 44:42.780
And the CPU right now is at 135 degrees Fahrenheit, which is not bad.

44:42.780 --> 44:44.900
I've seen it get a lot higher than that.

44:44.900 --> 44:50.900
And I literally have my recorder right next to the laptop.

44:50.900 --> 44:53.660
It's closer to the laptop than it is my face and it's totally silent.

44:53.660 --> 44:57.100
I thought I'd come back and hear this fans just blasting on this thing, but what's also

44:57.100 --> 45:01.900
really impressive is the battery life is at 64%.

45:01.900 --> 45:05.100
It's estimating three hours and 59 minutes left.

45:05.100 --> 45:10.360
I also figured that OBS now wasn't recording, but it was just sitting there capturing nothing

45:10.360 --> 45:15.420
burning CPU and GPU cycles, but no, it seems quite fine.

45:15.420 --> 45:19.660
In fact, OBS is only using 10% of the CPU.

45:19.660 --> 45:25.660
So I am very impressed with the battery life.

45:25.660 --> 45:30.060
This is what I would expect from, I'm not even joking, maybe an ARM Chromebook, but

45:30.060 --> 45:33.060
this is a full fledged Linux box with OBS.

45:33.060 --> 45:36.140
So I just was sitting out here and like, you know, I need to do something for a coworker.

45:36.140 --> 45:37.140
Let me do a screen cap.

45:37.140 --> 45:40.460
At first, when I started setting up, I thought, well, I'll probably get a few hours, especially

45:40.460 --> 45:43.620
once I start launching OBS because I hadn't even installed it yet, so I had to like download

45:43.620 --> 45:44.620
the packages.

45:44.620 --> 45:47.860
But then once I got the packages installed, I'm like, well, I could tether from my phone.

45:47.860 --> 45:52.060
So I moved a little bit further away each time and I kind of felt like towards the end

45:52.060 --> 45:58.060
of it, like I was challenging myself to drain it down because the little estimator changes

45:58.060 --> 46:01.000
sort of in real time, depending on what your workload is.

46:01.000 --> 46:06.140
So I ran net data in the background to kind of capture the battery life on a longer term

46:06.140 --> 46:07.140
graph.

46:07.140 --> 46:11.940
And there, one of the things I noticed is that it has a very predictable discharge rate.

46:11.940 --> 46:16.620
It seems very consistent, like you could really kind of rely on it kind of consistency.

46:16.620 --> 46:17.620
And so then I felt safe.

46:17.620 --> 46:21.260
I mean, I know that sounds silly, but I felt safe to like, I grabbed the laptop and I just

46:21.260 --> 46:22.260
carried it.

46:22.260 --> 46:24.940
I didn't have a bag with me at the time because it's super light.

46:24.940 --> 46:28.060
And I went on for like a mile hike with the laptop and set up and kept working.

46:28.060 --> 46:30.140
It did it.

46:30.140 --> 46:32.140
It made it three meals.

46:32.140 --> 46:33.620
It's just about dinner time.

46:33.620 --> 46:37.980
It's just after six p.m. and I walked down to the river because I thought I'd finish

46:37.980 --> 46:41.220
off my day, which is about a 10 minute walk from the campground.

46:41.220 --> 46:47.780
And that is that was my moment of confidence when I realized I could walk 10 minutes away

46:47.780 --> 46:49.620
and I'll be fine.

46:49.620 --> 46:58.860
And sure enough, 30 percent left now with an average CPU load for the last hour, around

46:58.860 --> 46:59.860
20 percent.

46:59.860 --> 47:02.420
Thank you, Chrome.

47:02.420 --> 47:06.560
And it says I have two hours and nine minutes left with 30 percent power.

47:06.560 --> 47:10.700
So when I've looked at the different aspects of this laptop, the battery definitely is

47:10.700 --> 47:13.900
one of the standout top performing features.

47:13.900 --> 47:19.460
I seem to recall many system 76 reviews where we said it's a great laptop if it could just

47:19.460 --> 47:21.340
have a little more battery life.

47:21.340 --> 47:26.900
Well, I think they took all the times we asked for that and they put it all into this one

47:26.900 --> 47:28.020
laptop.

47:28.020 --> 47:31.180
It's truly exceptional here.

47:31.180 --> 47:34.140
I don't need to keep working, but I absolutely could.

47:34.140 --> 47:38.980
And what's impressive about this is certainly there were times where it was a light load.

47:38.980 --> 47:40.960
It was email and chat.

47:40.960 --> 47:46.060
But there were also times where it was pretty consistent OBS screen capture and recording

47:46.060 --> 47:47.940
and a video chat.

47:47.940 --> 47:52.260
And I also recorded an episode of the self-hosted podcast.

47:52.260 --> 47:57.240
Which includes not only a VoIP session, but also recording a local FLAC file for over

47:57.240 --> 47:59.360
an hour.

47:59.360 --> 48:04.140
And just wrapped up a bit ago and I still have, according to this, over two hours of

48:04.140 --> 48:05.140
battery life.

48:05.140 --> 48:07.420
I really couldn't ask for any more.

48:07.420 --> 48:11.140
I've had also I should mention I've had the screen cranked to 100 percent because outside

48:11.140 --> 48:15.620
it it's a matte display, so it works, but it needs a little extra support.

48:15.620 --> 48:20.660
So I cranked it, I cranked the speakers and I cranked the screen brightness and it's been

48:20.660 --> 48:22.900
like that all day long.

48:22.900 --> 48:25.980
OK, system 76.

48:25.980 --> 48:26.980
All right.

48:26.980 --> 48:27.980
You made your point.

48:27.980 --> 48:28.980
We get it.

48:28.980 --> 48:34.460
I eventually turned it down to 75 percent and then closed up, brought it back, didn't

48:34.460 --> 48:37.780
charge it, brought to the studio this morning, came back out of the woods literally this

48:37.780 --> 48:44.140
morning for the show and got here and it still had 14 percent battery life.

48:44.140 --> 48:47.060
And then it just died just a few minutes ago.

48:47.060 --> 48:48.740
It was an on and off bursty workload.

48:48.740 --> 48:50.740
I was able to carry that thing all day round.

48:50.740 --> 48:52.140
I was all day.

48:52.140 --> 48:53.140
I looked at my watch.

48:53.140 --> 48:56.360
I walked I walked a total of one point eight miles that day around the little trails and

48:56.360 --> 48:59.300
stuff like that, carrying the laptop the entire time.

48:59.300 --> 49:00.420
Very lightweight.

49:00.420 --> 49:04.100
So when you combine that battery life, which is just outrageous, it really is great in

49:04.100 --> 49:05.100
2004.

49:05.100 --> 49:07.940
I didn't really spend a lot of time with Pop OS 1910.

49:07.940 --> 49:11.820
I mostly just wanted to hop on the new.

49:11.820 --> 49:16.740
I asked them for access to the beta a little early so I could play with it.

49:16.740 --> 49:20.380
But it really seems like it's system 76 laptops at their best with this.

49:20.380 --> 49:25.860
There's been some genuine engineering to make it a pleasant experience combined with the

49:25.860 --> 49:29.700
basic ODM hardware platform getting really, really good.

49:29.700 --> 49:32.980
The all day battery life gives you tablet like confidence.

49:32.980 --> 49:36.420
And the crazy lightweight weight means you could carry it around the forest if you want.

49:36.420 --> 49:41.300
I mean, and the USB charging is really nice for flexibility because I do have a DC bank

49:41.300 --> 49:45.260
of batteries that I could charge from USB off of.

49:45.260 --> 49:48.420
So that's nice for me as somebody who's charging off of a DC source to a DC laptop.

49:48.420 --> 49:50.040
I just keep it all DC.

49:50.040 --> 49:54.260
You've still got the powerful CPUs and as much RAM as you could possibly ever need so

49:54.260 --> 49:57.100
you could really get some serious work done wherever you might be.

49:57.100 --> 50:02.500
If your workload depends on really pushing the CPU as far as it can and you're buying

50:02.500 --> 50:06.300
this because you consistently want 4.9 gigahertz.

50:06.300 --> 50:07.300
That's not going to happen.

50:07.300 --> 50:09.880
But that's also not a it's not a realistic workload.

50:09.880 --> 50:12.320
You can play it out in the benchmarks and I did that I'll link it in the show notes

50:12.320 --> 50:13.820
if you want to see the comparison.

50:13.820 --> 50:18.220
But in my in my book, that's sort of a phony test because get a server for that.

50:18.220 --> 50:19.220
What are you doing?

50:19.220 --> 50:24.580
Well, I did that test and I did I did three hours of that benchmark test on battery to

50:24.580 --> 50:26.140
see what the difference would be.

50:26.140 --> 50:28.340
I did one all plugged in one on battery.

50:28.340 --> 50:34.940
And after three hours of the laptop going full tilt GPU CPU's core is all going crazy

50:34.940 --> 50:39.880
with the screen at 100 percent brightness on it still had 24 percent battery after three

50:39.880 --> 50:40.880
hours of that.

50:40.880 --> 50:44.140
Oh, so when I saw that and I thought to myself, well, if I'm doing like a workload that's

50:44.140 --> 50:50.620
mostly web browser, electron apps, a little OBS, maybe compile a kernel here or there.

50:50.620 --> 50:53.980
I didn't do any of that on this particular workday in the forest, but I thought I had

50:53.980 --> 50:55.500
a shot at it.

50:55.500 --> 50:59.820
But what I learned is when you do more real world stuff and you don't do the synthetic

50:59.820 --> 51:03.740
benchmarking, it actually performs even better than you'd expect.

51:03.740 --> 51:06.820
And that's so I give you, you know, Jeremy, I give you some credit for that in the team

51:06.820 --> 51:11.320
there because I think you guys really figured out that real world balance in a way that

51:11.320 --> 51:15.660
is not necessarily benchmarkable, but when you use it, you definitely notice it.

51:15.660 --> 51:17.900
Jeremy, do you have any insights to share on the keyboard?

51:17.900 --> 51:19.460
I felt like it was a pretty good keyboard.

51:19.460 --> 51:22.760
It wasn't like my favorite keyboard I'd ever used, but I had no issues typing on it all

51:22.760 --> 51:23.760
day long.

51:23.760 --> 51:27.820
When we get to doing our own chassis, I think we definitely want to have the replaceable

51:27.820 --> 51:34.500
keyboard there with it being so they the depth is decreased a little bit from the Galago

51:34.500 --> 51:35.500
keyboard.

51:35.500 --> 51:38.900
I think my favorite keyboard is the Oryx keyboard.

51:38.900 --> 51:44.580
We're looking into designing desktop keyboards, and that actually part of that goes into designing

51:44.580 --> 51:50.060
laptop keyboards and designing the laptop chassis, looking into some some innovative

51:50.060 --> 51:54.020
ways to do layout and do reprogrammability.

51:54.020 --> 51:58.740
And hopefully, hopefully we come up with something better because I don't think I've ever met

51:58.740 --> 52:02.220
a laptop keyboard that I've I've really been attracted to.

52:02.220 --> 52:07.400
Anytime I'm at a desk, I want to I want to hook up an external keyboard to it.

52:07.400 --> 52:09.060
Any laptop I've ever had.

52:09.060 --> 52:11.900
Doesn't matter if it's a ThinkPad X220.

52:11.900 --> 52:17.580
I just don't believe that there's ever been a laptop keyboard that's really been comfortable

52:17.580 --> 52:21.500
to work on for an entire day if you're doing stuff like I do, programming.

52:21.500 --> 52:22.900
Well, you know what I think?

52:22.900 --> 52:26.820
I think that's just the kind of thing I want to hear a guy who's working on replacing a

52:26.820 --> 52:31.660
keyboard say because I agree that none of them are as good as they could be.

52:31.660 --> 52:38.500
I think the my T480 gets there close, but if I'm if I'm being honest with you, I'd still

52:38.500 --> 52:40.500
take a full size desktop keyboard.

52:40.500 --> 52:43.620
I mean, once you pop over to the mechanical keyboard, you're just spoiled.

52:43.620 --> 52:46.100
Yeah, I can compare, though, the lemurs.

52:46.100 --> 52:48.660
The lemurs pretty good.

52:48.660 --> 52:49.940
Compare it to the XPS 13.

52:49.940 --> 52:55.100
I actually have one of those from before I started working at System 76.

52:55.100 --> 52:59.460
And it's it's way better than the XPS 13.

52:59.460 --> 53:04.140
And of course, it blows the the MacBook 2018 out of the water.

53:04.140 --> 53:08.900
Oh, no, I haven't tried their magic keyboard, but I'm pretty sure magic.

53:08.900 --> 53:14.420
You can't just throw the magic adjective onto something that you were selling in 2010.

53:14.420 --> 53:18.220
Decide not to sell because it was too expensive and too thick.

53:18.220 --> 53:20.580
Pretty sure that's exactly how it works.

53:20.580 --> 53:22.300
I think you just nailed it.

53:22.300 --> 53:23.300
And I agree.

53:23.300 --> 53:25.300
It was a great experience.

53:25.300 --> 53:29.900
And I think it's easy to say, OK, yeah, that's not so crazy.

53:29.900 --> 53:35.020
You know, the Surface Book could get X, Y, Z or the MacBook Air can get this.

53:35.020 --> 53:42.980
But this is a fully integrated Linux solution from the vendor OS and the firmware that obviously

53:42.980 --> 53:43.980
was relevant.

53:43.980 --> 53:51.300
And I received frequent pretty close after I received the device to the nice firmware

53:51.300 --> 53:55.460
boot experience where you're choosing a boot device to the choices that were made in the

53:55.460 --> 54:00.540
fan curves and the thermal curves to just the selections in the brighter screen.

54:00.540 --> 54:05.820
And some of those aspects, plus the the nice slick System 76 and carved logo, which looks

54:05.820 --> 54:07.380
extremely nice.

54:07.380 --> 54:11.140
All of that kind of comes together with the updates in 2004, with the improvements in

54:11.140 --> 54:16.540
Pop OS, which we'll talk about next week, all kind of lands to make something that is

54:16.540 --> 54:19.820
in the past, I think, unachievable for Linux users.

54:19.820 --> 54:23.540
And now I think it's close to almost being what we should expect.

54:23.540 --> 54:27.060
At the same time, it's actually here in a real package that you can buy today.

54:27.060 --> 54:29.480
And this is one of those things where you can get this thing.

54:29.480 --> 54:31.860
You can charge it with USB-C. That's remarkable.

54:31.860 --> 54:35.420
You can hook it up to a monitor that does power pass through and essentially have a

54:35.420 --> 54:39.380
complete dock like experience with this laptop.

54:39.380 --> 54:41.900
And it'll stay quiet when you're on your conference calls.

54:41.900 --> 54:43.780
It's got a micro SD card slot in there.

54:43.780 --> 54:47.700
So when you want to download your photos, it's not a big, huge hassle.

54:47.700 --> 54:53.520
And I'm really impressed because as someone who's been buying these types of laptops over

54:53.520 --> 54:56.660
the years, you know, trying to run Linux on them or either because they came loaded that

54:56.660 --> 55:01.580
way or I loaded on there myself, I don't think I've ever had an experience quite this smooth.

55:01.580 --> 55:04.820
I for a bit, you know, jumped around.

55:04.820 --> 55:09.220
I put vanilla Ubuntu 2004 on this, ran perfectly fine.

55:09.220 --> 55:14.420
And then when I got my hands on Pop OS 2004, switched over to that.

55:14.420 --> 55:15.780
And of course, that was super smooth.

55:15.780 --> 55:16.920
The recovery environment's nice.

55:16.920 --> 55:18.980
The setup is super slick.

55:18.980 --> 55:21.380
Pop Shop and all of that we'll talk about next week is in there too.

55:21.380 --> 55:25.220
And it all comes together in quite the package, like never before seen.

55:25.220 --> 55:27.740
And I actually legitimately mean that.

55:27.740 --> 55:30.860
Really seems like quite a balance, you know, there's been there's been a lot of thought

55:30.860 --> 55:34.660
on System76 side to where this machine fits and what it's good for.

55:34.660 --> 55:38.580
And it's nice to have something that answers that all day work battery life.

55:38.580 --> 55:41.580
I mean, like I said, I put it in the bag, showed up here at the studio, still have like

55:41.580 --> 55:42.820
14% battery.

55:42.820 --> 55:44.700
And I just don't understand how that's practical.

55:44.700 --> 55:49.580
It just seems ridiculous, especially with 40 gigs of RAM in that sucker of DDR4 RAM.

55:49.580 --> 55:50.580
Also really nice to have.

55:50.580 --> 55:53.620
I don't know about everyone else, but sometimes you leave your house and you realize you didn't

55:53.620 --> 55:54.620
grab your charger.

55:54.620 --> 55:58.140
Oh, that never happens to you, Wes.

55:58.140 --> 56:01.140
Well, all right.

56:01.140 --> 56:05.420
Do check out the pictures in the show notes because it's also it's a nice looking machine

56:05.420 --> 56:06.420
as well.

56:06.420 --> 56:10.460
Can be a bit of a fingerprint magnet, but I just wipe it down, took the pictures and

56:10.460 --> 56:11.460
wipe it down.

56:11.460 --> 56:12.460
And it's not so bad.

56:12.460 --> 56:14.700
It could also be that I'm a little messy.

56:14.700 --> 56:16.620
A tip came in from Mike on audio recorder.

56:16.620 --> 56:22.580
He says regarding the conversation about recording different audio sources on your PC in episode

56:22.580 --> 56:25.580
350, you mentioned there's a GUI tool for the Mac.

56:25.580 --> 56:28.300
He says, are you aware of audio recorder for Linux?

56:28.300 --> 56:29.300
It's on Launchpad.

56:29.300 --> 56:34.780
It says it offers the capabilities you discussed and it also allows for user defined audio

56:34.780 --> 56:35.780
sources.

56:35.780 --> 56:40.020
For example, you can select both the Spotify app and your mic input if you would like to

56:40.020 --> 56:42.060
record your own karaoke session.

56:42.060 --> 56:43.700
I mean, assuming that's your thing.

56:43.700 --> 56:44.900
We did know actually.

56:44.900 --> 56:48.820
But only just recently we've been talking a little bit behind the scenes.

56:48.820 --> 56:52.800
Obviously the team is, we're all audio geeks over here and always looking for easier ways

56:52.800 --> 56:56.380
to grab clips and just quickly record audio when you don't want to get a full DAW out

56:56.380 --> 56:58.300
of the box and set up.

56:58.300 --> 56:59.700
Audio recorder is super handy.

56:59.700 --> 57:00.700
Yeah.

57:00.700 --> 57:05.060
Well, I think the Choose Linux team picked it like as a pick like forever ago.

57:05.060 --> 57:06.060
Yeah.

57:06.060 --> 57:10.580
So we kind of known internally, but we didn't really remind ourselves about it.

57:10.580 --> 57:15.220
But what I have been finding that really works well for me is it's a, I can't remember the

57:15.220 --> 57:19.860
command now, but it's an FFmpeg command, I think that takes an input audio device.

57:19.860 --> 57:20.860
Yeah.

57:20.860 --> 57:21.940
You can just choose the Pulse device.

57:21.940 --> 57:25.380
And then you just tell it to encode the FLAC or whatever you want and it just, it's a single

57:25.380 --> 57:26.380
command line.

57:26.380 --> 57:28.620
And I like that just because it's super fast.

57:28.620 --> 57:31.720
And thankfully on that system, my audio devices don't change numbers.

57:31.720 --> 57:33.620
So it's always audio device two.

57:33.620 --> 57:37.500
I think audio device one is the HDMI output on my video card.

57:37.500 --> 57:39.020
Of course it is.

57:39.020 --> 57:41.460
And then audio device two is the actual audio device I want.

57:41.460 --> 57:45.840
So I just put that into FFmpeg and it just right there on the command line.

57:45.840 --> 57:48.300
We might've put that in episode 350.

57:48.300 --> 57:49.300
I'll double check.

57:49.300 --> 57:50.300
Yeah.

57:50.300 --> 57:51.300
So that could be in there.

57:51.300 --> 57:52.380
That's worth checking out.

57:52.380 --> 57:57.420
And then another email comes in says, I'm not sure if you guys have all covered it yet,

57:57.420 --> 58:01.940
if y'all have covered it yet, but I saw the tail scale and thought you would be interested

58:01.940 --> 58:04.700
in hearing that they have hosted WireGuard as a service.

58:04.700 --> 58:11.220
It's written in Go, has an open source backend and it's made by a group of ex-Googlers.

58:11.220 --> 58:14.620
Do let us know how that goes because I would be interested in how these hosted WireGuard

58:14.620 --> 58:15.980
services go.

58:15.980 --> 58:21.140
I have expected that once it hits mainline kernels, you'd start to see them crop up.

58:21.140 --> 58:22.140
Thank you, Jason.

58:22.140 --> 58:23.780
Well, we'll have another batch next week.

58:23.780 --> 58:25.060
We're going to try to get to the feedback.

58:25.060 --> 58:26.580
We've been meaning to do it for a couple of weeks.

58:26.580 --> 58:30.420
So if you've got one, you'd like to sneak in the show and get in front of us so we can

58:30.420 --> 58:31.420
hook our peepers on it.

58:31.420 --> 58:35.820
Go to linuxunplug.com slash contact and drop it over there.

58:35.820 --> 58:36.820
There's a form there.

58:36.820 --> 58:41.240
You fill it out and then robots package it up and deliver it to Wes Payne, who takes

58:41.240 --> 58:44.060
a very discerning look at our feedback.

58:44.060 --> 58:45.380
Service you provide, Wes.

58:45.380 --> 58:46.820
Sometimes I'll even email you back.

58:46.820 --> 58:49.980
Yeah, I saw you were sneaking off a few emails before the show started.

58:49.980 --> 58:53.340
I knew that meant you were confident in the Arch upgrade, that you weren't like pre-staging.

58:53.340 --> 58:54.340
Yeah, of course.

58:54.340 --> 58:55.340
All right.

58:55.340 --> 59:01.260
Well, if you'd like to get that feedback in, like I said, linuxunplug.com slash contact,

59:01.260 --> 59:03.120
while you're over there, please subscribe.

59:03.120 --> 59:06.140
Just get the show automatically every single week.

59:06.140 --> 59:11.620
You'll also find links to guest information or links to things that we particularly covered

59:11.620 --> 59:14.820
in this particular perfect podcast.

59:14.820 --> 59:15.820
Got it.

59:15.820 --> 59:20.200
At linuxunplug.com slash 352, I was going for the triple P there.

59:20.200 --> 59:21.200
Pretty proud of that.

59:21.200 --> 59:22.500
Pretty proud of that.

59:22.500 --> 59:23.820
Thanks to Philip for joining us.

59:23.820 --> 59:24.820
Thank you, Wes.

59:24.820 --> 59:26.020
Check out Wes at TechSnap.systems.

59:26.020 --> 59:27.260
He's always rocking it over there.

59:27.260 --> 59:29.820
Thanks to Mr. Cheesy Bacon and Drew in the back office.

59:29.820 --> 59:31.960
And of course, our entire mumble room.

59:31.960 --> 59:33.860
The show is at Linux Unplugged on the Twitter.

59:33.860 --> 59:34.860
I'm at ChrisLS.

59:34.860 --> 01:00:02.140
And we'll see you next Tuesday.

01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:14.180
Before the post show proceeds, I believe we have a back office correction, real time back

01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:17.260
office correction from Drew in the control booth.

01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:21.300
Drew, pipe in from the control booth and could you update us on the mistake made at the end

01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:22.300
of the show there?

01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:23.300
Yeah.

01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:28.340
So audio recorder appears to be something different than sound recorder.

01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:29.340
Dammit.

01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:33.740
We had covered sound recorder in Choose Linux, which is a GNOME project.

01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:35.220
Slipping the table over here.

01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:36.500
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:38.020
Audio recorder looks pretty cool, though.

01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:39.020
Okay.

01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:40.020
All right.

01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:41.300
So those are two different apps to do a similar job.

01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:42.300
That's amazing.

01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:46.460
So sound recorder is the one you guys covered and audio recorder is the one that Mike wrote

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:47.460
in about.

01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:48.460
All right.

01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:50.460
So sounds like we have something else to check out.

01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:51.460
Very cool.

01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:52.460
All right.

01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:53.460
Thank you, sir.

01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:56.180
Did the mumble room have any topics that didn't make it into the main show that we wanted

01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:58.740
to cover in the post show before we get out of here?

01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:00.220
Can I talk about my GNOME frustrations?

01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:02.580
Yeah, I want to hear about a GNOME frustration.

01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:04.580
I got GNOME frustrations.

01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:10.380
Got this brand new video card, 5700 XT, should be able to work no problem because it's AMD

01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:13.820
until GNOME 3.36 comes out.

01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:20.140
What I'm dealing with is that if I'm using GNOME 3.36 on any distribution besides Fedora,

01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:24.300
my system has this issue with intermittent freezing.

01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:30.380
And I've isolated it to GNOME because I have the problem on Arch, I have the problem on

01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:36.100
Ubuntu, and I have the same problem on Debut and Unstable.

01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:39.780
So would the Fedora difference then be that Fedora is just using Wayland?

01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:41.420
It happens on Wayland and X.

01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:42.420
Oh.

01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:43.740
Yeah, that's the problem.

01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:46.740
I don't know what the difference between Fedora and all the other ones are, other than

01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:50.220
Fedora works a little bit closer with the GNOME team maybe.

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:54.220
During the freezing, do you have high SSD I.O.?

01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:55.220
No.

01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:56.700
Are you sure?

01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:57.700
Yeah.

01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:00.700
Because it happens mostly when I'm just using the web browser.

01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:03.740
Oh my friend, oh my friend.

01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:07.380
So hmm, this is interesting because I have an AMD.

01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:09.220
Mine is not nearly as nice as yours.

01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:12.060
Mine's only a 580.

01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:15.700
But this is a saga I have shared on the show before.

01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:18.180
So if you think about it, it kind of makes sense.

01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:22.100
But I ended up doing a lot of reading, got some few pointers from the audience who've

01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:24.220
also run into the same issue.

01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:30.300
And what it kind of came down to is there is a I.O. contention issue when both your

01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:35.740
disk is getting some access and your GPU is working at the same time.

01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:41.340
There is, for some of us, a lag effect that happens where it's like your entire system

01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:42.340
locks.

01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:44.700
Sometimes it just manifests as your mouse getting jumpy.

01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:46.780
Sometimes it's a full system lock.

01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:51.420
And if you're using a browser like Firefox or Chrome, they're rendering on the GPU and

01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:53.580
then they're writing the cache to your disk.

01:02:53.580 --> 01:03:00.580
And it seems to be as pathetic as the sound because, mind you, I'm doing this on a system

01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:05.380
with multiple NVMe drives and SSDs.

01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:12.560
Everything is fast as hell, 12 cores, 64 gigs of RAM, AMD 580 graphics, and I'm getting

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:16.100
these freezes, lockups, and stutters.

01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:18.860
And what I did is I got the profile, what's it called, Wes?

01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:20.860
The profile service daemon, I think?

01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:21.860
Profile sync daemon.

01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:24.060
The profile sync daemon.

01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:30.100
And what that does, as ridiculous as this sounds, is it syncs and then tricks your browser

01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:35.100
into using your cache out of RAM, which not only makes your browser noticeably faster,

01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:42.480
even on a fast system, but it removes that disk I.O. aspect and it solved my lag issue.

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:45.460
And so now I run my browser cache out of RAM.

01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:46.820
So that way I don't have this problem.

01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:48.780
It's only on that one system.

01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:53.100
I do not have the problem on any of my other Linux boxes, but I absolutely have it on that

01:03:53.100 --> 01:04:00.580
one, to the point where I nearly just went back to 16.04 because it does not happen in

01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:01.640
the Ubuntu kernel.

01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:07.180
You could test this on your system, but in the kernel in Ubuntu 16.04, it does not happen.

01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:09.260
The older kernel, something's different.

01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:14.580
It is something that started happening in the 5-series kernel going forward.

01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:20.260
MiniMech actually done a challenge of changing over to using the profile sync daemon just

01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:22.700
this week, just to see what it would run like.

01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:23.700
What do you think?

01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:28.300
I was listening to his last week talk about it, and literally during the show, using Manjaro,

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:32.100
I slapped it in in five minutes up and running, haven't done anything.

01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:33.100
It worked beautifully.

01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:41.020
Now, I use the overlay FS as well to minimize memory and to give the higher sync rate.

01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:43.820
It's worked perfect for me, but I think MiniMech has an issue.

01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:50.020
But what I was wondering for that guy who's having this issue is, could you run net data

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:54.660
and then you could see, even a couple of seconds after the phrase, you could look at your net

01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:57.620
data and see where your bottlenecks are?

01:04:57.620 --> 01:05:00.740
I tried that, just to mention it, and you may get some insights.

01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:04.620
I was actually going to suggest that too, Mollett, so that's a really good idea.

01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:09.500
But what I noticed was, I think, just a big gap in the data during that time.

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:11.100
You do experience the same problem.

01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:16.820
All of a sudden, I had the feeling that my browser was freezing, and I didn't have that

01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:17.820
before.

01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:21.820
Normally, I have my browser cache just in TempFS, and that worked pretty good.

01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:28.140
So I saw no real speed increase by changing to PSD now.

01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:33.220
But what I realized, all of a sudden, I had a web page I was visiting, all of a sudden

01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:34.700
I had that page freezing.

01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:41.020
I was not able to click the links or anything, and then all of a sudden it came back.

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:43.340
And did Profile Sync Demon solve that or not?

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:47.540
I guess the C-Mollett uses other settings.

01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:51.260
The C-Mollett uses it in overlay mode, how we told that.

01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:54.980
So I probably have to dig the settings and switch to that too.

01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:55.980
I didn't.

01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:58.260
See, for me, I did not have to use it with Overlay FS.

01:05:58.260 --> 01:06:00.260
I think it is probably better, longer term.

01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:01.980
I probably should look back at doing that.

01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:03.580
Well, I didn't have to use it.

01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:08.100
It's just, when reading through it, it said that it speeds up the sync, it makes it slightly

01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:10.500
more reliable faster, and it uses less memory.

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:11.500
So I mean, it was win-win.

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:12.500
Why wouldn't I use it?

01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:18.140
Yeah, I think I'll probably circle back, as they say in business terms, and double down

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:20.380
on that initiative going forward.

01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:24.620
But right now, my go-to-browser strategy includes just the basic setup.

01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:26.620
I'll have to revisit that decision.

01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:42.820
Well, Synergy Demon.
