WEBVTT

00:00.600 --> 00:03.120
Everybody suffers from downtime every now and then.

00:03.120 --> 00:05.220
And there was recently a major DDoS attack,

00:05.220 --> 00:07.240
and with that, we got some great fodder.

00:08.800 --> 00:11.080
Air, Azure, what is it?

00:11.080 --> 00:13.640
airsazurethrows.tumblr.com.

00:13.640 --> 00:15.360
airsazurethrows.tumblr.com.

00:15.360 --> 00:16.280
Of course it's a Tumblr.

00:16.280 --> 00:20.440
Is a collection of Azure Airs that are really great.

00:20.440 --> 00:22.040
And you know, recently I've been struggling

00:22.040 --> 00:24.520
where I have services where part of them is broken,

00:24.520 --> 00:25.960
and I've realized it because they depend

00:25.960 --> 00:27.920
on all these different various microservices

00:27.920 --> 00:29.300
that keep going offline.

00:29.300 --> 00:30.920
I'm looking at you Telegram bots.

00:30.920 --> 00:33.980
This is a great Tumblr if you want to smile.

00:33.980 --> 00:38.120
airsazurethrows.tumblr.com.

00:38.120 --> 00:40.020
This is hilarious.

00:40.900 --> 00:43.560
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 168,

00:43.560 --> 00:47.040
recorded on October 25th, 2016.

00:47.040 --> 01:00.840
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

01:00.840 --> 01:03.440
that has a real soft spot for open hardware.

01:03.440 --> 01:04.280
My name is Chris.

01:04.280 --> 01:05.120
My name is Wes.

01:05.120 --> 01:06.640
Hello, Wes, we'll be getting into a little

01:06.640 --> 01:08.600
open hardware purchase that I just made.

01:08.600 --> 01:09.840
Very excited.

01:09.840 --> 01:11.520
We'll talk about that a little bit in the show,

01:11.520 --> 01:14.080
but as is our traditional recipe these days

01:14.080 --> 01:15.720
for an unplugged show, we'll be going through

01:15.720 --> 01:17.400
some great community updates.

01:17.400 --> 01:18.960
We're gonna start with one that I'm personally

01:18.960 --> 01:20.240
super excited about.

01:20.240 --> 01:21.360
Am I not just dancing right now?

01:21.360 --> 01:23.080
Oh, you are dancing off the wall.

01:23.080 --> 01:24.680
I was totally just dancing on the intro there

01:24.680 --> 01:26.260
because I'm so excited about this.

01:26.260 --> 01:29.080
Then you've probably heard about Dirty Cow by now,

01:30.000 --> 01:32.220
but did you know it's going after your Samsungs

01:32.220 --> 01:34.880
and your Motorolas and your HD, yeah, your Android phones.

01:34.880 --> 01:35.720
It's everywhere.

01:35.720 --> 01:37.480
It's a train wreck, and we'll give you

01:37.480 --> 01:38.960
a little more specifics about Dirty Cow,

01:38.960 --> 01:40.680
and if you really need to worry if you're

01:40.680 --> 01:43.360
an up-to-date Linux user, then we'll get into archival

01:43.360 --> 01:46.240
of some of our long-term memories digitally.

01:46.240 --> 01:49.920
We'll get an update from Popeye and Wimpy

01:49.920 --> 01:52.920
about their trip to a recent event, that's right,

01:52.920 --> 01:55.840
and then we'll get into that hardware surprise.

01:55.840 --> 01:58.340
Oh, man, this is something I have been waiting for

01:58.340 --> 01:59.540
for two years.

01:59.540 --> 02:04.400
Well, yeah, waiting for this product for about two years.

02:04.400 --> 02:06.400
We have had people that have created this product

02:06.400 --> 02:08.480
on two different Jupiter broadcasting shows,

02:08.480 --> 02:10.600
and I'm gonna play an interview for you today

02:10.600 --> 02:12.320
in today's episode of Unplugged.

02:12.320 --> 02:13.840
Then I'll unveil what it is that I got.

02:13.840 --> 02:14.680
I am so excited.

02:14.680 --> 02:15.520
I'm gonna have it right here in the studio.

02:15.520 --> 02:16.340
I have no idea.

02:16.340 --> 02:17.180
Oh, I know, I know.

02:17.180 --> 02:18.520
And it actually relates to something

02:18.520 --> 02:21.320
we were just talking about in the Poe Show last week.

02:21.320 --> 02:22.440
Oh, no way.

02:22.440 --> 02:23.520
It all ties together.

02:23.520 --> 02:24.340
It all ties together.

02:24.340 --> 02:26.440
But before we can get into any of that, Wes,

02:26.440 --> 02:28.220
there's a protocol that must be followed,

02:28.220 --> 02:30.840
a duty that must be followed through on,

02:30.840 --> 02:33.080
and that's bringing in the most important part of the show,

02:33.080 --> 02:33.920
our virtual log.

02:33.920 --> 02:36.000
Time-appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

02:36.000 --> 02:36.840
Hello.

02:36.840 --> 02:37.660
Hello, it's time.

02:37.660 --> 02:38.500
Hello, good evening.

02:38.500 --> 02:39.320
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

02:39.320 --> 02:40.160
Hello.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.000
Woo!

02:41.000 --> 02:41.820
Hello.

02:41.820 --> 02:42.660
Beautiful people.

02:42.660 --> 02:45.000
That is a virtual log right there.

02:45.000 --> 02:45.840
Yes.

02:45.840 --> 02:48.040
Okay, now tell me you can't be a little excited about this.

02:48.040 --> 02:50.420
I am super excited about this.

02:50.420 --> 02:51.920
Freeablo.

02:51.920 --> 02:54.320
Freeablo, a work in progress,

02:54.320 --> 02:58.040
free open-source replacement for the Diablo 1 engine.

02:58.040 --> 02:59.820
Simply import your Diablo assets

02:59.820 --> 03:02.840
and enjoy the same old game with better performance,

03:02.840 --> 03:06.240
modern resolutions, and first-class support for mods.

03:06.240 --> 03:08.040
Is that Linux I see on the top right

03:08.040 --> 03:08.880
of your screen, Wes?

03:08.880 --> 03:09.720
Yeah, it is, buddy.

03:09.720 --> 03:10.540
No way.

03:10.540 --> 03:11.380
Yeah, it is.

03:11.380 --> 03:14.040
They love the original Diablo.

03:14.040 --> 03:15.360
In fact, they love it so much,

03:15.360 --> 03:17.240
they say they're gonna spend their precious time

03:17.240 --> 03:20.120
developing a free and open-source solution

03:20.120 --> 03:22.440
for those that wanna play it on a modern computer.

03:24.120 --> 03:24.960
I think-

03:24.960 --> 03:25.780
I'm down with that.

03:25.780 --> 03:26.760
Yeah, and they say it's legal.

03:26.760 --> 03:29.660
They won't distribute any of the copyrighted game assets.

03:29.660 --> 03:32.380
You have to have a copy of those assets to play.

03:32.380 --> 03:35.000
But everything else around it, they're gonna open-source.

03:35.000 --> 03:35.840
See, that's great.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.420
That seems like a pretty clever way to do it.

03:37.420 --> 03:39.840
Yeah, and they're working on multiplayer right now.

03:39.840 --> 03:42.080
So, I am so excited.

03:42.080 --> 03:42.920
I had not seen this.

03:42.920 --> 03:43.740
Did you find this?

03:43.740 --> 03:44.880
How did I find out about this?

03:44.880 --> 03:45.720
Good job, Wes.

03:45.720 --> 03:46.840
How did you find out about this?

03:46.840 --> 03:47.680
Where'd you see this?

03:47.680 --> 03:48.500
You know, I actually don't know,

03:48.500 --> 03:50.080
but I had it sticking in one of my open tabs.

03:50.080 --> 03:51.640
I was like, okay, this deserves to be in the show,

03:51.640 --> 03:53.600
because I had left it for myself, obviously,

03:53.600 --> 03:54.640
because I wanted to play it.

03:54.640 --> 03:57.040
Yeah, when I saw that come across the link list,

03:57.040 --> 03:59.800
I was like, yeah, yeah, we are freaking talking about that.

03:59.800 --> 04:03.240
What better way to exercise your left mouse button, right?

04:03.240 --> 04:04.340
That's true, that's true.

04:04.340 --> 04:05.660
All right, well, we did it last week,

04:05.660 --> 04:07.180
and the tradition continues this week.

04:07.180 --> 04:08.200
We're gonna open up the show

04:08.200 --> 04:10.160
with a little bit of breaking news here.

04:11.080 --> 04:14.040
This is CNN Breaking News.

04:14.040 --> 04:16.320
So, you've probably heard to death by now

04:16.320 --> 04:18.960
about the dirty cow vulnerability in Linux,

04:18.960 --> 04:22.640
the most serious Linux vulnerability quote ever.

04:22.640 --> 04:24.800
Ours said that, a few others have said that.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.360
Now it seems that Android phones

04:26.360 --> 04:28.760
are getting rooted by this vulnerability.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.720
This feels like this is where this matters.

04:30.720 --> 04:34.160
Yeah, your router, your fridge, your IP camera.

04:34.160 --> 04:37.760
But that's still pretty niche to the main consumer.

04:37.760 --> 04:39.480
Yeah, so it looks like there's a new method

04:39.480 --> 04:41.120
for rooting Android devices that's believed

04:41.120 --> 04:42.760
to work reliably on every version

04:42.760 --> 04:44.920
of the mobile operating system,

04:44.920 --> 04:46.840
and of course, a wide array of the hardware.

04:46.840 --> 04:48.800
Individuals can use it to bypass limitations

04:48.800 --> 04:51.120
imposed by manufacturers or carriers,

04:51.120 --> 04:53.080
but they can also use it to sneak apps in

04:53.080 --> 04:54.040
for malicious purposes.

04:54.040 --> 04:55.040
The technique comes courtesy

04:55.040 --> 04:58.120
of the Linux privilege escalation bug

04:58.120 --> 05:01.120
that we talked about on Linux Action Show called Dirty Cow.

05:01.120 --> 05:04.040
And so, some people are calling the vulnerability,

05:04.040 --> 05:05.160
or it goes back to kernels,

05:05.160 --> 05:07.680
the vulnerability goes back to kernels since 2007,

05:07.680 --> 05:09.480
which pretty much means every damn Android phone ever made.

05:09.480 --> 05:10.320
Right.

05:10.320 --> 05:14.040
And several independent security researchers

05:14.040 --> 05:15.280
are doing proof of concepts right now.

05:15.280 --> 05:16.720
Ours interviewed two of them.

05:18.240 --> 05:21.400
David Manchouser told Ours that the proof of concept code

05:21.400 --> 05:22.640
that exploits Dirty Cow on Android

05:22.640 --> 05:25.040
gets devices close to root.

05:25.040 --> 05:27.520
And with a few additional lines of code,

05:27.520 --> 05:29.080
he can get persistent root access

05:29.080 --> 05:32.560
on all five of Android devices he's tested.

05:32.560 --> 05:34.920
A separate security researcher asked not to be identified

05:34.920 --> 05:36.200
said that several other people

05:36.200 --> 05:38.760
have developed separate root exploits

05:38.760 --> 05:40.760
based on this Dirty Cow exploit.

05:40.760 --> 05:43.440
They say we're using a rather unique route

05:44.360 --> 05:47.280
that we believe we can use elsewhere in the future.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.120
And because of that,

05:49.120 --> 05:50.760
they don't want to tell Google about it.

05:50.760 --> 05:51.600
Oh, of course, right?

05:51.600 --> 05:53.720
Because they don't want Google shutting down the vulnerability.

05:53.720 --> 05:56.000
So they're keeping it on their own.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.200
This is bad, right?

05:58.200 --> 06:00.000
This is an example of why

06:00.000 --> 06:02.920
sure you can get your Fedora machine updated,

06:02.920 --> 06:04.360
you can get your Ubuntu machine updated

06:04.360 --> 06:06.400
and your Archbox updated.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.240
But-

06:07.240 --> 06:08.080
What are you gonna do about your Samsung phone?

06:08.080 --> 06:10.840
Joe Smith walking around with an S6 or an S5 or an S3

06:10.840 --> 06:13.040
or a Motorola X or whatever.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.160
Yep.

06:14.160 --> 06:16.400
Especially on one of our big name carriers here.

06:16.400 --> 06:17.640
Oh!

06:17.640 --> 06:18.920
She'd have to buy a new phone

06:18.920 --> 06:21.680
once there's a phone that is patched, I guess.

06:21.680 --> 06:22.520
Yeah.

06:22.520 --> 06:23.360
And I don't know,

06:23.360 --> 06:24.200
anybody in the mobile room

06:24.200 --> 06:25.280
think we're worrying too much about this stuff?

06:25.280 --> 06:28.080
Because personally, I feel like I can't overemphasize this.

06:28.080 --> 06:29.120
I feel like I'm sitting here

06:29.120 --> 06:30.600
yelling down from the mountain top.

06:30.600 --> 06:34.120
You're walking around with vulnerabilities in your pocket

06:34.120 --> 06:36.000
that could expose your personal data.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.480
A disaster is coming.

06:37.480 --> 06:38.680
A flood is coming.

06:38.680 --> 06:39.840
That's something you've been thinking about

06:39.840 --> 06:40.800
a lot personally, I think,

06:40.800 --> 06:42.680
in the last year or so.

06:42.680 --> 06:44.440
Am I overreacting?

06:44.440 --> 06:45.280
Sometimes.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.960
With the personal data thing,

06:46.960 --> 06:49.880
I feel like Android does that pretty well

06:49.880 --> 06:53.640
by just vaguely saying what an app will do with your data.

06:56.000 --> 06:56.840
Yeah.

06:56.840 --> 06:57.660
And they do have sandbox.

06:57.660 --> 06:59.120
And only once.

06:59.120 --> 06:59.960
And there is, I mean,

06:59.960 --> 07:01.280
and ours does a good job of mentioning it.

07:01.280 --> 07:03.360
You know, there is that double-edged sword

07:03.360 --> 07:05.520
of some users will benefit.

07:05.520 --> 07:07.000
I have already linked this article

07:07.000 --> 07:08.680
to some of my friends who are on phones

07:08.680 --> 07:10.480
that they've wanted to root but can't.

07:10.480 --> 07:11.320
So there are benefits.

07:11.320 --> 07:12.440
Yeah, I was thinking that too.

07:12.440 --> 07:14.600
I do also worry about that.

07:14.600 --> 07:15.440
I mean, realistically,

07:15.440 --> 07:16.800
I don't know what other people are going to do,

07:16.800 --> 07:21.020
but does it just further the bad press

07:21.020 --> 07:22.080
about the Linux kernel?

07:22.080 --> 07:24.120
Does it make other people less likely

07:24.120 --> 07:27.400
to build a similar platform using that kernel?

07:27.400 --> 07:29.560
It also makes me feel like all of those people,

07:29.560 --> 07:30.980
like the black phone,

07:30.980 --> 07:33.480
or everybody who's created these ultra-secure Android phones,

07:33.480 --> 07:35.780
there's a dozen different models right now,

07:35.780 --> 07:37.280
they're all bullshit.

07:37.280 --> 07:38.120
Because they're all walking around

07:38.120 --> 07:40.040
with this kernel vulnerability.

07:40.040 --> 07:41.640
The only phone that's legitimately safe

07:41.640 --> 07:43.280
is probably a Nexus that gets the patched in

07:43.280 --> 07:44.320
or a Pixel phone.

07:45.320 --> 07:47.160
Yeah, that's probably true.

07:47.160 --> 07:48.760
Or one that's not Android.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.680
And speaking of this,

07:50.680 --> 07:52.560
I want to give you a little more details about Dirty Cow.

07:52.560 --> 07:56.520
Also, quaintly known as CV 2016-51-95.

07:56.520 --> 07:57.660
Rolls right off the tongue.

07:57.660 --> 07:59.560
Dirty Cow, which naturally has its own logo

07:59.560 --> 08:03.080
and webpage now, which is kind of actually a funny one.

08:03.080 --> 08:03.920
It's a sign of our times.

08:03.920 --> 08:04.920
It is kind of a good one, though.

08:04.920 --> 08:07.000
They do a very good job of it, actually.

08:07.000 --> 08:07.920
It's a race condition

08:07.920 --> 08:10.200
in the kernel's memory management subsystem.

08:10.200 --> 08:11.120
By timing things right,

08:11.120 --> 08:14.220
a local attacker can exploit the copy-on-write mechanism

08:14.220 --> 08:16.160
to turn a read-only mapping of a file

08:16.160 --> 08:17.680
into a writable mapping.

08:17.680 --> 08:18.920
And then with that,

08:18.920 --> 08:21.000
a file that should not be written,

08:21.000 --> 08:21.840
you could write to,

08:21.840 --> 08:23.440
you could write to,

08:23.440 --> 08:25.060
which means change certain parameters,

08:25.060 --> 08:26.220
change the permissions,

08:26.220 --> 08:27.060
change the ownership.

08:27.060 --> 08:28.120
Secondly, I'm in the pseudoers.

08:28.120 --> 08:29.840
Yeah, it doesn't take much integrate,

08:29.840 --> 08:30.680
or I'm sorry,

08:30.680 --> 08:32.360
it doesn't really probably take much imagination

08:32.360 --> 08:34.360
to see how the ability to overwrite files

08:34.360 --> 08:37.160
could be used to escalate privilege in a number of ways.

08:37.160 --> 08:39.080
The known exploit depends on access

08:39.080 --> 08:41.480
to slash proc, slash self, slash mem,

08:41.480 --> 08:43.980
which is not universally available.

08:45.360 --> 08:47.320
Even some systems that don't provide it at all

08:47.320 --> 08:48.320
or access to it.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.280
But there are still ways to exploit the bug, potentially.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.800
The exploit happily bypasses

08:51.800 --> 08:54.160
almost every hardening technique out there.

08:54.160 --> 08:56.840
Strong sandboxing with mechanisms

08:56.840 --> 09:00.120
like seccomp might slow it down,

09:00.120 --> 09:05.120
but counting on that is probably not wise either.

09:05.600 --> 09:07.060
This is an article at LWN.

09:07.060 --> 09:08.320
The only real protection

09:08.320 --> 09:10.900
is to upgrade a kernel containing the fix.

09:10.900 --> 09:13.280
You have to upgrade with a kernel that has the fix.

09:13.280 --> 09:15.000
The workarounds aren't even all that reliable.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.800
So DirtyCow's a real son of a bitch.

09:18.120 --> 09:19.280
And it's not the only one

09:19.280 --> 09:21.120
that's being exploited on Android right now.

09:21.120 --> 09:23.680
So there is also the rowhammer vulnerability,

09:23.680 --> 09:27.520
which allows the attacker to bit flip over to root.

09:27.520 --> 09:28.960
Researchers have devised an attack

09:28.960 --> 09:30.480
that gains unfettered root access

09:30.480 --> 09:32.120
to a large number of Android phones,

09:32.120 --> 09:33.760
exploiting a relatively new type of bug

09:33.760 --> 09:36.140
that allows adversaries to manipulate data

09:36.140 --> 09:37.960
stored in the memory chips.

09:37.960 --> 09:40.200
This is actually, I believe, a vulnerability

09:40.200 --> 09:42.880
more at the CPU level than it is on the fricking OS level.

09:42.880 --> 09:43.880
The break. Yeah, it's a hardware problem.

09:43.880 --> 09:45.080
Yeah, the breakthrough has the potential

09:45.080 --> 09:46.800
to make millions of Android phones vulnerable,

09:46.800 --> 09:48.920
at least until the security fix is available,

09:48.920 --> 09:50.840
to new form of attack that seizes control

09:50.840 --> 09:53.000
of core parts of the operating system,

09:53.000 --> 09:56.020
and neuters key security defenses.

09:56.020 --> 09:56.960
Neuterism.

09:56.960 --> 09:58.360
Equally important, it demonstrates

09:58.360 --> 10:01.400
that the new class of exploit, dubbed rowhammer,

10:01.400 --> 10:03.320
can have a malicious and far-reaching effect

10:03.320 --> 10:05.420
on a much wider number of devices than previously known,

10:05.420 --> 10:08.440
including those that are on ARM.

10:08.440 --> 10:10.520
So this seems to be an issue so far

10:10.520 --> 10:14.040
tested on the Nexus 4, Nexus 5, and the G4 from LG,

10:14.040 --> 10:16.160
the Moto G models from 2013 and 2014,

10:16.160 --> 10:19.280
made by Motorola, the Galaxy S4, the S5 from Samsung,

10:19.280 --> 10:21.720
the One from OnePlus.

10:21.720 --> 10:24.920
However, not in all cases the results are consistent.

10:24.920 --> 10:28.840
Only 12 of the 15 Nexus model 5s that were tested

10:28.840 --> 10:29.960
were successfully rooted,

10:29.960 --> 10:32.960
and only one of the two Galaxy S5s were compromised.

10:32.960 --> 10:34.880
So it's something to do with the chip,

10:34.880 --> 10:38.080
and the researchers that are testing this

10:38.080 --> 10:40.440
have made an app that you can sideload

10:40.440 --> 10:42.400
to test to see if your CPU is vulnerable

10:42.400 --> 10:44.900
so they can get a wider sample base.

10:44.900 --> 10:46.600
Holy crap!

10:46.600 --> 10:48.920
And this they did tell Google in July.

10:48.920 --> 10:49.760
Well, that's good.

10:49.760 --> 10:51.440
Yeah, they say they're vulnerable at Google,

10:51.440 --> 10:53.140
so the vulnerability is critical,

10:53.140 --> 10:54.860
which is their highest rating,

10:54.860 --> 10:56.840
and have awarded the researchers four grand.

10:56.840 --> 11:00.360
So Google thinks this is a legit issue.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.200
I like that.

11:01.200 --> 11:03.440
Until recently, we never even thought about hardware bugs,

11:03.440 --> 11:05.480
and software was never written to deal with them,

11:05.480 --> 11:07.820
and there is no quick software update to patch the problem

11:07.820 --> 11:09.560
and go back to business as usual.

11:11.120 --> 11:12.240
That's a shame.

11:12.240 --> 11:14.840
I do wonder though, it's kind of making me think,

11:14.840 --> 11:17.640
I feel like we don't see the same kind of press

11:17.640 --> 11:20.760
about jailbreaking on the iOS side as we do about

11:20.760 --> 11:21.600
getting into it. That's because

11:21.600 --> 11:22.800
it's a superior system.

11:22.800 --> 11:23.640
Ah.

11:23.640 --> 11:24.800
Really, I mean, come on, let's just admit it.

11:24.800 --> 11:26.980
I mean, yeah, you can have your fanboy position,

11:26.980 --> 11:28.260
but you're right, you don't.

11:28.260 --> 11:29.880
You don't have this problem on iOS,

11:29.880 --> 11:31.560
and if you do have this problem, they patch faster,

11:31.560 --> 11:33.840
and that's a frickin' reality of the market right now.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.800
Maybe another vendor will hopefully do it better soon,

11:35.800 --> 11:37.320
but this is not what Google is good at.

11:37.320 --> 11:40.200
It's kind of the perfect example of why, you know,

11:40.200 --> 11:41.200
they do have problems on iOS,

11:41.200 --> 11:43.240
but they patch them, and you know.

11:43.240 --> 11:46.220
My hope is the Pixel fixes this particular gap.

11:46.220 --> 11:47.940
I really hope the Pixel fixes this

11:47.940 --> 11:50.160
in a way that a lot of people have.

11:50.160 --> 11:51.000
I just.

11:51.000 --> 11:51.820
You ordered one, right?

11:51.820 --> 11:52.660
Yep.

11:52.660 --> 11:54.560
Yeah, see, I really hope, man,

11:54.560 --> 11:57.120
maybe you'll be our canary, because this is bad.

11:57.120 --> 11:58.840
And be honest, you know, the other thing

11:58.840 --> 12:00.920
that really pisses me off is that comment that,

12:00.920 --> 12:03.280
well, until recently, we never considered hardware

12:03.280 --> 12:05.720
vulnerabilities and didn't design our operating system.

12:05.720 --> 12:06.980
Bullshit!

12:06.980 --> 12:08.880
What is data execution prevention?

12:08.880 --> 12:11.520
Come on, give me this, come on.

12:11.520 --> 12:13.840
Really, why did Apple design the secure enclave

12:13.840 --> 12:15.400
so that it doesn't pass any information

12:15.400 --> 12:18.160
to the underlying operating system or the ARM chipset?

12:18.160 --> 12:20.080
There's a reason they designed it like that.

12:20.080 --> 12:21.920
Of course we know of hardware vulnerabilities.

12:21.920 --> 12:24.160
X86 is filled with them.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.400
And surely ARM is as well.

12:25.400 --> 12:29.040
So just say, well, we, you know, wow.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.960
Well, especially when, no.

12:30.960 --> 12:32.880
It's like, it's like, bullcrap.

12:32.880 --> 12:34.880
And even this one has been, you know,

12:34.880 --> 12:36.960
the row hammer's been around for a while now.

12:36.960 --> 12:38.320
What do you think, Swift?

12:39.440 --> 12:41.800
I honestly think that for the most part,

12:41.800 --> 12:43.320
people can't afford the Pixel,

12:43.320 --> 12:46.280
so it's asking a lot to expect them to get it.

12:46.280 --> 12:48.560
They need this security for a cheaper phone.

12:48.560 --> 12:51.280
Yeah, I definitely agree there.

12:51.280 --> 12:53.680
What do you think, MiniMac, about the Pixel?

12:54.920 --> 12:56.360
Yeah, I would hope that the Pixel

12:56.360 --> 12:58.440
gets more than three years of support

12:58.440 --> 13:01.680
because of just these kind of vulnerabilities.

13:01.680 --> 13:04.480
I don't pay a thousand bucks for a phone

13:04.480 --> 13:06.000
only for three years,

13:06.000 --> 13:07.960
and then have these bucks coming on me

13:07.960 --> 13:10.480
and I can change anything.

13:10.480 --> 13:13.640
This is probably the number one bit of feedback we got

13:13.640 --> 13:16.280
on last week's User Air where we talked about the Pixel,

13:16.280 --> 13:18.400
and we talked about the update cycle,

13:18.400 --> 13:20.800
and so many people wrote in and said,

13:20.800 --> 13:24.240
man, everybody in my extended friends and family

13:24.240 --> 13:27.640
that is not, oh yeah, we also covered this on TechSnap.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.080
We got a bunch of emails on TechSnap.

13:29.080 --> 13:32.140
So both shows, we got a lot of people writing and say,

13:32.140 --> 13:34.760
I might update my devices more frequently,

13:34.760 --> 13:36.900
or I can't update my devices more frequently,

13:36.900 --> 13:38.600
but you know who never updates their devices

13:38.600 --> 13:40.600
is all of my friends and family who aren't tech.

13:40.600 --> 13:41.420
Exactly.

13:41.420 --> 13:42.260
People that aren't into tech.

13:42.260 --> 13:43.460
To them, an update is just an annoyance.

13:43.460 --> 13:44.300
It might break things.

13:44.300 --> 13:46.320
They update their phone when it breaks.

13:46.320 --> 13:47.880
Or you go into the store and they update it for you,

13:47.880 --> 13:49.680
or whatever.

13:49.680 --> 13:51.280
Maybe when they all die off, that'll change,

13:51.280 --> 13:53.360
but that seems to be the way people operate right now.

13:53.360 --> 13:55.280
And so these have to be five-year devices.

13:55.280 --> 13:58.680
How do we teach the next generation that updates are good,

13:58.680 --> 14:00.280
that updates are something you should do?

14:00.280 --> 14:01.320
They sure like buying things.

14:01.320 --> 14:02.160
Yeah, right.

14:02.160 --> 14:03.800
Maybe they already got it.

14:03.800 --> 14:06.120
I think the other thing that really drives me crazy

14:06.120 --> 14:11.120
about all of this is I don't accept the answer

14:11.960 --> 14:13.820
that it's not possible to update these devices

14:13.820 --> 14:15.400
for five years.

14:15.400 --> 14:20.220
That's, tell that to the banks that are running,

14:20.220 --> 14:21.360
or just Red Hat in general.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.160
I mean, they're backboarding crazy.

14:23.160 --> 14:24.880
Tell that to the servers that have been running

14:24.880 --> 14:27.060
a Red Hat distro for seven or eight years.

14:27.060 --> 14:28.780
Tell that to the banks that have mainframe

14:28.780 --> 14:30.480
still getting support by IBM

14:30.480 --> 14:32.600
that are in there for 30 years.

14:32.600 --> 14:34.560
Yeah, but Chris, to be fair,

14:34.560 --> 14:36.120
the people who are getting updates from Red Hat

14:36.120 --> 14:37.600
are paying for them.

14:37.600 --> 14:39.840
Once you've gone through the retail experience

14:39.840 --> 14:41.360
and you've walked out with a phone,

14:41.360 --> 14:44.360
you give zero money to HTC or Samsung.

14:44.360 --> 14:45.760
It all goes to Google.

14:45.760 --> 14:46.600
I would say that,

14:46.600 --> 14:48.380
but it's Google's responsibility to do the updates,

14:48.380 --> 14:49.220
not HTC.

14:49.220 --> 14:50.960
There's also no option for me to pay anyone

14:50.960 --> 14:52.240
to do that if I wanted to.

14:52.240 --> 14:53.060
I guess I...

14:53.060 --> 14:54.540
Except for those maybe value-add people.

14:54.540 --> 14:56.660
I don't see how this isn't just a technology problem.

14:56.660 --> 14:58.360
This seems like it actually, this doesn't,

14:58.360 --> 14:59.600
I guess here's what I mean,

14:59.600 --> 15:00.600
is to me, Poppy,

15:00.600 --> 15:02.920
this doesn't seem like a technology problem at all.

15:02.920 --> 15:05.720
They technically could update the software

15:05.720 --> 15:07.200
for as long as they want.

15:07.200 --> 15:09.300
I think technologically possible,

15:09.300 --> 15:10.820
they simply don't have the will

15:10.820 --> 15:12.600
from a corporate standpoint.

15:12.600 --> 15:16.160
No, I'm not suggesting it's not a technical issue.

15:16.160 --> 15:18.040
It's a purely financial one.

15:18.040 --> 15:20.680
Nobody's paying them to do it.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.560
And it's probably also easier for them to,

15:22.560 --> 15:24.400
otherwise you have to do things separately

15:24.400 --> 15:27.280
and so they can roll their features.

15:27.280 --> 15:32.280
Android 2 and devices never getting updates to...

15:32.320 --> 15:34.240
This has been the same for years and years and years

15:34.240 --> 15:35.800
that devices wouldn't get updates

15:35.800 --> 15:37.560
and it slowly got better,

15:37.560 --> 15:39.600
but it's always been the case that

15:39.600 --> 15:42.480
if you don't pay for someone to actually do the hardware

15:42.480 --> 15:44.760
enablement and do the back porting,

15:44.760 --> 15:46.440
then that, I mean,

15:46.440 --> 15:48.840
you're not getting any revenue from those customers.

15:48.840 --> 15:49.900
They've walked out the door, right?

15:49.900 --> 15:51.000
You're getting revenue from people

15:51.000 --> 15:52.180
who are buying the Pixel phones

15:52.180 --> 15:54.080
or the next phone or the next phone.

15:54.080 --> 15:55.680
You're getting nothing from those people

15:55.680 --> 15:56.880
who walked out the door three years ago.

15:56.880 --> 15:58.320
Really though?

15:58.320 --> 16:00.540
Google's not making any money off of Android users

16:00.540 --> 16:01.380
besides the hardware.

16:01.380 --> 16:02.220
So I'm not, I don't agree.

16:02.220 --> 16:04.280
HTC and Samsung and all the others are.

16:04.280 --> 16:07.480
Well, that's their, then they made a mistake

16:07.480 --> 16:10.360
shipping Android because that's a separate argument.

16:10.360 --> 16:11.720
That's a totally separate issue.

16:11.720 --> 16:14.600
The fact that they can't make money off of Android.

16:14.600 --> 16:15.800
Well, they've done pretty well off it.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.520
I'm not saying they're not making money off of it.

16:17.520 --> 16:18.760
I'm saying they're making money off,

16:18.760 --> 16:20.680
they're making continual forward revenue

16:20.680 --> 16:22.160
off the new devices they're being sold.

16:22.160 --> 16:23.520
They're not making any money off the ones

16:23.520 --> 16:24.780
that have already been shipped out.

16:24.780 --> 16:27.560
You know, Toby, I understand

16:27.560 --> 16:28.880
that they're not making money off of it.

16:28.880 --> 16:30.820
I think this is Google's responsibility.

16:30.820 --> 16:33.480
Just like Canonical can now live patch

16:33.480 --> 16:35.560
the running Ubuntu 16.04 kernels

16:35.560 --> 16:37.200
of servers all over the world.

16:37.200 --> 16:40.240
I don't see why Google couldn't live patch Android handsets.

16:40.240 --> 16:42.880
Why, the technology is there.

16:42.880 --> 16:44.160
It's a possibility.

16:44.160 --> 16:45.740
They just simply don't have the will

16:45.740 --> 16:47.280
or the corporate contracts

16:47.280 --> 16:49.160
or the bureaucratic structure to enable it,

16:49.160 --> 16:51.000
but yet they still have the nuts

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
to sell these devices to consumers

16:53.000 --> 16:55.560
and literally put their personal lives at risk.

16:55.560 --> 16:58.280
It seems like a total disconnect to me.

16:58.280 --> 16:59.640
Right, and I agree with you.

16:59.640 --> 17:00.960
You know, I go to a store,

17:00.960 --> 17:03.520
if you went to a Verizon store and bought a device,

17:03.520 --> 17:05.200
my contract is with Verizon.

17:05.200 --> 17:08.120
That's who I made the retail purchase with.

17:08.120 --> 17:08.960
I understand, right.

17:08.960 --> 17:10.720
If Google reached into my phone

17:10.720 --> 17:13.040
and flipped some bits on my phone,

17:13.040 --> 17:15.360
I would be pretty angry as Verizon

17:15.360 --> 17:17.560
that Google are reaching into devices

17:17.560 --> 17:18.560
and screwing this up.

17:18.560 --> 17:20.760
I think that is an old argument.

17:20.760 --> 17:22.640
The carriers have to test the devices

17:22.640 --> 17:24.280
to make sure they work on the network,

17:24.280 --> 17:26.940
but yet there are hundreds of millions of iPhones

17:26.940 --> 17:28.600
receiving updates directly from Apple,

17:28.600 --> 17:31.080
and there are tens of millions of Android devices

17:31.080 --> 17:34.020
running CyanogenMod, and the carriers don't have any.

17:34.020 --> 17:36.640
How many hardware, how many different hardware devices

17:36.640 --> 17:39.440
are there that Apple support, like right now?

17:39.440 --> 17:40.520
Not that many.

17:40.520 --> 17:42.880
Look at how many different devices there are

17:42.880 --> 17:45.360
that even one manufacturer, Samsung, has.

17:45.360 --> 17:48.480
Look at the range of devices that one manufacturer has.

17:48.480 --> 17:50.360
It's a completely different ball game,

17:50.360 --> 17:53.020
Android devices than Apple devices.

17:54.180 --> 17:55.020
That is true.

17:55.020 --> 17:55.880
Although I wonder if something like that

17:55.880 --> 17:58.560
could be fixed with like an SLA type agreement

17:58.560 --> 17:59.600
between Google and Verizon.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.460
You know, if they do cause Verizon real problems,

18:01.460 --> 18:03.200
support calls increase by a certain amount

18:03.200 --> 18:05.140
on these supported phones with upgrades.

18:05.140 --> 18:07.980
You could have business arrangements around that.

18:07.980 --> 18:09.240
All right, well I wanna give other people a chance

18:09.240 --> 18:10.960
to jump in and kind of push back a bit too,

18:10.960 --> 18:12.280
cause I know people have been tagging me.

18:12.280 --> 18:15.920
Mosinrath, you had a comment about shipping Android,

18:15.920 --> 18:17.320
about going with Android and not making any money.

18:17.320 --> 18:18.920
Go ahead.

18:18.920 --> 18:21.320
Yeah, just like a lot of people have been saying in there,

18:21.320 --> 18:24.780
such as Demerit, and I believe Sweet Lou has also

18:24.780 --> 18:28.160
made the point, you're gonna wanna get to him on it as well.

18:28.160 --> 18:30.500
Swift 110 also made a statement about that.

18:31.680 --> 18:34.680
You gotta take a look at, with Apple, as you see,

18:34.680 --> 18:35.880
they have the enclosed garden set up,

18:35.880 --> 18:38.240
so they're making money off of the software,

18:38.240 --> 18:40.280
the hardware, you even thinking about it,

18:40.280 --> 18:41.360
they're making money off of it.

18:41.360 --> 18:43.400
The fact that you even used the word Apple,

18:43.400 --> 18:46.240
yes, somehow they were in your pocket already.

18:46.240 --> 18:51.140
But with say Samsung and HTC and all those other companies,

18:51.140 --> 18:54.480
they ship the product, you're buying the hardware from them,

18:54.480 --> 18:57.120
and as was stated, I believe it was by Popeye

18:57.120 --> 18:59.960
a couple moments ago, that's it for them.

18:59.960 --> 19:02.640
Yeah, well is that fair though,

19:02.640 --> 19:06.840
because Samsung's charging $800 for a Note 7,

19:06.840 --> 19:10.400
the Pixel, if you want a decent one, is $750,

19:10.400 --> 19:13.280
the 6P is an expensive device,

19:13.280 --> 19:15.480
they seem to be making a shit ton of money,

19:15.480 --> 19:18.600
the device hardware costs as much, if not more,

19:18.600 --> 19:20.640
in the case of Samsung, as an iPhone.

19:21.560 --> 19:24.120
Yeah, but as a lot of people have stated,

19:24.120 --> 19:27.440
they make the money off of you once, that's it.

19:27.440 --> 19:29.920
That's the only cash they get from you,

19:29.920 --> 19:32.000
so of course they're gonna try to get as much as possible

19:32.000 --> 19:34.240
in order to develop the next product.

19:34.240 --> 19:36.920
After that, they don't get any more money from you.

19:36.920 --> 19:39.480
Well, Samsung doesn't, but Google,

19:39.480 --> 19:41.800
Google's constantly monetizing the Android platform.

19:41.800 --> 19:42.640
That's why they made it.

19:42.640 --> 19:45.560
Yes, but that's Google that's monetizing the platform.

19:45.560 --> 19:47.880
I think that's who should be developing the updates too.

19:47.880 --> 19:50.300
But Google can't develop the updates,

19:50.300 --> 19:52.240
because there's no cooperation between them

19:52.240 --> 19:53.760
and the hardware manufacturers,

19:53.760 --> 19:54.760
because the hardware manufacturers

19:54.760 --> 19:56.640
keep the source to themselves.

19:56.640 --> 19:57.480
That's why.

19:57.480 --> 19:59.180
Well, that's not always,

19:59.180 --> 20:00.900
it actually works the other way.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.960
Google hold back Android updates

20:02.960 --> 20:05.080
from handset manufacturers as well.

20:05.080 --> 20:07.360
So Google will hold back the latest version of Android,

20:07.360 --> 20:09.320
so they can ship it on their own devices

20:09.320 --> 20:11.800
before it goes out to Samsung, HTC,

20:11.800 --> 20:14.440
even the tier one handset manufacturers

20:14.440 --> 20:16.960
don't get it as fast as Google get it themselves.

20:16.960 --> 20:18.520
This is why the Pixel's a thing now.

20:18.520 --> 20:19.340
I mean-

20:19.340 --> 20:21.720
The only one with that Google Smart Assistant, guys.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.120
Sorry, it just cracks me up.

20:24.120 --> 20:26.160
Yeah, the only way to get it.

20:27.060 --> 20:28.200
But I think it just tells you,

20:28.200 --> 20:30.240
it just shows you that even Google themselves

20:30.240 --> 20:31.760
recognize this is a core issue.

20:31.760 --> 20:33.640
This disconnect between the carriers,

20:33.640 --> 20:36.240
the handset manufacturers and Google.

20:36.240 --> 20:38.440
It is not a great ecosystem.

20:38.440 --> 20:40.120
Yeah, it is not a great ecosystem.

20:40.120 --> 20:41.960
And everybody's paying patent fees

20:41.960 --> 20:43.920
to Microsoft that gets in it.

20:43.920 --> 20:45.500
Everybody's getting screwed at all ends,

20:45.500 --> 20:47.400
and Google's the only one making money.

20:49.360 --> 20:51.240
Samsung was, but.

20:51.240 --> 20:52.800
All right, so does anybody else,

20:52.800 --> 20:53.640
tag me again in the moment

20:53.640 --> 20:55.640
if anybody else wants to jump in before we move on.

20:55.640 --> 20:58.440
I think what I feel is I understand,

20:58.440 --> 21:00.400
I understand how the business relationships

21:00.400 --> 21:01.240
are structured today.

21:01.240 --> 21:02.320
I understand how the source code

21:02.320 --> 21:04.280
dumps over the fence work from Google.

21:04.280 --> 21:06.920
I understand how monetization works of these devices

21:06.920 --> 21:08.280
and how they make their money,

21:08.280 --> 21:10.400
and how the carriers wanna add their layer on top of it.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.780
I get all of that, and I ask you,

21:12.780 --> 21:14.760
if you were an alien traveling from Mars

21:14.760 --> 21:16.520
and you arrived here and you looked at the situation,

21:16.520 --> 21:18.480
would you not think this is a dumb arrangement?

21:18.480 --> 21:21.720
And say, well, the only thing that makes it this way

21:21.720 --> 21:23.080
is the artificial constructs

21:23.080 --> 21:25.440
that you hairless monkeys have set up to do this.

21:25.440 --> 21:27.080
And if you just simply did it differently,

21:27.080 --> 21:27.920
it would be better.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.160
And it would literally be better for consumers.

21:30.160 --> 21:32.400
It would protect their privacy better.

21:32.400 --> 21:33.360
Mr. Swift, go ahead.

21:34.440 --> 21:36.840
The fact that they don't protect people's privacy

21:36.840 --> 21:39.600
is something that's gonna become a larger issue over time.

21:39.600 --> 21:42.120
And I mean, if you just have an affordable way

21:42.120 --> 21:44.960
to protect people and show that you respect them,

21:44.960 --> 21:47.000
I think you'll make more over the long term

21:47.000 --> 21:49.680
versus trying to grab, grab, grab in the short term

21:49.680 --> 21:51.000
and charge all this money,

21:51.000 --> 21:52.280
but you're not providing them

21:52.280 --> 21:55.160
with the kind of comfort that they deserve.

21:55.160 --> 21:57.560
Right, like you might need that to change the market.

21:57.560 --> 21:59.040
Yeah, they're in their walled garden

21:59.040 --> 22:01.000
and they feel safe and secure there.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.720
If you can offer the same thing in the free software

22:03.720 --> 22:06.320
or with regards to the phones,

22:06.320 --> 22:08.000
then you'll be in a much better spot.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Yeah, and in fact,

22:09.000 --> 22:10.480
WW, that's kind of what you're thinking, right?

22:10.480 --> 22:12.720
I mean, geez, don't we hope that this is where free software

22:12.720 --> 22:14.400
could really help us?

22:14.400 --> 22:17.040
Yeah, because if you think about it,

22:17.040 --> 22:19.440
console game developers, to put it,

22:19.440 --> 22:21.520
to situate it kind of like that,

22:21.520 --> 22:24.640
when you see an update on that, it's paid for.

22:24.640 --> 22:27.440
The software development is paid for

22:27.440 --> 22:30.560
and they pay for the actual update process

22:30.560 --> 22:32.840
to get it on that hardware

22:32.840 --> 22:34.560
and to be tested on that hardware

22:34.560 --> 22:36.840
and whatever licensing fees.

22:36.840 --> 22:38.320
And that kind of sucks.

22:38.320 --> 22:41.320
Where on PC you can do whatever.

22:41.320 --> 22:44.800
So I'm really hoping that with Ubuntu phone,

22:44.800 --> 22:47.280
and maybe Poppy or would be good answer,

22:47.280 --> 22:49.120
that's that, or maybe Poppy,

22:49.120 --> 22:50.600
that would it be open?

22:50.600 --> 22:54.200
So like, if you're a developer, you can solve these issues,

22:54.200 --> 22:56.640
you can contribute to Ubuntu phone OS

22:56.640 --> 23:00.560
and make it better without having to wait

23:00.560 --> 23:01.400
and all that stuff.

23:01.400 --> 23:03.280
Because as I see it now,

23:03.280 --> 23:05.720
the only way this will be ever solved

23:05.720 --> 23:07.520
is having an open system

23:07.520 --> 23:10.320
where things could be more rapidly patched out.

23:10.320 --> 23:12.600
Right, WW, when we were talking about,

23:12.600 --> 23:14.080
well, it doesn't make HTC any money

23:14.080 --> 23:15.920
to update these devices, in the back of my head,

23:15.920 --> 23:17.760
I'm thinking, that's never been an issue

23:17.760 --> 23:18.960
for Linux development.

23:20.680 --> 23:22.840
No, you're right, it hasn't.

23:22.840 --> 23:26.120
We've developed and people have put in their-

23:26.120 --> 23:29.840
It's like the community can solve this problem.

23:29.840 --> 23:31.760
And that would be Ubuntu phones advantage, right?

23:31.760 --> 23:32.600
Yeah, maybe.

23:33.560 --> 23:34.960
May I add something in here?

23:34.960 --> 23:36.560
Yeah.

23:36.560 --> 23:40.400
So what I know is that manufacturers like Qualcomm

23:40.400 --> 23:44.680
and others, they only build devices for the Android platform.

23:44.680 --> 23:48.680
So the device is not open, they ship their own drivers.

23:48.680 --> 23:51.600
So you can't just build a Linux infrastructure

23:51.600 --> 23:53.720
and put Ubuntu phone on it.

23:53.720 --> 23:57.040
That's why Ubuntu phone and Sailfish is based on Android

23:57.040 --> 23:59.760
because all these phones only run Android.

23:59.760 --> 24:03.920
So it's not as easy as WW thinks.

24:03.920 --> 24:05.120
Okay, fair point.

24:05.120 --> 24:06.640
Yeah, I have noticed that.

24:06.640 --> 24:09.240
And that is probably a fair point.

24:09.240 --> 24:11.600
With the Linux development point you just made,

24:11.600 --> 24:13.040
the difference with Linux is

24:14.160 --> 24:16.160
the people who are doing these patches

24:16.160 --> 24:18.760
are working for companies that want the code

24:18.760 --> 24:20.880
because it helps them.

24:20.880 --> 24:22.720
With Android, it's just being done by the companies

24:22.720 --> 24:23.760
to help support the device

24:23.760 --> 24:25.720
and then they'll gain money after that.

24:26.760 --> 24:28.560
So I guess we need Google with its deep pockets

24:28.560 --> 24:30.960
to step up and incentivize these carriers

24:30.960 --> 24:34.480
or when hardware manufacturers to consent to updates.

24:34.480 --> 24:38.520
Or as a market, the Pixel phone needs to be successful enough

24:38.520 --> 24:40.680
that it forces the market to react.

24:40.680 --> 24:41.680
And that might be what happens.

24:41.680 --> 24:43.840
Or we just keep having these horrible problems

24:43.840 --> 24:45.480
and enough that the platform is at risk.

24:45.480 --> 24:47.160
Yeah, and like Sweetloo points out too,

24:47.160 --> 24:49.080
not everybody can afford these latest and greatest phones

24:49.080 --> 24:50.480
which also puts them at security risk.

24:50.480 --> 24:51.800
I wanna address that in just a second.

24:51.800 --> 24:54.920
But before I forget, I wanted to mention

24:54.920 --> 24:58.800
that I got a note from the developer

24:58.800 --> 25:00.360
of the tool we talked about last week

25:00.360 --> 25:01.560
called the Magic Device Tool.

25:01.560 --> 25:02.400
Oh, really?

25:02.400 --> 25:05.000
That allows you to install Ubuntu or Cyanogen

25:05.000 --> 25:07.840
or Phoenix OS or Android on your device.

25:07.840 --> 25:08.800
And I made the mistake,

25:08.800 --> 25:10.480
because I think I misread this,

25:11.880 --> 25:14.360
yeah, I misread this article.

25:14.360 --> 25:16.640
He actually does support the Google Apps.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.000
He's like, hey, thanks for the coverage,

25:18.000 --> 25:19.400
but by the way, we do support the Google Apps.

25:19.400 --> 25:20.240
Hey, even better.

25:20.240 --> 25:21.080
Yeah.

25:21.080 --> 25:21.920
That's great.

25:21.920 --> 25:23.440
Thank you for writing this to tell us.

25:23.440 --> 25:24.280
Yeah, it was really nice.

25:24.280 --> 25:25.480
And so what a cool tool.

25:25.480 --> 25:28.000
And it's called, again, it's called the Magic Device Tool.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.040
And it allows you to deploy

25:29.040 --> 25:31.120
the latest Ubuntu Touch release, Cyanogen mod,

25:31.120 --> 25:32.720
with or without the Google Apps,

25:32.720 --> 25:35.840
and the factory Android app image, like a backup,

25:35.840 --> 25:39.040
including Phoenix OS on the BQ line of devices,

25:39.040 --> 25:40.080
pretty much all of them that matter,

25:40.080 --> 25:44.440
including the tablets, the Nexus 5, the Nexus 7 2013.

25:44.440 --> 25:46.940
Yeah, which is, a lot of us have that one

25:46.940 --> 25:48.080
with nothing to do with it.

25:48.080 --> 25:52.000
Also the 2012 Nexus 7, Samsung Nexus 10,

25:52.000 --> 25:55.400
which is a great tablet, and the OnePlus One,

25:55.400 --> 25:57.720
and the Fairphone 2 are all supported

25:57.720 --> 25:59.280
by the Magic Device Tool.

25:59.280 --> 26:01.080
So it's also just a nice way to create backups

26:01.080 --> 26:02.080
to restore your device.

26:02.080 --> 26:06.520
And it's nice that Ubuntu Touch is a top-supported option.

26:06.520 --> 26:08.440
So basically, I bring this up

26:08.440 --> 26:11.240
because if this is something that you've been chewing on,

26:11.240 --> 26:12.480
because it's something I've been thinking about,

26:12.480 --> 26:14.040
like Wes mentioned for a while,

26:14.040 --> 26:18.240
I kind of feel like this is at least,

26:18.240 --> 26:20.640
my boat is now on the beachhead and I have options.

26:20.640 --> 26:23.960
And once the 6P is added to that list, if it ever is,

26:23.960 --> 26:25.400
that'll be the day.

26:25.400 --> 26:26.240
The day, yeah.

26:26.240 --> 26:27.240
Yep.

26:27.240 --> 26:29.400
I really, I'm really hoping I could.

26:29.400 --> 26:30.240
That'd be a great device for it.

26:30.240 --> 26:33.440
Oh my God, if I could ever, ever run Ubuntu Touch

26:33.440 --> 26:37.240
on the 6P, I would be so happy.

26:37.240 --> 26:39.080
Because I mean, I am willing maybe one day

26:39.080 --> 26:41.960
to just get like an MX Pro type device.

26:41.960 --> 26:43.760
Oh man, I would love it on the 6P.

26:43.760 --> 26:45.200
Because I don't mind the 6P hardware.

26:45.200 --> 26:47.840
It's a little big, a little heavy, but the core is nice.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.200
Great screen, great battery.

26:49.200 --> 26:51.440
And if you hold it real still, it takes a good picture.

26:51.440 --> 26:54.360
So that may be something that happens.

26:54.360 --> 26:57.040
And the Nexus devices you can pick up for super cheap too

26:57.040 --> 26:59.440
if you want to play with Ubuntu Touch.

26:59.440 --> 27:01.640
You know, there is another component

27:02.600 --> 27:06.840
that is sort of something we have to attack from both ends.

27:06.840 --> 27:08.520
And that's the carrier side of this.

27:08.520 --> 27:10.040
Because they're a bunch of bastards

27:10.040 --> 27:11.280
in this entire thing too.

27:11.280 --> 27:13.440
So let's take a moment and mention our sponsor,

27:13.440 --> 27:14.920
which is a carrier that does this differently

27:14.920 --> 27:15.960
and does it right.

27:15.960 --> 27:17.400
Go to linux.ting.com.

27:17.400 --> 27:18.880
They don't get in the way of your updates.

27:18.880 --> 27:21.120
They don't have like a ting experience

27:21.120 --> 27:24.360
that they have to develop and integrate into the image.

27:24.360 --> 27:25.720
They don't put their bloatware on their apps

27:25.720 --> 27:26.840
because they don't have any bloatware.

27:26.840 --> 27:28.880
They don't like prevent you from updating

27:28.880 --> 27:30.440
over the wireless if you want.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.640
Like this just simple wireless.

27:32.640 --> 27:34.920
You pay for what you use, minutes, messages, and megabytes.

27:34.920 --> 27:36.720
You pay for each for what you use.

27:36.720 --> 27:38.800
So if you don't text a lot, you don't pay for any texting.

27:38.800 --> 27:40.360
If you don't call a lot, you don't pay for any calls.

27:40.360 --> 27:41.840
If you don't use a lot of data, you don't pay for data.

27:41.840 --> 27:44.040
When you use it, you do pay and it all averages out.

27:44.040 --> 27:47.200
You go to linux.ting.com to get $25 off your first device

27:47.200 --> 27:49.640
or $25 in service credit if you bring a device,

27:49.640 --> 27:52.200
which will pay for more than your first month likely

27:52.200 --> 27:53.440
if you average it out.

27:53.440 --> 27:54.560
This is something that's really nice

27:54.560 --> 27:55.880
because there's no contracts.

27:55.880 --> 27:57.600
There's no early termination fee.

27:57.600 --> 27:59.160
The devices are unlocked.

27:59.160 --> 28:00.680
They're not locked to Ting.

28:00.680 --> 28:02.080
You can move them around if you want,

28:02.080 --> 28:04.520
which makes it really nice to bring devices to.

28:04.520 --> 28:08.120
When you do need help, you just talk to a person,

28:08.120 --> 28:10.760
not a phone tree, but a person.

28:10.760 --> 28:12.640
You don't have to press zero like seven times.

28:12.640 --> 28:15.680
You don't hit mash it, ma'am, ma'am, yeah.

28:15.680 --> 28:17.240
And they have CDMA and GSM,

28:17.240 --> 28:19.680
which I know outside the US,

28:19.680 --> 28:21.280
that's not very common to use CDMA,

28:21.280 --> 28:23.080
but in the States with at least-

28:23.080 --> 28:23.920
We just love it.

28:23.920 --> 28:25.760
Well, especially on the West where you have,

28:25.760 --> 28:28.000
we have the Rockies, there's a ton of trees.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.520
CDMA has some serious advantages.

28:30.520 --> 28:33.640
And you know, GSM has been absolutely rock solid

28:33.640 --> 28:36.240
for me as well, so it's really nice to have both options.

28:36.240 --> 28:37.800
So you can get a little bit of a taste of it

28:37.800 --> 28:39.200
by going to linux.ting.com.

28:39.200 --> 28:42.540
And then speaking, addressing Sweet Lou's point,

28:43.600 --> 28:46.480
speaking of flagship-type devices

28:46.480 --> 28:48.220
that aren't super expensive,

28:49.360 --> 28:51.080
yesterday Ting just put up a blog post

28:51.080 --> 28:53.240
about five inexpensive smartphones

28:53.240 --> 28:55.400
with flagship performance.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.840
It was brilliant.

28:56.840 --> 28:59.040
So you can go get an unlocked phone

28:59.040 --> 29:01.720
with great performance, with no contract,

29:01.720 --> 29:04.760
$6 for the line, and you pay for what you use.

29:04.760 --> 29:07.200
And you can read the blog by going to linux.ting.com

29:07.200 --> 29:09.000
and then click on their blog link.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.520
I think this is kind of, it's just a sort of end,

29:11.520 --> 29:13.240
bookend our conversation.

29:13.240 --> 29:16.720
This is a huge part of that entire formula.

29:16.720 --> 29:18.100
Yes, it is.

29:18.100 --> 29:20.400
Yeah, I really, if I could give you,

29:20.400 --> 29:21.260
if you could afford it,

29:21.260 --> 29:22.920
and I could give you one recommendation

29:22.920 --> 29:26.040
about how to be secure with your mobile device,

29:26.040 --> 29:28.120
get a device from the Play Store

29:28.120 --> 29:29.360
and put it on the Ting network.

29:29.360 --> 29:31.120
Yep, it's expensive, but you're right,

29:31.120 --> 29:32.720
like that's probably the best option.

29:32.720 --> 29:34.120
You can go this route too, you know,

29:34.120 --> 29:35.700
and if these devices are getting updated

29:35.700 --> 29:38.600
by their manufacturers, Ting will not interfere with that.

29:38.600 --> 29:40.400
And so go read the devices they've listed here

29:40.400 --> 29:42.680
because the prices are like under 300 bucks,

29:42.680 --> 29:44.020
except for the OnePlus 3.

29:44.020 --> 29:47.240
But you know, there's really some serious options

29:47.240 --> 29:49.440
like the Huawei, is that how you say it?

29:49.440 --> 29:50.280
Hawaii?

29:50.280 --> 29:53.360
Huawei, the Honor 5X, 199.

29:53.360 --> 29:55.560
The 5X, the 5X, still a great phone.

29:55.560 --> 29:56.600
I mean, it would be a big upgrade

29:56.600 --> 29:57.440
for what this has got right now.

29:57.440 --> 29:58.520
Yes, it would.

29:58.520 --> 30:01.160
In fact, you know what I love about Ting,

30:01.160 --> 30:03.080
this is from their blog right here.

30:03.080 --> 30:05.000
Here at Ting, we don't want to pressure you

30:05.000 --> 30:07.080
to buy a phone from the Ting shop.

30:07.080 --> 30:09.200
There's lots of special deals online

30:09.200 --> 30:11.400
and we recommend that you take a look around.

30:11.400 --> 30:12.440
Just by waiting a few months

30:12.440 --> 30:13.640
and doing a bit of online research,

30:13.640 --> 30:15.140
you can get all the smartphone you need

30:15.140 --> 30:16.700
at a much smarter price.

30:18.480 --> 30:21.080
That is so plainly written

30:21.080 --> 30:23.360
and it is so refreshing to hear that

30:23.360 --> 30:24.280
from a mobile phone carrier.

30:24.280 --> 30:27.240
They're not trying to create a giant vertical monopoly.

30:27.240 --> 30:28.460
They just want you to use their service

30:28.460 --> 30:29.520
because it's good.

30:29.520 --> 30:31.160
They give you the couple of tips you need

30:31.160 --> 30:32.360
to go do a little searching.

30:32.360 --> 30:34.000
They link you to the Ting compatibility checker

30:34.000 --> 30:35.880
to make it even easier.

30:35.880 --> 30:37.320
They say over 80% of the phones made

30:37.320 --> 30:39.840
in the last few years are compatible with Ting.

30:39.840 --> 30:40.680
Wow.

30:40.680 --> 30:41.500
There you go.

30:41.500 --> 30:43.840
I think this is such a refreshing take on this.

30:43.840 --> 30:45.780
So get started by going to linux.ting.com.

30:45.780 --> 30:46.620
That gives you the discount,

30:46.620 --> 30:48.500
but also lets them know you heard about it right here

30:48.500 --> 30:49.880
on the unplugged program.

30:49.880 --> 30:52.260
And right there in the middle, what would you save?

30:52.260 --> 30:53.160
Just experiment with that.

30:53.160 --> 30:54.000
That's fun.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.520
And consider like if you made a couple of changes,

30:55.520 --> 30:59.160
say you marked your music to play offline

30:59.160 --> 31:01.560
and you download your podcast over Wi-Fi,

31:01.560 --> 31:04.360
how much data would you use when you're commuting

31:04.360 --> 31:05.200
if you did that?

31:05.200 --> 31:06.680
And if you switched to Ting

31:06.680 --> 31:08.840
and you made those two adjustments,

31:08.840 --> 31:10.440
how much could you save?

31:10.440 --> 31:11.280
Check it out.

31:11.280 --> 31:14.320
Go to linux.ting.com and a big thanks to Ting

31:14.320 --> 31:17.520
for sponsoring the unplugged program.

31:17.520 --> 31:22.520
So Wes, there was this post about the X, Z,

31:23.280 --> 31:24.120
is that how you say it?

31:24.120 --> 31:24.960
Yeah, X, Z.

31:24.960 --> 31:26.520
X, Z is the X, Z form.

31:26.520 --> 31:27.360
It's only two letters.

31:27.360 --> 31:28.640
It seems like we could say them.

31:28.640 --> 31:31.120
I know, but I don't know if it's Z or X, Z.

31:31.120 --> 31:31.960
I actually don't know.

31:31.960 --> 31:33.960
I think I always say X, Z, but I'm probably wrong.

31:33.960 --> 31:35.000
Yeah, well, it doesn't really matter

31:35.000 --> 31:39.840
because there's a post over at nonganoo.org that says,

31:41.200 --> 31:43.040
so we can't just let that go by, right?

31:43.040 --> 31:46.400
It's nonganoo.org, nonganoo.org.

31:46.400 --> 31:48.800
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

31:48.800 --> 31:52.640
They say that the X, Z format is inadequate

31:52.640 --> 31:54.320
for long-term archiving.

31:54.320 --> 31:56.040
I think this entire post is bullshit,

31:56.040 --> 31:57.760
but I was kind of curious what you thought about it

31:57.760 --> 31:59.120
because you were the one that found this link.

31:59.120 --> 32:01.800
And then I wanted to kind of roll this into

32:01.800 --> 32:04.120
a slightly larger conversation with our mumble room

32:04.120 --> 32:07.440
about what they do for their long-term data archival needs

32:07.440 --> 32:11.200
because, and I know a couple of them in there are parents,

32:11.200 --> 32:13.320
couple of them in there probably have keepsakes

32:13.320 --> 32:16.240
that they want to have forever, videos, things like that.

32:16.240 --> 32:19.880
The idea of like, before, I feel like a lot of people

32:19.880 --> 32:20.720
had kind of discovered, right?

32:20.720 --> 32:22.720
You had like pictures that you found in your garage

32:22.720 --> 32:24.360
or your parents' attic or something.

32:24.360 --> 32:25.920
You're like, oh, I have these from when I was a kid,

32:25.920 --> 32:27.520
but if it's on a hard drive,

32:27.520 --> 32:29.200
that is not the same in the digital age.

32:29.200 --> 32:30.720
God, that is such a good analogy.

32:30.720 --> 32:33.600
So I have photo albums from my childhood

32:33.600 --> 32:34.440
that my mom gave me.

32:34.440 --> 32:36.280
She's like, here, these are yours to hang onto now.

32:36.280 --> 32:39.400
And once every 15 years or whatever,

32:39.400 --> 32:41.040
I've opened them up and I'm like, holy crap,

32:41.040 --> 32:42.640
remember when we had chickens?

32:42.640 --> 32:44.200
Remember when we cut a hole in the side of the house

32:44.200 --> 32:45.020
and put a window in?

32:45.020 --> 32:45.860
That's so neat.

32:45.860 --> 32:47.160
I'll look through it and I'm like, this is really great.

32:47.160 --> 32:48.800
And maybe one day my kids,

32:48.800 --> 32:50.880
like I've gone through my dad's photo album

32:50.880 --> 32:51.960
and I found that to be fascinating.

32:51.960 --> 32:53.120
Wow, look at my dad as a kid.

32:53.120 --> 32:53.960
He looks like a kid.

32:53.960 --> 32:54.800
Totally.

32:54.800 --> 32:55.640
My dad's just a kid.

32:55.640 --> 32:56.460
Those are good memories, right?

32:56.460 --> 32:57.300
You get to experience that.

32:57.300 --> 32:58.440
Nothing like that.

32:58.440 --> 33:01.200
There's no book my kids are gonna go grab of them

33:02.160 --> 33:03.880
because it's all on a hard drive.

33:03.880 --> 33:05.480
Or it's in some cloud account

33:05.480 --> 33:06.320
they don't have access to.

33:06.320 --> 33:07.480
And I'm gonna be honest with you,

33:07.480 --> 33:10.200
this is one of the reasons I sacrifice

33:10.200 --> 33:13.800
every sacred freedom and privacy aspect I have

33:13.800 --> 33:15.760
by uploading all my photos to Google Photo

33:15.760 --> 33:18.000
because I'm just desperate to have

33:18.000 --> 33:19.480
some sort of long-term archival

33:19.480 --> 33:21.420
so that way when my kids are 15,

33:21.420 --> 33:23.960
I can look at them when they were four and five

33:23.960 --> 33:25.520
and remember what that was like.

33:25.520 --> 33:27.000
I don't wanna not have that.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.440
So I keep trying to think, well, how can I do this

33:29.440 --> 33:33.680
where I control the data, I have a good archival system,

33:33.680 --> 33:36.600
and it is, I guess I want the digital equivalent

33:36.600 --> 33:39.000
of a photo album or other things like it.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.120
And I'm kinda curious what your thoughts were

33:41.120 --> 33:42.020
before we get to that.

33:42.020 --> 33:42.860
Yes.

33:42.860 --> 33:44.600
What are your thoughts about this particular article

33:44.600 --> 33:47.000
about how the XZ format's a bastard

33:47.000 --> 33:50.200
and shouldn't be used because of checksums?

33:50.200 --> 33:54.520
Well, one, I think the Savannah, the non-GNU website,

33:54.520 --> 33:55.800
they support free software.

33:55.800 --> 33:57.200
I don't know their long history,

33:57.200 --> 33:58.880
but I know they support free software,

33:58.880 --> 34:01.280
but they're not associated

34:01.280 --> 34:02.440
with the Free Software Foundation,

34:02.440 --> 34:04.160
which as we've discussed on the show,

34:04.160 --> 34:05.280
you can love them or hate them,

34:05.280 --> 34:06.920
but they definitely have an ideology.

34:06.920 --> 34:08.920
Zombies don't run Linux.

34:08.920 --> 34:10.460
Exactly.

34:10.460 --> 34:12.120
So this is, fair disclosure,

34:12.120 --> 34:14.880
this is written by the author of the LZIP tool,

34:14.880 --> 34:16.920
which is kind of a competing tool to XZ.

34:16.920 --> 34:20.400
They both use the LZMA compression algorithm,

34:20.400 --> 34:22.540
which let's see, that's a fun one.

34:22.540 --> 34:23.860
What is it?

34:23.860 --> 34:24.700
Oh, LZ.

34:24.700 --> 34:26.720
ZIV Markov Chain Algorithm.

34:26.720 --> 34:28.920
LZ is great because it's not the best compression ever,

34:28.920 --> 34:31.160
but it's great speed, works great on a file system level.

34:31.160 --> 34:33.400
I've used it in combination with ButterFS in the past.

34:33.400 --> 34:34.720
Sure, yeah, yeah.

34:34.720 --> 34:36.920
And so this XZ also implements that.

34:36.920 --> 34:39.240
That's what it uses to compress files inside,

34:39.240 --> 34:42.360
but it also implements its own container format.

34:42.360 --> 34:44.400
And so this blog post,

34:44.400 --> 34:45.360
there are some things where I think

34:45.360 --> 34:46.800
that for the majority of use cases,

34:46.800 --> 34:48.040
it doesn't really matter.

34:49.600 --> 34:51.600
One big thing I think that did kind of ring true

34:51.600 --> 34:54.280
is they talk about how it doesn't support garbage data

34:54.280 --> 34:56.800
after the end of the file, that sort of thing,

34:56.800 --> 34:59.000
where I think if you were gonna do things

34:59.000 --> 35:01.280
with tape style backups, that sort of stuff,

35:01.280 --> 35:02.840
there may be some validity.

35:02.840 --> 35:05.060
I think there are also some things

35:05.060 --> 35:06.840
that generally ring true

35:06.840 --> 35:08.760
and are good design principles here

35:08.760 --> 35:11.160
about you want to keep things simple,

35:11.160 --> 35:12.600
you can over-engineer things.

35:12.600 --> 35:14.040
There are some plausible arguments here

35:14.040 --> 35:16.080
about how XZ may be over-engineered,

35:16.080 --> 35:17.720
especially for the most common use cases.

35:17.720 --> 35:19.040
Here's why I feel like the argument

35:19.040 --> 35:22.880
that using XZ for backup in archival is bad.

35:22.880 --> 35:25.100
The reason why it's bogus, he hangs his hat

35:25.100 --> 35:27.440
on things like checksums and whatnot not being built in,

35:27.440 --> 35:29.360
but there are so many other tools

35:29.360 --> 35:31.440
that if you just use the Unix philosophy,

35:31.440 --> 35:35.760
if you use SHA256SUM and PAR2,

35:35.760 --> 35:38.160
there's ways you can do this

35:38.160 --> 35:40.980
and supplement the deficiencies of XZ

35:40.980 --> 35:44.160
that are just built-in tool chains on the Linux system.

35:44.160 --> 35:46.880
Right, I think that's exactly.

35:46.880 --> 35:48.440
But I wonder, does anybody in the Mamba room,

35:48.440 --> 35:51.760
so InagoGo, Mr. GoGo, you just made a great point.

35:51.760 --> 35:56.280
You said, in fact, speaking of you, your thing is next,

35:56.280 --> 36:00.040
but Mr. GoGo, you had a, I forget what it was,

36:00.040 --> 36:03.200
but you combine TarSnap with something else

36:03.200 --> 36:05.200
and that this is your solution?

36:05.200 --> 36:06.840
Well, I don't use it though.

36:06.840 --> 36:08.760
I guess forward being an interesting way of doing it.

36:08.760 --> 36:11.800
Using a free NAS to do ZFS stuff

36:11.800 --> 36:14.000
and then doing, putting some of the stuff

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
you want to keep onto TarSnap

36:16.000 --> 36:17.840
and then also having a photo album

36:17.840 --> 36:20.040
just in case any of those two fail.

36:20.040 --> 36:22.120
But that's not, yeah, that is a great way

36:22.120 --> 36:23.720
to protect the data.

36:23.720 --> 36:26.560
But I don't feel like it,

36:26.560 --> 36:30.040
it doesn't have that accessibility that I'm looking for

36:30.040 --> 36:32.160
that a generation from now,

36:32.160 --> 36:34.360
when I'm not there to tell them how to get access to it,

36:34.360 --> 36:36.680
I'm not there to provide them the login,

36:36.680 --> 36:38.960
but I want them to have access to it.

36:38.960 --> 36:42.100
That's what the physical photo album for.

36:42.100 --> 36:42.940
Print them out.

36:42.940 --> 36:43.760
Mosinrath, what do you think?

36:43.760 --> 36:46.720
Is there a digital way to do this with like, this?

36:48.280 --> 36:49.120
Probably not.

36:49.120 --> 36:51.400
Like we've been discussing it in the chat room here

36:51.400 --> 36:53.880
in terms of like how long things will last and all that.

36:53.880 --> 36:56.040
But as you can see by my last comment

36:56.040 --> 36:57.320
and what other people have said,

36:57.320 --> 36:59.780
it's like, I dare you to try to use your free NAS

36:59.780 --> 37:01.440
when there's a power outage.

37:01.440 --> 37:02.280
Go ahead.

37:02.280 --> 37:03.200
Let's see you do it.

37:03.200 --> 37:04.300
You can't.

37:04.300 --> 37:06.500
And therefore that physical media,

37:06.500 --> 37:08.440
even though it is going to fade,

37:08.440 --> 37:10.560
no matter what it is that you do,

37:11.560 --> 37:13.240
is still the best one.

37:13.240 --> 37:16.120
Like I got a pile of pictures and a couple of photo albums.

37:16.120 --> 37:19.000
I'm looking at them right now, right?

37:19.000 --> 37:21.800
I don't have those in any kind of digitized format.

37:21.800 --> 37:24.400
I had them at one point in time, scanned them all,

37:24.400 --> 37:26.360
lost them all because I formatted the wrong disk.

37:26.360 --> 37:27.200
Oh, wait a second.

37:27.200 --> 37:28.760
You could do that just about anywhere,

37:28.760 --> 37:30.760
any place, any time, couldn't you?

37:30.760 --> 37:33.640
Because there's no such thing as a setup,

37:33.640 --> 37:34.920
as far as I know,

37:34.920 --> 37:38.320
that if you can access it to put stuff in,

37:38.320 --> 37:41.400
that you cannot access it and wipe things out.

37:41.400 --> 37:42.440
Right, and something that you know

37:42.440 --> 37:44.960
they're going to have access to generations later.

37:44.960 --> 37:49.240
A kind of like TechMav's solution is create a dead man switch.

37:49.240 --> 37:52.960
So maybe once you stop punching the button every few years,

37:52.960 --> 37:55.280
it automatically delivers the login credentials

37:55.280 --> 37:56.640
and a URL to your kids.

37:56.640 --> 37:58.400
Yeah, that would be pretty neat.

37:58.400 --> 37:59.240
You know what?

37:59.240 --> 38:00.240
Let's punt this to the listeners

38:00.240 --> 38:01.760
that are listening after the fact,

38:01.760 --> 38:02.680
and let us know.

38:02.680 --> 38:04.000
Comment wherever you're catching this

38:04.000 --> 38:07.260
or wherever you prefer to comment or email or tweet,

38:07.260 --> 38:09.560
and let me know what you would do for this.

38:09.560 --> 38:12.120
And I obviously want it to be Linux based.

38:12.120 --> 38:13.640
Right, I mean, open source, right?

38:13.640 --> 38:15.800
I mean, you need things that you can,

38:15.800 --> 38:17.800
if you need to do something 20 years,

38:17.800 --> 38:19.000
100 years from now that you can.

38:19.000 --> 38:19.880
Really, seriously?

38:19.880 --> 38:21.120
Yeah, that's a key thing.

38:21.120 --> 38:23.440
Because that way you could send the code along with the files.

38:23.440 --> 38:26.520
So Mr. Gogo, was it in the post-show last week

38:26.520 --> 38:29.120
that I was talking about how I'd love to have analog meters

38:29.120 --> 38:31.040
to represent my CPU usage?

38:31.040 --> 38:32.320
I think it was in the pre-show.

38:32.320 --> 38:33.740
Pre-show, okay.

38:33.740 --> 38:37.400
So after talking about it on the unplugged program,

38:39.200 --> 38:41.800
Mr. Inagogo submitted this to the subreddit,

38:41.800 --> 38:45.120
a video where he's connected a VU,

38:45.120 --> 38:46.960
or I think it's a voltage meter, I think,

38:46.960 --> 38:50.080
connected over USB to his laptop.

38:50.080 --> 38:53.080
And you can see he's got Gnome system monitor running here,

38:53.080 --> 38:56.040
and the CPU load that's in Gnome system monitor

38:56.040 --> 38:59.160
is translated to this volt meter's analog dial.

38:59.160 --> 39:01.400
Have I described this correctly so far?

39:01.400 --> 39:02.240
Kind of.

39:02.240 --> 39:03.080
Okay.

39:03.080 --> 39:05.960
The Gnome system monitor was just me demonstrating

39:05.960 --> 39:08.680
that it's quite accurate to where it's pointing.

39:08.680 --> 39:09.720
Sure.

39:09.720 --> 39:12.840
But there's an Arduino sitting between the laptop

39:12.840 --> 39:16.840
and the volt meter, which is having data sent

39:16.840 --> 39:20.160
from the laptop by a Python script,

39:20.160 --> 39:23.560
which then turns that into a PWM signal

39:23.560 --> 39:25.260
that changes where the needle is.

39:26.440 --> 39:28.440
WW says it needs more Nixie tubes.

39:28.440 --> 39:29.960
This is pretty awesome, though.

39:29.960 --> 39:31.760
I'll be honest with you, when I saw this,

39:31.760 --> 39:33.040
the first thing I thought to myself was,

39:33.040 --> 39:35.440
God, I'd love to have some bigger versions

39:35.440 --> 39:39.000
of these mounted on the wall by the main broadcast machines,

39:39.000 --> 39:40.880
the OBS machine and the Wirecast machine,

39:40.880 --> 39:42.240
and be able to have these analog dials.

39:42.240 --> 39:44.040
So I knew how hard these systems were working.

39:44.040 --> 39:46.200
I would love to have these as props in the studio

39:46.200 --> 39:48.600
and also actual useful readouts.

39:48.600 --> 39:50.880
How long did it take you to do this?

39:50.880 --> 39:53.520
A day, after getting the VU meter.

39:53.520 --> 39:54.840
Ha ha ha!

39:54.840 --> 39:55.720
That is so cool.

39:55.720 --> 39:57.440
And then you put the code up on GitHub to do it

39:57.440 --> 39:58.960
so other people can play, too.

39:58.960 --> 40:00.060
See, the other thing this makes me think of

40:00.060 --> 40:01.140
is like cloud stuff.

40:01.140 --> 40:02.120
Like what if you got your dropout

40:02.120 --> 40:03.720
that's running the server for your people?

40:03.720 --> 40:05.960
You want to see like any random metric

40:05.960 --> 40:06.880
that you just kind of want.

40:06.880 --> 40:07.720
Is that a thing?

40:07.720 --> 40:08.920
Could you do that?

40:08.920 --> 40:10.440
I mean, if you can make a time series data,

40:10.440 --> 40:11.600
I don't see why not.

40:11.600 --> 40:14.440
So you could have like your fricking droplet CPU load

40:14.440 --> 40:15.920
represented with a V with a little...

40:15.920 --> 40:17.980
I mean, there'd be a lot more intermediate steps,

40:17.980 --> 40:18.820
of course, but...

40:18.820 --> 40:20.660
That is so cool, Wes.

40:21.680 --> 40:25.120
Man, as the sysadmin in me wants that for all the things.

40:25.120 --> 40:26.560
Or like load average over the fleet.

40:26.560 --> 40:28.560
Like, wouldn't it be great for like the different SATCOMs

40:28.560 --> 40:30.000
to know how hard the different SATCOMs

40:30.000 --> 40:31.240
are working right now for us?

40:31.240 --> 40:33.400
Or what's your, yeah, throughput on your bandwidth?

40:33.400 --> 40:34.640
What's the, yeah.

40:34.640 --> 40:37.240
Oh, you could do, oh, you could, oh, oh, man.

40:37.240 --> 40:38.880
It's Delta Flyer B2.

40:38.880 --> 40:40.080
So here's what we need.

40:40.080 --> 40:43.080
Now let's, I need Mr. Gogo and others.

40:43.080 --> 40:44.720
I need you to come to the JB1 studio

40:44.720 --> 40:46.840
and we need to spend two days out here.

40:46.840 --> 40:48.700
I'll film the whole thing.

40:48.700 --> 40:50.080
You guys build these things

40:50.080 --> 40:51.440
and we'll make an episode out of it.

40:51.440 --> 40:52.280
We need to do this.

40:52.280 --> 40:53.240
That sounds amazing.

40:53.240 --> 40:55.280
I think that is so awesome.

40:55.280 --> 40:56.900
That is, gosh, that's cool.

40:56.900 --> 40:57.840
All right, well, we gotta keep moving

40:57.840 --> 40:58.680
because this is the longest episode ever.

40:58.680 --> 41:00.160
This is a big show, yeah, right?

41:00.160 --> 41:03.760
So I wanted to give a chance to chat with Mr. Popey

41:03.760 --> 41:05.440
and I wanted to take a chance to chat with Mr. Wimpy

41:05.440 --> 41:07.920
about a recent event they went to

41:07.920 --> 41:11.340
and it's not too uncommon, I think,

41:11.340 --> 41:14.920
but maybe just to recap, we could kind of set the stage.

41:14.920 --> 41:17.120
Here, there's these events that Canonical holds

41:17.120 --> 41:18.880
from time to time where they bring their team

41:18.880 --> 41:20.120
or different members together

41:20.120 --> 41:21.520
and they focus on a few things

41:21.520 --> 41:24.240
and they say, let's really focus on development

41:24.240 --> 41:25.160
in this area right now.

41:25.160 --> 41:27.720
We have a distributed team all over the world

41:27.720 --> 41:31.040
and we're gonna leverage having all of them in one space

41:31.040 --> 41:32.320
for a short period of time.

41:32.320 --> 41:34.680
There's gonna be a hyper level of productivity

41:34.680 --> 41:36.360
and we're all gonna walk away with this

41:36.360 --> 41:37.560
with sort of a shared picture,

41:37.560 --> 41:39.880
a shared idea of what the next set of goals are

41:39.880 --> 41:42.040
and a lot of things often get produced here

41:42.040 --> 41:43.360
but they don't often get discussed.

41:43.360 --> 41:46.040
People don't realize that this is happening.

41:46.040 --> 41:47.160
I don't know, guys, how am I doing so far?

41:47.160 --> 41:48.760
Have I kind of set up with the general premises

41:48.760 --> 41:50.000
of what these events are?

41:51.160 --> 41:52.440
Kind of, it depends.

41:52.440 --> 41:55.500
Some of them are development sprints

41:55.500 --> 41:57.760
where the developers get together

41:57.760 --> 41:59.380
and actually hack on stuff.

41:59.380 --> 42:01.040
Others are planning sprints

42:01.040 --> 42:02.740
where there's loads of meetings and discussion

42:02.740 --> 42:05.200
and this was more of a planning than a hacking sprint.

42:05.200 --> 42:07.120
Oh, cool, so you can break them out.

42:07.120 --> 42:07.960
Some hacking.

42:07.960 --> 42:08.800
That's brilliant.

42:08.800 --> 42:10.660
Yeah, well, we have sprints all the time.

42:10.660 --> 42:12.600
There was one the week before we were there,

42:12.600 --> 42:13.720
there's another one this week

42:13.720 --> 42:15.340
and there'll be another one the week after

42:15.340 --> 42:16.400
but with different teams.

42:16.400 --> 42:18.800
So the one that we went to last week,

42:18.800 --> 42:20.640
both myself and Martin went,

42:20.640 --> 42:24.400
was in the Netherlands in The Hague

42:24.400 --> 42:28.960
and there was 200 and something people there,

42:28.960 --> 42:30.340
250 people there.

42:30.340 --> 42:33.340
All from Canonical or where?

42:33.340 --> 42:35.820
No, there was mostly Canonical people.

42:35.820 --> 42:38.940
So design team, desktop team,

42:38.940 --> 42:41.600
Snappy team, community team,

42:41.600 --> 42:44.300
and others who I don't recall.

42:44.300 --> 42:45.140
Unity 8 team, Mere team.

42:45.140 --> 42:47.500
Unity 8 team, Mere team, yes, well done.

42:48.380 --> 42:49.860
And like loads of other people

42:49.860 --> 42:51.420
who I've never seen before

42:51.420 --> 42:53.780
and also there were some community people there

42:53.780 --> 42:57.260
as in non-Canonical people there as well

42:57.260 --> 42:58.860
who were invited.

42:58.860 --> 43:01.180
But it was mostly meetings.

43:01.180 --> 43:04.580
There was a room we had set aside for hacking

43:04.580 --> 43:07.180
because the Snappy team were working hard

43:07.180 --> 43:08.900
on getting a release out the door

43:08.900 --> 43:10.540
and the release candidate was last week

43:10.540 --> 43:11.500
while they were there

43:11.500 --> 43:14.300
and the final release is this or next week.

43:14.300 --> 43:16.900
And so they were hacking but mostly it was meetings.

43:18.260 --> 43:22.060
And I imagine that for a company

43:22.060 --> 43:23.660
that is sort of dispersed,

43:23.660 --> 43:24.860
I mean, I understand there's offices,

43:24.860 --> 43:28.900
but for a company that has a very dispersed workforce,

43:28.900 --> 43:30.780
it seems like these would be pretty essential

43:30.780 --> 43:32.760
to getting everybody that's working

43:32.760 --> 43:34.520
on this particular thing on the same page.

43:34.520 --> 43:36.160
So even if it's not developing code,

43:36.160 --> 43:37.000
you're getting everybody to-

43:37.000 --> 43:37.980
Making it feel like a team.

43:37.980 --> 43:39.340
You're buying it on the idea.

43:39.340 --> 43:40.400
Is that accurate?

43:41.400 --> 43:43.460
Yeah, it's very much that.

43:43.460 --> 43:47.820
I mean, everyone like regularly meets up anyway online.

43:47.820 --> 43:50.540
We all use Hangouts and Mumble and IRC.

43:50.540 --> 43:53.820
We use all the tools, Rocket Chat, whatever.

43:53.820 --> 43:57.940
But when you meet face-to-face, different things happen.

43:57.940 --> 43:59.860
You can have a conversation in a corridor

43:59.860 --> 44:00.700
and someone will say,

44:00.700 --> 44:01.780
wouldn't it be great if this happened?

44:01.780 --> 44:03.540
And then someone will go back to their hotel room

44:03.540 --> 44:06.540
or the bar usually and sit back on their lap

44:06.540 --> 44:09.240
and then give a demo, a lightning talk later that day

44:09.240 --> 44:12.020
saying, we discussed this thing and look, it's now a thing.

44:12.020 --> 44:13.220
Wow, cool.

44:13.220 --> 44:14.600
That kind of stuff is quite good fun,

44:14.600 --> 44:17.900
especially when you've got a couple of hundred people

44:17.900 --> 44:20.760
who are all working in the same direction.

44:21.980 --> 44:23.440
You could reach out to the right people

44:23.440 --> 44:25.980
who have the knowledge about whatever it is

44:25.980 --> 44:26.820
you want to achieve.

44:26.820 --> 44:29.500
Yeah, that's not just productive.

44:29.500 --> 44:33.340
What's fun about that is when I've been in those situations,

44:33.340 --> 44:35.740
that's been some of the most personally satisfying work

44:35.740 --> 44:39.540
I've done is it's just a lot of fun professionally

44:39.540 --> 44:41.140
to be working in a team environment

44:41.140 --> 44:43.500
that's firing on all cylinders or close to it.

44:43.500 --> 44:46.220
And so I kind of want to poke Wimpy's brain for a second

44:46.220 --> 44:49.940
because I imagine except for the snap sprint

44:49.940 --> 44:52.160
that happened a little bit ago,

44:52.160 --> 44:56.260
but this is Wimpy's first canonical event

44:56.260 --> 44:58.540
as a canonical employee.

44:58.540 --> 45:00.780
And I would imagine starting at a place,

45:00.780 --> 45:02.400
you've heard these names,

45:02.400 --> 45:04.300
you've talked to these people online,

45:04.300 --> 45:05.340
you've met some of them,

45:05.340 --> 45:08.060
but now all of a sudden you've jumped in the deep end

45:08.060 --> 45:12.020
and you're working with them, you're shaking hands.

45:12.020 --> 45:15.460
This must have gone from real to very real,

45:15.460 --> 45:16.380
I would imagine for you.

45:16.380 --> 45:18.140
Is that true, Wimpy?

45:18.140 --> 45:18.980
It is.

45:18.980 --> 45:22.180
I mean, I got to meet all of my team in person

45:22.180 --> 45:25.540
who I've got to know most of them

45:25.540 --> 45:28.780
over the years of contributing that never met before,

45:28.780 --> 45:31.820
including my manager, so that was obviously good.

45:31.820 --> 45:34.500
But then yes, there's lots of people in canonical

45:34.500 --> 45:37.180
who've helped me along the way,

45:37.180 --> 45:40.380
some of whom I got to meet in Heidelberg earlier this year

45:40.380 --> 45:43.340
and some who I got to meet for the first time

45:43.340 --> 45:44.820
this time round.

45:44.820 --> 45:49.820
But these sprints are pretty intense efforts.

45:50.940 --> 45:54.080
They're absolutely exhausting for all the right reasons.

45:55.180 --> 45:59.220
It's pretty sort of a breakneck speed during the day

45:59.220 --> 46:03.100
and then the exhaustion falls into beer and food

46:03.100 --> 46:07.140
in the evening and lots of fun with everyone.

46:07.140 --> 46:08.540
So yeah, they're really good fun.

46:08.540 --> 46:13.540
And I was, I think, a stereotypical first time

46:13.540 --> 46:16.780
sprint attendee in that I came back with the Ubu flu,

46:16.780 --> 46:19.020
which I hear is something of a tradition.

46:19.020 --> 46:20.060
Of course.

46:20.060 --> 46:22.580
One thing that was different about you being,

46:22.580 --> 46:26.580
this being your first one, which most people don't get,

46:26.580 --> 46:28.940
was you were thrown in as a track lead,

46:28.940 --> 46:33.580
so you had to manage a track of sessions

46:33.580 --> 46:35.740
and not many people have to do that.

46:35.740 --> 46:36.580
Sounds about right.

46:36.580 --> 46:38.140
That is the deep end.

46:38.140 --> 46:40.420
Yeah, the deep end was quite deep.

46:40.420 --> 46:43.780
That's where he thrives, I think.

46:43.780 --> 46:45.420
I just stepped on West's switch.

46:45.420 --> 46:46.260
Wow, Wimpy.

46:46.260 --> 46:47.660
Well, that sounds like it must,

46:47.660 --> 46:49.900
so now you're back at home, other than the sickness,

46:49.900 --> 46:52.700
you must really feel like you have a job job now.

46:52.700 --> 46:54.380
I do have a job job now, yeah.

46:54.380 --> 46:58.100
And we know what's in store for the next six months now,

46:58.100 --> 47:01.420
not just within our team, but in all of the teams

47:01.420 --> 47:04.580
and how all of the teams are gonna be pulling together.

47:04.580 --> 47:07.360
To give you a flavor of what went on,

47:07.360 --> 47:10.180
we were all given T-shirts at the end of this event

47:10.180 --> 47:11.820
and on the front of these T-shirts,

47:11.820 --> 47:16.820
it simply says, snap, snaps, snappy, snapped, snapcraft.

47:17.580 --> 47:21.740
So if you're in any doubt what the theme was,

47:21.740 --> 47:24.500
I think that underscores it rather clearly.

47:24.500 --> 47:29.020
I think it's such a fascinating time right now

47:29.020 --> 47:31.940
and Canonical has moved very fast on the snap packages.

47:31.940 --> 47:34.780
Today, Flatpak got a big update,

47:34.780 --> 47:38.220
so this is an area that's getting a lot of attention

47:38.220 --> 47:39.820
and a lot of focus right now,

47:39.820 --> 47:43.420
but Wimpy, I guess going from the outside in,

47:43.420 --> 47:45.620
I think you are sitting in a position

47:45.620 --> 47:48.420
where you maybe had suspected

47:48.420 --> 47:49.700
that there was people in there

47:49.700 --> 47:51.820
that were passionate about this stuff

47:51.820 --> 47:53.980
or you probably hoped there was people in there

47:53.980 --> 47:55.280
that followed current events,

47:55.280 --> 47:59.340
but as an external viewer,

47:59.340 --> 48:01.900
when you look at the Canonical group,

48:01.900 --> 48:03.240
you know a few names,

48:03.240 --> 48:06.620
but maybe you could name four, five, six people

48:06.620 --> 48:08.920
at Canonical, the people at the top,

48:08.920 --> 48:11.940
the people that join us frequently in the communities,

48:11.940 --> 48:14.860
but I wonder, Wimpy, going in now,

48:14.860 --> 48:16.860
did you walk away with a sense

48:16.860 --> 48:20.140
that people there are hardcore Linux advocates,

48:20.140 --> 48:20.980
they're Linux users?

48:20.980 --> 48:22.820
What was some of the senses you walked away with

48:22.820 --> 48:25.640
and some of the things you suspected but were confirmed,

48:25.640 --> 48:27.040
what you can share at least?

48:28.380 --> 48:31.980
Without a doubt, these were the 250, 300,

48:31.980 --> 48:36.980
and 300 most smart people I've been in a place with ever.

48:36.980 --> 48:39.340
Everybody is an expert in something.

48:39.340 --> 48:40.180
Wow, that must be exciting.

48:40.180 --> 48:43.380
You'll not hear the names of many of the people

48:43.380 --> 48:44.220
that were there,

48:44.220 --> 48:46.820
but they're all doing impressive things

48:46.820 --> 48:49.060
and creating great technology.

48:49.060 --> 48:49.900
Geez.

48:49.900 --> 48:52.700
And that was my impression was

48:52.700 --> 48:55.020
there are some seriously clever people around me

48:55.020 --> 48:55.860
at the moment.

48:55.860 --> 48:56.700
Isn't that a great feeling?

48:56.700 --> 48:57.540
That must feel very rewarding

48:57.540 --> 48:58.860
to work with a group like that.

48:58.860 --> 48:59.700
Yeah, it is.

48:59.700 --> 49:00.520
That's cool.

49:00.520 --> 49:02.580
It's terrific.

49:02.580 --> 49:05.060
So yeah, that was my sort of general feeling

49:05.060 --> 49:08.500
was what an excellent group of people

49:08.500 --> 49:10.260
Canonical have got working for them.

49:10.260 --> 49:15.260
And I only got to see this one group

49:15.540 --> 49:18.100
cross-section of the people in Canonical.

49:18.100 --> 49:19.460
And I imagine it's the same

49:19.460 --> 49:22.700
as you go across the other divisions as well.

49:22.700 --> 49:23.540
I think, you know,

49:23.540 --> 49:27.700
I universally I have had an incredible experience

49:27.700 --> 49:30.260
when I go meet these companies

49:31.580 --> 49:33.420
and I talk to the people

49:33.420 --> 49:35.140
who don't come out publicly

49:35.140 --> 49:36.180
and I walk away going,

49:36.180 --> 49:38.220
holy crap, they're doing some amazing stuff

49:38.220 --> 49:39.940
that they're not even discussing.

49:39.940 --> 49:42.140
They have people that are advancing technology

49:42.140 --> 49:44.500
that they're not bragging about.

49:44.500 --> 49:45.340
Exactly.

49:45.340 --> 49:47.140
A lot of these companies,

49:47.140 --> 49:48.820
you know, Canonical included,

49:48.820 --> 49:50.380
when I meet the people I'm like,

49:50.380 --> 49:52.660
geez, how come you guys aren't telling the story?

49:52.660 --> 49:54.820
This is really something.

49:54.820 --> 49:56.100
I think it's impressive

49:56.100 --> 49:58.660
and it's extremely reassuring

49:58.660 --> 50:00.340
when you get down below the surface,

50:00.340 --> 50:01.980
you get below the spokespersons,

50:01.980 --> 50:04.100
you get below the blogs,

50:04.100 --> 50:05.780
you get below the Twitter feeds

50:05.780 --> 50:06.860
and you look at the people

50:06.860 --> 50:08.340
that are actually contributing.

50:08.340 --> 50:09.180
That is some of the,

50:09.180 --> 50:11.660
at least if you're a tech head,

50:11.660 --> 50:13.220
that's some of the most inspirational stuff

50:13.220 --> 50:14.660
about this industry.

50:14.660 --> 50:15.900
So that's really cool.

50:15.900 --> 50:18.660
And guys, I don't know if there,

50:18.660 --> 50:20.700
is there anything that we should be looking forward to

50:20.700 --> 50:22.660
that's coming soon with Snap packages

50:22.660 --> 50:23.500
or anything like that

50:23.500 --> 50:24.340
that you can tease us with?

50:24.340 --> 50:25.180
Yeah.

50:25.180 --> 50:27.140
So there were some lightning talks

50:27.140 --> 50:28.460
at the end of the days

50:28.460 --> 50:31.140
and one of the ones that I was quite pleased to see

50:31.140 --> 50:34.940
was Delta updates for Snap packages.

50:34.940 --> 50:35.780
No way.

50:37.180 --> 50:40.180
So like if you have like a LibreOffice Snap,

50:40.180 --> 50:42.500
it's quite chunky,

50:42.500 --> 50:45.180
but they're adding the ability

50:45.180 --> 50:47.380
for the backend to do Delta

50:47.380 --> 50:49.420
so that when next time you get a Snap update,

50:49.420 --> 50:51.020
it only does a binary Delta,

50:51.020 --> 50:52.660
it uses XDIF or something.

50:52.660 --> 50:54.860
And the guy who was talking about this

50:54.860 --> 50:55.780
gave a presentation,

50:55.780 --> 50:58.060
not just about the technology underneath.

50:58.060 --> 51:00.140
I mean, he gave a quick lightning talk about

51:00.140 --> 51:02.660
his name's Tommy Richards.

51:02.660 --> 51:04.860
And he gave a talk about,

51:04.860 --> 51:07.420
a lightning talk showing downloading,

51:07.420 --> 51:08.940
I think it was Inkscape or something.

51:08.940 --> 51:11.340
And then he enabled Deltas

51:11.340 --> 51:13.060
and then showed downloading the same thing again.

51:13.060 --> 51:14.140
And it was super fast.

51:14.140 --> 51:16.180
I mean, it was like noticeable difference

51:16.180 --> 51:17.980
between many, many seconds

51:17.980 --> 51:19.260
and a couple of seconds.

51:20.180 --> 51:23.500
And then he gave a talk about how that's implemented

51:23.500 --> 51:25.420
and the analysis that they did

51:25.420 --> 51:26.660
in order to determine

51:26.660 --> 51:28.340
what types of packages compress well.

51:28.340 --> 51:29.700
And it turns out there are some

51:29.700 --> 51:31.260
that don't compress particularly well.

51:31.260 --> 51:32.540
And there are good reasons for that.

51:32.540 --> 51:34.140
And it was a great learning exercise

51:34.140 --> 51:35.420
for them to figure out,

51:35.420 --> 51:37.780
what are the best algorithms to use

51:37.780 --> 51:40.020
and what's the best methodology

51:40.020 --> 51:41.700
to develop this kind of software.

51:41.700 --> 51:43.500
And it was quite fascinating to watch.

51:43.500 --> 51:44.340
Holy smokes, you know,

51:44.340 --> 51:47.140
as somebody who's home connections on a MiFi

51:47.140 --> 51:49.900
and somebody who occasionally broadcast from the road,

51:49.900 --> 51:52.300
I thank you so much for Delta updates.

51:52.300 --> 51:53.700
They are my favorite thing

51:53.700 --> 51:55.980
when I have a distro that supports Delta updates.

51:55.980 --> 51:57.980
It's a, that is,

51:57.980 --> 51:59.500
my bandwidth thanks you too.

51:59.500 --> 52:03.980
I am legitimately excited about both Flatpaks and Snaps.

52:03.980 --> 52:05.500
I am probably personally

52:05.500 --> 52:07.540
a little more interested in Snaps

52:07.540 --> 52:09.300
because I'm already using a bunch of them

52:09.300 --> 52:12.140
and I don't have any Flatpaks that are actually like,

52:12.140 --> 52:16.020
the practicalness, the easy to use level faster.

52:16.020 --> 52:17.860
And so therefore, yeah, that's what I want to use.

52:17.860 --> 52:19.140
Yeah, and the apps, the couple of apps

52:19.140 --> 52:20.420
that I wanted to try real quick

52:20.420 --> 52:22.260
or the ones I don't want to futz with are already available.

52:22.260 --> 52:23.700
And I would love to see more, absolutely.

52:23.700 --> 52:24.620
And I could totally see,

52:24.620 --> 52:26.060
I could see a huge place for this

52:26.060 --> 52:30.260
in like enterprise or proprietary type deployments of things

52:30.260 --> 52:31.620
where you already have all your own dependencies

52:31.620 --> 52:33.100
and you just want a little bundle that you ship to

52:33.100 --> 52:34.140
and you're going to probably run

52:34.140 --> 52:36.700
some sort of Ubuntu cloud type operating system already.

52:36.700 --> 52:38.260
No kidding, Wes.

52:38.260 --> 52:39.980
I would have used the hell out of that back in the day.

52:39.980 --> 52:41.580
Yeah, you're just like, oh, everything works.

52:41.580 --> 52:43.420
It's in its wonderful little Snap, bam,

52:43.420 --> 52:45.060
on in the server, you're good to go.

52:45.060 --> 52:47.100
Geez, that makes me want to be a sysadmin again right there.

52:47.100 --> 52:51.220
That would be so convenient and straightforward.

52:52.220 --> 52:53.380
Damn, yeah, absolutely.

52:53.380 --> 52:56.060
And you know, Wes, I still have a chance.

52:56.060 --> 52:56.900
You still do.

52:56.900 --> 52:57.740
There's still a chance.

52:57.740 --> 53:00.300
Perhaps I could use my fleet of DigitalOcean droplets.

53:00.300 --> 53:02.020
One of our sponsors here on the Unplugged program,

53:02.020 --> 53:06.020
go to digitalotion.com and use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

53:06.020 --> 53:07.460
That's one word and it's lowercase

53:07.460 --> 53:08.900
and you plug it in there on your dashboard

53:08.900 --> 53:09.980
and you get a $10 credit.

53:09.980 --> 53:12.380
And this is why you want a $10 credit.

53:12.380 --> 53:14.500
DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider

53:14.500 --> 53:16.220
that is dedicated to offering the most intuitive

53:16.220 --> 53:19.340
and easy way for you to spin up a badass Linux box

53:19.340 --> 53:21.100
on their crazy great infrastructure.

53:21.100 --> 53:22.300
They got great connections.

53:22.300 --> 53:23.860
They got all SSDs.

53:23.860 --> 53:25.700
They have a super sweet interface

53:25.700 --> 53:27.020
that's better than it could even,

53:27.020 --> 53:28.860
like if this was a desktop app

53:28.860 --> 53:31.660
that you like had to like install as a package

53:31.660 --> 53:32.500
on your desktop,

53:32.500 --> 53:34.100
I'd be like, man, this is just such a great app.

53:34.100 --> 53:34.940
It's a web app.

53:34.940 --> 53:35.860
It's all HTML5.

53:35.860 --> 53:36.700
It's a web app.

53:36.700 --> 53:37.540
It works on your phone.

53:37.540 --> 53:38.980
It works on your crappy browser.

53:38.980 --> 53:41.940
It's a web app that actually is useful

53:41.940 --> 53:44.740
and it's easy to use, but it's also extremely powerful.

53:44.740 --> 53:46.100
If you're a total noob

53:46.100 --> 53:48.620
or you've been setting up Linux servers for like 15 years,

53:48.620 --> 53:50.020
you're gonna find this to be a nice UI.

53:50.020 --> 53:51.380
Do you agree as somebody, you agree?

53:51.380 --> 53:52.660
Yeah, absolutely.

53:52.660 --> 53:53.820
And I gotta tell you,

53:53.820 --> 53:55.180
when you use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED

53:55.180 --> 53:56.500
and you get a $10 credit,

53:56.500 --> 53:58.100
you could actually get a lot of distance out of that

53:58.100 --> 54:00.700
because you can use hourly pricing over DigitalOcean.

54:00.700 --> 54:02.420
So if there's something you wanna play with,

54:02.420 --> 54:04.860
like OpenVPN or TinkVPN,

54:04.860 --> 54:07.340
or maybe you wanna play with MB for 15 minutes

54:07.340 --> 54:08.220
or Nextcloud. I still am using it

54:08.220 --> 54:09.420
to compile my kernels.

54:09.420 --> 54:11.340
When you have a custom arch kernel,

54:11.340 --> 54:12.500
you just spin up a droplet.

54:12.500 --> 54:13.340
Super fast.

54:13.340 --> 54:14.460
You run the code to compile the kernel,

54:14.460 --> 54:16.100
which is a make or whatever.

54:16.100 --> 54:18.220
Which level droplet do you go with?

54:18.220 --> 54:20.820
I usually go to the, what's the two-core one?

54:20.820 --> 54:21.660
That's what I usually go with.

54:21.660 --> 54:22.500
This is what I was gonna say,

54:22.500 --> 54:23.420
because for three cents an hour,

54:23.420 --> 54:24.260
I was gonna say,

54:24.260 --> 54:25.100
because I know,

54:25.100 --> 54:26.580
because a lot of everybody goes with the $5 droplet.

54:26.580 --> 54:27.420
Which is a great deal.

54:27.420 --> 54:28.260
It's a wonderful,

54:28.260 --> 54:29.100
a little web presence,

54:29.100 --> 54:31.380
your own domain, a blog, perfect.

54:31.380 --> 54:34.420
But if you're just gonna build,

54:34.420 --> 54:35.620
so if you go with the two-core,

54:35.620 --> 54:36.700
so if you go with the Westrig,

54:36.700 --> 54:37.580
it's three cents an hour,

54:37.580 --> 54:38.420
it's two gigs of RAM,

54:38.420 --> 54:39.260
a two-core processor,

54:39.260 --> 54:40.340
40 gigabyte SSD,

54:40.340 --> 54:41.380
they're all SSDs,

54:41.380 --> 54:42.980
and three terabytes of transfer.

54:42.980 --> 54:44.380
I don't have a reason to go

54:44.380 --> 54:45.980
with the high-memory droplets yet,

54:45.980 --> 54:48.620
but man, these things, they're crazy.

54:48.620 --> 54:51.940
Like 64 gigs of RAM, 224 gigabytes of RAM,

54:51.940 --> 54:53.940
and they're a ton of money, monthly.

54:53.940 --> 54:55.340
But of course, if you need that much RAM,

54:55.340 --> 54:56.180
that's probably not a big deal.

54:56.180 --> 54:58.500
But something where you're already doing some caching,

54:58.500 --> 55:00.460
or maybe you just need a big Redis that runs,

55:00.460 --> 55:01.300
or Memcache.

55:01.300 --> 55:03.860
And look, dude, if you switch it over to hourly,

55:03.860 --> 55:05.060
okay, you know what?

55:05.060 --> 55:05.900
I could afford 18 cents an hour.

55:05.900 --> 55:08.180
Those are all numbers that I'm okay with.

55:08.180 --> 55:10.900
Those are, even the $2 an hour,

55:10.900 --> 55:12.780
like if I'm doing it for two hours.

55:12.780 --> 55:14.660
At most a day, at most a day, maybe.

55:14.660 --> 55:16.060
And you're like, okay, well then that's fine.

55:16.060 --> 55:17.620
Yeah, it's a pretty cool system.

55:17.620 --> 55:18.900
And then on top of all of it,

55:18.900 --> 55:20.380
they have really great tutorials.

55:20.380 --> 55:22.140
So you can just deploy a stack of apps,

55:22.140 --> 55:24.620
or you can use one of the, like here's one,

55:24.620 --> 55:27.300
pretty relevant, how to protect your server

55:27.300 --> 55:28.980
against the Cal Linux vulnerability.

55:28.980 --> 55:30.100
Well, it might be good to know.

55:30.100 --> 55:31.620
Oh, that's topical, look at that.

55:31.620 --> 55:34.600
Look at DigitalOcean over there.

55:34.600 --> 55:36.220
So here's what I want you to do.

55:36.220 --> 55:38.380
Go to DigitalOcean, set up an account,

55:38.380 --> 55:40.060
and use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

55:40.060 --> 55:41.740
We'll give you a $10 credit,

55:41.740 --> 55:43.820
and then you can try any of this stuff for free.

55:43.820 --> 55:46.580
You can run the $5 rig for two months,

55:46.580 --> 55:48.500
or you can go run the Crazy Memory rig,

55:48.500 --> 55:49.940
or you can run the West rig,

55:49.940 --> 55:51.300
and build your kernels and stuff like that.

55:51.300 --> 55:54.340
And I think the West rig's like three cents an hour.

55:54.340 --> 55:56.100
Yeah, it's really, it's not that much.

55:56.100 --> 55:59.500
I should do that for the, you know what, after the show?

55:59.500 --> 56:02.020
If I remember, let's talk about how I could do that for my,

56:02.020 --> 56:04.300
because you know, I got that MacBook running Arch

56:04.300 --> 56:06.180
that you set up during the show.

56:06.180 --> 56:11.180
And the kernel builds, they're like an hour, they're long.

56:12.380 --> 56:14.220
So you know what the nice thing about Arch is?

56:14.220 --> 56:17.380
It's pretty easy to run your own like Arch repo,

56:17.380 --> 56:18.460
or it's something you can add.

56:18.460 --> 56:21.140
And so then you just, you build everything on a big droplet,

56:21.140 --> 56:23.260
you transfer it over to your $5 a month droplet,

56:23.260 --> 56:26.040
because all you need is it to be like an HTTP endpoint.

56:26.040 --> 56:28.760
And now you've got your own custom little Chris repo.

56:29.940 --> 56:32.460
Man Wes, I'm gonna buy you a beer.

56:32.460 --> 56:35.460
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED,

56:35.460 --> 56:38.980
and go build your kernels in the cloud like a boost.

56:38.980 --> 56:41.200
DigitalOcean.com, big thanks DigitalOcean

56:41.200 --> 56:44.420
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

56:44.420 --> 56:46.700
All right guys, I wanted to talk about something

56:46.700 --> 56:48.740
that I'm beginning to change my tune on.

56:48.740 --> 56:52.060
Do you remember that when I did a road trip to Noah's house

56:52.060 --> 56:54.380
to like witness his home automation system?

56:54.380 --> 56:56.020
And I was actually really impressed.

56:56.020 --> 56:56.860
I was impressed as well.

56:56.860 --> 56:59.020
And it's even cooler than we could capture on camera.

56:59.020 --> 57:00.020
That guy's got chaps.

57:00.020 --> 57:02.140
And on top of that, he's added on to it.

57:02.140 --> 57:05.940
And so I have kind of changed my tune a little bit

57:05.940 --> 57:08.100
on home automation, and there's this great-

57:08.100 --> 57:09.500
You're tired of Rekai leaving the oven on?

57:09.500 --> 57:10.340
Is that what you're saying?

57:10.340 --> 57:11.180
You're farting.

57:11.180 --> 57:12.920
Ha ha ha ha ha.

57:12.920 --> 57:15.140
Ah ha ha ha ha ha.

57:15.140 --> 57:15.980
Oh.

57:15.980 --> 57:16.820
Sorry Rekai.

57:16.820 --> 57:17.640
Oh, I catch it.

57:17.640 --> 57:18.740
You've listened to user error.

57:18.740 --> 57:19.980
I was listening to it on the way up.

57:19.980 --> 57:20.980
Yeah, isn't that funny?

57:20.980 --> 57:22.380
Yeah, isn't that funny?

57:22.380 --> 57:23.540
Man, and you know what?

57:23.540 --> 57:24.360
I've done that too.

57:24.360 --> 57:27.080
The pizza situation since that episode has been rough.

57:27.080 --> 57:29.620
All right, so this is really cool though,

57:29.620 --> 57:31.940
because it's building a home automation system

57:31.940 --> 57:33.500
where you run it all on your own land,

57:33.500 --> 57:35.240
powered by Raspberry Pis.

57:35.240 --> 57:38.500
And I've been experimenting with something recently.

57:38.500 --> 57:39.740
This is gonna sound so stupid,

57:39.740 --> 57:40.940
but just go with me for a second.

57:40.940 --> 57:44.620
I've been experimenting with, during the weekdays,

57:44.620 --> 57:46.260
leaving my monitors on.

57:46.260 --> 57:48.300
Okay, tell me more, tell me more.

57:48.300 --> 57:51.060
Well, traditionally, I've got these two.

57:51.060 --> 57:52.460
Yeah, what's the monitor situation?

57:52.460 --> 57:54.140
Oh man, I've got these great monitors.

57:54.140 --> 57:56.740
They're 27-inch ASUS monitors.

57:56.740 --> 57:58.260
I got two identical monitors.

57:58.260 --> 58:00.300
One is vertical. Full HD, something else?

58:00.300 --> 58:04.540
2K, so they're like, what is it, like 2560 by 1440

58:04.540 --> 58:08.220
or whatever, but one is vertical and one's horizontal.

58:08.220 --> 58:11.860
I love it, I love it for doing research, show prep,

58:11.860 --> 58:14.340
or even just having like a terminal that's doing updates

58:14.340 --> 58:15.180
and a telegram session.

58:15.180 --> 58:16.620
The vertical monitor is wonderful.

58:16.620 --> 58:18.580
It's killer, it's totally, totally killer.

58:18.580 --> 58:22.300
However, one's hooked up over HDMI, or no,

58:22.300 --> 58:23.740
one's hooked up over DVI

58:23.740 --> 58:25.060
and one's hooked up over DisplayPort.

58:25.060 --> 58:27.740
Let me guess, DisplayPort, oh man.

58:27.740 --> 58:31.020
And it is, I've actually got a good system,

58:31.020 --> 58:33.120
but so when I wake the system up,

58:33.120 --> 58:37.340
the vertical monitor never fires up.

58:37.340 --> 58:38.500
That's the DisplayPort monitor.

58:38.500 --> 58:39.740
Yeah, you've been here.

58:39.740 --> 58:41.020
Oh yeah, I've been dealing,

58:41.020 --> 58:42.380
I just got some new monitors at work.

58:42.380 --> 58:44.220
So we have six monitors now in a row

58:44.220 --> 58:46.900
in the room I'm sitting in with verticals on the left

58:46.900 --> 58:47.940
and right-hand most side.

58:47.940 --> 58:49.140
So it's a really nice setup,

58:49.140 --> 58:52.300
but one side is all DisplayPort and the other side,

58:52.300 --> 58:53.980
I have one HDMI and then one DisplayPort

58:53.980 --> 58:56.180
and then a DisplayPort chained to the third monitor,

58:56.180 --> 58:58.620
which the chaining is actually working wonderfully,

58:58.620 --> 59:02.420
but the power save, man, it's crazy.

59:02.420 --> 59:04.420
I have a trick, I have a trick.

59:04.420 --> 59:07.300
So what I do is my main monitor,

59:07.300 --> 59:11.380
which I set via Gnome's display manager,

59:11.380 --> 59:12.660
because otherwise the DisplayPort

59:12.660 --> 59:14.740
would by default be the main display.

59:14.740 --> 59:16.520
And in fact, when GDM starts up,

59:16.520 --> 59:20.460
the login screen is sideways on the vertical monitor

59:20.460 --> 59:23.940
and the horizontal monitor that sits in front of me is off.

59:23.940 --> 59:24.780
Perfect.

59:24.780 --> 59:26.500
And then I log in and Gnome 3 starts

59:26.500 --> 59:29.700
and it rearranges the displays like a champ every time.

59:29.700 --> 59:33.340
See, I'm on Unity too, so it's not even, it's worse.

59:33.340 --> 59:34.660
Oh, okay.

59:34.660 --> 59:38.700
But that's only if I've booted the system.

59:38.700 --> 59:40.660
If I'm waking the system from sleep

59:40.660 --> 59:42.120
or if I've just turned the monitors off

59:42.120 --> 59:43.420
but left the system running

59:43.420 --> 59:46.220
and maybe like let the drive spin down,

59:46.220 --> 59:48.860
when I move the mouse and hit the power button

59:48.860 --> 59:52.340
on both monitors, only the DVI monitor wakes up.

59:52.340 --> 59:54.100
The DisplayPort monitor never wakes up,

59:54.100 --> 59:56.100
which is where my telegram is

59:56.100 --> 59:59.020
and where my terminal session is and all that.

59:59.020 --> 01:00:00.020
I need that monitor.

01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:05.020
So what I have done is I've installed a Gnome extension.

01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:06.340
Of course.

01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:08.500
That you just, you click it

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:10.220
and it puts your displays to sleep.

01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:12.820
So what I do is I click it,

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:17.440
I have the horizontal monitor on, it is powered up,

01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:21.900
and the vertical monitor, the DisplayPort monitor is off.

01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:24.340
I hit the sleep.

01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:25.180
Yep.

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:27.820
I turn the DisplayPort monitor on,

01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:29.660
I hit the control button on the keyboard,

01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:34.100
it then sends a new wake-up command to all the displays

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:36.500
and the DisplayPort monitor comes back,

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:37.340
pops right back.

01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:38.740
Okay.

01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:42.740
But this is about a 55-second process.

01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:43.580
Yeah.

01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:44.620
I've kind of timed it.

01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:45.860
And it's super frustrating.

01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:47.700
And one of the things I've done recently

01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:49.020
is during the weekdays,

01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:52.900
I've decided to just leave my monitors on.

01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:55.460
And by God, I actually feel more,

01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:58.140
I just sit down and I immediately start working.

01:00:58.140 --> 01:00:59.780
All you do is the lock screen and you're good.

01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:01.220
Or what, maybe not even that.

01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:02.060
Boom.

01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:02.900
No, just, I mean.

01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:04.320
I mean, it's the studio, so.

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:06.820
If anybody hacks me, there's only one person

01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:08.380
it's gonna be, and it's gonna be the beard.

01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:10.500
And I don't think that lock screen's gonna be

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:11.340
what prevents him, so.

01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:12.180
No, no.

01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:13.020
Don't do it.

01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:14.020
He's had rude since he got here, Chris.

01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:16.540
Yeah, not only that, but he knows what the password is

01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:18.780
for my account because all my studio machines

01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:20.420
have a shared password.

01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:22.100
And so I don't bother with the lock screen,

01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:23.580
I immediately sit down and start working.

01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:26.540
And I have just, I have been, Wes,

01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:28.620
I gotta tell ya, it's made a difference.

01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:30.940
I feel great, but now,

01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:33.420
now I got this really annoying problem.

01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:36.220
Like, I gotta like, turn on my lights,

01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:37.420
and then there's two different places

01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:39.100
I gotta go to flip a switch,

01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:40.700
and sometimes I gotta turn on the fan,

01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:42.060
depending on the temperature.

01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:45.500
All this other hassle I gotta do before I get to work.

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:46.780
It's really highlighted the little,

01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:48.340
how much the little things make a difference

01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:49.180
in your everyday work.

01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:50.100
This is actually what I'm saying.

01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:51.420
And so I kind of have been,

01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:52.940
I've kind of been turning around to the idea

01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:54.220
of automating a couple of things.

01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:56.500
Like, if I could automate the monitor wake-up process

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:57.780
so they could be turned off.

01:01:57.780 --> 01:01:59.300
If I could automate the lights turning on

01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:00.660
at the right time and the fan turned on

01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:03.100
so that when I sit down, I am ready to go.

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:05.580
If I could have like an NFC checkpoint

01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:07.180
or something at the entrance of the studio.

01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:08.580
Or when your phone joins the wifi.

01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:09.420
Exactly. Or whatever.

01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:11.500
And if this, then that triggers all of that stuff

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:12.340
and turns it on.

01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:13.600
I've been thinking more and more like,

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:16.660
not only would that just be nice to have, but great.

01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:17.960
I'll film the entire setup,

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:19.200
and it would make great content too.

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.220
So it kind of seems like a double win, right?

01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:22.060
Yeah.

01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:23.580
I've been thinking about this setup

01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:24.660
on how they've done it.

01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:27.940
And man, this is sitting pretty with me.

01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:31.060
They said it was a huge project for their office,

01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:33.860
and they wanted light control, conference call room,

01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:37.140
occupancy signalization, individual access codes,

01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:39.500
audio systems with wireless music streaming,

01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:41.580
manageable audio experiences in different rooms,

01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:43.060
like the bathroom.

01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:43.900
Honestly, with all this,

01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:46.020
I'm impressed that they were able to take the time

01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:48.020
to focus on this totally out of,

01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:49.740
like this is a major accomplishment

01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:52.780
for not exactly a business request, you know?

01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:53.620
I agree.

01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:55.460
And they worked on like light controls

01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:56.300
and all that kind of stuff,

01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:57.140
and they wanted to be able to control it

01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:58.500
via web application.

01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:00.220
What matters is they built it all

01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:03.100
with this super badass Raspberry Pi system.

01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:04.740
They have one master Raspberry Pi,

01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:06.820
which controls all the low level hardware.

01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:10.140
And then they have this thing called the distribution board,

01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:11.180
and I'm showing a picture of it.

01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:12.580
Oh, that's beautiful.

01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:13.920
It's so beautiful that before the show,

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.100
I just sent a picture of this to Noah.

01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:16.260
I'm like, Noah, look at this.

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:17.300
Noah, just look at this.

01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:18.420
This is so gorgeous.

01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:19.820
This is so great.

01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:21.160
And then they have a second device

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:22.880
called the relay driver board,

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:24.300
which does what you would expect.

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:26.140
It also runs a web server on the main Pi

01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:28.180
with a web application that allows the controls.

01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:31.380
They have occupancy signalization via movement sensors,

01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:33.220
which is how Noah does it in his house.

01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:34.660
They have TV panel management

01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:36.500
with Pis connected to different TVs,

01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:41.500
and they have the Pis all centrally located in this rack.

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:44.380
So if a TV, they have an HDMI feed that goes out to the TV,

01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:45.700
but all of the Pis are in one place.

01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:48.060
You don't have to go out to the TV to service it.

01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:48.900
Genius.

01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:49.740
That's smart.

01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:52.900
It's like bringing a patch panel to Raspberry Pis.

01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:54.940
It's a patch panel of Raspberry Pis,

01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:56.600
and this is the part of home automation

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:58.780
that's really, I'm loving,

01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:03.780
because I could do HDMI over Ethernet for long runs,

01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:07.020
and I'm loving this.

01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:08.780
I don't know how you'd ever afford all of it,

01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:09.860
but I think it's a great system.

01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:11.380
And they talk about how they set up their audio

01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:12.420
and all of that.

01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:14.060
After looking at this,

01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:15.820
it's really kind of turning my head

01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:17.380
towards home automation again,

01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:18.500
but in a way that doesn't feel like

01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:21.020
it's tied to a product or a brand.

01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:22.240
I think that's part of the part.

01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:24.380
Noah uses a lot of interesting things,

01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:26.000
and I think that he's a very cool,

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.620
it's almost like an analog approach,

01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:29.340
but it does necessarily involve

01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:32.260
a certain amount of products or boxes,

01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:33.620
and it feels hard to replicate,

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:35.100
or very much like,

01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:36.780
well, I've invested in this company's way,

01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:38.380
or at least I've invested in these things,

01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:40.460
and I need this equipment to do it.

01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:42.220
Raspberry Pis are $35,

01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:45.940
and Ethernet is whatever by the spool.

01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:48.500
Plus I have Ethernet run to all the rooms

01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:49.340
in the studio already.

01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:50.580
You probably have the infrastructure to do it.

01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:51.580
You have the,

01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:52.420
I mean, you don't have the time,

01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:53.620
but you have the Linux knowledge

01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:55.260
and the wherewithal to do it.

01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:56.740
Yeah, we need somebody to come out in the studio

01:04:56.740 --> 01:04:57.580
and work with us, Wes,

01:04:57.580 --> 01:04:58.420
to do all this kind of stuff.

01:04:58.420 --> 01:04:59.900
We need some serious projects we can do,

01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:01.220
because I've got like three or four Pis

01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:02.060
in the studio right now.

01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:03.540
They're just sitting around, right?

01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:05.980
Or like Onion Omegas or who knows what.

01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:07.580
Yeah, yeah, or Arduinos.

01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:08.500
We'll be eating that in a moment.

01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:10.620
Anybody in the Mamba Room experimenting at all

01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:12.180
with any form of home automation,

01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:14.060
even if it's like the Hughes brand

01:05:14.060 --> 01:05:15.820
like I mess around with or anything like that,

01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:17.460
anybody in the virtual log?

01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:18.300
Yeah, go ahead.

01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:21.380
I've been actually looking into using two Raspberry Pis

01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:23.700
to solve an issue in my house,

01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:28.700
which is the thermostat that I have is in one location

01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:34.100
and my bedroom is at the other end of the house,

01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:39.100
which means my bedroom in the winter is always cold.

01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:40.660
So I was thinking about replacing

01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:45.140
my simple, stupid thermostat with a Raspberry Pi,

01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:48.340
which I already have sitting and doing nothing,

01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:51.420
just connecting a relay to it

01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:54.380
and making it switch the thermostat on and off.

01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:58.820
And then having a second Raspberry Pi in my bedroom

01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:02.700
that talks to that other Raspberry Pi.

01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:07.220
And I can tell, you know, during the night,

01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:11.420
maybe switch that thermostat to the temperature reading

01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:14.060
from the other Raspberry Pi in my bedroom.

01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:16.420
And during the day, switch it to the living room.

01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:20.420
Solves that problem with, I have to buy a relay

01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:23.900
and two thermometers.

01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:28.660
You know, I've been thinking, it's funny you say this,

01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:29.860
because I've been thinking about the same thing

01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:32.620
when I finally set up whatever storage solution

01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:35.420
and server solution I'm gonna have in Lady Jupiter

01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:37.740
for being able to do on the road production.

01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:42.580
It's all gonna be inside a dinette booth, which is...

01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:44.020
Oh, right, this is in the rig.

01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:44.860
Right, and you've seen it.

01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:46.980
They're like plush leather seats.

01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:47.820
Pretty comfy.

01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:48.980
And they're made out of wood.

01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:52.540
It's like you're putting inside a box that's insulated.

01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:54.500
And so I've thought about putting a Raspberry Pi

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:56.500
or something in there with a temperature sensor

01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:59.260
that could automatically shut down when things get too hot

01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:02.300
because sure, in October in Washington,

01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:03.860
I'm probably not gonna have an issue.

01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:05.780
But what about in August?

01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:06.620
In Arizona.

01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:07.900
And I'm not, yeah.

01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:10.180
Or I'm going down to California in a few weeks.

01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:11.460
It could be a little warmer.

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:12.620
You park in the shade.

01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:15.620
I have no idea, or one day maybe that side of the rig

01:07:15.620 --> 01:07:16.540
is parked in the sunlight

01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:18.900
and it's just getting beat with sunlight.

01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:20.500
The temperature's gonna be all over the place.

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:22.260
And I've thought about, well, wouldn't it be great

01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:24.540
if I had something in there that not only was charting it

01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:27.620
so I had an idea of how things were going trend-wise,

01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:29.420
but also a fail-safe that said, oh, God,

01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:31.580
this is getting bad, shut down the cradle point,

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:33.940
shut down the storage array, shut down the NUC

01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:34.780
or whatever it is.

01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:36.500
Yellow alert, just power down.

01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:38.820
And then send me a message.

01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:40.660
That would be my ideal situation.

01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:43.060
So that's where I've thought about using it too.

01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:45.140
Even in the RV.

01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:45.980
You know, I've thought about it.

01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:46.820
It seems like there's a lot of applications.

01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:48.380
Once you've got that kind of like,

01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:50.620
I mean, if this, then that, that sort of style response.

01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:51.820
Like there's a lot of things you can handle

01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:54.980
like pet feeding or care, you can handle-

01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:57.860
Turning on the AC, turning on a fan.

01:07:57.860 --> 01:08:00.500
Yeah, that could be the route I go too, right?

01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:03.380
I really just want like a home API.

01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:08.380
Yeah, I looked into it and if you don't like doing things

01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:13.380
by just using components that you buy on the wheel

01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:17.540
or whatever, you can buy these relay boards

01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:21.540
for Raspberry Pis and they can handle anything

01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:26.220
from switching five volt circuits to 220 volt circuits.

01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:27.820
Oh, that sounds really handy.

01:08:27.820 --> 01:08:31.020
Anything from thermostat to lights and power.

01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:33.020
Like you could literally just shut off power

01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:38.020
to your entire computer with that Raspberry Pi relay.

01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:39.740
Just before you do that,

01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:43.340
make sure that that relay board in your mind

01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:47.060
can handle the voltage before you burn anything down.

01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:48.540
That could be bad.

01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:51.820
Yeah, but they make those and then all you have to do

01:08:51.820 --> 01:08:56.820
is they will probably be like I2C IO.

01:08:56.820 --> 01:08:59.300
So you can just plug it into your Raspberry Pi

01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:00.260
and start hacking.

01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:03.740
And so if you're a software guy and not a hardware guy,

01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:05.060
they make it pretty easy for you.

01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:06.900
It's just a few extra bucks.

01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:07.740
I like it.

01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:09.900
This is exciting and I could see,

01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:11.300
I don't know if I'll get it to the, I don't know.

01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:12.620
God, I hope I get to it this year.

01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:14.220
But with winter, I don't feel like it's the top

01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:16.420
of my priority list, but I could see early spring

01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:18.420
as being a project that I actually tackle.

01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:20.580
It's kind of just interesting to think about it now

01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:23.260
because as I start to deploy this stuff,

01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:24.460
I'll have this in the back of my mind

01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:26.140
of how I want to do this properly.

01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:27.980
So I'll set the power up and the networking for it.

01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:29.820
So it's all there when I'm ready to pull the trigger.

01:09:29.820 --> 01:09:31.140
And then just, yeah.

01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:32.620
And then when it comes time in the spring

01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:33.820
before it gets too hot,

01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:36.020
I'll have all the groundwork laid down.

01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:37.300
That could be pretty, so if you've got ideas,

01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:38.140
feel free to let me know.

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:38.980
Please do.

01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:39.820
Yeah, if you've done this,

01:09:39.820 --> 01:09:41.340
if you tackle this particular problem.

01:09:41.340 --> 01:09:43.180
And you got a VU meter that'll work with it, right?

01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:45.020
Yes, you'll have hardware dials.

01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:46.660
You can get them up on the dash.

01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:48.340
That'd be great.

01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:50.620
Who cares about this MPH?

01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:52.700
I'm looking at how my servers are doing.

01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:53.540
That's so funny.

01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:54.660
All right, well, before we go any further,

01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:56.500
if you ever wanted to get really in depth

01:09:56.500 --> 01:09:57.900
on a particular topic in Linux

01:09:57.900 --> 01:09:59.780
or on the backend infrastructure

01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:00.700
or any of the things that people

01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:01.820
are really making money on Linux,

01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:06.340
like Ruby or Python or AWS or Azure or OpenStack,

01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:07.260
any of these kinds of things

01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:08.780
that you would like to learn more about,

01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:10.940
I would encourage you to visit our sponsor, Linux Academy.

01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:14.740
Go to linuxacademy.com all unplugged.

01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:16.020
That's where you go to support the show

01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:17.740
and sign up for a seven-day free trial.

01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:19.260
That's new.

01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:20.300
I think that's a big deal

01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:22.540
because you can go in there and get a little taste,

01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:24.020
get a little idea.

01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:26.340
Linux Academy has step-by-step video courses,

01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:28.580
comprehensive study guides that you can download

01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:29.820
and use offline,

01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:31.260
and the courses come with your own server.

01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:32.660
They'll spin up on demand.

01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:34.900
I think also if maybe you've been tempted

01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:36.740
by the certification life.

01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:37.820
Right.

01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:39.620
They have really good training on that,

01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:42.060
and I mention this because I have been down this path.

01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:44.500
It's been a while, but I have been down this path,

01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:47.820
and you do want training that keeps in mind your end goal,

01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:49.580
and I think they have a really good path.

01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:51.020
They have these learning paths.

01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:52.580
They're a series of courses and content

01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:56.500
planned by instructors for specific tracks, which is nice,

01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:57.940
and they have instructor mentoring available,

01:10:57.940 --> 01:10:59.300
so if you do have questions,

01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:01.020
you can actually talk to a real human and get your answers.

01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:02.060
It's super transparent.

01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:03.420
Yeah, you can get your question answered.

01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:04.860
You get a good grasp,

01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:06.540
so you really have a good grasp.

01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:07.500
You really know what you're doing,

01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:08.340
so when you go in there,

01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:09.620
you don't have that anxiety about it.

01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:11.860
It's not that you just prepared for a test.

01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:14.100
It's you learned this because you're applying it.

01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:14.940
You understand it.

01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:16.020
You know what to do.

01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:17.580
Especially if you combine it with their labs

01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:19.540
and their hands on exercises.

01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:22.340
You go in there, and you get real-world experience

01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:23.180
on real servers.

01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:24.380
I mean, these are servers they spin up

01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:25.620
just like you would in production,

01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:27.020
and you have the whole box to yourself,

01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:28.980
the SSHN, and you're doing the job.

01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:30.380
That is great experience,

01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:31.900
and it's only the kind of thing you get

01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:34.620
when a company focuses on Linux and open source,

01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:36.380
when it's not just a thing that they do,

01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:37.500
but it's what they do.

01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:38.540
Exactly.

01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:40.460
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:41.460
Go there.

01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:43.540
Try them out, and also, you can take advantage

01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:45.340
of the new public profile feature.

01:11:45.340 --> 01:11:46.540
I think this is a really nice feature

01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:49.460
to let employers know how your training's gone,

01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:52.020
which, I don't know, Wes, where you work,

01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:53.940
when I was in IT, training,

01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:57.900
like there was a part of my yearly, not salary,

01:11:57.900 --> 01:11:59.980
but there was a part of my yearly budget for me

01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:01.340
that included a little bit of training.

01:12:01.340 --> 01:12:02.180
Do you get anything like that?

01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:03.940
Yeah, there is a general organizational level

01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:04.780
training budget.

01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:07.100
Yeah, I think I'd be curious to know

01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:10.260
if people out there have tried this with Linux Academy,

01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:11.100
because to me-

01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:11.940
It seems like a great way.

01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:13.340
They have great team support.

01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:14.180
Exactly.

01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:15.020
It's a super easy sell.

01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:15.860
Yeah, exactly.

01:12:15.860 --> 01:12:16.700
It's a super easy sell,

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:17.700
plus it's something you can do

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:18.900
where you have full control,

01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:20.820
and it's not just fluff content.

01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:22.660
It's by people that really know Linux and care about it.

01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:24.820
They're constantly renovating the content,

01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:26.740
and with the public profiles,

01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:28.420
it's very easy at the end of the year

01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:29.700
to show what you've done.

01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:30.540
Exactly.

01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:31.380
You can show your employer.

01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:32.540
You can be like, look, this is what I've done.

01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:33.660
Here's how I've improved it.

01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:34.500
Yeah.

01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:36.260
I think it's probably,

01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:38.040
if I was still in that field,

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:40.460
it's probably my perfect solution,

01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:42.580
and I wish something like this was around back then.

01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:43.820
It's also the perfect thing for you.

01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:44.860
Like, well, I like Linux,

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:45.780
and I don't really know what I'm doing,

01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:46.700
or you have a job that doesn't,

01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:48.340
you don't get to use Linux like you'd like to.

01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:49.180
Yeah, yeah.

01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:52.620
Linux Academy is just the golden road for you.

01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:54.100
For about a year,

01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:56.300
I was using Linux Academy just to scratch itches

01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:57.700
because there were so many things I'd want to try.

01:12:57.700 --> 01:12:59.500
After I got out of doing that as a daily thing,

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:01.300
I still had these ideas that I wanted.

01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:03.460
Linux Academy with the labs and the training,

01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:05.460
it was a great resource for that.

01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:06.620
And the other thing that's kind of nice

01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:08.660
is sometimes there's a topic that I don't feel like,

01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:09.820
man, I've read the story,

01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:11.380
I've talked to the people that make it,

01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:13.500
and I'm still not wrapping my head around this,

01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:14.940
and Linux Academy has courseware on it,

01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:17.180
and the thing that's really nice about that

01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:18.020
is I look at it and I go,

01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:19.340
oh, well, that's gonna be three hours.

01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:20.700
Okay.

01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:22.500
I will spend three hours on this,

01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:25.340
and with the downloadable comprehensive study guides,

01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:27.340
the audio you can listen to,

01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:28.780
sometimes I'm podcasting this stuff.

01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:32.420
And if you have a little bit of downtime

01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:33.260
when you're commuting,

01:13:33.260 --> 01:13:35.700
maybe you're a passenger or you're on public transit,

01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:37.980
I really think the iOS and Android apps

01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:40.260
could be a great way to learn while you're on the go too.

01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:41.100
Oh, definitely.

01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:43.820
So check them out, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:45.220
That's how you support the show,

01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:47.300
and you can sign up for a seven-day free trial,

01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:48.540
and a big thank you to Linux Academy

01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:51.460
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:55.060
So last week, we were talking about the perfect keyboard,

01:13:55.060 --> 01:13:56.380
and I told you I was a little worried

01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:58.620
about getting obsessed with keyboards.

01:13:58.620 --> 01:14:00.260
And I walked away from the show,

01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:01.100
and I was like, gosh, you know,

01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:05.460
I remember this Keyboardio project.

01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:07.900
Does this ring a bell at all to you, Keyboardio?

01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:09.220
You know, that does sound really familiar.

01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:11.540
Keyboardio is pretty cool,

01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:15.020
and it's a group that Noah and I had a chance to talk to

01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:16.380
a little while ago,

01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:19.940
where they're embedding an Arduino Linux running board

01:14:19.940 --> 01:14:24.620
inside a keyboard, a solid piece of wood that they have.

01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:25.460
Look at that.

01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:26.620
Yeah, are you seeing this?

01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:27.460
Wow.

01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:29.340
Yeah, this is a really slick device.

01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:31.420
It's a split keyboard, which is ironic,

01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:32.500
because I was just recently saying

01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:36.660
this original Microsoft ergonomic QWERTY split keyboard

01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:38.460
is how I became a touch typist.

01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:39.300
Oh, really?

01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:42.140
And that was what took me up to a really fast typist,

01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:43.980
and I kinda wish I still had that.

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:48.340
This is the Model 01.

01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:49.980
They say it's the best keyboard they can make,

01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:51.500
and it's not like other keyboards.

01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:55.780
They milled the Model 01 from two blocks of solid maple.

01:14:56.660 --> 01:14:59.700
It feels good to rest your hand on the wood.

01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:02.740
Instead of shallow, uncomfortable key switches,

01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:07.340
they use glorious, tactile, mechanical key switches

01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:10.660
similar to those found in the original Apple II.

01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:15.660
They've custom sculpted each of the 64 individual keycaps

01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:18.420
on the Model 01 to gently guide your fingers

01:15:18.420 --> 01:15:19.460
to the right keys.

01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:23.260
It's heirloom construction, they say.

01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:24.220
I love that.

01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:26.340
I think this, here, I'll play a little bit of their video.

01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:27.180
This is pretty cool.

01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:28.300
How hard could this be?

01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:32.980
And then we built the best keyboard we possibly could.

01:15:32.980 --> 01:15:34.700
It's not what you'd expect from a keyboard,

01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:36.420
but people love it.

01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:38.820
Creating a keyboard is kind of a weird thing.

01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:39.940
It's been an obsession.

01:15:43.220 --> 01:15:44.660
Hi, I'm Jesse Vincent.

01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:47.220
I'm co-founder and CTO of Keyboardio.

01:15:47.220 --> 01:15:48.300
I'm Kaia Decker.

01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:50.260
I'm the CEO of Keyboardio.

01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:51.900
I'm also married to Jesse.

01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:53.700
I've actually, before we go any further,

01:15:53.700 --> 01:15:56.540
you know what, I've talked to both these individuals

01:15:56.540 --> 01:15:59.260
in person, and I've used the original prototypes,

01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:01.940
and I can tell you, they've been obsessing about this

01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:03.940
for a very long time.

01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:08.540
This is a discussion we had with them in 2015.

01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:11.140
We're here with Kaia with a Keyboardio, is that right?

01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:12.780
Keyboardio, that's us.

01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:13.620
All right, Keyboardio.

01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:17.020
So now, there is a lot of talk of different keyboards.

01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:19.780
They have the SteelSeries, and they have DOS Keyboard,

01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:21.300
and then there's the people that just use the one

01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:23.220
that comes with their OEM ship.

01:16:23.220 --> 01:16:25.900
What is it that sets Keyboardio apart?

01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:27.220
What is Keyboardio?

01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:30.740
Sure, so Keyboardio is an open hardware project,

01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:32.580
which is why we're here at Oscon,

01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:34.700
and it is a cover project,

01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:37.220
and it's designed to be used in a variety of ways.

01:16:37.220 --> 01:16:39.940
And it is a comfortable, ergonomic keyword,

01:16:39.940 --> 01:16:43.900
so it's built around the shape your hands work,

01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:47.420
so it's designed to be more comfortable to type on

01:16:47.420 --> 01:16:49.420
for long periods of time,

01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:52.140
and it also was designed by a programmer

01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:53.260
as the primary designer,

01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:56.260
so there's a lot of things that you type more often

01:16:56.260 --> 01:16:57.980
if you're a programmer, or a sys admin,

01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:00.500
or someone else who does that type of work

01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:04.140
that we've moved into especially easy-to-hit places.

01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:05.580
So, brackets, for example,

01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:09.100
I'm sure probably take a huge high priority then?

01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:10.820
Yeah, so brackets,

01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:12.860
instead of being off on the side to your pinky,

01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:15.020
they're just right above home row.

01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:17.580
You hit, you can hold down the function key,

01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:19.100
and hit U-I-O-P,

01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:21.740
and that gets you your curly and your straight brackets.

01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:26.100
WASD moves the mouse if you hold down function.

01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:29.420
H-A-K-L move the arrow keys,

01:17:29.420 --> 01:17:33.420
which if you use VI or BIM might be familiar.

01:17:33.420 --> 01:17:38.420
Yeah, and any keys that you hit and hold down,

01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:39.620
what's called cording,

01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:41.820
so control, or shift, or command,

01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:44.260
we've taken off of your pinkies and put onto your thumbs,

01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:47.140
which is a lot better for you ergonomically,

01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:50.580
and yeah, it feels comfortable,

01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:53.100
it's a little bit faster, it's better.

01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:55.100
So, you said that this was designed

01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:56.900
specifically to be more ergonomic,

01:17:56.900 --> 01:17:59.220
and you used the word typewriter,

01:17:59.220 --> 01:18:01.380
and so, can you give me a little bit of history

01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:03.700
about how the typewriter keyboard was designed?

01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:06.580
Yeah, I mean, so there's a lot of,

01:18:06.580 --> 01:18:08.420
people have written entire theses

01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:10.980
on the typewriter and the QWERTY layout.

01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:11.940
Maybe just the clip notes.

01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:16.780
Yeah, so it's, I mean, it was literally designed

01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:19.180
in the late 19th century,

01:18:19.180 --> 01:18:24.100
and so, it was based around what you could build then.

01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:26.780
So, everything was laid out in rows,

01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:31.220
touch typing was actually invented after QWERTY was invented,

01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:33.620
and so, you know, there's different stories

01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:36.220
that I don't know if any of them have been proven around.

01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:38.620
Oh, it was designed so that it was

01:18:38.620 --> 01:18:40.700
maximally inefficient to type on.

01:18:41.620 --> 01:18:44.620
One of my favorite stories is that

01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:46.940
why shift is on your pinky,

01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:49.740
as opposed to sort of in a more convenient place,

01:18:49.740 --> 01:18:52.780
and the reason is, is originally there'd been

01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:55.460
an uppercase typewriter and a lowercase typewriter,

01:18:55.460 --> 01:18:57.860
and they figured out, oh, you can literally shift

01:18:57.860 --> 01:18:59.900
the plate and the thing that the hammer strikes

01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:02.740
on a typewriter, but they'd already done their tooling

01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:04.780
for the little hammers, and so, they're like,

01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:07.300
well, we'll just put it on the side.

01:19:07.300 --> 01:19:11.180
And so, like, one lazy engineer put shift on the side there,

01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:13.980
which is why, you know, now control and command

01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:16.220
and all these other things that didn't exist

01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:19.100
when the typewriter and the QWERTY layout was invented

01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:21.860
ended up there, and so, we've, you know,

01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:24.460
moved them into a place that we think is more sensible

01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:27.860
for the way that people use keyboards and computing today.

01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:32.100
Well, regardless of, regardless of if it can be proven

01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:33.700
that the keyboard was designed to be

01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:36.220
maximally inefficient, as you put it,

01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:38.380
there's no contesting the fact that

01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:40.140
if you have a hammer that rises up,

01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:41.380
that hammer takes a certain amount of time

01:19:41.380 --> 01:19:43.320
to fall back down, so if you had two of them

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:44.900
that are crossed from each other and they hit,

01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:46.580
that'd be a bad day.

01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:49.100
So, yeah, I would imagine that some design went into,

01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:51.780
it certainly wasn't designed for optimum typing, right?

01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:53.060
Yeah, definitely.

01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:55.460
So, tell me some of the advantages of your keyboard

01:19:55.460 --> 01:19:57.860
versus, like, the programmable ones that I can buy

01:19:57.860 --> 01:19:59.980
in Best Buy or Office Max or Newegg.

01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:04.700
Sure, so it's programmable with the Arduino IDE,

01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:07.820
so we're going to have, we haven't built it yet,

01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:10.840
but have a sort of software GUI configurator,

01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:15.380
and then it's also, if you want to do really crazy things,

01:20:15.380 --> 01:20:17.980
you can, so if you want to extend it

01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:20.520
by making it wireless or Bluetooth,

01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:23.660
we give you all the pins that you have on an Arduino,

01:20:23.660 --> 01:20:25.780
so you can hook up anything that works

01:20:25.780 --> 01:20:28.420
in the Arduino ecosystem, and it'll work,

01:20:28.420 --> 01:20:30.320
play nicely with it.

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:33.260
In addition, it's mechanical keys,

01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:35.400
like the comfortable layout and so on,

01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:38.260
I think are a big benefit, but in terms of programmability,

01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:40.380
we're trying to give people as much rope

01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:42.500
as they want to play with,

01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:44.700
like actually give you firmware source

01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:46.220
as opposed to saying, well,

01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:47.980
you could remap the key here and there.

01:20:47.980 --> 01:20:50.620
It's like, it's really, truly fully programmable.

01:20:50.620 --> 01:20:51.820
So, right now, these keyboards,

01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:54.500
they're being programmed with like a config file?

01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:58.340
Yeah, so it's a couple of text files right now,

01:20:58.340 --> 01:20:59.940
is the way it works.

01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:03.160
There's, yeah, we're going to make it

01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:07.820
so that it's easy to do through a graphical interface,

01:21:07.820 --> 01:21:11.060
but yeah, the way it works inside

01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:13.980
is actually sort of astonishingly simple in some ways.

01:21:13.980 --> 01:21:15.820
I think that would appeal to a lot of Linux users.

01:21:15.820 --> 01:21:17.660
We're really used to just opening up a text file

01:21:17.660 --> 01:21:19.180
and changing the things we want.

01:21:19.180 --> 01:21:20.300
Now, where is that text file stored?

01:21:20.300 --> 01:21:21.460
Is that stored on the keyboard itself

01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:22.360
or on the computer?

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:23.620
It's stored on the keyboard itself,

01:21:23.620 --> 01:21:25.820
and one of the things, I used to be an Emacs user,

01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:28.780
and my.emacs file was full of all these

01:21:28.780 --> 01:21:30.180
weird configurations and stuff,

01:21:30.180 --> 01:21:32.700
and I liked it because I could take it with me

01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:34.140
from computer to computer,

01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:38.860
and when I moved away from using Linux and Emacs

01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:42.540
as my primary operating system and text editor,

01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:44.580
I noticed there wasn't really that

01:21:44.580 --> 01:21:48.540
for arbitrary operating system,

01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:50.420
arbitrary key bindings and stuff,

01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:52.820
and so it was important to us to not build something

01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:54.100
where you have to install a driver

01:21:54.100 --> 01:21:55.580
just to use a keyboard, right?

01:21:55.580 --> 01:21:56.860
Don't install special software

01:21:56.860 --> 01:21:58.620
just to use the keyboard to type,

01:21:58.620 --> 01:22:01.060
so any changes you make,

01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:04.140
you can put it onto the keyboard and flash it there,

01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:07.260
and it will go with you from whatever,

01:22:07.260 --> 01:22:10.540
laptop to desktop to work computer to home computer.

01:22:10.540 --> 01:22:11.820
Now, is there software that I have to have

01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:14.100
to flash the new config onto the keyboard,

01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:16.140
or can I somehow plug it in

01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:17.780
and open a text file and edit it?

01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:22.780
Right now, I think you would need to install the Arduino IDE,

01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:26.940
which is free and open and easy.

01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:28.540
I think we're planning on changing that,

01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:30.380
but that's probably a question for Jesse

01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:32.500
in terms of the actual,

01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:35.980
he's the guy who's doing the software engineering for it, so.

01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:36.920
Anything else you wanna add,

01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:37.760
or if somebody's interested

01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:39.020
in purchasing one of these fine keyboards,

01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:40.860
where they would go to pick one up?

01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:45.860
Sure, go to keyboard.io, keyboardio, or keyboardio.com.

01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:47.900
We've got a ton of info on our website.

01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:49.900
If they have any questions,

01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:53.140
we're real people answering our email,

01:22:53.140 --> 01:22:55.140
and are happy to talk with anyone about keyboards.

01:22:55.140 --> 01:22:58.700
It's fun to nerd out about it with people, so, yeah.

01:22:58.700 --> 01:22:59.540
Well, thank you very much

01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:00.420
for taking the time to speak with us.

01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:01.340
We really appreciate it.

01:23:01.340 --> 01:23:02.740
Yeah, thank you, my pleasure.

01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:04.420
So, the cool thing now that they've done

01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:06.260
with the model that's gone up for pre-order now

01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:07.580
is they've kind of gone back a little bit.

01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:09.420
They're doing it QWERTY style to begin with,

01:23:09.420 --> 01:23:10.700
so it's not all that crazy,

01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:12.980
but it still has the Arduino Linux computer in it

01:23:12.980 --> 01:23:14.620
that is fully programmable,

01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:18.620
that you can reset up and replace the keycaps if you want.

01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:19.460
And you know what?

01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:22.460
I have been recently reconsidering my position on keyboards,

01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:23.900
and since this has been something

01:23:23.900 --> 01:23:25.540
we have covered across multiple shows,

01:23:25.540 --> 01:23:27.020
it's got Linux running this thing,

01:23:27.020 --> 01:23:28.420
I think I'm gonna pre-order this.

01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:29.420
I'm gonna get it here in the studio.

01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:31.020
I'm gonna have it as my main keyboard.

01:23:31.020 --> 01:23:32.980
And so, I sent an email and said,

01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:34.360
hey guys, I wanna buy one,

01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:35.460
and I think I'm gonna do it with it.

01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:36.740
That is awesome.

01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:37.900
Yeah, I think it's nice.

01:23:37.900 --> 01:23:40.620
It's gonna look way better than your current setup?

01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:41.460
Yeah, oh my gosh.

01:23:41.460 --> 01:23:42.480
Yeah, well, this is just a free keyboard

01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:43.320
that came with the case.

01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:44.160
Oh, yeah, really?

01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:45.940
Yeah, so it's not that high-end.

01:23:45.940 --> 01:23:47.520
Yeah, it's just some, look at this,

01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:50.860
it's got, see how it says it's like bi-thermal take on there?

01:23:50.860 --> 01:23:52.100
Oh, you're right.

01:23:52.100 --> 01:23:52.940
I would never have thought,

01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:54.820
because it has like the blue backlit keys.

01:23:54.820 --> 01:23:56.300
It looks like a gamer keyboard.

01:23:56.300 --> 01:24:01.300
No, it's also got like this Borg insignia style circuitry

01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:02.480
that's just lit up.

01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:04.020
Yeah, where this is like a,

01:24:04.020 --> 01:24:05.180
this is a proper set piece.

01:24:05.180 --> 01:24:06.020
Craftsman.

01:24:06.020 --> 01:24:07.940
When I do videos inside the studio,

01:24:07.940 --> 01:24:09.400
this is something that'll catch the eye.

01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:11.100
But on top of that, this is a project

01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:13.100
we've literally been following for years now.

01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:15.700
And I don't know, I got a soft spot for keyboards

01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:19.460
that run Linux made out of wood.

01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:21.540
Don't we all?

01:24:22.820 --> 01:24:26.980
I wonder how it compares to something like ErgoDox.

01:24:26.980 --> 01:24:31.300
Yeah, or DOS keyboard, or my Logitech G19,

01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:32.980
or yeah, yeah, I'm a little nervous.

01:24:32.980 --> 01:24:33.820
I am a little nervous.

01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:37.940
Well, actually, I mean, ErgoDox is a more

01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:39.860
similar comparison, right?

01:24:39.860 --> 01:24:44.240
Because ErgoDox is a DIY split keyboard

01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:46.540
that's designed to be more ergonomic.

01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:50.900
It has the, most designs have the shifted columns,

01:24:50.900 --> 01:24:52.840
just like the Keyboardio.

01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:57.500
And they're both designed,

01:24:57.500 --> 01:25:01.180
the way I see it is Keyboardio is maybe

01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:06.180
keyboard designed by people who are passionate

01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:09.740
about keyboards for people who just like good keyboards,

01:25:09.740 --> 01:25:14.740
whereas ErgoDox is a keyboard that's designed

01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:19.860
by people who are passionate about keyboards

01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:22.220
for other people who are also really passionate

01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:23.060
about keyboards.

01:25:23.060 --> 01:25:24.860
I think Keyboardio is-

01:25:24.860 --> 01:25:26.860
Not until recently, I think-

01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:30.620
At $329 before you pay for fancy shipping,

01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:33.700
Keyboardio is for people who want something

01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:34.980
special and unique.

01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:36.940
It fits that category.

01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:38.740
Like I'm looking at their keyboard layout

01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:42.060
and it's a little different to the LED light controls

01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:43.940
where I would expect my tilde to be.

01:25:43.940 --> 01:25:45.180
And there's things like that,

01:25:45.180 --> 01:25:47.020
they're gonna be a little bit of an adjustment.

01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:48.100
So we'll see how it goes.

01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:49.300
But it feels like it's,

01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:53.160
if you are a collector of fine art,

01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:54.740
this would be sort of equivalent to that.

01:25:54.740 --> 01:25:56.980
And it's much cheaper than that.

01:25:56.980 --> 01:25:59.180
And I like that it's open design,

01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:02.980
it's open hardware, and it's easily reprogrammable.

01:26:02.980 --> 01:26:06.700
So there could be a potential, this is my thought,

01:26:06.700 --> 01:26:08.100
there could be a potential for this

01:26:08.100 --> 01:26:10.860
to be a very nice control surface for OBS.

01:26:10.860 --> 01:26:11.700
The OBS upstream-

01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:15.100
You've got your crazy hotkeys keyed in there, oh man.

01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:16.940
OBS upstream is working on

01:26:16.940 --> 01:26:19.220
some pretty sophisticated hotkey support.

01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:21.860
And if I end up deciding that this is a no good,

01:26:21.860 --> 01:26:23.740
this is bunk as a keyboard,

01:26:23.740 --> 01:26:25.980
and the fact that we can replace the keycaps

01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:28.220
and the underlying Arduino is reprogrammable,

01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:31.660
this I feel like will be a pretty good OBS controller too.

01:26:31.660 --> 01:26:34.100
So I kind of feel like I am kind of in a nice position

01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:35.260
to test it out and see how it goes.

01:26:35.260 --> 01:26:36.620
And I'll report back.

01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:38.780
The keyboard thing has been fun.

01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:41.700
Mohs and Rath, you found a G19 in Canada?

01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:42.540
Where?

01:26:43.620 --> 01:26:45.580
Actually, I can't find it again.

01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:47.700
I actually had found it on Kijiji.

01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:50.020
I'm currently looking as we speak.

01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:52.460
It was in Port Hope, Ontario.

01:26:52.460 --> 01:26:55.220
I'm completely serious.

01:26:55.220 --> 01:26:56.900
I found it last week and we were sitting there

01:26:56.900 --> 01:26:57.740
talking about it,

01:26:57.740 --> 01:27:01.340
because my friends say with some truth

01:27:01.340 --> 01:27:03.540
that I have a hoarding problem,

01:27:03.540 --> 01:27:06.300
which has translated to a purchasing problem

01:27:06.300 --> 01:27:09.820
of specifically Logitech keyboards.

01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:13.340
And I have a G15, a G11, a G105.

01:27:13.340 --> 01:27:17.420
I gave another friend of mine a G105, a G110.

01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:20.260
There might be another one around here somewhere.

01:27:20.260 --> 01:27:21.180
I don't know.

01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:22.020
Love it.

01:27:22.020 --> 01:27:25.340
But I actually did find one.

01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:28.460
And if I find it again before the end of the show

01:27:28.460 --> 01:27:30.900
or even shortly after the show, I will let you know.

01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:32.540
I'm really in the search mode for it right now.

01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:34.980
Nice, stay tuned and find out.

01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:36.940
You know, I think that's sort of an interesting note

01:27:36.940 --> 01:27:37.780
to end on right there.

01:27:37.780 --> 01:27:39.180
And Mohs and Rath, don't beat up on yourself

01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:42.380
because it's not that you are a hoarder,

01:27:42.380 --> 01:27:47.220
it's that you are documenting a precious time of development

01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:48.060
in our society.

01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:50.220
In 20 years, you'll have a museum on your hands.

01:27:50.220 --> 01:27:53.300
Yeah, you are at the forefront of witnessing

01:27:53.300 --> 01:27:55.980
some of the most rapid progress in humanity.

01:27:55.980 --> 01:27:57.460
And you can't feel too bad about that.

01:27:57.460 --> 01:27:58.940
At least you can tell yourself that

01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:01.060
and try to self-rationalize with that line.

01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:01.900
You're welcome.

01:28:01.900 --> 01:28:03.260
Hey, if you'd like to join us live next week,

01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:06.140
go over to jblive.tv on a Tuesday.

01:28:06.140 --> 01:28:08.980
There is some calendar changes coming up in the future

01:28:08.980 --> 01:28:09.820
because I'll be traveling.

01:28:09.820 --> 01:28:11.980
So check out jubilabroadcasting.com slash calendar

01:28:11.980 --> 01:28:13.380
where you can find the live times

01:28:13.380 --> 01:28:14.820
and get it converted in your local time.

01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:18.460
I'm at chrislas, linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:20.740
All of that shenanigans and a post show

01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:22.060
right here next week.

01:28:22.060 --> 01:28:46.020
Put it down in the comments below.

01:28:46.020 --> 01:29:15.060
All right, let's go pick a title, JBtitles.com.

01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:19.420
Can I just say I'm loving this keyboard thing we're doing in this last episode?

01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:20.420
I know, it's funny.

01:29:20.420 --> 01:29:21.420
It's really fun.

01:29:21.420 --> 01:29:23.780
It's been totally organic, and it is kind of fun to talk about this because it's something

01:29:23.780 --> 01:29:28.460
we all use, and I can't believe I found another keyboard that runs Linux.

01:29:28.460 --> 01:29:29.460
I got to get it.

01:29:29.460 --> 01:29:31.500
If I find it, it's been years since I found another keyboard that runs Linux.

01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:32.500
You have to have it.

01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:33.500
I like it.

01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:40.660
Cow tipping is not a bad, although we've already had cow in Linux action show, but JBtitles.com,

01:29:40.660 --> 01:29:46.660
making IT steampunk, making it snappy, snap, snap, the snappy snaps, I don't know.

01:29:46.660 --> 01:29:47.660
Are we feeling that?

01:29:47.660 --> 01:29:49.000
Are we feeling that?

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.000
That's a lot of snap.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Mozan, did you find it before we get out of here?

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.660
Did you find it?

01:29:53.660 --> 01:29:54.660
Oh.

01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:57.660
Get it out of here.

01:29:57.660 --> 01:29:58.660
That'd be a negative.

01:29:58.660 --> 01:30:06.620
Yeah, we have a couple of different Telegram threads that we're using for conversations

01:30:06.620 --> 01:30:10.220
that are related to what might work on user error or something like that.

01:30:10.220 --> 01:30:15.480
And so, sometimes things come up, and we're like, man, this is a show topic, but they

01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:20.980
come up a week before we record user error, and by the time we sit down to record user

01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:23.700
error, even with the Telegram thread there, we can't find it.

01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:24.700
We can't remember it.

01:30:24.700 --> 01:30:25.700
Same thing with Slack and similar things.

01:30:25.700 --> 01:30:26.700
Yeah, yeah.

01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:29.820
So in Telegram, there is a to-do bot.

01:30:29.820 --> 01:30:32.420
So why not use this bot to say to-do?

01:30:32.420 --> 01:30:38.580
Use a to-do list manager as topic show manager, basically, because that pretty much translates.

01:30:38.580 --> 01:30:43.780
And so I added a bot, and I start working with it, and then my first time I work with

01:30:43.780 --> 01:30:44.780
it, I get a response.

01:30:44.780 --> 01:30:48.580
And then after that, I never could get the bot to do anything, and I have no idea if

01:30:48.580 --> 01:30:53.980
the server the bot runs is offline, if there's some sort of account issue with me.

01:30:53.980 --> 01:30:56.260
Other bots seem to be working okay.

01:30:56.260 --> 01:30:57.940
I have no way to troubleshoot.

01:30:57.940 --> 01:30:59.740
There's no error message returned to me.

01:30:59.740 --> 01:31:00.740
Not a phone number to call.

01:31:00.740 --> 01:31:03.900
And it's like computers work with ones and zeros.

01:31:03.900 --> 01:31:06.700
So send me back a one or a zero.

01:31:06.700 --> 01:31:07.700
Don't just say nothing.

01:31:07.700 --> 01:31:08.700
Yeah, right.

01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:09.700
I don't understand it.

01:31:09.700 --> 01:31:13.420
You've got to give him credit.

01:31:13.420 --> 01:31:16.140
He made the jump right as the new MacBooks are about to be announced.

01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:17.140
I know.

01:31:17.140 --> 01:31:18.140
I was going to say.

01:31:18.140 --> 01:31:19.140
No, he's like, screw that.

01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:20.140
I'm moving forward with this.

01:31:20.140 --> 01:31:21.140
Homey don't play anymore.

01:31:21.140 --> 01:31:26.060
Is there a big TLDR for why he wanted to switch platforms?

01:31:26.060 --> 01:31:31.040
The future of platforms for independent software development is probably in the hands of Linux

01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:33.340
and many of those servers on the cloud run Ubuntu.

01:31:33.340 --> 01:31:34.340
Yeah, there you go.

01:31:34.340 --> 01:31:41.700
I think he's placing a big bet on AI and bots, AI slash bots, to sell bots as business contracts

01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:42.900
to develop software.

01:31:42.900 --> 01:31:47.500
Also, I think he also figures, I mean, you'd have to listen to yesterday's quarter radio

01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:54.980
to get the full context, but I think he also figures that the app ecosystem is pretty commoditized

01:31:54.980 --> 01:31:55.980
now.

01:31:55.980 --> 01:31:56.980
Sure.

01:31:56.980 --> 01:32:01.660
And most good apps that are worth their salt anyways have a huge back end infrastructure.

01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:03.000
Yeah, absolutely.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:09.760
So why not focus as a primary on the back end, on Linux, running on Linux, and then

01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:14.420
offer iOS and Android apps as part of the entire package, because so far his business

01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:19.520
has primarily been around developing apps for iOS and Android and some Mac desktop apps.

01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:20.820
With back ends when needed.

01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:21.820
Yeah.

01:32:21.820 --> 01:32:25.340
And so now he's going to pivot and do back ends as the primary focus, and hey, as part

01:32:25.340 --> 01:32:29.680
of the entire package, we'll also write the web front end, the iOS front end, the Android

01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:30.680
front end.

01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:31.680
That makes sense.

01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:34.900
So all those things are going with progressive web apps or React Native and those kinds of

01:32:34.900 --> 01:32:35.900
things.

01:32:35.900 --> 01:32:39.900
And so in his mind, he's like, well, why do I need to spend $2,800 on a MacBook Pro when

01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:45.140
I could spend $800 on a Lemur and develop on the same OS that I'm going to be deploying

01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:46.140
on?

01:32:46.140 --> 01:32:50.180
And I think the fact that Docker is just right there is a useful thing for him because Docker

01:32:50.180 --> 01:32:55.060
allows him to experiment and sort of rapidly try things.

01:32:55.060 --> 01:32:57.020
The cost of changing things up is like nothing.

01:32:57.020 --> 01:32:59.780
And you know, I've been saying this for a while, I really think there's going to be

01:32:59.780 --> 01:33:05.460
a lot of server-side developers and web developers that look at the Mac platform and say, OK,

01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:09.820
well, this new MacBook, yeah, it's got a fingerprint sensor, it's got this OLED bar on here that

01:33:09.820 --> 01:33:14.420
changes for the few people who wrote software that support it.

01:33:14.420 --> 01:33:18.300
But Mac OS itself is not going in a direction I want, it's not getting to be stable, it's

01:33:18.300 --> 01:33:21.100
not taking advantage of the Unix underpinnings the way I wish it would.

01:33:21.100 --> 01:33:22.620
Yeah, it hasn't become a better Unix.

01:33:22.620 --> 01:33:24.020
No, it's not at all.

01:33:24.020 --> 01:33:26.140
It's gotten to be worse.

01:33:26.140 --> 01:33:28.380
And so I think when you're looking, well, geez, I'm just going to be creating apps for

01:33:28.380 --> 01:33:37.380
the cloud, cloud, anyways, why not get hardware that gets iterated faster, there's more choice,

01:33:37.380 --> 01:33:42.580
and the desktop OS is agnostic as to which vendor I go with.

01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:45.780
Because even in that scenario, you could eventually choose to go back to the MacBook hardware

01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:46.780
if you wanted to.

01:33:46.780 --> 01:33:47.860
Yeah, sure, definitely.

01:33:47.860 --> 01:33:52.900
So I don't, I'm not, I think this is going to be a huge win for Linux, sort of like a

01:33:52.900 --> 01:33:55.860
slow boil scale.

01:33:55.860 --> 01:33:57.260
Slow boil scale, I like that.

01:33:57.260 --> 01:33:58.260
We will see.

01:33:58.260 --> 01:33:59.180
Linux slow boil.
