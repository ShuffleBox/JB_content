1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
Did you share those notes today there, Mr. Chris?

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,400
Now, okay.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,400
What?

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,400
There are no notes?

5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,400
Oh, beautiful.

6
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,400
Beautiful.

7
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,400
That's a good part to start the show right there then.

8
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:26,680
This is Linux Unplugged episode 176 for December 20th, 2016.

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:31,120
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's currently celebrating its

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,680
last live production of the year.

11
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,680
My name is Chris.

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,680
My name is Wes.

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,680
Hello, Wes.

14
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,660
There is a tradition on the Jupiter Broadcasting Network that we don't always choose to take

15
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,000
advantage of, but from time to time, and I feel like this is the year we're going to

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
do it.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Oh, yeah.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,800
No rules shows, the last live show.

19
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,800
Anything could happen.

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,800
These are probably going to be awful, and so it's why we never do it like this.

21
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:57,040
We never do it like this, but if there was any show to go, no rules, no prep, it's this

22
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,040
show.

23
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:03,000
And it kind of worked out, because I have this debilitating carpal tunnel in both my

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
hands right now.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Oh, no.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,140
I don't mean to be laughing.

27
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,140
It's the worst thing ever.

28
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,140
The only way to deal.

29
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,140
Yeah, it is.

30
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,120
I can't even lift up the bowl of cereal or put my seatbelt on.

31
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,600
So I thought, well, what a great day not to have to put a dock together.

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,600
Yeah, right?

33
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,600
No typing.

34
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,720
What a great excuse to just not worry about it.

35
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,760
So coming up on this week's episode, we're going to throw out the playbook.

36
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,340
We're going to look at the worst of 2016.

37
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,280
What was the worst in Linux in 2016?

38
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,560
We're going to talk about some of that.

39
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,040
Then we're going to look forward to 2017.

40
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,200
Jack Wallins got an article that actually got me thinking about what might be coming

41
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,240
down the pipe.

42
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,480
Not a full-fledged predictions episode, but I want to give the virtual lug a chance to

43
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,200
chime in before we sail into 2017.

44
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:50,980
And then, at the end of the show, like a maniac, I'm going to hand the reins over to Noah,

45
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:56,520
and he's going to answer some calls and chat small business and GNU slash Linux.

46
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,520
I've heard of that.

47
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,520
Yeah, it's new.

48
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,520
And they're going to talk about it on the phone.

49
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,080
You can just get in there and take calls.

50
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,880
So why don't we get started by bringing in that virtual lug?

51
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,880
Hello, Mama Robe.

52
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,880
Hello, hello.

53
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,040
Hello, hello, hello.

54
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:17,560
And hey, guys, thanks for being here on our last episode of the year.

55
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,240
It's not really the last one, because tomorrow or next Tuesday, we'll have a clip show of

56
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,240
all the different stuff throughout the year, which is a great one, by the way.

57
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,880
If you want to spread Linux Unplugged for the holidays, toss them a clip show.

58
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,880
You know it's going to be good.

59
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,280
It's all your favorite moments.

60
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,920
It's going to be passable, though.

61
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,920
I'm kidding.

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,920
It's going to be good.

63
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,040
You won't hate yourself after.

64
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,200
The beard's been sprinkling his beard magic all over it.

65
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,360
Yeah, so I didn't want to have any rules.

66
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,440
I wanted to let the mumble room and the conversation go any direction it goes.

67
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,800
So I thought I'd kind of cue us up with a couple of things.

68
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,660
And then I'm going to do the reads for all the sponsors here in a minute.

69
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,360
Just do them all right here at the top of the show.

70
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360
All right.

71
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,360
And we're just going to do them.

72
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,680
And then however long the show goes, it goes.

73
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,680
And we're going to call it good.

74
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,680
We're going to call it good.

75
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,200
Hey, check in with Grand Forks, North Dakota.

76
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,200
Noah, are you on the line?

77
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,200
Are you there?

78
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
Yes, sir.

79
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,200
Over.

80
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,200
Over.

81
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,200
Mr. Chris.

82
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,200
That might be a bit excessive.

83
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,400
I may be on my phone, but I don't think we have to I don't think we have to have like

84
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,800
a transition of speaking and thinking.

85
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,440
I think we can handle that.

86
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,440
Over.

87
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,440
10-4 good, buddy.

88
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,440
Yeah.

89
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,440
10-4, Noah.

90
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,440
Get out the telegraph.

91
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,440
Get out the telegraph.

92
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,440
Come on, Noah.

93
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,440
So what's going on over there?

94
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,800
Are you are you getting set up to take calls here in a little bit on the show?

95
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,200
Well, I spent I spent a little bit of time getting some levels tweaked and getting some

96
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,200
equipment set up.

97
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,760
I'm actually on my phone because I've used up all of my audio interfaces in the studio

98
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,520
and I don't want to monkey with any of the levels, but.

99
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,520
Oh, my God.

100
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,520
Okay.

101
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,520
All right.

102
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,520
Good.

103
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,520
Well, it's setting the bar high.

104
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,240
So what we're going to do is we're going to shut down production at some point and then

105
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,720
do a quick little swap-a-roo and bring up Grand Forks.

106
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,720
Hold on a second.

107
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,720
Where's my here?

108
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,600
Let's this is just something that I just so we have the context in which Noah is working

109
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
right now.

110
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,520
I feel like it'd be useful for us to know what's the temperature in Grand Forks, North

111
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,080
Dakota right now.

112
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,200
It's twenty nine degrees in Grand Forks right now.

113
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,200
Not bad.

114
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,200
No.

115
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,200
No.

116
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,200
Geez.

117
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,200
Congratulations.

118
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,400
No, I'm really happy for you, man.

119
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,400
That's some good news.

120
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,400
So, yeah.

121
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,400
Okay.

122
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,400
Good.

123
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,400
I feel like we got a good show.

124
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,400
We got a good show on our hands here today.

125
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,480
I'm ready to dive into the worst of 2016.

126
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:29,560
And I thought I had I had like I think what I want to do is I wanted I want to set the

127
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,160
bar as to what I think was the worst thing that could have happened to a tech company

128
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,160
in 2016.

129
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,520
And then we want to talk within the context of Linux about that.

130
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,600
So I've got a couple of ideas, but I feel like once we really get the ball rolling,

131
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
that's when we're going to get some stuff.

132
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,640
So that'll probably be thanks to the Mumble Room.

133
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,760
They'll probably be doing some of the heavy lifting there.

134
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,760
But why don't we.

135
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,760
So let's do this.

136
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,760
Are you ready, Wes?

137
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,760
Oh, I'm ready.

138
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,840
Do you feel like you've bought you prepared your body for this?

139
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,840
Well, we'll see.

140
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,160
Well, there's only one way to find out.

141
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,160
That's by doing.

142
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,480
So let's thank the folks that sponsored this show all year long.

143
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,080
And I really appreciate Linux Academy and I appreciate those of you who visited Linux

144
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,980
Academy dot com slash unplugged this year or those of you who plan to soon Linux Academy

145
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,780
dot com slash unplugged.

146
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:15,000
That's where you go to sign up for a platform to train you all about Linux.

147
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,880
And when you go to Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged, you can get a seven day free trial.

148
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,200
Courseware is great.

149
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,280
It's constantly being improved.

150
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,520
The virtualization system is slick.

151
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,920
They spin up these systems on demand when you need them.

152
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,900
The servers match the distributions you've chosen for the courseware automatically.

153
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,240
They have content availability planning.

154
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,920
They have instructors you can speak to when you need actual human help.

155
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,840
But hot off the presses right here, Wes.

156
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,320
This week, got an email.

157
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,080
I mean, I got a press announcement.

158
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,900
No, it's just an email I got here from Anthony and he says, here's a couple of new courses

159
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,960
we've got working on over at Linux Academy.

160
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,080
Machine learning with Azure, PowerShell Essentials.

161
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,640
Now this, these two first ones right here are fascinating to me because they are on

162
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,440
Linux Academy's Linux platform.

163
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,360
It's using these tools in combination with Linux, which that really, if that doesn't

164
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,200
tell you 2016, right?

165
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,680
It doesn't that the fact that Linux Academy.

166
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,680
PowerShell on Linux.

167
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,680
On Linux Academy.

168
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,040
This is really, I mean, when I saw this, I thought, wow, Linux.

169
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,880
And it also tells you how they stay up to date with what stuff people are actually looking

170
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,880
for to learn.

171
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,880
Right on the bulls.

172
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,280
They also have launched their iOS and Android apps this year, which is a great way to train

173
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,880
when you're on the go.

174
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,120
And they're launching serverless concepts, which was cool because they started with a

175
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,000
live stream where you can join the instructors from Linux Academy, a couple of different

176
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,680
ones, as they discuss serverless concepts and get you started with that.

177
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,640
They have new live labs to get you started with AWS.

178
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,200
This is one of the things I think is really great because it's not just the essentials.

179
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,440
It's like the stuff that is really big high level services stuff like AWS and Azure and

180
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:51,040
OpenStack and Docker and the things that, you know, look really great on a resume too.

181
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,480
And they help you get those certifications you might need as well.

182
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,840
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

183
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,100
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the unplugged program.

184
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,800
Also thank you to Ting for sponsoring the show this year.

185
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,800
Wow.

186
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
Linux.ting.com.

187
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,800
I love being able to say that.

188
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,800
Go there and save.

189
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,080
You know, the reason why Ting has been a sponsor for so long on the show now is really simple

190
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,480
economics.

191
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:19,740
This kind of mobile model makes a lot of sense and our audience gets it.

192
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,980
And so they keep going to Ting because it saves them money.

193
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,520
And so because Ting keeps getting customers, they keep sponsoring us.

194
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,000
Linux.ting.com.

195
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,320
It's a great relationship because what we're trying to tell you about here isn't something

196
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,360
that's some big scam.

197
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,040
It's not some big complicated system or it's not some sort of incentive program where I

198
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,640
undermine net neutrality but I do it with a leather jacket so I tell you it's cool.

199
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,360
It is a really good mobile carrier that has CDMA and GSM networks.

200
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,520
You pick which one works better for you and you pay for what you use.

201
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,480
Minutes, messages, megabytes.

202
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,480
Whatever you use, that's all you owe.

203
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,840
And six dollars for the line plus Uncle Sam's take.

204
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,360
Uncle Sam's got to have a little percentage.

205
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,360
It varies in your area.

206
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,520
He's got his hands in your pockets.

207
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,140
But for me, it's usually almost always under 40 bucks.

208
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,240
Almost always.

209
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,960
Every now and then, like when I'm on the road or something like that, it might go up to

210
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,280
55, 60 bucks for three phones.

211
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,080
For three phones with no contract.

212
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,080
I love it.

213
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,120
You can bring a device or you can go grab one.

214
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,600
Go to Linux.ting.com and a big thanks to Ting for sponsoring.

215
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,520
You see, when I say it like that, it changes it up.

216
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,320
It's like a fresh new code.

217
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,360
And if you weren't a long time listener, you might not have any idea what I'm saying.

218
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,200
So it's only for the people in the know.

219
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,480
Alright, and then our last sponsor and one that's also been with us all year and I'm

220
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,440
super, super thankful to DigitalOcean.

221
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,800
Now DigitalOcean, the one thing that you can really tell about DigitalOcean is it's just

222
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,680
about everybody in our audience has a reason to use DigitalOcean.

223
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,040
Charem's always talking about it.

224
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,200
People write in the emails.

225
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,960
We're not only reading the emails that talk about DigitalOcean or something like that.

226
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:54,720
It's just what people are using because it's such a simple and fast and easy way to spin

227
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,840
up a Linux system on their great infrastructure in less than 55 seconds.

228
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,920
All SSDs for the storage, 40 gigabit e-connections to the hypervisors.

229
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,920
They run Linux, of course.

230
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,120
It's KVM for the virtualizer.

231
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,400
I love that.

232
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:13,920
And if you've ever wanted to see what a real nice web application can be to manage actual

233
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,560
really high end server type things, DigitalOcean's got the proto example.

234
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,680
You go there, it's like, oh, oh, they managed to put Johnny Ive in a box.

235
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,920
They put Johnny Ive in a box and he spit out this interface and that's why Apple hasn't

236
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,200
gotten anything for years now out of him because he's too busy working for DigitalOcean.

237
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,040
It's the only thing that makes sense.

238
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,440
Plus their API is built for humans.

239
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,320
They really did something good here and there's so much crazy great open source built around

240
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,720
that.

241
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
Go check them out.

242
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,120
DigitalOcean.com, just use a promo code from us for you.

243
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,120
D-O-Unplugged.

244
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,680
One word, lowercase, apply to your account after you get started or even if you had an

245
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,320
account for a while, you get $10 credit.

246
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,520
DigitalOcean.com, thanks for using the promo code D-O-Unplugged.

247
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:06,140
Okay, now the rest of the show is open for however the conversation goes.

248
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:10,080
So let's start talking about the worst of 2016.

249
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,520
Now this next example is not Linux specific but I thought it set such a good benchmark.

250
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,920
Like it can't get worse than this.

251
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,280
So this is the worst, this is the very worst of 2016.

252
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,280
Now the what?

253
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,280
Go.

254
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,280
I said go.

255
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,280
Frightening headline about your smartphone.

256
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,920
Samsung delaying shipments of its Galaxy Note 7 amid reports of exploding batteries and

257
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,120
that announcement sending their stock plummeting.

258
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,480
ABC's Rebecca Jarvis is here with the latest.

259
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,480
Good morning, Rebecca.

260
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,480
Good morning, Amy.

261
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,040
Multiple consumers have now complained of explosions of their Galaxy Note 7 devices.

262
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,040
Take a look at this.

263
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,000
Some are sharing these pictures of their burnt out phones online.

264
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,920
Samsung says that shipments are being delayed due to additional tests being conducted for

265
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,480
product quality and there's no word on exactly what caused the problems.

266
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,960
When you go to the airport today still, you hear warnings about how you can't bring a

267
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:04,920
Note 7, a Samsung Galaxy Note 7 on the plane and it's played over the loudspeaker at the

268
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,320
entire airport.

269
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,320
That is embarrassing.

270
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,200
There's no, I mean, Apple had a bad MacBook.

271
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,400
There's a lot of stuff that hasn't come out of Google that we were hoping for.

272
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,600
But nobody really had products that were blown up in your pockets like Samsung did.

273
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,120
And what's interesting now is we do have kind of a picture of what happened.

274
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,120
Did you hear about this?

275
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,120
No.

276
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,120
I'm behind the times.

277
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,320
A third party contractor was brought in by Samsung to investigate what was causing the

278
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:34,560
explosions and their analysis was is that Samsung left insufficient room for battery

279
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,160
growth when the battery heats up, it expands and when the battery cools, it contracts.

280
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,560
But when it's doing that super fast charging, it expands because it gets hot.

281
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,920
And when it, I guess, part of what caused the problem is it would expand, breach, some

282
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,020
sort of rupture happened and then I don't know, maybe, I don't know what happens from

283
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,280
there that causes it to explode, but that was the core issue.

284
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,280
Undefined behavior.

285
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,280
Woo.

286
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,720
And you know, Samsung, they just really didn't have a response out of the gate.

287
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,720
No.

288
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,720
No.

289
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,760
It really did not feel like they were, you know, they didn't embrace it.

290
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,520
They weren't out there already with the report.

291
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,800
It took a long time to feel like they were really responding or trying to respond.

292
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,800
Yeah.

293
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:15,400
I tell you, that is, that is a, that is the worst case for a company like Samsung.

294
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:21,980
And it, it allowed for like the Apple iPhone to essentially be totally lackluster without

295
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:27,000
a headphone jack and still do very well because people are like, well, I'm done.

296
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm done with this.

297
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm sure Google was happy about that.

298
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Yeah.

299
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
The Pixel release.

300
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,760
William just randomly wanted to jump in there and say hi, I think.

301
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,760
So are you there, William?

302
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,760
Are you good?

303
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,760
Are you okay?

304
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,760
Are you all right?

305
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,760
I think something happened.

306
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,760
We need you in 2017.

307
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,760
Don't hurt yourself.

308
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,760
I think something happened.

309
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,760
I think somebody just busted in William's house.

310
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,760
Are you okay?

311
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,760
Are you all right?

312
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,920
It was a Samsung Galaxy, though.

313
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,920
I think so.

314
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,920
Yep.

315
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,920
Just exploded right there.

316
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,920
Jeez.

317
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,920
What a shame.

318
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,360
So I want to transition from general technology and I want to, I don't really, it's not, I'm

319
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,680
not here to talk about Samsung.

320
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,680
You killed that show this year.

321
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,680
Remember?

322
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,680
That's right.

323
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,680
Hey, where's the bell?

324
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,680
Where are you?

325
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,680
Come on, Wes.

326
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,680
That's a...

327
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,680
You're right.

328
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,680
Bell worthy.

329
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,680
That was bell worthy.

330
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,120
Okay, I thought maybe we'd stop, we'd just stop right there and just talk Linux and talk

331
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,480
worst of 2016.

332
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,640
And I don't, I don't want this to be a bitch fest.

333
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,700
This is just like, you know, this is in, this is kind of in good fun, really.

334
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,700
It's in good fun.

335
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,000
And there's, there are a few that we could start with.

336
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,400
And I thought maybe to do that, we'd look at the 2017 list that Jack Wallen put together.

337
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,640
Because this one jumped out at me right at the top.

338
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:33,320
Canonical finally exits the phone market.

339
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,440
He just went right for it.

340
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,440
Wow.

341
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,440
He says, I give Canonical credit.

342
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,440
They tried hard.

343
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,000
Unfortunately, Ubuntu phone missed the mark on nearly every possible level.

344
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,080
The idea for interface was the idea for the interface was doomed from the beginning, speaking

345
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,080
in past tense.

346
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,080
Wow, yeah.

347
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,080
In past tense here.

348
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,800
And it couldn't gain any traction in the already saturated market.

349
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,080
However, I do believe their dream of convergence can be fixed.

350
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,200
And it begins with Android instead of focusing so much effort on getting Ubuntu phone in

351
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,320
a position where it can make the convergence between desktop and mobile.

352
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,360
Canonical might well sell their sites or I'm sorry, set their sites on integrating this

353
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,600
functionality into Android.

354
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,680
Regardless of what happens with convergence in 2017, we will see Canonical return their

355
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,320
focus to what they do best the desktop and server market.

356
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,560
What do you think of that?

357
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,560
Is that too strong?

358
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,560
Or do you?

359
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,960
Boy, I don't know.

360
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,240
It's not original, is it?

361
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,120
This is not the first journalist in the Linux and open source.

362
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,480
I think I saw these written in 2015.

363
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,100
About 2016 to definitely, yeah.

364
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,320
And I've seen other journalists say it for next year as well.

365
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,320
And to some extent, it's true, because it's been announced that, you know, Canonical are

366
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:48,560
stepping back from working on mobile devices to consolidate all of the work that's been

367
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,300
done on unity eight around the desktop.

368
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,440
So that will take some time.

369
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,160
Whether or not there's another device this year, I don't know for mobile.

370
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,520
But it's now bringing all of that work that happened in unit unity eight to the desktop.

371
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,720
And everyone's working on that right now.

372
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,720
Yeah.

373
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:12,880
So to me, it feels a bit hollow, it feels to actually, here's a better way.

374
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,200
But to me, it feels a bit cookie cutter.

375
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,880
Like it's a it's a it's a cookie cutter argument that somebody else has already made a stencil

376
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,040
for and you can stamp it out and you can mold it into your project or your article pretty

377
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,040
easily.

378
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,600
But what I'm trying to get at here is it feels like it sort of it sort of misses the mark

379
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,240
on a couple of things in its analysis.

380
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:39,720
First of all, it sort of seems to not acknowledge the work that mobile force canonical to think

381
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,800
about like transactional updates, right and snap packages made a lot of the reason for

382
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,680
for mirror right was involved with their mobile stuff.

383
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,440
And also, I think the other thing that if canonical Oh, hold on, I'll come back to that

384
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,440
because that mirror thing is a great point.

385
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,440
I want to the other thing that I think that sort of it underplays is their their total

386
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:07,480
refocusing and retooling around cutie are cute, which is going to long term make a huge,

387
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,120
huge differentiator for the Unity desktop.

388
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,760
Like it's going to be a it's going to be its own thing that developers will go after.

389
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:20,920
It's going to be the Unity desktop is going to stand out from gnome and plasma, not because

390
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:26,020
of the toolkit that it's using, but because it will not be like any other desktop.

391
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,640
Unity seven already stands out as its own unique thing.

392
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,920
But in most cases, it feels like a gnome desktop.

393
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,560
It feels like a GTK environment.

394
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,760
I believe once Unity eight is in a good usable spot on the desktop, and I don't know when

395
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,760
that'll be.

396
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,760
But when it arrives, I believe it will stand out as a completely, totally differentiating

397
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,760
product.

398
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,760
canonical going their own way.

399
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,760
Yeah.

400
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,760
And not in a bad way.

401
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,760
No, not in a bad way.

402
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:54,760
I think it really undersells the massive tide change that is happening, that it's only happening

403
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:59,560
because of the work and investment in mobile.

404
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,880
And I don't even think you necessarily kill off mobile, you just make it as part of a

405
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,880
wider strategy.

406
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,800
So you take the crap you've built to support that, and you integrate it with the wider

407
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,900
product strategy.

408
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:14,680
So that rather than pushing mobile mobile first, it's a hey, also mobile.

409
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:20,400
It's a it's it's it's this tool set, this platform will work across this device range

410
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,300
this it's because don't even think of it in hardware terms, think of it more in terms

411
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,300
of screen size.

412
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:28,200
That's what what do you think of that wimpy that way off the mark?

413
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,960
Nope, no, it's not way off the mark at all.

414
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,960
Yeah.

415
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,960
Okay.

416
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,560
So that's so that's the I think it's possible we could say they're exiting the phone market

417
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:41,160
in terms of additional partnerships with your aggressive making a continuing aggressive

418
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,160
partnerships with hardware.

419
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,280
What to expect in the next I don't know if you can even say that all I know is that engineering

420
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,380
is focused around putting everything that's happened in unity eight to the desktop right

421
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,560
now.

422
00:17:53,560 --> 00:18:00,700
And as far as I know, the work on mobile has just been paused to allow that to happen.

423
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,480
As in mobile software development has been paused.

424
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,480
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that another device manufacturer couldn't come along, want to

425
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,840
do a device and the platforms there and ready to use.

426
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,640
There's been there's been an interesting shift happening.

427
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,720
And I wonder where the market is going to be once unity eight arrives for end users

428
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:23,920
because in the background, there is there's a big shift happening with the popularity

429
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,400
of Ubuntu Mate.

430
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:33,200
There is a lot of energy around projects like solace right now and elementary OS.

431
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,840
There is a lot of energy and discussion there where there is some especially in the case

432
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,880
of elementary OS and in the case of Mate there is some there is definitely some direct connections

433
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,440
to Ubuntu.

434
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,480
So they're not totally their own things, but they're kind of gaining speed and popularity

435
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:56,600
and size as the more more and more the desktops people are interested in what the things people

436
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,800
are talking about things with high momentum.

437
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,880
So where's that going to be once unity eight actually arrives?

438
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,920
Is it going to be too late?

439
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:07,040
Are people going to have moved on or will it will we all be ready for something fresh

440
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,040
again?

441
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,040
I don't know.

442
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,680
I think it's interesting, too, because last year we were talking about this.

443
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,680
Sorry.

444
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,680
Go on.

445
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,600
I think the community talks about not liking unity, but I think a lot more people actually

446
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,000
use unity than don't overall in the grand scheme of how many people use Ubuntu and don't

447
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,160
care enough to change their D or even if they could.

448
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:30,960
I think I would argue that I would I would argue that unity has the best multi monitor

449
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,320
sport of any desktop operating system out there.

450
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,760
And this is coming from somebody who just dumped unity for no.

451
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,760
Yeah, there's that.

452
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,920
I would say the only people who don't like unity are fussy Linux users because every

453
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,080
regular person I've ever given it to, they have two impressions.

454
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,080
Yeah, this is great.

455
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,080
It works fine.

456
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,080
Why are you asking?

457
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,080
It's fine.

458
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,080
Right.

459
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,080
They don't have the concept of that.

460
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,080
They really have a choice.

461
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,080
Right.

462
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,080
No, I've had that exact same experience.

463
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,080
Yeah, I just know.

464
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,260
And I just put a Linux box in for Hadia at her clinic and she has an employee that sits

465
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,260
down there.

466
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:07,720
She sits down there, uses it, literally did not even did not even say anything to her.

467
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,320
She just sits down and uses it.

468
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,240
She sees the icons on the side.

469
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,240
She could do the printing.

470
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,240
She can do the scanning.

471
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,240
She does it.

472
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,240
It's fine.

473
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,240
All the buttons are in the right place.

474
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,240
We've literally never had a conversation.

475
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,560
And then when I finally asked her, how's the computer working?

476
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,560
She's good.

477
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,640
She looks at me like I'm crazy.

478
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,640
It's fine.

479
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,640
Should I do something wrong with it?

480
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,640
Why are you asking?

481
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,640
Yeah.

482
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,640
You know what did not come out of her mouth?

483
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,120
Well, I really can't stand unity.

484
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,320
I really I wish it was known three Katie.

485
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,520
Yeah, that was not what came out of her mouth.

486
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,600
So we definitely live in a bubble when when it comes to these things just a little bit.

487
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,440
The original argument about the guy saying that it's there, it's an exit from it.

488
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,880
You could just say that it's a they're developing a convergence concept because they already

489
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,180
had a desktop environment built and they already had the server infrastructure built.

490
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:53,120
So in order to do the convergence, they needed to work on the mobile.

491
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,000
So now that they're getting closer and closer to the convergence, they can work less on

492
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,180
mobile and more on the other stuff.

493
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:02,080
So just make just changing slight direction doesn't mean that they're going to completely

494
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,080
abandon it.

495
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,080
Yeah, I think so.

496
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:10,760
Interesting, I think we would have talked last year about, you know, how we saw them

497
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,720
focusing on mobile and how we liked what they were doing on the desktop, but they wanted

498
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,000
to see more focus in that area.

499
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,520
So it's almost kind of like an old Intel tick tock kind of thing where, hey, now we're back

500
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,580
on the desktop.

501
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,880
Maybe that means, you know, if it's a bad thing for 2016, maybe it means there'll be

502
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,880
some good things in 2017 to be excited about, you know, and also, we've just watched so

503
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:34,200
many different vendors or hardware makers or whoever just lose their ass in mobile.

504
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,480
So it just doesn't look as awesome of a market as it used to.

505
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,200
So as a company, they're probably going, well, maybe we'll just let them eat each other.

506
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,760
We've got this cloud thing, desktop thing, enterprise thing.

507
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,440
So what do you think of Jack's next point then?

508
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,440
You ready for this one?

509
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,440
Let's hear it.

510
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,920
Yeah, so I think because, you know, we kind of were hard on that one.

511
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,320
So this one might be a little different.

512
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,120
Elementary OS will gain significant ground.

513
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,400
He says, I'm not trying to be partial here, but I believe partially due to Canonical's

514
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,560
failed foray into the phone space, Elementary OS will become a much bigger player by the

515
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,400
end of 2017.

516
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,400
There's a good reason for that.

517
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,880
Elementary OS has an amazing flavor of Linux.

518
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,000
It's very user friendly.

519
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,960
It's beautifully designed, and it makes working with Linux very easy.

520
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,760
He goes on also to say that Elementary OS currently stands at number five on DistroWatch

521
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,760
with the ranking.

522
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:26,600
And he says by the end of the year, he believes it will just be a bit number two under Mint.

523
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,600
It's interesting.

524
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,560
I just read another article today too that thinks that part of the reason they... People

525
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,740
were speculating about... Where did I see this?

526
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:38,040
People were speculating about what will take Linux to get to 5% desktop market share, and

527
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:45,480
one of the things in that speculation was that Elementary OS would play a significant

528
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,120
part in growth.

529
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,960
This is two people now saying Elementary OS is going to play a significant role in 2017

530
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,960
for growth.

531
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,480
I don't think just Elementary OS either.

532
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:02,280
I think Elementary OS are doing great things, and they are very squarely focused on the

533
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,600
Windows and Mac users who are looking to switch to Linux.

534
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:12,080
But I think the other two distributions that will also grow in popularity are going to

535
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:18,800
be Solus and KDE Neon, but specifically its LTS version that they've just announced.

536
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,800
Really?

537
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,800
You think that?

538
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,800
You think so?

539
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,800
Tell me more why.

540
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,960
Well, those three projects all have something in common.

541
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,360
They've all... Well, Elementary has been around for a long time, but it's really come

542
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,240
of age in this last release that they've put out.

543
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,400
It really felt like it was the whole thing.

544
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:44,600
But there's a lot of buzz around Solus and KDE Neon, and I think that people are tempted

545
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,640
to those to try them.

546
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,640
And I think what I've seen is a lot of Arch Linux users who are tired of curating their

547
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:58,220
own system moving to more cutting edge curated desktop operating systems.

548
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:04,600
So I think Elementary for those people that just want something that works and is stylish

549
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:12,720
and has got familiar workflows, and Solus and KDE Neon for the enthusiasts, probably

550
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:18,320
most of our audience, who are looking for something new and shiny that's got all the

551
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,240
bells and whistles.

552
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,880
That's interesting because Neon's been tugging at my distro hopping gene, or whatever it

553
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,500
is in me that makes me want to constantly move around.

554
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,360
It's tugging on that note again saying, hey, come over here to KDE Neon land.

555
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:40,120
X-Metal in the chat room says, well, what's the difference between Neon LTS and Kibuntu?

556
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,120
Where's the line there?

557
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,120
What do you think, Ron?

558
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:48,440
Oh, well, the biggest thing about the difference between Kibuntu and Neon is Kibuntu does the

559
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,920
six month thing with Ubuntu.

560
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,960
Neon is based only on the LTS 16.04.

561
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:02,080
So that's the biggest difference, but also the Plasma desktop updates in Neon the day

562
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,080
it releases.

563
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,520
Kibuntu is months behind, usually.

564
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:12,080
There was a post recently about how you can get the latest Plasma 5.8 in Ubuntu with

565
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,760
the Kibuntu backports.

566
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,840
If you had Neon, you'd already have it months ago.

567
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:24,200
The difference between the LTS of Neon, it's kind of weird that they use that term because

568
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,800
Neon LTS, they're both using Ubuntu LTS.

569
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:34,120
It's just that the Neon version is like Plasma 5.8 is the LTS of Plasma.

570
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:39,220
So Neon LTS is 5.8 Plasma on top of the LTS Ubuntu.

571
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:43,240
So if you use the regular Neon and not the LTS Neon, you're going to continue to get

572
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,360
updates to Plasma.

573
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,360
So like 5.9.

574
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,360
Right.

575
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,360
Right.

576
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,360
Right.

577
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,280
But in theory, if you have an LTS desktop environment, an LTS based distro, that could

578
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:55,420
be a pretty sweet setup for those that are looking for a powerful workstation that lasts

579
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,420
a long time.

580
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,240
And you wanted to add something to that discussion.

581
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,240
Go ahead.

582
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,720
I've heard that kicked around of which one, what's the difference between Kibuntu and

583
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,720
Neon?

584
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:11,200
Well, Kibuntu is Ubuntu's way of doing KDE and Neon is KDE's way of doing Ubuntu.

585
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,200
And it's much better.

586
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,280
No, because they're both separate.

587
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,960
They're both different community projects.

588
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,940
Canonical and Ubuntu does not work on Kibuntu.

589
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:26,920
So that's I mean, that's like Kibuntu is more of a full service distro.

590
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,760
It's got all the applications like ocular, PDF viewers and things like that.

591
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:35,400
And it's all built in for you and it's got like email clients and all this other stuff.

592
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:40,040
KDE Neon is just the fundamentals of what makes the distro work.

593
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,040
And that's it.

594
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,440
You add everything else yourself.

595
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,080
So it's more of a minimalistic with a rolling on top.

596
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:55,680
But there's the one thing I would say is that if you want if you want a KDE Ubuntu base

597
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,800
and you don't want to do all the effort of having to like set up things up, Kibuntu is

598
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,240
going to do it more for you.

599
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,320
OK, so it depends on like your preference.

600
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,360
I think what would be said about the enthusiast, Neon is definitely more for the enthusiasts

601
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,740
rather than just give it to me and let it go.

602
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:18,840
So Wimby, you say you notice a lot of buzz, I have to notice about about Neon, about Solus.

603
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,680
But of course, you're being humble and not mentioning Matei, but I see a lot of buzz

604
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,020
around that, too.

605
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,020
That's interesting.

606
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:31,280
So elementary OS, in my estimation, is probably going to be an important distribution.

607
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,100
Is it going to be a game changer distribution, though?

608
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,120
And something like what Wimby said, you know, they have been around a while and I feel like

609
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,960
they, you know, it's not that they're not moving, they're doing a lot of cool stuff.

610
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:44,400
It's just feels like it's a slower wave, a longer period, you know, that like it feels

611
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,880
like it was a long time since I was excited about their last release.

612
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,660
And now there's the newest release.

613
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,800
And I think there's a lot of good things.

614
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:54,160
But at least in our circles, maybe there's less because it changes slower.

615
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,880
There's less that we have to think about.

616
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,400
I think it's because they feel like they're it feels like they're playing catch up when

617
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,760
other DEs already have like everything you expect.

618
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,200
Like Pantheon for a for a long time, maybe even still, had had no ability to always on

619
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,160
top for a window, which seems like a fundamental in every other DE.

620
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:19,100
So like but when you when the reason why it's going to be very popular is because it's kind

621
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,240
of like a full cohesive unit of a system.

622
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,240
Right.

623
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,240
Right.

624
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,080
So I guess I wanted to double down on something that Wimpy said that Rotten seemed to jump

625
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:33,400
in on and it kind of made my head nod, too, was that Wimpy said, I think one of the targets

626
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:38,160
for Neon will be ARCH users who are sick of curating their own desktop.

627
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,160
And that hit me because I see that sometimes.

628
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,640
And Antigros definitely tries to serve that niche.

629
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,940
But I wonder if that might be a thing over 2017.

630
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:51,460
Will there be a as these other distributions stand up and get more popular and get more

631
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,960
software available to them and get more momentum?

632
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,080
Will there be a bit of a migration, do you think, Wes?

633
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,200
And like as as rolling becomes more than just the ARCH Gentoo crowd, right.

634
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,280
So it's like suddenly you have options.

635
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:05,260
If you before, it felt like it was more like, yes, you rolled and you put everything together

636
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,080
yourself and you got this great system.

637
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:11,000
But it could be there's an audience there that they want the new packages, they want

638
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,080
the fresh stuff, but they don't necessarily need to put it all together if someone else

639
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,080
is glued it in a good way.

640
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,040
You know, so let's talk about that for a second.

641
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:24,920
So rolling has has changed or not changed, but has seen it sort of become like the buzzword

642
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,080
in some cases for distributions like, yeah, we're going to go rolling, we're going to

643
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,080
go rolling.

644
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:33,520
We've seen some major refactorings, like on the case of OpenSUSE, you know, not this year,

645
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,860
but just recently.

646
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,280
And Fedora is now talking about that.

647
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:41,260
It definitely seems to have done something really good for SUSE because it feels like

648
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:45,040
in our audience, there's more people using it now than there used to be.

649
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,520
It still doesn't feel like one of the major big players that has a lot of the community

650
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,200
excited about it and hasn't taken over the enterprise.

651
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,520
But it feels like it's carving out this this group of users that use it that really like

652
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,520
it.

653
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,560
And that's a good sign that they got they're doing something right there and that they

654
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,000
could be on the precipice of tipping that over.

655
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,560
So that's been interesting to watch SUSE.

656
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:11,560
I wonder if I wonder if as we go through 2017, if we'll see that them across the door rumors.

657
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:19,160
And then, my friends, we have Microsoft, oh, oh, Microsoft, oh, Microsoft, you just you

658
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,520
never know what they're going to do anymore.

659
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,800
And Jack thinks they're going to open up Windows.

660
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,840
I wonder if he I wonder if he's bold enough.

661
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:30,920
Oh, man, I know I wonder if he's bold enough to predict the license.

662
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,840
This might sound crazy, he says, but for this Jack, man, I like you.

663
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,120
But this is almost making me want to throw out this whole list.

664
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,480
He says this might sound crazy, but I think it makes sense.

665
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,560
Microsoft stands to gain far more leverage by opening up the source for their Windows

666
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,560
platform.

667
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:47,280
Not only would this be a boon for the enterprise, it would also enable a lot of enterprise level

668
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,760
systems and services to better integrate with Windows.

669
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,760
Yeah, because that's well, he says I don't suspect suspect we'll actually see an open

670
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,060
source version of Windows release.

671
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:58,640
What I do believe is that Microsoft will finally become open to this idea and begin to see

672
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,280
a certain validity to handling over source to their platform specific entities.

673
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:08,080
I don't I don't follow that at all, even I don't even think they could because of IP

674
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,080
reasons.

675
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,080
Exactly.

676
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,080
This doesn't seem possible.

677
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,280
If you remember the whole open Solaris project and how long it took them to rewrite the parts

678
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,480
they needed to that were, you know, written by some contractor that they couldn't give

679
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,480
out because they didn't have permission.

680
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:23,000
I can't imagine Microsoft is any different with Windows.

681
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,220
Like I'm sure there's tons of the Windows core that they just didn't even write a permission

682
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,220
to use.

683
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,220
Yeah.

684
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:37,240
I think that the recent Microsoft partnership with Qualcomm will have more to do with Microsoft's

685
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:41,720
resurgence than opening up Windows.

686
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,680
So you familiar with this new new arrangement?

687
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,680
No, talk about it.

688
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,680
Please tell us.

689
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:52,960
So Microsoft and Qualcomm are partnering so that Qualcomm are going to provide chips for

690
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,800
Windows to run on ARM, but it's full blooded Windows desktop on ARM.

691
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,800
And also the ability to run Windows 32 bit Intel binaries.

692
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,280
I was going to say I have seen that platform.

693
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:09,760
So they're going to do x86 32 bit binary emulation on ARM chips.

694
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:18,240
Yeah, so that opens up the entire back catalogue of Windows software on this platform on mobile,

695
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:25,840
which could or could not be either phones, but more likely probably surface type devices.

696
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,040
There's no reason they're going to open up Windows to do that.

697
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:33,360
No, I can see them doing more open things in their cloud environments and that focus,

698
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,360
you know, new products being open.

699
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,880
But yeah, there's just no reason to go back and do that.

700
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,240
Historically, we can now look back over sort of, you know, 18 months, two years of Microsoft's

701
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:47,560
behaviour and it's about server and enabling technologies that they've open sourced.

702
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:51,120
It hasn't been core core products and it certainly hasn't been Windows.

703
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,120
Right.

704
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:58,800
So this is this has been my thought is if we watch Microsoft specifically now in 2017,

705
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:03,320
I don't I think them doing much more with Windows.

706
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,760
They're just going to do I think do business as usual with Windows as businesses need Windows

707
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,760
and people they're doing business want Windows.

708
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,640
It's just going to be what they've always done.

709
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:16,040
I think what we need to watch for is the new Microsoft hardware that comes out in 2017.

710
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,960
Their surface books, their home devices, the stuff that they're really kind of putting

711
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:23,720
a lot of their intention and energy behind.

712
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,000
How does that interact with Linux?

713
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,480
How locked down is that?

714
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,120
What is this built out of?

715
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,480
What what can I do with this if I don't want to run Windows?

716
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,560
Like what what are the answers to those questions?

717
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:38,040
And depending on how close it is to well, pretty much whatever you want or anything

718
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:42,840
that can use the API or well, if you just grab this, if the answer is getting closer

719
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,240
to that, then that shows you what Microsoft's real intent.

720
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:50,160
If the answer is, well, you need Windows 10 and it has to be activated, then that shows

721
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,480
you where their where their intentions at.

722
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,460
I would predict it's going to be the more open Microsoft.

723
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,460
It's going to be the more.

724
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,840
Oh, they don't really care what the OS is Microsoft.

725
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,720
And I feel like that's the direction they're going in.

726
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,520
And I would just expect more of that for to go as far as open sourcing Windows.

727
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,520
Right.

728
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:11,280
I think they're playing they're playing making a strong play towards developers, trying to

729
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,840
be friendly towards developers and not put up roadblocks.

730
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:17,520
And I don't think the Windows angle helps them with that in the same way as the open

731
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,000
cloud API stuff does.

732
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Yeah.

733
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,560
So we've just finished recording the last two episodes of Ubuntu podcast for the year

734
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,560
and also for season nine.

735
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,840
So we now take a break.

736
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:33,440
So if you're an Ubuntu podcast listener, we're we're off air for two or three months.

737
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,680
That sounds so nice.

738
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:41,720
And you want to you want to have a listen to what will be episode 44, which is our predictions

739
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:46,200
episode and what Poppy has to say about Microsoft in 2017.

740
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,800
So there's a tease for you.

741
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,400
I will definitely check that out.

742
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:55,480
I wonder if you have any thoughts on Chrome OS and Android merging in 2017 and if this

743
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,520
is going to be a problem for Linux desktop.

744
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,160
I don't I hate to be like chicken little.

745
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:05,260
But when I think about actual competition to Linux, I don't think about Mac OS or Windows.

746
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:08,200
Not long, long term, not really long term.

747
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:12,560
When I think of general desktop computing and business computing, people that are task

748
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:18,120
oriented that are that need this type of interface for the type of work they do, software development,

749
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:23,640
production, the all there's so many categories of work that will never really work on touch.

750
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,120
Maybe a lot of them always require local applications.

751
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:30,760
And I just I just really believe that one day these types of computers, these roles

752
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:37,420
will go towards a more general computing platform like Linux is always what I've hoped.

753
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:41,000
But I feel like it's very probably going to be Android.

754
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,640
Very likely because the industry is capable of wrapping its head around Android as a thing

755
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,180
that it can build towards.

756
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,840
They understand how to do product testing against it.

757
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:54,420
They understand how to image and flash gets put in every little place you can imagine.

758
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:58,540
And if they play ball, they get to take advantage of Google's APIs and services.

759
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:01,920
And that makes it nice for end users because they don't have to worry about shipping software

760
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,080
that actually is any good because they can just include Google stuff.

761
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,040
So and they can integrate with their Android of things.

762
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,040
Right.

763
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,040
Of course.

764
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,520
I really kind of wonder if they're targeting.

765
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,840
Are they really targeting the same audience, though?

766
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,480
I mean, Android is targeting your everyday, you know, person.

767
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:21,960
I don't see many guys that are their heart, their developers, their their, you know, web

768
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,960
designers, whatever.

769
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,480
I don't see those guys going over to Android.

770
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,880
And I think that's I think that's a large target audience that Linux could hit pretty

771
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,880
heavily.

772
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,660
If you can get the dev community, you can get the.

773
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,160
Those guys aren't using Chrome OS either.

774
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,160
Yeah.

775
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,160
I know.

776
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,160
That's what I'm saying.

777
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,160
No, I agree.

778
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,920
To be fair, I actually do it work and I use Chrome OS really regularly, but I'm mostly

779
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,120
just SSH ing into a real machine.

780
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,120
So right.

781
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:48,120
I was just going to say and you also have your company has built you tools that specifically

782
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:52,860
allow you to use Chrome OS, you know, as as as a method of production.

783
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,360
Most people would not have those resources available.

784
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,360
That's correct.

785
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,480
That could just become a thing, though.

786
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,480
But that could absolutely become a thing.

787
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,480
Yeah, right.

788
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,880
Like Chrome OS is actually really usable because I'm mostly as a staging through it.

789
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,640
And I have a couple of web portals I use in the mail client, the browser and all that

790
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,640
stuff.

791
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,640
Yeah, I can see that unreasonable for a modern company, especially if you use exchange.

792
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:13,120
You get Office 365 potentially, and that satisfies all your browser needs.

793
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:16,200
Or you use the Google apps for business or use Google apps for business.

794
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,080
Those two things are so popular now.

795
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:22,320
Yeah, it seems fairly possible that if your other work can be ported somehow, whatever

796
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:27,400
it is, you basically just describe the entire computing setup for my kids school.

797
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,400
That's how they do it.

798
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,400
Oh, no, that's not surprising at all.

799
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,200
That would actually be the most poignant case to make is for school.

800
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,360
It's really easy to go with a Chromebook these days.

801
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,400
And that's what schools are going for because they're cheap.

802
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,360
That's what they have done.

803
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,040
Every kid in Dylan's second grade class gets a Chromebook.

804
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,040
Oh, hey.

805
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,040
The teachers are on Chromebooks.

806
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,320
They're on Google apps for business.

807
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,980
It's the whole shebang.

808
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,440
And it's not just his class.

809
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,640
That's how it is for the students there.

810
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,640
And I don't know.

811
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,520
I don't know who's getting that big fat check.

812
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,520
Somebody got a big fat check.

813
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,520
Yeah, definitely.

814
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,520
Wow.

815
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,960
So I could just I just to me this seems like this is going to spread.

816
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,880
They can jump in real quick.

817
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,880
It's free.

818
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,740
I was actually just working with a client and Google actually you can work on a deal

819
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,740
with Google.

820
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:15,080
They will give you access to the console and Google apps for G Suite.

821
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,260
G Suite is what they're calling it.

822
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,080
But they give it to you for free if you're a school or education institute.

823
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:27,320
Yeah, you need to be very careful about your definition of free here, because free is basically

824
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:32,240
hooking a generation of children into the Google ecosystem.

825
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,240
That becomes the new normal.

826
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,080
That becomes what you expect to do.

827
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,320
You thought it was bad when they were given a Macs.

828
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,560
I mean, yeah.

829
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,420
Or Windows computers and you're bringing them up on a closed source operating system.

830
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:49,160
Now you're bringing them up into, you know, a whole online life.

831
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,240
A privatized spine apparatus.

832
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,280
Yeah, it's just it's just worrying.

833
00:38:54,280 --> 00:39:02,880
But that aside, you know, Chrome Android blended together for, you know, casual desktop use

834
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:10,500
or maybe most, you know, office based jobs is very compelling.

835
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:15,720
But like you say, for developer stuff, maybe not so much.

836
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:22,120
And also Android have just announced their IoT thing, which is kind of just Android at

837
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,120
the moment.

838
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:28,480
They haven't seemed to announce anything specifically to target it at IoT.

839
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:34,040
But because of the juggernaut of Android, you can see that that's going to sort of probably

840
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:41,240
pick up some traction over the over the coming year.

841
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:48,360
And it'll be interesting to see how people decide to build their IoT devices and platforms

842
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:54,800
in the backdrop of 2016, which frankly has been a miserable year for IoT in terms of

843
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:00,560
appalling security and carefree attitude by device manufacturers.

844
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:08,400
I just want to quickly address kind of what, you know, I agree that there is definitely

845
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,000
some concern and I definitely think that there is that we are paying a price, you know, for

846
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
the Google infrastructure.

847
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,240
But I got to tell you, Wimpy, I mean, I sat on the other end of a conference call with

848
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,680
three adults that had no idea what they were going to do for this infrastructure problem

849
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,400
because they didn't have the budget, they didn't have the resources, they didn't have

850
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,400
the money.

851
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,680
And when we got a hold of Google and they said, hey, we'll just give you everything

852
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,680
for free.

853
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,800
We'll give you the we'll give you the way to manage the devices and we'll give you email

854
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,400
and we'll give you the software.

855
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,080
Everything when you get all of that.

856
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:41,320
And then on top of that, on top of that, you have to understand when these kids leave the

857
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:45,160
education institute, they are not tied to it.

858
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,640
It's not like all of a sudden, like with what Microsoft is doing with their office suite,

859
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,240
after you left the student and teacher version for one hundred and forty dollars, you wanted

860
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,920
to write a resume, then they ding those students because they didn't have the professional

861
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,240
version for five hundred dollars.

862
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,360
It's not it's not like that.

863
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:01,280
I mean, those students can go create a regular Google account and have access to all of those

864
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,280
same tools.

865
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,280
So, yeah.

866
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,280
Is it in Google's best interest?

867
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,280
Of course.

868
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,680
Is Google taking that information and making money off of it while they say they're not?

869
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,240
But they probably are.

870
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,520
And there is so there is a cost there that's being paid.

871
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:17,000
But I would think that I would say the real cost is that there's a huge benefit.

872
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I agree.

873
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,200
There's a huge benefit to put computing in the hands of young children and enable students

874
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,340
to have access to technology that didn't have it before.

875
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:28,560
And I don't think that it is too expensive of a cost.

876
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,680
I think that is probably the better good overall, especially if a certain percentage of them

877
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,760
become intellectually curious about how it works.

878
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:40,960
But the thing that does make me concerned is it's essentially the death of desktop software.

879
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,920
What student is going to come up on Google Docs on Google Docs and ever, ever once they

880
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:51,240
go start a business or they go into school, install LibreOffice and use that?

881
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,200
That is never going to happen.

882
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:58,360
It is it is guaranteed lock into the Google ecosystem because it'll simply be how they

883
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:03,360
expect things to work, how they share information using their social network attached to Google.

884
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:07,520
The way Google Docs works with links and all that you just you will become to depend on

885
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:12,080
that infrastructure and those expectations and LibreOffice will never have a shot.

886
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:18,980
In much the same way that Microsoft encouraged students to use Windows products from an early

887
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:23,720
age throughout their education, all around the world.

888
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:27,360
And people consequently know that as the de facto standard.

889
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:32,760
And if you're not studying computer science or software engineering, it's unlikely that

890
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:38,260
you will ever consider that there is anything else out there available, although most mostly

891
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:41,920
because of iPhone and iPod, they're aware that Mac exists.

892
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,920
So what do you think?

893
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:49,960
Be careful what you wish for to two lines from a popular children's novel, eat me, drink

894
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,880
me.

895
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,120
I still think that Windows is so ingrained in the business world before kids get out

896
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,320
of school using it.

897
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,200
Maybe there may be more similar cycle.

898
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,880
It was only what, like 15, 20 years of a life cycle of that stuff.

899
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,880
I don't know.

900
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,880
Microsoft, I don't know.

901
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,120
You know, because it's getting chewed away at both ends because Microsoft themselves

902
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,600
isn't exactly pushing Windows platforms too hard.

903
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,580
They're moving people over to Azure and Office 365 on their end.

904
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:18,440
So it's kind of getting chewed out from both ends.

905
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:21,480
I just don't think any of these things last long enough that it's really ever a lock-in

906
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,560
because they end up kind of fading and dying and things change.

907
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,280
And that is good for us running Linux, right?

908
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,280
Yeah.

909
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,280
I mean, on the flip side.

910
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,000
Not the native apps, but at least the base OS.

911
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,320
The platform agnostic aspect that comes as a result of it is good for Linux.

912
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:38,520
But that might not make Stolman very happy.

913
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,520
Not much does.

914
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,440
And the value of this is negative.

915
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:45,460
So we're going to switch over to Ask Noah in a bit.

916
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:48,480
So I probably, before we wrap up, should give you guys a heads up.

917
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,880
I'll plug the phone number right now if you want to call in.

918
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,080
And if you want to talk business, you want to talk Linux with Mr. Noah.

919
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:58,640
One eight eight three four seven zero zero one one.

920
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,800
One eight eight three four seven zero zero one one.

921
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,520
If you're watching live right now, the last unplugged of the year, at least the last live

922
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,240
one.

923
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:10,560
And then next Tuesday is the Beard Spectacular Clip Show.

924
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,240
But if you want to call in right now, if you're watching live, if you got a question for Mr.

925
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,240
Noah, do it.

926
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,240
And you should.

927
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,680
One eight eight three four seven zero zero one one.

928
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:19,680
OK.

929
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,680
So there's one more thing.

930
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,340
And this was sort of the worst of 2016.

931
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:27,800
So I'm going to get to my what I think was the worst thing in Linux for 2016.

932
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,560
And it was the vulnerabilities.

933
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:30,560
Because we were.

934
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,560
Oh yeah.

935
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,560
Sorry.

936
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,560
Not only were we not hit with.

937
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,560
I'm sorry.

938
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,200
How should I say this?

939
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,440
Not only did we have a fair amount of vulnerabilities, right?

940
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,440
Fair statement.

941
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:44,180
But they were like super embarrassing, had been around a really long time and really

942
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:49,400
hollowed out the argument that thousands of eyes make all bugs shallow.

943
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,880
It really like we took a blow to one of our biggest mantras this year.

944
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,120
And we had dirty cow.

945
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:58,560
We had we had shell shock and we had just I think all the botnets, right?

946
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,560
They're all made of Linux.

947
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,560
Yeah.

948
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:04,560
I was just I was gonna say I think we also had what was the was that LibreVault or not

949
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,560
LibreVault?

950
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,560
I can't remember.

951
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,560
So I was was that this year?

952
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,840
I can't remember if the heart bleed if it was heart bleed this year.

953
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,840
Yeah.

954
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:11,840
I can't call.

955
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,840
It was 2014, man.

956
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:13,840
Okay.

957
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,840
All right.

958
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:15,840
It's almost been three years.

959
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,840
It feels like it feels like we had that's that's the reason.

960
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:17,840
Okay.

961
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,800
This is why because it feels like we had three or four heart bleeds this year.

962
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,760
Like one year we had heart bleed and that was like, God, that was a bad one.

963
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:23,760
And we all remember it.

964
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,480
But it feels like this year we had like three of them.

965
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,480
And it feels like we're on that we're that bad part of the slope where like we're finding

966
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,760
a lot of these things, but they're we're getting them fixed.

967
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,880
And it's just it's we're so big now.

968
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,480
I'll tell you what the worst thing is.

969
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,480
I mean, it's good.

970
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,680
And I'm very thankful for it.

971
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:42,360
But the worst thing is, you know, why all of these vulnerabilities are being found because

972
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:48,320
either somebody is exploiting them or because a huge company that makes a ton of money off

973
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:54,360
commercial software or stealing people's information and making ad money is doing projects because

974
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,600
they have so much extra cash sitting around.

975
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:00,880
They have a project to better their own interest in this field and are researching these look

976
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:06,560
at like Google's Project Zero, Cisco's others, others have things just like this that only

977
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:12,680
they could sustain because they make so much money that they can fund these things.

978
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:16,600
It's not the millions of free software developers all around the world.

979
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:20,200
Now hopefully some of these companies have snatched up some of the best software developers

980
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,280
and that's they just happen to be there.

981
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:26,980
But that's the other thing I don't really I really kind of wish we hadn't hit that so

982
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:32,040
hard this year and I really kind of wish that we that it would have been more from the community

983
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:36,240
would have I would have loved to have been like independent hacker groups on the Internet

984
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:41,140
that have self-organized as a community and are doing this and solving these problems

985
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:45,480
and have a name for themselves and are not Project Zero from Google.

986
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,880
It's like just a group of real people that are just out there.

987
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:49,880
I don't know.

988
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,960
The community making itself better rather than something that feels kind of like outsiders,

989
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,360
even if those people do heavily use open source themselves.

990
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:58,880
And I'm always very thankful that these companies have these projects and it's like, OK, great.

991
00:46:58,880 --> 00:46:59,880
We found another one.

992
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,160
At the same time, I'm like, I wish we could have caught it ourselves.

993
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:06,240
Boy, it sure is stressing the no press is bad press, right?

994
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,600
Yeah, just kind of not what the open source developers necessarily want to do.

995
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,600
Right.

996
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:13,320
Like these people who exist to find these vulnerabilities who love doing this are going

997
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,960
to try to get paid to do it.

998
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,640
And so they're going to join, you know, Project Zero and whatnot.

999
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:21,820
So if you try if you're going to try to call Talos or whoever they call it, if you're going

1000
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:27,160
to try to call Noah, it's one eight seven seven.

1001
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,160
Not eight eight.

1002
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,160
I don't know why he said eight eight.

1003
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,120
Noah, what the hell, man?

1004
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,120
What the hell?

1005
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,120
Are you in there?

1006
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,120
Are you still in there, Noah?

1007
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,360
This guy was about to ask about this.

1008
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,360
Look at this.

1009
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,360
What does it say?

1010
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,360
Can you read that on my screen?

1011
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,360
What's that first telegram say?

1012
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,360
What was that first?

1013
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,360
It says eight seven seven.

1014
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,360
Uh huh.

1015
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,360
Well, OK.

1016
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,360
Now, are you going to make me take a screenshot?

1017
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,360
Really?

1018
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,360
See, look.

1019
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,360
What does that first number say, Wes?

1020
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,440
What does it say?

1021
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,440
That's all eights.

1022
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,440
That's all eights, baby.

1023
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,440
That's all eights.

1024
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,440
That's all eights.

1025
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,440
That's all eights.

1026
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,440
And then he sends me a correction.

1027
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,440
Hey, jerk.

1028
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,440
Hey, jerk.

1029
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:00,160
It's eight seven seven three four seven zero zero one one.

1030
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,160
Eight seven seven.

1031
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,160
We need an API call to return this.

1032
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,800
Three four seven zero zero one one.

1033
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,240
That I just can't even with this guy.

1034
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,080
I can't even with this guy right now.

1035
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,080
We don't know.

1036
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,560
But we're going to find out today on Ask Noah.

1037
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:12,840
I said just take Skype calls.

1038
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:13,840
That's what I said.

1039
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,080
I just take Skype calls.

1040
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,400
That's that's all.

1041
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,560
The other thing that I think did kind of start to develop this year is Apple did kind of

1042
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:24,080
have a rough year for the desktops and laptops and enthusiasts, the same people we're just

1043
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:31,960
kind of talking about in some regard are actually there is an uptick.

1044
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:36,280
I think the switch is real based on the feedback we've been getting on Koda radio from Mike

1045
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,280
switch.

1046
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,400
I feel like people have been following along with him because they're doing it, too.

1047
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,400
And they're coming from Max.

1048
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,920
And I think that's that's that's been a bigger trend this year than we expected.

1049
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:45,920
Oh, definitely.

1050
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,840
I mean, I don't I don't think we expected Apple the alienation to be that real.

1051
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:51,840
Right.

1052
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:52,840
Like there's always going to be some people switching.

1053
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,120
There's like that small little right little flow of people.

1054
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:58,720
But I have a lot of people who just there was not the computer that they wanted.

1055
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,480
They were really, you know, obviously they had been waiting a long time to buy a new

1056
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,440
Apple computer.

1057
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:09,460
It was it was it was an event that I guess what I expected was I expected a slow burn

1058
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:13,580
of boredom and dissatisfaction with a platform that wasn't really serving their needs anymore

1059
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:14,580
or being innovated.

1060
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:18,480
And what Apple did was they dropped this huge doubt bomb.

1061
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,960
This this massive doubt bomb that said to the hardcore enthusiasts, I'm not sure there's

1062
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,320
actually going to be any better Max.

1063
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,140
In fact, this is a Mark Gurman.

1064
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:33,880
For those of you that don't follow Apple News, Mark Gurman is probably the guy that has the

1065
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:38,000
best Apple sources in the tech press.

1066
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,040
Mark Gurman is he's he helped start a nine to five Mac.

1067
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:47,120
And then because his sourcing became so good, he was able to build a name for himself.

1068
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,480
He's been hired by Bloomberg.

1069
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,560
And now he writes for Bloomberg, who is trying to focus even more on technology because it's

1070
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,480
a huge part of the stock market.

1071
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,860
And that's why Bloomberg cares.

1072
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,680
So now Mark Gurman writes for Bloomberg.

1073
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:03,440
And today he wrote to to diehard fans, Apple's Macintosh sometimes seems like an afterthought

1074
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,440
these days.

1075
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:09,560
Mac upgrades once frequent frequent ritual are few and far between the Mac Pro.

1076
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:15,940
The Apple's marquee computer hasn't been refreshed since 2013.

1077
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:16,940
That's embarrassing.

1078
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:18,400
Yeah, it is embarrassing.

1079
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,440
The affordable and flexible Mac Mini was last upgraded in 2014.

1080
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,200
And the new machine when the me and when a new machine does roll out, the results are

1081
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:31,200
sometimes underwhelming, if not infuriating to the devotees.

1082
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,680
So he says that he's been interviewing people familiar with Apple's inner workings, and

1083
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:40,640
reveals that the Mac is getting far and far less attention than it once did.

1084
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:46,680
Confirming all these diversities, Gurman sources that the Mac team has lost clout within the

1085
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:51,160
famed industrial design group led by Johnny Ive and the company software team.

1086
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:55,160
They also describe a lack of clear direction from senior management, departures of key

1087
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:59,360
people working on Mac Mac hardware and technical challenges that have delayed the rollout of

1088
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:03,360
new computers.

1089
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:08,180
So there is a real actual lack of focus on the Mac in Apple.

1090
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:09,180
It's true.

1091
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:13,520
The Mac is actually dying in Apple.

1092
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:18,160
Now Tim Cook, they leaked a for an internal forum posting saying they have some great

1093
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,520
desktops in the line.

1094
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,520
But who knows?

1095
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,960
To them, the Mac, the new MacBook Pro is a great machine.

1096
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:24,960
They say it all the time.

1097
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,040
It's a great new machine.

1098
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,280
So their definition is great.

1099
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,280
It varies.

1100
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:34,360
And the Mac generates about 10 percent of Apple sales, which is legitimately big.

1101
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,360
That's billions.

1102
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36,940
So it's bigger than some companies make.

1103
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:40,000
But yeah, that is not good.

1104
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,520
That is not good for the for those that are out there hoping to make their living on a

1105
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,520
Mac.

1106
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:50,980
I wonder how much this window, the bash on Windows 10 will play into that.

1107
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:55,180
You know, the divergence that we see come into Linux users versus how many developers

1108
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:59,720
will be more happy to stick with Windows if they can get a real Unix shell going.

1109
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:00,720
Yeah.

1110
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,720
This is this could be good for Linux, too.

1111
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,720
Go ahead.

1112
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:04,720
It could be.

1113
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,180
I was saying that I think the Windows people, the people who would stay on Windows because

1114
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:11,600
of the access to Linux are the people who are are you OK with Windows in the first place?

1115
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:15,440
I don't think they're going to leave to go to Mac and instead of going to Mac because

1116
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:20,160
of the new releases of the out of touch bar, they could go to Linux instead.

1117
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,360
Here's here's actually what I'm thinking.

1118
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:29,320
I think a lot of high end technical users that switch to Mac did it as a refuge from

1119
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,440
Windows.

1120
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:34,480
I think a lot of them were pissed off at Windows at the time and they wanted something else.

1121
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,260
And the thing is, is Windows 10 is not good enough.

1122
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:42,540
It is especially if you want like if you have any standards, if you want to have high DPI,

1123
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:46,620
if you want to have consistent interface, if you want normal power management settings,

1124
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:51,900
if you have any like sort of like particular esoteric, you know, hipster standards that

1125
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:56,280
a lot of people like to make fun of as as quaint and not necessary, but things that

1126
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,400
people pay attention to stuff notice.

1127
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,960
If you are a person that is it pays attention to detail, Windows 10 is infuriating to use.

1128
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:07,760
I mean, it's just it is just an absolute train wreck of a mismatch of UI and a lack of high

1129
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,940
DPI support and old routing and typical Windows.

1130
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:16,440
It is everything Windows always has been with some nice stuff on top.

1131
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:20,440
So it's not going to attract Mac users.

1132
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:23,820
They're going to look at Linux.

1133
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:28,640
It's just it's I just I think maybe the reason I feel the most fired up about this because

1134
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,760
I've gotten the most emails about this.

1135
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,280
We've had people following this.

1136
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:37,220
There's podcasters I listen to that are making a transition right now because it was recommended

1137
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:39,320
to me by audience members like, hey, listen to this guy.

1138
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:40,520
He's doing the same thing.

1139
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:43,000
And it's this person has never heard of the Linux action show.

1140
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,080
He doesn't know who I am.

1141
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:48,120
And he is going through a process of switching from a Mac to Linux because he didn't want

1142
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,400
to go back to Windows.

1143
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:54,340
And it's it's I tell it is I get enough input now that I feel like this is a thing that

1144
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:57,960
is happening, not saying it's billions of people, but I'm saying it's a category of

1145
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:58,960
users now.

1146
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,720
And I love it.

1147
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:01,720
I love it.

1148
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:02,720
It's funny, too.

1149
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:06,540
You kind of see this like like they knew they always knew they could they could do Linux,

1150
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:07,540
you know, but they just didn't.

1151
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:10,000
It wasn't they knew it didn't have the polish they wanted or they didn't think it had the

1152
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
polish they wanted.

1153
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,200
And so now there's this like, well, I'm forced to look and oh, hey, it's really not as bad

1154
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,120
or it's better than I thought elementary exists.

1155
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:20,240
You know, you're starting to watch you starting to watch some of the cracks in Mac OS.

1156
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,440
You know, the new battery life on the MacBook Pro sucks.

1157
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:25,800
And of course, one of the ways Apple fixes it is they just remove the time estimate from

1158
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,880
the battery menu on Mac OS now.

1159
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,920
You're starting to see the cracks.

1160
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:34,360
And so it's like, well, yeah, OK, Linux has some problems, but so does Windows and so

1161
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,840
does Mac OS.

1162
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:39,360
So which which ones do I want to work with this time?

1163
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,360
And then you know, the grass is always greener.

1164
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,360
It's right.

1165
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:43,360
Oh, yeah.

1166
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,140
So, W.W., you were you were just saying that you knew somebody who made the switch because

1167
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:47,480
of Windows 10 to a Mac.

1168
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:48,480
What happened?

1169
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:56,920
Well, it's actually a family member of mine because all all PCs come with a 5400 RPM drive

1170
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:04,080
and that's what's causing part of it because Windows 10 is so heavy that you're sending

1171
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:11,640
people laptops with a 5400 RPM drive in like 2016 when you should be sending them out with

1172
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:18,120
SSDs and people are having such a poor experience, or at least the people I know, that they rather

1173
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:24,840
go to a Mac, pay the extra money, not have the hassle of the average user and having

1174
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:28,800
to put up with Windows stuff and just have a smooth experience.

1175
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:32,680
They're willing to pay for that smooth experience that they get with Mac.

1176
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:38,680
Now, mind you, they're not the most technical person, but they just want a good UI, stuff

1177
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:44,480
that works and, you know, maybe they'll spend more because of it.

1178
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,480
I like that theory.

1179
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:51,680
I think I'm going to just sort of sit back and just sort of keep watching Mike and watch

1180
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:52,680
others.

1181
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:53,680
Mike's also considering doing it now.

1182
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:54,680
He's been doing it on Linux.

1183
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:57,920
He's considering doing a stint on Windows and see if he can get Bash on Windows to work

1184
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,760
for him and do that just to give it a fair shake, too.

1185
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,640
Yeah, no, that would be actually quite interesting.

1186
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:06,920
You know, I'm not going to do it, but it feels like it's worth looking into.

1187
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:14,760
I did want to just sort of conjecture about one other category that I'm getting sort of

1188
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:18,280
my opinions beginning to change from this is a toy to maybe this is something that's

1189
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:24,520
worth taking seriously, and it's not Linux-related specifically, though I do hope open source

1190
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:28,440
and Linux and the entire ecosystem isn't locked out from this next category in 2017, and I

1191
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:32,400
think it's going to be a tight line.

1192
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:36,760
I really think Amazon's nailed something with the Alexa.

1193
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:40,680
I thought, so I do something with the news is I notice when a new product comes out,

1194
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:41,680
there's a hype cycle.

1195
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:42,680
Oh, yeah.

1196
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:43,880
You know, it starts before the product comes out.

1197
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:44,880
It starts.

1198
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:45,880
Then there's the announcement.

1199
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:46,880
Then there's hype till the release.

1200
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:47,880
Then there's release.

1201
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:52,640
Then there's selective review hype where certain people release the reviews.

1202
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,540
Then there's the limited release to the public where you start to actually get the people

1203
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:59,280
that are using it begin to review and comment on it, and then there's folks like me who

1204
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:03,360
like to use it for a while and then give you a review, so those start to pop up for a while,

1205
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:06,720
and then it just sort of drops down, and there's not a lot of people that usually keep talking

1206
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,160
about a product after that if it's not successful.

1207
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:12,320
We don't get exact numbers from Amazon, but we know they just kind of churn them out as

1208
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:13,320
they can.

1209
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:17,920
Well, one of the things that I find to be really fascinating when it comes to the Alexa

1210
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:22,720
is there is still a good flow of posts about people talking about things you can do with

1211
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:28,560
it, ways you can integrate it, what an interesting device it is, how reliable it is.

1212
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:32,560
Those things are still being written on a daily basis about the Alexa right now, and

1213
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:35,320
Google's obviously interested in this area.

1214
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:39,000
Microsoft's interested in this area, who knows about Apple, but they've got Siri on the devices.

1215
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:45,160
I wonder if in 2017 if we will be able to be somewhat of a player in this field.

1216
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:50,960
I'm not really even talking Mycroft, I mean just our stuff isn't off on its own island.

1217
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,040
We're not completely left out.

1218
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:56,320
We're not completely excluded from playing.

1219
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,520
I wonder where this is going to go, and what do you think, Wes?

1220
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:01,240
When I look at things like the Alexa, it seems to be more open.

1221
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,680
It seems to be the more successful device.

1222
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,400
So I guess I'd say, what do you mean by we, when you ask that question?

1223
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,760
Well, when I'm using things like... Well, I like to use Telegram instead of WhatsApp.

1224
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:16,080
I like to use this podcast player instead of... What's the one, the streaming one that

1225
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,440
combines all the shows and makes it sound worse?

1226
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:22,400
It's the really popular podcast player that I should know off the top of my head.

1227
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,760
I should too, but I don't know.

1228
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:24,840
It's a podcast... Oh, damn it.

1229
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:29,680
It's like it basically makes... Anyways, there is software, there are radio and streaming

1230
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,360
services that just work with Alexa.

1231
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:32,360
Work with Alexa, right.

1232
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:38,160
There's stuff that when you're in their ecosystems, you work, but... I guess what I'm talking

1233
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,280
about, the things I choose to use.

1234
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,520
I choose to use Telegram instead of WhatsApp, or I choose to use...

1235
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:45,320
If you've made niche decisions about the products, maybe they're more open source friendly.

1236
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:47,920
Maybe they're more... Whatever, but they're not the... Yeah.

1237
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:51,280
Or maybe I have my calendar on own cloud instead of Google Calendar, or Nextcloud.

1238
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,900
It really does come down to how well do these things play with different APIs.

1239
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:55,900
Is there interop?

1240
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:56,900
Is that the focus?

1241
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,880
Because if it is just the three big... And you see that with a lot of things where it's

1242
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:05,280
like, hey, we integrate with your favorite clouds, that means you have Dropbox and iCloud,

1243
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,280
and that's it.

1244
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:11,200
But if it's like, hey, you can add whatever here, add your custom drop in a URL for your

1245
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,840
calendar files, and here you go, that's a whole different story.

1246
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:17,280
Have you thought about picking up on Alexa?

1247
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,340
Or a Google Home?

1248
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:20,180
The Google Home looked a little more interesting.

1249
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:22,320
When Alexa first came out, it was interesting.

1250
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:25,800
I'm very interested in their... It seems like they've done a lot of good work with

1251
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:29,480
the microphones, with actually making it so that it can hear you and process your voice

1252
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:31,240
well, which is interesting.

1253
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:32,240
And I did notice-

1254
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:33,240
Slash creepy.

1255
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:34,240
Slash creepy.

1256
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:38,040
It did also seem that, at least with Alexa, they've kind of... And maybe because it was

1257
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:43,520
from Amazon, who... I think on Coder you were talking about, it's kind of like the

1258
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,520
big four.

1259
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,740
They kind of get grouped in differently now.

1260
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:47,740
So maybe it was a little more friendly.

1261
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:51,080
But it seemed a lot of people who do value open source or free software had been playing

1262
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:52,180
with the Alexa in a way.

1263
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:56,040
So it does seem like it has some developer mindshare in that respect that maybe other

1264
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:57,040
devices don't.

1265
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,640
That's a good way... I think that's what I was trying to say, is the developer mindshare

1266
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:00,640
aspect of it.

1267
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:01,640
Yeah, that's a good way to put it.

1268
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,880
I don't suppose... I'm going to roll the dice.

1269
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:06,040
I don't know why I'm betting no for some reason.

1270
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:09,000
It's not that I think that you guys are all a bunch of haters, but I just... I'm going

1271
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:15,480
to guess... Does anybody in the Mamba Room have an Alexa or a Google Home?

1272
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,480
Nope.

1273
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,480
No.

1274
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,480
Yeah.

1275
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,480
Anybody considering getting one?

1276
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:22,480
No.

1277
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,480
Maybe.

1278
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:24,480
Oh, okay.

1279
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,080
So there is a wide range.

1280
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,040
So Wimpy, did you jump in on the IM?

1281
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,040
Yeah.

1282
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,320
Oh, all right.

1283
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,160
Tell me about this.

1284
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:35,320
I'm tempted to get an Amazon Echo.

1285
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:36,320
So am I.

1286
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:38,720
Why are you?

1287
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:44,600
Because friends of mine that have experimented with it and reading that I've done on the

1288
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:51,820
API, I can see how I can integrate it into projects that I'm working on trivially, more

1289
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:59,520
trivially than the other systems out there of a similar nature.

1290
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:05,000
I've been thinking about getting it because there are four... I'm sorry.

1291
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
No.

1292
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:13,600
There are one, two, three, four, five, six lights in the studio that are Hughes lights

1293
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,680
that are used now in production.

1294
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:20,080
And also there's certain timer aspects that could be really handy and certain other functions

1295
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:24,720
like J-Bot functions that could be really cool with Alexa.

1296
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:28,120
So I was thinking about maybe not necessarily for my house or my RV.

1297
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:29,120
But for the studio.

1298
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,120
For the studs.

1299
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,120
Hey, that could be fun.

1300
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,120
Yeah.

1301
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,120
What about... Now, Rod and I hear you jump in.

1302
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:34,120
So you were thinking about it too?

1303
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:35,120
Yeah.

1304
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,120
I'm thinking about it as well.

1305
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,780
Mainly because they have the multi-tier options.

1306
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:42,080
So it's not just like one device that you purchase that's $100 or something.

1307
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:43,560
The default Echo is $150.

1308
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:44,560
Oh.

1309
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:47,760
So then if you found it useful, you could slip it in in other places for cheaper.

1310
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:48,760
Yeah.

1311
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:52,840
The Echo Dot, they also have the Echo, the Tap, and the Echo Dot.

1312
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:59,160
The Echo is like $150, the Tap is like $90, and the Dot is only like $50 or $40 depending

1313
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:00,560
on if it's a discount or not.

1314
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:01,560
Like right now it's only $40.

1315
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:02,560
Yeah.

1316
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:06,080
You could get them in a three pack on special offer right now.

1317
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,080
Oh.

1318
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:08,080
What?

1319
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:09,080
The deal.

1320
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:10,080
What?

1321
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:11,080
Oh no.

1322
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:14,880
Oh, you know, Chris hasn't gotten a Christmas present for himself.

1323
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:15,880
Oh.

1324
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:16,880
You deserve it.

1325
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:17,880
You've been a good boy.

1326
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:21,520
Now, does anybody know, will the devices work together?

1327
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:25,520
Can I set a reminder, say, at home and then show up at the office and have the Echo at

1328
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,960
the office help me?

1329
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:28,960
Anybody know?

1330
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:29,960
Yeah.

1331
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:34,160
See, I think it's time I do need to figure these things out.

1332
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,160
Yeah.

1333
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:36,160
I hate not knowing.

1334
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,160
That would be a good point.

1335
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,160
Well, so anyways, I think that's going to be an interesting category.

1336
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,160
I know there is integration.

1337
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:44,400
I saw a video explaining that the integration exists, but I don't know in different locations

1338
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,400
how well it works.

1339
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:47,400
Fascinating.

1340
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:50,440
So I think this is going to be, I think it's going to be a really interesting category.

1341
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:54,800
And the thing is, I don't think all of the big players that are going to get in have

1342
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,040
gotten in yet.

1343
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:58,840
I think there's still going to be some interesting entries.

1344
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:00,720
So check it out.

1345
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:01,720
Check it out.

1346
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:04,680
It's, we'll have the links to the Echo in the show notes and the DOT if you guys are

1347
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:05,680
curious.

1348
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:09,080
And if you have one, let me know, let me know how that works.

1349
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:12,160
There's another thing that you might want people who are like paranoid about and always

1350
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:13,160
listening.

1351
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:15,400
The tap version doesn't listen to you until you hit the button.

1352
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,400
Right.

1353
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,400
The DOT is 90 bucks.

1354
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:22,120
The DOT is 40 bucks and the big Echo is 140 bucks.

1355
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:25,460
So the DOT and I don't think the DOT is not always listening either, right?

1356
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:26,460
The DOT is.

1357
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:27,460
Yeah.

1358
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:28,460
Oh, it is?

1359
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:29,460
Yeah.

1360
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:31,560
You're telling me the DOT does everything the big Echo does.

1361
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:33,200
It's just not a huge speaker.

1362
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,200
Yeah.

1363
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:37,480
It doesn't have as big speaker and it doesn't have as like the microphone.

1364
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,920
That seems obvious then that seems like that for 40 bucks, that's an obvious way to try

1365
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:41,920
it out.

1366
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:42,920
Try it out.

1367
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:43,920
Yeah.

1368
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:44,920
See that starts tempting me too.

1369
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:45,920
Like I don't need it in my life.

1370
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:46,920
I don't need those things.

1371
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:47,920
But for 40 bucks, I can-

1372
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:48,920
It seems like a lot of fun to do it.

1373
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:49,920
The category is interesting enough.

1374
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,320
No, it's better because it has the aux out and everything so you can hook it up to like

1375
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:53,600
a decent speaker system.

1376
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:54,600
No.

1377
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:55,600
That's great.

1378
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,600
Yeah.

1379
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:57,600
That's the draw to the ones that don't have the speakers is they can be hooked up.

1380
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,600
That's pretty clever.

1381
01:03:58,600 --> 01:03:59,600
Yeah.

1382
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:02,800
Actually, if you go look on Amazon, go look at the advertising material, it shows it hooked

1383
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:03,800
up to a receiver.

1384
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:04,800
Yeah.

1385
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:05,800
I see that.

1386
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,800
To like a Pioneer or something.

1387
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:08,800
Also it will-

1388
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:09,800
That's what I've done.

1389
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:10,800
Yeah.

1390
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:13,400
It will also connect to the speakers using Bluetooth so I could just pair it to the Bose

1391
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:14,400
Bluetooth speaker.

1392
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:15,400
Exactly.

1393
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:16,400
Yeah.

1394
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:24,560
So at the Makerspace, we paired an Echo Dot to a Bluetooth speaker to improve its speakers.

1395
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:33,560
And during Cyber Dark Black Tuesday, Friday, whatever it's called, they were doing three

1396
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:39,240
Echo Dots for a combined discounted price of like $60 or something.

1397
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:40,240
Wow.

1398
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:41,240
This is a very...

1399
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:42,240
That's a very compelling that they're having that-

1400
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:43,240
Are they sending it to the Hue lights?

1401
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:44,240
Oh, man.

1402
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:45,240
Yeah.

1403
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:46,240
They're sending it to the studio.

1404
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:47,240
So that just seems like a-

1405
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:50,240
I just want this in my room so I can be like, hey, turn on my lights when I wake up or hey,

1406
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:53,120
turn them off at night without having to go hit the switch, which is really far away.

1407
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:58,020
That's what I'm interested in because I've identified as a lights project as something

1408
01:04:58,020 --> 01:05:05,180
that is going to have wife acceptance factor and also sort of in-law acceptance factor

1409
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:08,360
because they've already got a sort of a lighting system.

1410
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:12,920
And I want to experiment with the Dot to do control of lighting.

1411
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:14,480
Yes, for sure.

1412
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:19,280
And I wonder, you know, if I got just a couple of smart plugs, I could make all of these

1413
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:20,280
lights controllable.

1414
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:24,700
One thing I noticed in discussion of this is that it seems like busy people or people

1415
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:29,000
with children are very interested in these products, just in the kind of direct accessibility,

1416
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,960
the kind of a lot of times in busy situations, you can use your voice when you can't use

1417
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:36,320
your hands or sit down to do something more complicated.

1418
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:40,120
Like I'm coming in the door at home and my hands are full of my bag for the day and my

1419
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:41,120
groceries.

1420
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:42,120
It'd be nice to just-

1421
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:43,120
But you still need information or you want to turn-

1422
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:44,120
Turn on the lights.

1423
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:50,840
For those of you, for those of you that want to do like IoT stuff, but without the development,

1424
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:57,800
Alexa was recently added to IFTTT so you can do if this, then that rules and hook Alexa

1425
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:05,120
up to all the other pipes that IFTTT supports.

1426
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:07,800
You know, the only thing I wish, does anybody know-

1427
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:10,640
Which includes Hue lights and all the rest of it.

1428
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:14,440
So the Echo runs on what, Fire OS?

1429
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:15,440
What does it do?

1430
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,680
Do we know what the underlying operating system is to the Echo?

1431
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,280
Is it Linux?

1432
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:20,280
You would have to think so.

1433
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:21,280
Probably broken.

1434
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:24,200
It's probably not BSD.

1435
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:25,840
It's probably Linux.

1436
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:26,840
So it's-

1437
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:27,840
Just based on their other-

1438
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:28,840
Who knows?

1439
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:29,840
It's safe to put in LadyJuice.

1440
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:30,840
It's safe.

1441
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:31,840
Well, it's only Linux and LadyJuice.

1442
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:32,840
Right.

1443
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:33,840
So that's the thing.

1444
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:34,840
Well, okay.

1445
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:36,240
Maybe you have to take it down and see what you can find out.

1446
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:39,960
Well, now that we've all made Chris, boy, I can actually see a pretty cool episode out

1447
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:40,960
of this too.

1448
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:41,960
I could-

1449
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:42,960
Oh, yeah.

1450
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:43,960
And specifically talking about how to make it work with Linux.

1451
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:44,960
Oh my gosh.

1452
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:45,960
Now I'm going to sell it to myself.

1453
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:46,960
I got to stop.

1454
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:47,960
It's happening.

1455
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:48,960
It's happening, everyone.

1456
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:51,080
Well, I hope you enjoyed this half of the show.

1457
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:54,680
I don't know how much more show we have, but I want to now get us ready to transition over

1458
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:57,200
to Grand Forks, North Dakota.

1459
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:00,280
I want to also let you know that coming up on the Linux Action Show, and probably this

1460
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:03,360
show too, we'll be doing our 2017 predictions soon.

1461
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:07,720
So I'd love to get the conversation rolling on that, linuxactionshow.reddit.com, if you

1462
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:13,360
have thoughts about 2017, you can leave in the comments here, or start a thread, I don't

1463
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:18,320
give an S, or just tweet them at me, at Chris L-A-S, and we'll start talking about that

1464
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:19,360
very soon.

1465
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,400
So what we're going to do now is a little internet magic.

1466
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:26,520
We'll hit pause on our end, and when it comes back, you'll be hearing from Mr. Colonel Linux.

1467
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:32,160
Something a little different.

1468
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:35,720
Live from Grand Forks, North Dakota, the show that puts you, the listener, in the driver's

1469
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:37,960
seat because you are the content.

1470
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:40,000
The phone lines are open to be a part of the program.

1471
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Give us a call.

1472
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:49,320
It's toll free, 1-877-347-0011, and we'll talk about your tech problems, or your business

1473
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:50,800
and tech problems.

1474
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:54,420
Linux advocate, above all else, small business owner, and now host of the only show that

1475
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:58,960
centered around you, the audience, welcome to Ask Noah.

1476
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:02,520
And as you might have guessed, I am Noah.

1477
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:11,000
Now this show, well this particular episode really, was born right at the end of LASS.

1478
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:16,280
Basically Chris said, I want to see, can we get a show up and running in 48 hours?

1479
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:19,680
And so this is the test of that.

1480
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:23,120
The job looks much easier from the outside than it actually is.

1481
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:26,840
To actually get all of the equipment set up, get everything tested, get levels right, get

1482
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:31,640
the recording set up, get the graphics rolling, all of that, it takes time.

1483
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:34,960
And so I don't have all of the equipment I want.

1484
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:37,480
I don't have things set up the way I want it to.

1485
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:42,700
But we're going to try this and see if we can take calls, if this works.

1486
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:48,880
So you call in 1-877-347-0011 and we'll talk.

1487
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:52,880
Ask any question you want, ask it about Linux, ask it about technology in general, or ask

1488
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,720
it about business.

1489
01:08:55,720 --> 01:09:01,440
We're going to start going out to the phones and let's see here, who do we have?

1490
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:08,940
We're going to start with Justin from Boston, Massachusetts.

1491
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:14,000
So there's a little bit of a delay right now for the way that our call system is set up.

1492
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:19,480
Justin will be here with us in a second and I'll take his questions.

1493
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:24,780
I made a post on Reddit a while back about business and how we set everything up and

1494
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:30,840
how we got things rolling here at AltaSpeed and that post got so many likes and so many

1495
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,320
other follow-up questions.

1496
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:34,060
People sent me emails.

1497
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:40,060
People went online and sent in contact forms and got a hold of me.

1498
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:43,400
All sorts of different ways.

1499
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:47,840
So if you have a business question, you can answer that as well.

1500
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:51,080
So Justin, you're with us and you're here from Boston, Massachusetts I believe.

1501
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:52,080
Hello.

1502
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,080
Welcome to Ask Noah.

1503
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:54,080
Hey Noah.

1504
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:55,080
How's it going?

1505
01:09:55,080 --> 01:10:03,880
So it's a bit of a complicated setup but it comes down to this.

1506
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:11,900
I am looking at building a personal infrastructure for a replacement Google Drive.

1507
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:17,420
After some price hikes with Google Drive, some file manipulations on Amazon Drive and

1508
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:22,400
other cloud services, I've gotten really, really tired of trying to put terabytes of

1509
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:26,280
data somewhere that is not physically at my home.

1510
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:27,280
Gotcha.

1511
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,280
Okay.

1512
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:33,960
So I've got this idea of putting together a few boxes, putting NextCloud on these boxes

1513
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:38,200
and sort of replacing Google Drive with that.

1514
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:44,800
However, I've heard you and Chris, among others, have some issues with large amounts of data

1515
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:49,000
with own cloud and NextCloud being a successor.

1516
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:54,720
I have that same worry but I also wonder about multi-user support and if you guys have had

1517
01:10:54,720 --> 01:11:01,960
experience with that because this is a solution for tens of people and the ability to scale

1518
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:03,440
this up if need be.

1519
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:08,960
Currently, the plan is two or three machines that are going to be targeted from the desktop

1520
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:14,200
client and then these two or three machines would be essentially their own redundancy.

1521
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:18,040
If one goes down, the others pick up the slack and so forth.

1522
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:19,040
Gotcha.

1523
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,680
So I'll tell you what my experience has been.

1524
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:25,720
I was one of the early adopters of own cloud, Chris was as well, and we used own cloud extensively

1525
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:31,600
and what we found was it worked fine for syncing documents, for syncing pictures.

1526
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:37,880
Large amount of files weren't a problem but when you took a 20 or 30 or 40 gigabyte file

1527
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:43,000
and tried to sync that across multiple machines, what we found was you'd get files that were

1528
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:48,740
corrupted and occasionally you'd have some files that were missed entirely altogether.

1529
01:11:48,740 --> 01:11:51,580
I have found that most of those problems have been resolved.

1530
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:55,800
I was on the last version of own cloud before the split and I tried it with some test data

1531
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:59,640
and ran that for a while and that seemed to work pretty well.

1532
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:02,280
If you watched the last week's episode of the Linux Action Show, we actually talked

1533
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:09,900
to Joss from the NextCloud project and they have continued to approve upon the technology

1534
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:13,080
and feature set that own cloud left behind.

1535
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:14,940
I have some lingering concerns.

1536
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:17,400
First of all, I have some concerns with the database that they're using.

1537
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:22,380
It is possible to swap it out, it's possible to point it to something other than SQLite.

1538
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:26,320
The other thing I have a concern with is with the syncing application, it's using CSYNC

1539
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:34,760
on the backend and the entire workhorse is essentially written in PHP and I'm not a coder

1540
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:38,600
and I don't necessarily claim to understand some of the underpinnings of this but everyone

1541
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:45,880
that is in the know tells me that the choices of technology that they have used are not

1542
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:46,880
the best.

1543
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:50,480
I'm going between two different options right now.

1544
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:55,180
My first option is I'm looking at C file for doing file syncing but I'm actually also looking

1545
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:59,960
at building a file server for our company to sync all of our files and we're still considering

1546
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:00,960
NextCloud.

1547
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:06,360
Joss actually talks about how they actually have deployments of large users, universities

1548
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:07,360
so to speak.

1549
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:10,240
If you haven't seen it, I'd suggest you go check out that episode because it does a very

1550
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:14,920
good job of explaining how NextCloud does scale.

1551
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:18,560
I would be willing to give it a shot I think if I were you as in fact I'm going to do the

1552
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:19,560
same.

1553
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:30,960
With that in mind, with your experience, how reliable is it in its rescanning I guess?

1554
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:36,800
One of my concerns is I've, albeit in a virtual machine network, I have set up a few instances

1555
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:44,440
of on cloud and it's nice to start out by just throwing data into the data directory

1556
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:50,680
itself and letting NextCloud rescan and everything appears really nicely in the web interface

1557
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:56,640
but that isn't always super viable and I've noticed that with the desktop client certain

1558
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:59,480
folder names will just be ignored.

1559
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:07,200
For example, I have a folder called archives and I have to explicitly rescan with that

1560
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:11,000
folder being an exception list to get that folder to appear in the web archive or pulled

1561
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
down by other users.

1562
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,120
Are these the kind of problems that you've had experience with?

1563
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:18,220
Yep, I've experienced almost all of those.

1564
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:24,580
I have found that the way to make own cloud the happiest is to install the client, point

1565
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:28,660
it towards whatever directory you're going to use and then give it a couple of minutes

1566
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:32,760
to kind of sync itself up and then start adding data to that directory.

1567
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:37,240
The worst possible thing you can do is climb in under the hood and start moving data around

1568
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:38,240
on the server.

1569
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:43,200
I have destroyed my entire own cloud instance, well my user account anyway, all of my data.

1570
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,960
I've erased all of my data by doing stuff like that.

1571
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:53,380
So I would encourage you to be pretty cautious in that regard but I think it's pretty much

1572
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:54,580
ready for prime time.

1573
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:59,680
I think I would go ahead and give it a shot.

1574
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:05,160
And again, I'll be able to tell you more as time goes on because I'm going to be implementing

1575
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:06,160
this myself.

1576
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:08,120
I'm going to try Nextcloud and see if it works.

1577
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:12,400
I looked into the commercial alternatives like Dropbox and that's kind of the go-to

1578
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:15,620
if you're in the business world is you sign up for Dropbox for business.

1579
01:15:15,620 --> 01:15:20,680
But they're charging, I think it's something like $9 a user or something.

1580
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:29,160
We have a small team and file syncing is not a central part of our business so the idea

1581
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:35,860
that I would be able to afford that kind of capital stream for the return on the investment

1582
01:15:35,860 --> 01:15:36,860
just isn't there.

1583
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:40,040
We're going to head back over to Washington State right where Chris came from.

1584
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,040
Sean's joining us.

1585
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:42,040
Hi Sean, how are you?

1586
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:43,040
Hey Noah.

1587
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:44,040
Hey, thanks for joining us.

1588
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,040
How can we help today?

1589
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:52,680
So me and a couple of my friends are looking at starting a podcast, just us sitting around

1590
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:58,960
shooting the breeze about technology and we got some mics, we got some computers and not

1591
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:02,320
really sure where to go there from next.

1592
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:06,180
Are you guys doing audio only or are you doing audio and video?

1593
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:07,180
Audio only.

1594
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:08,240
Awesome.

1595
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:10,240
So never do video.

1596
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:14,480
If you go talk to anyone that's doing video in the podcast, they'll tell you that they

1597
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:19,560
would give, they'd trade their soul to the devil to go back in time and never do video.

1598
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:21,280
Audio is actually pretty easy to do.

1599
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:29,000
I have tried, I've used Skype and Mumble side by side and there's a lot of people that will

1600
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:34,280
tell you that Skype is a very high quality piece of software.

1601
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:36,360
I think Skype works okay.

1602
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:43,120
I found that conference calling in Skype can be difficult at best and also I believe it's

1603
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:48,720
Silk, the Kodak or a modified version of Silk that is the Kodak that's being used in Skype.

1604
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:56,080
My understanding is that a future version of that or a built upon version of that is

1605
01:16:56,080 --> 01:17:02,240
the Opus Kodak which is what can be used in Mumble and also there is a growing number

1606
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:08,360
of people that are using G.722 or 729, one of the two.

1607
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:14,960
I can double check and get back to you but the G.722 is basically what they've done is

1608
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:20,840
they have built upon what was a phone standard and built it out and so if you look at, I

1609
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:26,920
actually had the opportunity to try some inter-price grade audio connection tools that were basically

1610
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:31,280
designed to facilitate remote studio connections and they were using the G.722 Kodak.

1611
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:38,340
That Kodak is available in software like Zoiper and so you can set up a conference call between

1612
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:42,440
three or four participants or five participants and you could actually use the exact same

1613
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:47,000
Kodak as the industry professionals were using.

1614
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,520
If you have mics and you have audio interfaces and you're just looking for the connection

1615
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:51,520
piece, that's an option.

1616
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:54,200
If you want something simpler, Mumble is a great way to go too.

1617
01:17:54,200 --> 01:18:01,720
Yeah, because I'll be doing everything on Linux but the other two guys have, one uses

1618
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:05,680
Linux and Windows and one uses just Windows, so.

1619
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:06,680
Okay, great.

1620
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:13,520
Well, I really appreciate you taking the time to call in again, 1-877-347-0011.

1621
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:18,900
That's the number and we'll take your calls, we'll answer your questions.

1622
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:23,580
It is really fun to be able to actually do this.

1623
01:18:23,580 --> 01:18:25,960
Every day I'm solving problems on Linux.

1624
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:28,880
I'm going through and trying this stuff.

1625
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:32,560
This Kodak thing was one thing that I was looking at doing because obviously we're looking

1626
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:37,920
at implementing something like this on JB and so as I have gone through and kind of experimented

1627
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:41,800
with this, I can't really make an episode about it but Sean calls in from Washington

1628
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:45,600
and says that he wants to facilitate remote connection between him and his friends to

1629
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:46,600
do a podcast.

1630
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:48,100
Well, now we're talking, right?

1631
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:50,400
Now that's something that we can do.

1632
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:57,280
James, North Carolina, you're calling in about System D. How can we help?

1633
01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:05,200
Oh, yes, I was calling about some, I guess, more general recommendations with Ubuntu and

1634
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:07,640
I primarily use Linux myself.

1635
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:14,520
Switching over to System D from Upstart, a lot of programs that I had used for programming

1636
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:20,800
things like automatic triggers for like green dimming when power disconnects from a laptop

1637
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:26,960
or things like that no longer work with System D. So I was just curious if you guys have

1638
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:32,480
any recommendations of like programs that you can interact with those System D triggers

1639
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:35,640
to do things.

1640
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:36,640
That's interesting.

1641
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:43,920
So I have done a number of different upgrades in the last couple of years moving from – to

1642
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:47,240
the latest version of RHEL which of course uses System D and it's interesting.

1643
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:53,240
I have worked with some pretty esoteric pieces of software and I've not run into that issue.

1644
01:19:53,240 --> 01:20:00,080
Most of those calls are set up so that it just translates any of those Upstart commands

1645
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:07,440
right to System D. It seems like it's pretty smoother, RedSK, System D, but do you have

1646
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:11,920
some custom stuff that is written in there, custom stuff that it's calling or custom

1647
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,560
things that it's doing?

1648
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:14,560
No.

1649
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:17,360
Oh, I just remembered the name of it.

1650
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:18,360
It's called Cuttlefish.

1651
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:24,320
It was a program that would essentially tie into some of the triggers for things like

1652
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:32,480
when you log on, if you I guess disconnect from your session, if you put the laptop to

1653
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:35,800
sleep, wake it up, that kind of deal.

1654
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:41,680
So you could basically connect that to any type of bash script and you could have it

1655
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:47,320
run as triggered or you could have it do a few preset actions as well.

1656
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:52,200
Yeah, so I guess I'll tell you what I'll do.

1657
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:57,080
If you head over to jupyterbroadcasting.com, click on the contact link, click on Ask Noah.

1658
01:20:57,080 --> 01:21:01,480
I don't have any great recommendations for you but I know a guy that knows everything

1659
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:10,120
there is to know about moving older init systems to System D and if you send me a contact form,

1660
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:13,080
I'll put you in contact with him and I'll see if you guys can get together and see if

1661
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:18,440
you guys can work something out because I'm sure there's somebody that has run through

1662
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:19,440
this.

1663
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,000
For me, it has been a marvelous experience.

1664
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,400
Moving to System D has been flawless.

1665
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:28,720
In fact, the only thing that I've really noticed is my boot times have gone from like a minute,

1666
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:31,560
minute and a half down to mere seconds.

1667
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:35,360
That's the big difference for me from moving from the older init systems to System D. So

1668
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:40,960
I really don't have any complaints and like I said, I worked with some pretty esoteric

1669
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:41,960
pieces of software.

1670
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:48,000
I worked with the university on some chemical calculation software that I mean, it was just

1671
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:52,720
a tiny little company and it's a very, very limited use case and all of that stuff worked

1672
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:54,960
perfectly right out of the box.

1673
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:56,920
Angela is calling from Washington.

1674
01:21:56,920 --> 01:21:59,280
I have a feeling I might have talked to you before.

1675
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:02,560
Yeah, it may be possibly.

1676
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:08,680
I don't actually have a question but I thought it would be cool to let you know that back

1677
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:17,520
in 2015 at Linux Fest Northwest, my friend Jenny gave you her Mac laptop and asked you

1678
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:25,220
to fix it, which is laughable in its own and you gave her a Linux laptop.

1679
01:22:25,220 --> 01:22:30,280
She has been using that for the last year and a half but not like super well and she's

1680
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:34,920
trying to finish up her AA degree, which she only needs about three or four classes to

1681
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:45,920
complete and she is choosing to go back to school and taking CIS 105 intro to Linux with

1682
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:46,920
that laptop.

1683
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:53,040
I thought that you should be able to have that credit and know that she is dabbling

1684
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:57,040
now in Linux to a deeper level.

1685
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,040
That's outstanding.

1686
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:03,360
You know what's funny about that is I think I was the only one participating in that conversation.

1687
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:04,800
I'll leave this out for you guys.

1688
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:10,040
So we're at dinner and her friend Jenny is telling me about how her laptop is having

1689
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:11,440
some troubles not working.

1690
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:15,800
Turns out like the motherboard was like totally dead and so I said, if I send you a Linux

1691
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:16,800
computer would you use it?

1692
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:21,920
She kind of looks at me like I'm crazy, two eyes, one eye and she's like yeah, I guess

1693
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:25,760
and so I got back to Grand Forks and I set a computer up and I shipped it off to her

1694
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:29,440
and I get a message from, I think it was, I think you Angela actually sent me a message

1695
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:33,320
and here's a picture of this computer and she's like why did a laptop just arrive at

1696
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:34,800
our house and what is it for?

1697
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:38,920
I'm like well, it's for Jenny, it's for Jenny and so yeah, so anyway, so that's how she

1698
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:40,080
wound up with that computer.

1699
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:44,720
It's not a, it's not a, it's not a, you know, any terribly nice computer but it's something

1700
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:48,400
that if you're just using daily stuff I think it gets you along, it gets her along just

1701
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:49,400
fine, right?

1702
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:50,400
Yep, it does.

1703
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:55,240
It does and now she's just going to be more confident in it and gosh, I feel like she's

1704
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:58,680
going to know more about Linux than I will after taking this course.

1705
01:23:58,680 --> 01:23:59,680
Well that's awesome.

1706
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:05,680
Thank you very much for the update and please make sure to give Jenny the number 1-877-3400-11.

1707
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:13,200
I have to memorize my own number.

1708
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:23,640
That would be good, 1-877-3400-11, 1-877-3400-11, someday I'll have that totally memorized and

1709
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:26,080
I won't have that issue.

1710
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:31,160
I love giving Linux to people that don't have a predisposition to it.

1711
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:34,720
I love giving Linux to people that don't already have it made up in their mind that

1712
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:37,880
they're going to like Linux or they're going to hate Linux, Linux is going to work, Linux

1713
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:39,600
is not going to work.

1714
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:44,960
The people that can just evaluate it from the standpoint of I have a need, I have a

1715
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:47,960
task, I want to get that task done, how do I do that task?

1716
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:49,680
That's where Linux is going to succeed.

1717
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:53,520
Really that's where any operating system succeeds because if you take me as a Linux

1718
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:58,080
user and put me on a Windows environment or a Mac environment, I'm going to have a tough

1719
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:01,080
time too.

1720
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:03,920
The inspiration for this show is pretty simple.

1721
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:07,280
My company, AltaSpeed Technologies, we've spent the last couple of years perfecting

1722
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:11,560
providing creative cost saving solutions to our customers without sacrificing quality

1723
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:13,880
using open source software.

1724
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:20,000
We go into a place, to a business that their budget is they spend $500 per workstation

1725
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,000
for an office week.

1726
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,640
We tell them we're going to provide that to them at nothing.

1727
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:24,760
They're just going to pay us for their time.

1728
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:31,360
They say that they're paying X amount of thousands of dollars to hire this in-house mail administrator

1729
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:35,920
guy that is going to work on this crappy exchange server that works less than 50% of the time.

1730
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:39,400
We show them other solutions and we're going to take that knowledge and we are going to

1731
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:45,280
morph that into a show and provide those answers to you not at our billing rate of $75 an hour

1732
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:49,040
but we're going to give that to you for free just by calling the number.

1733
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:53,520
I think this has the potential to morph into a really successful show.

1734
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:58,040
I hope it morphs into a really successful show and so I want to thank everyone for taking

1735
01:25:58,040 --> 01:26:03,280
the time to be here, for being on the phone lines, waiting on hold, particularly those

1736
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:04,280
of you that are calling internationally.

1737
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:10,600
It is a toll free call though, 1-877-347-0011 so I would never be worried about calling.

1738
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:12,480
It won't cost you anything.

1739
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,840
That will bring us to the end of this week's test episode.

1740
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:19,200
Keep that number guys, 1-877-347-0011.

1741
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:22,480
We'll be back with you soon for another couple of test episodes and of course finally the

1742
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:25,120
official launch of the YAS NOAH program.

1743
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:27,520
Now if you want to support this program as well as the rest of the network, head over

1744
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:29,760
to patreon.com slash today.

1745
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:33,520
You can directly participate in getting this program off the ground.

1746
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:37,320
Special thanks to Sarah, our producer, Ham Radio, our call screener and of course Rekai,

Make sure to tune in next week for their clip segment.

1751
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:52,320
Have a merry Christmas, a happy new year and I'll see all of you guys on Sunday for our

1752
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:54,840
predictions episode in the next two weeks.

1753
01:26:54,840 --> 01:27:19,880
You guys have a great night.

1754
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:25,440
We have, who do we have here, Ryan, Portland, Port Orchard, Washington.

1755
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,440
Welcome to YAS NOAH.

1756
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:27,440
Hey, how's it going?

1757
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:28,440
Excellent.

1758
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:31,840
How can we help today?

1759
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:38,760
So you mentioned on an episode of last recently that you switched over to ARCH on all your

1760
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:44,200
boxes because you're kind of like little things like functioning network manager and all.

1761
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:45,280
Right, yeah, I'm weird like that.

1762
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:47,240
I really prefer my wireless to work, yeah.

1763
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:50,160
What are you trying to live in the future or something?

1764
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:51,160
Come on, man.

1765
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:52,160
I know it's crazy.

1766
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:55,320
I'm a whore for the details.

1767
01:27:55,320 --> 01:28:00,720
So I was wondering what made you choose ARCH specifically over something like Ubuntu Mate

1768
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:06,760
which doesn't seem to have all the same issues as standard Ubuntu.

1769
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:07,760
A couple of things.

1770
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:13,600
The first and foremost factor that really led me to ARCH was these days I move more

1771
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:18,520
and I'm spending more and more time doing things for Jupiter Broadcasting and so it

1772
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:23,600
makes a lot of sense to use the same environment stuff that the other people you're interfacing

1773
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:24,600
with do, right?

1774
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:27,160
And that was one of the reasons that drew me to Fedora early on is because I was dealing

1775
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:32,560
with so much Red Hat that it just made sense to have Fedora on my desktop and these days

1776
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:35,720
every Sunday at least I'm doing something and if there's an app pic that we're doing

1777
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:40,880
that week it's really nice to be able to have access to the same applications as everyone

1778
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:41,880
else.

1779
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:46,880
The other side of it too is that I have some ground to step up on and say, okay, I tried

1780
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:47,880
ARCH.

1781
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:48,880
I ran it for X amount of months.

1782
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:53,320
Here's why it didn't end up working for me and then I can put that baby to rest and I

1783
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:57,360
don't have to constantly – because right now or at least prior to that it was always

1784
01:28:57,360 --> 01:29:01,080
well, I'm using Ubuntu and there's all these people out there telling me that there's

1785
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:02,880
this better Linux experience available.

1786
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:06,640
Really what I found is I have probably the same amount of problems.

1787
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:09,920
I just – they are more solvable, number one.

1788
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:14,640
Number two, I expect to have to solve them and number three is they're not – well

1789
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:15,720
that's not entirely true.

1790
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:20,200
Some of them are kind of show stopping problems but so far they've all mostly been solvable

1791
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:24,560
or tolerable and not having wireless in Ubuntu was not that way.

1792
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:30,760
Now as for why I didn't choose Ubuntu Mate, the Mate desktop does not offer the ability

1793
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:33,840
at least out of the box, I think they're including it, to launch an application by

1794
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:38,440
hitting the super key and I have – it is so ingrained in my mind when I want Firefox,

1795
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:43,240
I hit super key, F-I-R-E, enter and then I expect Firefox to be on my screen or super

1796
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:47,480
key, T-H-U-N, enter and I expect Thunderbird to be on my screen.

1797
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:52,720
Without those – it's a difference in how I use the computer and I'm really not willing

1798
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:53,720
to make that change.

1799
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:57,000
Other things you can do, you can use Synapsys, in fact I think they're including Elantra

1800
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:03,020
by default but it's – I see Ubuntu Mate as my utilitarian type distro.

1801
01:30:03,020 --> 01:30:07,320
So the computer I'm on right now for example is running Ubuntu Mate because it's just

1802
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:10,680
an appliance, it's a computer that needs to sit there and it doesn't need to be pretty,

1803
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:14,480
it doesn't need to switch desktops, I just need to open OBS for example and just have

1804
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:15,600
it run.

1805
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:24,360
That was not the case, that is not the case with my desktop, on my laptop.

1806
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:30,720
So that's the short answer why I wound up on Arch.

1807
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:35,200
Mostly happy – the latest thing that really bit me that I was super upset about was I

1808
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:41,120
went to open Lightworks to edit a – or not Lightworks, Inkscape to edit a graphic and

1809
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:42,120
Inkscape just wouldn't load.

1810
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:43,840
Like I would click on the icon, nothing would happen.

1811
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:49,280
So I had to drop to the terminal and then I ran the Inkscape command and then it gave

1812
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:52,460
me some error that I didn't entirely understand, I had to Google the error and then I'm going

1813
01:30:52,460 --> 01:30:55,560
through and I'm going around and somewhere through there I was like, you know, I have

1814
01:30:55,560 --> 01:31:00,480
some tolerance when it's TeamViewer or some other non-proprietary piece of software but

1815
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:05,760
like Inkscape, Inkscape is like a huge vector graphic, open source vector graphic editing

1816
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:06,760
suite for Linux.

1817
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:11,640
How in the world do you get to a point where you can't – where that doesn't work?

1818
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:12,640
How is that a thing?

1819
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:13,800
It doesn't even make sense to me.

1820
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:31,080
So I was a little upset by that but got it to work and I guess it's worked now so far.
