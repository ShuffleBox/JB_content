WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.360
This is great for us now that we're really an audio show.

00:02.360 --> 00:04.080
There's a pair of sunglasses out there

00:04.080 --> 00:06.080
that would have made a great sponsor back in the day

00:06.080 --> 00:08.040
when we had sponsors.

00:08.040 --> 00:11.480
They block out all of the screens around you.

00:11.480 --> 00:14.000
And it's not actually all of that tricky.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.800
There is a company out there called

00:15.800 --> 00:18.500
Casper that makes not the mattress company.

00:18.500 --> 00:20.400
I guess it's a different company that

00:20.400 --> 00:23.100
makes a screen blocking film.

00:23.100 --> 00:27.080
And one entrepreneur with a last name of Blow, I think,

00:27.080 --> 00:29.120
or Blue, I can't remember his last name,

00:29.120 --> 00:32.200
he popped out the lenses in these cheap old sunglasses,

00:32.200 --> 00:34.960
put a pair on with this film over it,

00:34.960 --> 00:37.280
and then set off into the city and realized

00:37.280 --> 00:40.680
that he was blocking all of the televisions around him.

00:40.680 --> 00:42.800
All the annoying signs that use TVs,

00:42.800 --> 00:44.800
all the TVs in the bar that you're going to,

00:44.800 --> 00:46.880
and you don't care about that sports game on there.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.180
You don't have to see it anymore.

00:48.180 --> 00:50.400
So his name is Blue, B-L-E-W.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.280
And they're the IRL glasses.

00:52.280 --> 00:57.020
Yeah, they've even formed a company and, you guessed it,

00:57.020 --> 00:58.240
a Kickstarter.

00:58.240 --> 00:59.400
They've got a Kickstarter.

00:59.400 --> 01:03.200
Wow, they've raised $5,000 since we went on the air.

01:03.200 --> 01:04.160
That's not bad.

01:04.160 --> 01:07.400
When I first loaded this page about a half hour ago,

01:07.400 --> 01:08.760
they were at $75,000.

01:08.760 --> 01:13.280
Now they're at $80,000 with 1,207 backers

01:13.280 --> 01:15.560
with 21 days left to go.

01:15.560 --> 01:18.760
You can see everything except screens, they say.

01:18.760 --> 01:21.180
Yeah, I guess, actually, anything

01:21.180 --> 01:25.300
that is just a polarized lens rotated 90 degrees

01:25.300 --> 01:27.280
and then flattened can produce the same effect.

01:27.280 --> 01:30.260
You don't actually need this one company's special film.

01:30.260 --> 01:31.920
So you can go play with this right now.

01:31.920 --> 01:34.600
And it won't block OLED screens.

01:34.600 --> 01:36.120
If you ever try to lie on a sun lounger

01:36.120 --> 01:38.280
and read your phone with sunglasses on,

01:38.280 --> 01:41.200
sometimes you get the same thing.

01:41.200 --> 01:43.960
Have you ever gone swimming with polarized sunglasses on?

01:43.960 --> 01:45.840
It's pretty cool.

01:45.840 --> 01:48.680
This is one of those kinds of things that I wouldn't mind,

01:48.680 --> 01:51.080
but you'd have to bring a pair for everybody.

01:51.080 --> 01:53.720
You go sit down at a restaurant and you're

01:53.720 --> 01:55.640
wearing these sunglasses, it'd be distracting

01:55.640 --> 01:57.320
for everybody at the table.

01:57.320 --> 01:58.800
They get used to it just a couple times.

01:58.800 --> 02:00.520
Oh, that's that weird thing Chris does.

02:00.520 --> 02:03.680
Now you've got to bring a pair for everybody.

02:03.680 --> 02:19.880
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 270 for October 9, 2018.

02:19.880 --> 02:22.440
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

02:22.440 --> 02:25.200
that's drying the tears of those G Plus users.

02:25.200 --> 02:25.960
My name is Chris.

02:25.960 --> 02:26.640
My name is Wes.

02:26.640 --> 02:28.040
Hello, Wes.

02:28.040 --> 02:31.480
We do have some Google news to get into today, but not too

02:31.480 --> 02:31.960
much.

02:31.960 --> 02:33.480
We won't overwhelm me because then we

02:33.480 --> 02:37.800
have some big Plasma desktop news, some upcoming GNOME

02:37.800 --> 02:40.440
announcements, as well as a bit of a GNOME history lesson.

02:40.440 --> 02:42.440
We're going to go back to the good old days

02:42.440 --> 02:46.420
when Linux on the desktop wasn't a joke, it was the hype.

02:46.420 --> 02:48.080
And it's actually where that saying,

02:48.080 --> 02:49.540
the year of Linux desktop came from.

02:49.540 --> 02:51.640
We're going to go back to that era

02:51.640 --> 02:53.280
and look at some fascinating times that

02:53.280 --> 02:57.080
resulted in software that we're still using today,

02:57.080 --> 02:58.640
but you might not know its heritage.

02:58.640 --> 02:59.520
We'll dig into that.

02:59.520 --> 03:02.720
Then later on the show, we've made no secret about it.

03:02.720 --> 03:07.840
We are big fans of Red Hat's Project Stratus.

03:07.840 --> 03:10.840
It's a tool, or a layer really, that's

03:10.840 --> 03:13.080
bringing a bunch of existing technologies

03:13.080 --> 03:16.960
together on Linux to compete with CFS

03:16.960 --> 03:20.160
and offer some of the same feature sets as ButterFS,

03:20.160 --> 03:23.200
but using established technologies like XFS,

03:23.200 --> 03:24.800
the DM layer of the Linux kernel,

03:24.800 --> 03:27.440
some of the same exact tools that LVM uses today.

03:27.440 --> 03:29.040
And Andy is one of the lead developers

03:29.040 --> 03:30.800
behind Project Stratus, and he's going

03:30.800 --> 03:33.720
to come on and give us the high level pitch of what it does,

03:33.720 --> 03:36.000
what it is, and then answer some of our questions that

03:36.000 --> 03:38.400
get down into the weeds.

03:38.400 --> 03:41.760
And after that, I'm getting organized,

03:41.760 --> 03:44.600
and I am using this week's app pick to do it.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.400
I'll share the app pick for you that I'm

03:46.400 --> 03:48.880
using to get my life in order, for goodness sake.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.300
But before we go any further, we've

03:50.300 --> 03:52.480
got to bring in that virtual lug time appropriate.

03:52.480 --> 03:54.160
Greetings, Mumble Room.

03:54.160 --> 03:57.040
Good evening, morning, greetings, wake up, and smell.

03:57.040 --> 03:58.640
Howdy, y'all.

03:58.640 --> 03:59.600
Love it.

03:59.600 --> 04:02.760
Hello, Mr. Badger, Mini Mac, Popey, Sean, Spazzy C,

04:02.760 --> 04:03.320
and Wimpy.

04:03.320 --> 04:07.240
It is good to have you in the virtual lug today.

04:07.240 --> 04:10.560
Let's just get the elephant out of the room.

04:10.560 --> 04:11.880
Big story this week.

04:11.880 --> 04:15.680
Google Plus is shutting down in the wake of a bit of a data

04:15.680 --> 04:19.540
leak, and maybe the bigger part of the story

04:19.540 --> 04:23.320
is that Google tried to keep it under wraps.

04:23.320 --> 04:26.040
And we're learning about this from a Wall Street Journal

04:26.040 --> 04:30.200
report that got memos from within Google.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.760
And the really damning stuff about this

04:32.760 --> 04:35.740
is these memos make it clear that leadership,

04:35.740 --> 04:38.760
such as the chief executive, Sunder Pichai,

04:38.760 --> 04:43.280
was briefed on the plan not to notify users, which

04:43.280 --> 04:45.360
he signed off on.

04:45.360 --> 04:46.720
This is a huge story, and it seems

04:46.720 --> 04:50.880
that there was a, quote, glitch in an API for Google Plus

04:50.880 --> 04:55.600
between 2015 and March of 2018 when an internal Google

04:55.600 --> 04:57.800
investigation discovered and then immediately attempted

04:57.800 --> 04:58.760
to fix the issue.

04:58.760 --> 05:00.200
This is one of the reasons why they didn't

05:00.200 --> 05:01.280
make a disclosure about it.

05:01.280 --> 05:04.560
It wasn't that somebody came to them and then got a bug bounty.

05:04.560 --> 05:07.160
It was that Google found this during its own internal audit,

05:07.160 --> 05:09.580
which is commendable in some ways.

05:09.580 --> 05:12.320
The memo reviewed by the journal prepared by Google's legal

05:12.320 --> 05:14.880
and policy staff and then shared with senior executives

05:14.880 --> 05:17.100
warned that disclosing the incident

05:17.100 --> 05:20.640
would likely trigger immediate regulatory interest

05:20.640 --> 05:23.080
and invite comparisons to Facebook's leak of user

05:23.080 --> 05:25.600
information from Cambridge Analytica.

05:25.600 --> 05:27.480
They did have some considerations, though.

05:27.480 --> 05:30.760
So whether we could accurately identify the users to inform,

05:30.760 --> 05:33.260
whether there was any actual evidence of misuse,

05:33.260 --> 05:35.920
and whether there were any actions a developer or user

05:35.920 --> 05:38.440
could actually take in response, they didn't find those.

05:38.440 --> 05:42.120
And that was one of the reasons they gave for not telling us.

05:42.120 --> 05:43.800
Which is kind of understandable.

05:43.800 --> 05:46.760
They believe it was never abused by any third party

05:46.760 --> 05:47.800
application.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.200
It is sort of a gray area.

05:49.200 --> 05:50.840
I mean, it is our data, and I would

05:50.840 --> 05:52.500
like to know about what happens with it

05:52.500 --> 05:54.040
and how well protected it is.

05:54.040 --> 05:58.360
But are we really entitled to that?

05:58.360 --> 06:01.320
It seems like for the benefit of the industry, it's good.

06:01.320 --> 06:05.100
You know, it's good to be clear about this stuff.

06:05.100 --> 06:08.080
The way Google handled this announcement, I think,

06:08.080 --> 06:11.460
is a lesson in brilliant marketing.

06:11.460 --> 06:15.760
I don't like it, but boy, did they nail the messaging on this.

06:15.760 --> 06:17.400
So instead of coming out and being like,

06:17.400 --> 06:19.160
yeah, not only do we have a vulnerability,

06:19.160 --> 06:21.040
and not only are we shutting down Google+,

06:21.040 --> 06:23.800
and not only do we try to cover it all up,

06:23.800 --> 06:27.400
they take a totally different approach.

06:27.400 --> 06:30.620
Instead, they launched Project Strobe,

06:30.620 --> 06:33.500
protecting your data, improving third party APIs,

06:33.500 --> 06:35.760
and sunsetting consumer Google+.

06:35.760 --> 06:40.040
So they announced this buzzword project, Project Strobe,

06:40.040 --> 06:42.680
that talks about auditing third party APIs

06:42.680 --> 06:45.680
and clamping down on Gmail access.

06:45.680 --> 06:48.820
And then, as almost to make their case,

06:48.820 --> 06:51.000
even though Google, up until this point,

06:51.000 --> 06:53.640
had claimed that it was a platform, Google+,

06:53.640 --> 06:55.800
they cared very, very deeply about,

06:55.800 --> 06:59.160
now they actually use its failure as an excuse to move on.

06:59.160 --> 07:00.920
They say the consumer version of Google+,

07:00.920 --> 07:03.680
currently has low usage and engagement.

07:03.680 --> 07:05.880
Get ready for this one.

07:05.880 --> 07:10.880
90% of Google+, user sessions are less than five seconds.

07:13.360 --> 07:15.840
That sounds like, oh, I clicked on a Google+, link,

07:15.840 --> 07:16.680
get out of here.

07:16.680 --> 07:18.760
That's exactly what it sounds like.

07:18.760 --> 07:21.320
So here's what was leaked, or potentially leaked.

07:21.320 --> 07:23.420
Here's what was capable of being leaked

07:23.420 --> 07:26.160
if third parties took advantage of this API flaw,

07:26.160 --> 07:29.320
which we don't know if that actually happened.

07:29.320 --> 07:30.720
It appears that the data is limited

07:30.720 --> 07:33.580
to static optional Google+, profile fields,

07:33.580 --> 07:35.220
which would include your name, email address,

07:35.220 --> 07:37.920
your occupation, your gender, and your age.

07:37.920 --> 07:40.400
It doesn't include other data from Google+,

07:40.400 --> 07:43.280
or other Google services, like your Gmail,

07:43.280 --> 07:45.260
or any G Suite content.

07:45.260 --> 07:46.500
They say when they discovered it,

07:46.500 --> 07:49.700
they believe that it was a result

07:49.700 --> 07:52.160
of subsequent Google+, code changes

07:52.160 --> 07:54.280
that caused interaction with the APIs

07:54.280 --> 07:56.040
that led this to be possible.

07:57.760 --> 07:59.000
So they probably just didn't have that many people

07:59.000 --> 08:01.120
doing very much good work on Google+, anymore,

08:01.120 --> 08:02.920
and some botched update.

08:02.920 --> 08:05.400
They mention that the review did highlight

08:05.400 --> 08:07.840
the significant challenges in creating and maintaining

08:07.840 --> 08:10.440
a successful Google+, that meets consumers' expectations,

08:10.440 --> 08:12.920
and given these challenges and the very low usage

08:12.920 --> 08:14.320
of the consumer version of Google+,

08:14.320 --> 08:17.760
we've decided to sunset the consumer version of Google+.

08:17.760 --> 08:19.040
Well, Chris, where are you going?

08:19.040 --> 08:20.680
What else is there?

08:20.680 --> 08:22.200
I stopped using Google+, a long time ago,

08:22.200 --> 08:23.800
but the reason why I wanted to include this on the show

08:23.800 --> 08:27.760
is the people I have noticed that are still using it

08:27.760 --> 08:29.600
are people from the open source community.

08:29.600 --> 08:30.720
There are people.

08:30.720 --> 08:33.400
That's all that's left, from what I can tell.

08:33.400 --> 08:38.400
It's photographers, Mike What's-His-Face,

08:38.480 --> 08:39.840
that used to be on Twitter.

08:39.840 --> 08:40.660
Elgin.

08:40.660 --> 08:43.400
Yeah, Elgin, Mike Elgin, and Alan Cox,

08:43.400 --> 08:44.440
and other open source users.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.000
Linus used to host there.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.840
That's who's left on Google+, right?

08:48.840 --> 08:51.640
Well, there's also a whole bunch of communities,

08:51.640 --> 08:54.520
innovative commerce communities, that they call.

08:54.520 --> 08:57.400
The Ubuntu one is one of the largest on Google+.

08:57.400 --> 09:00.280
It's got 288,000 people in it.

09:00.280 --> 09:02.040
It's pretty huge.

09:02.040 --> 09:04.720
Unfortunately, every post in there nowadays

09:04.720 --> 09:06.280
has a lot of spam in the comments,

09:06.280 --> 09:08.920
because Google clearly haven't cared enough

09:08.920 --> 09:10.200
to clear that stuff up.

09:10.200 --> 09:13.200
And if I go in there and have a look at the admin interface,

09:13.200 --> 09:15.800
it's just like constant spam all the time.

09:15.800 --> 09:18.000
It's been a really mixed message from the very beginning.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.800
They say they're going to implement this wind down

09:19.800 --> 09:22.480
over a 10-month period, slated for the completion

09:22.480 --> 09:24.520
by the end of next August.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.400
10 months is a weird timeframe.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.960
Looking at my G Plus feed today,

09:28.960 --> 09:32.960
it's full of people saying, you can now find me here.

09:32.960 --> 09:37.760
People choosing where they're going to go instead of G+.

09:37.760 --> 09:40.040
And a lot of times, it seems to be Mastodon.

09:40.040 --> 09:44.000
And Diaspora seems to be getting a little bit of resurgence

09:44.000 --> 09:45.200
here and there as well.

09:45.200 --> 09:47.200
I'd say the one I've seen the most actually is Twitter.

09:47.200 --> 09:49.520
But the second one I've seen the most is Mastodon.

09:49.520 --> 09:52.600
Seems to be a good moment for Mastodon.

09:52.600 --> 09:55.200
Now, if Mastodon steps up and produces something,

09:55.200 --> 09:56.720
or continues to produce something

09:56.720 --> 09:57.680
that people find compelling, they

09:57.680 --> 10:00.640
may have an opening now, although I've

10:00.640 --> 10:02.080
thought from the day they launched it,

10:02.080 --> 10:05.000
there just wasn't a lot of room for a third social network,

10:05.000 --> 10:06.560
at least not here in the States.

10:06.560 --> 10:09.760
The States is a Coke and Pepsi country, right left.

10:09.760 --> 10:11.920
We seem to get two brands, and then we're good.

10:11.920 --> 10:12.920
We got Twitter and Facebook.

10:12.920 --> 10:14.320
Three is confusing, Preston.

10:14.320 --> 10:16.200
Then you got the Instagrams, and you got the WhatsApp.

10:16.200 --> 10:17.120
It's just too much.

10:17.120 --> 10:19.360
There was no room for Google+, and it's silly circles.

10:19.360 --> 10:21.280
There just wasn't any room for it.

10:21.280 --> 10:23.480
That's why they had to cram it into YouTube

10:23.480 --> 10:24.520
to try to force usage.

10:24.520 --> 10:27.480
But that didn't really work out too well either.

10:27.480 --> 10:28.800
You know, the real tell there was

10:28.800 --> 10:32.200
that Google's own executives stopped posting to Google+,

10:32.200 --> 10:34.920
and started posting to Twitter about three years ago.

10:34.920 --> 10:37.640
Seriously, as soon as I noticed that, I'm like, ah.

10:37.640 --> 10:38.400
They don't believe it.

10:38.400 --> 10:39.000
Not dog food.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Yeah, yeah, that's not good.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.720
But as much as I seem flippant about it,

10:44.720 --> 10:46.960
for those of you who got value out of it,

10:46.960 --> 10:49.400
which is probably someone in our audience,

10:49.400 --> 10:51.240
I'm sorry about your loss.

10:51.240 --> 10:54.280
It's just one of those dangers of these closed services.

10:54.280 --> 10:56.200
If this had happened two years ago,

10:56.200 --> 10:58.760
I would have been beside myself.

10:58.760 --> 11:02.320
But it's been waning for a while, and certainly

11:02.320 --> 11:04.920
since Mastodon sort of caught people's attention

11:04.920 --> 11:07.960
about a year ago, or people within the open source

11:07.960 --> 11:10.720
community about a year ago.

11:10.720 --> 11:12.720
It's very active over on Mastodon now,

11:12.720 --> 11:15.320
and I think that I've been posting there

11:15.320 --> 11:16.920
where I haven't been posting on G+.

11:16.920 --> 11:19.240
for a while now.

11:19.240 --> 11:23.440
I've resisted Mastodon just because I'm over.

11:23.440 --> 11:25.840
I don't particularly like social media.

11:25.840 --> 11:27.880
I like chatting with audience people,

11:27.880 --> 11:29.080
so that's why I'm on there.

11:29.080 --> 11:31.600
And I like tweeting back and forth with audience members.

11:31.600 --> 11:35.560
But the rest of the people that are on social media,

11:35.560 --> 11:38.440
I generally find them to be obnoxious.

11:38.440 --> 11:41.280
I don't know, I don't like any of it.

11:41.280 --> 11:43.360
I generally am not a big fan of group think.

11:43.360 --> 11:45.040
So when everybody starts freaking out

11:45.040 --> 11:47.000
about the same thing, I immediately kind of pull back

11:47.000 --> 11:48.280
and go, oh, what's going on here?

11:48.280 --> 11:49.360
And that's totally common.

11:49.360 --> 11:52.440
The mob mentality is super common on social media.

11:52.440 --> 11:53.720
And I'm not into it.

11:53.720 --> 11:54.560
It bums me out.

11:54.560 --> 11:56.120
So I've pulled back a lot.

11:56.120 --> 11:59.760
I mostly just go for the list that I have now on Twitter

11:59.760 --> 12:00.920
where I can follow my friends.

12:00.920 --> 12:04.440
And my ad replies, and so I can reply to audience members.

12:04.440 --> 12:07.920
Have you seen in England this week,

12:07.920 --> 12:10.000
there's been a program called The Circle?

12:10.000 --> 12:11.640
And my wife's been going crazy about it.

12:11.640 --> 12:15.520
It's a social media quote unquote experiment

12:15.520 --> 12:18.280
where they take, it's like Big Brother sort of,

12:18.280 --> 12:21.560
where they lock some people up in an apartment complex,

12:21.560 --> 12:25.600
and they use nothing but social media to communicate.

12:25.600 --> 12:26.640
It's really fascinating.

12:26.640 --> 12:28.880
They've had men pretending to be girls,

12:28.880 --> 12:30.840
and girls pretending to be men, and straight people

12:30.840 --> 12:32.760
pretending to be gay, and vice versa.

12:32.760 --> 12:35.760
And it's really interesting to watch

12:35.760 --> 12:38.360
how the different factions within that group communicate.

12:38.360 --> 12:41.400
And like what you said, people do,

12:41.400 --> 12:44.120
they're very quick to pick up the pitchfork and form a mob.

12:44.120 --> 12:49.080
And it shows how when a lot of them,

12:49.080 --> 12:50.600
one of the comments someone said was,

12:50.600 --> 12:52.520
it's easy to forget that there's someone,

12:52.520 --> 12:55.000
an actual person behind the screen

12:55.000 --> 12:57.400
when you get on that keyboard.

12:57.400 --> 12:58.800
Yeah, and I think we see that all the time

12:58.800 --> 13:00.800
in YouTube comments, in Reddit comments,

13:00.800 --> 13:03.000
in some of the dross that's on the internet.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.800
And I think things like Google Plus and Facebook

13:05.800 --> 13:09.120
and whatever, because they were real people,

13:09.120 --> 13:14.080
they had somewhat of a slightly less crappy

13:14.080 --> 13:15.880
signal to noise ratio, but.

13:15.880 --> 13:17.840
They were kind of one of the loudest voices

13:17.840 --> 13:21.720
on use your real name, use a profile picture.

13:21.720 --> 13:25.960
And that was kind of one of the bigger things they pushed.

13:25.960 --> 13:29.240
Just in terms of online discourse,

13:29.240 --> 13:31.240
I, over the years of doing these shows,

13:31.240 --> 13:35.240
have gotten many, very, very upset emails or comments.

13:35.240 --> 13:40.760
And if I respond in kind, and I go in all guns blazing,

13:40.760 --> 13:42.840
then usually it just derails.

13:42.840 --> 13:45.240
But if I respond to them in a calm, rational way,

13:45.240 --> 13:47.580
I have to be in the right place emotionally to do that.

13:47.580 --> 13:50.760
But if I respond in sort of a calm, rational way,

13:50.760 --> 13:54.240
really, my experience shows me nine times out of 10,

13:54.240 --> 13:55.880
I get an email back that goes, oh, man,

13:55.880 --> 13:57.360
I was just having a bad day.

13:57.360 --> 13:58.480
I didn't even really think about the fact

13:58.480 --> 14:00.120
that you're a real person, too.

14:00.120 --> 14:02.840
I just was super upset about stuff.

14:02.840 --> 14:05.280
I've gotten so many of those emails.

14:05.280 --> 14:09.200
And I've been getting those since before Twitter even

14:09.200 --> 14:12.100
existed, when Twitter was a podcast app that was called

14:12.100 --> 14:13.640
something completely different.

14:13.640 --> 14:17.020
And my point is when I use these social media networks,

14:17.020 --> 14:20.040
I see that same disconnect that I have had interactions with

14:20.040 --> 14:22.160
over email and now other mediums,

14:22.160 --> 14:25.600
where people are not really wired up to fully

14:25.600 --> 14:27.840
contextually communicate this way.

14:27.840 --> 14:30.140
And it's another reason why we often come on the show

14:30.140 --> 14:33.360
and say, if you can even just once a year

14:33.360 --> 14:38.040
go to a open source style Linux style community event

14:38.040 --> 14:39.560
and meet some of the people that you

14:39.560 --> 14:41.520
talk to over the internet in person,

14:41.520 --> 14:45.200
it will change that relationship.

14:45.200 --> 14:48.400
And the reason for it is I think that the meat sack that

14:48.400 --> 14:52.680
sits between our ears is a little more

14:52.680 --> 14:54.560
tuned to those types of interactions

14:54.560 --> 14:57.280
where it can get body language context

14:57.280 --> 15:02.200
and the tone of your voice and the context of the conversation

15:02.200 --> 15:05.000
and all of those nuances that help

15:05.000 --> 15:08.160
you make an informed decision about what the person is saying.

15:08.160 --> 15:10.480
And when it's all over text, we project a little bit.

15:10.480 --> 15:12.200
We read intention into it.

15:12.200 --> 15:13.600
We think, are they mad at us?

15:13.600 --> 15:15.120
Did I do something wrong?

15:15.120 --> 15:18.040
I made this mistake where I sent somebody

15:18.040 --> 15:20.680
a file via Slack on Sunday.

15:20.680 --> 15:24.080
And it was a co-worker who is down in Texas.

15:24.080 --> 15:26.960
And she doesn't work seven days a week like I do.

15:26.960 --> 15:29.320
So for her, she's getting these messages on a Sunday.

15:29.320 --> 15:31.480
And she's like, OK, thanks, dot, dot, dot.

15:31.480 --> 15:32.600
And that was all she sent.

15:32.600 --> 15:35.940
I'm like, oh, man, did I piss her off?

15:35.940 --> 15:38.160
I probably made her phone buzz on a Sunday afternoon.

15:38.160 --> 15:39.560
It's evening down there.

15:39.560 --> 15:42.320
And I start feeling like all these waves of guilt.

15:42.320 --> 15:44.480
And I even thought about writing her apology Monday morning.

15:44.480 --> 15:46.360
I thought about writing her apology right then.

15:46.360 --> 15:48.080
But then I thought, no, that'll just send her more messages.

15:48.080 --> 15:48.920
I shouldn't do that.

15:48.920 --> 15:50.200
That'll upset her more.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.680
I'll wait till Monday morning.

15:51.680 --> 15:53.640
And I'll write her an apology on Monday morning saying,

15:53.640 --> 15:55.680
sorry, I didn't think about your phone might beep

15:55.680 --> 15:57.320
when I sent you a Slack.

15:57.320 --> 15:59.420
All this is going on in my head within 30 seconds

15:59.420 --> 16:00.000
of sending her that.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.240
Well, it could be nothing, right?

16:01.240 --> 16:02.560
It could be just she should have sent.

16:02.560 --> 16:03.720
She might have meant thanks.

16:03.720 --> 16:04.920
Right, yep.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.640
I mean, I guess it's not surprising.

16:06.640 --> 16:08.800
It is a new form of communication.

16:08.800 --> 16:11.680
So maybe it isn't weird that we are struggling with it.

16:11.680 --> 16:14.040
Because we're still trying to figure out the guardrails

16:14.040 --> 16:14.960
and how to make it work.

16:14.960 --> 16:15.560
Yeah.

16:15.560 --> 16:18.160
So that's why I think it is very true

16:18.160 --> 16:20.680
that the context in this kind of stuff really matters.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.520
All right, well, let's shift gears now

16:22.520 --> 16:24.360
and go from the heady community stuff.

16:24.360 --> 16:27.560
And let's move into, and I guess one more thing to that,

16:27.560 --> 16:29.200
is I think that's why things like Mumble

16:29.200 --> 16:31.800
stick around, because people get more context in voice chat

16:31.800 --> 16:32.160
and stuff like that.

16:32.160 --> 16:34.440
OK, so let's move into some new Plasma features.

16:34.440 --> 16:35.680
Yeah, the good news of the show.

16:35.680 --> 16:39.480
Plasma 5.14 landed this morning.

16:39.480 --> 16:41.600
And I've already updated my neon boxes.

16:41.600 --> 16:44.200
It's got a couple of great new features.

16:44.200 --> 16:45.800
I'll just mention a couple, because I know not everybody

16:45.800 --> 16:46.400
out there cares.

16:46.400 --> 16:48.440
But for those of us who follow this stuff,

16:48.440 --> 16:50.080
there's a new display configuration widget

16:50.080 --> 16:51.760
for screen management, which is nice.

16:51.760 --> 16:55.640
You plug in an external display, a little widget

16:55.640 --> 16:57.480
comes up by your system tray and says,

16:57.480 --> 16:58.960
is there just a quick screen layout?

16:58.960 --> 17:01.000
Do you want to go into presentation mode, which

17:01.000 --> 17:02.240
I think is pretty neat?

17:02.240 --> 17:06.000
Presentation mode will turn your power management settings

17:06.000 --> 17:08.240
so that your computer and screen do not turn off

17:08.240 --> 17:10.040
during your presentation.

17:10.040 --> 17:13.320
And then it can enforce, in certain conditions,

17:13.320 --> 17:15.680
presentation mode over applications, like Chrome.

17:15.680 --> 17:16.640
Pretty nice.

17:16.640 --> 17:19.360
And the audio volume widget now has a built-in speaker test

17:19.360 --> 17:21.800
feature, which I can tell you how useful that could be.

17:21.800 --> 17:24.040
Oh, yeah.

17:24.040 --> 17:26.320
And thankfully, the network widget now

17:26.320 --> 17:29.560
works again with SSH VPN tunnels, which is slick.

17:29.560 --> 17:30.080
Right there.

17:30.080 --> 17:31.440
It's one of those things that you don't think about

17:31.440 --> 17:32.200
until you have one.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.120
And you're like, why is this not showing up?

17:34.120 --> 17:36.280
I am so thankful that it's so easy to do standard,

17:36.280 --> 17:38.200
like PPTP VPNs and things like that.

17:38.200 --> 17:40.360
So getting an SSH tunnel is going to be great.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.120
And then just, what was it?

17:42.120 --> 17:44.680
One or two episodes ago, we were talking about Discover,

17:44.680 --> 17:47.640
getting FW update support.

17:47.640 --> 17:50.480
So now, if you're on the Plasma 5.14

17:50.480 --> 17:52.800
and you use the Discover Software Manager,

17:52.800 --> 17:56.680
you'll also be plugged into LVFS and get firmware updates

17:56.680 --> 17:57.800
for your rig.

17:57.800 --> 18:01.360
And it gains support for snap channels, which,

18:01.360 --> 18:04.360
if I am correct, is that, maybe Poppy wouldn't be correct me,

18:04.360 --> 18:07.120
is that different types of the beta channel

18:07.120 --> 18:08.760
versus the stable channel of a snap?

18:08.760 --> 18:09.120
Right.

18:09.120 --> 18:10.040
Very cool.

18:10.040 --> 18:12.360
Yeah, this was a conversation we had when I was back

18:12.360 --> 18:15.360
at Academy a few weeks ago.

18:15.360 --> 18:19.120
Alesh is one of the KDE Discover maintainers.

18:19.120 --> 18:22.000
And yeah, one of the most desired features

18:22.000 --> 18:24.120
was the capability for people to switch channel

18:24.120 --> 18:25.000
from within the GUI.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.920
So they don't have to use a command line like a barbarian,

18:27.920 --> 18:30.280
but switch channels directly in the user interface.

18:30.280 --> 18:32.680
And they've implemented that in the few weeks

18:32.680 --> 18:36.240
since I was in Vienna, which is really good to see.

18:36.240 --> 18:36.800
No kidding.

18:36.800 --> 18:38.360
Talk about some quick turnaround.

18:38.360 --> 18:40.400
Also, some improved support for Flatpak.

18:40.400 --> 18:43.200
If you try to install a standalone Flatpak file,

18:43.200 --> 18:45.760
but the whole Flatpak back end hasn't been installed,

18:45.760 --> 18:47.360
it'll now ask, hey, hey, genius, do

18:47.360 --> 18:49.480
you want me to install the Flatpak support for you?

18:49.480 --> 18:50.800
Very nice.

18:50.800 --> 18:53.920
And then K-Wind, continuing its march

18:53.920 --> 18:55.920
towards excellent Wayland support,

18:55.920 --> 18:59.720
there is a fix in there to correct copy and paste

18:59.720 --> 19:01.840
between GTK applications.

19:01.840 --> 19:02.360
Oh, good.

19:02.360 --> 19:03.400
I'm so glad to see that.

19:03.400 --> 19:07.440
Yeah, because say you had GEdit open

19:07.440 --> 19:11.560
and you wanted a copy between GEdit and K-Write,

19:11.560 --> 19:12.760
you couldn't do it before on Wayland.

19:12.760 --> 19:14.200
So that's been solved now.

19:14.200 --> 19:16.000
And they considerably improved and polished

19:16.000 --> 19:18.520
K-Wind effects throughout, including a completely rewritten

19:18.520 --> 19:22.960
dim inactive effect, which is a neat effect you can set in K-Wind

19:22.960 --> 19:25.160
when a window goes inactive.

19:25.160 --> 19:26.920
So you get three or four windows up.

19:26.920 --> 19:28.760
Only the active window is lit up.

19:28.760 --> 19:30.880
The other ones can have a dim effect.

19:30.880 --> 19:32.560
They can even blur a little bit.

19:32.560 --> 19:34.520
They can go translucent.

19:34.520 --> 19:37.680
And this is kind of a neat way to help your eye

19:37.680 --> 19:38.800
cut through visual clutter.

19:38.800 --> 19:40.400
So you need a couple of windows up on your screen.

19:40.400 --> 19:42.560
Maybe you arrange things like on the OBS machine,

19:42.560 --> 19:45.320
I've got three windows open right now.

19:45.320 --> 19:47.040
It's pretty easy to tell which one's active,

19:47.040 --> 19:51.160
because the Close and Minimize buttons are lit up.

19:51.160 --> 19:52.720
And so that's how I can quickly tell

19:52.720 --> 19:54.120
which is the active window.

19:54.120 --> 19:58.320
However, if you wanted a more dramatic visual cue,

19:58.320 --> 20:00.680
you could have it so that the only application that

20:00.680 --> 20:04.160
was its regular lit state was the active applications.

20:04.160 --> 20:06.800
And all of the other windows would take a slight dim effect.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.560
And that's been totally rewritten

20:08.560 --> 20:11.400
in this version of Plasma, including a new scale effect

20:11.400 --> 20:14.040
and rewriting the glide effect when windows glide around

20:14.040 --> 20:14.640
on the screen.

20:14.640 --> 20:16.080
Just lots of little polish.

20:16.080 --> 20:16.880
Love it, man.

20:16.880 --> 20:18.440
I just am so happy with it.

20:18.440 --> 20:20.720
And rockin' the Neon 1804.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.480
And the updates came down this morning.

20:22.480 --> 20:23.040
It's been.

20:23.040 --> 20:25.040
I know what I'll be installing tonight.

20:25.040 --> 20:26.880
And I notice like almost every day now,

20:26.880 --> 20:31.000
there's some thread in our Linux or on some blog post

20:31.000 --> 20:33.760
about somebody's just discovered Plasma.

20:33.760 --> 20:34.640
The popularity's real.

20:34.640 --> 20:37.360
It's not just us.

20:37.360 --> 20:39.440
OK, nobody has anything to add to that.

20:39.440 --> 20:41.560
Then let's change gears to.

20:41.560 --> 20:42.320
I do.

20:42.320 --> 20:43.480
I love KDE.

20:43.480 --> 20:44.840
You know I do.

20:44.840 --> 20:46.680
I say it every week.

20:46.680 --> 20:47.280
Yeah, yeah.

20:47.280 --> 20:47.800
And let's do it.

20:47.800 --> 20:49.560
OK, well then, if Alex is going to chime in,

20:49.560 --> 20:52.880
then we have to check in on Popy and Popy's laptop

20:52.880 --> 20:56.120
that was installed in the air running Neon at the time.

20:56.120 --> 20:59.000
Is that installation still standing, Mr. Popy?

20:59.000 --> 21:01.480
That's the same installation, the one that I upgraded

21:01.480 --> 21:03.720
to 1804 just last week, yes.

21:03.720 --> 21:04.440
Boom.

21:04.440 --> 21:05.520
Still stands.

21:05.520 --> 21:09.800
All right, ladies and gentlemen, that is your Popy Neon laptop

21:09.800 --> 21:10.300
update.

21:10.300 --> 21:11.600
We need a jingle right there.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.840
All right, now shifting gears to GNOME.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.520
There's going to be some changes coming down the road,

21:16.520 --> 21:19.560
probably in GNOME 3.32.

21:19.560 --> 21:21.920
The application menus, or the app menus

21:21.920 --> 21:24.020
as they're often called, are the menus

21:24.020 --> 21:26.780
that you see up in the GNOME 3 top bar with the name

21:26.780 --> 21:29.880
and the icon for the current app.

21:29.880 --> 21:32.840
Well, these menus have been with us since the very, very

21:32.840 --> 21:35.120
beginning of GNOME.

21:35.120 --> 21:38.560
And they're going to be retired in the next released version

21:38.560 --> 21:41.520
of GNOME, GNOME 3.2.

21:41.520 --> 21:46.240
So no more app menus up in the top menu bar of GNOME Shell.

21:46.240 --> 21:48.140
The applications themselves that have menus,

21:48.140 --> 21:50.680
like when you hold down Alt for file and edit,

21:50.680 --> 21:51.800
those can remain.

21:51.800 --> 21:54.560
But the ones up in the Shell bar are going away.

21:54.560 --> 21:57.680
One little area you could click that was never

21:57.680 --> 21:58.600
used very much anyway?

21:58.600 --> 22:01.760
Sometimes had quitter preferences in there.

22:01.760 --> 22:05.040
They feel, and this is from Alan Day's blog post.

22:05.040 --> 22:07.320
He writes, when the app menus were first introduced,

22:07.320 --> 22:10.200
they were intended to play two main roles.

22:10.200 --> 22:12.800
First, they were supposed to contain application level menu

22:12.800 --> 22:14.360
items, like preferences about and quit.

22:14.360 --> 22:18.040
Secondly, they were supposed to indicate which app was focused.

22:18.040 --> 22:20.640
Unfortunately, we've seen app menus not performing well

22:20.640 --> 22:22.920
over the years despite an effort to improve them.

22:22.920 --> 22:24.640
People don't always engage with them.

22:24.640 --> 22:27.760
Often, they haven't realized that the menus are interactive

22:27.760 --> 22:31.480
or even remembered that they are there.

22:31.480 --> 22:33.320
I'm not too surprised by that.

22:33.320 --> 22:34.840
I'm guilty of that myself.

22:34.840 --> 22:37.560
Now, he writes, we're planning on removing application menus

22:37.560 --> 22:40.800
from GNOME in time for the next release, version 3.32.

22:40.800 --> 22:44.480
The application menus will no longer be shown in the top bar.

22:44.480 --> 22:47.360
Each GNOME application will move the items from its app menu

22:47.360 --> 22:50.720
to the menu inside the application window.

22:50.720 --> 22:53.560
If an application, read most of them,

22:53.560 --> 22:57.400
if an application fails to remove its app menu by 3.32,

22:57.400 --> 22:59.920
it will be shown in the app's header bar

22:59.920 --> 23:02.960
using the fallback UI that is already provided by GTK.

23:02.960 --> 23:04.720
This means there's no danger of menu items

23:04.720 --> 23:08.240
not being accessible if the app fails to migrate in time.

23:08.240 --> 23:10.160
I think I'd love to hear Wimpy's take on this,

23:10.160 --> 23:13.480
just because he's our number one Ubuntu Mate guy right here.

23:13.480 --> 23:14.520
Boom, right there.

23:14.520 --> 23:17.880
And Ubuntu Mate is kind of around because a lot of people

23:17.880 --> 23:20.120
don't like the changes in GNOME.

23:20.120 --> 23:22.160
I wasn't sure how far I could take that.

23:22.160 --> 23:24.920
So Wimpy, what are your thoughts on these kinds of changes?

23:24.920 --> 23:27.040
My first thought, and I'll let you take it from there,

23:27.040 --> 23:30.200
was I wonder if there was a discussion about how

23:30.200 --> 23:33.120
to improve them and make them more useful,

23:33.120 --> 23:34.960
or if the conversation immediately went,

23:34.960 --> 23:36.160
let's remove them.

23:36.160 --> 23:40.080
Who can say I wasn't part of those conversations?

23:40.080 --> 23:44.640
Obviously, GNOME have their own design direction,

23:44.640 --> 23:49.560
and they've iterated on that over many years now.

23:49.560 --> 23:54.280
And they've also not been frightened

23:54.280 --> 23:59.680
of going back from a decision they've made previously.

23:59.680 --> 24:04.840
So I think we should let them do the things the way they want

24:04.840 --> 24:09.960
to do it, because if GNOME isn't a desktop interface

24:09.960 --> 24:13.080
workflow that you are comfortable with or like,

24:13.080 --> 24:14.760
then good news.

24:14.760 --> 24:17.880
Linux has got plenty of other desktop environments

24:17.880 --> 24:19.360
to choose from, and I'm sure there's

24:19.360 --> 24:23.680
one out there that will suit you more appropriately.

24:23.680 --> 24:26.840
Hmm, hmm, I'm reading between lines there a little bit.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.600
Not really.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.320
Honestly, from my point of view, I

24:30.320 --> 24:34.720
don't actually care what GNOME decide to do or don't do.

24:34.720 --> 24:35.700
It's their project.

24:35.700 --> 24:38.040
It's down to them and their designers

24:38.040 --> 24:41.800
to set the direction that they want to go in.

24:41.800 --> 24:44.240
And if some people love that stuff

24:44.240 --> 24:46.120
and it draws people to GNOME, then great.

24:46.120 --> 24:49.400
And if some people don't like it and it pushes people

24:49.400 --> 24:52.520
towards KDE or Marte or something else,

24:52.520 --> 24:54.640
then that's fine too.

24:54.640 --> 24:57.280
There's still plenty of well-supported desktop

24:57.280 --> 24:59.800
environments out there and all the major distributions.

24:59.800 --> 25:03.840
So yeah, just find one that suits you.

25:03.840 --> 25:05.200
OK, that does make sense.

25:05.200 --> 25:07.320
Now, here's what the counter-argument would be.

25:07.320 --> 25:09.720
The counter-argument would be, well, now Wimpy

25:09.720 --> 25:13.040
is shipping on all of the major distros by default

25:13.040 --> 25:15.280
and new users coming to Linux.

25:15.280 --> 25:19.800
Wimpy, this is what they're experiencing out of the box.

25:19.800 --> 25:23.820
And so we must defend this pretend user

25:23.820 --> 25:26.120
that we're making up in our heads for a straw man argument.

25:26.120 --> 25:27.240
No, they're not.

25:27.240 --> 25:29.880
New users aren't coming to GNOME 3.20.

25:29.880 --> 25:32.240
They're coming to Ubuntu 18.04.

25:32.240 --> 25:34.000
They're coming to Ubuntu 16.04.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.680
That's where those users are going.

25:35.680 --> 25:40.240
It's only the absolute lunatics who are using Arch

25:40.240 --> 25:44.840
or the tiny niche who are using Fedora or the Germans who

25:44.840 --> 25:48.160
are using SUSE who are getting these weird new versions

25:48.160 --> 25:48.760
of GNOME.

25:48.760 --> 25:51.440
Your average user is using Ubuntu 18.04,

25:51.440 --> 25:53.400
and they're using the user interface

25:53.400 --> 25:54.680
that you know and love today.

25:54.680 --> 25:56.680
Yeah, and I think really what you're saying there

25:56.680 --> 26:01.120
is that there is another layer of catch here,

26:01.120 --> 26:05.920
where if something was to radically change in GNOME,

26:05.920 --> 26:09.480
there's the distributions that still can have vendor patches

26:09.480 --> 26:12.440
that can apply to it to restore that functionality.

26:12.440 --> 26:13.640
And we get flack for that.

26:13.640 --> 26:16.080
People moan at us because we hold back

26:16.080 --> 26:18.080
versions of Nautilus or other things,

26:18.080 --> 26:20.720
because we have a large number of users who

26:20.720 --> 26:22.340
care about these things, and they tell us

26:22.340 --> 26:24.720
when stuff is objectionable.

26:24.720 --> 26:27.760
It's all very well designing something for the future,

26:27.760 --> 26:30.720
but we've got people right now who are using these systems,

26:30.720 --> 26:32.160
and they need to use a system that

26:32.160 --> 26:34.760
is familiar and intuitive and easy to use

26:34.760 --> 26:38.560
and all those other UX terms.

26:38.560 --> 26:40.960
We'll see what this looks like in 2004

26:40.960 --> 26:42.520
when the next LTS comes around.

26:42.520 --> 26:43.920
It's interesting.

26:43.920 --> 26:46.720
I often don't object personally to a lot of the changes

26:46.720 --> 26:50.000
GNOME makes, but it's strange to see a project that

26:50.000 --> 26:53.720
feels like a stable desktop that is changing so much

26:53.720 --> 26:54.820
and removing features.

26:54.820 --> 26:56.820
Most change I think that we see is a creative, right?

26:56.820 --> 26:59.120
We're like, oh, great, I got a new feature this week.

26:59.120 --> 27:00.520
That's really cool.

27:00.520 --> 27:01.880
GNOME does it differently.

27:01.880 --> 27:03.280
Yeah, it's simplifying, though.

27:03.280 --> 27:04.640
It can be a good thing.

27:04.640 --> 27:06.560
It can be an easier code base to maintain.

27:06.560 --> 27:09.760
It can make moving to new display technologies easier.

27:09.760 --> 27:14.720
It can make re-architecting your desktop shell easier.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.440
So there's reasons to do it.

27:16.440 --> 27:17.020
You're right.

27:17.020 --> 27:18.440
They're not doing it for the fun.

27:18.440 --> 27:21.440
They're not doing it because they want to annoy their users

27:21.440 --> 27:25.880
or they don't want their desktop to be pretty and usable.

27:25.880 --> 27:27.840
They're doing it because of perceived benefit

27:27.840 --> 27:29.400
to the user and the developer.

27:29.400 --> 27:33.720
So it makes total sense to do these things.

27:33.720 --> 27:35.480
It's just frustrating for users who

27:35.480 --> 27:38.080
have come to love icons on the desktop

27:38.080 --> 27:40.180
or menus in the menu bar or whatever

27:40.180 --> 27:41.840
it is that's being modified.

27:41.840 --> 27:44.560
It just frustrates users because we're all resistant to change.

27:44.560 --> 27:48.640
But you go back to what GTK2 and GNOME2 look like.

27:48.640 --> 27:50.440
I was going to say like five years ago,

27:50.440 --> 27:52.680
but I meant five minutes ago in Ubuntu Marte.

27:52.680 --> 27:54.400
But you looked at what it looked like.

27:54.400 --> 27:56.680
People have moved on, like some people have,

27:56.680 --> 27:57.640
and those who haven't.

27:57.640 --> 27:59.040
There are other alternatives for them.

27:59.040 --> 28:01.680
Well, why don't we go back in time a little bit?

28:01.680 --> 28:04.800
So you heard Popi there mention Nautilus.

28:04.800 --> 28:07.520
The history of Nautilus is fascinating.

28:07.520 --> 28:09.860
And I recently came across someone

28:09.860 --> 28:12.640
who had front and center experience with it

28:12.640 --> 28:14.880
in a completely unexpected environment

28:14.880 --> 28:16.120
in a book that's out now that I'll

28:16.120 --> 28:18.380
have linked to the Audible version of the show notes

28:18.380 --> 28:19.880
called Creative Selection.

28:19.880 --> 28:22.320
And it follows someone named Ken Koisita,

28:22.320 --> 28:24.080
I think is how you say his last name.

28:24.080 --> 28:26.340
And he is a software engineer who

28:26.340 --> 28:29.240
has been involved in the industry for a really long

28:29.240 --> 28:30.200
time.

28:30.200 --> 28:32.240
And he eventually wound up at Apple,

28:32.240 --> 28:35.160
and he created the keyboard for the iPhone and the iPad

28:35.160 --> 28:37.660
and the Safari web browser.

28:37.660 --> 28:40.680
And his story about trying to get Mozilla's source

28:40.680 --> 28:43.880
code for Firefox back in the day to build is great.

28:43.880 --> 28:46.680
How they discovered Conqueror and then

28:46.680 --> 28:47.760
decided to go with WebKit.

28:47.760 --> 28:50.400
Like that whole story is in this book, and it's fascinating.

28:50.400 --> 28:52.400
But before you get there, there's

28:52.400 --> 28:55.880
a little history lesson about a small little company

28:55.880 --> 28:59.700
that you may have heard of before named Easel.

28:59.700 --> 29:03.360
Easel was founded by Andy Hertzfeld, who's also

29:03.360 --> 29:07.560
an Apple alumnus, in 1999 in a little town called Mountain

29:07.560 --> 29:08.800
View, California.

29:08.800 --> 29:11.580
It had 22 employees and had managed

29:11.580 --> 29:15.040
to raise about $12 million.

29:15.040 --> 29:17.380
That's not bad for a small crew.

29:17.380 --> 29:21.200
And in Ken's book, he goes into some of those early days

29:21.200 --> 29:22.400
at Easel.

29:22.400 --> 29:24.360
Before coming to Apple, I had a job

29:24.360 --> 29:26.600
at a startup called Easel.

29:26.600 --> 29:29.800
Our goal was to create an easy-to-use Linux system

29:29.800 --> 29:33.000
suitable for everyday computing, a free software

29:33.000 --> 29:37.220
alternative to Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows.

29:37.220 --> 29:39.160
The company was led by programmers

29:39.160 --> 29:42.760
who worked on the original Macintosh in the 1980s,

29:42.760 --> 29:44.840
including Bud Tribble, the first software

29:44.840 --> 29:49.160
manager for the Mac, and Andy Hertzfeld, the software wizard

29:49.160 --> 29:51.660
whose graphical user interface code helped

29:51.660 --> 29:55.000
to set the Mac apart from the text-mode personal computers

29:55.000 --> 29:57.440
that were the norm of the time.

29:57.440 --> 30:00.360
These fellows were my heroes, and I joined the company

30:00.360 --> 30:01.980
to work with them.

30:01.980 --> 30:04.840
The elegance and simplicity of their Mac software

30:04.840 --> 30:07.000
was my main inspiration for wanting

30:07.000 --> 30:09.400
to become a programmer.

30:09.400 --> 30:11.760
The inspiration for Easel came from Andy,

30:11.760 --> 30:13.460
and his vision for the company was

30:13.460 --> 30:17.000
fueled by the free software movement Andy identified

30:17.000 --> 30:20.380
with Stallman's idealism and by the concept of developing

30:20.380 --> 30:22.840
a file and icon manager that would make

30:22.840 --> 30:26.160
Linux a fitting competitor to Windows and the Mac,

30:26.160 --> 30:28.480
its more established rivals.

30:28.480 --> 30:30.240
So their core product was really going

30:30.240 --> 30:34.600
to be based around what we call today GNOME Files.

30:34.600 --> 30:37.520
But GNOME Files is based off something that we all

30:37.520 --> 30:39.520
refer to as Nautilus.

30:39.520 --> 30:41.560
Andy called this program Nautilus,

30:41.560 --> 30:45.280
and it would help Easel users find files, read email,

30:45.280 --> 30:48.520
launch programs like word processors and spreadsheets,

30:48.520 --> 30:50.720
and perhaps do cool new things like keeping

30:50.720 --> 30:53.280
track of a few digital photos.

30:53.280 --> 30:56.680
Easel contributed Nautilus to the GNOME Project,

30:56.680 --> 30:59.560
a loosely confederated free software community whose

30:59.560 --> 31:02.200
members, both individuals and companies,

31:02.200 --> 31:04.720
would be providing the rest of the software

31:04.720 --> 31:08.880
for the desktop computing system we were trying to build.

31:08.880 --> 31:11.260
To be a part of GNOME, Nautilus had

31:11.260 --> 31:13.680
to be licensed under the GPL.

31:13.680 --> 31:16.240
This had important implications for Easel

31:16.240 --> 31:19.600
as a commercial entity. Since people would be able to download

31:19.600 --> 31:21.960
Nautilus for free once we finished it,

31:21.960 --> 31:25.520
the company had to figure out some other way to make money.

31:25.520 --> 31:29.240
Not surprisingly, this involved creating proprietary software

31:29.240 --> 31:31.840
that Easel could charge people to use,

31:31.840 --> 31:35.160
a set of proto-cloud services including automatic software

31:35.160 --> 31:38.600
updates and online file storage.

31:38.600 --> 31:41.680
These cloud services would live in an Easel data center

31:41.680 --> 31:43.360
and would not be free.

31:43.360 --> 31:46.800
The idea was to integrate Nautilus with these services

31:46.800 --> 31:49.920
and position our no-cost software as a lure

31:49.920 --> 31:53.440
to draw people to Easel's pay-to-use features.

31:53.440 --> 31:56.520
The combination of dot-com fervor, enthusiasm

31:56.520 --> 32:00.680
over Linux and free software, abundant venture capital money,

32:00.680 --> 32:02.680
and our founder's connection to the Mac

32:02.680 --> 32:06.720
made it seem to me that Easel might just be the next big thing.

32:06.720 --> 32:09.220
So you have to put yourself in the mindset of the time.

32:09.220 --> 32:12.320
This is the late 90s, early 2000s.

32:12.320 --> 32:14.080
Linux is powering the dot-com boom.

32:14.080 --> 32:17.880
And the hype around Linux on the desktop was really strong.

32:17.880 --> 32:21.000
And it was where that joke originated.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
It's the year of the Linux desktop.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.200
That's where this comes from.

32:24.200 --> 32:25.320
And that's why, as it goes on, it

32:25.320 --> 32:26.840
gets to be even more of a joke.

32:26.840 --> 32:28.440
You were doing some searching, though, during the clip,

32:28.440 --> 32:30.200
and you can still find references

32:30.200 --> 32:32.440
to Easel in gnome file source code?

32:32.440 --> 32:35.000
Yeah, Wimpy pointed it out, but it's all over there.

32:35.000 --> 32:35.600
Yeah.

32:35.600 --> 32:36.840
Yeah, it's pretty fascinating.

32:36.840 --> 32:38.400
And so they were like, we can't lose.

32:38.400 --> 32:40.900
We've got this cool new, what he refers to in the book

32:40.900 --> 32:43.200
as proto-cloud services that we didn't call it the cloud

32:43.200 --> 32:44.040
back then.

32:44.040 --> 32:45.360
It was just online storage.

32:45.360 --> 32:46.780
It was a better day, that's for sure.

32:46.780 --> 32:47.280
Yeah.

32:47.280 --> 32:50.360
And they had some other really cool update management

32:50.360 --> 32:51.200
software.

32:51.200 --> 32:53.440
And they thought, OK, this is going to be it.

32:53.440 --> 32:54.600
We'll create this software.

32:54.600 --> 32:57.680
People can manage the updates across multiple Linux boxes.

32:57.680 --> 32:59.040
When they run out of file storage,

32:59.040 --> 33:01.280
they can save to our cloud storage.

33:01.280 --> 33:03.520
They didn't call it that, which we'll have integrated in

33:03.520 --> 33:04.900
with the file manager.

33:04.900 --> 33:06.560
And it's just going to be great.

33:06.560 --> 33:08.320
There was just a few problems.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.600
Number one, people didn't have that great of bandwidth.

33:10.600 --> 33:14.360
Number two, they fumbled the opportunity.

33:14.360 --> 33:17.680
But if indeed we had this chance, we fumbled it.

33:17.680 --> 33:20.880
We never lived up to any of our lofty goals.

33:20.880 --> 33:23.080
Chief among our missteps was failing

33:23.080 --> 33:27.040
to conceive of our software as a single product instead of

33:27.040 --> 33:29.320
as a set of separate projects.

33:29.320 --> 33:32.200
We never figured out how to integrate the pieces.

33:32.200 --> 33:34.160
Nothing worked smoothly.

33:34.160 --> 33:36.400
Our software update feature was riddled

33:36.400 --> 33:38.600
with bugs that often broke programs

33:38.600 --> 33:40.520
while trying to update them.

33:40.520 --> 33:43.680
Our code to connect Nautilus to our cloud services

33:43.680 --> 33:45.140
didn't work at all.

33:45.140 --> 33:47.760
The Nautilus team had persistent problems

33:47.760 --> 33:49.560
coordinating with GNOME.

33:49.560 --> 33:51.920
The loose structure and lack of profit motive

33:51.920 --> 33:53.520
of the free software community meant

33:53.520 --> 33:56.940
that they did not share our money-making goals

33:56.940 --> 33:58.560
or care to coordinate with us

33:58.560 --> 34:00.800
so that we could meet our delivery schedules.

34:00.800 --> 34:04.880
All these setbacks caused delay after delay.

34:04.880 --> 34:08.160
Yeah, and things didn't go too well.

34:08.160 --> 34:11.240
After Easel launched Nautilus 1.0,

34:11.240 --> 34:16.240
the company then laid off 40 of its 70-member staff,

34:16.320 --> 34:19.400
and then things kind of spun down from there.

34:19.400 --> 34:22.640
The company didn't really manage to pull it out.

34:22.640 --> 34:24.760
Despite even getting a substantial investment

34:24.760 --> 34:27.440
from Dell in December of 2000,

34:27.440 --> 34:29.240
the company failed to successfully monetize

34:29.240 --> 34:33.720
or secure more funding before their venture capital ran out.

34:33.720 --> 34:37.760
And things had changed a lot in that dot-com boom bust time.

34:37.760 --> 34:42.240
By March of 2001, things just were different,

34:42.240 --> 34:45.300
and the market was beginning to shift.

34:45.300 --> 34:48.440
But the sort of silver lining of all of this,

34:48.440 --> 34:50.040
not only did all of those folks go on

34:50.040 --> 34:52.160
to do bigger and better things,

34:52.160 --> 34:54.540
but we now get GNOME files,

34:54.540 --> 34:56.560
because the core software was GPL.

34:56.560 --> 34:58.360
And even though the company went bust,

34:58.360 --> 35:01.040
and the people that worked on it are now doing other things,

35:01.040 --> 35:04.760
here we are in 2018,

35:04.760 --> 35:08.760
still using stuff that was created in 1999,

35:08.760 --> 35:11.280
and has been refined and refined and refined over time.

35:11.280 --> 35:12.720
And it's been changed a lot,

35:13.800 --> 35:15.960
but it still has that heritage.

35:15.960 --> 35:18.560
And it was kind of ahead of its time in a lot of ways

35:18.560 --> 35:20.800
with its cloud storage solution.

35:20.800 --> 35:22.400
I remember Ubuntu had one too.

35:22.400 --> 35:24.760
Ubuntu 1.0 was originally gonna be a cloud storage

35:24.760 --> 35:26.320
and syncing solution.

35:26.320 --> 35:27.600
That was a big thing that people wanted

35:27.600 --> 35:29.300
to get into for a while.

35:29.300 --> 35:33.200
And it took really until Dropbox and that modern era

35:33.200 --> 35:34.960
to get things right.

35:34.960 --> 35:37.960
But that's, that GNOME files goes way back.

35:37.960 --> 35:40.520
It is neat that it's still around and it's still useful.

35:40.520 --> 35:42.100
It's not a bad file manager.

35:42.100 --> 35:43.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:43.800 --> 35:45.640
As long as you're using the Ubuntu version one,

35:45.640 --> 35:46.480
apparently, no.

35:46.480 --> 35:48.280
Hey-oh.

35:48.280 --> 35:49.600
All right, well, so there you go.

35:49.600 --> 35:50.840
There's a little GNOME history.

35:50.840 --> 35:52.720
If you have a project that you would think

35:52.720 --> 35:54.820
would make really good for us to go back into,

35:54.820 --> 35:57.040
especially if there's like some audio we could pull

35:57.040 --> 35:59.780
from a YouTube video or a book somewhere out there,

35:59.780 --> 36:00.700
let us know.

36:00.700 --> 36:03.520
Linuxunplug.com slash contact.

36:03.520 --> 36:07.800
That was a proto-segment, sort of like a version

36:07.800 --> 36:10.560
00.00001.

36:10.560 --> 36:11.640
Put it out at the wall, see what it was like.

36:11.640 --> 36:13.080
Yeah, we'd like to expand that later on

36:13.080 --> 36:14.120
and do something a little more

36:14.120 --> 36:16.340
and do projects that people are fascinated about

36:16.340 --> 36:18.140
that would apply to more than just GNOME users

36:18.140 --> 36:18.980
and things like that.

36:18.980 --> 36:20.080
So if you have a suggestion,

36:20.080 --> 36:23.300
Linuxunplug.com slash contact.

36:23.300 --> 36:24.220
And let me check.

36:24.220 --> 36:28.200
While I'm doing a little bit of admin work here,

36:28.200 --> 36:31.000
I'm gonna bring up the jobs page.

36:31.000 --> 36:35.860
It looks like there are still two AWS, oh, oh, no.

36:35.860 --> 36:37.340
Only one of each now, it appears.

36:37.340 --> 36:39.960
So there is an AWS training architect position

36:39.960 --> 36:41.580
open at Linux Academy,

36:41.580 --> 36:45.520
and there is a Microsoft Azure training architect position.

36:45.520 --> 36:48.400
Both are full-time with full benefits and all of that,

36:48.400 --> 36:49.680
and are remote.

36:49.680 --> 36:51.440
So I'm gonna put a link to that in the show notes.

36:51.440 --> 36:53.320
I gotta remember to do that right now.

36:53.320 --> 36:54.560
I'll put a link to this in the show notes

36:54.560 --> 36:55.800
if you would like to apply for those.

36:55.800 --> 36:58.880
They're also looking for a full-stack node developer,

36:59.920 --> 37:02.380
a Ruby developer, which is also remote,

37:02.380 --> 37:05.600
finance controller, there's several jobs actually open.

37:05.600 --> 37:07.680
Man, that Linux Academy, growing like cray-cray.

37:07.680 --> 37:08.640
Moving and shaking.

37:08.640 --> 37:09.560
Yeah, they are.

37:09.560 --> 37:14.560
So I will put a link to that right above the Stratus stuff.

37:15.080 --> 37:16.580
So if you're interested, go check that out.

37:16.580 --> 37:19.640
Linuxunplug.com slash 270.

37:19.640 --> 37:21.520
Figure we'll get the audience hooked up with the good stuff.

37:21.520 --> 37:22.700
You know what I'm saying?

37:22.700 --> 37:24.000
Looking up for the audience.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.520
All right, so let's move forward now.

37:25.520 --> 37:29.200
So we just looked back at known past.

37:29.200 --> 37:32.400
Well, let's look forward at Linux storage in the future.

37:32.400 --> 37:36.480
Now for a while, we've been talking about Project Stratus,

37:36.480 --> 37:38.840
which is an effort that's happening over at Red Hat

37:38.840 --> 37:41.000
to bring together various components

37:41.000 --> 37:44.720
of Linux's structured subsystems for storage.

37:44.720 --> 37:47.480
And there's several of them that exist already,

37:47.480 --> 37:50.720
including well-established file systems like XFS

37:50.720 --> 37:52.920
that I'm a huge fan of, LVM,

37:52.920 --> 37:55.200
which relies on a bunch of fundamental technologies

37:55.200 --> 37:56.760
that we're all pretty familiar with.

37:56.760 --> 37:58.900
Stratus is a new approach to constructing

37:58.900 --> 38:00.560
a volume managing file systems

38:00.560 --> 38:04.160
whose really its primary innovation

38:04.160 --> 38:05.200
that Stratus is bringing

38:05.200 --> 38:08.060
and what's gonna kind of make it come to market pretty fast

38:08.060 --> 38:12.360
is it's reusing existing Linux components.

38:12.360 --> 38:15.200
And it really has my interest piqued

38:15.200 --> 38:18.460
because A, it's based on XFS.

38:18.460 --> 38:19.300
Oh, you love it.

38:19.300 --> 38:20.120
You're already there.

38:20.120 --> 38:21.160
You're already there.

38:21.160 --> 38:26.160
And B, it's promising to try to drive feature-comparity

38:26.240 --> 38:29.560
with ZFS and ButterFS.

38:29.560 --> 38:30.500
It's pretty fascinating.

38:30.500 --> 38:34.120
And this last week, they hit version 1.0.

38:34.120 --> 38:34.960
The big 1.0.

38:34.960 --> 38:36.360
It's a major milestone, so we thought,

38:36.360 --> 38:39.320
well, let's bring one of the lead developers from Red Hat

38:39.320 --> 38:40.920
on the show to talk about it.

38:40.920 --> 38:43.000
We asked Andy Grover to join us.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.160
So joining us right now is Andy Grover,

38:45.160 --> 38:48.300
and he is a principal software engineer over at Red Hat,

38:48.300 --> 38:50.400
and he's been hacking away on Project Stratus.

38:50.400 --> 38:53.760
And I recently saw him blogging about 1.0.

38:53.760 --> 38:55.160
Had to get him on the show and talk about it.

38:55.160 --> 38:57.260
Andy, welcome to Linux Unplugged.

38:57.260 --> 38:58.100
Hey, Chris.

38:58.100 --> 38:58.920
Thanks a lot.

38:58.920 --> 38:59.760
Glad to be here.

38:59.760 --> 39:00.600
Hey, no, thank you very much.

39:00.600 --> 39:02.480
So for the folks that aren't familiar with it,

39:02.480 --> 39:05.340
give them the elevator pitch on what Project Stratus is.

39:05.340 --> 39:08.560
Well, I think we have a couple options

39:08.560 --> 39:12.520
for advanced storage features on Linux,

39:12.520 --> 39:15.280
but I don't think any of them, for various reasons,

39:15.280 --> 39:18.400
have really necessarily hit all the sweet spots.

39:18.400 --> 39:21.040
So I don't know if Stratus is gonna hit all the sweet spots,

39:21.040 --> 39:23.240
but I think it's gonna fill in.

39:23.240 --> 39:27.040
It really is meant to provide an easier way

39:27.040 --> 39:30.060
for people to manage their local storage

39:30.060 --> 39:33.560
so they don't have to worry about extending partitions

39:33.560 --> 39:35.960
or anything like that.

39:35.960 --> 39:39.740
It's just, it kind of does all those things for you,

39:39.740 --> 39:41.440
and so you just get the benefits

39:41.440 --> 39:43.560
of these advanced storage features.

39:44.460 --> 39:46.640
There's like ZFS and ButterFest.

39:46.640 --> 39:50.680
They have snapshots, and they have built-in,

39:50.680 --> 39:52.120
a lot of built-in features

39:52.120 --> 39:57.040
that we want to make easy to use for everybody.

39:57.040 --> 39:59.440
So that's kind of where we're trying to come from.

39:59.440 --> 40:02.040
What about some of the projects out there right now?

40:02.040 --> 40:03.480
I mean, ZFS, ButterFS,

40:03.480 --> 40:06.320
or even some of the up-and-coming things like BcashFS.

40:06.320 --> 40:09.280
What about those made them not really seem like a good fit?

40:09.280 --> 40:11.000
Why a new project?

40:11.000 --> 40:12.720
That's a great question.

40:12.720 --> 40:16.840
Well, I think coming as a Red Hat developer,

40:16.840 --> 40:21.840
I think ZFS is just, the licensing terms are a real problem

40:22.440 --> 40:25.640
for the powers that be to go with that.

40:25.640 --> 40:28.360
Not that other distros haven't said,

40:28.360 --> 40:30.120
hey, okay, we're gonna go for it,

40:30.120 --> 40:32.920
but I think Red Hat and Fedora,

40:33.960 --> 40:37.600
very conservative when it comes to patents, codecs,

40:37.600 --> 40:38.840
and the licensing.

40:38.840 --> 40:41.400
So that kind of ruled out ZFS as something

40:41.400 --> 40:43.760
that we could do.

40:43.760 --> 40:46.160
ButterFS, oh boy, ButterFS.

40:46.160 --> 40:50.440
Oh boy, I can't believe it's not ButterFS.

40:50.440 --> 40:51.640
Yeah, right?

40:51.640 --> 40:53.880
I mean, it was in tech preview in RHEL 7

40:53.880 --> 40:55.160
for a long time before it got pulled.

40:55.160 --> 40:57.040
I'm sure you talked a lot about that.

40:57.040 --> 41:02.040
So it just hasn't quite gotten there yet.

41:03.240 --> 41:06.320
I know some distros are shipping it,

41:06.320 --> 41:11.320
but even like Ubuntu, they're shipping ZFS.

41:11.320 --> 41:13.040
So I don't know.

41:13.040 --> 41:15.880
It's just like, it's not quite what we need it to be.

41:15.880 --> 41:18.240
It hasn't passed the test, the SNF test, essentially.

41:18.240 --> 41:21.000
It hasn't quite got enterprise grade stamped yet.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.500
Well, I don't wanna say that it's not right for some people,

41:23.500 --> 41:25.880
but it's just, it's not right for everybody, so.

41:25.880 --> 41:27.220
Yeah.

41:27.220 --> 41:28.060
So fair enough.

41:28.060 --> 41:30.880
So, but okay, so I think the core of the question is,

41:30.880 --> 41:35.880
is trying to fish out why not launch a 10-year project

41:37.240 --> 41:40.720
and build the next revolutionary file system for Linux?

41:40.720 --> 41:42.320
Why was that not the solution?

41:42.320 --> 41:45.240
Well, I think you kinda answered the question right there.

41:45.240 --> 41:47.580
Yeah, time is imperative in this.

41:47.580 --> 41:50.600
Do you feel like maybe Linux is a little behind,

41:50.600 --> 41:52.480
say, what ZFS is capable of,

41:52.480 --> 41:54.240
and so we needed a practical solution

41:54.240 --> 41:56.320
that was bolting together existing tech?

41:57.680 --> 42:00.060
I think that there were some,

42:00.060 --> 42:01.720
and this has happened before with Linux.

42:01.720 --> 42:05.560
I think we were behind early on in our USB support,

42:05.560 --> 42:08.120
and we kind of like, other OSes

42:08.120 --> 42:09.600
kind of highlight some deficiencies,

42:09.600 --> 42:12.040
and then we kind of like, rally and effort and catch up.

42:12.040 --> 42:14.760
So I think it, I think we're a little bit behind,

42:14.760 --> 42:19.760
and it's not that you can't do everything on Linux.

42:20.640 --> 42:24.640
It's just, you know, LVM, I mean, a lot,

42:24.640 --> 42:25.960
I think we'll talk about this more later.

42:25.960 --> 42:28.600
I mean, LVM and Stratus are both kind of leveraging

42:28.600 --> 42:31.600
the same core kernel capabilities,

42:31.600 --> 42:36.120
but LVM maybe isn't necessarily as easy as it could be to use

42:36.120 --> 42:38.080
and some of the other options aren't

42:38.080 --> 42:40.880
maybe an option either, so I think there's space

42:40.880 --> 42:45.460
for Stratus to come in and support these things

42:45.460 --> 42:49.880
and get there and have it in two years instead of 10 years.

42:49.880 --> 42:52.540
Yeah, that seems like one of the key things there.

42:52.540 --> 42:54.080
So what are some of those things?

42:54.080 --> 42:55.600
You touched on this just for a second there.

42:55.600 --> 42:57.480
It sounds like Stratus would be using

42:57.480 --> 43:00.640
some of the same plumbing that LVM's been using for years.

43:00.640 --> 43:04.520
What are some of those existing well-established components

43:04.520 --> 43:06.580
of Linux that Stratus takes advantage of?

43:06.580 --> 43:11.240
Well, I think people, a lot of time, if they've used LVM,

43:12.660 --> 43:15.760
there's LVM and then there's this thing called Device Mapper

43:15.760 --> 43:20.200
and Device Mapper is the kernel code that LVM uses.

43:20.200 --> 43:22.320
So you can use Device Mapper through LVM,

43:22.320 --> 43:24.840
but you can also use Device Mapper in other ways.

43:24.840 --> 43:27.480
And Device Mapper, learning how to use Device Mapper

43:27.480 --> 43:30.400
for me was really like a kid in a candy shop

43:30.400 --> 43:32.240
because, I mean, there's so much there.

43:32.240 --> 43:34.080
There's so many capabilities.

43:34.080 --> 43:37.640
There's RAID, there's thin provisioning, there's integrity.

43:37.640 --> 43:41.960
There's all these fringe Device Mapper targets

43:41.960 --> 43:43.320
that different people have written

43:43.320 --> 43:45.260
that do different cool things.

43:45.260 --> 43:49.480
And all of those things can be put together in different ways

43:49.480 --> 43:51.060
and used in different ways.

43:51.060 --> 43:52.960
And you can use LVM to do that,

43:52.960 --> 43:55.160
but there are also different ways

43:55.160 --> 43:57.780
that you can put the Lego box together.

43:57.780 --> 44:00.280
So that's what we're trying to do with Stratus

44:00.280 --> 44:04.520
and make those available and more friendly to use.

44:04.520 --> 44:05.600
It really seems in that sense

44:05.600 --> 44:08.040
that Device Mapper is doing a lot of the magic

44:08.040 --> 44:10.280
and you've just been able to tie it together

44:10.280 --> 44:13.360
and add on a little bit of niceness with XFS on top.

44:13.360 --> 44:14.240
A lot of it, yeah.

44:14.240 --> 44:17.800
So I mean, one thing that Stratus 1.0 supports

44:17.800 --> 44:19.800
is thin provisioning.

44:19.800 --> 44:22.880
So this is something that lets you create file systems

44:22.880 --> 44:25.320
and they don't actually use the amount of space

44:25.320 --> 44:26.160
that they're actually using

44:26.160 --> 44:27.720
and you can have a pool that's shared

44:27.720 --> 44:29.660
amongst different file systems.

44:29.660 --> 44:32.560
Stratus supports this,

44:32.560 --> 44:35.560
but it's like, we haven't had to like implement it.

44:35.560 --> 44:38.000
The other smart people who have implemented

44:38.000 --> 44:41.360
the thin provisioning support in Device Mapper,

44:41.360 --> 44:43.360
we just get to make use of that.

44:43.360 --> 44:45.740
We get to make it easier to use for people.

44:45.740 --> 44:48.480
And that makes, I mean,

44:48.480 --> 44:51.440
that saves a tremendous amount of effort to leverage that.

44:51.440 --> 44:54.960
And like you said, to leverage XFS file system,

44:54.960 --> 44:56.120
we don't have to write a file system.

44:56.120 --> 44:57.520
We have a great file system

44:57.520 --> 44:59.240
that we can just pick up and use.

44:59.240 --> 45:00.080
So.

45:00.080 --> 45:00.920
Amen to that, brother.

45:00.920 --> 45:01.740
Yeah.

45:01.740 --> 45:02.580
Amen.

45:02.580 --> 45:04.080
So speaking of great file systems,

45:04.080 --> 45:07.400
one thing I've always enjoyed about ZFS is by and large,

45:07.400 --> 45:08.600
I can kind of move things around.

45:08.600 --> 45:10.800
If I've made a dataset on one machine,

45:10.800 --> 45:14.000
as long as it doesn't have a lot of crazy feature flags,

45:14.000 --> 45:15.960
I can use that on another machine.

45:15.960 --> 45:17.320
How's that gonna work for Stratus,

45:17.320 --> 45:19.820
especially if, you know, different kernel versions,

45:19.820 --> 45:22.640
different user space tools exist, will it be portable?

45:22.640 --> 45:25.760
I think it won't be entirely,

45:25.760 --> 45:28.840
if you're, it always goes back to the things

45:28.840 --> 45:31.500
that Stratus is kind of wrapping and putting a bow on.

45:31.500 --> 45:33.520
So it's like, you need a file system,

45:33.520 --> 45:35.680
you need a kernel that supports XFS.

45:35.680 --> 45:36.620
Well, they're all, you know,

45:36.620 --> 45:38.480
that's all of them at this point.

45:38.480 --> 45:40.560
You need a kernel that supports

45:40.560 --> 45:42.520
the device mapper targets that we're using.

45:42.520 --> 45:47.520
So that's thin provisioning and a cache target.

45:47.660 --> 45:49.520
So, and that's pretty much all of them too,

45:49.520 --> 45:52.280
but there's a lot of other device mapper targets

45:52.280 --> 45:53.440
on the horizon.

45:53.440 --> 45:57.960
One really exciting one is called VDO,

45:57.960 --> 46:02.600
which does a block level deduplication and compression.

46:02.600 --> 46:05.700
So if in some future Stratus version,

46:05.700 --> 46:08.220
we incorporate support for VDO,

46:08.220 --> 46:11.400
then that would mean that, you know,

46:11.400 --> 46:13.800
we'll have checks and stuff to make sure that

46:13.800 --> 46:16.460
if you then move those, that pool,

46:16.460 --> 46:18.280
that file system to an older machine

46:18.280 --> 46:20.840
that doesn't have support for that in the kernel for that,

46:20.840 --> 46:23.440
that that's a consequence of, you know,

46:23.440 --> 46:25.020
if it's not there, then it can't work.

46:25.020 --> 46:28.400
So that's kind of where we are.

46:28.400 --> 46:29.240
Okay.

46:29.240 --> 46:31.200
I think that's probably to be expected,

46:31.200 --> 46:33.100
especially at this stage in the project.

46:33.100 --> 46:34.280
So let me ask you something else

46:34.280 --> 46:37.360
that's gonna be a little more challenging to answer.

46:38.320 --> 46:41.780
If I were to have a conversation with say a ZFS expert,

46:41.780 --> 46:46.600
they tell me that what part of what makes ZFS so dang great

46:46.600 --> 46:49.280
is that it's total integration from top to bottom.

46:49.280 --> 46:51.000
In fact, there's such fans of it.

46:51.000 --> 46:51.840
Andy, they'd say,

46:51.840 --> 46:54.060
don't even use one of those dirty RAID controller cards.

46:54.060 --> 46:56.040
Don't put a dirty hardware RAID in there.

46:56.040 --> 46:58.380
Let ZFS control the entire stack

46:58.380 --> 47:00.380
because of its integrated brilliance.

47:00.380 --> 47:02.680
And then Andy comes along and says,

47:02.680 --> 47:04.240
actually, we could do this

47:04.240 --> 47:06.080
with a bunch of different existing technologies

47:06.080 --> 47:07.960
and have something that works great.

47:07.960 --> 47:10.080
What's your response to the,

47:10.080 --> 47:13.680
it has to be integrated or it's gonna be bogus?

47:13.680 --> 47:15.980
That's, yes.

47:17.320 --> 47:18.880
It almost feels like a religion war

47:18.880 --> 47:19.840
when I hear them talk about it.

47:19.840 --> 47:22.200
It's like, it's a way of believing that,

47:22.200 --> 47:24.800
like it's a handcrafted integrated solution.

47:24.800 --> 47:25.640
But in a way,

47:25.640 --> 47:29.520
Stratus feels more like a genuine old school Unix solution.

47:29.520 --> 47:30.920
I think that's a good point.

47:30.920 --> 47:33.240
I mean, so Unix is about like reuse

47:33.240 --> 47:36.600
and combining things that do one thing

47:36.600 --> 47:39.200
into things that do multiple things.

47:39.200 --> 47:44.200
So, ZFS has been called a rampant layering violation.

47:44.840 --> 47:46.580
And I think they did it for good reasons.

47:46.580 --> 47:49.660
There are advantages to doing it that way.

47:49.660 --> 47:53.420
Some, I think that,

47:53.420 --> 47:55.100
I'm not sure if all those advantages

47:55.100 --> 47:57.420
have actually been fully realized.

47:57.420 --> 47:59.420
So, I'm pretty optimistic

47:59.420 --> 48:02.140
about what we'll be able to achieve.

48:02.140 --> 48:03.860
Like one of the things is like,

48:03.860 --> 48:08.860
like if you have a disc that fails on a ZFS pool,

48:09.380 --> 48:12.400
it's like you can track like, or excuse me,

48:12.400 --> 48:14.340
if you have like a sector that fails on a disc

48:14.340 --> 48:16.900
in a ZFS pool, it's like you can track all the way up

48:16.900 --> 48:19.880
through the ZFS data structures

48:19.880 --> 48:22.620
to like exactly the files that are affected.

48:22.620 --> 48:27.180
So, that is gonna be harder for Stratus,

48:27.180 --> 48:29.980
but I think it still could be possible.

48:29.980 --> 48:31.560
And I think that there are other advantages

48:31.560 --> 48:33.780
that having a more layered approach give us

48:33.780 --> 48:36.900
that can outweigh that.

48:36.900 --> 48:38.620
So, looking at some of your documentation,

48:38.620 --> 48:41.020
it really became clear that the API

48:41.020 --> 48:43.020
is a core part of Stratus

48:43.020 --> 48:45.460
and that there's a lot of design around making that

48:45.460 --> 48:47.020
like a prime feature.

48:47.020 --> 48:48.100
Why is that?

48:48.100 --> 48:52.980
Well, I think if you look at the state of computing now

48:52.980 --> 48:55.660
compared to 10 years ago,

48:55.660 --> 48:59.780
we have this kind of, if you wanna call it a renaissance,

48:59.780 --> 49:01.460
you have this move to the cloud,

49:01.460 --> 49:06.120
you have orchestration, you have Kubernetes,

49:06.120 --> 49:09.220
you have Docker, you have Puppet, you have Chef.

49:09.220 --> 49:12.620
I mean, individual machines are less configured by people

49:12.620 --> 49:15.260
and more configured by kind of layers of automation

49:15.260 --> 49:19.020
on top to achieve more productivity.

49:19.020 --> 49:21.340
So, I think it was very important for us

49:21.340 --> 49:23.580
that Stratus be able to work

49:23.580 --> 49:25.740
within an automated environment.

49:25.740 --> 49:28.140
And I think having the API is very important

49:28.140 --> 49:30.340
to making sure that that's possible.

49:30.340 --> 49:31.740
I mean, I'm grateful already

49:31.740 --> 49:33.920
just if I don't have to do any more text scraping

49:33.920 --> 49:37.620
of command line utilities, if there's a real API, oh boy.

49:37.620 --> 49:39.020
No kidding, right?

49:39.020 --> 49:42.700
I'm really not a fan of scraping of command line tools

49:42.700 --> 49:46.300
and that's, it's, yeah.

49:46.300 --> 49:49.100
So, I really feel strongly at that

49:49.100 --> 49:52.180
and that really kind of made the API be something

49:52.180 --> 49:53.660
that we really wanted to focus on.

49:53.660 --> 49:56.460
And I think that's gonna be one of the leading factors

49:56.460 --> 49:58.420
of adoption for this.

49:58.420 --> 49:59.460
I think that's what's gonna drive

49:59.460 --> 50:00.760
other distributions to adopt it.

50:00.760 --> 50:02.140
So, let's talk about that for a second.

50:02.140 --> 50:02.980
Okay.

50:02.980 --> 50:05.500
I bet the intention here is to have this

50:05.500 --> 50:08.420
to be more than a quote unquote red hat project.

50:08.420 --> 50:09.420
It'd probably be nice to have it be

50:09.420 --> 50:11.060
a general community project.

50:11.060 --> 50:11.900
That would be great.

50:11.900 --> 50:12.900
How is that possible?

50:12.900 --> 50:14.500
Like, what thoughts do you have there?

50:14.500 --> 50:15.680
I'm not asking you to solve the problem,

50:15.680 --> 50:17.740
but do you have thoughts around opening it up

50:17.740 --> 50:18.980
to a wider community?

50:18.980 --> 50:21.220
Well, I think it's kind of, if you build it,

50:21.220 --> 50:22.780
they will come sort of thing.

50:23.820 --> 50:26.980
Just like practicing as much of our developments

50:26.980 --> 50:30.800
in the open and on GitHub as much as possible,

50:30.800 --> 50:33.260
this ongoing discussions and IRC,

50:34.860 --> 50:37.820
that's what we can do and publicizing it

50:37.820 --> 50:42.820
and kind of stating our desires to work with other people.

50:42.900 --> 50:44.380
And I think it always,

50:44.380 --> 50:46.020
like you kind of have to like have something

50:46.020 --> 50:50.460
and then people see that and they wanna work on something

50:50.460 --> 50:54.100
that their efforts aren't gonna go to waste.

50:54.100 --> 50:58.280
So, I hope that with 1.0, we've shown that we're serious

50:58.280 --> 51:01.680
and that we'd like to work with other people and build it.

51:01.680 --> 51:03.460
And the more the project goes on,

51:03.460 --> 51:06.940
like the more possible new things and interesting things

51:06.940 --> 51:11.320
that people could hook onto and make their own

51:11.320 --> 51:12.160
in the code base,

51:12.160 --> 51:14.860
I think the number of those things has really gone up.

51:14.860 --> 51:17.980
So, I'm hopeful that people will do that.

51:17.980 --> 51:22.620
It's a little bit difficult because we chose...

51:22.620 --> 51:24.140
So, we didn't write it in C,

51:24.140 --> 51:26.540
we decided to write it in Rust.

51:26.540 --> 51:28.340
And there's a lot of reasons why we decided to do that,

51:28.340 --> 51:29.240
that we can talk about,

51:29.240 --> 51:32.820
but the big concern was that that was gonna hinder

51:32.820 --> 51:37.020
our adoption of that was gonna kind of push away developers

51:37.020 --> 51:38.620
a little bit, I hope it doesn't,

51:38.620 --> 51:42.340
and maybe it'll attract other potential developers.

51:42.340 --> 51:43.860
So, it was like developers

51:43.860 --> 51:47.300
and then getting onto other distros

51:47.300 --> 51:52.300
that it's an additional build dependency that is there.

51:53.800 --> 51:57.100
So, I'm hoping that things will work out.

51:57.100 --> 51:59.000
Right, I think the choice to use Rust

51:59.000 --> 52:00.900
was a really fascinating one.

52:00.900 --> 52:03.460
I think that's actually something I've heard people mention

52:03.460 --> 52:04.380
about the project.

52:04.380 --> 52:07.220
So, it's created some hype in some circles at least.

52:07.220 --> 52:09.060
So, maybe it's done some good as well.

52:09.060 --> 52:10.360
Yeah, the little Rust circles,

52:10.360 --> 52:11.980
they're definitely behind us.

52:11.980 --> 52:13.940
Yeah, they're passionate.

52:13.940 --> 52:17.500
Okay, well, 1.0 is obviously a big deal symbolically.

52:17.500 --> 52:19.660
Does this mean I should be using Stratus?

52:19.660 --> 52:21.300
Are you recommending it for general use

52:21.300 --> 52:22.820
or even just for playing around

52:22.820 --> 52:24.620
or should we hold off a bit?

52:24.620 --> 52:28.700
I think 1.0 is important for a couple big reasons,

52:28.700 --> 52:32.100
like putting a stake in the ground

52:32.100 --> 52:34.240
and stabilizing our on-disk metadata.

52:34.240 --> 52:35.580
I think that was important.

52:36.540 --> 52:37.380
We're working,

52:37.380 --> 52:40.460
let's just say we're working on a 1.01 release right now

52:40.460 --> 52:42.780
that's gonna fix some pretty serious issues

52:42.780 --> 52:45.220
and we're also working on a 1.1 release.

52:45.220 --> 52:49.600
So, I would definitely hold off,

52:49.600 --> 52:50.740
even adventurous people,

52:50.740 --> 52:53.420
just give us like a couple more months

52:53.420 --> 52:56.260
and then the less adventurous people,

52:56.260 --> 52:58.260
they can hear what the adventurous people say

52:58.260 --> 53:00.340
and then they can make a decision at that point.

53:00.340 --> 53:05.340
Is the goal to get 1.0 of some form shipped in Fedora 29?

53:05.460 --> 53:06.300
Yeah, that's the goal.

53:06.300 --> 53:09.460
We're a Fedora feature.

53:09.460 --> 53:12.020
0.5 was in Fedora 28.

53:12.020 --> 53:12.860
Oh yeah.

53:12.860 --> 53:14.860
And was pretty rough,

53:14.860 --> 53:16.420
but I mean, it's more about like,

53:16.420 --> 53:19.780
you kind of need these milestones for yourself

53:19.780 --> 53:22.180
and for people who are following the project

53:22.180 --> 53:24.020
to kind of understand where the things are.

53:24.020 --> 53:27.580
So, 1.0 will be in Fedora 29.

53:27.580 --> 53:29.420
I think that's gonna be probably the best place

53:29.420 --> 53:32.180
for a lot of people to try out Stratus.

53:32.180 --> 53:34.140
I heard you say we a few times.

53:34.140 --> 53:35.820
Can you give me like a rough idea

53:35.820 --> 53:37.020
of like how is the project structured?

53:37.020 --> 53:39.100
Is it more than just Andy?

53:39.100 --> 53:39.940
Is it a few people?

53:39.940 --> 53:42.100
Is it a whole division within Red Hat

53:42.100 --> 53:43.020
that has its own building?

53:43.020 --> 53:43.860
Like what kind of?

53:43.860 --> 53:45.780
Okay, all right.

53:45.780 --> 53:47.380
But maybe that's a little overboard,

53:47.380 --> 53:48.900
but like what's it look like?

53:48.900 --> 53:51.820
Well, our core team is four people right now,

53:51.820 --> 53:55.300
including myself, all Red Hat people

53:55.300 --> 53:58.620
and we've also had a number of kind of

53:58.620 --> 54:01.300
what you could call like drive-by contributions

54:01.300 --> 54:03.460
from a number of people mixing up things.

54:03.460 --> 54:06.820
So yeah, there's four of us at Red Hat

54:06.820 --> 54:09.260
currently working full-time on the project

54:09.260 --> 54:13.940
and hopefully we can attract some more small contributions

54:13.940 --> 54:15.180
and then those small contributions

54:15.180 --> 54:17.580
can lead to larger contributions.

54:18.460 --> 54:22.180
Well, Andy, I'll have links to the project page,

54:22.180 --> 54:23.220
your Twitter.

54:23.220 --> 54:25.060
Is there anywhere else you wanna send people to

54:25.060 --> 54:26.980
that might be interested in the project?

54:27.940 --> 54:32.380
Well, we had a G Plus page before they killed G Plus.

54:32.380 --> 54:34.140
Too soon, too soon, Andy.

54:34.140 --> 54:36.700
I would also just, yeah,

54:36.700 --> 54:39.100
make sure you put the Stratus storage Twitter.

54:39.100 --> 54:42.100
I think that's the primary one, so.

54:42.100 --> 54:44.740
We will have that in the show notes as well.

54:44.740 --> 54:46.820
Well, Andy, I hope you and the team keep up the great work.

54:46.820 --> 54:49.100
We're pretty excited to watch where this project goes

54:49.100 --> 54:50.500
and thanks so much for coming on the show

54:50.500 --> 54:51.620
and explaining some of this to us.

54:51.620 --> 54:53.020
Maybe we'll chat again in the future.

54:53.020 --> 54:54.620
All right, well, hey, thanks for having me

54:54.620 --> 54:56.500
and have a good one.

54:56.500 --> 54:59.180
It's gonna be an XFS future, I think,

54:59.180 --> 55:02.620
at least for a lot of us, not like ZFS is going anywhere,

55:02.620 --> 55:06.540
but it'll be nice to see this sort of become an option

55:06.540 --> 55:08.060
for Linux users, I think.

55:08.060 --> 55:09.580
I'm delighted to hear they've based it

55:09.580 --> 55:12.260
on the existing technologies for the most part

55:12.260 --> 55:14.460
and most importantly, XFS.

55:14.460 --> 55:16.740
I am looking forward to the thin provisioning.

55:16.740 --> 55:18.700
I was talking to Wes about that.

55:18.700 --> 55:21.380
I have a one terabyte MVNE in my disk,

55:21.380 --> 55:23.260
or in my laptop, it's a one terabyte disk

55:23.260 --> 55:25.580
and I am really looking forward to just saying,

55:25.580 --> 55:29.020
make home a terabyte and I'll just figure it out later.

55:29.020 --> 55:30.740
I have to look at the space eventually at some point

55:30.740 --> 55:33.220
and LVM was always too much to manage.

55:33.220 --> 55:34.220
This is gonna be nice.

55:34.220 --> 55:36.900
Yeah, you have a simple, I mean, we've already tried it.

55:36.900 --> 55:39.300
The command line interface is pretty clean.

55:39.300 --> 55:41.980
It was easy to get set up, it's easy to use, it's fast.

55:41.980 --> 55:43.860
So there's not a lot of blockers

55:43.860 --> 55:46.100
once you actually have a package to install.

55:46.100 --> 55:47.340
All right, well, we'll keep an eye on it,

55:47.340 --> 55:50.380
see where things goes and we'll have all the links

55:50.380 --> 55:52.740
in the show notes where you can read more,

55:52.740 --> 55:54.900
including get diagrams about how this thing works

55:54.900 --> 55:57.260
or what layer it's sitting in the Linux stack

55:57.260 --> 55:58.340
and all of that is there.

55:58.340 --> 56:00.740
Also, for your reading enjoyment,

56:01.740 --> 56:03.700
this is a great benchmark that Wes found

56:03.700 --> 56:07.580
over at scalegrid.io and they decided to compare XFS

56:07.580 --> 56:12.580
and Extended 4 on their AWS EC2 MongoDB instances.

56:12.580 --> 56:14.040
How about that for a title?

56:14.040 --> 56:16.620
And you know what, both are great file systems

56:16.620 --> 56:18.100
is the long and short of it.

56:18.100 --> 56:23.060
And if you have a moderate to, you know, average rig,

56:23.060 --> 56:24.660
you're really not gonna see much of a difference

56:24.660 --> 56:25.500
in terms of performance.

56:25.500 --> 56:26.380
Probably just doesn't matter, right?

56:26.380 --> 56:28.180
Pick the one that is easiest to use.

56:28.180 --> 56:30.220
However, if you have a significant workload

56:30.220 --> 56:34.380
or you have a particularly fast rig and fast disk,

56:34.380 --> 56:35.900
well, this is how they summed up the difference.

56:35.900 --> 56:37.580
I thought it was pretty good.

56:37.580 --> 56:40.240
They say XFS is spectacularly fast

56:40.240 --> 56:44.220
during both the insertion phase and the workload execution.

56:44.220 --> 56:48.540
And they say down in the like really pushing type workloads

56:48.540 --> 56:50.980
that XFS maintains its lead and its throughput

56:50.980 --> 56:52.340
better than Extended 4 does.

56:52.340 --> 56:54.980
And in general, in performance terms,

56:54.980 --> 56:58.900
XFS is indeed a force multiplier

56:58.900 --> 57:00.480
when paired with high-speed disk

57:00.480 --> 57:04.740
that can take a real advantage of a high-end PC.

57:04.740 --> 57:08.100
It is a force multiplier, they write Wes,

57:08.100 --> 57:09.220
a force multiplier.

57:09.220 --> 57:10.340
XFS is just great.

57:10.340 --> 57:11.580
I just really love it.

57:11.580 --> 57:14.300
That's why I was so stung when those guys and gals

57:14.300 --> 57:15.700
over at Dropbox announced

57:15.700 --> 57:17.260
that they were ending support for anything.

57:17.260 --> 57:18.980
It was rough, it was rough.

57:18.980 --> 57:20.060
It's such a good file system.

57:20.060 --> 57:21.860
I'm not over it yet, I'm not over it yet.

57:21.860 --> 57:24.380
Replacing Dropbox is one of the many things

57:24.380 --> 57:25.260
on my to-do list.

57:25.260 --> 57:26.860
I got a lot going on, you know?

57:26.860 --> 57:29.140
Living the VP life these days, Wes.

57:29.140 --> 57:31.020
I got wound care, I got a lot going on.

57:31.020 --> 57:31.980
I got three kids, Wes.

57:31.980 --> 57:33.740
You don't even sleep, that's how busy you are.

57:33.740 --> 57:34.740
This is actually true.

57:34.740 --> 57:37.140
This is just a lot going on and I need to manage all of it,

57:37.140 --> 57:38.640
reclaim some of my sanity,

57:38.640 --> 57:40.740
so I've decided to get my crap together.

57:40.740 --> 57:42.980
So you got just a big wall of post-it notes?

57:42.980 --> 57:43.940
I assume that's what you're doing.

57:43.940 --> 57:45.580
Actually did start with a whiteboard,

57:45.580 --> 57:49.580
realized that did not scale, also was not portable,

57:49.580 --> 57:53.340
and could not be done on the fly via my phone.

57:53.340 --> 57:57.380
So then I wanted something that would let me manage my tasks

57:57.380 --> 58:02.020
from the phone, from a lady tube, and from Linux.

58:02.020 --> 58:03.980
That's a big ask, those are some integrations.

58:03.980 --> 58:05.520
You know, there's some really nice to-do apps

58:05.520 --> 58:06.860
for every phone out there.

58:06.860 --> 58:07.700
They're really great,

58:07.700 --> 58:09.100
but they're like only available for the phone.

58:09.100 --> 58:11.220
Like they don't have a web component necessarily.

58:11.220 --> 58:13.860
That's okay, I can't, I need something on the desktop.

58:13.860 --> 58:15.540
Or the ones that do like Wunderlist

58:15.540 --> 58:16.900
have never really stuck with me.

58:16.900 --> 58:18.580
It's never really held me down.

58:18.580 --> 58:20.940
I can't really, it just doesn't work with me.

58:20.940 --> 58:24.060
Well, I'm pretty pleased so far with Todoist,

58:24.060 --> 58:26.700
and I've linked in the show notes, it is an Electron app,

58:26.700 --> 58:29.340
but it is a wrapper for the official Todoist web app,

58:29.340 --> 58:30.740
and it's, I tried a couple of them.

58:30.740 --> 58:33.560
There's a few of them out there if you search for this,

58:33.560 --> 58:35.300
but this is the one I like the best.

58:35.300 --> 58:38.260
It'll support auto start and minimize down to the tray

58:38.260 --> 58:39.820
with a system tray icon.

58:39.820 --> 58:41.420
It has keyboard shortcuts

58:41.420 --> 58:44.280
that work more like the native application.

58:44.280 --> 58:48.580
It has just a native-like desktop feel.

58:48.580 --> 58:50.100
It has the quirks of a web app,

58:50.100 --> 58:52.660
but they've gotten it pretty close,

58:52.660 --> 58:54.340
and it comes available as a deb

58:54.340 --> 58:56.300
or it's in a lot of different repos.

58:56.300 --> 58:58.360
Yeah, so it's easy to get going.

58:58.360 --> 59:01.740
And I've combined this with the app on the phone

59:02.800 --> 59:04.820
and the app on the lady tube,

59:04.820 --> 59:08.000
and now I've got sort of ubiquitous task management.

59:08.000 --> 59:09.820
I can summon Siri or the Echo,

59:09.820 --> 59:11.940
and I can say, add a task to my list.

59:12.980 --> 59:16.220
I can sit down, and I just have a Workspace 5

59:16.220 --> 59:17.860
dedicated to this application.

59:17.860 --> 59:19.340
It's the only thing on Workspace 5,

59:19.340 --> 59:22.020
so I can go right to Workspace 5 and make it to do boom, boom,

59:22.020 --> 59:23.500
boom as fast as I can think about it.

59:23.500 --> 59:24.340
And that's key, right?

59:24.340 --> 59:25.700
You need something, you need to be able to dump them

59:25.700 --> 59:27.540
as they come up, as you come up with them.

59:27.540 --> 59:29.140
Yeah, the other thing is great.

59:29.140 --> 59:30.900
It has natural language support.

59:31.760 --> 59:34.340
So if I need to, say, write down a task

59:34.340 --> 59:36.960
to finish the expense report for that lunch

59:36.960 --> 59:38.420
we went out to on Friday,

59:38.420 --> 59:42.340
I can write finish expense report Wednesday at 1 p.m.,

59:42.340 --> 59:45.160
and it will automatically just, it'll understand that,

59:45.160 --> 59:46.920
and it'll create the finish expense report,

59:46.920 --> 59:49.920
and then the Wednesday, and it'll itemize all of that out

59:49.920 --> 59:53.100
and create a reminder, yeah, and put it on the calendar.

59:53.100 --> 59:54.980
It's nice, it's really smooth.

59:54.980 --> 59:58.260
So getting a version on Linux that felt close to native,

59:58.260 --> 01:00:01.500
that had a tray icon and all of that kind of stuff

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:03.700
to like a full-fledged application,

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:05.520
that's what sort of pushed it over the edge for me

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:06.360
from some of the other ones.

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:09.500
So we'll have a link into Todoist for Linux.

01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:12.060
There's a lot of them out there,

01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:14.580
but only one of them passed the Chris Niff test.

01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:15.540
So you gotta check that out.

01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:17.300
I mean, I know you're picky about these apps, too,

01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:20.060
so you're pickier than I am, so that's probably a good bet.

01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:21.160
It's worth checking out.

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:22.780
You watch out, don't get me too hyped,

01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:23.860
because if I go all into it,

01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:25.900
then I'll sign up for the Enterprise version,

01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:27.840
and I'll be getting you to install it, so.

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:28.680
All right.

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:29.500
Well, see how it goes.

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:30.340
I like it.

01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:31.540
You say that now, you say that now.

01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:32.380
It's pretty cool.

01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:34.980
It does have good team management features,

01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:37.820
and the other thing that kind of made me want to use Todoist

01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:40.220
over some of the other quote-unquote services

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:41.780
or self-hosted solutions,

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:46.700
I want something that is a Todo application

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:49.060
for a spectrum of my life.

01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:52.880
Like, it's not like a full spectrum Todo management.

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:57.380
It's kind of like a narrow slice

01:00:57.380 --> 01:00:59.820
of the things I need to do in my work and personal life.

01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:01.620
It's kind of a weird way I have it,

01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:03.060
and so I'm using Todoist for that,

01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:05.900
and for this particular slice,

01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:08.540
it's really great to be able to send things

01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:10.780
in and out of Todoist from different applications.

01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:15.100
So I've got like this OCR scanner for my phone.

01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:16.860
Yeah, like I hold it over a receipt.

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:19.340
Oh yeah, like just some document you want to, totally.

01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:20.960
It imports all the details,

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:23.220
and it figures out what I paid at the restaurant,

01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:24.700
and then I can import that

01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:27.140
into the expense management system.

01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:28.900
All of that routes through Todoist.

01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:30.620
Todoist is sort of like the central piece

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:31.620
that can coordinate all of that,

01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:32.860
so it's really nice to have something

01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:36.540
that you don't get from a self-hosted task warrior server.

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:38.860
I've tried, and I mean, it was not too bad,

01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:40.460
but just not that shiny.

01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:41.380
You know, I could see a place

01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:43.420
for like a separate task management system

01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:45.660
that was for like stuff with the family,

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:48.980
and the dog, and you know, like my medical stuff.

01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:50.960
Yeah, I've had some look for like shared Trello boards

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:51.900
for that sort of thing.

01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:52.720
But that's for like-

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:53.560
Whoa, full Trello.

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:54.580
Full Trello, Wes?

01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:56.740
That was for some bigger plannings.

01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:57.580
You maniac.

01:01:57.580 --> 01:01:59.060
Maybe this works better for things where you just like,

01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:00.420
yeah, firing off one-off tasks

01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:01.480
you need to not forget about.

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:02.940
See, TechMav knows exactly what's up.

01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:04.420
TechMav in the chat room says,

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:06.740
ScanBot and Todoist, this is what I'm talking about.

01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:08.140
This is what actually pushed me over

01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:10.700
is when I started using these two apps together.

01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:12.100
Bosh.

01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:14.220
Mind-blowing, man, just mind-blowingly.

01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:16.040
It makes doing some of those tedious things

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:18.480
that I hate to do and forget to do easy,

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:21.500
because when I have the receipt in my task manager,

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:23.900
it's like when that task comes due,

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:25.820
the information I need to complete the task

01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:27.460
is right there in OCR for me.

01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:28.820
Copy, paste, boom, I'm done.

01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:29.860
It makes it so much quicker.

01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:30.700
I love it.

01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:32.100
You just get your work done.

01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:36.380
And they give you an iCal feed

01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:38.060
so you can sync it to a calendar

01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:40.620
so you can get all of the tasks overlaid on your calendar.

01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:41.660
Perfect, I love it.

01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:43.700
So anyways, that's my pitch for Todoist.

01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:45.980
I actually signed up for their premium one, too,

01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:47.220
because then you get some features

01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:48.340
that they should just build in.

01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:50.040
I'm pretty sure you just want an excuse

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:51.820
to promote one more Electron app.

01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:54.540
Well done, well done, sir.

01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:56.540
You are talking to the guy who runs Netafire

01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:58.540
on all of the web apps he uses all the time now.

01:02:58.540 --> 01:02:59.500
I'm that guy.

01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:03.820
I'm like, I'm spinning up spaces on my desktop.

01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:05.460
I'm spinning up virtual desktops,

01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:07.420
just that way I can put another Netafire window

01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:08.400
on that virtual desktop.

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:09.240
It's getting better.

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:12.020
There's so many damn web apps these days, Wes, so many.

01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:14.540
All right, well go get yourself some more poppy and wimpy

01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:16.860
and Mark II over at the Ubuntu podcast.

01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:17.980
Go enjoy.

01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:19.580
Another fine episode.

01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:22.100
Is it season 11, episode 30 that just came out?

01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:23.160
It is, yeah.

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:24.420
Ooh, it's getting close, isn't it?

01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:25.500
It's getting close.

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:28.480
It's almost end of season time.

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:29.320
Oh no.

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:32.420
Three months and then we'll take a season break.

01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:33.940
Oh, it's, oh, okay, three months.

01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:34.760
That's not too bad.

01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:35.600
What are we gonna do?

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:37.180
Yeah, we finish at Christmas.

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:38.020
Oh, okay.

01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:39.400
That's not, I mean, I can prep myself.

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:41.940
That's enough time for me to let that soak in.

01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:44.580
I can, that's, you know, that's good to know

01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:45.920
because now I can prep myself.

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:46.960
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:48.220
What do you listen to when you need a break

01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:49.540
from your relatives around the holidays?

01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:50.900
We need a season break, you're right.

01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:53.140
We do need a season break, I like that.

01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:54.980
Our season could just be like the Christmas holiday.

01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:55.820
It could be, yeah.

01:03:55.820 --> 01:03:57.700
You know, it could be like a short season break.

01:03:57.700 --> 01:03:59.500
We don't have to like have this whole curry rule.

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:00.340
That could just be something.

01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:02.020
We could just get curry on the side anyway

01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:02.860
while we're working.

01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:03.680
Yeah, man.

01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:04.520
You're doing it wrong.

01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:05.860
If you don't have curry, you're just doing it wrong.

01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:06.700
Yeah, we really.

01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:07.520
That's mandatory.

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:09.180
So yeah, okay, all right, that doesn't make sense.

01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:10.860
The more we think about it, actually.

01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:14.180
If we can have an excuse to mandate getting curry,

01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:15.540
why would we not take that?

01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:16.380
God, what was I thinking?

01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:17.200
They're brilliant over there.

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:19.540
You know, you just gotta watch and pay attention

01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:21.400
and just pick up a few lessons from time to time.

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:22.380
That's true.

01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:24.420
Go get more Westpane over on the TechSnap show,

01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:26.180
TechSnap.Systems.

01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:27.500
He's also at Westpane.

01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:29.540
Why do I always doubt that?

01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:30.380
It's accurate.

01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:31.200
You're spot on.

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:32.600
It's a pain with a Y, too.

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:33.440
Oh, yeah.

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:34.900
Like an action hero.

01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:37.100
Like an 80s movie actor, action hero.

01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:38.500
That's pretty much how my life goes.

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:41.620
You're like the podcasting version of Hulk Hogan

01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:45.380
without the whole drama thing that happened with Gawker.

01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:46.200
Let's not bring that up.

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:47.040
Yeah, let's not bring that up.

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:47.960
All right, I'm at Chris LAS.

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:49.980
You can follow me on the Twitter if you'd like.

01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:50.820
I don't really care.

01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:51.660
I don't use it a whole lot,

01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:53.300
but I do try to respond to tweets.

01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:55.420
So I try to be a good Twitter citizen that way.

01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:56.780
I'll also mention the Telegram group.

01:04:56.780 --> 01:04:58.300
It's been quite a while since we've plugged that,

01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:01.420
JupiterBroadcasting.com slash Telegram.

01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:03.360
Go there and join the conversation,

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:06.320
and every now and then a random host pops in there

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:07.280
and starts chatting with people, too.

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:08.120
It's pretty fun.

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:11.120
And of course, we encourage you to join this show live.

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:12.900
We do it on a Tuesday at 2 p.m. Pacific.

01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:14.500
You can get that converted to your time zone

01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:17.300
over at JupiterBroadcasting.com slash calendar.

01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:19.320
Now links to everything we talked about today

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:22.100
over at LinuxUnplugged.com slash 270,

01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:24.160
including the stuff for Project Stratus,

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:26.580
and more information about Easel

01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:28.140
and their contributions to open source.

01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:29.660
Go read up about all of that,

01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:33.140
as well as the community news and bonus links in there

01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:35.980
that didn't even make it in the podcast.

01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:37.340
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode

01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:38.400
of the Unplugged program.

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:39.640
Hope you can join us live next week,

01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:43.060
but if you can't, LinuxUnplugged.com slash subscribe

01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:48.060
for all the ways to get this show every single Tuesday!

01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:53.060
Wait!

01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:29.160
All right, 270 feels like a nice round one.

01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:30.660
Nice round one right there.

01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:31.660
Quality episode.

01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:32.980
It's really great.

01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:34.180
Thank you Andy for having you on.

01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:36.160
Great to get those questions answered in there.

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:38.820
Now we just got to name this thing and then we're going to clear out for the Ask Noah

01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:40.980
program which is coming up on the live stream next.

01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:42.780
I've got a question for you Chris.

01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:43.780
Yes sir.

01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:46.820
Where's this review of the Precision Workstation?

01:06:46.820 --> 01:06:49.660
Oh I know I should have said something in the show.

01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:55.100
Well you see we have a particular kind of review scenario we're putting it through and

01:06:55.100 --> 01:07:00.980
we're making a special episode that will be airing the week I go to meet BSD and so it's

01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:05.900
all part of a bigger episode so that's why it got delayed but I meant to bring something

01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:09.900
I meant to bring that up in the show because I'll give you a little preview that isn't

01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:16.420
directly related to the review but I decided 1604 is fine but let's put 1810 on there.

01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:22.220
So I put 1810 stock Ubuntu on there.

01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:27.940
When I first logged in I sat there for a minute just taking it in.

01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:30.020
I'll have to show you that's what I'm talking about.

01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:41.460
The new theme with this screen is it's vibrant it like it jumps off the screen it is beautiful.

01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:45.100
I don't know what they're doing on this monitor and I don't know what's happening in that

01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:51.140
theme but I mean Mac OS and Windows don't have anything on this look it was so gorgeous

01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:56.580
and I don't know maybe I was having a stroke when I saw it but I couldn't believe how brilliant

01:07:56.580 --> 01:07:57.580
and shiny it looked.

01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:02.260
It just looked it looked the best I've ever seen Linux look on a 4k screen and it's just

01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:08.320
this edge to edge infinity glass you know on this 4k super nice monitor man I'll show

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:09.320
you before you leave the studio.

01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:10.320
I'm excited to see it.

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:17.740
It does it does look gorgeous I've been running it in a full screen VM on my XPS 15 with a

01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:21.660
UHD panel and yes it's striking.

01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:24.780
Yeah yeah this laptop's been fun.

01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:28.580
So we had to come up with a particular challenge for it just to kind of to kind of put into

01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:32.260
a workload that maybe somebody buying a machine like this would want so it kind of delayed

01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:36.820
it because then we wanted to wrap it in with a wider subject so it'll come out but it'll

01:08:36.820 --> 01:08:42.300
probably be not next week but the week after because I'm going to meet BSD which is happening

01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:45.740
the weekend before that unplugged and then I'll be traveling home during unplugged but

01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:47.340
we'll have a show if all goes as planned.

01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:52.860
Now that I've said that on air it's better it's better happen we have promised people.

01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:56.000
I do have good news we have bad news and good news it didn't quite make it into the show

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.540
the bad news is is that a Chrome developer recently confirmed that they have no plans

01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:05.220
to enable hardware acceleration on Linux even when you go turn the flag on in the config

01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:10.900
settings it actually isn't hardware enabled it lies to you the flag is a lie it's false

01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:15.420
flag as Joey put it on OMG Ubuntu which did make me chuckle.

01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:19.460
And in his in his OMG Ubuntu article which I think we'll have in the show notes maybe

01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:23.060
make sure we have in the show notes for me would you mind I will look right now they

01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:27.320
have there is a there is a there are builds that do actually have hardware acceleration.

01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:32.740
So I when I saw that news I thought to myself well crud we're never gonna get that new game

01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:38.740
streaming tech that we just talked about last week on the show Linux users are out.

01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:47.100
However not more than eight hours ago I got confirmation from a listener who is successfully

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:54.820
playing full screen 60 frames a second 1080p Assassin's Creed on his Fedora workstation

01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:59.940
using Intel graphics as part of the beta to the project stream.

01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:05.620
So it is doable he's got a more modern Intel chipset but it is doable he says it's taking

01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:10.060
about 20 megabits a second of his network so you do have to have a pretty solid connection.

01:10:10.060 --> 01:10:11.220
They mean it.

01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:16.580
But it it does look like this project stream from Google is playable on Linux.

01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:19.300
It might just all be happening on the CPU it might not be happening on the GPU.

01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:22.180
He's just got a beefing machine.

01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:30.740
But it's it's happening.
