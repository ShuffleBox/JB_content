1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Ah, Wes.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The Cone of Silence.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In our rush to plan two episodes, we didn't prepare pre-shows for either one of them.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I thought you were bringing the pre-show.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yeah, I thought Alex was bringing the pre-show.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We've been, like, livestreaming for 45 minutes.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
How do we not have a pre-show?

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Normally they just happen.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I don't think that's how podcasting works, Wes.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I wish I could hear those guys, but they're in, like, a Cone of Silence.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Hello, friends, and welcome in to your Unplugged program.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
My name is Chris.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
My name is Wes.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Hello, Wes.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I am elated about today's episode.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
There's a lot going on.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We have a real treat today.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We're checking in with Hayden Barnes, who is intimately involved with the Windows subsystem for Linux

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and now works at Canonical.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We'll talk about some of the big things coming to that surprisingly more and more prominent platform.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hold on.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Did I just call it a platform?

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
That's actually a thing now.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We'll tell you what's going on there, what their interest is,

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and some of the big things that are about to happen just even in early 2020 that we've got to wrap our heads around.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So it's a great time.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's been just over a year since Hayden was on the show.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And a lot has changed.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Mm-hmm.

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Mm-hmm.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But before we go any further, I got to say how you doing to Alex and Cheesy.

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Hello, gents.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Hello.

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
How are you doing?

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm all right.

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm pretty good.

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We're recording doubles today live.

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So it's a big, big live day.

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Extra unplugged.

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I should say, though, that we will not be live for the next few weeks.

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So check the calendar because we're going into holiday mode.

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So it is with some honor for the last time this year I say hello, virtual lug, and time appropriate greetings.

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Hello.

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Hello, everybody.

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We've got a good showing in there today, and we have a lot to get into.

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So let's start with the community news.

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And I wanted to just talk a little bit about GNOME 3.4.

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yes, I know it's already out.

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's not news anymore.

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Although not everybody has it yet.

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But there was something in the last round of reviews and discussions that got missed.

52
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And it's a simple thing, but I think it shows some promise.

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And I wanted to give it some attention.

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And so that is the new extensions tool that is now built into GNOME Shell.

55
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's a tool just conveniently called GNOME Dash Extensions that makes it easier to create and manage GNOME Shell extensions.

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And you can go in there and turn them off, turn them on, much like the UI in GNOME Tweaks.

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But this is something actually built into the shell now and doesn't require you to install GNOME Tweaks.

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yeah, it looks like it comes with a lot of nice everyday features that you actually want to use when you're making an extension.

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So it's less of an arcane process and something that's provided first class support from upstream.

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I think it's a sign perhaps of a seriousness.

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The project is starting to take extensions, and this is the first step.

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So that's kind of why I wanted to give it a little attention.

63
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Because I didn't mention it when GNOME Shell shipped, when version 3.4 shipped.

64
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
But I thought it's something we should talk about.

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But now I want to tell you about what's coming in GNOME Shell 3.36, the next version.

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And that's big for those of you that have multiple GPUs, particularly if one of those is an NVIDIA GPU.

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Oh, yes.

68
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:27,000
GNOME developer Bastion Nocera has been cleaning up the switcheroo control code so that it doesn't rely on the kernel's VGA switcheroo.

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And so that it can support more than two GPUs, hey, that's nice, and better support of handling main and secondary options and configuration.

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But the big addition for end users is proprietary NVIDIA support.

71
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
That's nice. It's nice.

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm a child that I just find the actual project name is switcheroo control.

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
That's awesome.

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Adorable.

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
That is.

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And so in recent releases of Mudder, they've made particular changes in how it handles multiple GPUs and rendering and the logic around that and how the shell is handling external GPUs.

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
There's like a lot of stealth GPU work being done in GNOME Shell right now.

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And there's some general cleanups and improvements in the way it communicates with other applications.

79
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So the entire GNOME Shell will handle GPU switching much smoother in 3.36.

80
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's not all the way there, but a lot better.

81
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's just getting more and more stable.

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It doesn't feel like all the little pieces that we've been worrying about in GNOME Shell, they're getting patched up.

83
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Of course, none of that matters if you're WireGuard, ZFS, Python, Redis, and many other things just go away, which could potentially happen for some.

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:45,000
There is a, I mean, a very apparently hardworking maintainer for a bunch of very important PPAs for the Ubuntu ecosystem.

85
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Like I mentioned, ZFS, WireGuard, Python, 2.7 through 3.7, Perl 6, Open JDK, a bunch of other stuff that's really important.

86
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And he's had it.

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The maintainer, his first name's Jonathan, is sick and tired of commercial companies, presumably large commercial companies,

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
coming to him and asking for help and refusing to pay for his time.

89
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And so as such, he has announced that he is flipping his PPA repositories private.

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:25,000
He writes, I will be removing most of my PPAs from public access due to the continued and persistent abuse by companies using these packages for commercial gain

91
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
with flagrant disregard to the knowledge and effort required to maintain them.

92
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:37,000
These companies are quite happy to charge thousands of dollar sign currency per month for their product slash service.

93
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
But when they make a request, will absolutely not pay someone else for their time.

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And then he finishes it with a nice solid, this is why we can't have nice things, just to really kind of get it in there.

95
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And I am really torn on this one because for me, it bubbles up a lot of the frustrations I have with the Ubuntu ecosystem right now

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
in such that it brings a lot of questions to my mind.

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Oh, you're talking from the end user perspective here, just as a consumer of Ubuntu.

98
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yeah, I'm frustrated that this quote unquote enterprise grade platform that I can somehow deploy and get 10 years of support for,

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:31,000
but yet something as critical as Perl or Python or OpenJDK or Wirecard or ZFS can just be pulled because a developer is having a bad day.

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Like, why has this not been solved yet by Canonical?

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Why have snaps not matured to the point where they solve this problem?

102
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Why are we still even dealing with PPAs in nearly 2020?

103
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And the reality of it is the market is wholly dependent on the PPA sauce to make Ubuntu a practical operating system at scale.

104
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
That's the reality of it. And it's dangerous.

105
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
PPAs full stop are dangerous.

106
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:05,000
They're dangerous from a stability standpoint, as in this case, as just proven by this particular PPA author.

107
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
But what if they were dangerous in another way?

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
A way that hasn't really happened that we know of, but could be extremely devastating.

109
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:21,000
What if instead of rage quitting in a public forum, that developer decides to screw somebody and they put something malicious in those bills?

110
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:28,000
We don't really have a clear understanding of the trust model with these PPAs, but yet we're putting them in production.

111
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm frustrated that this isn't solved.

112
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm frustrated that Ubuntu has grown to the size it is and they haven't gotten over the line on this.

113
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And I'm frustrated that one angry developer can screw with a whole bunch of people's day like this.

114
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I also am frustrated that he expects to get paid.

115
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And I know that's a really controversial thing to say, and I wish he would get paid.

116
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I wish that the market dynamics were such that every bug request that comes in had a tip amount automatically attached to it, and you could put 15 bucks on a bug request.

117
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I wish it was like that.

118
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But he signed up for a job to be a free maintainer of free software, regardless of who the user is.

119
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Whether it's individual Chris or if it's a multi-billion dollar corporation, you don't pick and choose who the user of free software is.

120
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I will note that in the post, it specifically stresses that it's not just about money.

121
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's about donations, sponsorships, employment.

122
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
That's all money.

123
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It is money, but 20 percent time.

124
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I mean, I think there's a more effort being, you know, if development was being pushed upstream to help maintain these PPAs.

125
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Because the other thing here is I think you're missing a part where PPAs are definitely used at scale.

126
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But if you're a real big player, this doesn't matter to you.

127
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You can set up, you have engineer time that you can throw and fix your own problems.

128
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's the people deploying it in the middle who have taken on the risk of trusting PPAs.

129
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I think that might be a safe majority.

130
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But not a lot of shops have the time to set up their own local repos and get all their developers to put all their dependencies in those repos.

131
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And then make sure they're all on the systems that are on the network.

132
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Like it's definitely doable, especially with a Debian system.

133
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But I don't know.

134
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I bet a lot of organizations just say, ah, screw it.

135
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Just add the PPA.

136
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's got everything you need.

137
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I think it happens a lot.

138
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Oh, yeah, of course you do.

139
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm just saying the ones in the middle are the ones that are affected by this the most because they lack the ability to pivot in an easy way.

140
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And I totally completely understand that, you know, here's this guy.

141
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
He's doing volunteer work, right?

142
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
He's got a lot of other things going on in his life.

143
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
This isn't how he gets paid.

144
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And now with these kinds of requests and changes and pleas to support something that takes an extremely large amount of time, he's being put off by this.

145
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
He's being put out.

146
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
He's being asked to work a full time job and he's not getting compensated for it.

147
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's not fair.

148
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What's the alternative, though?

149
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You know, do Canonical pay him for that work?

150
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Is that a sustainable model for Canonical?

151
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Maybe, maybe not.

152
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Do you go to an AUR style model?

153
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Do you not provide them at all?

154
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You know, what's the alternative?

155
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I think there's two issues.

156
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The first issue is that's the job he signed up for.

157
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So while it's not fair and it asks for way more than it should.

158
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
That also doesn't take into account like you don't always know what you're signing up for when you start a project or start.

159
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm going to maintain this PPA for me and my friends or my company.

160
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And then in two years, it's giant.

161
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Well, that was very much the case for me with Linux server.

162
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Right.

163
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So when does it transition to a responsibility from I'm just doing this?

164
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
My answer would be to that is that it's a systemic issue that it's not solvable by the individual maintainer.

165
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It has to be solved at the system level.

166
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And I was joking when I said it, but I mean, why the hell not?

167
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Why not be able to throw a cold 50 on a bug and say whoever fixes this bug gets to claim that 50 bucks?

168
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's a bug bounty program.

169
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
There's systems out there.

170
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Elementary OS uses one.

171
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
There's systems out there for this.

172
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
But like so many things, we just fail to adopt and move because the tooling is good enough.

173
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
We got a job to do.

174
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And here we are.

175
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:06,000
But now the end result is people that are using Ubuntu in production have a less reliable, less stable system now.

176
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Or they always did.

177
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
But it's you're more aware of it now.

178
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yeah.

179
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Right.

180
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Because it's always been a problem.

181
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's not like it's just that we're really feeling that there was always a risk anytime you've added a PPA.

182
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
They can't let this stand.

183
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
They can't let this guy pull WireGuard and ZFS and Python and Redis.

184
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Ansible.

185
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
He's the maintainer for Ansible on Ubuntu.

186
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
That's kind of a big deal.

187
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So then the other question is you're talking about snaps.

188
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Are there room?

189
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Why are these PPAs needed?

190
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Obviously a lot of these are already in the repositories in older LTS style versions.

191
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And then there are other means.

192
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Is it just that the people who are actually responsible for the projects are not doing that work to package them and provide them in ways their users.

193
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Or is it not possible to use snaps to supply ZFS and WireGuard?

194
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I genuinely don't know the answer to that.

195
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I mean it seems like there's been a lot of exploration in core snaps.

196
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yeah.

197
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm not sure.

198
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
But I would assume that's how you would add support for it to Ubuntu core.

199
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
But I don't know.

200
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Well and I think that you could extend this to beyond PPAs.

201
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:15,000
If you look at other forums like GitHub where a lot of projects run into the same issue where someone's just developing it out of their own will and want.

202
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And then it gets used by these larger corporations and they're up against the same thing.

203
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Where they're doing a project that they like to do and then now there's demands being brought on them.

204
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I think GitHub has done a pretty good job though in the way that they handle it.

205
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And they have begun to sponsor certain projects and developers.

206
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And I could definitely see that being the same scenario with PPAs or things like them.

207
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Yeah it's unfortunate that we keep circling back to this.

208
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm thinking about the open SSL developer story too.

209
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Every couple of years, every couple of months this comes up.

210
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I think it's actually worse here because it is further down the food chain.

211
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
He's not even the one that's developing the software.

212
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
He's packaging it for one distribution.

213
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Now it happens to be a large one.

214
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
But this issue happens across all the distributions.

215
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And it's even more pronounced in some smaller niche distributions.

216
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Where you're really, you're just not registering on the Linux Foundation's radar or on whoever.

217
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Because you're not actually writing the code.

218
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You're just packaging it.

219
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It is an absolutely, fundamentally vital role for the consumers of the distribution.

220
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Right, that's what I'm talking about right now.

221
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Right.

222
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So it's a real humdinger because it's sort of a thankless position.

223
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
The person who is constantly keeping something up to date in a distribution,

224
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
satisfying dependencies, resolving bugs and quirks that are applicable to that distribution,

225
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
it's a never ending job.

226
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Right, you're taking on both not having direct control over the software

227
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
and interacting with all the downstream consumers.

228
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I think in this particular scenario, perhaps now that Jonathan has gotten enough attention,

229
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
maybe he could start a Patreon.

230
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
But that's not going to solve it for everybody.

231
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And there's a lot of Patreon fatigue out there.

232
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Yeah, he's got a link to a Ko-fi post.

233
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So there are some options there.

234
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
But you're right, that's not, I mean, that's clearly not a solution that's working universally.

235
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
This is a topic contributing to open source development that we're going to touch on pretty early in 2020

236
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
that we have some big thoughts on and some things to talk about.

237
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
But I think for now, we should probably just move forward because it's a really difficult situation.

238
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You can see it from his perspective.

239
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You can see it from the end consumer's perspective.

240
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Nobody wins.

241
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
But it's one of our key challenges in our ecosystem right now.

242
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
But one of the benefits of our ecosystem is we see a lot of innovation.

243
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And the popcorn pocket computer or pocket popcorn computer, something like that, could be just that.

244
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Imagine a device dedicated to a terminal in your pocket.

245
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:52,000
A full QWERTY keyboard with a 1920 by 1080 IPS 4.9 5-inch screen.

246
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Oh.

247
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
So it's meant for terminals.

248
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Yeah, QWERTY keyboard.

249
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
QWERTY, 1.2 gigahertz quad-core ARM processor, 2 gigs of RAM.

250
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I can work with that.

251
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Lots of different connectivity options, lots of different connectivity options, as well as four USB-C connectors.

252
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Whoa.

253
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
This is a real device.

254
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It's called the Pocket Popcorn Computer.

255
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And it's available as sort of a pre-order Kickstarter now.

256
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I was about to say, how do I get me one?

257
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I know.

258
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It looks really good.

259
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And geez, they've made some devices before.

260
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
They've shipped hardware.

261
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
So this isn't their first product.

262
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Yeah, so I'm not 100% sure it's done by the same creators, Next Thing Co.

263
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I was looking, or Next Thing Company, I was looking to see if it was some of those creators.

264
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And I'm not 100% sure.

265
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
But this is very similar to the Pocket Chip.

266
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The Pocket Chip Pro actually used the same CPU.

267
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You know, I'm curious.

268
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I think it would be a neat device to have.

269
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
The keyboard, the renderings, everything, it looks pretty slick.

270
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I like how they've managed to put such a nice screen in a small device.

271
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Like you said, they're about halfway to being funded right now.

272
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I think it would be a neat device to have.

273
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I just don't know, for me, if it would be incredibly useful.

274
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Yeah, if you're doing a lot of support over terminals, if you're doing a lot of remote work over SSH,

275
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I think it might be a no-brainer.

276
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Yeah, I mean, with the Pocket Chip, which I had, it was an inexpensive device, like $70 or $80.

277
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
The keyboard wasn't great.

278
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It was kind of an afterthought anyway.

279
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It was a neat device, but it wasn't really a practical device.

280
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Like I wouldn't really use it to get any work done,

281
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
whereas this particular device looks a little better.

282
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It looks like they've actually put some thought into the keyboard.

283
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You know what I like?

284
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm digging the fact that it has as many USB-C ports as a MacBook Pro.

285
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Amazing.

286
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Yeah, that is incredible.

287
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And it's got a 3200 milliamp hour battery.

288
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's got LoRa, the GNSS built into it.

289
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
So, I mean, you've got a lot of other options there that you didn't have with the Pocket Chip.

290
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
So I think it's definitely a neat device.

291
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You know, I'll wait for you guys to pick it up.

292
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Maybe since Chris and I picked up the PinePhone, maybe Wes can pick this up and let us know how it goes.

293
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Yeah, there you go, Wes.

294
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I kind of would love one just sort of bouncing around my glove box whenever I needed it.

295
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm curious if anyone in the Mumble Room would buy a device like this.

296
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
So it fits in, you know, a bag.

297
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It's pretty thin.

298
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
They focused on giving it a pretty nice QWERTY keyboard,

299
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
so it's got a decent Enter key, Shift, Escape, Tab.

300
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And, you know, the CPU has been around.

301
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's been optimized.

302
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It's totally capable of what they're promising in this thing.

303
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I mentioned IoT, too, which kind of makes sense.

304
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You could see carrying this out from the field.

305
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Maybe you're trying to troubleshoot with some devices

306
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
and you walk up and attach to it and away you go.

307
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And with a 3,200 milliamp battery, this thing is going to go for quite a while.

308
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
So it's sort of like a go-to, you know it's going to work.

309
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
All I need is like a rugged case so I don't break it.

310
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
So they've raised $20,000.

311
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
They're trying to get to $50,000 to launch this thing.

312
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Okay.

313
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
So they're about halfway-ish.

314
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,000
The pricing, once it's done, would sort of fall around $199,000 for right now,

315
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
if you do the pre-order for a device.

316
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
And if you want one with the LoRa radio and the Wi-Fi and all of the fancy radios,

317
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
that one's $299,000.

318
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Okay.

319
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
That's not terrible.

320
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I mean, we're in sort of like what, Chromebook territory?

321
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Yeah, I suppose so.

322
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Two gigs of RAM, 32 gigabytes of built-in, plus an expandable microSD slot,

323
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,000
4.9-inch, 4.95, 1080 screen IPS.

324
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I kind of like it.

325
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I don't have a need for it.

326
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Like, geez, it's like I don't do a lot of SSH that I wouldn't just do from a tablet

327
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
or from my desktop.

328
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Right.

329
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
When I need it, my phone works.

330
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It's not super pleasant, but it's not.

331
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
If I didn't have an iPad, I think I would do this.

332
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I ended up getting an iPad just mostly so I could watch videos on airplanes,

333
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
which I would not be able to use this for.

334
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
So that's the main use.

335
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I've got to catch up on my shows, Wes, on my stories.

336
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It should be said, too, that it runs Debian 10 with a mainline kernel.

337
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's compatible with Gadget OS, Buildroot.

338
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,000
The keyboard is an open source keyboard, and the LED controller firmware is also open.

339
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
So the device itself seems like it's a pretty open device,

340
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
and some of the other little firmware bits are open and available

341
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
where you don't get that on some other open source hardware.

342
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
So I think that is pretty neat as well, that they're opening it up completely.

343
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
So we'll see where it goes, you know?

344
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
We'll put a link in the show notes if you are curious yourself.

345
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Really, I like the whole aesthetic overall.

346
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
So even if this one's not for me, I'm excited to see.

347
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Hopefully this project is successful and then we see more things like it.

348
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Yeah, absolutely.

349
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Well, before we go any further, before we get into a big housekeeping

350
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
and before we jump into the future of WSL, how about a round of applause?

351
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Hello to Mr. Big Daddy Linux, Rocco joining us in the Mumba Room.

352
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Hello, Rocco.

353
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Hey, Chris, how are you?

354
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You have perfect timing.

355
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
This is exactly the moment in the show I wanted to mention that this week

356
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
on Rocco's Linux Spotlight, it's my turn.

357
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'll be coming out with a video with Rocco and I chatting about everything.

358
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's great.

359
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
So perfect timing, Rocco.

360
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Welcome to the show.

361
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Well, it didn't feel like perfect timing because I was pretty late,

362
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
but I guess it works out.

363
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
We're just sitting here running our mouths, you know?

364
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It takes us a while to get to the important stuff.

365
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Well, speaking of the important stuff, the interview that we had

366
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
the talk that we had was absolutely awesome.

367
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
If anybody wants to know anything about you and your history,

368
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
we covered pretty much everything from your history into Linux

369
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
to your sysadmin days to a great story on your nightmare scenario.

370
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
That was fabulous.

371
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Well, I really enjoyed it and I appreciated the opportunity

372
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
because the two joys I have on the weekend right now

373
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
are Brunch with Brent and Linux Spotlight.

374
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
So it was great to be able to participate.

375
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
And also, you got to me before Brent did, so congratulations.

376
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Another round of applause on that.

377
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Hey now, hey now.

378
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
But no, it's really a great show.

379
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Jill's been on there.

380
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Jill was on Linux Spotlight and on Brunch with Brent.

381
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,000
And you get a good sort of flavor of people that are talked about a lot

382
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
on these shows across a lot of the different podcasts.

383
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
You'll hear people's names get dropped or mentioned.

384
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
And so this just sort of fills in the background.

385
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm still getting my way through the recent Wimpy episode that's fantastic.

386
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Good to have you here and you're welcome to hang out with us.

387
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
So we're going to be chatting about stuff and all that

388
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
and doing a little housekeeping.

389
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
We have some big news ourselves.

390
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
But so Raka, when does that video come out?

391
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Let's finish that business.

392
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
When's that out and where do people find it?

393
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,000
So you can go to bigdaddylinux.com for the links or the YouTube channel.

394
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
But it comes out Wednesday, December 18th at 6 a.m. Eastern time.

395
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
There you go.

396
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Maybe we'll get an updated link in the show notes when that's out there.

397
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
We can do that.

398
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
We sure can.

399
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Yeah.

400
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
And that's stuff that, you know, if you've been listening for a little bit,

401
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
you may have heard bits and pieces of my history,

402
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
but we never really sat down and put it all in one place either.

403
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
So it's a good opportunity to do that.

404
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Well, now with that said, we do have ourselves a little bit of housekeeping

405
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
to get into this week.

406
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
First of all, a huge announcement.

407
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I am elated to announce – this is my word today, elated.

408
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It's the second usage.

409
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I need a new one.

410
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I am – give me a new one, Wes.

411
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
You don't want to burn words out.

412
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
No, no.

413
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I don't want to say excited because I'm done using excited for the rest of the year.

414
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Jumping for joy.

415
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I'm pretty lazy.

416
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Pretty lazy.

417
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I haven't seen you jump in a while.

418
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Damn it, Wes.

419
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Oh, dang it.

420
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I am –

421
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Thrilled.

422
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Thank you.

423
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Ecstatic.

424
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I am thrilled to announce that a cloud guru at Linux Academy are joining forces as one.

425
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
This is a huge announcement.

426
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
We'll have a link in the show notes to check it out.

427
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
And I'm here to tell you this is going to be great for Linux content.

428
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
This is a huge area of commitment for them going forward.

429
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
As we record a frequently asked questions in the work, put it all together,

430
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
and they'll have that out like later in the week.

431
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
We'll put that in the show notes too.

432
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Yeah, we could do that.

433
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And also, if you just follow on social or check the blogs, a lot of information there.

434
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Huge.

435
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Huge.

436
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
There's a lot more core stuff.

437
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
That's just like massive, but right now, right now it's the holidays.

438
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
So we don't have a lot to say.

439
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
We're going to get through the holidays, and then we'll follow up.

440
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
But we'll have links in the show notes for more information.

441
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Massive.

442
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Talk about a massively growing area too.

443
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
So much stuff going on there.

444
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Now, we have ourselves quite the guest on Brunch with Brent.

445
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Brent, this episode, this episode that you just did with Jason,

446
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
inspired a whole other episode of this program that's coming up soon in the feeds.

447
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
But Jason joined Brent.

448
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Now, Jason, I'm going to go for it, Brent.

449
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I'm going to go for it.

450
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Uh-oh.

451
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
You could do this.

452
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Speziac.

453
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Speziac.

454
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Speziac.

455
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Very good.

456
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I'm sorry, Jason.

457
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I'm sorry.

458
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
There's a bell over there.

459
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
You can ring for us.

460
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Yeah, I got bells.

461
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I got bells for days.

462
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
So Jason.

463
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
You done it.

464
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Jason contacted us and just said, hey, just so you know, I'm watching.

465
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
All right, listen.

466
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Probably doesn't watch, huh?

467
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And I really like the podcast.

468
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
By the way, I do a little bit in the business, and I use Linux to record it.

469
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I'm like, oh yeah, what do you do?

470
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Everything.

471
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Everything.

472
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Jason is a well-established voice actor who's been involved in many cartoons that I cherish

473
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,760
officially, and many other things, including great video games and Hollywood productions.

474
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,300
And he does his work on Linux.

475
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,960
So Brent sat down with a brunch with Jason, and it's so good.

476
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,960
We're doing a two-parter.

477
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,520
So part one is out now.

478
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:11,160
I listened to it on my way in and was like, I had to pause it and write down an idea for

479
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,160
the show just by listening.

480
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,160
It's so great.

481
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,160
It's so good.

482
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,560
Because Jason's really been around for a long time.

483
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,320
He's been a Linux advocate since the early days.

484
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,640
And so there's some trips down nostalgia lane that really, really made me smile.

485
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,680
And then part two is coming out later this week.

486
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,280
It's a two-part brunch.

487
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,120
You guys must have been really full by the end, Brent.

488
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,640
Hey, you got to serve the good stuff for the good guests.

489
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,760
So I pulled out all the stops.

490
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,760
That must have been a thrill, huh?

491
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,760
Yeah.

492
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,320
You know, it was such a treat that he got in contact with us and just said, hey, how

493
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,320
are you guys doing?

494
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,320
I've been listening for a while.

495
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:46,100
And our chat, I knew the moment he and I got connected on the phone to say hello initially

496
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,760
that our chat was going to be really great.

497
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:53,920
And it did not, it totally, brunch was well served, let's put it that way.

498
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,920
Yes.

499
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,040
That's why we're all going to get seconds, right?

500
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,400
I will serve seconds to everyone.

501
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,400
Yeah.

502
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,080
Part two is going to be great too, but part one's out now.

503
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,540
So totally worth checking out.

504
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:07,160
He's hilarious as of course, many voices, but at the same time, just a lot of insight

505
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,360
into the Linux desktop and community.

506
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,120
And he's really put his heart into it.

507
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,820
A deep thinker too.

508
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:17,520
And you get a deep thinker with Brent together and it's magic.

509
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,520
It's magic.

510
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,520
Just take off the rest of the afternoon.

511
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,520
You might as well.

512
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,080
And you may have to pause it and take notes.

513
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,360
So just prepare yourself for that.

514
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,500
But you get that at extras.show.

515
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,900
That's where the brunch with Brent's premiere extras.show.

516
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:33,080
And that one in particks is extras.show slash lucky four zero.

517
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,040
If you want to get that and listen to that.

518
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:40,840
Now I also want to let you know that, uh, our daily Linux news podcast, Linux headlines

519
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:46,060
every single weekday, three minutes or less, all the news that's happening in that day,

520
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,040
it will be off throughout the holiday season.

521
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,320
So you just said every single weekday.

522
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,280
I know I did, didn't I?

523
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,900
With an asterisk, but you just couldn't see it cause it's an audio podcast.

524
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,840
So that's your bad, not mine.

525
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,920
Uh, Monday, December 23rd through Friday, January 3rd, we are taking headlines off.

526
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,800
I just wanted to let you know here because if you're not listening to headlines, then

527
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:10,820
you've made a mistake in your life and I'm not going to point, I won't bring it up again,

528
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:13,040
but now that we've talked about it, you probably should fix it.

529
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,800
So Linux headlines, you got to get that.

530
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,800
All right.

531
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,800
Now we don't need to talk about this again.

532
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,800
Okay.

533
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,800
Done.

534
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,800
It's good.

535
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,120
I think we're all clear on this and just so you know, it's taking some time off and I

536
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,340
forgive you for not listening.

537
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,620
But now that we've talked about this, you're definitely gonna be listening cause it's,

538
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,620
it's a great show.

539
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,040
It's a great show.

540
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,040
Anything else West?

541
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,040
Now that I've shamed everybody.

542
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,040
I don't know.

543
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,040
That got weird.

544
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,040
Yeah.

545
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,040
We better just move on.

546
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,040
I know.

547
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,960
Linux headlines.show for that.

548
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,160
And um, you know, it's the holiday season.

549
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,160
You got to cut me some slack.

550
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,280
That is our holiday housekeeping right there.

551
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,280
It's really festive.

552
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,280
Wes.

553
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,280
I think I just got some marker on my shirt.

554
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,280
Yeah.

555
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,840
There should be lots of good holiday content to keep everyone pleased and we'll be hitting

556
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,320
it hard in the new year.

557
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:57,120
We will be off air live streamies, but we will be on air RSS feedies.

558
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,440
So we will still be posting to the site, to the feeds.

559
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,960
We'll still have content for you because I'm a manic that won't let anybody rest ever.

560
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,960
We can't stop.

561
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,960
No, it's I drink diet coke all day long.

562
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:15,080
We're not sure, but we think if the podcast drops below 55 miles per hour, it'll blow

563
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,800
up.

564
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,800
Also subscribers.

565
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,160
That is part of the equation.

566
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,160
Thank you.

567
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:25,160
Also, uh, thank you to everybody who came to the new live stream time.

568
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:31,640
You know, uh, I was really kind of worked up about it because a bedrock aspect of this

569
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,440
show is our virtual lug and our chat room.

570
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,840
And so I fought tooth and nail for many years not to ever change the time, but there's just

571
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:45,160
a lot of factors and including, and everyone on the team knows this now.

572
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,160
It's so funny.

573
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:50,200
You guys all know me so well now I am just sharper and more with it earlier in the day

574
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,200
than I am in the afternoon.

575
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,880
I'm an old man and by about two, three o'clock I'm not on my game anymore.

576
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,880
Right.

577
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,440
And we tried the nap live stream and it just didn't perform.

578
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,400
So the new lifetimes worked out really well and I just really appreciate everyone who's

579
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,240
come over to jblive.tv on a Tuesday.

580
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,920
We recognize you have to take time out and it means a lot when you show up.

581
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,920
It does.

582
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:14,080
Uh, and we can get that in your time zone at jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar.

583
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,840
And of course there's the IRC room, which is also a huge part of this, that chat room.

584
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,840
Wes and I are reading the entire time the show is going at just like Alex and cheese

585
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,840
and everybody else's.

586
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,680
We're watching that as we go and they're absolutely a fundamental part of the show.

587
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,740
Our titles come from our chat room.

588
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:35,360
So this is my last live show of 2019 and everything else after this will be prerecorded.

589
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,020
So I just wanted to take this opportunity and say thank you so much because it really

590
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:42,040
does make this show and I hope you can join us in 2020.

591
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:49,080
Now with that said, let's transition into a little future casting for 2020 because Wes

592
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:53,320
and I have been reading the tea leaves, watching the industry news, and we've seen a lot of

593
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:59,240
hubbub development around the windows subsystem for Linux, especially since version two lands

594
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,480
in early 2020.

595
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:07,300
And with that, there is industry support forming, including Canonical has made a strategic hire.

596
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:11,720
They've opened another position and they have declared that WSL is an official platform

597
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:17,200
that they will support much like AWS, as well as a few other key industry players and a

598
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,800
big event is all just around the corner.

599
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:24,000
So this seemed like the perfect moment after a year and change to bring Hayden Barnes back

600
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,440
on the show and see what's going on and what big changes have happened in his life.

601
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,520
Well Hayden, welcome back to the program.

602
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,200
Thank you for having me on Linux Unplugged again, this is great.

603
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,960
So a lot of has changed since we chatted, but I think the last time we were on, it might

604
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,480
have been with your chat with Joe talking about Penguin at the time, right?

605
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,740
I think now it's actually called the, it's out, it's like WSL Linux.

606
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,280
It's called WSL Linux now, right?

607
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,080
Or do we swap it to Penguin?

608
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,080
Fill me in.

609
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,640
It was WLinux and then we became Penguin.

610
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,760
Got you.

611
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:59,640
You can tell I'm not a big Windows user, but I'm fascinated about the potential of WSL,

612
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,040
especially version two.

613
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:06,760
And I understand you've had a bit of a job change too since the last time we talked.

614
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,760
I have.

615
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:13,200
I've recently joined Canonical as the developer advocate for Ubuntu on WSL and Hyper-V.

616
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,020
That's great.

617
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:21,100
But to me it also seems to speak to a much larger commitment on Canonical's part to the

618
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,080
Windows subsystem for Linux.

619
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,680
That must have been a surprising conversation when that started.

620
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,680
It was.

621
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:32,840
Canonical is leveling up on WSL, devoting more resources to it, more advocacy, more

622
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:37,600
engineering, certainly more than any other mainstream Linux distribution.

623
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:44,080
Do you think it's the transition to WSL2 and the KVM backend that made it just such a clearly

624
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,680
viable platform for them, or is it just simply the reach?

625
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,240
What are your thoughts on that part of it?

626
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:56,240
Well, it's the opportunity to engage new Linux users, and that's what WSL is.

627
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,340
It's an onboarding experience into the Linux ecosystem.

628
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:05,480
Not necessarily desktop Linux, although some of our users do go there, but to Linux on

629
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:09,360
server, Linux on IoT, Linux on mobile.

630
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:19,800
But seeing the commitment to WSL from Microsoft with WSL2, which is powered by Hyper-V, certainly

631
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:24,480
I think helped Canonical make that decision that this is a platform they wanted to continue

632
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,360
investing in and growing.

633
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,360
That's great.

634
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,260
I think it's pretty clever on Canonical's part.

635
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:35,560
That's very insightful because there's a bit of a barrier to get over to look at this and

636
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,560
say, this is something we could make an official platform.

637
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:43,220
We could target it like we do AWS and really see an opportunity there.

638
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,320
How has it been on the other end of that?

639
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:50,120
Working with Microsoft on things that are maybe a little esoteric or affect only a single

640
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:55,600
distribution or implementation of Linux on WSL, how receptive are they to this large

641
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,600
company?

642
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,840
WSL is just a small part of a much bigger product for them.

643
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:05,120
Do you end up talking to a wall or have you seen reception to concerns and issues and

644
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,280
fixes and things like that?

645
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:12,080
Microsoft is incredibly receptive to everything that we've asked of them.

646
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:19,000
Adding new features, supporting, helping us track down bugs, whether we were at Penguin

647
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,520
or here at Ubuntu, the team on the WSL team have been amazing.

648
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:29,800
I actually worked with several different teams at Microsoft on various projects and every

649
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:35,240
single one of them has been incredibly positive, incredibly receptive to collaboration.

650
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,120
Is people involved in WSL across teams in Microsoft, across multiple teams?

651
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:45,760
Well, I don't just work with WSL, I also work on Hyper-V and we have some other friends

652
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,600
at Microsoft and other areas we collaborate on.

653
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:53,560
I've been part of those conversations as well and it's been great.

654
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:59,660
There's a lot of opportunity for collaboration and there's some that people might be aware

655
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:06,960
of like the Skype Snap in the Snap store, Azure Storage Explorer is there.

656
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,680
We hope to bring teams there shortly.

657
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:15,480
What people don't realize is that the default Linux images, GitHub actions are Ubuntu and

658
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:20,720
that's something developed between Canonical and Microsoft.

659
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:25,080
Really collaboration between Canonical and Microsoft is nothing new, this is just a new

660
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,280
entry point and how that works.

661
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,800
It seems to be somewhat of a growth of an ongoing thing that's benefited both companies.

662
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:38,260
But the reason I was asking you about the specifics of that is just simply I've known

663
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:43,200
Microsoft basically my entire life growing up here in the Redmond area and there are

664
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:49,760
times when a company will launch the initiative and they will not properly staff it and they

665
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,760
will not respond to requests and emails, they wouldn't cooperate with the community simply

666
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,360
because they didn't have the time.

667
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,640
Then there's other initiatives, which it sounds like these are among them, where they have

668
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:03,240
properly staffed them and supported them and made them a priority within the company.

669
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,480
I think that speaks pretty good to the future of that thing.

670
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,480
I think it's pretty clever, like I said earlier, to expand that.

671
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,640
That kind of leads me to the conference.

672
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:17,920
There's an actual WSL conference in the works, what can you tell me about that?

673
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,200
That's WSL Conf, it's scheduled March 10th and 11th.

674
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:27,320
Our first conference will be at Redmond on the campus of Microsoft headquarters.

675
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:33,320
That is a conference I began organizing for my position at Penguin and I brought it over

676
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,120
with me to Canonical.

677
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:42,040
It is sponsored by Canonical and hosted by Microsoft and we are gathering for two days

678
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:48,080
and it is shaping up to be two days of just incredibly intense informational sessions

679
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:55,480
and workshops on what everyone is doing on WSL, things you can accomplish on WSL, web

680
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:01,920
development, IoT, InfoSec, Kubernetes, so much Kubernetes.

681
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,920
Wow.

682
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,920
Yeah.

683
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,920
Good.

684
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,160
Wes and I have registered and we have our press passes, so we'll be there.

685
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,160
Yeah, looking forward to it.

686
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,160
Yeah, absolutely.

687
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,440
I am curious with your new position though, what's going on with Penguin?

688
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,600
Is that still actively being developed?

689
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,600
It is.

690
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:23,920
The goal with Penguin and the startup around at Whitewater Foundry was to create an independent,

691
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:30,080
sustainable, open source startup and I think we definitely met that goal.

692
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:39,300
It had a revenue stream, it has now continued on through leadership change and it was profitable

693
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,360
from day one.

694
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:46,580
In terms of this ongoing discussion we've been having in open source about funding development

695
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:54,560
and I think we've added something to that showing how stores can contribute to that

696
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,280
and solve some of those issues.

697
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:03,080
So it's continuing now, one of the team members, Carlos Ramirez, who's a former contributor

698
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,600
to Wine, has taken over the leadership position.

699
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:12,040
They've published a complete roadmap for 2020 and we had products in the pipeline when I

700
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:17,840
made the leap and those have since launched, including Raft, which is the GUI management

701
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:21,720
tool for WSL distros for Windows 10.

702
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,720
Well that's really neat.

703
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,800
It's nice to see that it's sustainable and that Penguin's going to stick around for a

704
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,400
while and we can keep getting benefit out of that.

705
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,880
And they're going to continue developing the Fedora Remix for WSL as well.

706
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,840
They're going to be able to put more resources into that than we were able to under my leadership.

707
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,320
So they're growing and expanding.

708
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:49,720
So that switch to Canonical, we proved a point in that you could build this sustainable independent

709
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:54,220
open source startup and that we met that goal.

710
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:59,040
And then we also wanted WSL to be taken more seriously by the major players and we certainly

711
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,400
met that goal.

712
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,880
So I felt comfortable moving on from that position.

713
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,960
We never needed a big buyout or anything because we never took any VC money.

714
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,520
It was always funded by the users.

715
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:15,240
But I can move now to Canonical and from this position I have more resources and a bigger

716
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:20,320
platform to continue advocating for WSL and WSL users.

717
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:26,560
And bring all of that experience to one of the world's largest operating systems.

718
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,840
It's really a fantastic kind of move on, not just your part but their part too.

719
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:35,840
So looking at your crystal ball since you have access and control to everything that

720
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,040
will happen with WSL, no questions asked obviously.

721
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:43,080
Where do you see things going in 2020 for this thing that a lot of us are still trying

722
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,080
to wrap our heads around?

723
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:51,960
Well, for most users, 2020 is when WSL 2 will launch, which is the WSL that's powered by

724
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,280
Hyper-V components.

725
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:59,040
It's not required like Hyper-V Manager is on Pro, it will work across all SKUs of Windows

726
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:06,220
10, but it's there and it is powered by a Linux kernel.

727
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:09,040
So you get performance improvements.

728
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,560
This was a major architecture overhaul in V2.

729
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,000
Yeah, you just do much cooler things.

730
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,080
So 2020 is when that will launch for most users.

731
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:21,720
It's available now in the fast and the slow ring for Windows 10.

732
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,280
Of course, of course.

733
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,840
But that will hopefully be launching in the spring.

734
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:33,640
And then here at Ubuntu, we have some interesting ideas that we hope to implement in our distro

735
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,120
in 2020.

736
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,120
We're seeing on that.

737
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,960
I love to hear that.

738
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,200
Maybe maybe a peekaboo at WSL Conf.

739
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,840
I mean, I'm just saying going to be in the area.

740
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,840
We'll see.

741
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,840
Yeah.

742
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,840
Okay.

743
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,840
Okay.

744
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:51,040
Well, Hayden, I really appreciate your patience as I work through understanding this, because

745
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,280
I'm very excited about the potential of it.

746
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,520
And you are really good at explaining it to me and obviously have a great depth of knowledge

747
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,520
with it.

748
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,520
A passionate advocate.

749
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,520
Thank you so much.

750
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,520
Yeah.

751
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,520
So do keep us in the loop as stuff develops too.

752
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,760
And can't wait to shake hands at WSL Conf.

753
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,200
Really looking forward to it.

754
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:14,280
Thank you for coming and giving Penguin that initial boost by having us on Linux Unplugged

755
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:19,400
and Jupyter broadcasting podcasts and for joining us as this journey continues.

756
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,640
Hey, man, you bet.

757
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,880
We recognize we know good work when we see it.

758
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,880
Absolutely.

759
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,880
We got an eye for quality.

760
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,920
But also, you should know that Kali Linux is going to be there and Penguin is going

761
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,920
to be there.

762
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,080
So it's everyone is going to be there.

763
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,800
The registration is going to probably fill up soon.

764
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,000
We're working on a live stream option for people who can't make it to Redmond.

765
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
That's great.

766
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
If that does materialize, do let us know.

767
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,040
We'll try to let people out there know about it.

768
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,040
Sure.

769
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,400
If you want to do the live stream, you can go ahead and register instead of registering

770
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,480
general admission, register live stream online.

771
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,960
Good to know.

772
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,960
Good to know.

773
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,720
Well, I have links to that in the show notes.

774
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,300
Hayden, good to chat with you again.

775
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,300
Thank you.

776
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,300
Thank you so much.

777
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,680
I'm excited about the conference because it's here in our backyard, first of all, so not

778
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,680
much travel required.

779
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,440
Yeah, really, we have to go.

780
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,880
Well, I don't know about that.

781
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:16,480
But it was really good to hear from Hayden and get a little update on where that's at.

782
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:22,120
I got to be honest, when I'm chatting with him, my Windows 10, my Windows ignorance kind

783
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,120
of starts to show.

784
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,760
It's been a long time.

785
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,400
Almost motivated enough to try it.

786
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,440
But I gave it a go a while back and that was enough for me.

787
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,760
I know it's difficult when you already have all the Linux you need and want right in front

788
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,760
of you.

789
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,160
But it is nice to see that it's getting easier and easier to have that even if you have to

790
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,000
use or want to use Windows for other parts of your life.

791
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I'd like to see you take a Windows challenge.

792
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,080
Oh my gosh, I've done it once for Coder.

793
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:49,400
So I have done it.

794
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:54,080
I'm shocked that WSL 2 isn't out there for everybody yet because I feel like it was at

795
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,200
the beginning of this year we tried it.

796
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,560
So it's just not my cup of tea.

797
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,080
I can appreciate people like it.

798
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,080
It's just not my cup of tea.

799
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,400
It's not for me.

800
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:07,320
But the thing he said in that interview that jumped out at me and I noticed it jumped out

801
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:13,560
at you too was when we asked him, what's Canonical's like motivation here?

802
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:19,360
And he said, we want to get to the Linux users that are using WSL.

803
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:22,120
They see it as a whole new generation of Linux users.

804
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,480
Well, and that kind of reminded me of what we were talking about when we talked about

805
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,480
this before from the Microsoft world, right?

806
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,320
Where it's also sort of onboarding for Azure, which is running Linux.

807
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:33,760
And so it's just when you have it at hand, when you can use it right there on your system,

808
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,800
you can easily pivot and jump to other ecosystems.

809
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,800
Huh.

810
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,800
Huh.

811
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,800
That's what I say.

812
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,320
I think it's a good move.

813
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,760
Well, I'll tell you what, the cafeteria at that venue looks awesome.

814
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,440
You'll have to let me know how the food is.

815
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:54,220
You know, if Microsoft's involved, the chances are that the cafeteria is pretty good.

816
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,360
That's for sure.

817
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,360
They know how to eat over there.

818
00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:00,080
I think it's a test of our sort of pragmatism sometimes as a community too, because it is

819
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,080
weird.

820
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,360
I mean, you mentioned even in the interview that we're still, you know, wrapping your

821
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:08,280
head around what it is, but I think so far it's clear, like when you talk to Hayden and

822
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,720
other people who use it and are involved, these are the same, these are the same folks

823
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,720
who love Linux.

824
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,480
There's just another platform.

825
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,680
We're going to get into this more next week.

826
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:21,240
But and Jason talks about this too and his brunch with Brent in a way that really made

827
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,480
me recollect a little bit.

828
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,040
It's just, I made a statement in this week's Linux Action News that is, it's really kind

829
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,160
of stuck with a lot of people.

830
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,880
I've gotten a lot of comments about it and I've thought about it a few times since I

831
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:38,880
said it, but I had this really weird realization while we were recording that my desktop right

832
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,800
now is better because of Microsoft.

833
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,440
My Linux desktop is better because of Microsoft.

834
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,800
I really like Visual Studio Code.

835
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,800
It's nice.

836
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,800
It's cute.

837
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,800
It's cool, which I'm thrilled about.

838
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:56,040
I mean, I like VS Code too.

839
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,040
It's the holidays, Wes.

840
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,040
I'm sorry.

841
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,040
I know.

842
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,040
Some things are sacred.

843
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:03,480
I still SSH on the systems and you've aliased nano to vim.

844
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,280
Oh, Wes, I love you.

845
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:10,160
The only pleasure I get from it, from it all, is watching you struggle every time you sit

846
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:14,600
down on a system that doesn't have vim and you type vim over and over and over.

847
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:17,240
It's just what my brain reaches for when I need to change a file.

848
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:22,360
The great thing is on systems where vim is installed, generally Vi is automatically aliased

849
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:26,600
to vim, so you could have just taught yourself Vi all along and you'd be good to go on any

850
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,600
system.

851
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,600
I know.

852
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,840
The fingers do what they want.

853
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:30,920
And it never ends.

854
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:31,920
It's great.

855
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:39,480
So I get mine, but I really have no words for this whole thing, this whole phenomenon,

856
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:45,160
this whole WSL on Windows and how the numbers are getting ridiculous.

857
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:49,020
But I'm being told numbers by certain developers that seem impossible.

858
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,280
So I don't know.

859
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,280
I don't really.

860
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,280
So I'm really curious.

861
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,520
I mean, we know Windows is in all kinds of places, right?

862
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,720
I've been even told that somebody has a million installs.

863
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,720
Wow.

864
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,760
I just don't know if I buy that.

865
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,760
Seems impossible.

866
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:06,160
But I'm sure you can see why Canonical would be interested in having a strong presence

867
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,160
there.

868
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,160
Yeah.

869
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,160
I mean, the Windows base is huge.

870
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,160
So it is a big market.

871
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:15,720
But I think I believe WSL Conf will serve as sort of a catalyst for my brain.

872
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:20,480
Like it'll all kind of crystallize in my brain when we go to WSL Conf.

873
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,480
We shall see.

874
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,480
That'll be coming up.

875
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,320
We have a link to that in the show notes if you're in the area and you want to go.

876
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,360
Or if you're in the area and just want to say hi to Wes and I.

877
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,120
Yeah, we're always up for that.

878
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,120
I mean, I don't know.

879
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,360
It's not, you know, it's not out of the question.

880
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:35,000
We might want to go out to lunch, say hi to a few people.

881
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
We like snacks.

882
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Damn right we do.

883
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
All right.

884
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Let's get into some feedback.

885
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,400
This is what we've been doing here at Linux Unplugged dot com slash contact.

886
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,740
And we got some feedback in about our grub butter fs advice.

887
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:49,980
And I will just say, while we're doing a little follow up feedback here, we just got done

888
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,480
with the big old upgrade.

889
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,480
Get ready for this.

890
00:45:53,480 --> 00:46:06,760
The other day, a new kernel, new wire guard, new ZFS on Linux and a new system D in one

891
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,760
round of updates.

892
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,480
Those are all the things that we use.

893
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:13,640
That's basically I mean, if you add a Docker in there, then that would be the whole system.

894
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:19,300
This was a massive first update in production for our new arch server and Wes Payne.

895
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:24,300
How did it do?

896
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:29,040
Fantastic.

897
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,300
We've got a few little things, mostly ordering issues to iron out between some some containers

898
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,240
that aren't quite starting right.

899
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,240
But I mean, that's it.

900
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,760
And that's just because it's a new system.

901
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,760
So good.

902
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,760
It was so good.

903
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:44,680
And it did the snapshots as the package upgrades before and after were happening.

904
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,720
So I'm very pleased with that.

905
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,380
So two weeks in service still rocking.

906
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:54,580
And we did our first major like upgrade all of the core system components that did break

907
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:57,240
once or once or twice actually on fedora.

908
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:00,160
Sometimes those what would happen is it would install the new kernel.

909
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,520
But the DKMS modules would be for the running kernel at the time of the upgrade.

910
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:07,120
It would reboot and you'd have to reinstall anything that used DKMS and then it would

911
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,520
build against the running kernel.

912
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:14,320
However, if you can't boot because it didn't build the modules, you got a chicken and an

913
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,320
egg.

914
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,320
That's what happened to us.

915
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,520
Anyways, Nikolai writes in.

916
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,480
Hello, Chris and Wes.

917
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:27,600
I run on ButterFS and since Chris's ButterFS nightmare, which was years ago, when I lost

918
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,800
the system to ButterFS, and then it was like right before the episode two, so I came on

919
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:36,920
all guns blazing, just fired up and pissed off like half of the SUSE community.

920
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:37,980
First Ubuntu, then Arch.

921
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:45,280
My current Arch Linux desktop is from May of 2016 with two MVME drives in a RAID 0.

922
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:50,560
I have my server on Arch and ButterFS since October of 2018 with RAID 1.

923
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,880
I use RAID 1 for the system and RAID 10 for my data.

924
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:57,320
I've had no issues with ButterFS.

925
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:01,720
I want to mention that SUSE's grub is patched to boot the default sub volume, which will

926
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,000
be your system after a snap or rollback.

927
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,060
So that's good to know.

928
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:10,360
After you ran snap or rollback and reboot, you should edit it in the grub menu.

929
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,800
He's given us tutorials on how to use the snaps.

930
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,800
Yeah.

931
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:18,760
And you know, it's probably good advice as we as we've mentioned, we have not yet tested

932
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,240
that little safety net.

933
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:24,920
Because what he's saying here is if you don't do this right during a snap or rollback, you'll

934
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,840
end up in a read only system.

935
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,480
And so this is his solution to that.

936
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,040
So if this happens to you, we'll have a link in the show notes for that.

937
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,560
Yeah, we'll have to test a rollback here one of these weeks.

938
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,880
You know what, fair enough.

939
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,960
I brought this on myself when when we decided to use ButterFS.

940
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:43,320
All the people that have been using ButterFS this entire time, they totally earned the

941
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,800
told you so moment, didn't they?

942
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:49,080
So you know what, I'll take your told you so's, go ahead, give them to me.

943
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,080
I earned it.

944
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,080
You're right.

945
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,080
It's fine.

946
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,560
As long as you use it right.

947
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,760
Problem was, I was holding it wrong.

948
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,960
I acknowledge it now.

949
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:56,960
It's not your fault.

950
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,640
It's not ButterFS's fault.

951
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,080
It's my fault for holding ButterFS wrong.

952
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:05,960
All right, Wes, do you want to read this second email that comes into the old show skis here?

953
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,460
Oh, it's not an email.

954
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:08,460
It's a feedback on Reddit.

955
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:11,460
I haven't mentioned the subreddit in about 15 years.

956
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:17,440
They're still out there from six from now Dooley Dooley writes in five days ago to the

957
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,440
show.

958
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:22,920
No, don't do this with CFS, NFS, Libver, D, Docker.

959
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:27,280
You have way too many low level moving parts to juggle.

960
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,840
March is going to be a constant nightmare.

961
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:34,480
I stick with my original recommendation of Debian or CentOS.

962
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,320
Hearing about the struggles with Fedora is no surprise.

963
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:42,600
Oh, there's a whole new wing of I told you so's in the waiting.

964
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:48,880
I won't lie, when I told Jim of TechSnap about it, he rolled his eyes.

965
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,920
I mean, I couldn't see, but I could hear the eye roll over the microphone.

966
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,720
I mean, I want to remind everyone, the premise here is we're doing this so you don't have

967
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:57,720
to.

968
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,340
We know this is not necessarily a good idea.

969
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:01,720
We are testing a theory.

970
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:06,760
If you take a belt and suspenders approach to arch and you build a simple system, is

971
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,720
it maintainable over the long term?

972
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:13,080
Now what I like about this is what Dooley is saying is you haven't built a simple system,

973
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,080
right?

974
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,080
That's his that's his core criticism.

975
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:19,920
He's saying you're using look, guys, you got NFS, you got ZFS, you got Libver, D and you

976
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:20,920
got Docker.

977
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,440
It's too many moving parts.

978
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:25,280
Well, do we have liberty?

979
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,040
We did on the previous system.

980
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,800
We didn't set up any VMs this time.

981
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,800
We don't have any VMs.

982
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,760
So we're only containers on this one.

983
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,760
And then net data on the host.

984
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:39,080
He missed Samba though, so you know, it kind of works out to be the same.

985
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,760
And actually, we haven't set up NFS yet.

986
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:44,920
Now that I think about it, we haven't really needed to because the rare occasions I just

987
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:48,560
connect over Samba now, like a monster, which is fine.

988
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:49,560
It works.

989
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:50,560
Yeah, it's fine.

990
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,800
I think I argue his premise.

991
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,720
I think a Samba ZFS Docker base is not too much.

992
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,640
Yeah, there's enough things that aren't, you know, exceptional, I guess WireGuard out of

993
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,640
the tree.

994
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:02,640
That'll be nice when it goes.

995
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,120
WireGuard on that list, too, right?

996
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,120
Yes.

997
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:09,360
Okay, that ZFS, I feel like ZFS is the biggest outlier is additional complexity in the fact

998
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:14,240
that it's, you know, it's kind of foreign as its own admin style and regime, right?

999
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:18,360
But we're we both used it for a long time, and I think are willing to adopt that.

1000
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,320
I think it's funny.

1001
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:25,880
It's funny because of our perspectives, because you and I and the audience, we really know

1002
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,480
the source material.

1003
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:31,800
But if you're an enterprise user from the outside, they would laugh at us because ZFS

1004
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:35,140
is clearly more safe of a choice than ButterFS.

1005
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:38,920
And here we're arguing that it's the riskier choice, because we're talking about it from

1006
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,080
a kernel modules and update standpoint.

1007
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,700
And they're talking about it from a data integrity standpoint.

1008
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:48,200
And so it's not like we're talking about, you know, Larry's crazy open source project

1009
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,200
here.

1010
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:58,440
We're talking about Samba, Docker, ZFS, like production grade, impacts millions of people

1011
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:01,000
if they screw up kind of thing.

1012
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,780
So yes, it is a bit of a moving risk because there's a lot of pieces in there, but they're

1013
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:08,200
all kind of enterprise grade pieces.

1014
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,840
The other part to the thing we liked about Arch was was the simplicity in that we we

1015
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,820
know exactly what we've installed on the machines.

1016
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:18,200
We have a sense of exactly what we have to maintain and what's what isn't there to move.

1017
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:23,560
It's so simple that both you and I in our head can we have it memorized, how it's set

1018
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:27,420
up, how the partition scheme is laid out and what software is installed just off the top

1019
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:28,420
of our heads.

1020
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:31,340
And I particularly like how simple things like make package, you know, package builds

1021
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:36,300
are in the sense of like if if we have a problem like, you know, the AR AR package goes missing

1022
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:40,280
or isn't maintained anymore, those are all easy to build because they're laid right out

1023
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,280
there.

1024
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,640
We know how to use the tools that make up the distro.

1025
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:45,240
That's I think the key thing.

1026
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:49,020
And that's again, why I go back to we're doing this so you don't have to, because we're comfortable

1027
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:50,300
doing those kinds of things.

1028
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:53,460
We're comfortable booting into a separate operating system and then cherooting in here

1029
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,200
and recovering and repairing it.

1030
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:59,200
We're comfortable reloading kernel modules if they don't load properly after a boot,

1031
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,100
etc, etc.

1032
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:04,200
Most people don't want to fuss with that for good reason.

1033
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:08,400
We want to fuss with this stuff temporarily, at least for a while.

1034
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:13,440
So we can see if there are benefits, because what happened here was, is I said Fedora is

1035
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,920
not a good server OS.

1036
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:20,160
We can't use like like right here, like like Dooley says, I had no surprises hearing about

1037
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,720
the struggles with Fedora.

1038
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,600
No surprise to me.

1039
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,560
That's a stereotype right there.

1040
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:29,080
And I challenged it and we put Fedora on there.

1041
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,080
And it changed the game.

1042
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:34,940
That server went from an idle storage appliance to something that's fundamentally integrated

1043
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:36,880
into our day to day workflow.

1044
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,920
And it changes everything.

1045
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:44,280
And so with that, I learned that I had a incorrect stereotype.

1046
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,560
It was absolutely doable.

1047
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,400
You just had to take the right precautions.

1048
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:52,060
And I thought, well, what's the next big stereotype I have about how you run a Linux server?

1049
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:53,060
And it was Arch.

1050
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:54,120
It's not the distro.

1051
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,120
It's how you use it.

1052
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:58,460
Oh, my God, amazing.

1053
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:02,120
So anyways, Linux Unplugged dot com slash contact.

1054
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,600
Get your feedback in here, because I love having that.

1055
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:07,680
And it's just it's a great source of conversation, too.

1056
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,520
And even if we don't get it on the air, we always read it.

1057
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,520
We do read it.

1058
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:17,800
So Cheezy is going to wrap us up today with a command line utility that will finally allow

1059
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:20,240
you to uninstall your browser forever.

1060
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,240
Absolutely.

1061
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:24,720
But before that, I'd just like to say I think you're still both savages for using Arch on

1062
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:25,720
the server.

1063
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:26,960
I mean, I get it.

1064
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,640
I'm glad that you're doing it.

1065
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,760
Like you said, you're doing it so that I don't have to.

1066
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:33,520
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1067
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:38,840
So look, you know, the thing about Arch is it's just taking Linux to its ultimate conclusion,

1068
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:39,840
isn't it?

1069
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:40,960
It's like the end game.

1070
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:41,960
That's the Linux singularity.

1071
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:42,960
What do you mean?

1072
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,560
Well, you have full control over everything.

1073
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:48,280
You know, if something doesn't work, it's your fault.

1074
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:53,920
You know, with Apple, with a normal distribution, you're almost subscribing to like the Apple

1075
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:58,760
style approach of letting other people make those decisions for you.

1076
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:02,120
But with Arch, if something breaks, it's on you and it's your fault.

1077
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,320
And I kind of like that about it.

1078
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:07,400
There's also and I have a hard time articulating this, so I have not said it on air.

1079
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:12,040
But I've tried to say it to Wes, and he knows what I mean because he's experienced it.

1080
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:16,440
But there is something to the fact that if you're starting from zero, it's often easier

1081
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:19,400
to get going than when you're starting from 80 percent done.

1082
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,400
Right.

1083
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,600
Well, you don't have to discover when you go on some systems, some distro, you're like,

1084
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:24,320
OK, well, I know I need this piece.

1085
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,920
How have they configured it and you configure it?

1086
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,560
It's not configured.

1087
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,000
And you're like, well, where does that matter?

1088
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,400
Well, recently on my workstation, I needed to set up containers and I needed to set up

1089
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,920
virtualization.

1090
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,740
The Arch Wiki is so damn good.

1091
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:41,520
And when you're just when you're starting with nothing, it's just a few commands these

1092
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,040
days to get any of this stuff working.

1093
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:48,400
And you don't have to wonder, like, how do I get it working in this scenario or in this

1094
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,400
configuration?

1095
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:50,400
It's not working.

1096
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,520
So you just turn it on and you set it up.

1097
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:56,600
And it's genuinely simple almost every single time.

1098
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:02,320
And I can't I can't give that like a name or a phrase or I can't put it in like a catchy

1099
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:03,320
way.

1100
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:07,640
But it actually makes setting up complicated services like virtualization and containers

1101
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:12,200
and ZFS and all of that stuff simpler.

1102
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,840
Because you're just starting from a point of zero.

1103
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:15,800
And I know that seems weird.

1104
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:20,480
And I know that if you're if you're new to Linux or you only use GUI tools, that sounds

1105
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,100
like some sort of heebie-jeebie command line nonsense.

1106
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:27,080
But I swear to I swear to I swear to the command line simpler.

1107
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:31,920
And because you always have the latest version of whatever it is, whenever you're looking

1108
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:37,400
at some cool guide or some Reddit post or something else that got you excited about

1109
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,280
doing whatever it is you're doing.

1110
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:42,280
You don't have to go and compile anything because it's already in the repo.

1111
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,280
I will give you that.

1112
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,360
And I will say that I think that ZFS is the silver lining in this.

1113
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:51,140
As long as you don't destroy the pool, I think everything will be perfectly fine.

1114
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:54,560
So it did build the modules correctly before it rebooted.

1115
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:57,240
We had the modules ready to go and we rebooted them right there.

1116
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,240
Exactly.

1117
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,240
All right.

1118
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:04,720
So let's ramp up to a pick that I set up as a really with a completely ridiculous premise

1119
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:05,720
to begin with.

1120
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:06,720
Yeah.

1121
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:12,040
So if you don't need a browser anymore, obviously you still need Wikipedia and maybe on your

1122
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,320
pocket chip computer, you got a terminal.

1123
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,080
Hey, I like it.

1124
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:19,660
So this week's pick is Wicket.

1125
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:23,280
It's written in Node.js and needs to be installed via NPM.

1126
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:27,460
But it's a cool little command line tool.

1127
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:32,920
If you just need to get a summary of a Wikipedia entry, it's super quick.

1128
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:37,760
Wicket and then Linux or Wicket and Arch or Wicket and ZFS, whatever you're looking

1129
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,360
for, you'll be able to pull that out really quick.

1130
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:44,320
So for me, I'm an avid user of Wikipedia.

1131
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,360
I love Wikipedia.

1132
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:51,440
That being said, since it is the holiday season, you should consider if you've used Wikipedia

1133
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:55,800
over the last year, maybe throw in a couple of bucks.

1134
00:57:55,800 --> 00:58:00,320
I think right now they're the average donation of like $2.75 will go a long way.

1135
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:03,620
So check that out and donate if you can.

1136
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:09,160
But Wicket is a great little command line tool that I suggest everyone pick up if they

1137
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,240
are avid Wikipedia readers.

1138
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:13,280
I mean, I just kind of like that.

1139
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:17,140
I might not use it all the time, but it depends on your context when you can keep those context

1140
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:18,140
switches down.

1141
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:20,440
If it means I can just stay in the terminal, look up something real quick and get back

1142
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:21,440
to what I was working on.

1143
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,440
That's great.

1144
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:28,080
So anytime you can do something in a drop down Quake style terminal, you gain a couple

1145
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,080
of cool points.

1146
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:30,080
Oh yeah, instant nerd cred.

1147
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,080
Just Wicket.

1148
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,080
Wicket real good.

1149
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,080
Just Wicket.

1150
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,080
Good pick, Cheesy.

1151
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,080
Thank you.

1152
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,080
That's pretty neat.

1153
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,080
All right.

1154
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:40,760
Well, I think that brings us to the end of this week's Unplugged program.

1155
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:44,480
I say go get some more Wes Payne and Jim Salter.

1156
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:49,400
Jim also writes for Ars Technica, so he's got a bunch of great posts over there.

1157
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:54,600
I think Jim has a nice level-headed take on the recent Librem 5 developments, and he finally

1158
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,720
gave the Eero Wi-Fi system a go.

1159
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:57,720
I know, wasn't that great?

1160
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:58,720
He likes it.

1161
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,200
It was satisfying to hear because I've been waiting for him to review the Eero Wi-Fi because

1162
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:08,100
it's such a weird product because of that cloud dependency, but yet such a solid freaking

1163
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:09,160
Wi-Fi network.

1164
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,160
It's so frustrating.

1165
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,160
You can't argue with performance.

1166
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:12,160
You can't.

1167
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,440
So go get more of that at TechSnap.Systems.

1168
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:19,800
And of course, you've got to get some brunch, extras.show.40.

1169
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,400
Go listen to part one.

1170
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,080
It got my wheels turning.

1171
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:26,100
And if you've been around for a little while, it'll get you really nostalgic.

1172
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:32,000
And if you've missed the early days of Linux, it'll fill you in on some really great edge

1173
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
pieces of history.

1174
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,940
So check that out at extras.show.40.

1175
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:41,280
And last but not least, go check out my spotlight with Rocco, his YouTube channel, Big Daddy

1176
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:44,760
Linux coming out on Wednesday right after the show goes live.

1177
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:47,600
Thanks so much for joining us on this here Unplugged program.

1178
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:48,920
We won't be live next Tuesday.

1179
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,680
We'll have an episode for you.

1180
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:53,920
So have a great holiday and we'll see you live back here January.

1181
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:54,920
Sounds like a beagle.

1182
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:55,920
Are you sick?

1183
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:24,920
Wounded?

1184
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:44,160
The Drifter in the chatroom massive will review last year's predictions.

1185
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,760
You bet.

1186
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,200
We've got new predictions in the can.

1187
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:49,200
We've got a review.

1188
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,200
I hope I do better this year.

1189
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:53,400
Yeah, that will be coming out over the holiday season.

1190
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:58,640
And there's like, I know there's a couple of wins in there, but I was just reviewing

1191
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:02,840
them and there's also some embarrassing calls.

1192
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,040
You had a really bold one.

1193
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,040
I don't know if you remember.

1194
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,040
I do.

1195
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:07,040
Yeah.

1196
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,040
Yeah.

1197
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,040
So that's coming up.

1198
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,040
Yeah, that'll be in a very future episode.

1199
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:12,440
You got to go big and then eventually you go home anyway.

1200
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:13,440
Yeah.

1201
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,440
Yeah.

1202
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:15,440
You went big.

1203
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,160
Also, there's one where you got like unusually, you and I both did this once where we got

1204
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:21,240
like really hyper specific, which I don't know why we did that.

1205
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:26,200
I thought the judge sort of required that he was a little bit of a judge with a strong

1206
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,200
ruling hammer.

1207
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,200
Which is good.

1208
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:29,200
We want that in the judge.

1209
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,200
Bang, bang, bang.

1210
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:51,600
Oh, Joe.
