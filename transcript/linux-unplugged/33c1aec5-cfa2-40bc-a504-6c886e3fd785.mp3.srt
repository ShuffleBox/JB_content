1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
So it went up on you know the free software foundation is doing a big fundraiser right now

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,920
They've raised a lot of money, but they're trying to get to five hundred and twenty five thousand dollars now

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,560
They're at two hundred forty eight thousand dollars. That's not bad

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,060
What's what what what are they gonna do with that money?

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,000
Well, they it's their biggest fundraising event of the year

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,920
They have a lot of work to do and this video makes the case for the work

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,240
They have to do this video Popey the value of this is negative

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,040
No, no, the value of this video is not negative this video that I'm about to play for you

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,840
We'll tell you what they're gonna do with that money. They're gonna explain to you why you want to spend that money

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,440
Are you are you ready?

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,800
Feeling are you feeling while it downloads? No, it's downloaded now. Here we go

12
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:47,200
Software is all around us and sometimes inside us

13
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,240
But what happens when the tools we use are obeying someone else a

14
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,980
Tool you control serves your interests

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,600
But if someone else controls it

16
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,400
They serve their own

17
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,980
When you can examine tools to see how they work you're able to learn about them

18
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,440
Even modify them to work differently or better

19
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,760
When you can share a tool and its changes you help others and in turn they help you

20
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,500
In fact, this is how early computing developed

21
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,280
Everyone could see a program's code and people shared their work freely to drive its growth

22
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,480
Every user was a potential author

23
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,160
But when companies began to lock source code away

24
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:47,400
It stopped being possible to participate or even to know what the code was doing in

25
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:56,240
Response hackers formed the GNU project to create a computer system designed to respect the autonomy of users

26
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:05,560
They adopted a copyleft maneuver and built it into the GNU general public license a legal structure that preserves user rights

27
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:12,000
In ten short years the free software movement had produced the GNU Linux system

28
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,280
Computing that nobody could own but anyone could use

29
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,260
Today it's keeping planes in the air stocks trading

30
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,200
And the global internet running

31
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:32,840
We all encounter free software in invisible ways

32
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,160
But software freedom was designed for people

33
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:43,840
It's about what shape the technology we inhabit will take and what kind of society we use our digital powers to build

34
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,840
And

35
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,200
We've still got work to do

36
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,000
Make the future and they show cross going across the screen a bunch of Linux desktop activities making art

37
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,120
Using some of the best free software out there

38
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:15,880
And it ends with 30 years of people of propelling user freedom the free software foundation 30 years of propelling user freedom

39
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,360
Join us contribute and learn more

40
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,060
Interestingly, I recognized one of the faces at the very end when it flicks around it was

41
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,760
Jacob Applebaum from the tool project. Yeah in the video they were playing. Yeah

42
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,240
So that's what they want to use the money for that they and you know

43
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,720
You got oh, you got a kind of applaud

44
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,400
I mean, that's a really well done video and it does help kind of explain what the idea is here that

45
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,720
There is a new form of expression that is being locked away and the free software foundation wants to free it

46
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,960
But they need support to do it. Hope we though you sound skeptical about where that money would go

47
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:55,840
Well, no in the past I've been skeptical and that video doesn't actually say what the money

48
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,960
And in the past many of the free software

49
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,920
Foundation campaigns have been highly suspects like the

50
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,320
Doing a denial of service attack on genius bar people in Apple stores. That was just moronic

51
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,040
And they had a whole load of campaigns against Windows that were just ridiculous

52
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,120
And so there was a lot of negative campaigning about proprietary software

53
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,560
But not enough positive campaigning about the virtues of free software

54
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,840
And I don't I think I think actually personally I think since Matt Lee left he was behind some of those campaigns

55
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,800
I think they've turned around and they're doing more positive things. Yeah, this seem more positive and you know the it wraps

56
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,320
with a free software user just

57
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,960
Ripping through a whole bunch of really great free software apps now like with that video what I kind of thought about when I saw

58
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,700
That video is oh, yeah

59
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,920
We do have a ton of really good like just great apps now

60
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:59,560
I was talking to Michael Dominic from Kota radio. I said so how's your switch to Ubuntu going?

61
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,560
And he was he's like well

62
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,880
You know truth be truth be told chrome is chrome and sublime text is sublime text and I need a terminal and it's working pretty

63
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,020
Well, but I like it for everybody. It's something else like for him

64
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,400
It's sublime text, but for somebody else is another application, and there just is more and more of them

65
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:23,120
You know for me a really big change for 2014 is I managed to start editing the clips for unfilter

66
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:29,320
Under Linux and doing it in a way that was better than I could accomplish the same task under OS 10 and for me

67
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,360
That was a really really important moment because for a long time

68
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,440
I've been able to accomplish a lot of the stuff with way more time and frustration under Linux now

69
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,560
I'm not talking full editing, but there's a specific use case that I have for clips and unfilter that is

70
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,640
Now it's better under Linux and lets me do more stuff

71
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,040
Thanks to just some of the great apps that are available and so I think this video what they showed there at the end

72
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,160
I was like, oh, yeah, that's awesome. That's great. So watching this back

73
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,960
I'm like, this is a more positive free software foundation and it made me think more about

74
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,040
their larger mission

75
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,160
Without them having to come and put their larger mission right up in my face hole and saying this is what we're trying to do

76
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,520
And I I felt like I don't I thought it was a good attempt

77
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,840
Yeah, it's great video. It's good. It doesn't really say anything new to any of us

78
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,840
Yeah, it's a good way to get the message out to normals. Yeah

79
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:25,080
And and it was well produced to which appreciate. Yep. I'm looking to see they don't take Bitcoin though

80
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,840
Sorry poppy you're out

81
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,440
Yeah, I know you were looking forward to that

82
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,880
But they would take PayPal. Oh, no, never mind. You can do Bitcoin. I'm sorry. I'm sorry

83
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,800
You just can't do it through this campaign. You can just donate you could donate of course

84
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,740
Oh, yeah, they've been taking Bitcoin donations for a long time

85
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,960
But if you want to contribute directly to this fundraiser, it doesn't look like you can use Bitcoin

86
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:52,520
So poppy, maybe I can tempt you into Bitcoin. You need to go and look up coin corner coin corner

87
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:59,840
Yeah, it's a Bitcoin exchange in the Isle of Man, which I know it's very popular with somebody close to poppy

88
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,800
Oh, oh, it might be might be a thing. Yeah, so it's a good it's a good exchange

89
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,800
Sure, you can also oh you buried the lead wimpy. You can also buy and sell toes

90
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:15,440
So yeah and like coin as well

91
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:23,520
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that never ever provides financial advice

92
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:29,880
My name is Chris. My name is Matt Matt. So episode 73 and we're doing it on December 30th

93
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,020
2014 and last Sunday

94
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:38,080
We had our chance to look into our action crystal balls and try to figure out what was gonna happen in the world of Linux

95
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:44,000
A little behind-the-scene bit of information though that people may or may not be aware of especially if you didn't watch live

96
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,760
That wasn't what we planned on doing that episode

97
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,800
In fact, I think I'll check the show notes. You can probably get an idea of what we had planned to cover

98
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,560
But things just sometimes with guests don't work out and you got to work

99
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,880
You know, you got it. You got to work with that situation. You got to move on your feet

100
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,640
You got a pivot as they say that's what they say Matt. They say pivot pivot always

101
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,320
You got a pivot and so what Matt and I did is we pivoted

102
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,280
And we just kind of came up with our 2015 predictions

103
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,800
Literally on the fly as the bits were being committed to disk. We hadn't we didn't we didn't have a chance to think ahead

104
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,200
really brainstorm

105
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,140
Get in our zone, but now here we are episode 73 of the Linux unplugged program

106
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,880
we are gonna be joined up by our

107
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:27,680
Virtual Linux users group and we are going to bounce off each other the best set of 2015 predictions

108
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,560
You will find anywhere on the internet for what is going to happen in Linux and how do I know that?

109
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,560
Because I have faith in the people that we have assembled our mumble

110
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:41,800
I have faith you might say of the heart and I think that probably be the best time to bring in the mumble room time

111
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,800
appropriate greetings mumble room

112
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,480
Really

113
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,880
Nobody got the enterprise. So that happened. Oh, I'm sorry. I know it's the end. It's a holiday season man. I can't help it

114
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:02,000
I always drop in Star Trek. Yeah, so we got it. We got it. I got I got I got a new bag of

115
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,280
Balls that I brought that I'll pull out a few and rub and get some predictions out of I know the moment rooms got

116
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,920
Some we already blew a few during the pre-show that we didn't mean to because I didn't have the record button going

117
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,920
I blame wimpy and so

118
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,440
And so what we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna have a bunch of good ones and I want to start though

119
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,160
With some follow-up Linux unplugged shows all about the follow-up

120
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,080
And the continuity if you will and I got to talk about telegram and Matt

121
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,080
I love it cuz I know you sussed this one out

122
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,020
Well, you saw in the subreddit. We were gonna have ourselves a bit of a problem with the telegram app pick

123
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:39,320
Just a little bit. Yeah, I basically dropped in said hey guys, you don't care no stickers. I'm good. I walked away

124
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,480
Just before the s-storm starts I'm just gonna lay this out there and I'm out

125
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:52,040
I'm not coming back. I'm not coming back in this and that was wise and here's what happened is Chris got all excited about something

126
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,000
and

127
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,780
He talked about it and it was telegram and I got so excited about telegram

128
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:04,120
That I actually even gave out my my contact information on telegram. Oh, that was great

129
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:11,360
No, no, no, no, it's cool, you know, I've enjoyed talking to everybody it's been great

130
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:19,080
Really have I got some actually my favorite one so far as I got some snow pictures from Australia. Oh, well, that's kind of cool

131
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,380
Okay. Yeah, so Australia's got snow. I didn't even know that was a thing

132
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:28,440
And now I've got a picture in telegram about it now telegram for those of you who didn't watch the world's largest Linux podcast

133
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,900
That is a secure instant messaging program that promises the entire world when it comes to security

134
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,400
And we've been using something called Viber. Yeah for Jupiter broadcasting production purposes

135
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:46,280
And and Viber kind of does the same thing if you're familiar with WhatsApp or hangouts or any of this thing kind of stuff

136
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:53,520
You get the idea they each have their varying levels of features a couple of core fundamentals that we have here

137
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,840
And I'll just super quick because I know I'm retreading ground here and then we'll get into the telegram stuff because I think it's important

138
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,080
our requirements are

139
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,340
Mobile really has to be

140
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,360
Just as supported if not the most supported and that's feels even dirty just saying that because I'm not that guy

141
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,280
I'm all about the desktop

142
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,440
but the fact is our production teams literally all over the world and

143
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:20,720
They are oftentimes the majority of them or at least a significant portion of them are only available at that moment via their mobile

144
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,720
So that's sort of right there sets our limitations of what our mediums are what our end devices are for communication

145
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,180
And when you think of mobile you got to think about all of the restrictions therein

146
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,100
they're also because there are producers there at FES and conferences and the

147
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,660
Network at FES and conferences are notoriously bad

148
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:45,200
Which means connectivity is always in a state of flux and you need to know if somebody sent a message and receive that message

149
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,400
You need to know if the service acknowledges that you were able to transmit that message because your connectivity can be so fluctuating

150
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:56,880
So that's a requirement we have from a messaging program. And then of course because it's the Linux action shown Linux unplugged mandatory

151
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,120
It's got to run on Linux, right?

152
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,800
We got to be able to have a Linux client because some of our back-end staff are on Macs

153
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,000
Well to you got to have the Mac client, right?

154
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,180
So you it's you you you you start to then of course, there's gonna be some people that need Windows. I don't know

155
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,600
Probably rotten corpse wants it on Windows or something. I don't know

156
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,200
On top of all of that then there's the features of that client

157
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,160
Can it send pictures pictures are necessary because sometimes we just like to have fun

158
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,860
Sometimes we got to send a picture of the booth what it looks like right?

159
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,880
Can it send voice memos sometimes that's important because people are driving or you're giving something very complicated

160
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,400
You don't want to type it all out. So does it do voice back and forth?

161
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,960
there's those kinds of things that are critically important then you get to stuff like

162
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,040
Is it encrypted? Is it private?

163
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,240
If if you came to me and said Chris

164
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:55,640
I believe there was a way that anybody in the Jupiter broadcasting audience could read any telegram thread. I

165
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,420
Almost wouldn't care because there's nothing really in there

166
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:07,320
That's confidential if I wanted to use a confidential messaging platform. Well, I sure as hell wouldn't use somebody else's service, right?

167
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,440
I would go fire up my own XMPP right?

168
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:15,920
I would make sure I'm using a fully open source client to use that XMPP server and to be totally frank

169
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:22,520
Like if I'm super paranoid, I probably don't even use a computer right Matt exactly

170
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,120
Well, that's just it

171
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,640
I mean first and foremost my two rules in life are if it executes code it can be exploited

172
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:34,280
And if it's communication besides actually, I don't know keeping it in your brain. It can be exploited same thing applies

173
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,460
I mean really I mean even paper and pen can be exploited

174
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:40,640
So, I mean, I think a lot of people got to figure out how deep they want to dive into that and in reality

175
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,800
You know, does it use some base level encryption? Yeah, it sounds like it. Okay, cool

176
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,240
All right

177
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,120
So that is where we're coming out from telegram and we got some feedback around telegram

178
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,040
And a lot of it centers around the encryption that telegram uses and wimpy

179
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,420
I wanted to give you a chance to jump in because I know you know about it at contests they have going

180
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,740
Yeah, well, this is the second contest they've run now

181
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:05,020
So they've they've put out a three hundred thousand dollar bounty for somebody that can crack

182
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:10,700
The the encryption on telegram and every so often they keep bumping the value up

183
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,380
So it started at a hundred thousand then it was two hundred thousand now

184
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,780
It's three hundred thousand and they keep on

185
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:22,820
Relaxing the rules of engagement as the bounty goes up and nobody's broken it yet. So they're obviously

186
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:27,380
Fairly confident in in their encryption

187
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:36,220
Yeah, I'm not trying I'm not coming here to advocate for telegram is encryption or one way or the other

188
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,580
because you know it it sounds like from my understanding is

189
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:49,140
They still have the the problem where telegram could hand over in keys and some a third party could get involved in the conversation

190
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:54,900
If not for anything else other than monitoring and beat off on the subreddit writes in he says being the good

191
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,980
Being good. Okay. Here's Paul. Oh, he's taking a shot at me

192
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:04,280
I see he says being good at going full salesman on things comes with a certain responsibility. Apparently. I'm full salesman on telegram

193
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:10,500
If you care about your audience, okay. All right. Thanks. All right. How dare you like a product Chris? What were you thinking?

194
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:16,340
Yeah, come on touting the security of telegram should be avoided by all means use it if it fits your needs

195
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:20,500
But please don't portray telegram as something vetted and secure

196
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:24,100
That's doing the audience a disservice only half of the equation

197
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:28,340
The client is open source and the protocol is full of weirdness and outright flaws

198
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:35,320
I believe their crypto contest charade was even featured and scoffed at on one of the network's channels a while ago

199
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:41,360
Perhaps if its encryption score is the following table then he links to the EFF

200
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,860
He includes the EFF

201
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,100
Or card of secure messaging clients. They did recently and

202
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,060
I'm looking for telegram on the list right here

203
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:59,700
If it's if it's so flawed and they've been offering a hundred thousand two hundred thousand three hundred thousand dollars then

204
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:04,100
That that's enough motivation for people that know their stuff

205
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:10,780
Break it and claim the prize money and that hasn't happened yet. And what I get from these crypto contests

206
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:14,820
I haven't looked into the crypto in any any degree but they're clearly thinking about

207
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,100
Cryptography first rather than an afterthought and it's baked into the product

208
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,900
Yeah, I say telegram

209
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:28,220
They you know, they I'm looking at this core the scorecard here from the EFF has there been a recent code on it

210
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:35,020
They say fail that check mark that checkbox and our past communication secure if your keys are stolen and they don't have that checkbox

211
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:38,340
I would also add I believe the way telegram works is at some level

212
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:42,700
They're storing your messages on their server until all of your clients have downloaded. That's probably something you should be worried about, too

213
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:49,180
You not only that but I mean stepping back to the show and what we actually what you actually said about it specifically

214
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:55,380
I seem to remember the words not open source used open protocol and is reasonably secure

215
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,580
I mean was kind of that, you know, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I don't really under I mean it's like well

216
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:03,700
Okay, so I can't use online banking because that hasn't really been vetted. I sure as hell haven't vetted it

217
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:09,380
I can't use anything with you know, any type of SSL because I personally haven't vetted it and I don't know who does

218
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,780
You know, I mean you can just it just becomes a really ridiculous argument

219
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:17,820
Well, I guess that's kind of where I wanted to take this like if I feature something on the Linux action show like telegram

220
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:24,140
What is my level of responsibility for that disclaiming that kind of stuff? Yeah

221
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:31,040
The fact that hey, I really like this product here's the fact that it's open protocol and we're using it

222
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,780
I think it's kind of you kind of hit all the nails on the head

223
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,900
I think I mean if you really look at it logically, I don't understand how

224
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:44,300
That's unclear. I don't recall you saying that this is NSA quality encryption or you're like, you know

225
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,980
I mean, I guess I'm just confused by the whole thing

226
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:51,300
Well, what is here's some good news and by the way, I will link in the show notes. We've also in the subreddit

227
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:56,380
You know, there was a link to somebody who takes apart some of the some of the issues with the protocol

228
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,900
Which is totally legit

229
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:02,780
It's fine, but there and then somebody also linked and I meant to grab the name

230
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:09,540
I'm sorry a really good stack exchange thread where somebody a hello world goes there

231
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:13,660
I'm really does break down kind of like if you are super super concerned about

232
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:19,620
Really secure chat perfectly secure chat. Here are the things you need to consider

233
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:24,300
some of them are design philosophy things some are just the way the telegram works and

234
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:29,660
Some of them are perhaps key issues and I thought this was a really good article and last but not least

235
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,860
I also was provided a hundred percent open source

236
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,000
Android client for telegram in the f-droid marketplace or whatever you call it

237
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,980
And this is completely GPL to and it it's a it's an open source client

238
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:50,140
So I guess my take is as I it seems like a lot of people have really been enjoying telegram based on the message

239
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,660
Yeah, I think our whole team is pretty much switched over now too

240
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:56,340
Which is happens really usually when the whole team adopts something like that that fast

241
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,500
Usually is a good sign. I think what people have really liked is

242
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,980
It it's very clean and I think Matt you kind of like it doesn't have like a Fisher Price field

243
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,860
Oh, man, you know, I love this. I loved it when viral be like, hey, you know, you need you need a sticker

244
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,860
It's three in the morning. Let me send you

245
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:17,700
It's like seriously leave you and then you dismiss it that keeps coming back. I don't get that with this. I love it

246
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,700
They sold me. What do you think in rotten corpse?

247
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:26,740
I'll just wanted to point out that you know when you featured Viber a couple months ago or so and

248
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,140
No one freaked out

249
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:33,380
But for some reason when something you're featuring an alternative that's more open

250
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,620
It may be not open source in the client

251
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:41,900
But open protocol and there are clients that use the protocol that are open source that you can easily use and

252
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:49,220
But then people are freaking out about the one that's more open and didn't snap on the only one that's completely proprietary

253
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:53,900
Yeah, that is interesting. I guess maybe it's because it's more of the category. I don't know

254
00:19:54,580 --> 00:20:01,060
I I'm not quite sure that's a good observation. I wouldn't be I know you had a note about a Android client

255
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,540
Yeah, so I had been using

256
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:09,260
WhatsApp for a couple of years and all of our family over our Christmas gathering

257
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:15,780
We've all switched over to tell it telegram on our Android phones and we're using telegram telegram X

258
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:20,100
For Android, which is made by delicious, which are the same people behind

259
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,780
The chomp and texture SMS clients. So if you've ever used those

260
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,660
It's a really decent

261
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,460
messaging

262
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:36,080
Implementation that's familiar to the chomp and texture users but uses telegram. It's pretty good. No kidding chomp is awesome

263
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,620
So yeah now I'm more excited to use that. Yeah, that is really I did see I did see them

264
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:48,020
Telegram X they've wonder though whether it was just a clone or something to be trusted or not

265
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,340
So that's good that it's been vetted. Thanks. Yeah, I will grab that

266
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,980
I've been pretty impressed overall with the speed of it, too

267
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:01,580
I didn't I didn't have a good way to demo it on air on on on Sunday, but

268
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:06,800
You know, I'm sometimes I'm when I have these chats going I've got it on my mobile device and two computers at the same

269
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,800
Time and I am I am blown away with

270
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,520
It's not perfect. But a lot of times I send a message and it shows up on all three devices

271
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:19,880
Instantaneously, like I don't even see how I could transfer the data that fast and yet it's there now that said I

272
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,040
Have been it's funny because like I think sometimes a lot I come to these things and I test them in a way

273
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:30,160
They've never been tested like I kind of did this to bit message and now I've done it to myself a telegram

274
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:35,800
Where I put myself out there and so what ends up happening is I just get an S ton of messages and I think sometimes

275
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:42,160
these messaging systems have never had somebody that has that happen and so I'm noticing like the desktop client will not show like if

276
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,760
I get say

277
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,020
Like it like you say I don't say I have the desktop client open

278
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:54,440
And maybe overnight I get eight new chat sessions start and they'll all show up on my smartphone

279
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,040
But when I open up my desktop

280
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:01,200
I have to close the telegram desktop client and open it again before the chat show up and I prefer to reply on the computer

281
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,880
So yeah

282
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,880
Anyways, there you go

283
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,040
and the other last last thing I'll say about telegram is the other thing that's nice is you can give out a user ID instead

284
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,920
of your phone number with like other messaging programs and

285
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,000
you can integrate it in with pigeon because they've already right written a plug-in for lib purple and

286
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,640
You can just use your existing desktop messaging client, which is kind of cool. I'm not saying it's

287
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,640
Don't forget the fact that you can also say that it's a whatsapp club

288
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:33,720
Basically, so it's very very easy to show to others because they'll pick it up straight away. Ah good to nice

289
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:40,260
All right. Oh, go ahead one last one last. Yeah. Sorry. I'd also like to add that

290
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,800
It's also available for Firefox OS. I just had a look. Yes. Thank you. That's right. I meant to mention that

291
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,800
It is on Firefox OS as well

292
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,840
So there you go. Okay won't be one last one. Go ahead. This is the last last one

293
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,960
Yeah, what my family liked about it is unlike whatsapp

294
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:03,520
They were able to have telegram on their phones and their tablets and have their entire message history available

295
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:09,760
So it didn't matter what device they were on they were able to see all of their messages receive all of their messages and reply

296
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,600
Yeah, that is really nice, especially for like the family members that switch to the tablet

297
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,260
Once I go sit on the couch and watch TV, that's we have we have family members

298
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:23,960
I just noticed when we went over to the for the holidays that just have the tablet next to their favorite table

299
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,760
That's next to their favorite chair, right?

300
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:31,160
And when they're watching TV, the favorite tablet comes out and they sit there and they play on the tablet

301
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:36,280
I'm guessing I don't think it ever leaves that spot and the fact that they often don't have their phone with them when they're sitting

302
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,760
there

303
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,660
Is is a is a big boost for a telegram

304
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:46,140
Yeah, so yeah, and I I think it I think overall

305
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:50,720
The thing to sort of note about this is this is our last episode of 2014

306
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,940
And this is obviously going to be a huge area in 2015

307
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,420
And I hate to be that guy, but this is the post Snowden

308
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:05,860
This is one of the butterfly effects of the Edward Snowden leaks is everybody's hyper conscious now about encryption and and a little more

309
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:09,020
Suspect about encryption when people are saying we have PhDs

310
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:13,720
So you can trust us and then people are not trusting them like they used to so some of the pushback

311
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,960
We are seeing about telegram is like totally legit

312
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,900
like exactly

313
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:23,500
Where our head should be at now because we've just gone through a year of some shit and it really has shown us that we need

314
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:28,020
To be a little bit more critical of this stuff. So I'm not I'm not begrudging anybody

315
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:33,300
I just wanted to clarify that you know, this is where we are taking the input on this on this topic

316
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:37,140
It's something we're thinking about. I'm not totally sure though like for us if it matters

317
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:41,620
so you just have to make those same kind of values at value decisions yourself and

318
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:45,660
There you go. Actually if you if you're cool with everything we talked about check out telegram

319
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,460
I think you'll like it quite a bit and

320
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,980
it looks like a lot of people in the mobile room are using it too and

321
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,740
When we go out to events and stuff, we'll really put it through its paces

322
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,380
Okay

323
00:24:55,380 --> 00:25:00,340
So I think the real thing to just kind of leave it out is it's something that we like that serves a purpose for us

324
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,540
that's pretty much where it comes down and and

325
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:09,020
That doesn't mean that in the future. You won't see a segment from us on like like an awesome XMPP server setup or something

326
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,700
Like that. It's just for

327
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,860
For us and going out in the field to make these shows for you that that that's what works for us

328
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:19,500
And it's a huge part of it really and it's really hard for me to wrap my head around is

329
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:26,100
That we needed something that was that was genuinely mobile first because so much of our team is on their mobile and they always have

330
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,100
a data connection on their mobile and when they're at

331
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:33,540
Conferences they're on their mobile and that was something that once once I had made that as Matt and I like to call it

332
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,780
New term pivot once I'd made that pivot

333
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:40,480
I had realized this is I got to rethink the way I'm doing this

334
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:48,180
And speaking of mobile and rethinking mobile and making sense ting go to linux.ting.com right now sponsor of the Linux unplugged show

335
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:53,220
Linux dot ting comm will take $25 off your ting device if you have a ting

336
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:56,340
Compatible device and there's more and more of them and in February

337
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:01,380
There'll be even more because ting's going GSM's you got CMA and GSM if you have a ting compatible device

338
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:06,860
They're gonna give you $25 of credit that might just pay for your first month. It often does it did for me

339
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:11,140
Linux dot ting comm go check them out and try out their savings calculator

340
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:15,700
You plug in your existing information and see how much ting would make a difference for you for me

341
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,460
it's a huge difference because it's no contract and no early termination fee, but

342
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,100
what I really love and

343
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:26,660
And to be honest like to know where the termination fee thing like

344
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,820
That's nice if you're in a contract, but for me that doesn't matter

345
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:35,660
I'm not gonna switch from ting like that nowhere the nowhere the termination fee is not a big incentive for me anymore

346
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:40,620
I can totally get like a family if I'm in the old paradigm like that. Oh wow really that's great

347
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:45,660
No ETF like how can they even do that well turns out they can right? It's easy now

348
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,980
I'm it now that I'm a ting customer

349
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,220
It's not the no ETF that keeps me around that doesn't make any sense

350
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:53,660
What keeps me around is that I'm only paying for my daily usage

351
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,540
They just what I use so if I make a couple of calls today

352
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,700
I'll just pay for that

353
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,620
Yeah, I don't have to have a huge plan

354
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,900
But if I need to make a ton of calls this the plan

355
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:08,360
Easily scales and the pricing makes a ton of sense ting just takes your minutes your messages and your megabytes whatever you use

356
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,940
That's what you have to pay well guess what?

357
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:15,500
Guess what just happened to me my files box died at my house

358
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:19,220
My firewall is fine all of that's fine the lands fine

359
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:25,300
But the literally the Ethernet port on my files box sitting outside in the freezing weather popped last night

360
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,900
Yesterday no no internet for Chris well

361
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:34,500
What would I do just call up my cell phone provider and change my data plan for that month? Oh?

362
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:43,400
Hello mr. Carrier. Yes, I need 10 gigabytes this month and not the regular 2 gigabytes that I know dude

363
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:49,380
I pay for what I use I just turn on the hotspot tethering and now the devices in my house connect to my Nexus 5 over

364
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:55,140
The Wi-Fi and we're going out over tings LTE. I'm paying for my usage because that's how it should work

365
00:27:55,140 --> 00:28:00,700
It's mobile it makes sense to give you tools to watch all of this you can set alerts with their Android or iOS app and they

366
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,100
Have no hold customer service

367
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:07,860
They've got a ton of great devices over at the ting store if you want to just grab a GSM sim you can or you can

368
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:13,340
Go up and get yourself anything from the latest Android devices to a feature phone like I pulled out this feature

369
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:16,740
Phone here the kill Sara Verve the kill Sara Verve

370
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:21,220
It's like wow okay. Yeah, I see a number pad there wait

371
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,700
So you mean I use that number pad to make phone calls that's weird

372
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:28,060
It's got a camera, but then check out this badness slide down full QWERTY keyboard

373
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:32,660
Yeah, you can still get one no contract. No early termination fee a hundred and seven dollars when you go to linux.ting.com

374
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:38,900
Why not I mean if you just need a phone why not right all right? Here's another example the iPhone 5s

375
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,780
315 dollars no contract

376
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:46,000
Right on ting are my favorite the HTC one

377
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,740
no contract

378
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:53,820
$340 linux.ting.com and they've got the latest and greatest devices they got everything

379
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:58,160
Linux.ting.com go over to ting try out the savings calculator

380
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,540
And then just go look at those devices

381
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:06,380
And then keep your eye out because in February things getting even better when they go to GSM linux.ting.com and a huge

382
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:09,220
Thank you to ting for sponsoring the linux unplugged program

383
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:12,060
Love you guys good stuff

384
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:18,540
Okay, what can we do just a couple more quick emails before we get the predictions? I know absolutely okay?

385
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:23,260
all right, okay, so I know I'm honestly not trying to get us in trouble, but

386
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:30,980
You know snow train great username writes in and says why isn't Debian as popular as Ubuntu on last

387
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,380
He says I great question

388
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:36,540
I've been following and loving last for some time now, and you know so he probably knows both you

389
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:41,660
And I love Debian, but he says it always bothers me that Debian the mother of so many great Linux distributions

390
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:48,140
Isn't discussed as a primary Linux distro option when you just throw things out there like arch open Sousa Ubuntu and so on

391
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,620
What's the deal with that?

392
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:53,460
Thanks for the great year and queue up the good work on last so what he's saying to us Matt is like

393
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:58,820
Not like why don't you do more things about Debbie, but like when you're just saying hey try out open Sousa

394
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:05,420
Hey try out fedora. Why isn't Debian in that sentence? What are your thoughts well for me personally as a general rule?

395
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:08,120
I found that packaging is generally my first thing I look at

396
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:12,100
And this is probably all wrong in most people's eyes, but for me packaging is the first thing

397
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,760
I look at when I look at a distro arch and Ubuntu nail it

398
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,460
Open Sousa, you know they do pretty well

399
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:20,420
Thanks to their packaging service and whatnot and all the goodies they got going on

400
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:25,220
But when it comes to Debian, it's kind of hit and miss if it's not in an existing repo

401
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:30,060
You're generally gonna be hunting down a dead package or adding your own repo, which is a whole nother set of issues

402
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,580
I do use Debian on a netbook

403
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:37,780
I actually have lot OS on a netbook right now, and it's a great little distro

404
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:40,980
I love it all day what I brag about it or recommend it to people no

405
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:45,300
I would recommend it to an advanced user maybe even an intermediate user

406
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,860
But I wouldn't recommend it casually just hand in foot

407
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:53,500
so I think also some of it comes from a little bit of bias for me in terms of

408
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:57,580
Well actually ninja Aaron said it best he said dude

409
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:04,580
Linux action show when does Debian do something exciting when they do that's when they cover it for the most part

410
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:10,700
Debbie just plugs along and keeps going and doing its thing for which we are all very grateful on the other hand

411
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:16,400
It was basically all they talked about in Linux unplugged this year, and let's not kid ourselves Debian's fonts yikes

412
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:22,300
Yeah, so snow train falls up. He says I understand that Debian isn't covered very much by other distros

413
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:26,760
But he thinks that maybe we should talk more about it and Red Hat Enterprise Linux and slackware as well

414
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,280
So that's fair enough. It is fair

415
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,720
I mean you know to get Debbie into I don't know to get it to where you really want it

416
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,920
It requires a little nipple rubbing and it sounds a little weird to say that but it's true

417
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,680
You got to kind of massage things out to get everything where you want it

418
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,820
You got to work with your fonts

419
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:43,280
You got to kind of decide on what you want to look where which desktop all this stuff

420
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:48,440
You know it's not really an out-of-the-box experience in my opinion so okay, so last email of the day

421
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,640
And I got the whole mumble room here

422
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,580
I know a lot of us looked at fedora 21 a lot of people in the chat room have been trying out fedora 21

423
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,420
The new anaconda installer isn't new for 21

424
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:03,800
But it's new ish, and it's new enough that Erno writes in he says I've been a linux user since the year

425
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,380
2000

426
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:13,900
And I can install a linux system without a problem I've I've I have probably installed hundreds of linux distros over the years

427
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:20,740
I've been meaning to try out fedora sabian and other distros that use the anaconda installer specifically as

428
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:27,660
For the life of me though. I cannot figure out how to use and set up a multi-disk setup in anaconda

429
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:34,020
Is it just me or is the anaconda installer way too damn

430
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,820
complex after the redesign

431
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,740
Thanks, huh, what do you think Matt? Did you find it complex?

432
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:45,000
You know I was doing a solid like a just a flat install, so I wasn't doing anything multiple partition

433
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,180
I know the auto thing too

434
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:46,680
Yeah

435
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:51,860
Now if I was to try that it would be interesting because I'm pretty sensitive to that not because I can't but because I expect

436
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,860
That sort of thing I expect it to just work well

437
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:59,980
I'll have to take a look I did run into a few issues with the partitioner where like if I had existing partitions

438
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:05,540
That I wanted totally wiped out the part the auto the partitioners auto suggestion system was like

439
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:09,220
Never would never suggest anything that would wipe data of course because it's trying to be safe

440
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:14,280
But that's actually so I felt a little inflexible because I said I wanted to have an auto option that said just use the whole

441
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:18,380
Drive anybody anybody in the mumble room have any thoughts on anaconda a rotten corpse

442
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:22,260
I see you just said something chat go ahead, and what do you think about anaconda? Did you find it complex?

443
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,260
Well I'd say it's probably like a

444
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:31,780
Intermediate, but it's a it's more complex than it needs to be but but you what you're saying is you don't want them

445
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:37,020
My anaconda don't want on okay, all right. Thanks. That's all that

446
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:40,500
I think it's just a transition thing or no

447
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:44,540
It has been a little more complicated than I would like for a while, but at the same time. I still

448
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:49,860
There's only a few installers. I like the ubiquity installer. I like quite a bit the anaconda installers, okay

449
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,860
I mean, it's just

450
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:57,620
Yeah, yeah, sitchie sitchie's all right. Yeah, I don't even know how you say it, but yes, it she's okay

451
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:02,500
Yeah, I think it's cinchy. I don't cinchy. Oh that would make sense. It's like a cinch. Yeah sure

452
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:10,140
Yeah, as far as I as far as I'm concerned the best installers freebsd installer and all the other players can go home

453
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:17,060
All right, so we do have a few things to get into we have of course our predictions

454
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:22,820
And we have a couple of more a couple other items to get to in the show it is the last episode of 2014 and

455
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:29,300
We have our 2015 shenanigans to get into so before we do that before we talk about all of that stuff

456
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:35,900
Let's talk about digital ocean. You know that's where I spin up my droplets. I think I I probably over 2014

457
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,900
I probably did like a

458
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:42,340
Total of like 15 droplets. I think I've kept three that's one of the things I love about digital ocean

459
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,700
Because when something just strikes my fancy

460
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,340
I just go over there and create it because I can get started right away

461
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,900
Digital ocean is really really simple and very intuitive

462
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:54,820
The dedicated offering the most intuitive and easy way for you to spin up a cloud server

463
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:59,700
You can go over there right now and use our promo code. I mean this is the last day for you to use it

464
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:04,300
But it'll work for a little while into January. Don't worry, and it'll give you a $10 credit

465
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:09,020
It's unplugged December, and you can get started in less than a minute when you go over to digital ocean

466
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,020
So you get think about that if you got an idea

467
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:17,340
Your vert you start a virtual box on your clunker. I mean that's gonna start in like a minute right, but you can get a whole

468
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:24,300
Sweet rig spun up on digital ocean in less than a minute, and you get an amazing interface on top of that

469
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,860
It's such a better way to go and then when you want to slide it in production

470
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:33,620
It's so easy to do so you get started in less than a minute and pricing plan start only five dollars a month

471
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,380
five

472
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:38,740
Dollars for our Linux rig that you have root access you can install any package

473
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:45,300
They've got one click installations here to get 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one CPU and a terabyte of freaking transfer

474
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,220
For you yours you can have that

475
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:52,460
For five dollars a month and digital ocean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore

476
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:55,940
Amsterdam and a really nice one in London I

477
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,620
You know it's like as like sponsors

478
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:01,780
They should probably send me to the London data center so I can tell you more about it

479
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:05,620
They should probably just you know just so you might want to put that bug in there

480
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:09,420
They can run with that if they want to I'm just an idea guy, but it's the interface

481
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:14,740
That's what keeps me going back when I when I know I got to go do something. It's it's never like oh, man

482
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:19,000
I got to go manage this I could take care of this like let's go cuz it's the digital ocean interface

483
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,820
That's really really the sweet thing. It's simple and intuitive, but very powerful and power

484
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:28,420
You just can replicate the interface on a larger scale with digital oceans excellent API

485
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:31,100
And they have not only great documentation

486
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:34,460
but a bunch of really good community open source apps that you can use for inspiration or

487
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:38,420
Libraries that you can just take advantage of already and save you a ton of the work

488
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:42,860
I think one of the coolest things though digital ocean has done over there sort of the latter half of 2014 and

489
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:48,340
The audience for Jupiter broadcasting has really paid a huge played a huge role in this

490
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,700
Has been the tutorials at digital ocean

491
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:55,920
Right they they now are getting to the point kind of like where the arch wiki is like when you google for something

492
00:36:56,060 --> 00:37:00,780
Like what you find is like a digital ocean tutorial and an arch wiki tutorial on it

493
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:07,340
And and like that's the level of quality they're getting to because digital ocean is doubling down in this area

494
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:12,620
They're paying you a Jupiter broadcasting listener to go over that you can use the link in our show notes

495
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:18,540
And there's no gimmick. There's no trick. They just they really want good content in their tutorial section

496
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:23,340
So they will pay you up to $200 for it. They'll have you work with their editor, and this is an area

497
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:28,900
They're investing because once you get going in under a minute with your droplet you get something deployed on there with a one-click installation

498
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:34,860
Maybe the entire docker setup. Maybe it's the lamp stack. Maybe it's git lab. Maybe it's ghost. I don't know it own cloud

499
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,980
I mean, it's so easy to get things going over there

500
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:42,540
But then if you ever hit a bump you have those tutorials you can fall back on but if you're an expert like I'm not

501
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:46,980
Gonna run into a bump. I'm an expert you can still go take advantage of digital ocean and write the tutorial and get paid up to

502
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,220
$200

503
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:52,980
I'm really I think it's an area that they've and they've really like the hardware is incredibly fast

504
00:37:53,300 --> 00:38:00,920
The bandwidth is tier one bandwidth out of these data centers the interface is bar none best in the industry all running on top

505
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:05,380
of Linux KVM SSDs, and they're like you know what else we need to do tutorials and

506
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:11,860
Of course sponsor your favorite Linux podcast digital ocean calm unplug December when you check out and a big

507
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:18,980
Thank you to digital ocean for sponsoring the Linux unplugged program. You guys are firing on all cylinders. I love their tutorials

508
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:22,660
I'll tell you if I had a dollar for every time I came back to those like oh, that's how you do that

509
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,780
Oh, yeah, it's great. It's good for it's I mean

510
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,100
I probably don't mean to say you know how to be done you can just go over there

511
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,940
They're good for everybody it really are all right

512
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:36,660
So I guess what 2015 just around the corner Matt you and I made our predictions right over the cuff on Sunday show

513
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:41,100
But we haven't I've been looking forward to hearing what the Bumble room has I?

514
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:45,660
I don't know exactly our best format for this because I know everybody has a lot of ideas so mumble room

515
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:48,620
Why don't we use the you just ping me in the chat room like we normally do and?

516
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:55,500
I'll start with I'll start with one, and then we'll just get things rolling okay, and chat room you bang suggest away

517
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,940
That'll be your job, and here is my first

518
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,940
2015 prediction hold on let me get the bell hold on okay

519
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:10,760
High DPI support becomes a priority a top priority for at least one desktop project

520
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:18,060
High DPI support because you're gonna you have things like the yoga the Macbook retina the 5k

521
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:25,200
I Mac the 4k Dell display you're gonna have a ton of 4k at CES right CES is just around that's one of things

522
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,080
We always have to remember when we do these predictions is we're doing them right before CES

523
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:32,240
And that is where I think the for it's gonna be like a no-brainer you have to have high DPI

524
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:37,860
I think you're gonna have a ton of Windows machines showing high DPI you got the whole Mac line going high DPI

525
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:42,280
It's you're gonna have all these just like at one point boom secure boots here now

526
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:47,600
We have to deal with secure boot high DPI is here in 2015 by the end of 2015. We've got it solved

527
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:54,120
We're super close gnome has it very very close gnome is gorgeous on a high DPI display you open up an application

528
00:39:54,120 --> 00:40:00,440
It totally falls apart, so there's got it like there's a big gap still and it's not it's not I

529
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:05,660
I wouldn't even say it's 80, but it's like 80 80 ish. It's not 85. It's definitely not 90

530
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:11,880
It's it's it's close, and I think we can close the gap in 2015 that right there is my prediction wimpy

531
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,280
I know you have something around these lines go

532
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:19,200
No, I was just querying whether high DPI had actually happened this year with

533
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:25,200
Gnome 3 I don't think so push on a high DPI cinnamon elementary does it does it?

534
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,640
I don't think it counts if like is

535
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:32,560
We know don't call it the chrome, but you know the frame around your screen if that's high DPI

536
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:37,080
But every single thing you do on it is not high DPI. That's not high DPI support. That's like

537
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,160
Yeah, yeah

538
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:48,180
So catching up with with Apple basically maybe and also I think Windows

539
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:52,680
I think Windows 10 is gonna be it's gonna be a big thing is gonna be showing off at CAS. I suspect

540
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:58,820
Oh, uh poppy. Do you have any Ubuntu? Maybe unity 8 related prediction?

541
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,700
Yeah, okay a couple I think

542
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,680
2015 with the yearable two switches to a rolling release

543
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:20,800
Is this a buntu snappy core kind of rolling release or is this more like repos and I'm app dist updating

544
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,800
all the time I

545
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:32,400
Don't know. I'm not sure. I think both potentially, you know, both could happen. I'd like to see the ability for you to

546
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,000
Separate out the applications from the underlying

547
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:42,080
platform and not have to worry about the underlying platform and not and get your applications delivered whether they're clicks or

548
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:48,600
Snappy or Debian packages, whatever. I would just like you to just keep rolling. Okay. All right

549
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,280
so poppy I think with regards to like

550
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,360
Snappy and click packages and having a base on which those applications are installed

551
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:02,080
That's potentially possible to roll in that model

552
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:09,280
But I can't see any way Ubuntu is going to enter a rolling model with its Debian packaging

553
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,280
Not this year. No way

554
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:17,200
Hmm, well, let's see. Yeah, I I tell you what

555
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,760
Pants on my head at the end of 2015

556
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:28,180
Ubuntu goes to a rolling release model on the traditional on the traditional Debian package

557
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:36,560
The pants wager has been made the end of 2015 wimpy will wear his pants on his head if Ubuntu does not

558
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,680
Or does I'm sorry if Ubuntu does go rolling. It does go rolling

559
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:48,280
This is outside of snappy and click packages because on that model it could work but on the on the on the traditional model

560
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:53,960
No way, and to be clear, you know, I still I still think it could work even with Debian packages

561
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,300
That's effectively what we're doing right now with

562
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:05,980
When you run the development release, you know, you're effectively run the development release and then every six months take snapshot do QA release it

563
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:11,580
and then everyone else just carries on but the thing is is that your upstream is Debian and

564
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:18,980
Ubuntu don't pull everything in that comes from Debian because you've so heavily patched an s-ton of stuff that you you

565
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:25,580
Have to block things and that then prevents other packages being pulled in because that's dependency breakage

566
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:28,500
You would have to sink against Debian

567
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,300
Absolutely

568
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:36,540
Well, hang on if we're sinking from

569
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:40,020
Unstable not not testing not

570
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:43,260
Have a gigantic. Yeah, sure

571
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:49,780
But but you don't know rolling doesn't mean you have to have bleeding edge of everything rolling just means it's rolling and you'll get continuous updates

572
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:52,820
It doesn't mean yeah Debian experimental

573
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:57,500
Yeah, you're saying you're saying it's rolling as far as Ubuntu could do it

574
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,940
So as pack as the Ubuntu project is ready to push out a package, they push it

575
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:06,460
But even so I've I've experience of this of working with a truly rolling release

576
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,180
distribution and

577
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:16,060
Understanding how you have to orchestrate the changes when there's an SO bump in something and doing that in Ubuntu with all of the patching

578
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:18,060
It's just gonna be a colossal nightmare

579
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:23,540
Really if a bun to pull it off brilliant, I will wear my pants on my head, but I I think with your

580
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:29,900
Focus on phones and all the other stuff you're doing trying to push to a rolling release model is is gonna be

581
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:34,540
Massive burnout and hugely frustrating for everyone that's involved. Hmm

582
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:38,180
To a very opposing predictions poppy

583
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:44,860
You don't have to accept the pants challenge if you don't want you're already in pants debt. So I I am I am down one pants

584
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:48,700
Debt. Yeah, I have another one. Okay. Go ahead. This one

585
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:55,420
Little bit curable. I predict that in 2015 Amazon will buy canonical

586
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:00,660
Whoa, that's a that's a mind job. What?

587
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:06,260
Yeah, and that actually isn't implausible when you stop and think about it. I

588
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:11,980
Mean it does kind of make sense. Look at the direction. Oh my god. It does right easy

589
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:17,220
Look at the field mobile product that didn't work out because honestly they were trying to use a Google thing on it

590
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,220
And I mean, yeah, I mean it adds up. It's

591
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:22,020
All this and it gives them the desktop and server

592
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:27,540
Oh wow, a boon to touch would be a excellent platform from the for them to deliver a bunch of prime stuff

593
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:33,380
They could bring that in they are AC to its ammo. It's our ability is already all over easy to yep

594
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:39,100
You got it. We would want to own like like one of the biggest technologies on their own cloud platform

595
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:41,100
It makes sense

596
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:46,020
If we're doing troll predictions, I'll go ahead and say that arch is gonna have a snapshot LTS version

597
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:58,020
Wow, I think I just to be clear, I don't think either no troll, but no, I know the Amazon thing has some validity to it

598
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:03,540
If you really look at one factor, yeah, that's you just blew my mind Poby and I like it a lot. You're welcome

599
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,540
That's a good one. I never would have come up with

600
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:12,780
Amazon would buy canonical I would switch distributions and buy some stock in Amazon because I think it's a smart business move

601
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:17,780
But yeah, I'm going to destroy. Yeah, you know what in a way it would I would seriously be one of the smartest business moves

602
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:23,540
I've ever seen Amazon make it will make sense. I mean if they mount their their phone was successful, which it was not

603
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:28,700
Yeah, maybe not but because of that failure. I think that shows them. You know what? We really need

604
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:31,420
Someone to come in and you know fix our bridges

605
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:36,660
Essentially Wow, huh, but would mark do it poppy? I don't know. That's

606
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:42,540
This is just a wild. Yeah stab in the dark. I don't have any inside knowledge. I don't know of any

607
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:47,300
Plans in this direction or discuss the only way I could see the only way I could see it happening

608
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:53,500
Is like if it like if it enabled some kind of big vision or goal like if it like if at the end of the day

609
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:57,340
Like it was uh, it was it was maybe sudden injection of cash

610
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:02,340
You remember it wouldn't have to be like a full-on takeover, right? It could be more like a Zappos purchase

611
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:07,340
Where like they get some money, but Zappos keeps it weird, too. Yep. All right

612
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:11,340
So I said Amazon will buy canonical, but I'm willing to accept any kind of you know

613
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:14,340
anything where they give us a

614
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:20,340
Crap ton of money and you know, we brand something Amazon thing

615
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:27,340
I'll accept that you're giving an Amazon a lot of credit but you know the thing is is the thing that would put a buntu in

616
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:31,340
Front of them right would be competition in the mobile space, but also just watching ec2. I

617
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:39,340
Mean they could they might want to do that just because of ec2 let alone the mobile stuff and all that Wow. All right. Okay, that's

618
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:46,340
Yikes, all right. So I let's let's make a big gearshift here Keller. I love your presentation

619
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:49,340
You think to have one huge success in 2015. What do you think?

620
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:53,340
I think far from a success one. You've got a

621
00:47:54,340 --> 00:48:00,340
You get it's very little out of the project to I think everybody is looking forward to the future

622
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:06,340
I mean it's a backstep and I don't think it's a backstep that everybody is going to be willing to adopt

623
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:12,340
Mmm. Yeah, I think it'll be a lot of talk. But what do you guys think about the whole systemd controversy?

624
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:16,340
Is it is it played out? I think dev1 will collapse

625
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:21,340
It will just just fall apart. They're just gonna take their money and have

626
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:28,340
Go at it in the Christmas sales you think or you think they're just gonna maybe not eat or you just it'll be like a it'll

627
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:33,340
Be it. Well, let's shift our expectations and we're just gonna keep plugging away at it and it'll become like

628
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:37,340
Like her there'll be like two guys left running it and it will

629
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:43,340
Take forever and nothing will happen. Hope you there is two guys running it two guys from Italy that I've got no experience in

630
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:46,340
Running a Debbie and derivative. So

631
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:57,340
So does that mean does the systemd stuff kind of die out with them or does this debate continue on I think everyone

632
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:03,340
Accepts pretty much everyone outside that circle of tinfoil hat systemd

633
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:10,340
Haters everyone outside that circle is accepting that this is a way forward for Linux, you know, even us, you know, yeah

634
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:17,340
It makes sense. Why why have this fragmentation or why have this backward step? It makes no sense

635
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:18,340
Well, it was interesting

636
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:23,340
I thought one of the people that kind of just sort of put it in the best soundbite possible is Mark Shuttleworth when he you know

637
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:28,340
When I when I asked him about the you know, why did why systemd like I said, I asked him

638
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:34,340
I said how can you make the logical justification that you got to go with systemd because everybody else is going with systemd

639
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:37,340
But yet you can go mere and I thought he did a pretty good job of saying well

640
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:43,340
Look, this is this reason this is that reason and he kind of just put the whole thing in like basically a 30-second soundbite

641
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:46,340
Which was good. He's quite good at that. Yeah

642
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:51,340
So let's talk about I said telegram and I know it's a d-bag thing to say

643
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:54,340
But I said telegram was a post Snowden product

644
00:49:54,340 --> 00:50:02,340
I think also some of this stepped-up security audits. We've seen Red Hat and Google have done a ton of auditing of like open SSL

645
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:06,340
And stuff like that. We saw shell shock and we saw heart bleed this year

646
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:10,340
I I feel like one of the things is people realize oh crap

647
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,340
We've all been talking about open source code being open

648
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:19,340
But none of us have really been checking it and then like some some some even groups formed up to go check the code and like

649
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:25,340
Some commercial ones and some private ones and so we got a lot of stuff discovered this year. Are we done?

650
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:30,340
Are we through it is 2015 gonna be a ton of more security issues? What do you think Matt? I

651
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:32,340
think that

652
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:34,340
No, I don't think there'll be a ton of new security issues

653
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:40,340
But I do think there's some stuff that we probably haven't really addressed by and large just in the brick-and-mortar world

654
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:44,340
We really haven't done squat other than react when it comes to POS

655
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:50,340
Systems and things like that banking networks, you know, just infrastructure stuff in general. I think there's so much

656
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:52,340
I don't know less

657
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:57,340
Newsworthy stuff that hasn't been touched on yet that we're probably still yet to experience some unfortunate stuff

658
00:50:57,340 --> 00:51:00,340
Do you think Linux will take a few more bruises over 2015?

659
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:04,340
I think that it will I think it will be forced to be vetted a little harder

660
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:07,340
I think that it will actually become

661
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:10,340
The actually of the opposite of that I would say that it's going to be a little bit harder

662
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:16,340
It will actually become the actually of the opposite of that I would say that you're gonna probably see more switching to Linux because of

663
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:19,340
The fact that the existing systems a lot of them incredibly dated

664
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,340
We'll be switching that direction

665
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:27,340
But then because of that then the focus will be even deeper on Linux because of that point. Yeah very much so I would imagine

666
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:34,340
That that actually lends itself to some other things that I think will happen this year. Yeah is more

667
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:38,340
Devices and more software will ship with encryption

668
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:42,340
Yeah, by default. Yeah, great. Yeah, I could definitely agree

669
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:48,340
And you could even maybe see carriers like I could even be something like T-Mobile carrier of encryption or something

670
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:51,340
Wimpy you had a thought on security and privacy breaches

671
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:54,340
Yeah, so

672
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:56,340
What poppies Mike?

673
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:59,340
There you go. He got it. My predictions

674
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:01,340
historically

675
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:03,340
terrible

676
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:05,340
so

677
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:12,340
Exactly the opposite of anything I predict this evening is likely to happen, but I think that a major cloud service

678
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:17,340
So something like Twitter Facebook Google Dropbox eBay Amazon

679
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:22,340
Mm-hmm. They'll suffer a significant privacy or security breach in 2015

680
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:26,540
Yeah, that will change precisely nothing for the average users. I

681
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:32,060
Think 2015 will see the passage of sis, but we won't call it sis

682
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:37,740
But but there's already the they're always in the wake of the Sony thing. I've been tracking it for unfiltered

683
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:40,840
There is already legislation working its way through the system today

684
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:46,840
President Obama has already called for legislation and it will be a cyber sharing act

685
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:51,340
It'll be the government needs to share with the private industry and that'll be how it's pitched

686
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:58,180
There's too many cyber vulnerabilities that the government knows about they have all this advanced monitoring all of this know-how because they're cyber warriors

687
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:03,060
But it's the dumb industry the dumb private sector doesn't know about it. So we can't share with them cuz of laws guys

688
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:06,460
So if we pass these laws then we can share the super cyber information

689
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:10,980
What it really is it'll be the same thing that happened during the Bush era during the Bush era

690
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:15,420
We indemnified all the telcos to allow us to install of the NSA taps. This is the same thing

691
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:17,820
This is gonna be tech company indemnification

692
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:21,820
You got to be part of the big boy club to get in but you'll be in and they'll do some sort of

693
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:28,960
Cyber security information sharing after exactly the kind of event that wimpy is talking about the only reason why I say that is because

694
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,600
There's literally already legislation ready to go

695
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:37,740
Just needing an event to happen and it just takes an opportunity and it's done and we'll look at it as sort of like

696
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:38,900
Oh now hopefully they'll work together

697
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:44,780
But in reality, it's just gonna be capitalizing on exactly what wimpy is talking about nothing to really change for the end-user

698
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:51,600
I think to 2015 is gonna be like 2014 was boy. They're really figured out like cyber boy

699
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:56,780
We really ended the year with a cyber boogeyman. So going into 2015 that's gonna be a good one

700
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:58,780
And I I think you've nailed it wimpy

701
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:01,140
Unfortunately, I'm a bit of I know that sounds awful

702
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:05,480
I'm a con you have a thought about point-of-sale systems under constant attack over 2015

703
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:12,220
I'm a con. No. Okay. Well, I think that one's going twice. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There you go

704
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:16,200
I guess that was kind of his thought is I and that's something we followed a lot in tech snap is the point-of-sale

705
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:19,920
Devices a lot of them still XP. So hopefully we'll get that sorted out

706
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:25,320
Well, and even someone is not, you know, someone like myself who's by no means an expert in any capacity in that area

707
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:30,700
I would just looking at it. I'm looking at the reaction to it and the lack of anything happening. I find that interesting

708
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:35,340
Hmm, let's wave our arms around a lot and scream and yell and put it in the news and then we'll go back to business

709
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:37,340
As usual. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought I'm coming

710
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:44,460
Never mind wimpy. Let's you know what? I like the way you're I like the way you're thinking. Let's stop talking about the negative stuff

711
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:50,620
Let's talk about VR. I've got an oculus right here. I'm looking at it. What are your predictions for 2015 and virtual reality?

712
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:53,220
You're not gonna like it

713
00:54:55,860 --> 00:55:02,160
Prediction is the VR will continue to lack adoption in 2015 and I cite the

714
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:06,380
Adoption of 3d televisions as reference

715
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:12,520
For that prediction. I think VR is not going to penetrate the consumer market

716
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:17,080
at all if ever and it will be the preserve of

717
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,360
commercial applications such as

718
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:25,360
Digital surgery and things of that nature now, have you ever used an oculus?

719
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:32,040
Nope. Hmm. Like I said everything I say this evening is probably going to be completely wrong, but

720
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:39,080
No, if you're just talking 2015, I think I would agree with you I just I think the cost is still too high

721
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:45,880
You know what the the over 2014 we talked about it on tech talk and it's really gone nowhere on tech talk today though

722
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:49,920
We covered Samsung's attempt. They licensed oculus VR

723
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,320
technology and they created about a

724
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,640
$100 $200

725
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,960
VR kit that's totally wireless

726
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:05,240
Which is good and bad, but it's totally wireless you put on your head it also though it requires a note 3

727
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:09,640
Specifically a note 3 and that's like a you get that unlock. That's like a $700 smartphone

728
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:16,960
So that's just the cost is way to the oculus dk2. It's totally not ready for average consumers

729
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:23,280
You know, you got four wires hanging off that thing. You got you got a monkey with your video settings like like an animal

730
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,880
It's just ridiculous

731
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:29,560
But wimpy I got to tell you a I feel like in my life

732
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:34,520
I there has been a handful of moments where I have seen a

733
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:39,080
Technology before I feel like everybody else has seen it and I've gone this is gonna change everything

734
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:43,560
like this is huge and I feel like when I put

735
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:52,100
When I put that oculus VR headset on and I put headphones on and I I was on a raft in the middle of the ocean

736
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:59,080
It was it was tranquil as hell. Like it was super tranquil. Like I was so peaceful

737
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:01,800
It was ridiculous and I'm like, this is amazing

738
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:07,400
I am standing in my studio right now, but my whole body thinks I am on a

739
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,720
raft in the middle of the ocean

740
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:16,840
Chillin and I seriously had a moment and I just think that if other people could experience that it's nothing like 3d

741
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:20,520
It's nothing like 3d, but you've got to make the picture better right now right now

742
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,880
The GPUs aren't powerful enough and the gear is too expensive

743
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:30,360
I think no point about experience is the key point is that you want to experience these things with other people

744
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:38,080
And the problem with 3d televisions is that experiencing 3d TV with other people is difficult and expensive

745
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,440
Yeah, and the same applies to VR

746
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,760
experiencing VR with other people is

747
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:50,440
difficult and expensive and I think these are the reasons why it won't be a mass

748
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,200
It's difficult and expensive in person

749
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:58,040
But it's the exact opposite for a remote experience imagine Skype oculus VR style

750
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:03,760
Then it's amazing because you can be in if you can be in a 3d space and you and I could be looking at each

751
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,320
Other right now and that you know that

752
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:13,600
That you just think about how that could impact podcasting like we it future versions of you know, Linux unplugged episode

753
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:17,320
2000 we could all be sitting at a virtual roundtable having this conversation

754
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:21,440
Holodeck. Yeah, I don't know. Well, I think

755
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:25,800
The new VR space is missing two things

756
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,920
One is a good input device

757
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:35,040
The keyboard doesn't really work when your eyes are covered with you know, this display

758
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:41,480
there's some really cool new things being developed and worked on and I think

759
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:46,920
Like I'm hoping that something really cool is going to come out in 2015

760
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:52,560
And then all once that's done and there's some nice comfortable

761
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:59,400
Input device for VR. All we need is in killer app. Yeah, maybe you know, well

762
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,520
The killer app for previous technologies that have had this problem this this barrier is

763
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:16,600
Basically porn that's the killer app that has accelerated HD streaming. Hold on. Do we have a prediction? Do we have a prediction?

764
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:22,280
Well two related to that one would be I think the opposite of wimpy

765
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:28,280
I think VR will take off but it will be the low-end Google cardboard style

766
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:34,640
Yeah, and I think that will take off dramatically this year. Yeah, which will push the higher-end stuff

767
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:41,840
Maybe the year after or the year after that, but I think once porn gets into VR then you'll see a massive up

768
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,160
I'm not gonna lie. I'm not gonna lie

769
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:46,800
If you came to me and said there was a really good porn app for the oculus just out of journalistic

770
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,480
Interest I would have to check that out so I can report back

771
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:03,600
Video online and it shows up they have a 3d player that if you have an oculus or the Google

772
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:08,240
Cardboard you can watch video online in 3d. All right

773
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:12,980
Yeah, yeah, you would yeah, I do agree on it. It looks like I think

774
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:16,120
Keller also agrees

775
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,000
I look at it

776
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,220
And I think one thing I'm happy about this at this point in 2014 is you guys know?

777
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:26,060
I was pretty I was pretty ticked off that I bought the oculus SDK

778
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:29,800
Being told I would have Linux support and then it got here and it took a month

779
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:34,720
But now the Linux support is here now go figure now the Linux support here is here

780
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:35,800
I have three monitors hooked up

781
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:41,360
I don't have any more room, but I'm gonna hand it over to a chase is gonna be experimenting with it and reporting back soon

782
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:47,320
I have another I have another a prediction. I want to make and I want to get everybody's take on this I

783
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:53,480
Think over 2015 we're gonna see a fork of the elementary OS project. I think people like the idea

784
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:57,920
They like the look of it, but it's moving too slow and people want something faster

785
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:03,520
I think because we're geeks we're nerds, and I think maybe it'll either be an internal division of the project

786
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,920
Which if that happens?

787
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:11,880
They're tight control. Why not? I disagree. Why not just people contribute to elementary I

788
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:15,240
Wish man, I wish

789
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:17,680
Contributions will be added in two years. Yeah

790
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:23,680
Might not be fast enough for them. So yeah, that's what I'm thinking to achieve that level of

791
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:25,520
unification

792
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:26,840
that

793
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:31,960
Elementary has you need that slow development process. I agree a new app

794
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:39,200
Pops up. Yep. It takes a while to refine all the UI elements. Yeah, so it feels

795
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:47,040
Comfortable within the ecosystem of that. Oh, yeah over elementary. So that's no development is the result of

796
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:54,480
Other priorities that elementary developers have and this is not going to go away with a fork

797
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:59,960
Mm-hmm. Well, no, no it will it will and that fork won't have some of those same values

798
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:03,460
And that's the very reason why the fork will have a small following but not be as successful

799
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:09,400
Elementary OS is slowness is actually in a sense what makes a difference, but I think that's a dream

800
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:15,400
I just don't think the the the average Linux user base is using Linux because they want a slow stale

801
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,760
Experience they want something new they wanted that new code

802
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:21,300
They don't have to doesn't have to be super cutting but you know

803
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:25,680
Maybe more than a year old would be good. And so anything that falls below that I think

804
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,320
are

805
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,440
Linux distros that are Ubuntu based and

806
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:35,960
So look good and want to have like somewhat unified look to all the applications

807
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:42,240
But update faster, there's no need to for just switch to a different distro. Oh, hey, man

808
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:46,400
I'm just don't tell me tell the dev one guys. I mean, I'm not the place saying logic applies

809
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,440
I just think it might happen over 2015

810
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:51,640
I wouldn't be so I'm not making a I'm not gonna make a pants bet over this one

811
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:55,680
You know what? I got a prediction. I can make a pants bet about though

812
01:02:55,680 --> 01:03:00,280
I'll be willing to make a pants bet about this. Okay. All right. You know what? Okay. Okay. Hold on

813
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,280
I got a ding. I got a thing for the

814
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:06,840
Pants over here. Yeah. All right. That's the ding for the elementary OS fork prediction. I'm trying to ding

815
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:09,000
I maybe I'll find them in editing

816
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,520
I don't know later on so that we want to go play these back because we all will have to

817
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:17,120
Count for our predictions. All right, so I my next prediction

818
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:21,600
I'm willing to go on the record and make a pants bet about if I get this wrong

819
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:28,520
For at least an entire segment of last I will wear my pants on my head. Okay, I don't know when I get

820
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:31,080
Chatterum will have to set the date

821
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:38,600
Well, I do I was thinking us pants would be very funny because then I have to deal with like these long-ass pants

822
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:41,640
But if I mean there's room for negotiation

823
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:48,840
Negotiation what we'll negotiate, but first I'm gonna tell you about Linux Academy Linux Academy comms. That's right

824
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:51,700
I'm telling you about Linux Academy right now Linux Academy comm

825
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:57,680
Unplugged to get you our special 33% discount go over there and check them out. I know

826
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:03,400
You're expecting me to talk about New Year's resolutions right now and give you a hard time about

827
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,920
How you always want to do something over the New Year's and how you want to get your skills

828
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:10,320
I'm not gonna do that because I think you could use Linux Academy anytime

829
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:14,540
I don't think it needs to be New Year's. I think sometimes that gets us to think about these kinds of things

830
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:20,760
But truthfully I think we've all been thinking about a way to keep our skill set up a way to check out new

831
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Technologies without having to go through the entire implementation stack and being guided by experts

832
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
I think we've all thought about that from time to time

833
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,920
Linux Academy is a unique opportunity. First of all

834
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:35,160
They're sponsors and you can support our show by checking out our sponsors go to Linux Academy comm slash unplugged

835
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:39,360
But second of all and I think this is actually probably the more and more probably should so this one first

836
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:42,960
But I'm selfish. It's it's content created by people that

837
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:49,520
Genuinely give a shit about this right? They care about Linux. They care about open stack. They care about all of this

838
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:57,320
Fundamental things that they're teaching you about unlike all the other online education systems that are these one size fits all come in

839
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:00,800
We'll teach you all of these subjects because we bring in all these it's crap

840
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,000
That's not how it works

841
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:07,620
You start with a core group of people that really care about Linux and open source and people that are genuine

842
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:12,980
Educators that want to spread information and then people that know how to build all of us and people that know how to create

843
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:16,260
Livestreams and websites and do the coding you bring them all together

844
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:22,180
The sys out even it's great because it's like there's a sys admin element because they have they have labs that autospin up you bring

845
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:25,860
Them all together and that that rare thing is Linux Academy

846
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:28,740
You just do not get

847
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:35,740
This kind of accumulation of all of this talent in one place too often and it's Linux Academy go to Linux Academy comm slash unplug

848
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:41,500
You'll get step-by-step video courses downloadable comprehensive study guides your courseware comes with its own server

849
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:44,020
So as you get to a point in the lab, they spin up a server for you

850
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:47,420
It's on AWS don't matter you pick from seven plus links distributions

851
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:50,900
They'll automatically adjust the courseware to match the Linux distro

852
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:55,460
If you're hopping around distros like Popey is you don't have to care you just feel good

853
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:59,820
You know when you choose the fedora stuff and automatically adjust all the courseware to match fedora

854
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:04,060
They're honey badger about that kind of stuff and you get to keep your progress right in check as you go

855
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:07,900
So, you know right where you're at how long something's gonna take they got learning plans, too

856
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:12,840
You're busy. You don't know busy, but I know busy and let me tell you I still make Linux Academy work

857
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:16,820
I go into Linux Academy. I have a learning plan. I say Linux Academy. I got this much time available

858
01:06:16,820 --> 01:06:19,800
I want to learn something. They'll automatically they're

859
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:24,540
Dynamically generate a courseware for you with little bits of here's where this how long is gonna take you

860
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:30,460
They'll send you reminders about quizzes. You can download mp3s. You can check out the live streams of the courseware

861
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:31,900
You can ask questions of the educators

862
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:37,740
They have a community where you can go participate and give you that bump when you fall behind and they're always adding new content

863
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:39,780
puppet Docker

865
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:53,060
I'm really excited about Linux Academy because I think this kind of niche focus on the technologies

866
01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:54,940
It's super kick-ass that we all care about

867
01:06:54,940 --> 01:07:00,660
That's what it takes to make money making that difference is what it takes and that's what Linux Academy is all about Linux Academy

868
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:06,860
Comm slash unplug go check them out and a big thank you links Academy for sponsoring the Linux unplugged program

869
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:12,780
I have been a member the entire time that they have been a sponsor and I'm always checking out their new stuff

870
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:16,500
All right. So continuing on with our 2015 predictions. I

871
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:21,340
Last year when I was reviewing the Linux action shows prediction for 2014

872
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:27,000
There was one topic that obviously was dominating our mindset and that was steam and steam machines

873
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:33,100
It was all about what's valve gonna do. It's gonna change everything steam games. Oh my gosh, they're gonna come to Linux

874
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:35,100
So I'm gonna make

875
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:37,860
My steam machine prediction right here

876
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:44,740
now it's hard to say because valve has already said no steam machine business at CES and

877
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:48,340
So that to me was like, oh

878
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:51,300
They're not ready to show us anything. Okay

879
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:56,820
They're not ready to show steam machines at CES. That's probably a bad sign. Plus nothing ever shipped this year

880
01:07:56,820 --> 01:08:02,340
Really? We never really I mean one thing that shipped right was that was the Alienware thing that runs windows

881
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:08,020
So we remember how we predicted that would go yeah, yes, we were correct

882
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:12,860
Here's my prediction convention though. It yes exactly

883
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:20,360
Exactly. What's that called? I'm pretty I'm for blanking. Yeah, those GDC and G and e3 both of them

884
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:27,040
Yeah our prime opportunities for a steam machine to be released and I think by the time we were doing this episode in

885
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:31,260
2015 I think there will be a steam machine on the market that we can buy

886
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:32,540
I don't know

887
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:36,380
I cannot predict what its success is gonna be because there's so many variables involved there

888
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:43,520
But I do want to go out on a limb and say end of 2015 a steam machine that we are at least perhaps

889
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:47,020
Somewhat compromising but happy with and if that doesn't happen

890
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:50,240
By January, I'll wear pants on my head

891
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:55,920
Well, Doug Lombardi said valve is planning a large steam machine presence for GDC

892
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:59,460
2015 which is in March so it could well happen

893
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:03,580
yeah, the thing is and I didn't know that but the thing is that I

894
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:09,420
Presence well, that doesn't mean much because we've actually had a steam machine presence a year ago

895
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:11,500
Like we've seen steam machines before

896
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:18,060
The scene a steam machine and then having maybe potentially millions of them in people's living rooms are really two different things

897
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:21,480
I'm not saying millions, but I'm saying it's a it's available for purchase

898
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:25,380
Since then the OS has had a lot more of a workout and they've been doing

899
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:30,340
Delivering updates and getting used to delivering updates and more and more games are available

900
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:37,060
I think something like seven of the top ten games on Steam have Linux. Yeah versions available

901
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:41,260
Yeah, something like that. Yeah, so it I mean even by then it'll be even higher

902
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:46,680
So I I maybe it just market wasn't ready for it last year, but it maybe is this year

903
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:50,020
I I reckon by the end of the year. There will be steam machines on market

904
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:56,980
Keller so I look at the price and I think by the time that steam machines hit the market the ps4 and the Xbox one

905
01:09:56,980 --> 01:10:01,780
We'll probably have gone through at least one maybe two more pricing revisions. What do you think about the price Keller? I

906
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:04,340
mean if you can get

907
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:06,680
decent hardware at a lower price and what your

908
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:12,760
Good console our show built the library. You have a good chance to to gain the users

909
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:19,360
For the Christmas season, but they're gonna have they right now you're going to that transistor phase building at the library

910
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:27,160
Now thing like I said again if you can just get the cost of hardware down to where it's below the Xbox or the ps4

911
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:32,560
We can do it. That would be a slam dunk and it's got a good name recognition already

912
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:37,320
So they give is really about the price. I agree. All right, so that's my steam machine

913
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,320
prediction

914
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:46,480
MX or M Fox dog and Fox dog really to G's Fox. I know you have a prediction about digital production for 2015. What's that?

915
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:50,120
Well at the moment

916
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:56,400
Digital production on the Linux has gone in leaps and bounds like with editing and actual animation

917
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:59,440
So I believe that in 2015

918
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:03,040
Most production will be either Linux or you or

919
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,760
Apple based

920
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:09,920
Because apples are great for design because the high DPI

921
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:13,560
That's true

922
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:19,160
So with Linux and its graphics drivers going really well as well with CUDA and OCL

923
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:22,240
It's just becoming more and more

924
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:30,560
Efficient to do production work on a Linux box. Yeah, so I believe that the vast majority of

925
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:32,960
Digital production will be in Linux space

926
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:37,680
I wouldn't be I wouldn't say the vast but I wouldn't be surprised to see more and more and we might not even hear a lot

927
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:41,640
About it. One of the things I've noticed in our production workflow here Jupiter broadcasting is

928
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:44,760
one of the heaviest editing shows

929
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:50,280
For Jupiter broadcasting is actually on filter which is a little bit of an understatement

930
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:55,520
But if you think about it, I'm filter show one show might have a hundred clips in it or 30 clips

931
01:11:56,240 --> 01:12:02,240
It there's a huge ass range and every single one of those clips is edited by hand by me and

932
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:07,080
2014 was the year where it became not only

933
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:10,880
Faster for me to do it under Linux, but I actually got more features

934
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:14,600
One of the things is we started adding more video clips to unfilter

935
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:21,920
And I have been editing all of those under Linux using a set of tools most of which I've shared over the year as app

936
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:25,920
picks in Linux action show and and that for me, I

937
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:29,080
Guess I need to back up because which got to understand is for me

938
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:33,280
It's always been this guilt like oh, I should be editing and producing under Linux

939
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:37,280
But oh my god, it takes so much time and oh my gosh, the tools are not there yet

940
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:38,560
It just drives me crazy

941
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:45,600
What I have now with these clips for unfilter is I've gone from that this this oh, what a burden

942
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:51,360
To man, you know what? It's faster. If I just do this under Linux, it's better

943
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:57,080
The results are better when I do this under Linux. It is more efficient under Linux now

944
01:12:57,080 --> 01:13:01,880
That is not like see that's a big deal because it's not just like I can do the work under Linux

945
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:05,040
It's it turns out better when I do it under Linux

946
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:11,360
That is huge for media production for Linux. So if that continues on if that kind of you know, one by one the little tools

947
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:16,160
Right now it's it's small tools that I'm chaining together if that continues on that progress. Whoo

948
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,240
That's gonna be awesome

949
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:22,680
That'd be really great. I don't know. We'll see 2015. I think it's just gonna be a slow steady march

950
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:25,440
I don't think I'm not I don't think you make any big predictions there

951
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:30,760
So we kind of we've kicked around a bunt to touch a little bit

952
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:38,520
Anybody want to make any specific a bunt to touch predictions? We we suspect we'll see something from BQ in early 2015

953
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:41,760
Don't know who's gonna be able to get their hands on it, but probably a lot of us

954
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,520
No, what do you think

955
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:50,040
You think you know a major carrier you think it you think you know

956
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:54,400
If you think if you're on a major carrier, you'll be able to use a bunt to touch if you want to somehow

957
01:13:55,080 --> 01:14:00,480
So here's how I see the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the

958
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:01,920
See the perfect storm playing out

959
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:08,000
If we can get a major carrier to hurt badly enough to where they're forced to pull their heads out of their butts and look for something

960
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:13,520
New yes, then I see a major carrier coming along and saying okay clearly we've Android it ourselves to death

961
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:15,440
We need to try something new fresh

962
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:20,440
tap into the army of people that are still rocking flip phones or people that maybe are

963
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:24,560
In the market to change their mobile operating system into something different

964
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:31,080
I think I think it's entirely possible the key is to which carrier that's gonna be and that's hard to say

965
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:39,080
Verizon's incredibly stubborn AT&T, you know, they're kind of head the clouds T-mobile, you know, they might it just it's really hard to say for sure

966
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:45,840
But I think it could happen but it will take that pain point. Hmm. Yeah, I would like to just I guess what I'm looking for is

967
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:54,200
Yeah, I guess it seems to bet the better approach would be then over 2015 is devices carriers have already blessed and then you've reflashed

968
01:14:54,200 --> 01:15:00,720
Yeah, right now that could happen too. I mean it's but as far as any carrier embracement they need pain points or they don't care

969
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:06,400
It's either dollar signs or others hurts. How do you think? Okay. All right. How you feeling about Firefox OS any different? I

970
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:09,700
think that's got a real chance of

971
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:16,120
Seeing adoption in areas that have not really had a lot of sense of smartphones before I don't know

972
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:20,920
I see them like on eBay and stuff like this and it's like they're really approachable unlocked price-wise

973
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:27,600
I honestly think that someone got there got themselves together and actually gathered up a bunch of these and just started popping them into kiosk

974
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:32,640
Somewhere they would sell these all day long. I really believe that yeah, and I think a bone two phones could do the same thing

975
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:35,280
But again, it's its presence its presence. Hmm

976
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:42,600
Yeah, I I find it interesting that I felt like I was more confident to make predictions about Ubuntu touch at the end of

977
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:47,640
Last year than I am of this year. Yeah, just a lot of unknowns. I mean, it's a great it's a great option

978
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:52,120
It's a great idea, but people need to touch and feel things. They need tactile experience

979
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:58,000
That needs to happen. Yeah, this year was hard this year. I really struggled with Android

980
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:05,080
I think this I think 2014 became a year where for me I I became a disenfranchised Android user

981
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:07,640
I still have my Nexus 5 I'd say Android is

982
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:13,840
70% of the operating system to runtime like 70% of my time in an OS is Android

983
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:18,880
I I now fluctuate between Ubuntu touch and selfish OS and Firefox OS

984
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:25,880
But I I just I can't get past the fact that at the end of the day I enjoy using iOS more

985
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:31,000
I think iOS is more performant. I think it's simpler for what I need to do

986
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:36,820
I just need a phone that does text messages and listens to podcasts. That's literally all I need a phone to do and so for me

987
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:45,000
For me Firefox OS selfish OS and Ubuntu touch are very appealing because they essentially could very easily be able to satisfy those needs

988
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:50,720
Now it's funny because I'm also the same person where when I go somewhere my requirements for a smartphone

989
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:54,600
Totally change now all of a sudden needs to be ways right needs to be able to do

990
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:57,760
Yeah, so it's it's it's I find it

991
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:02,320
That's what I like about the Nexus 5 is that right now I like when I become that person I

992
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:07,300
I can use Android and when I'm the guy that just needs to listen to stuff and do and make text messages

993
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:11,020
I can use a different OS, but I find none of them to be ideal at this point

994
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:16,100
Yeah, I think anything that it can embrace your existing ecosystem has an edge over the other true

995
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:20,500
Yeah, you know stuff, you know, obviously Android's the most likely to be embraced ecosystem

996
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:26,460
I think that's really the main piece of it for myself. I like to use apps just to run my apps so that I can manage

997
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:28,100
my apps I

998
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:32,980
Live in apps. I have everything. It's ridiculous when I came when I dropped iOS years ago. I

999
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:37,480
Don't know three four hundred dollars of crap. Yeah, I mean, you know, I lost a fortune

1000
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:42,820
So I'm very sensitive to that ecosystem. Yep. Yep. Great point and that's a bigger deal than ever now and

1001
01:17:43,420 --> 01:17:48,900
Wimpy we got to talk about I mean, I know this is this is a family-friendly podcast

1002
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:51,900
We got to talk about the c-word though convergence. What do you think?

1003
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:58,540
Well, I have a prediction about convergence and that's canonicals definition or Mark Shuttleworth's

1004
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:03,620
Definition of convergence. So right now I've got a Samsung note 2

1005
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:11,140
Which was issued by work and that's now two years old and it's up for renewal in terms of the hardware

1006
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:17,420
There is nothing on the market today that is significantly better than this phone that I've got that's two years old

1007
01:18:17,420 --> 01:18:22,620
Yep, you know the cameras have got slightly more megapixels. Yeah, there's a touch more RAM

1008
01:18:22,620 --> 01:18:25,220
There's a couple more cores on the processor

1009
01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:31,660
But there's not much to compel me from a hardware point of view to change the device

1010
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:36,860
I feel the same way about my Nexus 5. I feel the same thing because I've got cyanogen on this phone

1011
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:42,340
You know from a software point of view. It's perfectly fine. This could this could march on for another year quite happily

1012
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:49,020
so my prediction about converge devices, and this is canonicals definition of convergence where your

1013
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:57,820
Mobile phone could be your desktop PC is that this convergence story will be adopted by the big players on

1014
01:18:58,820 --> 01:19:04,260
The Android platform and that convergence story of turn your phone into your desktop

1015
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:11,340
will drive the next generation of mobile specs on your phone with regards to CPU GPU RAM and

1016
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:17,220
Story now when you see this is it HTC's implementations Samsung's version of it like is it like yeah?

1017
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:23,380
Each each of the yeah, so the Samsung's HTC's will have their own. You know

1018
01:19:23,940 --> 01:19:30,220
Adaption to what happens to your device when you hook it up to a keyboard mouse and and fixed display

1019
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:36,580
But they I think they're all going to move to that convergence story because the the

1020
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:43,500
Only way you can justify all this extra hardware is to make the extra hardware. Do something. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I

1021
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:49,340
I think I think this already like Google already started making significant

1022
01:19:50,740 --> 01:19:57,740
Moves towards making this happen because as far as I've been able to figure out in the new material design

1023
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:00,900
Specifications or whatever you call it

1024
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:07,460
They actually included something like Ubuntu has which allows the application to scale from

1025
01:20:08,420 --> 01:20:11,620
easily scale from a phone-sized application to a

1026
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:14,460
Full

1027
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:20,140
69 screen type of application and still be usable. So they're making

1028
01:20:21,660 --> 01:20:23,660
Moves in that direction. So

1029
01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:39,660
As far as I can doubt that that might be a very correct prediction. Yeah, I think it makes a lot of sense too because I think over 2015 will be the year you see 64-bit processors hit all of the anything that's considered a modern smartphone over 2015 will point towards the end of 2015 will have to have 64-bit. I'll make that a prediction because that's gonna be a marketing thing, right? And once you start, why do you need 64-bit because you need more than 4 gigs of RAM and why do you need 4 gigs of RAM because you want to run desktop apps?

1030
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:59,220
It sounds horrible, I mean we all remember the A tricks, but I also had a client that would love this

1031
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:03,140
I can think of a specific person. He was a big hitter for a company and this would be perfect for him

1032
01:21:03,140 --> 01:21:10,500
As long as it was rock-solid. Here's where I don't think it's gonna be rock-solid different implementations like Samsung's Sam Samsung's gonna do horrible at that, right?

1033
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:12,100
Yeah

1034
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:14,920
HTC probably gonna do horrible at that and so maybe

1035
01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:19,040
We'll look at this and go but you know who baked this in at the core level is Ubuntu touch

1036
01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:22,300
Maybe that'll happen. Maybe not or what's gonna happen?

1037
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:24,300
more likely is

1038
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:30,500
Apple will come along rip it all off get it right and then nobody will ever talk about anybody else but apples

1039
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:33,420
I

1040
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:34,940
Can't see Apple doing it

1041
01:21:34,940 --> 01:21:38,980
I'd be surprised if they do and I really hope I really hope that

1042
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:42,580
canonical are in the right place at the right time with Ubuntu touch and

1043
01:21:42,860 --> 01:21:48,100
the the devices with the specs actually actually deliver on this because

1044
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:50,780
for all the people that knock

1045
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:58,000
Canonical and Ubuntu touch this is proper Linux on a mobile device and we we should all be supporting that endeavor really

1046
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:00,280
Yeah

1047
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:04,960
Hell yeah. Yeah, I think boy that's it. You know what? I think you nailed it

1048
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,240
I think they're gonna have to use convergence and you know

1049
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:09,680
The other thing is they're gonna be you know, they're already looking around for ideas

1050
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:13,160
They're looking over at Mark Shallow Earth and they're thinking way that guy's saying something smart

1051
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:15,960
We should grab that and they're gonna go do it. I think you nailed that

1052
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:21,560
I'm gonna give that a double ding. All right Keller you want to close this out on the convergence topic with a thought about

1053
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:23,280
thoughts about Intel

1054
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:26,080
Well, I mean if her true convergence to happen

1055
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:32,120
We can't have two separate processor lines to focus on arm versus your your eye

1056
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:34,920
86

1057
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:37,600
We're gonna have to find a way to get Intel

1058
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:43,160
More integrated into the mobile space. Yeah, I mean they're fiercely working on that

1059
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:46,240
But yeah, you're right that that you can already buy Intel

1060
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
phones and tablets

1061
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:52,320
Yeah, what's gonna run on how are they selling? I

1062
01:22:53,200 --> 01:23:01,320
Mean, well, yeah, that's the other thing we you know canonical could make a platform and software that runs on both

1063
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:05,200
I mean Android already does yeah, you shouldn't download the same Android app

1064
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:10,300
I mean, they're their fat binary builds that have x86 code and um HF code inside

1065
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:14,160
But the same thing could happen for pure Linux like a bunty

1066
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:22,460
Yeah, you know and I wouldn't my 2015 another maybe just as my final 2015 prediction would be I don't think Intel is gonna make any

1067
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:26,500
significant inroads in mobile because

1068
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:31,580
the reason why I think that is because I've been along I've been around longer than five years and

1069
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:37,860
Seriously, I've seen Intel talk about this since the 90s, right? If they've been it's just around the corner

1070
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:43,500
It's just around the corner. It's then it's just it's always just around the corner with Intel when it comes to mobile

1071
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:44,900
And I'm not trying to be this guy

1072
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:50,340
But at the same time you're seeing some amazing ass come out of the arm shops. There is really gonna start kicking their ass

1073
01:23:50,860 --> 01:23:56,260
You know you look at the performance some of the some of these high-end tablets coming out of Nvidia and coming and the new

1074
01:23:56,260 --> 01:24:03,460
iPad to air like these things are crazy like six core GPUs and stuff like that like Intel wake the F up

1075
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:08,100
It's it's the ship is sailing so they've really got to double down and I think at the end of the day

1076
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:12,060
It's gonna be more solved like Popey saying by things like Dalvik or whatever the hell

1077
01:24:12,060 --> 01:24:14,520
It's gonna be at the time or QML or whatever the hell

1078
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:15,900
It's gonna be it's gonna be more

1079
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:18,940
It's gonna be handled in the software side less on the processor side

1080
01:24:18,940 --> 01:24:24,540
And so you'll have devices that are Intel you have it you'll have devices that are ARM. I've for two years

1081
01:24:24,540 --> 01:24:28,020
I've been predicting the ARM desktop. I'm not gonna make it this year, but I'm surprised

1082
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:34,900
Well in interestingly the the Intel based tablets that are on the market at the moment were subsidized by Intel

1083
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:42,060
Yeah, they were cheaper and that yeah, and I think maybe people will be less reluctant this year to do

1084
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:49,300
Intel based devices or maybe they'll be more inclined to do it because the way has been proven last year that it is possible to make

1085
01:24:49,740 --> 01:24:56,660
Intel tablets that you know survive a decent battery life and our performance and you know can run all the same applications

1086
01:24:56,660 --> 01:25:02,580
Yeah, I mean this good. Sorry Chris gone. No, I just gonna say I wouldn't put it past Intel to be able to pull it off

1087
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:04,700
You know this time last year

1088
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:10,420
My dad was looking for a tablet an Android tablet and one of the Samsung tablets had an Intel chip in it

1089
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:14,260
And it was significantly cheaper than the the Samsung

1090
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:19,500
10.1 arm box and I advised my dad not to get the Intel

1091
01:25:20,060 --> 01:25:25,300
Device because I said you're gonna be limited in the apps that are available at this point because it's um, you know fairly new

1092
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:32,220
Technology and not everyone's adopted it yet. Yeah, I'd feel a bit differently this year if it was me spending money on a tablet

1093
01:25:32,220 --> 01:25:36,340
I might seriously think about an Intel tablet because I can hack more with it

1094
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:42,820
Yeah, my main my main tablet is an Intel one. Yeah, and it's it's better than any arm tablet

1095
01:25:42,820 --> 01:25:47,260
Yeah, I would much if I was gonna buy a tablet that I would much prefer to have an x86 tablet

1096
01:25:47,260 --> 01:25:49,260
I want all the things about an ARM tablet too though

1097
01:25:49,380 --> 01:25:53,860
But that's just me and you guys like we prefer x86 because well

1098
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:56,820
It's just easier to load anything we want on it a but B

1099
01:25:57,140 --> 01:26:02,980
We prefer it because it's x86 and it runs our stuff consumers. Don't give a crap about that though. They don't give a crap

1100
01:26:02,980 --> 01:26:05,700
I actually want the ARM laptop though. I

1101
01:26:07,140 --> 01:26:12,100
I'm surprised we I mean there are some out there. I'm I'm honestly surprised like an Android

1102
01:26:12,380 --> 01:26:19,180
How come how come some major OEM hasn't released an Android based laptop in the US? I think there's some in Asia

1103
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:21,620
I

1104
01:26:21,620 --> 01:26:25,020
Could have stamped on a few people that have done this haven't they? Oh, okay

1105
01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:34,080
Chrome OS arm. Yeah, I'm laptop. Yeah. Yeah Chrome OS is gonna have a good year over 2015. I think

1106
01:26:37,180 --> 01:26:42,500
You Samsung Chromebooks are hard to get in Canada and this is the only reason why I don't have a

1107
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:50,460
Arm laptop. Yeah, those of you who are on Google Plus today may have spotted

1108
01:26:51,180 --> 01:26:53,180
that a Google intern

1109
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:59,060
Now with I guess potentially Google blessing. I'm trying to find the post on Google Plus right now, which never happens for me

1110
01:26:59,780 --> 01:27:03,620
I said earlier you might oh you did. Oh, okay. All right. I'll go search for you

1111
01:27:03,620 --> 01:27:07,820
So, you know what I'm talking about then that that that there is a crew ton like in a window now

1112
01:27:07,820 --> 01:27:09,820
Yeah, here it is right here. Yeah. Oh, yeah

1113
01:27:09,820 --> 01:27:14,520
Yeah, so a Google intern has added support to run crew ton in a Chrome OS window

1114
01:27:14,740 --> 01:27:17,480
Thanks to four hundred and forty seven one lines of code

1115
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:24,720
Fearless people can now run their favorite Linux distributions on their Chrome devices in a window without jumping between terminals

1116
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:30,080
So now now Ubuntu or another distro could be

1117
01:27:31,060 --> 01:27:35,900
Essentially like an app on Chrome OS. So part of me thinks that's great. That's awesome. It allows you to

1118
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:42,780
Switch more easily between the two and part of me thinks is this Google doing their best to try and keep you away from

1119
01:27:43,540 --> 01:27:47,020
the second OS that people are putting on they're

1120
01:27:47,860 --> 01:27:54,820
Very cheap, you know Google so yeah Chrome devices in order to keep you in Chrome. I think it has to be that

1121
01:27:56,540 --> 01:28:00,460
That's it that's because that's the only thing it does that's it doesn't improve performance

1122
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:05,820
It keeps you in Chrome OS and it makes this a feature of Chrome OS. I

1123
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:10,900
Which is fine for some people and we shouldn't be doom and gloom about it because

1124
01:28:11,220 --> 01:28:16,060
You could make the same argument about you know open office and Libre office and get being available for Windows

1125
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:19,260
All those people stay on Windows it helps, you know people make the transition

1126
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:25,380
I think though it's it's gonna be I think it's telling I think it's telling how 2015 is gonna go

1127
01:28:26,620 --> 01:28:27,900
my thoughts

1128
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:30,540
It's gonna be interesting. I you know it's gonna be one of those things

1129
01:28:30,540 --> 01:28:34,500
I think we're gonna have to hold up a stick to see it move cuz I don't think it's gonna happen quite as quickly as

1130
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:39,080
People anticipate we'll get to the end. Yeah, well. No you're right. We'll get to the end, and we'll be like whoa

1131
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:41,080
Whoa what happened what happened? Oh?

1132
01:28:41,260 --> 01:28:45,140
Oh, yeah, that makes sense now that makes sense and we could be all wrong about all of this

1133
01:28:45,140 --> 01:28:49,140
We may be wrong you have a chance timing in context you have a chance to prove us wrong

1134
01:28:49,140 --> 01:28:54,400
You never know you can hold us accountable you can because it's now it is documented forever right here on the Linux unplug show

1135
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:56,400
So Matt if we got it wrong. It's on the record

1136
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:59,620
That's right. You actually got like the best record out of all of us though, so

1137
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:03,560
You you like nailed all of your predictions last year, so I don't even want it

1138
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:08,800
I'm the guy that said the Google public offering thing was a

1139
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:12,240
Classic there's that class you go back far enough

1140
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:18,860
If you'd like to make your prediction go over to Linux action show dot reddit.com and leave your feedback in this week's thread or go

1141
01:29:18,860 --> 01:29:22,460
To Jupiter broadcasting comm slash contact and send yours in and we might read it on a future show

1142
01:29:22,460 --> 01:29:26,980
Don't forget you can join us live on Tuesdays 2 p.m.. Pacific over to jblive.tv for that

1143
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:32,580
Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar to get it converted in your local time zone and last but not least

1144
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:36,460
We'd love to have you join us in that mumble room. It's an open mumble room

1145
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:40,660
You can be part of our virtual lug you just gotta get your mic checked jblive.tv on a Tuesday

1146
01:29:40,660 --> 01:29:52,660
See you back here next week everybody. Thanks so much for listening to this week's episode of Linux unplugged. See you next Tuesday. Oh

1147
01:30:04,340 --> 01:30:07,940
I have a last-minute breaking prediction for myself

1148
01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:13,340
I will spend an inappropriate amount of money on steam games and my wife will give me a hard time in the month of December

1149
01:30:13,340 --> 01:30:15,340
In 2015 that's my prediction

1150
01:30:16,380 --> 01:30:18,540
What was it a fist of Jesus or something like that?

1151
01:30:21,740 --> 01:30:24,500
Wasn't as good as I had hoped but there's some other good ones out there. Yeah

1152
01:30:26,940 --> 01:30:32,460
Yeah, oh yeah, you got more you got more my prediction is that Sony is going to be hacked and

1153
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:37,620
And aliens will be blamed for it. Oh aliens. All right. All right

1154
01:30:38,620 --> 01:30:40,620
JB titles like on everybody

1155
01:30:40,940 --> 01:30:42,420
Wimpy did you have more?

1156
01:30:42,420 --> 01:30:47,340
Why I didn't have more but nobody mentioned wearables or Windows 10, which is surprising

1157
01:30:47,340 --> 01:30:51,260
I would have thought somebody would have had a prediction about those two things either

1158
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:54,260
We don't give a shit about it and what we think is irrelevant and therefore

1159
01:30:55,060 --> 01:30:57,060
not not discussion worthy or

1160
01:30:57,060 --> 01:31:02,940
I don't know. I think maybe on wearables. I think yes, I think on wearables. That is true

1161
01:31:02,940 --> 01:31:05,140
I think on Windows 10, we're all a little melancholy because

1162
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:09,020
Microsoft's ripping us off and it's probably gonna help stop the bleeding a little bit

1163
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:16,180
Yeah, I didn't want to say it, but I've got a horrible feeling that Windows 10 could suck some Linux users back

1164
01:31:17,620 --> 01:31:20,020
No, they weren't good Linux users to begin with then

1165
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:26,980
These are the kind of people that are using Linux because it doesn't cost them anything. Yeah rather than right

1166
01:31:26,980 --> 01:31:30,460
They you know buy into the culture. Yep. That's very true

1167
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:34,580
Hmm. That's a yeah the Windows 10 and the wearables thing

1168
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:41,220
Yeah, and the other thing about it is I think the Apple watch probably the most successful and that sucks so bad because it's

1169
01:31:41,220 --> 01:31:45,480
The most locked in one like you can't use it with your Linux desktop. You can't lose use it with your Android device

1170
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:48,020
It's the iPod iPhone situation all over again meets watches

1171
01:31:48,020 --> 01:31:56,660
Yeah, yeah is Windows 10. I'm going to be free. Yes for consumers. So I don't think the business one will be free though

1172
01:31:57,380 --> 01:31:59,380
No, there's gonna be some

1173
01:31:59,900 --> 01:32:05,700
Hobbled version for home users isn't there? There's gonna be free and I think that will tempt people back

1174
01:32:06,940 --> 01:32:12,500
Well returning the conversation to wearables. I still think that pebble is the only

1175
01:32:13,780 --> 01:32:15,780
Smart watch that I would consider buying

1176
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:23,620
Yeah, that is a good that that one's very calling. Let's see. The for me is I already have to charge my

1177
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:30,160
Phone every day. I already have to charge my laptop every day. I have to charge my tablet every day

1178
01:32:30,980 --> 01:32:32,260
I

1179
01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:35,420
Don't want to add another device to that list

1180
01:32:36,220 --> 01:32:41,040
especially something that a watch used to be something that I didn't have to

1181
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:45,320
Think about yeah, it would just run forever, right? Yeah

1182
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:53,520
The ones that have like a dock that you can put next to your bed and our bedside clock with an alarm

1183
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:58,980
You know every time you go to bed, you just take it off. Yeah, like the motor that see yeah, that makes it way more

1184
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:02,240
This is a valid argument

1185
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:08,960
But I don't think you know how often I forget to transfer my phone and then wake up in the morning with like 5%

1186
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:14,680
Of the body lead. Oh, I guess yeah, so the same I I collect

1187
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:23,880
Classic digital watches from sort of the 70s in the early 80s and some of the models from the 70s that have got the LED

1188
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:25,880
Displays. Oh, yeah

1189
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:32,000
They burn the battery really fast in that the battery burns out in about six months

1190
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:37,940
which used to be considered a major pain in the ass, but against smart watches, which

1191
01:33:37,940 --> 01:33:39,660
At the end of the day

1192
01:33:39,660 --> 01:33:43,820
You're mostly going to use for telling the time on that you need to show at least once a day

1193
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:47,660
Look fucking epic all rumors. Now. That's long since gone

1194
01:33:47,660 --> 01:33:53,900
So is the foosball table and pinball machine and the the cocktail arcade cabinets and I know Popey's got one of those

1195
01:33:54,380 --> 01:33:59,980
Popey you've got bomb Jack haven't you you bugger? Hmm cocktail bomb Jack never even heard of that. Ah

1196
01:34:00,660 --> 01:34:04,980
Bomb Jack is the best arcade game from the 19th. Oh, maybe I'm just

1197
01:34:04,980 --> 01:34:06,980
I

1198
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:12,580
Know you do we've discussed this. Yeah, he bombed Jack is great. Okay. All right. I'm looking up right now

1199
01:34:12,980 --> 01:34:17,940
It's one of the it's one of the only games where I had to rotate the screen in my arcade cabinet

1200
01:34:17,940 --> 01:34:19,940
I had to like the screen out

1201
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:26,220
Cool bomb Jack is ice and the reason I love bomb Jack is um, I

1202
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:34,100
Participated in the the world arcade games on two occasions and the games that I

1203
01:34:34,100 --> 01:34:36,100
I played were a bomb Jack

1204
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:41,100
1942 and GR kung fu and I was European champion for bomb Jack

1205
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:46,860
But I did I didn't get the the world title. Well done, sir. I see that I get to get this looks fun

1206
01:34:47,420 --> 01:34:50,100
It's really good. Yeah, a little stressful little stressful

1207
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:54,660
No, it looks a little stressful because you only got a limited time to get around and there's a lot of guys in your way

1208
01:34:54,660 --> 01:34:58,900
And you have to do it in sequence as well. That's where you really ramp up your points

1209
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:02,660
That's the whole the whole point of the game is learn all the sequences on all of the levels

1210
01:35:02,660 --> 01:35:06,580
It's great. And and the blizzard detection is just

1211
01:35:07,380 --> 01:35:13,620
Forgiving enough that you can pull off some really tight moves around the the enemies. It's a really well designed game

1212
01:35:13,700 --> 01:35:17,780
Hmm that was in fact new into the android

1213
01:35:18,740 --> 01:35:21,860
Uh play store is free jack

1214
01:35:22,580 --> 01:35:27,700
Yes, free jack has a free version and a paid version that's only just turned up and it's basically a clone of bomb jack

1215
01:35:28,340 --> 01:35:30,340
So, uh, yeah, give that a go

1216
01:35:30,340 --> 01:35:35,860
Huh? I have heard of free jack. Did you guys see that the uh, did you guys hear about this, uh, ide for gnome?

1217
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:37,060
Did you see this?

1218
01:35:37,060 --> 01:35:40,820
No, i've been hearing about it. Yeah builder and ide for gnome is doing an indiegogo project

1219
01:35:40,820 --> 01:35:47,880
They've raised 12 000 out of 30 000 so far gnome a modern elegant desktop with a wide range of applications

1220
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:50,660
And high focus on usability

1221
01:35:50,740 --> 01:35:56,420
But underneath the surface gnome is showing its age. Our developer tools on linux are from the last decade

1222
01:35:57,140 --> 01:35:58,740
meet jim

1223
01:35:58,740 --> 01:36:00,740
Jim wants to start contributing to free software

1224
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:05,220
Our community is strong and happy to help but how should jim begin writing software?

1225
01:36:05,700 --> 01:36:12,980
As of today, there are too many tools jim needs to learn first get the group builder the perfect development environment for jim

1226
01:36:14,020 --> 01:36:16,020
Builder is an idea of mine

1227
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:22,660
This summer I quit my job to focus on creating a new ide from scratch with everything a developer will look for in a development

1228
01:36:22,660 --> 01:36:28,520
Environment by integrating gnome's documentation and platform api with a powerful editor and ui designer

1229
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:31,160
We can make it easy for people like jim to contribute

1230
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:35,960
With the funds this fundraiser can provide I will work on builder full time

1231
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:42,920
If we reach 30 000 I can work full time for the next three months and implement builder's core features

1232
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:45,880
Here's a spotlight of three of them

1233
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:49,160
With global search you can find and open anything you need

1234
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:52,920
Builder will as you type find files and documentation

1235
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:56,280
This can even be extended by additional search providers in the future

1236
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:01,800
Many free software projects use a combination of tools to manage themselves known as auto tools

1237
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:04,520
Builder intends to automate the use of these tools

1238
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:08,200
This will make it easy for anyone to build and manage their projects

1239
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:15,340
Builder will have autocompletion for c and c plus plus if we reach our stretch goal. We'll add support for vala and pythons

1240
01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:23,420
To make writing even easier builder will also provide auto indentation and api exploration on the fly

1241
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:29,800
So the idea is like if you want to start developing for the linux desktop, uh, you know right now

1242
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:34,120
There's not a real clear path you're supposed to take this is something we've heard about from people that write in necoda radio

1243
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:35,960
They're like, you know, you're not going to be able to do this

1244
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:38,840
This is something we've heard about from people that write in necoda radio. They're like I

1245
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:42,920
I've been writing applications for this platform for my entire life now

1246
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:45,560
I want to write for linux and I have no idea where i'm supposed to start

1247
01:37:46,040 --> 01:37:49,480
Uh, do you have any advice and this is kind of like you would the idea here

1248
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:54,920
But you point them to this and to give the uh, the project credit like the guy quit his job, uh in the summer

1249
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:59,720
He's been working on it over the whole summer and the budget of 30 000 is also included like

1250
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:05,800
Going to conferences to talk about it with people and you know doing collaboration and stuff like that. I'm kind of impressed

1251
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:07,800
I think i'm gonna back it. It's not

1252
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,240
You're not impressed why you think it's just a text editor. What's the problem?

1253
01:38:11,320 --> 01:38:15,980
Do you want all my concerns about this in the form of a list or should I make a presentation?

1254
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:20,040
Wow, just give me the top give me your top three

1255
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:23,720
Okay. So first of all, if you want to contribute to any

1256
01:38:24,280 --> 01:38:30,680
Linux based projects regardless of your skill level if you just want to contribute go to the irc

1257
01:38:30,680 --> 01:38:35,240
Uh channel of that project and tell the guys that you want to contribute

1258
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:38,520
So that's how you have to do

1259
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:42,040
That's antiquated and painful. Yeah, and the thing is they don't know that a they don't know

1260
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:45,880
They don't they don't know that and b the thing is then what tool you tell them to go use

1261
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:47,960
What tool are they supposed to go use because they don't like that

1262
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:51,160
but no see that the thing is is like there it's

1263
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:57,160
It's hard for us to understand but there's one tool. It's causal. Well, I think I was gonna say vi, uh, no

1264
01:38:57,160 --> 01:39:02,200
No, if the the thing is is like you tell them that and that that to me makes sense

1265
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:06,840
But then when you tell developers that that I don't have any familiarity with the linux platform they glaze over there's too many options

1266
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:08,520
There's too many choices. There's no obvious path

1267
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:08,920
No, dude

1268
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:14,440
It works like this if you want to write for ios or you want to write for android go to this website create an account

1269
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:20,440
Download this single program and that's all you have to tell the developer and they can go make an app for that platform

1270
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:25,800
When they don't have to wait for someone in irc to like answer their question or hopefully get the same answer twice or whatever

1271
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:29,080
And when you or or have a holy war like oh you want to use eclipse?

1272
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:33,800
You should use vi like or no like they just need something and I totally agree with you

1273
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:34,920
I I think it's kind of silly

1274
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:39,560
But when I see it from their perspective I can see where builder fills that niche a little bit and it could you know

1275
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:41,720
Maybe help the developers get started

1276
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:47,480
Okay, but as far as I can tell from the video and from this the description on the project

1277
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:51,160
And this is my second point. Also, it doesn't really

1278
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:56,700
Help you it just in the search bar. It also searches the documentation

1279
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:00,920
And it's not really that impressive what you get is this

1280
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:06,360
unity scope style search of everything and it really

1281
01:40:07,160 --> 01:40:12,600
Distorted results because half the time the top result will not be what?

1282
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:15,720
Even in the category of what you're looking for

1283
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:22,120
They they well, it also has a ui designer as well and a few other like debugger and things like that in there

1284
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:24,120
So you have those tools already?

1285
01:40:24,440 --> 01:40:30,760
Yeah, we do. Um, and we have something like cute creator which does all of this already very nicely

1286
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:36,120
So but it's not gnome specific and they want something for gnome. That's why

1287
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:41,320
And there are gnome tools for c and c sharp with ui designers already

1288
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:44,680
Well, there's a difference between there are and are they good

1289
01:40:44,680 --> 01:40:49,240
In the video it specifically says they want one tool to do it all. Yeah. Well, yeah

1290
01:40:49,240 --> 01:40:54,920
Another thing is like a valid point. Yeah, is it it doesn't exist or is it good?

1291
01:40:54,920 --> 01:40:58,520
I have no guarantee that what this guy is making is going to be any better

1292
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:04,200
No, that's fair. It may it may suck toes, but it'd be interesting to see him try. Yeah, you know, what were your thoughts winnie?

1293
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:06,200
Is the order of things calm?

1294
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:11,080
Chris was talking about, um, you know building a tool that's going to help you build a tool

1295
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:16,120
Chris was talking about um, you know building something for linux

1296
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:21,320
Um, and I don't want to rag on this project because more development tools is a good thing as far as i'm concerned

1297
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:27,240
But this is a development tool that's aimed at building applications for gnome gnome 3

1298
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:30,220
And what poppy has described is an sdk

1299
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:35,560
uh that's designed to build, uh, uh applications for

1300
01:41:36,180 --> 01:41:37,380
ubuntu

1301
01:41:37,380 --> 01:41:42,920
Specifically ubuntu touch and what will become no, I think to create. Yeah. Yeah, so it's going to be you know

1302
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:45,480
Ubuntu in the future. No

1303
01:41:46,120 --> 01:41:52,040
Creator is independent of us. Yeah. Well, yeah, I know but it's it's ubuntu, isn't it? It's about making apps for ubuntu

1304
01:41:57,800 --> 01:42:03,880
I have to support wimpy here. The only time I used cute creator was to make apps for ubuntu

1305
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:07,720
No, no, no, it is not an ubuntu thing. But I think what poppy's or what wimpy's getting at is

1306
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:12,840
That's what poppy wants to see right? Yeah. Yeah, I mean no no no if I if I if I went meant to say that

1307
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:19,720
I would have said ubuntu. I agree. I specifically said cute creator. I think wimpy's it's already existing wimpy's having a go at you

1308
01:42:19,880 --> 01:42:21,880
Uh and one that I appreciate

1309
01:42:25,160 --> 01:42:27,080
I am pointing out that

1310
01:42:27,080 --> 01:42:29,080
Ubuntu is is

1311
01:42:29,080 --> 01:42:35,800
Heading down a road of you develop for ubuntu. You don't develop for linux you develop for ubuntu and that's no bad thing

1312
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:37,800
That's that's an admirable

1313
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:40,600
Objective, you know

1314
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:45,000
It's kind of a commercial objective and I can understand where those commercial pressures are going to come from

1315
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:48,440
But this is not that neither of these tools are addressing

1316
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:58,840
Uh developing for linux
