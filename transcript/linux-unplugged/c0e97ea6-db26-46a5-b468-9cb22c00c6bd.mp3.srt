00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 28 for February 18th, 2014.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,040
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's still raggin' high from

3
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,380
episode 300 of the Linux Action Show.

4
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,620
My name is Chris.

5
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:45,620
My name is Matt.

6
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,620
Hello there, sir.

7
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,620
Hello, Matt.

8
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,620
Hello.

9
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,320
We've been enjoying quite a good amount of feedback, a lot of positive feedback about

10
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,400
the announcement of our new show, How To Linux, which you're gonna be hearing more about

11
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,600
soon on all fine Jupyter broadcasting programming, I'm sure.

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,320
It's just so cool to see so many people so excited about something new like that, so

13
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,320
that's really gratifying.

14
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,320
Thank you, everybody.

15
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,520
Now look, we got a good show coming up today right here on Unplugged.

16
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,200
Later on, towards the end of the show, we're gonna do a giveaway.

17
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,300
We're gonna give away some games for the trivia that we announced in episode 300 of Linux

18
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,400
Action Show, so we'll get that taken care of.

19
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,820
We got some really good feedback about getting the younger generation into Linux, and also

20
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,720
we're gonna bring on Michael Hall.

21
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,040
He works at Canonical as, get this, Matt, the upstream liaison.

22
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,840
Ooh, oh, right on.

23
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,120
Yeah, that's, so, you know, could you imagine, like, you're at a bar and somebody says, you

24
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,120
say, what do you do for a living?

25
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,120
Oh, I'm an upstream liaison.

26
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,120
That just sounds cool.

27
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,520
Yeah, I mean, that's a great title.

28
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,160
So we're gonna bring him on because he just had a recent post today.

29
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:47,720
I guess he's been doing essentially a blog a day, and he's calling it a new 80-20 rule

30
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,720
for open source.

31
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,540
He says, put simply, the rule says that people will tend to appreciate it more when you give

32
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:56,280
them 20% of something and resent you if you give them 80%.

33
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,080
He says, I know, it sounds completely counterintuitive, but that's what I was seeing in all the conversations

34
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,600
around Mozilla and say things around Canonical and Ubuntu.

35
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,080
People by and large were saying that the reason Canonical and Mozilla were being judged so

36
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,360
harshly was because they already did most of what people wanted, which made them resent

37
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,440
when they didn't do everything.

38
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,520
What a great point, and I gotta tell you, I think that's something you and I have some

39
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,520
thoughts on.

40
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,520
Definitely.

41
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,880
I think there's multiple tiers to it, but I think the meat and potatoes of it is definitely

42
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:33,000
that people do develop an expectation surrounded with what they're presented with initially.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,840
So back when I was doing a lot of free Linux questions, I had people that were really upset

44
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,480
if I didn't respond within a certain period of time or if I didn't have time to respond

45
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,480
at all.

46
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,640
I mean, they would really feel offended, and I think that certainly translates as true

47
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,960
as in this space as well.

48
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,840
Yeah, and I could totally see how software developers find themselves in this position,

49
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,320
especially in an open community, so we'll talk about that coming up in the show.

50
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,760
And then if we have a little time, we've got a couple other topics we're going to jump

51
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:04,120
to as well as I want to help a fellow Linux-unplugged audience member who had a hard drive kind

52
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,120
of give out on him recently.

53
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,120
Oh!

54
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,120
Oh, I always feel bad for that.

55
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
I know.

56
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,560
So maybe we'll pick the mumble room and see what they think we could do for him.

57
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,360
But first, let's start with our feedback from last week's episode.

58
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,880
We like to try to keep a thread going between all of the episodes so that way if you listen

59
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,200
continuously, you kind of get a payoff there because we're not episodic.

60
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,120
We're not getting, we're not going to get some big deal from the networks like Star

61
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,880
Trek The Next Generation to where they couldn't have a nice storyline.

62
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,240
No, no sir, here we have storyline.

63
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,520
And our first email comes in from ExtraordinaryBenny says, hey Chris, Matt, and Chase.

64
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,520
Oh, look at this.

65
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,520
Chase is getting emails now.

66
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,520
Nice.

67
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,520
Good deal.

68
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,520
He's in.

69
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,520
Like the community is giving him a big hug.

70
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,520
That is awesome.

71
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:47,000
He's doing an AMA right now in the Linux Action Show subreddit too if you guys have any questions

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
for him.

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,560
My name is Ben and I'm a fellow Washingtonian.

74
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,560
Oh, nice, Ben.

75
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,360
He says, by the way, since there's other Bens in the ISC, you should probably just call me

76
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,360
ExtraordinaryBenny.

77
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,440
First off, I want to thank you guys for all of the effort you put into making such an

78
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,160
awesome content on Jupiter Broadcasting.

79
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,160
Thanks, Ben.

80
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,600
I was very excited when you announced the new How-To Linux show you're planning.

81
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,920
This is just the kind of thing the Linux community needs for newcomers or those who want to improve

82
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,280
their skills in Linux.

83
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,400
I was really surprised with the timing of your announcement because I was just thinking

84
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,440
about starting a website for Linux users that would be a repository of guides, how-tos and

85
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,880
what not for people to search, update and contribute articles to, similar to how DigitalOcean

86
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,880
has one for their community, but it would contain everything from customizing gnome

87
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,440
themes to setting up your own firewall.

88
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,880
Of course, this would probably be a far too great of a task to take on my own, but with

89
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,760
the new show coming into play, I think a community organized effort would make it possible.

90
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,840
He goes on to say, if we had a site like this to complement the show, I think it would be

91
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,040
a huge benefit for everyone.

92
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,200
I'd love to hear what you guys think from the JBU community of this idea.

93
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,200
ExtraordinaryBenny.

94
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,840
We hadn't really talked about this, but I do see value in something like this.

95
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,520
I think this is a great idea.

96
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,440
So ExtraordinaryBenny, we should chat more.

97
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,420
And I'd love to hear all ideas you guys have for the how-to show.

98
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:57,840
We're going to have in the future, as the show gets probably really just the next week

99
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,720
or two, you'll see these prop up in the Linux Action Show subreddit.

100
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,280
We'll start up some threads looking for your ideas and your feedback.

101
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,200
So keep thinking of this kind of stuff and we'll have some outlets for you to bring those

102
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,200
in.

103
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,320
And then also, as the show starts, we'll incorporate your feedback and any ideas you have like

104
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,320
that.

105
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,720
I think having a web resource, though, is a really great idea.

106
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,720
So thanks, ExtraordinaryBenny.

107
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,200
I'm not quite sure how we'd pull that off because the podcast production itself is such

108
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:27,880
a task that I don't know about also updating a website, but it seems really valuable.

109
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,920
I think that if it was done first of all Wiki style, I think that would be the first thing,

110
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,560
which means that it's done by the community.

111
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,560
We're hands off.

112
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,560
It's up to you guys.

113
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,920
I don't know if something like that was to take place to where it was based off show

114
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,280
notes and basically what was observed, perhaps.

115
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,280
I don't know.

116
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,280
That's going to be tough, though.

117
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,280
Yeah.

118
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,280
We'll chat more.

119
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,280
I think that's worth...

120
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,280
I think it's a great idea.

121
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,280
And I'd like to hear what the community thinks about it.

122
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,640
So Tom writes in, and this was really the topic last week that I thought really got

123
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,680
the most traction as far as our feedback goes, and we got a lot of emails in about this,

124
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,160
so I picked a couple that I came across and some other ones, I didn't get to all of them.

125
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,840
So Tom wrote, he said, this week, you had a younger listener write in about their experiences

126
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,360
and I thought I might add my perspective.

127
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,960
I'm slightly older than your writer, I'm 17, but I've been doing the same sort of things

128
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,960
since I was younger.

129
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,040
I had experienced similar problems in education.

130
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,800
My teacher is so poor, and I don't think he means in the money sense, I think he means

131
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,080
in the talent sense, that it's turned into a running joke.

132
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,360
There are at least three people in my class of 16 who could teach better, two of which

133
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,360
are J.B. listeners.

134
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,360
That's awesome.

135
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,240
Even worse, the curriculum for my computing A level is unimaginably out of touch.

136
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,880
For example, the operating system chapter is more about obscure batch processing systems

137
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:41,160
and considers operating systems which can multitask as notable than about topics relevant

138
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,160
to this decade.

139
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,160
Wow.

140
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,320
I think that there is no chance of people being taught useful groundings in schools

141
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,960
here in England without substantial change.

142
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:56,000
However, I have found that a very large number of my peers religiously follow gaming subreddits

143
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,240
and Valve.

144
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,780
With the Snowden revelations and Steam coming to Linux, I have noticed many more people

145
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,760
asking me to recommend a distro to try.

146
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,760
Very interesting.

147
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,760
For all the hard work you do and amazing shows, one Jupiter Broadcasting show is more educational

148
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,400
than a month of my A level classes.

149
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,400
That's funny.

150
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,960
Double win for you.

151
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,120
Yeah, that's pretty good.

152
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:25,240
Yeah, I felt like, so this is one of the reasons that I have been a proponent of gaming coming

153
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:31,220
to Linux, not because I like promoting a platform that sells commercial games that are restricted

154
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,220
by DRM.

155
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:43,920
That's not how I would prefer it, but I believe that humans, they like shiny things.

156
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,080
They will go to a lot of efforts to have a great gaming experience and it's fun for them.

157
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,080
It becomes a mission.

158
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,000
It becomes a quest to have the ultimate gaming experience, to have the most framerates, to

159
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,120
have the best sound, all of this, and to have your system be the most performant possible.

160
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,680
I think this is why gaming is important for desktop Linux, even though the vast majority

161
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,600
of Linux users today do not find themselves that interested by the gaming topic.

162
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,560
Boy, boy.

163
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,160
You know, I think you pretty much nailed it.

164
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,920
I definitely think that, because I know for myself, I try to limp along with my older

165
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,200
experiences, my older computers and whatnot, but I'm always yearning for that next greatest

166
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,200
latest thing.

167
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,200
I want the fastest phone.

168
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,240
I want the best computer.

169
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,560
So I think you really nailed it.

170
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:34,920
Yeah, and you know, if SteamOS and Linux become even a good option and Microsoft keeps cocking

171
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:39,320
it up with Windows, I mean, the two will come to meet and people will be driven and then

172
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,920
you have all these other ancillary issues like privacy and the cost and reinvestment

173
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,440
in hardware and all these kinds of things that also push people towards Linux.

174
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,120
So I'm positive in the freedom dimension about Linux's potentials, even when it's being used

175
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,240
to play proprietary games, because I believe the benefit of bringing more people to use

176
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:03,540
Linux just to get people on the desktop will improve the Linux desktop situation on a whole.

177
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,400
So even though what might have brought them, I guess what I'm trying to, the way to summarize

178
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:11,320
this is what might have brought them might have been that proprietary game that has DRM

179
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,780
that they paid money for, but then they end up staying in an open source ecosystem.

180
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:20,400
And I think that's the important part for the long run.

181
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,640
Well, I think so that really could translate into they came for the really fancy micro

182
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,240
brew beer and they, you know, and they stayed with the cheap stuff and the camaraderie of

183
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,240
the folks around them.

184
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,240
Yeah.

185
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,840
Well, cheap or cheap or low cost, you know, however you want to put it.

186
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,240
I'm not saying low rent, but low cost.

187
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,560
I like anytime we can try to get this close to a beer analogy because Washington's got

188
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,800
some great micro brews.

189
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,440
So I would love to do an episode of Linux Unplugged at a micro brewery, even though

190
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,040
it's completely unrelated to Linux.

191
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,600
I just, I want to do it.

192
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,720
So if you are in the area in Washington and you have a micro brewery and you listen to

193
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,040
this show, you should probably get ahold of us, email us, go over to jupiterbroadcasting.com

194
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,560
and click that contact link.

195
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,280
I want to do a show from your brewery.

196
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,760
I don't care if the sound's going to be bad, but I would like to drink a little bit of

197
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,760
your beer.

198
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,760
Just a little bit.

199
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,200
I can't drink a lot cause I, the gluten, but are we air quoting a little bit or are

200
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,200
we?

201
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,200
I'm serious.

202
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,600
Well, little is a, you know, that's, there's some flexibility in its definition you might

203
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,600
say.

204
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,600
All right, Matt.

205
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,540
Well, before we go into our next email, which is really a great stretch of a couple of emails

206
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,360
we'll get to, I want to thank DigitalOcean.

207
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,720
DigitalOcean is one of our sponsors for Linux Unplugged and DigitalOcean is simple cloud

208
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,340
hosting dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way to spin up your own cloud server

209
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,440
that you have root login to.

210
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,480
Users can create a cloud server in 55 seconds, although I believe the record right now is

211
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,640
44 seconds.

212
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,280
If anybody beats that, you got to let us know, but the record right now is 44 seconds, but

213
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,700
here's the best part.

214
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:54,360
Planning plans start at $5 per month for 512 megs of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU, and

215
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,920
a terabyte, yeah, a terabyte of transfer.

216
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,080
Now what you can do with these is endless because they have Ubuntu droplets you can

217
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,080
deploy.

218
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,580
They have Arch, CentOS, everything you might want like that.

219
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,600
They have ones preloaded with the LAMP stack, preloaded with Docker, et cetera.

220
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,720
You can create your own snapshots, back them up, redeploy them as you need them.

221
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,280
I just heard from somebody in our chat room today who used it to set up their own private

222
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,280
XMPP server.

223
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,280
So they have their own private chat server, right?

224
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:23,560
I'm using it for BitTorrent Sync, and I just set up a Pastebin alternative, an open source

225
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,440
PHP based Pastebin alternative that I might talk about in a future Linux action show.

226
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,000
I just tossed it up on my DigitalOcean Arch server, and it's been awesome.

227
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,440
They have a great connection, tier one bandwidth, paired with those SSDs, it really syncs.

228
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,960
DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Amsterdam, and now

229
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,160
Singapore.

230
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,080
With that simple and intuitive control panel, you'll be whipping right through there, and

231
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,600
good news, if you're a power user, you can actually replicate the functionality with

232
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,160
their straightforward API, build your own commands, build your own interface if you

233
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,160
need to.

234
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,440
I'll tell you what, you know, you bundle this with, we were talking earlier about Jitsi

235
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,840
and Jitsi's video bridge, and JITmeet and whatnot, you can run this on one of these

236
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,840
bad boys.

237
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,840
Yeah, perfect.

238
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,840
And you could essentially have your own Skype.

239
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,880
It'd be perfect, too, for a web RTC control server.

240
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,080
Look, go play with it, because we have a special offer for you.

241
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,720
Use the promo code LinuxUnpluggedFebruary, yeah, LinuxUnpluggedFebruary, that's all

242
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,720
one word.

243
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,080
You'll get a $10 credit over at DigitalOcean by using LinuxUnpluggedFebruary.

244
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,440
Now if you use the $5 machine, which I've been using for months now, months, if you

245
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,600
use the $5 machine, you're gonna get two months for free.

246
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:32,080
They got tons of great technology, powered by KVM, sitting on top of SSD hard drives,

247
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,520
tier one bandwidth, global image transfer, private networking in certain data centers,

248
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:41,080
an easy to use control panel, DNS management, resizing a server in a single click, backup

249
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,080
and snapshots, a web console, one click application installed, two factor authentication, and

250
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,960
a fantastic developer community, DigitalOcean.com.

251
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:53,000
Use the promo code LinuxUnpluggedFebruary, and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring

252
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
LinuxUnplugged.

253
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:03,120
All right, let's continue on this thread that we were talking about with the younger audience

254
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,520
getting into Linux and how they're kind of up against a lot of odds right now.

255
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,760
Daniel Ronin says, I don't think that Linux literacy is specific to today's generation,

256
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,120
illiteracy I should say.

257
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,320
It has always been like this.

258
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,520
It was the same back in the days when I was in school.

259
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:21,200
People in general are not interested in how stuff works, just that it does work.

260
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,680
This is changing though.

261
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,040
Before it was practically impossible to find any 14 year old doing Linux anywhere.

262
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,640
Now there are a couple of them in every city.

263
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:33,520
They might be alone in their school, but overall there are more youngsters doing it than before.

264
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,640
Steam will change this too, and it'll become even more common in the generations to come.

265
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:42,580
Schools are not doing Linux because it's not perceived as common enough, which is true.

266
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:47,920
Most workplaces do, Microsoft and its office suite, and as long as this is true, schools

267
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,920
will not change.

268
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:53,520
They are supposed to give kids enough basic knowledge to be able to handle a word processor.

269
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,520
That's what they do.

270
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,760
I don't agree with this, but it's the logic behind it.

271
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,200
Chromebooks and Google Docs are changing this now.

272
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,600
The future will not be desktops, tablets, or even phones.

273
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:10,720
It will be the internet of things, just like the Intel Edison, an SD card sized computer

274
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,780
which is about as strong as a Pentium 4.

275
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,780
Think about it.

276
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,680
A couple of generations of that, and you could make anything a phone.

277
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,680
It's a good point.

278
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,680
That's a really good point.

279
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,360
And I think that he nailed it when he said there's always going to be a couple of people

280
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,640
out of every town that are running Linux.

281
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:31,720
I walk into my local grocery store with my rocking new sweatshirt, and I'll tell you,

282
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,440
I had a couple of people, one person did recognize the show and kind of freaked out a little

283
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,440
bit.

284
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,440
No way, really?

285
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,440
Cool.

286
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,440
Yeah.

287
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,440
The other person recognized the Penguin and the Linux.

288
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,440
That was kind of cool, too.

289
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:47,280
So it's awesome that it all takes a couple of people to really help the growth happen,

290
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,280
I think.

291
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,280
Yeah.

292
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:55,440
And I think, too, we are stuck in an old generation's way of thinking where Microsoft and we're

293
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,520
thinking in the old paradigm.

294
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:02,160
And I think school districts are and all of the people that are making decisions on curriculum

295
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,160
are.

296
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,960
But the reality is, and this is why I've been, this is really what makes me excited about

297
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:14,640
Linux is not what it is today, but the fact that as technology becomes more general purpose

298
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:19,120
and these market leaders who were creating these specific technology empires like AIX

299
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,800
and System 390, etc., as they begin to fade, the general purpose technology that is cheaper

300
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,840
to implement, is more economical, more people have expertise on it, is easily deployable,

301
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:34,000
it has a lot of flexibility, that type of technology replaces those special one-off

302
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,360
tier types of technologies and Linux eventually ends up everywhere.

303
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:42,600
And this Internet of Things is a cute way of calling it that, but that's what it is.

304
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:48,360
And Linux will become relevant because everything will be running Linux that is a general technology

305
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,400
component.

306
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:55,440
And I think it's going to take a long time for schools to sort of work in how that's

307
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,840
incorporated into their curriculum.

308
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,680
And maybe it's through things like more like using the web browser and things like that.

309
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:07,880
I don't know exactly, but what we have today is a reflection of the old computer industry

310
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:13,080
and for better or worse, that industry is going through major redefinitions.

311
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:21,080
I just read a stat recently that average Joe and Jane Americans, like 70% of their computing

312
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,680
now is done on their quote-unquote tablets or smart devices.

313
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,680
Isn't that wild?

314
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,000
I mean, when you really, because you hear it and it kind of, you know, you don't really

315
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
think anything of it.

316
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It doesn't seem possible.

317
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Right.

318
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,360
When you're walking down the street, you go to a, maybe a, I don't know, a doctor's office

319
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,560
and you see tablets and phones, it's like a lot of these people are doing work from

320
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,560
these devices.

321
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:43,800
When you think about it, because the availability is higher, so they've always got it, right?

322
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,560
They've always got it with them so they can whip it out.

323
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,600
So there's more, the frequency goes up because they're whipping it out, man.

324
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,600
They're just whipping it out.

325
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
Whipping it out.

326
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,600
That thing is flopping around all over the place.

327
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,000
And I'll tell you those tablets and phones are in action.

328
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
That's right.

329
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,720
But there are also, they're simpler and they're easier and they're faster in a lot of senses

330
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,360
and they have less trouble.

331
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,040
So there's less resistance to just, I'll just grab it and check the Facebook feed real quick.

332
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,040
And it does make sense.

333
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,060
And maybe those computing activities that they're doing on those devices aren't all

334
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,060
that important.

335
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:15,640
They're not creating something, you know, they're not developing something, but it's

336
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,080
still usage.

337
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,760
And I think at the end of the day, that's what has Microsoft freaked out right now.

338
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,760
Oh yeah.

339
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,760
All right.

340
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,360
Our last bit of feedback this week comes in from Dakota.

341
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:30,100
Dakota writes in about Linux in schools and says, I'm 15 years old and I've been using

342
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,360
Linux for a year now.

343
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,280
I've done stuff from write my own code to compiling a custom kernel on Ubuntu.

344
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:40,200
I think we as a community should start a petition to get open source into more schools.

345
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,120
And like you talked about on Unplugged with the same other teens, I think the schools

346
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,720
should actually teach you something useful in the computer in IT classes.

347
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,960
It's really sad when there are kids out there like me who can teach the class better than

348
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,960
a teacher.

349
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,680
You know, that sentiment of teaching the class better than the teacher, which can come across

350
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:02,720
a little bit like the youngster knowing more than the teacher and these damn kids.

351
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,700
But in the same sense, I remember one of the reasons I wasn't super spun up about taking

352
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:15,080
more college level courses is because I quickly felt like I was outflanking my teachers and

353
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,080
knew more than they did.

354
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,140
And it was frustrating when the teacher would incorrectly cover something or say something

355
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:25,760
wrong or use the wrong terminology or write system D with a capital D. Bad example.

356
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,760
But you know what I'm saying.

357
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,920
It is very frustrating for these students.

358
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,440
So and it's interesting because we got a lot more emails than the ones I just read on air

359
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,040
and a lot of them iterated that point.

360
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,040
And there's a frustration there.

361
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:42,020
It seems like a trend of young people saying, hey, you know, don't give up on our generation.

362
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,020
We're here.

363
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,020
We're talking.

364
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,020
We're sharing.

365
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,560
We're teaching others that are willing to learn, maybe not the teachers, but you know,

366
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,560
certainly other students.

367
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,440
I'm almost coming to the conclusion that I think the future of Linux on the desktop in

368
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,120
a non-enterprise situations, perhaps at home, will be with young people.

369
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,000
I think that much like how Firefox had its adoption spread, I think it's going to be

370
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,160
young people that make it interesting, like mom and dad screwed up the computer.

371
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,560
Let me replace the OS with something that works just like these two at the browser.

372
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,120
Be like, oh, mom and dad, you're not using Firefox.

373
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,120
This is what your problem is.

374
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,120
Let me fix that for you.

375
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,120
Right.

376
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,120
Yeah, yeah.

377
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,120
You know what?

378
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,120
You might be right about that, Matt.

379
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:19,440
I would say, too, when I think about this, you know, looking at these these kids that

380
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:26,080
are really smart, I think that really there's two things that we have to realize is that

381
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,720
younger Linux users will find resources that we have out there for the adults like these

382
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,720
shows.

383
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,040
Like these shows, like when we make these, you know, we don't really have a specific

384
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,520
age group in mind, but we're definitely not trying to target a younger demographic.

385
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:43,360
But yet they still, obviously we have an audience that they, you know, they represent a percentage

386
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,720
of the audience that's noticeable.

387
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,360
And they are finding the same resources that we create for adults.

388
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,940
And I don't think we have to get in this mindset that we have to do something very special

389
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,940
for the kids.

390
00:19:53,940 --> 00:20:00,440
I think smart, savvy kids that are told it is okay, self-education is an okay thing.

391
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,480
If we can, you know, because a lot of kids, I felt when I was in school, I felt the Internet

392
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,480
was new, right?

393
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,600
And it was untrusted.

394
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,600
And there was pushback from my teachers when I would self-research and self-educate.

395
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,780
Like you can't rely on that.

396
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,440
You don't know if you're teaching yourself the right thing.

397
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,700
You're not smart enough to figure it out on your own.

398
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,980
You need our guidance is really what they were saying.

399
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:26,600
And now looking back on that, I resent that because self-education is a fantastic tool

400
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,960
and the Internet empowers people to teach themselves things on their own in their own

401
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,960
room.

402
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,960
Don't you think?

403
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,880
I think you really nailed on something there even bigger than just the experiences that

404
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,880
you had.

405
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,800
I think the problem is it represented the changing of a guard to where it was no longer

406
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,120
teachers who were the teachers essentially.

407
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,760
I mean they no longer were the power player or had all the knowledge that there's this

408
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:53,560
new thing that kids were quite frankly more adept to than the adults were.

409
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:58,320
I was at that time when this was happening I was pretty much on my own and out of school

410
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,400
and whatnot but I witnessed this happening a lot just in society that there seemed to

411
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,580
be a real shift.

412
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,600
And so I think that that's probably a lot of what you were experiencing.

413
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
Yeah.

414
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,140
And I think maybe that could still be there could be a little bit of that still in play

415
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:14,720
today because some of those same teachers are still in and they really are.

416
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,060
So I think if we tell these teenagers and kids that hey dude and dudette it's fine.

417
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,000
Go out there and learn on your own.

418
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Go teach yourself.

419
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,640
You don't have to have somebody's blessing to become educated on a topic.

420
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,640
That's right.

421
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,640
So all right.

422
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:38,100
So that wraps up our specific email feedback but I did have a little Valve update.

423
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:43,300
So we've been covering the evolving Valve story here on Linux Unplugged and big story

424
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:49,160
broke out actually just a couple of days ago that Valve was apparently monitoring people's

425
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:53,480
DNS cache and then parsing out where you had gone.

426
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,960
Anybody in the mumble room did you catch this whole story where Valve was supposedly looking

427
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,560
at people's… first it came out Valve was looking at your browsing history and they

428
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,360
were monitoring your browsing history and then it came out oh they're not monitoring

429
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,880
your browsing history they're looking at your DNS cache.

430
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,060
Did you guys hear this story?

431
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,240
Anybody here familiar with this?

432
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,240
Yes.

433
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,920
And also Gabe went to Reddit to kind of set it straight.

434
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,120
Now that was the interesting twist here.

435
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:20,320
So the way… so just to fill some of you guys in on the background I guess Valve has

436
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,600
been in this cold war, not even a cold war, a war with these cheats.

437
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:32,200
He wrote, Gabe wrote on Reddit there are a number of kernel level paid cheats relative

438
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,200
to this Reddit thread.

439
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,580
He links to the thread about a bunch of these kernel level cheats where like in Windows

440
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,960
it's almost like you know it's almost like malware in a sense.

441
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,760
He says, cheat developers have a problem getting cheaters to actually pay them for all the

442
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,120
obvious reasons.

443
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:50,320
So they start creating their own DRM and anti-cheat codes for their own cheats.

444
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,240
The cheats phone home to a DRM server that confirms that the cheater is actually paid

445
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,520
to use the cheat.

446
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:01,040
Now they have this program called VAC, V-A-C, it's a checker for the presence of these

447
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,040
cheats.

448
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:07,680
If they were detected, VAC then checked to see which cheat DRM server was being contacted.

449
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,080
Now here's how they do it and this is the part that got people upset.

450
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:17,800
The second check was done by looking at a partial match to those cheat DRM servers in

451
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,840
the DNS cache.

452
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:25,340
It found then hashes of the matching DNS entries were sent to the VAC servers.

453
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:29,320
The matches double checked on our server, this is Gabe talking, and the client then

454
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,920
marked it for, then the client was then marked for a future ban.

455
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:36,880
He says by the way less than one percent of clients, less than a tenth of one percent

456
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,440
of clients triggered the second check.

457
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,280
But this was, well hey, so wait a minute, Valve has been checking my DNS cache and then

458
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,680
doing hashes of it?

459
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,680
I didn't know this.

460
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,680
It's like they only read part of that, right?

461
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,020
But I mean they're not getting the deeper reasoning, so it's interesting.

462
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:54,440
It appears like there's a really big back and forth thing going on here and I just wondered,

463
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,400
did anybody in the mumble room feel like Valve has crossed a line by doing this DNS cache

464
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,400
checking?

465
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,400
No.

466
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:06,320
It was first reported, but then when it was explained, it wasn't as bad as it first seemed.

467
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,320
Yeah.

468
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,320
Yeah.

469
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,320
The whole thing is…

470
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,320
Go ahead, Rodden.

471
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,840
People thought that they were checking it, so if you just happened to go to the server,

472
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,840
you would get banned, but the second check is what explained that it wasn't doing that.

473
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:23,200
So even if you went to the servers for the cheat, you weren't being logged for doing

474
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,200
it.

475
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,200
Okay, yeah.

476
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,640
And I mean it's a hash too of the DNS cache, is that what you were going to say, Webby?

477
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,640
Webwizard?

478
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:38,600
No, I was just going to… I think they really needed to go and just be more forthcoming,

479
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:43,240
so that when people go and say, oh, look at what I found, and everyone just explodes,

480
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,640
start pointing fingers saying, oh, it must be doing something bad.

481
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,960
Well, I mean, before we go too far, I mean, Crash, don't you think that people are just

482
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,960
kind of taking Valve on their word on this whole thing a little too much?

483
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,920
That's exactly what I was just going to say, is that Gabe went and made a statement in

484
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:03,240
which he basically said, well, you know, you've got to trust us, and we don't want to break

485
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,240
your trust.

486
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,800
Yeah, trust us, just like Obama says.

487
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:12,540
He basically said, trust us, because if we were doing something bad, how would that look

488
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,540
for us and everything?

489
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:19,520
But at the moment, all we have is his word that that's all it's doing, and that it

490
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,560
isn't going to be used for anything worse, which, okay, there's no evidence that it

491
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:29,200
is doing anything worse, but we also know that the capability to scan your DNS cache

492
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:35,120
and send hashes of it exists in their software that only they can control, because they send

493
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,960
updates to Steam, and they're all closed source, and there's nothing, you can't check those

494
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:44,440
to make sure that it isn't doing anything else, so we've got Gabe's word, and he seems

495
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,920
like a trustworthy guy, but how do we know that?

496
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:52,680
I mean, lots of people seem trustworthy before this note, and leaks came out, so.

497
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,400
Rich Faye, what do you think this means for our state of privacy?

498
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:00,960
Well, I mean, maybe it's just this constant state of talking about it, but there's so

499
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,360
many companies that are ripping off your data online now, I mean, Google's the big player

500
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:12,320
there, that Valve seems like a pretty reputable company, and at least for me, I think I'm

501
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,980
going to take them at their word until I see a reason not to, just because it's just so

502
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:21,040
prevalent nowadays that, I mean, you can't just lock yourself in a room and not connect

503
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,040
to the internet.

504
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,040
Yeah, that's true.

505
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,760
Well, Ick, it sounds like you think this is a little bit, it came down to disclosure versus

506
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:33,320
PR, but could Valve really properly disclose this without then disclosing to the cheaters

507
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,680
how they're checking and catching them?

508
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,680
Well, not exactly.

509
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:42,560
What I'm thinking is, you know, if they would just disclose that there could be the possibility

510
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:48,000
of something like this happening, just a little bit of disclosure can solve a whole slew of

511
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,400
the PR problems that would happen in the wake of that.

512
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,400
Yeah.

513
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,400
You know what I'm saying?

514
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,400
Yeah, I do.

515
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,400
I mean, I'm glad...

516
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,400
Why does the operating system let it happen?

517
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,640
Well, that's a great question.

518
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,360
Why is there functionality to look in the DNS cache and see what's there?

519
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,760
Maybe to retrieve something from the cache, like if you want to...

520
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,760
That doesn't make any sense.

521
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,760
Like, the whole, it's supposed to be transparent, right?

522
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:11,120
You go to look something up and if it's cache it, yay, but why should you be able to see

523
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,240
what other programs have been looking up?

524
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,360
Yeah, maybe you can specifically look one particular thing up, but you shouldn't be

525
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,160
able to see what all of the entries are.

526
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,160
Right.

527
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,560
Well, you look something up and you might be able to tell by how fast the result comes

528
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,080
back, whether it was a cache hit or not, as like a timing attack, but you shouldn't be

529
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,000
able to just see what's in the cache.

530
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,600
And I'm not sure that they actually can, so I'm not sure exactly...

531
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,600
It could be disinformation.

532
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,600
Yeah.

533
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,600
Well, not disinformation.

534
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,600
It's just, you know, a bad explanation.

535
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,600
The PR is full of those all the time.

536
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,640
Yeah, and I wonder if this is a Windows-specific thing.

537
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,440
I wonder if they even can do this under the Linux client.

538
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:49,480
Yeah, like I wouldn't imagine there's some way to browse the DNS cache on a Linux client,

539
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,480
right?

540
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,480
Yeah.

541
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,800
I'm not familiar, but yeah, it's very interesting.

542
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,360
So we'll keep following it.

543
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,360
We'll keep watching it.

544
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,360
I just thought...

545
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,360
Oh, go ahead.

546
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:03,120
We thought they could have something built into SteamOS now because they're rolling that

547
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,720
out and I'm not sure if they've released open source code.

548
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,680
So I mean, they could eventually build something into that.

549
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,880
I mean, I think people will be able to tell if they're, you know, they could look at the

550
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,000
difference between the Debian version of, you know, LibDNS or whatever it is versus

551
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,920
the SteamOS version.

552
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:23,960
But it is, it does, your overall point is a good one in that them having their own operating

553
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,320
system opens them up to the possibilities of just baking these kinds of nice little

554
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,400
features in.

555
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,200
It definitely makes you take a pause and go, okay, I do need to remember that Valve is

556
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,220
a company and that they have their own motivations and that I need to be skeptical.

557
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:41,320
And I think that's a good healthy thing for all of us to think about right now.

558
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,520
But I definitely think so.

559
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:46,880
I think one thing to remember and first and foremost, never trust anything from any company.

560
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,500
That's just a good rule of thumb.

561
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:54,080
But that being said, I also look at motivation and how recent they are to a new market.

562
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,700
So I take Valve, like they're very recent to the Linux market.

563
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,240
So they're pretty new here.

564
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,400
Their motivation is to capture as many new users as possible.

565
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,840
And so pissing people off early on probably isn't a great game plan.

566
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:09,120
So based on those things at this point, I don't see anything with them doing anything

567
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,120
nefarious at this point.

568
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,560
That doesn't mean in the future.

569
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,560
But just saying.

570
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,640
I'll link to Gabe's full post in the show notes.

571
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,560
But one of the interesting things he said is that this little trick that they discovered

572
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:25,320
that they came up with only worked for 13 days until the cheat authors came up with

573
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,440
a new way to do it by purging the DNS cache.

574
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,180
Yeah, now the cheats just purged the DNS cache, which overall impacts your performance.

575
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,200
So that kind of sucks, you know?

576
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,200
All right, Matt.

577
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,680
Well, we're going to talk to Michael Hall here in just a second about a really great

578
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:43,480
post that he just had called the new 80-20 open source to, what did he call it?

579
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,480
Let's see.

580
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,380
He called it the new 80-20 rule for open source, which was a great post.

581
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,040
So we're going to talk to him here in just a sec.

582
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:55,480
But first, I want to thank our second sponsor this week, and that is the amazing folks over

583
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,480
at Ting.

584
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,440
Now, I've told you a lot about Ting.

585
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,440
Ting is mobile.

586
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,440
It makes sense.

587
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,440
It's no contracts.

588
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,440
It's pay for what you use.

589
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,320
I actually thought this week maybe I'd have one of their fantastic Canadians tell you

590
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,720
a little bit about it.

591
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,280
Ting keeps rates simple.

592
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,600
We don't make you pick a plan.

593
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,280
Instead, you just use your phone as you normally would.

594
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,360
How much you use determines how much you pay each month.

595
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,200
You can have as many devices as you want on one account.

596
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,360
That's good, because when you use more, you pay less per minute, message, or megabyte

597
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,360
of data.

598
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:29,600
Your usage plus $6 per active device on your account plus taxes is your monthly bill.

599
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,600
Simple.

600
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:34,400
That's what we mean when we say, Ting, mobile.

601
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,400
That makes sense.

602
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,320
Yeah, so go over to linux.ting.com to check them out.

603
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,040
They've got a really awesome dashboard.

604
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,560
I think all mobile carriers need to step up their game now.

605
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,960
Ting has schooled everybody on how your dashboard should work.

606
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,100
Web standards, so it works on your mobile device.

607
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,100
It works on your desktop.

608
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,200
They've also got iOS and Android apps that let you manage your account.

609
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,520
You can set up call forwarding, voicemail options, stuff like that.

610
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,100
They've got a really, really great customer service.

611
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:05,440
You can call them at 1-855-846-4389, and if you call them during business hours, a real

612
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,240
person answers the phone right then and there and takes care of your problem.

613
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,880
They've got some videos on their blog, too, some behind-the-scenes videos on the crew

614
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:18,000
that works in the support department, so you get a little idea of... Them Canadians, they're

615
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
so nice, Matt.

616
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
They're so nice.

617
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
They just posted one, I think, today.

618
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Yeah, today.

619
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,560
Yeah, I think it was today.

620
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,920
Yeah, so that video is up on the Ting blog.

621
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,280
While you're over at linux.ting.com, check out their savings calculator, because Ting

622
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,640
just dropped their rates.

623
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:36,120
The Ting deal is even better for data now, so go over there, plug in your current bill

624
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,640
information, and then just weep at the savings, my friends, because you'll be like, oh my

625
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:44,160
god, it's so much better, and oh, there's no contract, oh, I only pay for what I use,

626
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,700
oh, hotspot and tethering are included, oh my goodness.

627
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,600
By the way, they also have an early termination relief program.

628
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,360
You can find out more about that at ting.com slash ETF.

629
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,000
Get started by going to linux.ting.com, and that'll let them know that you heard about

630
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,800
it right here on the Unplugged Show, you appreciate them supporting the Unplugged Show, and my

631
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,960
friends, they'll get you $25 off your first device.

632
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,920
If you've already got a Sprint compatible device and they've got a BYOD page that outlines

633
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:11,240
everything, well then good news, they'll give you $25 off your first month, and if

634
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,360
you're like me, that actually ended up paying for my first month of Ting, and I really

635
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,360
love it.

636
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:20,200
I just, we were out, I can say this now, oh, I can talk about this now.

637
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:25,560
So Matt, Chase, and I were out in the car, right, and we're driving around, and Chase

638
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:31,020
doesn't have Ting, right, because he originally had an iPhone, and he wanted to, he has another

639
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,000
mobile carrier who likes to spy on you and give all your information to the government

640
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,640
and extract as much money from you as possible.

641
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,400
Anyways, that carrier is pretty well known, so Chase says, well, let's do a speed test

642
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:45,240
and see where we're at, and so we both bring up the speed test app.

643
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:49,920
I had perfectly good pings, perfectly good speeds, and I'll tell you, I'm paying $33

644
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,980
a month, Chase is paying like $120 a month, we both have two phones on the account, so

645
00:32:54,980 --> 00:33:01,640
the value in Ting is just incredible, so linux.ting.com, and thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Linux

646
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,640
Action Show.

647
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,640
I'm just kidding, Chase.

648
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,640
I know.

649
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,640
He's like, hey!

650
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,520
He's like, hey, come on now, come on now, no, Chase, it's cool, it's cool, man, it's

651
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,520
cool.

652
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:14,680
Alright, well, let me bring Michael Hall into our restricted casting room here, and Michael,

653
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,000
welcome to Linux Unplugged.

654
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Thank you, guys.

655
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,120
So you had a really great post this morning on your blog, emhall119.com, and you said

656
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:28,240
it's a new 80-20 rule for open source, so before we get into that, I noticed, are you

657
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,760
trying to do like a blog a day kind of a thing right now?

658
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:37,120
Yeah, there was some conversation at the end of January about the content going on on Ubuntu

659
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,960
Planet, and I came up with this, well, I didn't come up with it, I stole this idea of doing

660
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,400
a blog a day for a month.

661
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:47,760
So you're hoping to sort of populate the Ubuntu planet with some reoccurring content every

662
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,360
day kind of a thing?

663
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:54,160
Yeah, I was just trying to get people to kind of blog more actively on it.

664
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,440
So what do you do at Canonical?

665
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:02,500
Well, as you mentioned earlier, my official title is Upstream Liaison, but I really haven't

666
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:07,200
been doing a lot of upstream liaising lately, I've been doing a lot of app developer focus.

667
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,120
Uh-huh, yeah, I bet, as you guys are ramping up the Ubuntu Touch effort, right?

668
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:15,500
Yeah, and the Ubuntu SDK, it's really a lot of exciting stuff going on.

669
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:19,280
What has got you most excited right now?

670
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,480
Everything around the app development and the phone.

671
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:26,280
I mean, I've got a Nexus 4 that's running Ubuntu, and it's been my primary phone since

672
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,200
August of last year.

673
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:35,560
And just the workflow using the phone is so much better for me than what Android was.

674
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,120
So is that really, I mean, the essence of that is, you know, because so many people

675
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:42,200
when we talk about the mobile market, so many people talk about, oh, you know, Android's

676
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:46,600
there, they're the new Windows, they're dominant, the market's all locked down, but you're telling

677
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,640
me that you sit there, you're using this thing, you're like, you know what?

678
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,760
This works for me?

679
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,760
And that's what's got you excited?

680
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,960
It's like, I see this fitting into my workflow, and do you think this is like a whole new

681
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,080
generation of opportunity for Ubuntu?

682
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,080
I think it is.

683
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:04,440
The one, the thing we have over everybody else in the market right now is that we're

684
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,020
running the same software on the phone as we are on the desktop.

685
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:12,560
So it's not like, you know, you've got completely different platforms like you do with the iOS

686
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,920
and OSX, or even Windows and Windows Phone, and of course, you know, Android, there's

687
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:22,160
not even anything on a desktop space with Android, there's Chrome OS.

688
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,560
So being able to have just the one platform on all the devices, being able to have the

689
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:31,760
same apps on all your devices is really, it really changes the experience of it.

690
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:37,200
So changing gears to your blog post here, I know you've been active at Canonical for

691
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,080
a long time, you've been in the open source community for, do you have a rough estimation

692
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,880
of like how long you've been in?

693
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:49,600
I've been involved with the Ubuntu community for probably six, seven years now.

694
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:54,440
And so you've had time from that perspective to sort of notice trends as they come and

695
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:58,720
go, you know, the big hoopla's of the week that sometimes last multiple weeks, sometimes

696
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:03,100
fizzle out fairly quick, and I thought, you know, you had a really poignant piece when

697
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:07,480
you wrote here on your blog, people tend to appreciate it more when you only give them

698
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:13,120
20% of something, and then they resent you if you give them 80%.

699
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,680
Let's unpack that a little bit.

700
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:19,400
When you say people resent you, people appreciate it more when you give them 20%, that sounds

701
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,600
crazy to me.

702
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:24,480
That sounds ludicrous, what do you mean by that?

703
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:30,360
It does sound ludicrous, but what I realized is that at some point past the 50% mark, I

704
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:35,520
just chose 80-20 because, you know, the 80-20 rule's a common thing, but at some point after

705
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:40,440
you've given them more than half, people start to think of it as something that they're entitled

706
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,180
to or something that already belongs to them.

707
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:46,400
And so instead of looking at what you're giving them, they're paying more attention to what

708
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,920
you're not giving them.

709
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,260
Oh, interesting.

710
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:55,960
So it's sort of like what Matt was saying, it's one part expectations and two part what

711
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,440
have you done for me lately?

712
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,240
Yeah, it is.

713
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:03,340
And as people have mentioned on my blog, there's another aspect of that and that's, you know,

714
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,120
what direction are you changing in?

715
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:11,720
I mean, if somebody goes from giving 10% to giving 20%, that's better than somebody who's

716
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:15,080
gone from giving 90% to giving 80%.

717
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:20,300
And that's a valid criticism of my original blog post is that the direction of change

718
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,280
does matter as much as where you're currently at.

719
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,280
Sure, sure.

720
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:30,780
But I think this is fascinating in the recent light of Firefox's announcement of enabling

721
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,560
ads on their new tab page.

722
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:37,880
And part of it, like Matt made a very good point last on Sunday, that part of it is honestly

723
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,560
how they announced it.

724
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:45,080
And part of it is, I think, what the phenomenon that you're writing about on your blog is

725
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:48,880
that, wait a minute, you're telling me I've gotten this thing all this time for absolutely

726
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,100
free, with no ads attached.

727
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:55,320
You guys are the anti NSA, anti ad tracking cookie organization on the internet and now

728
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,520
you want to ram ads down my throat?

729
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,000
How dare you?

730
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:06,160
This maybe while it doesn't surprise all of us, Michael, how do you combat something like

731
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,160
that?

732
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,160
Because Firefox has got to make money.

733
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,200
What can Firefox do?

734
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,560
It's really a tough question.

735
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:17,640
I mean, obviously, it's a question that we've been trying to figure out in Canonical also.

736
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,620
And I think a lot of it is getting the messaging right.

737
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:24,720
But a lot of it is just the community needs to understand that every project is going

738
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,720
to have missteps.

739
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:32,800
And if somebody's been doing 80, 90 percent right for so long, you have to be a little

740
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,240
more gentle when they have those missteps.

741
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,200
Well, let me give you an example.

742
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:45,680
So Linux Unplugged, this very show that we are currently recording at this very moment,

743
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,880
is a symptom of this problem that you're talking about.

744
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:55,440
I knew that I needed to make changes, even just from a creative expression standpoint,

745
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,160
to the Linux Action Show.

746
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:01,440
But I also knew that we had a really great product that was firing on all cylinders and

747
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,600
has a ton of runway still.

748
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:09,960
And I knew that if I changed that product to what this show is, there would be massive

749
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,320
upset.

750
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,880
And so my solution was to create an entirely new product.

751
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:20,520
Now that has been wildly successful for multiple reasons, but it was exactly this kind of pressure.

752
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:25,120
And we made the mistake years ago with the Linux Action Show when we decided to broaden

753
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,340
the scope and change it to the Computer Action Show.

754
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:34,960
And we basically took a beating for an entire season over that decision because we had changed

755
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,080
the product.

756
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:41,640
And the problem is, at some times, at some level, you've got to change the product.

757
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,280
Apple, they changed the product with Final Cut.

758
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,400
They changed the product with the Mac Pro, right?

759
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:52,120
Two recent products from Apple that are used in professional industries, completely gutted

760
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,480
and redesigned from the ground up with less functionality.

761
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,920
But yet, in the long term, we'll probably be better off for it.

762
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,480
As somebody who uses Final Cut for editing, I can tell you, everybody who uses Final Cut

763
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,680
10 as crap hasn't used it recently.

764
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,680
I just recently went back to the old Final Cut.

765
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,920
It's like going back to the 90s.

766
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,880
It's like when you've been using Gnome 3 or Unity and you go back to Gnome 2, it feels

767
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,600
like you've gone back in time.

768
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:20,340
And sometimes, a lopping off like this, a major change, implementing ads, implementing

769
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:25,700
the Amazon search scope is necessary for the sustainability of the project.

770
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:29,220
The very people who depend on the project are then the ones that turn around on the

771
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,720
project and attack them.

772
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:35,360
What can a project do, do you think, in your opinion, to communicate that change better

773
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:39,900
so that way they can sort of preempt some of that attack?

774
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:43,080
So a lot of it has to do with the messaging that goes into it.

775
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:47,080
But another thing that I've noticed that I didn't really expand on in my blog is that

776
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:52,920
there's a difference in reaction between people who are just users of the project and people

777
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,360
who are contributors of the project.

778
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:00,720
And people who are contributing seem to be more understanding, be more willing to work

779
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:07,320
out an ideal solution instead of just jumping on the, oh my god, you're evil now, bandwagon.

780
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,240
So I guess what I don't understand is why can a company, just giving you my example

781
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:15,120
I set up here, why can a company like Apple reboot something, cut away tons of functionality

782
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,760
and be called an innovator?

783
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,760
But if an open source project does the same thing, they're crazy, they've lost their

784
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:26,160
way, they're evil, they're whatever people are accusing Canonical or Mozilla of that

785
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,160
week.

786
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:32,580
It seems to me, Canonical has people that deal with PR, they've got a pretty good presence

787
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:35,960
online and yet they have been unable to get in front of this.

788
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:41,580
Mozilla, same thing, they have an entire crew that works there and they were still unable

789
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,680
to get in front of this.

790
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,760
Matt, I want to ask you, because I know you've worked in this space before, what are these

791
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,560
people missing?

792
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,160
What is Mozilla missing in this case?

793
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,160
What did they do wrong?

794
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,360
What should they have done before the news came out?

795
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:57,880
Well, the big difference between Mozilla and Apple is Apple sells experiences, Mozilla

796
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,880
offers a browser.

797
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,680
A lot of people think that Apple is a computer company or a technology company.

798
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,680
They're not.

799
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,240
They're a PR company, pure and simple.

800
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:09,960
They've mastered this years ago and so they could literally be like, hey, we have this

801
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,800
iHome invasion thing where we're going to come in and basically invade your house and

802
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,800
ransack everything you own.

803
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,380
People are going to be excited about it because they can present it in a way that's attractive.

804
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:22,360
What Mozilla needed to do when they came out with their whole advertising thing for browsers

805
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:26,040
and whatnot is they really needed to get in front of this and say, here's our rationale,

806
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,840
here's how we've been supporting ourselves thus far, here's what we're challenged with,

807
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,560
this is what we're planning on doing.

808
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:35,560
We would like to have an open forum debate about this and actually get all the questions

809
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:39,600
out in the open and really have a conversation about it, but at the same time, we need you

810
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:43,800
to understand why we're doing it, why it is or is not a threat, why you should or should

811
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,800
not be concerned, and to quit treating people like they need to be talked at and actually

812
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,960
talked to them.

813
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,880
That's something that historically geekier companies don't do real well at.

814
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:59,360
Google, Mozilla, two real big offenders in that space, probably Google being the worst.

815
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:05,200
I see it over and over and it's something that's not really addressed very well.

816
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,040
I've seen other companies do this as well, but I'd say Apple, honestly, as much as I'm

817
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,480
not a big fan of their company, they can spin anything.

818
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,480
Right.

819
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,520
They control the narrative from the very beginning.

820
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,520
Absolutely.

821
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,520
And props to import.

822
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,520
I mean, really.

823
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,520
I mean, they know how to do it.

824
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,640
So rather than everybody yelling at how horrible Apple is about it, let's look at what they're

825
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,640
doing right.

826
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,360
I mean, the products aren't kind of meh, but as far as their marketing techniques, come

827
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,360
on.

828
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,360
Let's get with it.

829
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:32,760
So Michael, what do you think about like, so if we don't have the means and resources

830
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:37,960
of a company like Apple, these smaller, even Mozilla would fall into the smaller category.

831
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:41,200
What about being just more direct?

832
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,240
And I'm not asking you as a representative of Canonical here.

833
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:46,760
I'm asking just your personal opinion of somebody who's been following open source for many

834
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,920
years now.

835
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,780
Do you think that if a company like Canonical come out and said, hey, we're doing these

836
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:57,020
Amazon placements in our dashboard results because honestly, we've got to generate a

837
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:59,520
revenue from the desktop in order to keep it sustainable?

838
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,000
Or if Mozilla had come out, maybe let's take a more recent example.

839
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,280
If Mozilla had come out and said, look guys, we can't have all our eggs in the Google basket.

840
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,580
We respect our relationship with Google and we appreciate the financing they've given

841
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:17,160
us so far, but we've got to diversify because this browser is more important than one contract

842
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,640
with one company and we've got to implement these ads to come up with a new source of

843
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,640
revenue.

844
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:26,800
If they had just been totally straight, plain English like that, do you think things would

845
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,700
have gone over better?

846
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:32,200
I think it would have helped, but I mean, you're always going to have people who would

847
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:36,380
rather see your project go down in flames than have you backtrack a little bit from

848
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:39,800
their ideal and you're always going to deal with that.

849
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:44,480
There's no way to explain things sufficiently for those people.

850
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:50,160
But one thing we did do, when we came out with the Amazon lens in 12.10, it just kind

851
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:55,760
of landed out of the blue with no explanation of why it was there or what it does and we're

852
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,920
still dealing with that even today.

853
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:05,280
But then the next release, we came out with the broader SmartScope service and we came

854
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,820
out first with a public spec on our Wiki.

855
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:14,620
We held multiple Google Hangouts that were recorded explaining what the feature was going

856
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:16,920
to be and what it was going to do and how it's going to work.

857
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:17,920
And the security improvements.

858
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,400
Yeah, and the security improvements.

859
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,280
And that certainly helped.

860
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:28,760
I mean, if you can get the narrative right from the start, that helps.

861
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:33,640
As soon as the FUD comes in and establishes itself, you're going to spend all of your

862
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,400
time just trying to fight that.

863
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,400
Yeah, great point.

864
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:43,640
Boy, that is a really well-taken point and I wish there was a way to sort of reinforce

865
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,880
this with the open source community because I'll give you another recent example I talked

866
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,200
about on Coda Radio yesterday.

867
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,680
I want to say for the show, although he's never come on, I'd love to have him join us,

868
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:59,560
but Martin, who is responsible for the Kaywin project, he continues to battle this problem.

869
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:03,480
We talked about it several weeks ago here on the show where the media grabs a headline

870
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,560
from the KDE mailing list and just runs with it.

871
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:14,960
First, we inaccurately reported that the KDE Next release date, but more recently, because

872
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:19,240
of my lessons learned, I did not run it in last, thankfully, but more recently, Ferronix

873
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:25,040
ran a story that the KDE search system was a waste of money and that it's being abandoned

874
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:29,920
in favor of something completely else, which is inaccurate in total and of course not everything's

875
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:34,120
being abandoned and of course recode is going to be repurposed, but again, they're fighting

876
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:38,280
a battle that you just touched on, Michael, where they're responding to a narrative that

877
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,080
somebody else created for them.

878
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:44,480
This is happening more and more for open source projects because, and this goes back to something

879
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,600
else I've been really getting on recently, the coverage in Linux and the open source

880
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,320
space is going downhill.

881
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:58,040
It's becoming industrialized and it's becoming, it's not original reporting, it's reposting

882
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:03,360
based on what a corporation wants you to post and it's getting worse and there's agendas

883
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:07,600
involved and it's getting to the point where not all of the information is coming out and

884
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:11,100
the press is not giving the actual narrative a chance to get aired out.

885
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:14,880
The only narratives that are getting repeated by the media are the ones that get created

886
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:15,880
first.

887
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:19,880
This is a massive problem that is plaguing Linux and open source and it affects the way

888
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:23,440
the entire open source community perceives events, I believe.

889
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,080
I think it's one of the things that I want to set out to help correct on our platforms

890
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:32,120
any shows that we have is that I want to try to give the actual real narrative a chance

891
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:35,520
to get some airtime because nobody else seems to be doing it.

892
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,720
That's why I wanted to bring you on, Michael, because I really appreciate the fact that

893
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:43,400
you're, even if, there are some things I could disagree with on your post here.

894
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,400
You've actually generated a very active discussion on our subreddit.

895
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:51,800
People are taking issue with minimizing the CLA and things like that, but I want to save

896
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,720
the CLA discussion for a future episode.

897
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:58,760
I'll just say, I want to thank you for bringing this topic out to a broader discussion because

898
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:05,600
I think the problem really has to be solved with the actual consumers of these open source

899
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:06,600
projects.

900
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:12,320
It is our responsibility to consider the long-term viability of these projects.

901
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:18,080
I extend that to our own projects and our advertisers and why we have ad-supported media

902
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,720
because that makes it sustainable.

903
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:24,160
I think we have to consider the software we consider valuable, and when they make changes,

904
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,960
we have to understand that sometimes they're doing it for their best interest, in the case

905
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:32,480
of the Mozilla project, and perhaps even in the case of the Dash Lens results.

906
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:36,420
I think in that context, your post, while I think there's plenty of things people could

907
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:38,840
quibble with, it definitely provokes some interesting thoughts.

908
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,640
Thank you for coming on Linux Unplugged today.

909
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,960
Is there anything else you want to touch on before we wrap up?

910
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:47,440
No, I think that's it, as long as we stay away from the CLA topic, I'm happy.

911
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,440
Okay, all right.

912
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:49,440
We'll stay away.

913
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,440
We'll stay.

914
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,440
We'll stay.

915
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,560
I've been planning to save that for a future show, so what I'll do is I'll toss you up

916
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:57,360
into the main mumble room here.

917
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:01,280
Now, anybody in the mumble room, go ahead and let me know if you had anything you wanted

918
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,160
to touch on this, but I wanted to zoom out as we kind of wrap up here, guys, before we

919
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:09,000
get to the hard drive recovery thing that I want to get to before the show ends.

920
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,240
What do you guys think?

921
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,240
Looking at this, you've probably all witnessed these kinds of things where the community

922
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:19,280
gets really upset about something that sort of is necessary, and I'm willing to say the

923
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:24,800
perhaps I've been too critical of the Unity Dash results, especially now with the security

924
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,280
improvements that have been made.

925
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:29,280
You got to make something sustainable.

926
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,280
What do you guys think?

927
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:35,800
Chris, I want to take something actually Matt said and take it one step further when he

928
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:39,860
was comparing Apple with open source companies specifically on this topic, and that's Apple

929
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:41,440
stands as like an authority.

930
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,360
They make decisions, and we don't have a choice in them.

931
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,920
They're kind of like our parents in a way.

932
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:49,200
There's nothing we can do, whereas open source companies, we've helped them grow.

933
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:53,840
We've helped nourish them over the years, so for us, they're more like friends.

934
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:58,880
We feel personally attached to these companies because we've been there from when Firefox

935
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:04,360
started till now, and in a way, because we've been there for that long and we've been there

936
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:08,560
to support them and nourish them, we feel like we have a personal stake not only in

937
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:12,920
their successes but also in their failures, and when they do make missteps, I think we

938
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:19,080
kind of take it a little more personally because we want to be the open source banner of what's

939
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:23,760
right, and when we see that, we see that as our community as a whole faltering, not just

940
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:24,760
Firefox faltering.

941
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:30,960
And we invested our time and our energy because their ideals aligned with our ideals, right?

942
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,440
And so when those ideals deviate from our ideals, we feel a little bit robbed because

943
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,000
that wasn't the original bargain.

944
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,360
Is that what you're saying?

945
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,360
Is that what you're saying?

946
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:41,360
Yeah.

947
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:44,440
So go ahead, Crossroads, because you said it was bad enough when it was just Amazon.

948
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,440
What did you mean?

949
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:52,440
No, what I meant was that it was bad when it was only Amazon because when it's only

950
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:58,800
Amazon, then it appears as ads in 1310 once they had smart scopes and it covered plenty

951
00:50:58,800 --> 00:50:59,800
of sources.

952
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:00,800
At that point, it became okay.

953
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:01,800
Gotcha.

954
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:02,800
Go ahead, Riley.

955
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,880
I think the thing is just ads itself.

956
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,320
Ads are never a cool thing, no matter what it is.

957
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:14,880
I don't care who you are, if you say you're going to introduce ads, there's always going

958
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:20,880
to be people who say no and scream at you.

959
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,000
You can all have the best PR in the world, but if you introduce ads, it's still a bad

960
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,560
thing to a lot of people and there will always be those people who hate you for it.

961
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:33,560
So you've got to take that with a grain of salt.

962
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:37,600
You win some and you lose some.

963
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,160
I would take that because I agree with that, actually.

964
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,440
I think that's a spot on statement.

965
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:44,520
I'd take it even further and say part of what Apple does to make their own efforts successful

966
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:47,800
too is that they're choosing their battlefield.

967
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:52,640
So they're picking people that won't be as likely to object as folks that will by going

968
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:56,920
to the Tube TV versus exclusively going online.

969
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:01,080
They're working with people that are already comfortable being bombarded with crap and

970
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,280
aren't going to react as poorly.

971
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,600
Well, I mean, so Ick, what do you think?

972
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:09,080
You say maybe it's a necessary evil to have these ads.

973
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:10,080
Absolutely.

974
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:15,760
And the reason is, is because people have to be able to make some sort of income.

975
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:20,240
It doesn't matter if you are, you know, I've dealt with nonprofits for a good chunk of

976
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:27,000
time myself in my professional career and they have to have some income somehow.

977
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:32,720
The thing is now there is a line that can be drawn at Lampy2 in the chat room did mention

978
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:33,720
it.

979
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,140
Just don't track me.

980
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:38,640
It's when you start getting followed around the internet and you're browsing.

981
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,840
Yeah, that's exactly a line of privacy being crossed.

982
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:45,520
Daredevil, do you think there's an alternative to ads?

983
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:52,120
Yes, I think there's many models that that can work and then can be put into test.

984
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:59,080
Ads has been the model that is mostly used because it reduces costs and you can actually

985
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:02,580
sell even if you're selling something, you can sell it at a lower rate and expect to

986
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:04,600
gain those profits later.

987
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:08,920
But I don't think it's the only model and people should try to look a little bit also

988
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:14,440
and risk on models, business models, not only on development models, but business models

989
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:15,440
as well.

990
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:21,280
I kind of want to dovetail on that a little bit because we're still within that topic.

991
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:27,080
When I was looking at what Firefox is doing, you know, they're getting most of their income

992
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,080
from Google.

993
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:31,600
Well, what if Google decides to pull out on that agreement?

994
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:35,100
Then they have to come up with their revenue some other way.

995
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:40,360
And you know, the thing is, they're only getting one percent, actually less than one percent

996
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,600
of their revenue from donations.

997
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:46,760
So that becomes a problem when you're not going to be making as much money to be all

998
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,520
your developers.

999
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:58,280
I think Mozilla is going to have hate thrown at them either way.

1000
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:06,320
So really like Apple's done is they actually just make the product, throw it out there,

1001
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:09,560
see how it sells and just go with that.

1002
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:12,200
Like no way.

1003
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:17,120
So Daredevil and I know, you know, so I'll tell you, you think maybe donations aren't

1004
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,160
the model, but God, don't we all want them to be?

1005
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:22,760
Don't you want the people who are consuming the thing to be the people who finance the

1006
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:23,760
thing?

1007
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,760
What are your thoughts?

1008
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:25,760
Yes.

1009
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:34,160
I agree exactly that and actually, for example, I quite appreciated when Ubuntu had this button

1010
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:39,240
that when you were to download, you could actually vote with your wallet where the money

1011
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,240
goes to.

1012
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,240
Yeah.

1013
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,760
And I think that's actually much better.

1014
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:50,300
And let's say you make three months or just a limited time where people get this.

1015
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:54,760
They can get the source code as well while they download and they get the paid version.

1016
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,480
They just pay for the product.

1017
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,480
It's a license.

1018
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,800
And then after that time, it actually gets released for everyone.

1019
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,280
That's another model, for instance.

1020
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,640
Now, Mr. Hall, I know you had a response to Art of Music's point.

1021
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:06,640
Go ahead.

1022
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,640
Go ahead.

1023
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,680
Can you hear me now?

1024
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:10,680
Okay.

1025
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:14,240
So you mentioned that, you know, the Apple approach is to just throw something over the

1026
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:17,060
wall and be done with it that way.

1027
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:21,400
And I think part of what I wanted to stress in my blog post was that if we keep going

1028
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:26,960
after the companies that are doing mostly right so harshly, we're going to drive more

1029
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,900
people in the opposite direction, that we're going to drive them to the Apple approach

1030
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:35,000
where they just throw it out there and say, here it is, use it or don't.

1031
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Good point.

1032
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,680
Now, Riley, I wanted to shift gears to you because I know you had an idea about a Mozilla

1033
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:42,680
service.

1034
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:43,680
Tell me about this.

1035
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:44,680
Yes.

1036
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:49,880
How about instead of maybe ads, how about you start offering some like streaming services

1037
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:55,240
or cloud storage services, like things like that, you can join revenue from like subscription

1038
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:56,720
big type things maybe.

1039
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,000
For the sync or something.

1040
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,120
Well, I'd say privacy services would probably be the most logical course.

1041
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,120
Yeah.

1042
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,120
Exactly.

1043
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:04,120
I mean, VPN service.

1044
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,120
That would be excellent.

1045
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,120
Yeah.

1046
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,120
I can see that.

1047
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,120
People have a trust there.

1048
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,120
I don't know.

1049
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,120
I think I kind of fall down with you, Crash Benedict.

1050
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:14,320
Crash Benedict, you say, hey, Opera, Safari, these guys have been doing this since day

1051
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,320
one.

1052
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,800
But how successful are they?

1053
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:21,800
The actual proposal that they made was that on a brand new install of Firefox, you know,

1054
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:25,120
you get the new tab page with the nine squares on it.

1055
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:32,920
All they're going to be doing is giving companies the ability to be put on that before the user

1056
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:35,040
has actually filled that up with their own thing.

1057
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:39,120
So until you've visited your first nine websites on a brand new install, you're going to see

1058
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,120
those defaults.

1059
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:41,120
Right.

1060
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:44,120
But then eventually, you would even replace them with your own sites that you frequent.

1061
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,120
Exactly.

1062
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:48,520
And, I mean, I recall installing Opera way back when.

1063
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:51,620
This was like five, six, seven, eight years ago.

1064
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:55,440
And they had, you know, the page with all the different tiles on it.

1065
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:59,560
And when you installed it, you'd open it and they'd have links on that to Facebook and

1066
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:02,080
Google and YouTube and whatever, Wikipedia and stuff like that.

1067
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:05,840
It was just some default sites that they suggest to you.

1068
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:08,680
And the mobile Firefox does the same thing.

1069
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:11,720
When you open it for the first time, it has some default things.

1070
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,600
See, this goes to Michael's point.

1071
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:20,120
I think if Firefox, I mean, tell me if I'm wrong here, Michael, but if Firefox had shipped

1072
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:24,320
the browser from day one when they invented this new tabs page, the first time it went

1073
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:29,600
out, if they just signed up agreements and populated it, no one would give a crap.

1074
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:30,600
That's it.

1075
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,600
Right?

1076
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:32,600
Nobody would care.

1077
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,180
It would not even be a topic of discussion.

1078
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:39,320
But because they're changing the deal after we've already all made the deal, after we've

1079
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:43,320
all done some sort of imaginary handshake, now it's a big deal.

1080
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,360
Now we're all upset.

1081
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,600
Now we're all butthurt.

1082
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:50,400
Instead, we'd rather they have some sort of deal with Google, but God forbid they make

1083
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,720
money directly.

1084
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,640
I prefer that, to be honest with you.

1085
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,580
I prefer that they're not attached to Google at the hip.

1086
00:57:57,580 --> 00:58:01,400
Maybe someday we'll see DuckDuckGo as the default search if they're not getting $300

1087
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:04,120
million a year from Google.

1088
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,120
Maybe DuckDuckGo gets product placement now.

1089
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:08,560
I mean, I think this could be a really good thing.

1090
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,040
Oh, I don't know.

1091
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:13,520
Hey, why don't we solve Joey's hard drive problem before we get out of here?

1092
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:19,920
He writes and he says, all right, he says, to start, I'm a complete newbie to using Linux.

1093
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:24,040
I'm a 50-year-old systems analyst who has worked in Windows World for a long time.

1094
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:28,160
A year or so ago, I got hooked on the Linux action show, so I decided to try Linux.

1095
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:34,240
I've got a couple of Dell D3 630s, one with KDE and the other partitioned with Maya and

1096
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:35,360
Ubuntu.

1097
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:38,900
So far, my experience has been absolutely positive, and I kick myself for not trying

1098
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:40,600
Linux sooner.

1099
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:44,720
So I have a ton of questions, but the most pressing is regarding an issue I ran into

1100
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,920
a couple of months ago while updating Ubuntu.

1101
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:53,400
I mentioned earlier that I have Ubuntu and a Mint slash Maya on this machine.

1102
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:58,500
During the update, the hard drive crashed, and now I'm getting bad sector messages when

1103
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,320
I try to boot up Ubuntu.

1104
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:04,560
I can still boot up my Mint with no problem, and I'd like to see if any of my data on the

1105
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,880
Ubuntu partition is retrievable.

1106
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:11,600
I realize this is a hardware issue related, it's related to a hardware issue, and it's

1107
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:14,320
not changed my mind about learning about Linux at all.

1108
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:19,760
However, I can't seem to find a way to access the partition from the Mint partition.

1109
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,840
If it's not possible, then so be it.

1110
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:26,040
I sincerely apologize for my lack of knowledge, and if I've used any incorrect terminology.

1111
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,940
I hope that you have not known my lengthy message.

1112
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:30,320
Your assistance and advice is most appreciated."

1113
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:37,240
So, boy, I read that last paragraph and I get a little worried.

1114
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:42,160
Yeah, I mean, first and foremost, I mean, when in doubt, do hard drive, obviously.

1115
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:46,080
I guess outside of that, maybe a file system check of some, you know, I mean, I don't know.

1116
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:47,080
Yeah, Riley's got us.

1117
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:48,080
Riley, what do you think?

1118
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,200
I think you're going to recommend one of my favorite tools, aren't you?

1119
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,200
Yes, System Rescue CD.

1120
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:55,680
You actually have a lot of tools where you can check and clean your hard drive out.

1121
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:56,680
There you go.

1122
00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:01,880
You should be seeing the hard drive and partitions from his Mint installation, and that makes

1123
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:04,320
me think that it's really, real bad.

1124
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:05,320
It's real bad.

1125
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:09,640
Yeah, if it's that, then there's not much you can do, unfortunately, but it's just a

1126
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:12,800
couple bad sectors, and System Rescue can help with that.

1127
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:13,800
Yeah.

1128
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:14,800
Yeah, for sure.

1129
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:20,720
It sounds to me like he may have lost his root file system, what have you, on the hard

1130
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:21,720
drive.

1131
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:22,720
You know how it's set up.

1132
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:23,720
Yeah.

1133
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,280
So, it's beyond file system check at that point.

1134
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,280
It sounds bad.

1135
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:30,480
So, what he needs to do is, he needs to get a list of the drives attached and their partitions,

1136
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,520
and the other thing he could try doing is he could try installing, I would recommend,

1137
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:38,360
we did an episode on this, it doesn't quite show in the window, but it's called DD Rescue,

1138
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:42,960
and we did an episode of Linux Action Show on this a while back, so you can find that

1139
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:48,680
if you dig around, but DD Rescue, it's a data recovery tool, and what's great about DD Rescue

1140
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:51,620
is that it will perform like a soldier.

1141
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:57,120
It will read and read and read and read that bad sector for as long as it possibly can,

1142
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:00,580
every single block, man, and it will read and read and read it, and the way it does

1143
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:03,920
it is it will take a pass at your hard drive, and it will get everything it got on that

1144
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:07,320
first pass, and then it will go back and get the next pass, and then the next pass, and

1145
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:10,160
the next pass, and it will keep going and keep going and keep going for as long as you

1146
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,160
really want it to.

1147
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:14,440
I mean, it will go for a really long time, and it can spit that out to an image file

1148
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:18,960
that you can then look at later on, so that might be something you want to look into,

1149
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:22,480
and there you go, the random person in the chat room just linked the video, I'll put

1150
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:26,600
a link to that in the chat room, or I mean, I'm sorry, in the show notes, yeah.

1151
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:30,480
One suggestion I have, and it might sound a little bit extreme, but it's worked for

1152
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:38,660
me is when I had a 500 gig drive that wasn't readable at all in BIOS or in the system,

1153
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:44,960
so I threw some Googling on, and I ended up putting in a Ziploc bag and putting it in

1154
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:52,240
the freezer for a couple of days, and then it actually read it for a limited time before

1155
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:57,720
it heated up to normal operating temperature, so I could at least pull some files I needed

1156
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:58,720
off.

1157
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,720
It's not 100% full-proof, though.

1158
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:05,680
That sounds like a last-ditch effort, yeah, that should be a last-ditch effort, if ever.

1159
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:10,040
Yeah, that was pretty much my last-ditch effort, since it was a power search that happened

1160
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:11,040
on my drive.

1161
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:12,480
So, hold on, I'm going to play this clip.

1162
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:16,920
Let me see here, you're seeing timeout errors on SDA, whatever, you're getting error messages

1163
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:17,920
on there.

1164
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:18,920
There's some red flags that are being thrown up at you.

1165
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:21,640
Maybe, like, when you mount the drive, your system kind of locks up for a little bit.

1166
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:25,360
These are all indications that drive is going out, you need to get the data off there real

1167
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:26,360
quick.

1168
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,840
That's where an open source program called DD Rescue comes in.

1169
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:33,400
Now, here's what's great about DD Rescue, you're familiar with DD, I would assume, right?

1170
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:39,240
DD Rescue is DD for data recovery, and I'll link to a walkthrough video, you guys can

1171
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:44,920
see how this process works when you're recovering data on a drive, but think of DD Rescue as

1172
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:46,620
like this.

1173
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:50,840
You start it on a drive, and you can assign it some thresholds and some variables, and

1174
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:55,320
what DD Rescue's essential mission is, is it tries to rip through that drive from one

1175
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:59,740
end to the other end as fast as possible, and as it goes, every time it hits a bad sector,

1176
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:03,080
it marks it along the way, and then it just keeps going, and it writes all this to a raw

1177
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,080
image file.

1178
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,780
You need to store that raw image file on a different drive, I have the syntax for this

1179
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:11,760
in the show notes, and then, as it finds these errors, once it gets to the end of the drive,

1180
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:15,880
it then loops back, and depending on how many times you've told it in the command line flag,

1181
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:19,800
it then once again tries to get those bad sectors, and it'll try, so say you set it

1182
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:23,240
for three times, it'll try, it'll go through, it'll go through all of them again, and it's

1183
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:24,240
...

1184
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,240
I used to play old clips of us all the time.

1185
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:27,120
I mean, that was exactly what I just said.

1186
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:31,720
So that was a Linux action show season 27, episode 10, if you want to check that out.

1187
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:33,960
Sorry, Mom, if you couldn't hear that, I was playing it on your channel, but Joey, good

1188
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:38,240
luck with that, and so check out that episode, we'll have it linked in the show notes.

1189
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:41,400
We've got a couple other tools in there, and I think I totally agree with Riley, too.

1190
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:45,320
The System Rescue CD has got to be one of the greatest little pieces of... I always

1191
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:46,600
have a copy in my bag.

1192
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:49,360
Whenever I was going to a client, always had a copy of it.

1193
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,360
So very cool.

1194
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:51,360
Good stuff.

1195
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:55,240
All right, well, I want to say thank you to Michael for coming on Linux Unplugged today.

1196
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:57,520
It was great having you here.

1197
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:58,520
And thanks for having me.

1198
01:03:58,520 --> 01:03:59,520
Yeah, thanks.

1199
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:00,520
That was awesome.

1200
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,520
Yeah, thank you very much, and you are welcome to come back and join our Mumber Room anytime.

1201
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:05,760
We always have it open during Linux Unplugged, so if there's anything on your mind you ever

1202
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,320
want to share, we'll give you a little slot.

1203
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:10,720
You come on the show, we'd be happy to have you, and also, we'd love to have you join

1204
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:11,720
us live.

1205
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:12,720
Why don't you come over live?

1206
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:13,860

slash calendar, and guess what?

1209
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,240
I really would love to hear your feedback.

1210
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:26,840
You might have noticed this, but Matt and I, we start every single episode of Linux

1211
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:28,440
Unplugged with your feedback.

1212
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:29,600
That means we need your feedback.

1213
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:30,600
That's how it works.

1214
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:31,600
It's the math of it.

1215
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:35,480
So go over to JupiterBroadcasting.com and click that contact link and send something

1216
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:36,480
in to us.

1217
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:37,480
We'd love to hear it.

1218
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:38,480
Now, Matt?

1219
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:39,480
Yes?

1220
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:40,480
We have a surprise.

1221
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,560
We are scheduled to talk with some of the folks from the Numix project.

1222
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:49,740
They are setting out to make the GNOME desktop even more beautiful with a complete theming

1223
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:52,800
package that I've been using for a couple of weeks.

1224
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:53,880
It's really elegant.

1225
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:57,780
It's really amazing, and I want to talk to them about making the Linux desktop look better

1226
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:00,640
and make it look even just more incredible, and that's what they're working on.

1227
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:01,960
So they'll be joining us on Sunday.

1228
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:02,960
Right on.

1229
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:06,600
But, you know, that doesn't mean we're not going to have a great show next.

1230
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:09,360
Linux Unplugged, we've got a great show planned for that, too, so don't worry, everybody.

1231
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:10,360
All right, Matt, have a great week.

1232
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:11,360
I'll see you on Sunday, okay?

1233
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:12,360
All right.

1234
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:13,360
See you, son.

1235
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:14,360
All right, everyone.

1236
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:15,360
Thank you so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1237
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:30,760
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.
