WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.680
Ladies and gentlemen, arriving in the studio

00:02.680 --> 00:06.960
is our brand new PinePhone Braveheart Edition.

00:06.960 --> 00:09.320
Mr. Westpane, would you care to do the unboxing, sir?

00:09.320 --> 00:10.120
Ooh, I love this.

00:10.120 --> 00:12.760
I mean, even on the side, model, PinePhone,

00:12.760 --> 00:15.120
Linux smartphone, how cool is that?

00:15.120 --> 00:16.440
That's exactly what I want.

00:16.440 --> 00:18.040
I know, it is so cool.

00:18.040 --> 00:19.840
Now, truth be told, I've already taken it out of the box

00:19.840 --> 00:21.280
once and played around with it a little bit,

00:21.280 --> 00:23.120
but it's bigger than you'd expect, isn't it?

00:23.120 --> 00:25.040
It is, but it's shiny.

00:25.040 --> 00:27.080
I mean, it looks like a phone.

00:27.080 --> 00:30.560
Yeah, it looks like a legit phone,

00:30.560 --> 00:32.760
and it feels really good in the hand,

00:32.760 --> 00:35.320
a lot better than I was expecting.

00:35.320 --> 00:36.280
How about that?

00:36.280 --> 00:39.000
Wow, nice finish on the back, smooth.

00:39.000 --> 00:39.800
USB-C.

00:39.800 --> 00:42.080
USB-C port right there on the bottom.

00:42.080 --> 00:43.560
You know, it's maybe a little thicker

00:43.560 --> 00:46.560
than some phones I'm used to, but not much.

00:46.560 --> 00:51.480
I mean, I could be way off, but it feels no bigger or thicker

00:51.480 --> 00:53.920
than, say, like the Nexus 6, yes, or whatever it was.

00:53.920 --> 00:55.880
You're absolutely right.

00:55.880 --> 00:57.960
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

00:57.960 --> 00:59.120
It's real.

00:59.120 --> 01:01.720
And when you hold it in the hand,

01:01.720 --> 01:04.000
you have a real appreciation of the feat that

01:04.000 --> 01:05.520
has just been pulled off here.

01:05.520 --> 01:07.480
It even has a headphone port.

01:07.480 --> 01:17.840
Hello, friends, and welcome in to your Unplugged program,

01:17.840 --> 01:19.520
episode 340.

01:19.520 --> 01:20.280
My name is Chris.

01:20.280 --> 01:21.040
My name is Wes.

01:21.040 --> 01:22.480
Hello, Wes.

01:22.480 --> 01:23.480
This is really exciting.

01:23.480 --> 01:26.040
I've been looking forward to episode 340,

01:26.040 --> 01:29.880
and I didn't expect you to bring this entire taco plate.

01:29.880 --> 01:31.280
This is really nice.

01:31.280 --> 01:32.640
You know, I will apologize.

01:32.640 --> 01:35.360
We will be eating some tacos during the show.

01:35.360 --> 01:38.080
You know, it is episode 340, and that's how we're celebrating.

01:38.080 --> 01:39.720
These look so tasty.

01:39.720 --> 01:42.280
But on the show today, we have a lot of community news

01:42.280 --> 01:46.800
to get into, including a brand new community news subsegment,

01:46.800 --> 01:48.920
the first ever on the Unplugged program.

01:48.920 --> 01:50.600
I've been on burnout still.

01:50.600 --> 01:52.560
We've gotten some more feedback.

01:52.560 --> 01:54.200
Our friends from elementary OS are here

01:54.200 --> 01:56.200
to talk about the App Center and the success

01:56.200 --> 01:57.800
of their fundraiser, and then we'll

01:57.800 --> 02:01.560
wrap it up with some highlights from Fosdome 2020.

02:01.560 --> 02:02.320
Pretty nice, Wes.

02:02.320 --> 02:03.400
This is a giant show.

02:03.400 --> 02:04.160
Pretty nice.

02:04.160 --> 02:09.600
And of course, we have a slammed mumble room today.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.560
Time appropriate greetings, virtual lug.

02:11.560 --> 02:12.440
Hello.

02:12.440 --> 02:13.840
Hello.

02:13.840 --> 02:14.880
Hello.

02:14.880 --> 02:15.760
Howdy.

02:15.760 --> 02:16.280
Hey.

02:16.280 --> 02:17.320
This is a record breaker.

02:17.320 --> 02:18.840
That is definitely a record breaker.

02:18.840 --> 02:19.960
This is so awesome.

02:19.960 --> 02:21.280
Hello, everybody.

02:21.280 --> 02:25.920
Ace, Nomad, Brent, Byte, Carl, Cassidy, Dan, Drifter, Dusty,

02:25.920 --> 02:31.960
Frank, John, Colonel, MarioGrip2, MiniMech, Nervo, Steve,

02:31.960 --> 02:34.200
and TechMav are just in the main on air.

02:34.200 --> 02:37.080
And then there's a whole other group up in the quiet listening.

02:37.080 --> 02:40.880
But also, a big, warm welcome back to Mr. Bacon.

02:40.880 --> 02:41.440
Hey, Cheesy.

02:41.440 --> 02:42.120
How you doing?

02:42.120 --> 02:43.200
Hey, everybody.

02:43.200 --> 02:44.040
I'm doing good, man.

02:44.040 --> 02:45.240
Glad to be back.

02:45.240 --> 02:46.160
We missed you.

02:46.160 --> 02:47.360
Good to have you back.

02:47.360 --> 02:49.480
Glad you're up and at least going enough

02:49.480 --> 02:51.720
to join us on the show today because there's

02:51.720 --> 02:53.720
a ton for us to get into.

02:53.720 --> 02:56.720
And one of them is installed right here on my machine

02:56.720 --> 02:57.960
right now, Wes.

02:57.960 --> 03:02.560
Plasma 5.18 is out.

03:02.560 --> 03:03.640
It's a doozy.

03:03.640 --> 03:08.280
It's an LTS, which, of course, stands for Long Term Support.

03:08.280 --> 03:11.440
Yeah, that means 5.18 will be updated and maintained

03:11.440 --> 03:14.560
by the KDE contributors for the next two years.

03:14.560 --> 03:16.480
Regular versions are just four months.

03:16.480 --> 03:17.440
Boom.

03:17.440 --> 03:20.600
So this is an overall continuing improvement to the look.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.600
Better support for GTK applications

03:22.600 --> 03:25.240
using client-side decorations.

03:25.240 --> 03:29.080
And as well, I mean, I guess if you're coming,

03:29.080 --> 03:32.120
thinking about this, if you're coming from the past LTS

03:32.120 --> 03:35.960
release of Plasma, which was 5.12, which shipped in Kubuntu,

03:35.960 --> 03:38.440
you have a totally new notification system,

03:38.440 --> 03:41.280
all new web browser integration, new lock screen,

03:41.280 --> 03:43.720
totally redesigned system settings panel,

03:43.720 --> 03:47.200
totally new display management, including

03:47.200 --> 03:49.400
what's it called, fractional scaling support in there,

03:49.400 --> 03:51.720
flap hack support in Discover, night color features,

03:51.720 --> 03:53.400
Thunderbolt device support.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.800
It's a huge, huge, huge upgrade if you're

03:55.800 --> 03:58.240
coming from the past LTS.

03:58.240 --> 03:59.820
Still pretty good if you're coming just

03:59.820 --> 04:00.920
from the previous release, though.

04:00.920 --> 04:02.320
There's some nice things in there.

04:02.320 --> 04:03.280
Oh, yes.

04:03.280 --> 04:05.160
OK, so you mentioned fractional scaling.

04:05.160 --> 04:08.200
That's now a lot less glitchy on X11.

04:08.200 --> 04:08.960
Glitchy, you say.

04:08.960 --> 04:09.600
Oh, yeah.

04:09.600 --> 04:10.160
Less glitchy.

04:10.160 --> 04:10.880
You don't want that.

04:10.880 --> 04:11.440
I don't want glitches.

04:11.440 --> 04:13.220
I mean, I'm not promising it's glitch-free,

04:13.220 --> 04:15.360
but significantly less glitchy, let's say.

04:15.360 --> 04:18.800
Hey, Wes, what's a glitch?

04:18.800 --> 04:20.440
Oh, you've never encountered that.

04:20.440 --> 04:21.280
I mean, what is it?

04:21.280 --> 04:23.120
Like, technically, what is a glitch?

04:23.120 --> 04:24.120
What is a glitch?

04:24.120 --> 04:24.960
I don't know what a glitch is.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.480
Are they talking about bugs?

04:26.480 --> 04:27.600
Do they mean it's less buggy?

04:27.600 --> 04:29.080
Is that what they mean?

04:29.080 --> 04:30.040
What does a glitch mean?

04:30.040 --> 04:33.680
A sudden, usually temporary malfunction or irregularity

04:33.680 --> 04:34.400
of equipment.

04:34.400 --> 04:35.080
Oh, a bug.

04:35.080 --> 04:36.320
OK, OK, good, less bugs.

04:36.320 --> 04:36.840
That's good.

04:36.840 --> 04:37.560
Less bugs.

04:37.560 --> 04:38.200
That's good.

04:38.200 --> 04:41.280
Fewer bugs, probably is what Joe wants you to say.

04:41.280 --> 04:42.000
Fewer bugs.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.880
If you have an NVIDIA GPU, that info is now in case discard.

04:45.880 --> 04:47.320
Hey, that's pretty handy.

04:47.320 --> 04:52.240
And my favorite, a redesigned audio volume system widget.

04:52.240 --> 04:53.240
I love that.

04:53.240 --> 04:56.680
And Joey over at OMG Ubuntu has a really nice write-up

04:56.680 --> 04:58.240
that I think is a little bit better

04:58.240 --> 04:59.760
than the official write-up.

04:59.760 --> 05:00.680
But that's not bad.

05:00.680 --> 05:02.360
It's just Joey really did a great job of summarizing it.

05:02.360 --> 05:04.000
So we'll link to that.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.360
There's just another bit of hardware news to get into,

05:06.360 --> 05:09.680
and that is this monster of a Thaleo desktop

05:09.680 --> 05:11.760
that System76 launched.

05:11.760 --> 05:13.400
It's a whole new line that's powered

05:13.400 --> 05:17.920
by these brand new Ryzen Threadripper CPUs.

05:17.920 --> 05:19.800
Yeah, so it's actually launched in conjunction

05:19.800 --> 05:25.160
with these new Ryzen Threadripper 3990X.

05:25.160 --> 05:27.840
And with that, we have the Thaleo Major R2,

05:27.840 --> 05:29.760
which has those Threadripper CPU options.

05:29.760 --> 05:32.080
And wow, there's a lot in here.

05:32.080 --> 05:35.840
Yeah, so the base configuration starts 16 gigs of RAM,

05:35.840 --> 05:39.000
250 gigabyte NVMe.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.560
I said that right this time, right?

05:40.560 --> 05:40.840
Didn't I?

05:40.840 --> 05:41.320
Yes.

05:41.320 --> 05:45.560
It's a graphics 550 and a 1,000-watt power supply.

05:45.560 --> 05:47.160
But you can get the thing pretty loaded.

05:47.160 --> 05:50.240
Yeah, I think these specs might be more suitable to you, Chris.

05:50.240 --> 05:54.400
64-core Threadripper, 256 gigs of DDR4 RAM,

05:54.400 --> 05:57.360
and 46 terabytes of storage.

05:57.360 --> 05:58.040
I'm sorry, what?

05:58.040 --> 06:01.200
Yeah, that's three NVMe SSDs and eight SATA drives.

06:01.200 --> 06:04.840
I'm sorry, did you say how many terabytes of storage?

06:04.840 --> 06:06.480
46.

06:06.480 --> 06:07.480
OK.

06:07.480 --> 06:09.000
On the graphics side, you can also

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
have dual NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 TIs.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.640
I'm going to go configure one right now.

06:14.640 --> 06:18.720
So I'll get a 64-core Threadripper system possibly.

06:18.720 --> 06:21.480
Let's see, I'll start with, realistically,

06:21.480 --> 06:23.160
I don't need 64 cores.

06:23.160 --> 06:24.040
I'd probably be happy.

06:24.040 --> 06:25.480
I could probably live with 24 cores.

06:25.480 --> 06:26.320
Plenty of cores.

06:26.320 --> 06:27.360
Probably.

06:27.360 --> 06:29.360
I would like 32 gigs of RAM, but I actually

06:29.360 --> 06:31.000
don't know if I need much more than that.

06:31.000 --> 06:31.880
But think about that.

06:31.880 --> 06:33.920
You're going to have the system for a long time.

06:33.920 --> 06:36.840
I agree, but I have been surprised at the systems that

06:36.840 --> 06:37.880
have 16 gigs of RAM.

06:37.880 --> 06:39.120
I'm still getting work done.

06:39.120 --> 06:43.000
It's a little tight, and the ones that have 32 and 64

06:43.000 --> 06:44.240
feel about the same to me.

06:44.240 --> 06:45.800
You're so reasonable.

06:45.800 --> 06:49.280
But that 250-gig NVMe has to go.

06:49.280 --> 06:50.600
Yeah, think of all the things you're

06:50.600 --> 06:52.360
going to be doing on a system like this.

06:52.360 --> 06:54.320
That's going to be a lot of large files.

06:54.320 --> 06:56.040
Two terabytes on that sucker.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.880
You can get an additional one.

06:57.880 --> 06:58.520
I think I won't.

06:58.520 --> 07:00.960
I think instead I'll do 2.5 storage,

07:00.960 --> 07:04.800
and I'll go with a two-terabyte SSD for that one.

07:04.800 --> 07:09.480
Oh, they offer just spinning rust, too.

07:09.480 --> 07:10.480
All right, I'll do that.

07:10.480 --> 07:13.560
I'll do a 500-gigabyte solid-state spinning rust.

07:13.560 --> 07:16.600
I'm going to go pretty realistic on the old GPU.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.320
I just love how the form is set up,

07:18.320 --> 07:21.240
because the header is first GPU.

07:21.240 --> 07:22.320
Yeah, that's true, right?

07:22.320 --> 07:23.640
I'm going to go reasonable here.

07:23.640 --> 07:25.720
I don't think I have to go crazy with the GPU.

07:25.720 --> 07:27.680
I don't need a whole bunch of GPUs,

07:27.680 --> 07:29.920
but I want this thing to play a decent amount of games.

07:29.920 --> 07:32.360
So I'm going to go an RX 5700.

07:32.360 --> 07:35.240
It's not the best I could do, but it'll work.

07:35.240 --> 07:36.360
I don't need a second GPU.

07:36.360 --> 07:37.960
I'm not going to get a display.

07:37.960 --> 07:40.920
I'll stick to the base warranty to try to keep costs down.

07:40.920 --> 07:44.200
And Westpac, can you read that final price there?

07:44.200 --> 07:44.760
No, I can't.

07:44.760 --> 07:48.520
Oh, yeah, $4,870.

07:48.520 --> 07:53.120
That is a lot less than I was expecting.

07:53.120 --> 07:55.360
It's not to say that it's not a lot of money,

07:55.360 --> 07:59.080
but I think the Mac Pro just totally reset my expectations.

07:59.080 --> 08:01.560
This thing would be no slouch.

08:01.560 --> 08:05.800
I mean, I only got the 24-core version and 2 terabytes

08:05.800 --> 08:06.440
of storage.

08:06.440 --> 08:08.600
And I mean, dang, man.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.760
And I mean, that's before you get to the whole,

08:10.760 --> 08:13.040
it's made right here in the States,

08:13.040 --> 08:15.320
and it's all kinds of open.

08:15.320 --> 08:18.000
Oh, yeah, I'm not even making a comparison in that regard.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.720
I'm just saying I think they're getting the pricing right,

08:20.720 --> 08:22.640
and it's a really nice system for what you get.

08:22.640 --> 08:25.000
And it looks like they've updated the cooling system

08:25.000 --> 08:27.480
in there a little bit since the original Thalios that we saw.

08:27.480 --> 08:30.040
Yes, and I mean, yeah, that's a totally reasonable amount,

08:30.040 --> 08:32.520
especially for a business buying this for an employee.

08:32.520 --> 08:35.960
Yeah, or me buying it for myself.

08:35.960 --> 08:36.800
No, that's not true.

08:36.800 --> 08:38.280
I just don't need that much power.

08:38.280 --> 08:39.280
I don't need it.

08:39.280 --> 08:41.160
Not yet.

08:41.160 --> 08:45.160
Well, it looks like they did change the CPU intake

08:45.160 --> 08:51.000
to include another die-cut kind of almost a Linux unplugged

08:51.000 --> 08:52.640
rocket along the side of it.

08:52.640 --> 08:53.160
That's cool.

08:53.160 --> 08:55.160
And underneath it there, it looks

08:55.160 --> 08:56.560
like some additional Morse code.

08:56.560 --> 09:00.120
I don't know what it says, but they

09:00.120 --> 09:02.720
are pretty cool about hiding little Easter eggs all

09:02.720 --> 09:04.600
throughout their cases and stuff, too.

09:04.600 --> 09:07.720
It probably says linuxunplug.com slash RSS.

09:07.720 --> 09:08.600
Probably does.

09:08.600 --> 09:10.040
It should.

09:10.040 --> 09:12.400
All right, I promised it earlier,

09:12.400 --> 09:14.840
we have a new subsegment here in the community news.

09:14.840 --> 09:18.800
Ladies and gentlemen, I am proud to announce

09:18.800 --> 09:20.760
the launch of Rustwatch.

09:20.760 --> 09:32.960
I think that the sound clips guy you hired

09:32.960 --> 09:34.560
is taking this job a little too seriously.

09:34.560 --> 09:35.560
That was a little much.

09:35.560 --> 09:36.560
Got to have him dial it down a little bit.

09:36.560 --> 09:38.040
Well, it's the first time for this segment,

09:38.040 --> 09:41.200
and you've been begging to add this to the show for weeks.

09:41.200 --> 09:42.200
That was a lot, though.

09:42.200 --> 09:43.240
That's a hell of an intro.

09:43.240 --> 09:43.880
I know.

09:43.880 --> 09:45.440
It's sort of too much.

09:45.440 --> 09:50.240
Well, anyways, Rustwatch starts out with a fork of core boot.

09:50.240 --> 09:53.880
This is going to be the pitch for Rustwatch.

09:53.880 --> 09:56.960
What is getting rewritten in Rust this time around?

09:56.960 --> 09:59.800
And this time, it's core boot, and the project

09:59.800 --> 10:00.840
is called OrBoot.

10:03.880 --> 10:04.600
You get it?

10:04.600 --> 10:06.240
I love that name, personally.

10:06.240 --> 10:10.920
And it currently plans to support Linux boot payloads.

10:10.920 --> 10:13.680
Wes, why are we doing this?

10:13.680 --> 10:15.560
You've got to rewrite everything in Rust, right?

10:15.560 --> 10:16.880
There is some logic to it.

10:16.880 --> 10:18.480
The whole point about Rustwatch is

10:18.480 --> 10:22.400
to have some fun with the fact that it's like the new hotness,

10:22.400 --> 10:23.720
but there is reason for it.

10:23.720 --> 10:26.720
It is a safer language for maybe things like this.

10:26.720 --> 10:29.120
And there's lots of the nice modern tool chain

10:29.120 --> 10:30.680
that you have access to.

10:30.680 --> 10:32.520
And in some cases, doing things again,

10:32.520 --> 10:34.000
well, they can end up better designed,

10:34.000 --> 10:35.320
learning from the past mistakes.

10:35.320 --> 10:36.120
Sure, sure.

10:36.120 --> 10:40.640
But it's not all roses here in the Rustwatch subsegment.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.960
There's also some concerns about Rust infringing

10:43.960 --> 10:46.120
on people's freedoms.

10:46.120 --> 10:48.040
Of course, we have the four essential freedoms

10:48.040 --> 10:52.280
and freedom number three is being imposed upon.

10:52.280 --> 10:54.960
Here is the post from the hyper wiki they have.

10:54.960 --> 10:57.720
Rust and also Cargo, the Rust package manager,

10:57.720 --> 11:00.720
violates freedom to redistribute without their explicit

11:00.720 --> 11:01.480
approval.

11:01.480 --> 11:04.300
Their trademark license imposes requirements

11:04.300 --> 11:06.400
for distributions of modified versions

11:06.400 --> 11:10.720
that make it inconvenient to exercise freedom three.

11:10.720 --> 11:14.400
And this has turned into a bit of a conversation that

11:14.400 --> 11:17.200
has kind of taken a turn of, well,

11:17.200 --> 11:20.440
the problem is distros can just take up our packages,

11:20.440 --> 11:22.520
modify them, and call them the same thing.

11:22.520 --> 11:26.160
And now this is the argument.

11:26.160 --> 11:28.040
The distros want to be able to package it up

11:28.040 --> 11:28.680
and call it Rust.

11:28.680 --> 11:30.840
They don't want them to call it Rust without their approval

11:30.840 --> 11:32.480
because they want to make sure it truly

11:32.480 --> 11:33.760
is genuine their product.

11:33.760 --> 11:34.800
Right.

11:34.800 --> 11:36.600
An example might be if you were to strip out

11:36.600 --> 11:38.400
the borrow checker, for example, which

11:38.400 --> 11:41.360
is part of the important memory model used in Rust

11:41.360 --> 11:42.600
to keep things safe.

11:42.600 --> 11:45.280
And if you called that Rust, that

11:45.280 --> 11:47.500
wouldn't really be Rust.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.080
It's an interesting question because it

11:49.080 --> 11:52.000
is sort of it's not necessarily violating those freedoms.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.880
It's still entirely open source.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.760
It's a trademark issue, kind of if you

11:55.760 --> 11:58.680
remember the whole Ice Weasel Firefox business.

11:58.680 --> 12:00.000
It's definitely similar to that.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.120
But of course, the code is all still open source.

12:04.120 --> 12:06.520
Steve Klabnik, who's a Rust developer,

12:06.520 --> 12:10.320
did respond over at Hacker News and said, basically, yes,

12:10.320 --> 12:12.400
the intention of the policy is to prevent people

12:12.400 --> 12:16.480
from adding confusion around a fork of the language.

12:16.480 --> 12:17.840
But we do know that distributions

12:17.840 --> 12:19.760
make patches to Rust and still call it Rust.

12:19.760 --> 12:21.560
And we're fine with that.

12:21.560 --> 12:22.600
Nobody's asked to do it.

12:22.600 --> 12:27.000
And we haven't instigated any problems with that.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.680
So I think it is kind of a gray area.

12:28.680 --> 12:31.080
It's not maybe as free as we would like to see.

12:31.080 --> 12:32.680
But there are trade-offs to be made.

12:32.680 --> 12:34.120
And I think the Rust team has done

12:34.120 --> 12:35.560
a good job of managing their project

12:35.560 --> 12:38.160
and has gained a lot of contributions,

12:38.160 --> 12:40.400
even made a whole subsegment on this show for it.

12:40.400 --> 12:43.640
So I don't know that it's the end of the world just yet.

12:43.640 --> 12:44.520
Yeah.

12:44.520 --> 12:46.040
Yeah, it seems like they'll work it out.

12:46.040 --> 12:47.480
But it was interesting to see people go

12:47.480 --> 12:49.800
to their edges of the mat and say, well, distributions

12:49.800 --> 12:50.480
do this.

12:50.480 --> 12:53.080
And then other people say, well, the four essential freedoms

12:53.080 --> 12:54.720
guarantee us this.

12:54.720 --> 12:56.760
But we'll sort it out and do it, of course.

12:56.760 --> 13:00.040
And in the meantime, we'll keep an eye as part of Rust Watch.

13:00.040 --> 13:11.160
Where did you find this guy?

13:11.160 --> 13:12.040
Yeah, he's real cheesy.

13:12.040 --> 13:14.920
If you hadn't brought the tacos, I don't know, Wes.

13:14.920 --> 13:15.920
I just don't know.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.400
Tacos smooth all wounds.

13:17.400 --> 13:21.280
Well, something pretty neat happened this last week.

13:21.280 --> 13:23.760
It really happened over the weekend.

13:23.760 --> 13:27.200
The folks over at Elementary OS launched App Center

13:27.200 --> 13:29.640
for Everyone on IndieGoGo, a fundraiser

13:29.640 --> 13:31.320
to get the team together in Denver

13:31.320 --> 13:33.560
to work essentially on a sprint.

13:33.560 --> 13:36.160
And their goal was $10,000.

13:36.160 --> 13:38.520
That was probably too low.

13:38.520 --> 13:42.160
Because as we record this, they have reached 110%

13:42.160 --> 13:42.880
of their funding.

13:42.880 --> 13:44.600
They're now at $11,000.

13:44.600 --> 13:45.280
Wow.

13:45.280 --> 13:46.760
Congratulations, Dan and Cassidy.

13:46.760 --> 13:47.240
Thanks.

13:47.240 --> 13:47.960
Thank you.

13:47.960 --> 13:52.440
So this is obviously a signal that your user base

13:52.440 --> 13:56.440
gets what you're doing and encourages you to keep going.

13:56.440 --> 13:58.680
Did you shoot a little too low, possibly?

13:58.680 --> 14:01.400
Well, I think what we wanted to set up

14:01.400 --> 14:04.320
is what the cost of the sprint was.

14:04.320 --> 14:06.040
And we budgeted out pretty carefully

14:06.040 --> 14:09.760
of what is actually it going to cost us to build this thing.

14:09.760 --> 14:12.320
But yeah, I guess it might have been

14:12.320 --> 14:17.360
that we could have shot for two weeks or two separate sprints.

14:17.360 --> 14:21.240
We're talking now about how we could handle some stretch

14:21.240 --> 14:22.120
goals.

14:22.120 --> 14:26.640
And the kind of ideas are either following up

14:26.640 --> 14:29.720
with another sprint, maybe that or something,

14:29.720 --> 14:33.360
or as we originally planned with the campaign,

14:33.360 --> 14:37.320
to use any extra funds to do remote contracted work.

14:37.320 --> 14:38.200
Sure.

14:38.200 --> 14:41.320
So Cassidy, I've noticed that you've been hustling like crazy,

14:41.320 --> 14:43.160
trying to reach out to everybody who's

14:43.160 --> 14:46.840
kicked in, contacting people to spread the word.

14:46.840 --> 14:49.720
Has this been a full-time job for you for the last few days?

14:49.720 --> 14:50.880
Kind of, yeah.

14:50.880 --> 14:51.720
It's been a lot.

14:51.720 --> 14:52.760
But it's been really fun.

14:52.760 --> 14:56.360
I mean, Dan did most of the campaign setup

14:56.360 --> 14:59.960
or a lot of the campaign setup work, recorded a video.

14:59.960 --> 15:01.520
I helped edit that a little bit.

15:01.520 --> 15:03.140
And we've been sending out the updates.

15:03.140 --> 15:05.520
But we've heard from backers that they

15:05.520 --> 15:08.360
like getting updates from the project,

15:08.360 --> 15:09.600
even if they've already backed.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.900
Like, we're not begging them for more money or anything.

15:11.900 --> 15:14.280
But they like hearing, like, yeah, hey,

15:14.280 --> 15:15.320
we hit this percentage.

15:15.320 --> 15:16.880
We hit this number of backers.

15:16.880 --> 15:18.520
Oh, hey, here's an update on the swag.

15:18.520 --> 15:20.560
So I've been trying to be really transparent with that.

15:20.560 --> 15:21.720
That's been really great.

15:21.720 --> 15:25.440
So let's explain, before we go too far, what it

15:25.440 --> 15:27.240
is that the goal is here, Dan.

15:27.240 --> 15:29.760
It's App Center for Everyone.

15:29.760 --> 15:31.200
What does that really mean?

15:31.200 --> 15:34.760
The end result is a sprint that will hopefully produce what?

15:34.760 --> 15:39.040
The idea is that when we first did App Center,

15:39.040 --> 15:41.480
we did our fundraiser a couple of years ago.

15:41.480 --> 15:46.040
And it was the pay-what-you-want app store for elementary OS.

15:46.040 --> 15:49.520
As we've been working on it, technologies like Flatpak

15:49.520 --> 15:50.660
have kind of evolved.

15:50.660 --> 15:54.760
And we see developers that are looking at that

15:54.760 --> 15:58.240
and saying, hey, I would really like to reach more users

15:58.240 --> 16:00.800
than just elementary OS users.

16:00.800 --> 16:03.940
But when I publish on Flat Hub, I

16:03.940 --> 16:05.800
lose all the cool pay-what-you-want stuff

16:05.800 --> 16:07.520
that comes with App Center.

16:07.520 --> 16:09.720
We want to embrace Flatpak and make

16:09.720 --> 16:13.360
that the standard in App Center so the developer will publish

16:13.360 --> 16:16.480
in App Center, still use our pay-what-you-want model,

16:16.480 --> 16:19.400
but also get a little bit of that wider spread

16:19.400 --> 16:20.600
from Flatpak.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.500
And there's a lot of cool privacy.

16:22.500 --> 16:25.480
It's security implications and stability

16:25.480 --> 16:30.680
and all kinds of stuff for users on that side of using Flatpak.

16:30.680 --> 16:34.800
So that's kind of the big idea is we're taking everything

16:34.800 --> 16:36.640
and rebuilding it from the ground up

16:36.640 --> 16:40.200
around modern technology and all the cool stuff that

16:40.200 --> 16:41.120
comes with it.

16:41.120 --> 16:43.800
As if you were going to build it today, essentially.

16:43.800 --> 16:45.760
How much is this related to some of the work

16:45.760 --> 16:47.920
that Endless has been doing to create ways

16:47.920 --> 16:49.400
to pay for Flatpaks?

16:49.400 --> 16:51.840
So this is actually hand-in-hand with that work.

16:51.840 --> 16:53.480
We've been in discussion with folks

16:53.480 --> 16:57.560
at Endless and FlatHub and Flatpak itself.

16:57.560 --> 17:00.240
And they've been really good about getting feedback

17:00.240 --> 17:03.080
from elementary because they know,

17:03.080 --> 17:05.320
we have a successful pay-what-you-want app store,

17:05.320 --> 17:07.440
and they want to build that capability into Flatpak

17:07.440 --> 17:08.560
itself.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.080
So the new Flatpak Authenticators

17:10.080 --> 17:12.200
is a technology that's enabling that,

17:12.200 --> 17:14.640
and it's looking really good.

17:14.640 --> 17:18.840
And so the end product would be a technology, a set of APIs

17:18.840 --> 17:21.760
or a set of libraries or what, that developers

17:21.760 --> 17:23.440
that are targeting any distribution

17:23.440 --> 17:27.240
could use to enable payments for the Flatpak on, say, Fedora,

17:27.240 --> 17:28.000
for example.

17:28.000 --> 17:28.760
Correct?

17:28.760 --> 17:31.960
The Flatpak Authenticator is part of,

17:31.960 --> 17:34.300
it's associated with the Flatpak remote.

17:34.300 --> 17:35.680
So we'd have an app center remote,

17:35.680 --> 17:38.880
just like you have a FlatHub remote today.

17:38.880 --> 17:40.960
And then when you add that remote to your system,

17:40.960 --> 17:42.800
it automatically downloads the Authenticator

17:42.800 --> 17:44.640
that goes along with that remote.

17:44.640 --> 17:47.560
So then when you go to install a Flatpak from that remote,

17:47.560 --> 17:49.680
it's up to the Authenticator, which is some sort of,

17:49.680 --> 17:51.400
it can be like a website, or in our case,

17:51.400 --> 17:53.200
it's a native GTK app.

17:53.200 --> 17:56.780
So that'll come up and offer the pay what you want download.

17:56.780 --> 17:58.440
So basically, if you target app center

17:58.440 --> 18:00.600
and you put your app in the app center repo,

18:00.600 --> 18:03.680
then you get those pay what you want payments on any Flatpak

18:03.680 --> 18:04.600
platform.

18:04.600 --> 18:05.360
I see.

18:05.360 --> 18:09.680
So we're not necessarily talking about the app center software,

18:09.680 --> 18:13.160
the store itself, coming to all distributions as a Flatpak,

18:13.160 --> 18:19.320
but more of the availability to use this new functionality.

18:19.320 --> 18:21.980
Yeah, that's the beauty of it is that you get to still use

18:21.980 --> 18:25.440
GNOME software or KDD Discover or whatever

18:25.440 --> 18:29.220
it is that you use to consume Flatpaks on your system,

18:29.220 --> 18:30.960
even if it's like the command line,

18:30.960 --> 18:32.520
it still throws the Authenticator

18:32.520 --> 18:34.280
when you go to download.

18:34.280 --> 18:37.520
So you can still use whatever your native system is

18:37.520 --> 18:38.200
that you like.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.240
You don't have to use the app center app,

18:40.240 --> 18:42.520
but you still get to enjoy those apps,

18:42.520 --> 18:45.120
and developers still have a way to monetize.

18:45.120 --> 18:48.720
And we're building the back end in such a way

18:48.720 --> 18:51.400
that it should be agnostic, and it

18:51.400 --> 18:54.440
should be easy to stand up your own instance of it

18:54.440 --> 18:58.400
so that FlatHub can take advantage of this as well.

18:58.400 --> 19:03.200
And we want to really like where anybody can spin up

19:03.200 --> 19:05.880
an app center or FlatHub instance,

19:05.880 --> 19:07.680
their own pay what you want app stores.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.120
Wow, that could be really neat.

19:09.120 --> 19:12.040
So who sits in the middle of refunds?

19:12.040 --> 19:15.660
So say somebody buys something via this process that

19:15.660 --> 19:18.000
isn't an elementary OS app center user

19:18.000 --> 19:19.880
and decides, ah, I don't like this.

19:19.880 --> 19:21.240
I want a refund.

19:21.240 --> 19:24.620
Is your project involved at all in that process,

19:24.620 --> 19:26.200
or is that handled separately?

19:26.200 --> 19:29.040
So the way it's currently set up is that apps are actually

19:29.040 --> 19:33.200
sold by the app authors themselves.

19:33.200 --> 19:35.520
So it's a more direct relationship.

19:35.520 --> 19:37.160
While we are kind of an in-between that

19:37.160 --> 19:40.480
helps distribute those applications,

19:40.480 --> 19:43.680
the application is being sold by the app developer.

19:43.680 --> 19:47.200
So now users will get an email with information

19:47.200 --> 19:47.960
about the purchase.

19:47.960 --> 19:49.680
And then they can, if they want, they

19:49.680 --> 19:51.040
can request a refund that way.

19:51.040 --> 19:53.000
And that'll actually go through the app developer.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.400
Oh, interesting.

19:54.400 --> 19:55.920
Nice and scalable, it sounds like.

19:55.920 --> 19:58.240
So that's, yeah, so then it's just part of the support

19:58.240 --> 20:01.480
process that developer would normally take on anyway,

20:01.480 --> 20:03.320
and doesn't involve the project at all.

20:03.320 --> 20:05.920
I think that was like one of the questions I thought, hmm,

20:05.920 --> 20:07.200
I see people asking this, and I don't

20:07.200 --> 20:08.000
know what the answer is to that.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.080
That seems very elegant and how it already

20:10.080 --> 20:12.080
operates in the app center today.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.840
Exactly, and that's one of the awesome things

20:13.840 --> 20:18.320
that Stripe gives us for free as part of their payments API

20:18.320 --> 20:21.880
is they enable a direct relationship

20:21.880 --> 20:23.880
between the developer and the users.

20:23.880 --> 20:25.680
So it's really convenient.

20:25.680 --> 20:27.920
Cheesy, you had a question as well.

20:27.920 --> 20:30.200
So when you talk about streamlining this payment

20:30.200 --> 20:33.800
process, are you also talking about giving me

20:33.800 --> 20:36.600
the ability to set up an account that I can then

20:36.600 --> 20:39.560
tie to a credit card that will remember

20:39.560 --> 20:43.120
my purchases throughout the app center experience?

20:43.120 --> 20:47.280
That's the big thing that we're looking at is, well, firstly,

20:47.280 --> 20:50.840
we want to have something that's just

20:50.840 --> 20:52.920
you being able to save the payment

20:52.920 --> 20:55.400
and do like a one-click payment.

20:55.400 --> 20:57.560
But the ultimate goal is that we would

20:57.560 --> 21:00.080
like to have some kind of way for you

21:00.080 --> 21:04.320
to log in on another computer and restore

21:04.320 --> 21:05.880
your purchases over there.

21:05.880 --> 21:07.920
And we want to just make sure that we

21:07.920 --> 21:11.320
do that in a way that's secure and privacy respecting,

21:11.320 --> 21:13.720
and we don't want to hold onto a bunch of private data.

21:13.720 --> 21:17.520
So we're kind of working through different models of what

21:17.520 --> 21:20.440
can be stored through Stripe's API,

21:20.440 --> 21:23.680
and we can use tokens and their kind of proven security

21:23.680 --> 21:25.840
infrastructure, and what works better

21:25.840 --> 21:28.600
as local data stored on your computer,

21:28.600 --> 21:30.640
and try to keep as much information off

21:30.640 --> 21:32.520
of elementary servers as possible.

21:32.520 --> 21:33.840
Yeah, I would agree with that.

21:33.840 --> 21:35.880
Who wants that hassle?

21:35.880 --> 21:36.800
Good.

21:36.800 --> 21:39.120
I think that answers Colonel's question, too, that he had.

21:39.120 --> 21:41.120
Yeah, it's clear that there's been a lot of thought

21:41.120 --> 21:42.680
put into the design here.

21:42.680 --> 21:46.400
It feels like the project is transitioning

21:46.400 --> 21:50.400
to the next level of involvement with the wider community.

21:50.400 --> 21:52.880
Because I think also, Cassidy, of your recent work

21:52.880 --> 21:55.360
with the free desktop standard around dark theming,

21:55.360 --> 21:57.360
and going to these events, and speaking there,

21:57.360 --> 22:00.320
and having a presence, and being part of the conversation

22:00.320 --> 22:02.680
around those things, as well as something like this,

22:02.680 --> 22:08.480
working with Endless, and putting something actually

22:08.480 --> 22:10.880
usable around Flatpak for payments.

22:10.880 --> 22:13.040
It's going to have wider implications than just what

22:13.040 --> 22:17.800
happens on elementary OS, but should also, hopefully,

22:17.800 --> 22:20.440
improve the app ecosystem on elementary OS, as well.

22:20.440 --> 22:23.240
So I think it's a very clever strategy, gentlemen.

22:23.240 --> 22:23.960
Well done.

22:23.960 --> 22:24.440
Thank you.

22:24.440 --> 22:27.360
Yeah, we love that whole coopertition angle.

22:27.360 --> 22:29.040
We can work together, and build things,

22:29.040 --> 22:31.240
and compete a little bit.

22:31.240 --> 22:33.440
But we're all building free software,

22:33.440 --> 22:34.760
so let's just work together.

22:34.760 --> 22:36.480
And the rest of us get to benefit.

22:36.480 --> 22:41.680
I think, too, it's worth mentioning how important

22:41.680 --> 22:44.520
I personally believe it is to have

22:44.520 --> 22:48.600
a way to pay for decent third-party applications.

22:48.600 --> 22:53.120
When I tried out the Mac with the eGPU a couple of weeks

22:53.120 --> 22:59.560
ago, and loaded some application to manage Final Cut libraries,

22:59.560 --> 23:02.400
just to several apps that are also available for iOS,

23:02.400 --> 23:05.520
so I installed them on the Mac to match my iPhone.

23:05.520 --> 23:06.960
And the quality of the applications,

23:06.960 --> 23:14.600
while you pay $4, $5, $6 to $15 for them, is really strong.

23:14.600 --> 23:17.600
It benefits from the platform having a clear direction

23:17.600 --> 23:20.040
for developers to build applications,

23:20.040 --> 23:22.360
publish them in a central repository,

23:22.360 --> 23:24.480
and charge a fee so that way they can justify

23:24.480 --> 23:25.640
the time spent on them.

23:25.640 --> 23:27.760
Got the support they need to make it sustainable.

23:27.760 --> 23:30.200
And they've managed to make it work

23:30.200 --> 23:34.360
with their crazy, restrictive, overly controlled app center

23:34.360 --> 23:35.200
model.

23:35.200 --> 23:37.240
And this is something that's more universal,

23:37.240 --> 23:38.760
that could be cross-distribution,

23:38.760 --> 23:41.040
but still give us some of those core benefits.

23:41.040 --> 23:44.160
It's a way to do it better than the way Apple does it,

23:44.160 --> 23:46.240
but still reap some of those benefits

23:46.240 --> 23:49.000
of giving developers the ability to feed themselves.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.200
And I mean, since the days of Linux Action Show early,

23:53.200 --> 23:55.760
I have been trying to harp on this point.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.680
I've given up.

23:57.680 --> 23:58.800
I really have.

23:58.800 --> 24:03.480
You know, when Ubuntu's App Store didn't really work out,

24:03.480 --> 24:05.040
and I just kind of gave up.

24:05.040 --> 24:08.360
I just thought, all right, this isn't the path to monetization.

24:08.360 --> 24:10.120
But then when I visited the Mac recently,

24:10.120 --> 24:12.600
and you can see the collective benefits now

24:12.600 --> 24:15.040
of many years of having these APIs,

24:15.040 --> 24:17.120
and having these standards, and having these tools,

24:17.120 --> 24:19.080
much like elementary OS does, actually,

24:19.080 --> 24:22.880
having these things in place many years down the road

24:22.880 --> 24:24.280
really does have its benefits.

24:24.280 --> 24:25.760
And you guys are laying down some

24:25.760 --> 24:27.920
of the most essential frameworks right now.

24:27.920 --> 24:31.000
So I'm really pleased to see it got funded.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.080
And I think it should probably be at $15,000, $20,000.

24:34.080 --> 24:35.960
So I say everybody go fund it.

24:35.960 --> 24:36.560
Well, I did.

24:36.560 --> 24:38.560
We'll have a link in the show notes, of course.

24:38.560 --> 24:42.000
Yep, indiegogo.com slash project slash appcenter dash

24:42.000 --> 24:43.600
forward dash everyone.

24:43.600 --> 24:44.200
Go there.

24:44.200 --> 24:46.800
Let's get them going, because isn't this

24:46.800 --> 24:50.040
exactly how we want to see other distributions operating, too?

24:50.040 --> 24:51.800
And the thing that's pretty great about this

24:51.800 --> 24:53.400
is it's a direct lever.

24:53.400 --> 24:56.160
The users and the community are funding this.

24:56.160 --> 24:58.960
They, as a team, are getting together and producing code.

24:58.960 --> 25:02.160
It's a pretty great opportunity to be directly involved

25:02.160 --> 25:03.160
with the development.

25:03.160 --> 25:04.640
And I would argue an opportunity you

25:04.640 --> 25:07.320
don't get with commercial software development

25:07.320 --> 25:09.640
ever, other than going and buying their products directly,

25:09.640 --> 25:11.320
which is a very detached way.

25:11.320 --> 25:13.120
You're directly helping developers.

25:13.120 --> 25:14.480
It's pretty special.

25:14.480 --> 25:16.920
So good luck.

25:16.920 --> 25:18.840
I will give it a ding for that one.

25:18.840 --> 25:20.160
And great work, gentlemen.

25:20.160 --> 25:20.920
Great work.

25:20.920 --> 25:21.840
Thank you.

25:21.840 --> 25:22.360
Thank you.

25:22.360 --> 25:24.880
Glad to see it proceeding.

25:24.880 --> 25:26.800
I think you launched it on a Friday, right?

25:26.800 --> 25:27.880
Who does that?

25:27.880 --> 25:28.480
Who launches it?

25:28.480 --> 25:29.160
Or was it Thursday?

25:29.160 --> 25:29.840
I can't remember.

25:29.840 --> 25:31.040
Yeah, it was Friday morning.

25:31.040 --> 25:32.120
It was kind of a weird time.

25:32.120 --> 25:33.600
And it blew up over the weekend.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.600
That's never going to work.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.800
Yeah, well, by like Monday, midday, Monday,

25:37.800 --> 25:39.560
you guys had already hit your goal, right?

25:39.560 --> 25:40.080
Yeah.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.240
Yeah, Monday afternoon.

25:41.240 --> 25:45.480
I really think you really played the game of getting out there,

25:45.480 --> 25:47.920
getting the word out there, casting the net as far

25:47.920 --> 25:50.840
as possible, thanking people, being part of the community

25:50.840 --> 25:51.760
while it was happening.

25:51.760 --> 25:53.600
And I think it paid off.

25:53.600 --> 25:56.640
And I'd love to hear how it goes.

25:56.640 --> 25:58.240
I would love to be able to go.

25:58.240 --> 25:59.440
Don't think it's going to be possible.

25:59.440 --> 26:01.200
But I was putting feelers out there.

26:01.200 --> 26:04.200
But if nothing else, love to have one of you guys join us

26:04.200 --> 26:06.200
or both of you join us again to just kind of give us

26:06.200 --> 26:08.840
an update afterwards to let everybody know how it went.

26:08.840 --> 26:10.440
I think that'd be really cool if you could make it work.

26:10.440 --> 26:11.240
We'll do, yeah.

26:11.240 --> 26:11.880
Thank you, guys.

26:11.880 --> 26:13.080
Wonderful.

26:13.080 --> 26:14.960
One note before we get to Fosdom.

26:14.960 --> 26:17.480
And I don't know if we're going to keep doing this anymore.

26:17.480 --> 26:19.360
It's sort of gotten a life of its own.

26:19.360 --> 26:22.120
And it's this burnout topic we've talked about.

26:22.120 --> 26:24.440
And you'll recall this really kind of came up,

26:24.440 --> 26:29.280
I want to say, almost a month ago on the show when, well,

26:29.280 --> 26:32.880
it really kind of came up when a PPA maintainer got really

26:32.880 --> 26:35.720
frustrated by demands that were being put on him

26:35.720 --> 26:39.280
and pulled his PPAs, which included ZFS on Linux

26:39.280 --> 26:43.360
for Ubuntu and a bunch of other really critical packages.

26:43.360 --> 26:45.760
And that's when the burnout conversation came up.

26:45.760 --> 26:47.280
And we found this clip from Fosdom,

26:47.280 --> 26:49.560
which I think we'll just play now, because it almost

26:49.560 --> 26:52.800
perfectly summarizes the issue that that developer was

26:52.800 --> 26:56.400
going through, as well as, what was the blog we read, Wes,

26:56.400 --> 26:56.960
that was super cool?

26:56.960 --> 26:59.000
Oh, yeah, Drew DeVault's post about just

26:59.000 --> 27:02.440
how hard and beautiful it is to work in FOS software.

27:02.440 --> 27:05.080
That was a good post and really got us thinking about this.

27:05.080 --> 27:07.720
And you found a clip from Fosdom.

27:07.720 --> 27:09.360
It does have a bit of audio noise.

27:09.360 --> 27:10.760
I think it's just on a wireless mic,

27:10.760 --> 27:12.160
but it's totally understandable.

27:12.160 --> 27:14.840
All projects go through, or successful projects,

27:14.840 --> 27:17.680
go through a sort of, please, please contribute

27:17.680 --> 27:20.400
to my project, please like me, to a, oh, my god,

27:20.400 --> 27:22.360
what do I do with everybody liking me so much?

27:22.360 --> 27:24.880
This is a scaling problem in open source.

27:24.880 --> 27:29.000
And in Linux, the crisis point was actually reached in 2002,

27:29.000 --> 27:29.840
which is pretty good.

27:29.840 --> 27:35.480
This is 11 years after the initial project started.

27:35.480 --> 27:39.200
Up till 2002, every patch that went into Linux,

27:39.200 --> 27:41.760
and I believe you've seen Greg Crow Hartman's statistics

27:41.760 --> 27:44.680
telling you today about how many tens to,

27:44.680 --> 27:46.800
we're approaching hundreds of thousands of patches

27:46.800 --> 27:50.120
emerged by each release cycle, every patch

27:50.120 --> 27:52.720
was emailed personally to Linus and personally integrated

27:52.720 --> 27:53.440
by him.

27:53.440 --> 27:55.800
This gives you an idea, given the patch volume

27:55.800 --> 27:58.480
we accept today, of why this model just wouldn't scale.

27:58.480 --> 28:01.040
And like I said, the scaling point was reached in 2002.

28:01.040 --> 28:03.960
Linus just was starting to burn out and couldn't cope.

28:03.960 --> 28:06.120
But we talked about it a lot in terms

28:06.120 --> 28:08.800
of software development, open source sustainability.

28:08.800 --> 28:10.880
But one of the things I've heard from the audience

28:10.880 --> 28:14.040
is it hits them at work as a system administrator,

28:14.040 --> 28:16.920
or in sales, or Tim hit me up on Telegram

28:16.920 --> 28:19.600
and said that he's just been fighting at home,

28:19.600 --> 28:21.560
working at home, being burned out

28:21.560 --> 28:24.760
by all of the things that are at home that are not work,

28:24.760 --> 28:26.360
like the dishes or the laundry.

28:26.360 --> 28:27.840
Everything else you're behind on.

28:27.840 --> 28:28.800
Yeah, everything else.

28:28.800 --> 28:31.160
And he finds it distracting, which is pretty cool,

28:31.160 --> 28:32.400
because Brent, you chimed in.

28:32.400 --> 28:33.680
You were in the conversation, and you

28:33.680 --> 28:35.200
chimed in with a couple of suggestions

28:35.200 --> 28:36.960
that you follow when you're working from home

28:36.960 --> 28:38.120
and kind of feeling that way.

28:38.120 --> 28:39.440
Support is a huge one.

28:39.440 --> 28:41.320
Feeling like you're connected to other people

28:41.320 --> 28:43.360
and sharing ideas is massive.

28:43.360 --> 28:45.560
I think you'd mentioned in there going for a walk too.

28:45.560 --> 28:48.200
And Alex suggested sometimes even just getting up

28:48.200 --> 28:49.720
and switching locations.

28:49.720 --> 28:51.600
Yeah, going for a walk changes up your ideas.

28:51.600 --> 28:53.040
Like, you've done this, Chris.

28:53.040 --> 28:54.560
Just go for a 10, 20 minute walk,

28:54.560 --> 28:58.200
and it's amazing how that resets your mindset.

28:58.200 --> 28:59.560
And also switching locations.

28:59.560 --> 29:02.840
I try to only do work in that specific chair

29:02.840 --> 29:05.440
in that corner of that room so that when I'm not there,

29:05.440 --> 29:06.520
I'm not thinking of work.

29:06.520 --> 29:07.800
But the opposite's also true.

29:07.800 --> 29:10.320
When I'm sitting there, all I'm doing is work.

29:10.320 --> 29:11.880
I'm trying not to do other stuff.

29:11.880 --> 29:12.760
That's interesting.

29:12.760 --> 29:14.560
Tim said that one of the things that he did

29:14.560 --> 29:17.160
was he set a little bit of time aside

29:17.160 --> 29:20.160
to just focus on cleaning his workbench first

29:20.160 --> 29:21.760
and took it away from watching YouTube time,

29:21.760 --> 29:22.600
which I thought.

29:22.600 --> 29:23.440
Oh, that's nice.

29:23.440 --> 29:25.040
We could probably all make a few cuts here or there.

29:25.040 --> 29:26.720
Or even if you just set yourself,

29:26.720 --> 29:29.080
okay, I'm gonna spend X amount of time every day

29:29.080 --> 29:31.760
working on this thing that's driving me crazy.

29:31.760 --> 29:34.080
Then when you are trying to focus on your work

29:34.080 --> 29:35.760
and it starts to creep into your mind,

29:35.760 --> 29:37.360
you can remind yourself, don't worry,

29:37.360 --> 29:39.960
you've set time, you've dedicated time to deal with that.

29:39.960 --> 29:41.080
It can help you stay focused

29:41.080 --> 29:43.400
and gives you a little more energy too once you get it done.

29:43.400 --> 29:45.280
My experiment, I talked about it last week,

29:45.280 --> 29:47.960
was I launched The Chris Last Cast.

29:47.960 --> 29:50.960
And that was really interesting

29:50.960 --> 29:51.920
because it was a chance for me

29:51.920 --> 29:53.960
to try totally different equipment,

29:53.960 --> 29:56.080
totally different recording styles.

29:56.080 --> 30:01.080
And I even did one episode that I honestly was scared.

30:01.120 --> 30:03.600
I thought about pulling a couple of times,

30:03.600 --> 30:05.520
which I haven't pushed myself in that way

30:05.520 --> 30:07.400
in a really long time.

30:07.400 --> 30:11.520
So that felt kind of like I was starting,

30:11.520 --> 30:12.920
it felt new again.

30:12.920 --> 30:13.760
It felt really new.

30:13.760 --> 30:18.080
That was, I feel like that kind of energize

30:18.080 --> 30:21.040
I got from taking a risk and then having it work out.

30:23.560 --> 30:27.080
I have carried that momentum into the shows this week.

30:27.080 --> 30:28.560
Here, it's been a really interesting kind of-

30:28.560 --> 30:31.040
Even though it was, I mean, more work that you had to do

30:31.040 --> 30:32.400
and a lot of investment,

30:32.400 --> 30:34.800
I can still end up having benefits and dividends

30:34.800 --> 30:35.840
way ahead of proportion.

30:35.840 --> 30:37.800
But kind of like Tim, I just watched less YouTube.

30:37.800 --> 30:38.640
That's really what I did.

30:38.640 --> 30:39.480
Well, there you go.

30:39.480 --> 30:41.440
And I launched a long-term project

30:41.440 --> 30:45.040
called Work Life and RV at worklifeandrv.com.

30:45.040 --> 30:46.640
And I launched a blog as well

30:46.640 --> 30:47.880
that my wife and I did together.

30:47.880 --> 30:51.360
And we blogged about our solar upgrade.

30:51.360 --> 30:56.120
We've got pictures in there and our junkyard home base,

30:56.120 --> 30:56.960
we did a blog-

30:56.960 --> 30:57.800
Oh, it's really lovely.

30:57.800 --> 30:59.280
I'm curious, what'd you use for your blog?

30:59.280 --> 31:00.120
Oh, don't worry.

31:00.120 --> 31:00.960
I'm gonna do an episode on it.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.400
Okay, okay.

31:02.400 --> 31:04.920
Yeah, that's definitely something self-hosted

31:04.920 --> 31:06.160
that we're gonna be talking about,

31:06.160 --> 31:08.120
which actually talked a little bit about

31:08.120 --> 31:10.600
some of the hosting in, I think, self-hosted,

31:10.600 --> 31:14.080
I wanna say 11, so you can catch that.

31:14.080 --> 31:14.920
I don't know, I've had a lot of fun.

31:14.920 --> 31:16.960
It was like, it was a total lark.

31:16.960 --> 31:17.880
Like, I'll just try this.

31:17.880 --> 31:19.360
And it went really well.

31:19.360 --> 31:20.840
So I'm gonna stick with some of it.

31:20.840 --> 31:22.720
Probably won't do it with very many Chris Lastcasts.

31:22.720 --> 31:25.200
I'll probably keep it going a little bit though.

31:25.200 --> 31:28.280
But the Work Life and RV thing really got a good reception.

31:28.280 --> 31:30.120
And I've got a lot to say there.

31:30.120 --> 31:33.280
And it just totally doesn't fit on the JB network.

31:33.280 --> 31:34.640
Right, a little extra space on the side

31:34.640 --> 31:35.800
so you don't have to compromise

31:35.800 --> 31:37.080
on how you talk about it or cover it.

31:37.080 --> 31:38.040
You can really dive in.

31:38.040 --> 31:40.320
Yeah, and that's obviously something

31:40.320 --> 31:41.160
I've got a lot of experience.

31:41.160 --> 31:42.840
I've been doing it for five years.

31:42.840 --> 31:44.360
You only talk about it all the time.

31:44.360 --> 31:46.120
Yeah, off air, it's like pretty much all I talk about.

31:46.120 --> 31:49.360
So it gives me an outlet that doesn't sort of,

31:49.360 --> 31:52.200
you know, wreck the on-air content at JP.

31:52.200 --> 31:53.520
But be honest about it.

31:53.520 --> 31:54.360
It was just a really,

31:54.360 --> 31:55.520
it was a really interesting experience.

31:55.520 --> 31:57.160
It was a challenge that I put out there last week,

31:57.160 --> 31:58.840
and I'm really glad that we did it.

31:58.840 --> 32:00.840
And I got a few positive things.

32:01.840 --> 32:03.200
I'd love to hear other people's results

32:03.200 --> 32:05.440
at linuxunplug.com slash contact.

32:05.440 --> 32:07.040
Your last episode of Chris Lastcast,

32:07.040 --> 32:09.720
the one you did with Jason Spizak.

32:09.720 --> 32:11.520
Man, that was a good episode.

32:11.520 --> 32:12.800
I really loved it.

32:12.800 --> 32:16.000
I ended up just sitting down and listening to it,

32:16.000 --> 32:18.200
just me and the podcast for like an hour.

32:18.200 --> 32:20.320
It was, it was great.

32:20.320 --> 32:22.680
So please, hopefully you're getting some good,

32:22.680 --> 32:25.040
good feedback and I'd love to hear more of that.

32:25.040 --> 32:25.880
Well, thank you.

32:25.880 --> 32:27.240
That was the one that I was the most nervous about

32:27.240 --> 32:29.720
because I went out there with the title.

32:29.720 --> 32:32.320
You know, I also was,

32:32.320 --> 32:35.280
I gave me a chance to practice listening better

32:35.280 --> 32:36.520
and not speaking as much.

32:36.520 --> 32:39.040
And so I, at times I just put my hand over my mouth,

32:39.040 --> 32:40.600
I would just listen and give,

32:40.600 --> 32:42.240
give him the space to finish his thought,

32:42.240 --> 32:45.440
which is something that I don't do as often

32:45.440 --> 32:47.280
on the live shows because we are live

32:47.280 --> 32:49.280
and we are sticking to a time limit and we move on.

32:49.280 --> 32:50.320
Right, you have to manage the flow.

32:50.320 --> 32:54.080
Yeah, and so it was a chance for me to practice a skill

32:54.080 --> 32:56.480
that isn't my primary skill when I'm hosting,

32:56.480 --> 32:58.520
but one that I need to develop further.

32:59.800 --> 33:00.640
And Jason's great.

33:00.640 --> 33:02.440
You know, he's got a, he's got a great audio setup.

33:02.440 --> 33:04.480
He's got two different professional audio studios.

33:04.480 --> 33:06.320
He runs them all on Linux.

33:06.320 --> 33:07.160
Incredible.

33:07.160 --> 33:08.480
And the man can talk about anything.

33:08.480 --> 33:11.000
So, and he's, I think he's a, he's a wise man too.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.320
So thank you, Brent.

33:12.320 --> 33:13.360
I don't know if I would have done it

33:13.360 --> 33:15.720
if this burnout topic hadn't come up,

33:15.720 --> 33:17.480
but I felt like I needed to kind of get

33:17.480 --> 33:19.280
the energy level up a little bit,

33:19.280 --> 33:21.080
but I needed to do things out of the box

33:21.080 --> 33:23.120
that would scare me and challenge me a little bit.

33:23.120 --> 33:25.640
Right, get out of the, get out of the grind, feel refreshed.

33:25.640 --> 33:29.040
Yeah, and, and then I, then I feel more focused than ever.

33:29.040 --> 33:30.800
It's been an interesting process.

33:30.800 --> 33:31.640
Been a good challenge.

33:31.640 --> 33:32.640
It was, I'm glad we did it.

33:32.640 --> 33:35.040
I almost want to, I almost want to keep it going,

33:35.040 --> 33:38.000
but I think now I'm just going to try to find a balance,

33:38.000 --> 33:40.520
which I think is what we all, we all have to do.

33:40.520 --> 33:43.560
Few quick housekeeping items.

33:43.560 --> 33:44.400
I don't have a bunch in here

33:44.400 --> 33:46.640
other than to go say check out Brunch with Brent

33:46.640 --> 33:48.040
with Peter Adams, if you haven't yet.

33:48.040 --> 33:50.080
Part one and two are both posted.

33:50.080 --> 33:53.040
He's the photographer behind the faces of open source,

33:53.040 --> 33:54.000
a great thinker himself,

33:54.000 --> 33:56.120
and that was also a great conversation.

33:56.120 --> 33:57.440
And our telegram group.

33:57.440 --> 34:01.160
Now I think over, is it over 1500 now, Sol?

34:01.160 --> 34:02.000
Did we stay there?

34:02.000 --> 34:02.840
Yes, I think so.

34:02.840 --> 34:04.160
We were bouncing around all weekend.

34:04.160 --> 34:05.760
No, we're at 1499.

34:05.760 --> 34:07.840
Oh, oh, come on.

34:07.840 --> 34:09.240
One, one away.

34:09.240 --> 34:10.920
Here's my commitment.

34:10.920 --> 34:13.040
If we can get all, if we can cross 1500

34:13.040 --> 34:15.440
and get all of you in one space,

34:15.440 --> 34:17.160
I will buy PBRs for everyone.

34:17.160 --> 34:20.600
It's like 1500 bucks, dude, I mean.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.040
I know, but dude, how, but come on.

34:22.040 --> 34:23.080
We're never going to get everybody together.

34:23.080 --> 34:24.840
But I do feel like we should get

34:24.840 --> 34:26.360
like a telegram hangout going.

34:26.360 --> 34:27.960
That would be really great.

34:27.960 --> 34:29.760
Like a meetup every now and then.

34:29.760 --> 34:31.400
Something, there's something there,

34:31.400 --> 34:32.600
something there that we got to look into.

34:32.600 --> 34:35.480
So that's at Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash telegram.

34:35.480 --> 34:38.120
Conversation keep going after the here show.

34:38.120 --> 34:39.400
So you can go check that out.

34:39.400 --> 34:42.200
And that's really, I think all the housekeeping I got.

34:42.200 --> 34:43.040
I think that's it, Wes.

34:43.040 --> 34:44.360
You got anything else?

34:44.360 --> 34:46.120
That looks pretty clean around here.

34:46.120 --> 34:46.960
The bell has rung.

34:46.960 --> 34:48.640
Yeah, well, that's what happens, you know,

34:48.640 --> 34:51.280
when we clean up after ourselves.

34:51.280 --> 34:53.040
So FOSDEM 2020.

34:53.040 --> 34:55.920
FOSDEM was started in 2000.

34:55.920 --> 34:57.120
It was a different name back then,

34:57.120 --> 34:58.800
but essentially the same thing.

34:58.800 --> 35:02.160
And entrance and participation is entirely free.

35:02.160 --> 35:04.000
It's financed by sponsors who accept

35:04.000 --> 35:06.520
the non-commercial nature of the event.

35:06.520 --> 35:08.600
And there's donors amongst the visitors.

35:08.600 --> 35:09.440
You can donate,

35:09.440 --> 35:10.840
which a lot of people in our audience have.

35:10.840 --> 35:11.680
Absolutely.

35:11.680 --> 35:13.760
Donors receive a form and a token

35:13.760 --> 35:16.040
that gives them like, you know, an extra little note.

35:16.040 --> 35:17.280
Ooh.

35:17.280 --> 35:18.120
Little, I don't know, what do you call that?

35:18.120 --> 35:18.960
Flare?

35:18.960 --> 35:19.880
Yeah, Flare.

35:19.880 --> 35:23.840
And so it's like a four, 5,000 plus event.

35:23.840 --> 35:24.720
Carl, you were there?

35:24.720 --> 35:25.560
Yes, sir.

35:25.560 --> 35:27.960
Did you get a rough figure of the numbers?

35:27.960 --> 35:30.200
It's a little weird because the thing is spread

35:30.200 --> 35:33.000
across a lot of different buildings on that college campus.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.280
So every building's jam packed,

35:35.280 --> 35:37.640
but you never get a sense of all of the people

35:37.640 --> 35:39.080
all at one time.

35:39.080 --> 35:39.920
Yeah, okay.

35:39.920 --> 35:41.640
That would be hard to measure, you're right.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.640
Carl, I'd like to get your take on FOSDEM

35:43.640 --> 35:46.400
compared to events here in the States.

35:46.400 --> 35:47.640
It was definitely very different.

35:47.640 --> 35:49.760
It was the first FOSDEM I'd been to.

35:49.760 --> 35:51.720
I've always heard about it.

35:51.720 --> 35:53.080
The biggest thing that struck me

35:53.080 --> 35:54.560
other than the number of people there

35:54.560 --> 35:56.840
was that it was a lot different projects

35:56.840 --> 35:57.920
that showed up there.

35:57.920 --> 36:00.800
I've never seen Gnome at a Stateside conference,

36:00.800 --> 36:01.640
for instance.

36:01.640 --> 36:04.080
So I managed to get me a lot of Gnome stickers.

36:04.080 --> 36:05.240
I got an F-Droid sticker.

36:05.240 --> 36:07.240
I'd never seen them in a conference before.

36:07.240 --> 36:09.640
A lot of projects like that, that for whatever reason,

36:09.640 --> 36:11.560
have a lot more European contributors

36:11.560 --> 36:14.240
and they're regulars there at FOSDEM,

36:14.240 --> 36:16.600
but they don't come Stateside for whatever reason.

36:16.600 --> 36:17.440
That makes sense.

36:17.440 --> 36:18.680
I mean, I don't make it over there very often.

36:18.680 --> 36:19.520
Indeed.

36:19.520 --> 36:20.360
Which is a real shame.

36:20.360 --> 36:21.840
So, I mean, I've always wanted to.

36:21.840 --> 36:23.560
So I'm glad you're able to make it, Carl.

36:23.560 --> 36:24.400
That's pretty great.

36:24.400 --> 36:25.400
Would you go again?

36:25.400 --> 36:27.520
Probably won't have a choice with my new job.

36:27.520 --> 36:30.360
CentOS, I'm working on CentOS now for Red Hat.

36:30.360 --> 36:32.960
And so they're probably going to have me go back there again.

36:32.960 --> 36:35.560
Next year, I'd like to actually make it to a few more talks.

36:35.560 --> 36:39.080
This year, I did spend most of my time at the CentOS booth

36:39.080 --> 36:41.320
and meeting a lot of my new teammates.

36:42.400 --> 36:45.440
I went to a couple of talks in the distribution dev room.

36:45.440 --> 36:48.200
And what I realized was that I went in the morning,

36:48.200 --> 36:50.920
but once you leave, you can't really get back in

36:50.920 --> 36:52.280
because there's just a waiting,

36:52.280 --> 36:54.680
a line of people waiting to get back in.

36:54.680 --> 36:58.440
And so if you want to, if you have a dev room

36:58.440 --> 37:01.040
that you want to see the talks at for the day,

37:01.040 --> 37:03.960
get there early and just camp out there the entire day.

37:03.960 --> 37:05.400
Like don't even drink water

37:05.400 --> 37:07.920
because you'll have to get up to go to the bathroom.

37:07.920 --> 37:10.480
Oh, Ace Nomad, there was a bit of a JB mini meetup

37:10.480 --> 37:11.480
at FOSDEM, eh?

37:11.480 --> 37:12.320
Yeah, there is.

37:12.320 --> 37:14.480
I saw ByteBitten for the first time

37:14.480 --> 37:17.200
as well as Bitten throughout the conference.

37:17.200 --> 37:19.160
And I knew there was a few other

37:19.160 --> 37:21.480
JB community members there as well.

37:21.480 --> 37:25.280
I actually got to meet Carl at the very, very tail end

37:25.280 --> 37:29.880
of the last part of the day for a couple of minutes.

37:29.880 --> 37:32.280
So yeah, it was great.

37:32.280 --> 37:33.120
That's neat.

37:33.120 --> 37:33.960
Fantastic.

37:33.960 --> 37:36.320
FOSDEM pumps out videos

37:36.320 --> 37:39.600
like no other conference pumps out videos.

37:39.600 --> 37:40.560
Very impressive.

37:40.560 --> 37:43.040
It might be like 800 videos for this event so far.

37:43.040 --> 37:45.160
And the turnaround between like when the conference happened

37:45.160 --> 37:47.040
and the videos being up, wow.

37:47.040 --> 37:49.720
Now we went through as many of these as we could

37:50.640 --> 37:52.320
and pulled out a few gems

37:52.320 --> 37:53.600
because there's some great stuff in there

37:53.600 --> 37:55.960
and nobody can go to everything

37:55.960 --> 37:57.960
and nobody could go through all of those clips

37:57.960 --> 37:59.080
but we gave it a good shot.

37:59.080 --> 38:00.800
And something about me recently

38:00.800 --> 38:03.160
has really been enjoying the history aspect

38:03.160 --> 38:04.240
of Unix and Linux.

38:04.240 --> 38:05.920
And guess what?

38:05.920 --> 38:08.360
I found a talk that talks about

38:08.360 --> 38:11.600
some of the very early linkages in Unix history.

38:11.600 --> 38:14.960
They were absolutely fundamental to get where we are today

38:14.960 --> 38:16.360
that we never talk about.

38:16.360 --> 38:20.080
And one of them was almost completely lost to time.

38:20.080 --> 38:24.320
And it's called the PDP-7

38:24.320 --> 38:26.360
and it's a huge machine.

38:26.360 --> 38:28.360
But what's a PDP-7?

38:28.360 --> 38:30.640
It's a mini computer

38:30.640 --> 38:35.440
that Digital Equipment Corporation, DEC, produced

38:35.440 --> 38:37.800
in the 60s and 70s.

38:37.800 --> 38:40.600
And it was one of a line of 18-bit computers.

38:40.600 --> 38:42.200
Now 18-bit sounds kind of weird.

38:42.200 --> 38:45.400
We're used to 16 or 32 or 64 bits.

38:45.400 --> 38:46.960
But at the time DEC came out with this,

38:46.960 --> 38:49.000
all the mainframes were 36 bits.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.880
So 18 made sense.

38:50.880 --> 38:52.520
It was like half a mainframe or something

38:52.520 --> 38:55.680
kind of in the thinking of the time.

38:55.680 --> 38:57.280
An 18-bit computer.

38:57.280 --> 38:58.600
Mini computer.

38:58.600 --> 39:01.480
And we wouldn't likely have the Berkeley BSDs

39:01.480 --> 39:04.160
if it wasn't for this rig.

39:04.160 --> 39:05.800
And it was lost to history

39:05.800 --> 39:08.600
because simply records were lost

39:08.600 --> 39:12.520
and documentation on these punch cards was lost.

39:12.520 --> 39:14.920
PDP-7 Unix is largely a footnote in history.

39:14.920 --> 39:17.360
Nobody uses it today, nobody knows about it today

39:17.360 --> 39:21.960
except maybe a quick question to a trivia,

39:21.960 --> 39:24.520
or an answer to a trivia question.

39:24.520 --> 39:27.720
But it was very important in building credibility

39:27.720 --> 39:29.480
for this group at Bell Labs.

39:29.480 --> 39:34.000
They had just spent five years with a failure in Multics

39:34.000 --> 39:36.920
and they needed some wind they could show.

39:36.920 --> 39:39.600
So they were able to use the PDP-7,

39:39.600 --> 39:41.840
show it to people, show how useful it was,

39:41.840 --> 39:45.000
and were able to get the patent department

39:45.000 --> 39:49.000
to buy the PDP-11 to port Unix to.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.200
For a long time it was believed

39:50.200 --> 39:51.640
the sources were lost to history.

39:51.640 --> 39:54.800
There's no binary artifacts from this time.

39:54.800 --> 39:57.160
Nothing really survived.

39:57.160 --> 39:59.440
But there have been a few recent discoveries.

39:59.440 --> 40:04.480
One of them was in the home of a man named Robert Morris.

40:04.480 --> 40:07.040
It's probably a name you're not familiar with.

40:07.040 --> 40:10.640
But he invented something you likely use every single day.

40:10.640 --> 40:13.840
In 2011, Robert Morris Sr. passed away.

40:13.840 --> 40:17.040
Now he was a security researcher at Bell Labs

40:17.040 --> 40:19.200
in the 60s, 70s, and 80s.

40:19.200 --> 40:21.720
And he did a lot of security things on Unix.

40:21.720 --> 40:24.600
Probably the one you're most familiar with is Etsy Password.

40:25.600 --> 40:28.640
And when he passed away he had a huge collection of papers

40:28.640 --> 40:31.200
that took a long time to go through.

40:31.200 --> 40:33.920
So his estate asked Doug McGilroy,

40:33.920 --> 40:36.640
who was another person from Bell Labs,

40:36.640 --> 40:37.480
to go through the papers

40:37.480 --> 40:40.040
and sort out the ones of historical relevance.

40:40.040 --> 40:42.840
And in here they find old Unix manuals,

40:42.840 --> 40:44.840
maybe even what might be source code

40:44.840 --> 40:47.400
that is literally printed out.

40:47.400 --> 40:49.280
But they don't go much further with it

40:49.280 --> 40:51.600
until about a year later.

40:51.600 --> 40:53.360
The next year, in 2016,

40:54.960 --> 40:58.040
Norm Wilson was going through his garage

40:58.040 --> 41:00.520
and found this notebook of Unix source

41:00.520 --> 41:03.560
that he had copied while he worked at Bell Labs.

41:03.560 --> 41:08.560
And it turns out that it was the PDP-7 kernel listing

41:08.560 --> 41:12.760
and the user utilities A through F.

41:12.760 --> 41:17.200
So a group with a twos group typed this all in

41:17.200 --> 41:20.280
because you might think this would work to OCR,

41:20.280 --> 41:22.560
but when you OCR it and you get all kinds of errors

41:22.560 --> 41:23.760
and you have to recheck it anyway,

41:23.760 --> 41:26.200
so it's faster just to type it all in.

41:26.200 --> 41:28.360
So they typed it all in and created an image

41:28.360 --> 41:32.600
and enhanced SimH simulator to run it.

41:32.600 --> 41:36.520
And now you can run PDP-7 Unix.

41:36.520 --> 41:38.840
You can run it because they typed in by hand

41:38.840 --> 41:40.440
the source code that was printed out.

41:40.440 --> 41:41.840
Glad I didn't have that job.

41:41.840 --> 41:43.760
I know.

41:43.760 --> 41:44.600
I know.

41:44.600 --> 41:47.360
And it was sort of the granddaddy

41:47.360 --> 41:50.760
to what later became the Unixs that became the BSDs

41:50.760 --> 41:53.680
that eventually became the BSD wars,

41:53.680 --> 41:55.160
which led to the revolution

41:55.160 --> 41:57.360
that was Linux and free software and-

41:57.360 --> 42:00.000
It's an amazingly rich history that we're a part of.

42:00.000 --> 42:03.400
Before we go from the past, there was one bit in there too,

42:03.400 --> 42:04.480
we'll link to the full talk,

42:04.480 --> 42:06.160
but there was one bit in there.

42:06.160 --> 42:09.400
That you really got to appreciate.

42:09.400 --> 42:13.800
And that was what a crap show early networking was.

42:13.800 --> 42:15.160
I mean, you might remember,

42:15.160 --> 42:19.400
if you can recall token ring networks and net buoy and IPX,

42:19.400 --> 42:21.200
there were so many different kinds of standards

42:21.200 --> 42:22.320
and ways to communicate.

42:22.320 --> 42:23.760
But more than that,

42:23.760 --> 42:27.400
there was fundamental philosophical differences

42:27.400 --> 42:31.240
on how the data should move around a network.

42:31.240 --> 42:33.480
Networking in Unix also goes back a long way.

42:33.480 --> 42:36.080
So a lot of people say, oh, it started with Berkeley

42:36.080 --> 42:39.160
and it turns out that there were a number of implementations

42:39.160 --> 42:42.480
before Berkeley did their stack.

42:42.480 --> 42:47.120
This is timeline wise, 1977.

42:47.120 --> 42:48.840
Before Berkeley at AT&T,

42:48.840 --> 42:50.200
there was something called data kit

42:50.200 --> 42:53.080
and at Berkeley, there was something called BerkNet.

42:53.080 --> 42:56.880
But BBN wrote the TCP IP stack

42:56.880 --> 42:59.240
that would actually later go into Berkeley.

43:00.160 --> 43:01.840
Berkeley added a sockets API,

43:01.840 --> 43:04.200
the BBN stack had a completely different API

43:04.200 --> 43:06.800
that was more file oriented

43:06.800 --> 43:08.400
and showed some of the limitations

43:08.400 --> 43:11.400
of the everything is a file paradigm.

43:11.400 --> 43:13.520
Isn't that fascinating?

43:13.520 --> 43:16.840
That of course was gonna be the Unix's first approach

43:16.840 --> 43:17.680
to networking.

43:17.680 --> 43:18.520
Just make it a file.

43:18.520 --> 43:19.360
Everything's a file.

43:19.360 --> 43:22.080
But the earliest ones, it's kind of a tie.

43:22.080 --> 43:23.360
There's something called Network Unix

43:23.360 --> 43:26.560
that the University of Illinois did in 74.

43:26.560 --> 43:30.480
And there's a spider cell network inside of AT&T.

43:30.480 --> 43:31.680
And I put both of these up there

43:31.680 --> 43:34.480
because it shows the split in thinking

43:34.480 --> 43:36.000
between these two groups.

43:36.000 --> 43:39.160
Everybody inside of AT&T was circuit switched.

43:39.160 --> 43:40.080
They're a phone company.

43:40.080 --> 43:42.040
They make circuit connections.

43:42.040 --> 43:44.160
So their networking was based on that.

43:44.160 --> 43:46.800
Everybody outside of AT&T was packet switched.

43:46.800 --> 43:47.640
Everything's virtual.

43:47.640 --> 43:48.880
We just send packets.

43:48.880 --> 43:51.440
And that's the school of thought that won.

43:51.440 --> 43:53.640
And that also explains why if you go back

43:53.640 --> 43:55.960
and look at these early Unix's,

43:55.960 --> 43:57.640
a lot of the ones from Bell Labs

43:57.640 --> 43:59.960
don't have any TCP IP stack

43:59.960 --> 44:02.600
because they had this giant blind spot.

44:02.600 --> 44:05.840
They thought everything was gonna be circuit switched.

44:05.840 --> 44:06.800
Wow, that's fascinating.

44:06.800 --> 44:08.800
I mean, it makes perfect sense, but wow.

44:08.800 --> 44:09.960
I know.

44:09.960 --> 44:11.680
It could have gone a different way.

44:11.680 --> 44:14.240
Now, to show you sort of the opposite side of FOSDEM,

44:14.240 --> 44:16.200
there's also a much more modern side.

44:16.200 --> 44:17.840
Ironically, right now while we stream,

44:17.840 --> 44:19.920
there's a conversation in the chat room

44:19.920 --> 44:21.520
about confusion around IRC.

44:21.520 --> 44:24.560
And this was one of the points that Matthew,

44:24.560 --> 44:25.920
I think it's Broberg?

44:27.200 --> 44:29.320
Yeah, that's a great name, Broberg.

44:29.320 --> 44:30.400
I love that. Absolutely.

44:30.400 --> 44:31.840
Matthew is making the point

44:31.840 --> 44:35.720
that none of you that are longtime Linux users

44:35.720 --> 44:37.040
are going to want to hear.

44:37.040 --> 44:40.080
And that is the next generation of contributors

44:40.080 --> 44:43.840
does not want to get on IRC.

44:43.840 --> 44:45.560
But my pathway is not the same

44:45.560 --> 44:47.720
as I know many others have gone through.

44:48.680 --> 44:53.080
That started with IRC just being a logical, simple thing.

44:53.080 --> 44:55.040
But for me, it's still this.

44:55.040 --> 44:56.920
Even though I understand where it comes from

44:56.920 --> 44:59.200
and I understand it had its place in time,

44:59.200 --> 45:01.880
I feel as if it's not as inviting

45:01.880 --> 45:03.720
as that incredible GitHub issue

45:03.720 --> 45:05.720
that didn't shame me or make me feel stupid.

45:05.720 --> 45:07.120
He's making the case that people

45:07.120 --> 45:09.280
who get into open source development

45:09.280 --> 45:11.920
sort of through the GitHub channels

45:11.920 --> 45:15.560
and Slack and all these other, Riot Chat,

45:15.560 --> 45:16.920
all these other platforms,

45:16.920 --> 45:20.800
they look at IRC as if it's something of the stone age.

45:20.800 --> 45:24.520
And he has numbers to back it up.

45:24.520 --> 45:25.560
To put it in some context,

45:25.560 --> 45:27.720
I understand when IRC came out

45:27.720 --> 45:29.320
and became the de facto standard,

45:29.320 --> 45:31.280
it's because there's a lot of empty space around.

45:31.280 --> 45:34.320
It was IRC or nothing to communicate.

45:34.320 --> 45:36.200
I guess telnetting and reading each other's things

45:36.200 --> 45:37.560
is something that I've read about as well,

45:37.560 --> 45:38.720
but I'll just put that aside.

45:38.720 --> 45:40.160
I don't know it very well.

45:40.160 --> 45:42.040
But if we fast forward to today,

45:42.040 --> 45:43.600
the stats I've been able to find

45:43.600 --> 45:46.840
is that IRC is hovering around 400,000 active users

45:46.840 --> 45:48.160
in the last year or so.

45:48.160 --> 45:49.640
And we look at some of the other

45:49.640 --> 45:51.040
synchronous communication channels

45:51.040 --> 45:52.360
that people are talking about.

45:52.360 --> 45:53.760
We've got Microsoft Teams.

45:53.760 --> 45:58.280
Okay, so 400,000 for IRC.

45:58.280 --> 45:59.120
This is a network effect.

45:59.120 --> 46:00.640
Do you have any guesses for Teams?

46:00.640 --> 46:02.160
Which you know is gonna be smaller than Slack.

46:02.160 --> 46:04.280
Yeah, it's gonna be smaller than Slack.

46:04.280 --> 46:06.720
Let's go with a million.

46:06.720 --> 46:08.400
Just people have to use that for work

46:08.400 --> 46:10.040
and don't necessarily love it.

46:10.040 --> 46:12.160
There's 13 million people on that.

46:12.160 --> 46:14.000
Slack, people love it.

46:14.000 --> 46:15.560
Open source communities hate it.

46:15.560 --> 46:17.320
12 million users.

46:17.320 --> 46:19.800
Riot.Iam, very impressive that they've grown

46:19.800 --> 46:22.240
to well over 11 million users.

46:22.240 --> 46:24.440
These numbers are odd because Teams, he says, is bigger,

46:24.440 --> 46:26.160
which I guess maybe it's possible.

46:26.160 --> 46:28.280
Microsoft has a reach.

46:28.280 --> 46:31.000
And Slack doesn't have the built-in market.

46:31.000 --> 46:31.840
Right, it's not just with your subscription.

46:31.840 --> 46:33.160
I can see it.

46:33.160 --> 46:36.320
But the really surprising one there was Riot Chat.

46:36.320 --> 46:37.160
That's great news.

46:37.160 --> 46:38.000
Yeah, it is.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.360
Google Chat, it's slowly waning in the background,

46:40.360 --> 46:42.280
but at four million.

46:42.280 --> 46:44.280
And that's just synchronous communication channels.

46:44.280 --> 46:45.440
And that's just recently.

46:45.440 --> 46:47.960
We zoom out even further and think about the ways

46:47.960 --> 46:49.480
in which we interact with communities

46:49.480 --> 46:50.960
in the technology space.

46:50.960 --> 46:53.440
You've got Twitter, which is my default place

46:53.440 --> 46:55.880
to conversate with community members.

46:55.880 --> 47:00.200
At 126 million users, Telegram is way more massive

47:00.200 --> 47:02.000
than I ever realized at 200 million.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.360
And a lot more open source communities are talking there.

47:04.360 --> 47:05.800
Discord is humongous.

47:05.800 --> 47:09.240
Reddit is a complete beast when we think about it.

47:09.240 --> 47:11.840
Yeah, when you consider some of the online communities,

47:11.840 --> 47:13.120
it's even more.

47:13.120 --> 47:16.440
So right now we have 271 people in our IRC room.

47:16.440 --> 47:23.000
And we've now crossed the 1,500 line at the Telegram group.

47:23.000 --> 47:27.000
I really feel like the end is nigh

47:27.000 --> 47:29.800
for IRC as a primary community communications tool.

47:29.800 --> 47:33.960
Yeah, I mean, does this mean IRC should just dwindle away

47:33.960 --> 47:34.800
and we move on?

47:34.800 --> 47:38.640
No, I think technology doesn't work like that.

47:38.640 --> 47:40.720
Even Betamax is actually still around.

47:40.720 --> 47:43.480
Not very much anymore, but for many years

47:43.480 --> 47:46.760
after the, quote unquote, Betamax VHS wars, production

47:46.760 --> 47:48.760
shops still used Betamax.

47:48.760 --> 47:52.560
Just because Sirius XM launches doesn't mean

47:52.560 --> 47:54.080
there's not FM radio still.

47:54.080 --> 47:55.560
It'll always be around.

47:55.560 --> 47:58.800
But I think when you're trying to draw in as many contributors

47:58.800 --> 48:03.280
as possible and bring in fresh contributors,

48:03.280 --> 48:05.400
I think it's something you've got to at least consider

48:05.400 --> 48:06.480
and think about.

48:06.480 --> 48:08.360
Yeah, it's not easy to get started with.

48:08.360 --> 48:10.960
And unless you really start learning it well,

48:10.960 --> 48:13.440
it doesn't have the features that people

48:13.440 --> 48:15.000
are used to or expecting, especially

48:15.000 --> 48:17.560
if you want contributors who are a little less dedicated

48:17.560 --> 48:20.160
and might just be doing this a couple weekends a month.

48:20.160 --> 48:23.280
Sure, and they want low barrier of entry.

48:23.280 --> 48:26.640
In his talk, he talks about how the whole Nixerv stuff,

48:26.640 --> 48:29.840
where it gets you to authenticate, is just too much.

48:29.840 --> 48:30.800
It was way too much.

48:30.800 --> 48:32.560
I felt like I was fighting the computer immediately

48:32.560 --> 48:33.560
as soon as I logged on.

48:33.560 --> 48:36.120
Cassidy, it sounds like you guys have some experience with this.

48:36.120 --> 48:38.200
Yeah, we used to do all of our development

48:38.200 --> 48:39.880
over on IRC for elementary.

48:39.880 --> 48:42.440
And honestly, one of the best decisions

48:42.440 --> 48:45.600
we've made as a project was moving away from IRC

48:45.600 --> 48:48.760
to two other mentalities.

48:48.760 --> 48:52.480
One is using non-real-time platforms better,

48:52.480 --> 48:54.240
like GitHub issue tracking.

48:54.240 --> 48:57.600
And then other chat apps are just a way better experience

48:57.600 --> 48:58.560
for people than IRC.

48:58.560 --> 48:59.440
And it's way easier.

48:59.440 --> 49:02.520
It lowers the barrier of entry to new contributors.

49:02.520 --> 49:04.200
The integration thing can be nice.

49:04.200 --> 49:06.000
And a lot of different platforms offer this,

49:06.000 --> 49:08.600
where you can tie it in with existing workflows

49:08.600 --> 49:10.320
or there's automatic notifications when

49:10.320 --> 49:11.560
somebody commits something.

49:11.560 --> 49:13.960
And you can have a conversation based around an issue

49:13.960 --> 49:15.880
right there in your main chat program.

49:15.880 --> 49:17.600
Yeah, exactly.

49:17.600 --> 49:19.320
We have a private Slack for contributors.

49:19.320 --> 49:21.080
And we call it our virtual private office.

49:21.080 --> 49:23.640
Because when you're working, you're in the office.

49:23.640 --> 49:24.280
You're in Slack.

49:24.280 --> 49:25.600
When you're not working, you close it.

49:25.600 --> 49:27.560
And you do all your communication right there.

49:27.560 --> 49:28.360
And it's great.

49:28.360 --> 49:29.000
Yeah.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.640
And it has a lot more support for I'm available.

49:31.640 --> 49:33.640
I'm in a meeting.

49:33.640 --> 49:35.440
Are you sure you want to disturb this person?

49:35.440 --> 49:37.720
Because they're in a different time zone.

49:37.720 --> 49:39.280
Like, these things matter when you're

49:39.280 --> 49:41.080
working in an international team.

49:41.080 --> 49:42.280
But I don't think it's gone.

49:42.280 --> 49:43.880
I'm not going to stop using IRC.

49:43.880 --> 49:46.520
But I think it will be relegated to probably

49:46.520 --> 49:47.680
the existing communities.

49:47.680 --> 49:49.760
I mean, those numbers are devastating.

49:49.760 --> 49:50.480
400,000.

49:50.480 --> 49:51.440
I mean, who knows if they're accurate.

49:51.440 --> 49:52.440
But they're probably in the ballpark.

49:52.440 --> 49:53.440
I mean, we just saw some news, what,

49:53.440 --> 49:56.560
that IBM was going with Slack and has 350,000 employees.

49:56.560 --> 49:58.600
So that's kind of the scale.

49:58.600 --> 49:59.280
Yeah, really.

49:59.280 --> 50:00.120
No kidding.

50:00.120 --> 50:01.400
All right, well, you found a talk

50:01.400 --> 50:03.160
that seemed to grab your attention called

50:03.160 --> 50:04.600
the selfish contributor.

50:04.600 --> 50:06.320
I'm going to take you on a journey

50:06.320 --> 50:09.560
through the deep, dark, motivational secrets,

50:09.560 --> 50:11.840
the seamy underbelly of open source,

50:11.840 --> 50:14.240
how people can actually get engineers

50:14.240 --> 50:17.640
to contribute efficiently to the open source project.

50:17.640 --> 50:18.600
I'm James Bottomley.

50:18.600 --> 50:22.560
I work for IBM, as you can see from my email address.

50:22.560 --> 50:25.120
I'm actually a very old school open source person.

50:25.120 --> 50:27.080
So my open source experience actually

50:27.080 --> 50:30.640
goes back to 1982 with looking at the source

50:30.640 --> 50:33.600
code of what was then BSD.

50:33.600 --> 50:37.720
So that means I've spent almost 40 years in open source.

50:37.720 --> 50:39.760
Yeah, James is also the SCSI maintainer.

50:39.760 --> 50:42.220
And he really has a long history in working with open source.

50:42.220 --> 50:44.240
In particular, has seen how, well,

50:44.240 --> 50:46.880
we like to talk about some of the altruistic motives involved

50:46.880 --> 50:47.440
in open source, right?

50:47.440 --> 50:48.720
You're helping the community.

50:48.720 --> 50:50.840
You're adding to the betterment of everyone.

50:50.840 --> 50:53.880
Really, a lot of things, open source is a shared good.

50:53.880 --> 50:56.480
But we have to acknowledge that a lot of people's actions

50:56.480 --> 50:58.280
are primarily self-interested, right?

50:58.280 --> 51:00.280
I mean, you're scratching your own itch.

51:00.280 --> 51:01.920
And he kind of acknowledges that.

51:01.920 --> 51:03.720
And you need to think about that if you

51:03.720 --> 51:06.160
want to make these projects work as well as they can.

51:06.160 --> 51:10.360
So the trap is that once you run into the scaling problem,

51:10.360 --> 51:12.320
the temptation is to flow control.

51:12.320 --> 51:13.720
I mean, you're all engineers.

51:13.720 --> 51:17.200
Everybody knows that if you've got a congestion problem,

51:17.200 --> 51:18.440
you flow control it.

51:18.440 --> 51:21.380
So the natural flow control you would think of

51:21.380 --> 51:24.920
is tap the source, push back on the contributors,

51:24.920 --> 51:26.960
try and slow down the contributions,

51:26.960 --> 51:29.480
make the pipeline flow much more evenly.

51:29.480 --> 51:31.920
And effectively, the temptation, therefore,

51:31.920 --> 51:34.440
is to try and push the problem onto the contributors,

51:34.440 --> 51:36.120
to raise barriers to contribution.

51:36.120 --> 51:36.620
Right.

51:36.620 --> 51:38.960
And that's sometimes what you see with things like IRC.

51:38.960 --> 51:41.520
Or in the kernel's case, we talked about that scaling

51:41.520 --> 51:43.320
problem with Linus.

51:43.320 --> 51:46.120
And they solved it at that level, at the maintainer level,

51:46.120 --> 51:49.560
with tooling, in particular, inventing Git and having

51:49.560 --> 51:51.000
a system with maintainers where you

51:51.000 --> 51:53.600
could have multiple trees managed and then merged

51:53.600 --> 51:55.360
together into one.

51:55.360 --> 51:57.280
And that's all kind of all about respecting

51:57.280 --> 51:58.800
your users and contributors.

51:58.800 --> 52:03.160
But conditioning contributions on mandatory unrelated actions,

52:03.160 --> 52:06.560
the quid pro quo, makes contributors feel used.

52:06.560 --> 52:08.760
You know, it feels like the project

52:08.760 --> 52:10.040
is stealing your free time.

52:10.040 --> 52:12.240
You're not giving it voluntarily because you

52:12.240 --> 52:13.520
want to get this patch upstream.

52:13.520 --> 52:14.840
Perhaps your employer has charged

52:14.840 --> 52:16.320
you to get this patch upstream.

52:16.320 --> 52:18.520
So you have to satisfy this quid pro quo

52:18.520 --> 52:19.680
to get this to happen.

52:19.680 --> 52:22.920
And it makes you feel very used and unhappy.

52:22.920 --> 52:25.960
Scaling problems must be solved in the acceptance layer.

52:25.960 --> 52:27.760
They must be solved by tooling.

52:27.760 --> 52:29.800
They must be solved by the maintainers.

52:29.800 --> 52:32.920
If you push the scaling problem down onto the contributors,

52:32.920 --> 52:35.680
you're setting your project up for failure eventually.

52:35.680 --> 52:37.800
I mean, it will chunter on for a long time.

52:37.800 --> 52:40.480
Perhaps it will be a popular project for a long time.

52:40.480 --> 52:43.200
But the moment your popularity starts

52:43.200 --> 52:45.880
to wane, as it did in the kernel a long time ago,

52:45.880 --> 52:48.000
is the moment that your contributors will

52:48.000 --> 52:50.640
start to remember all of the wrongs you've done to them

52:50.640 --> 52:53.240
and start to move off onto the trendier projects.

52:53.240 --> 52:56.280
If you want to keep a committed contributor base,

52:56.280 --> 52:57.600
you need to treat them well.

52:57.600 --> 52:59.840
Wow, this feels like we've just come full circle

52:59.840 --> 53:02.280
on a month-long conversation we've

53:02.280 --> 53:04.640
been having at the metal level on this show.

53:04.640 --> 53:05.760
That's really great.

53:05.760 --> 53:07.720
And there's so many more things.

53:07.720 --> 53:10.840
I really liked everything I grabbed.

53:10.840 --> 53:12.840
This with the server was really feeling

53:12.840 --> 53:14.200
the load on this last weekend.

53:14.200 --> 53:16.160
And it probably will be because they're still

53:16.160 --> 53:16.880
adding more videos.

53:16.880 --> 53:18.360
So people are still coming and checking.

53:18.360 --> 53:20.040
And not everything's actually like that.

53:20.040 --> 53:21.720
It's a tall order to get to them all.

53:21.720 --> 53:23.960
We'll have some of our favorites linked in the show notes.

53:23.960 --> 53:25.960
And they're definitely worth checking out, especially a

53:25.960 --> 53:28.000
couple there's been a lot of discussion lately around,

53:28.000 --> 53:30.880
do Linux distros still matter in the age of containers

53:30.880 --> 53:32.400
and Kubernetes?

53:32.400 --> 53:34.680
There's some good answers to that.

53:34.680 --> 53:36.560
Minimac has a follow-up to the IRC topic.

53:36.560 --> 53:37.640
Go ahead.

53:37.640 --> 53:40.120
I think IRC will stay forever.

53:40.120 --> 53:41.200
It's like ham radio.

53:41.200 --> 53:42.040
It will never die.

53:42.040 --> 53:44.160
And someday you'll be happy to have it.

53:44.160 --> 53:45.520
I could see that.

53:45.520 --> 53:47.760
It's very low bandwidth, number one.

53:47.760 --> 53:50.080
And the text-based nature of it means

53:50.080 --> 53:53.080
that it's always going to be advantageous for some reason.

53:53.080 --> 53:56.320
And like the conversation was continuing in the chat room,

53:56.320 --> 53:58.920
there's tools on top of IRC now that give it

53:58.920 --> 54:01.520
some of that additional image previewing or integration

54:01.520 --> 54:03.160
or those kinds of things.

54:03.160 --> 54:04.040
Your thoughts, Byte?

54:04.040 --> 54:08.680
Well, you at least need IRC for all those botnets.

54:08.680 --> 54:09.520
I do.

54:09.520 --> 54:11.920
I would hate to say goodbye to JBot, if nothing else.

54:11.920 --> 54:17.960
Now it's like, oh, yeah, JBot's like the old bot that's

54:17.960 --> 54:19.240
been around for so long now.

54:19.240 --> 54:21.480
It's the cute little broken robot that still kind of works.

54:21.480 --> 54:22.120
Yeah.

54:22.120 --> 54:24.040
It's over there running in the wall right now,

54:24.040 --> 54:26.440
but it's still grabbing title suggestions, which we are not

54:26.440 --> 54:27.840
getting enough of.

54:27.840 --> 54:29.320
Chat room.

54:29.320 --> 54:30.800
I will shut that IRC down.

54:30.800 --> 54:33.720
For shame.

54:33.720 --> 54:36.480
Well, Carl, any other kind of closing notes

54:36.480 --> 54:38.560
or anything else you want to touch on about FOSDEM?

54:38.560 --> 54:41.240
This is your moment to be our reporter on the scene.

54:41.240 --> 54:42.920
I don't know if there's anything that you felt like maybe

54:42.920 --> 54:44.560
we're missing in our chat here.

54:44.560 --> 54:46.960
Did you see the picture that I posted about kind

54:46.960 --> 54:48.240
of the summary of FOSDEM?

54:48.240 --> 54:49.520
I don't know if I did.

54:49.520 --> 54:51.760
If you go to FOSDEM's Wikipedia page,

54:51.760 --> 54:54.480
the main picture on there besides the logo

54:54.480 --> 54:57.120
is just one of the rooms with a full sign on it.

54:57.120 --> 55:00.360
They are very strict about fire code and things like that

55:00.360 --> 55:04.160
there, and so it's off-putting to a lot of people.

55:04.160 --> 55:06.680
This was my first one, but after going,

55:06.680 --> 55:08.040
I heard a lot of people complaining

55:08.040 --> 55:10.440
about how they couldn't get into any of the talks they wanted

55:10.440 --> 55:11.440
to.

55:11.440 --> 55:14.000
I mentioned the dev rooms where you just kind of had

55:14.000 --> 55:16.480
to camp out all day long, and you wouldn't get your seat back

55:16.480 --> 55:18.600
if you even went to the bathroom.

55:18.600 --> 55:20.920
It can be a little off-putting, but I don't really

55:20.920 --> 55:23.520
know how they would solve that when you have that many people

55:23.520 --> 55:24.400
interested in going.

55:24.400 --> 55:27.120
You don't want to just tell them not to come.

55:27.120 --> 55:29.380
One of their big appeals is that they

55:29.380 --> 55:30.840
don't require any registration.

55:30.840 --> 55:33.080
It's also free, as in money.

55:33.080 --> 55:35.800
It doesn't cost anything, and they just

55:35.800 --> 55:37.160
have so much attendance that they

55:37.160 --> 55:39.120
have a lot of logistical problems around it.

55:39.120 --> 55:40.080
Yeah.

55:40.080 --> 55:42.800
That is a tricky balance.

55:42.800 --> 55:45.040
I have tried to get into a talk and been told, nope,

55:45.040 --> 55:47.920
room's full, and they've had to say it 100 times,

55:47.920 --> 55:50.200
so they're kind of not very rough with it.

55:50.200 --> 55:51.400
Yeah, that's the way to put it.

55:51.400 --> 55:52.360
Not patient.

55:52.360 --> 55:53.120
Yeah.

55:53.120 --> 55:55.080
It definitely is part of what makes it great,

55:55.080 --> 55:59.000
but also part of what makes it not so great.

55:59.000 --> 56:02.640
Maybe they could think about how to scale that a little better.

56:02.640 --> 56:03.480
Not sure.

56:03.480 --> 56:07.080
Yeah, the Texas Cyber Summit that we went to, I think,

56:07.080 --> 56:10.960
was doing live streams at the event over a Wi-Fi network

56:10.960 --> 56:11.480
or something.

56:11.480 --> 56:12.080
Do you recall that?

56:12.080 --> 56:13.520
They had a way to tune into rooms

56:13.520 --> 56:14.680
that you weren't in for a lot of them.

56:14.680 --> 56:16.440
Oh, yeah, that was pretty convenient.

56:16.440 --> 56:18.800
And I don't know how much of that made it public,

56:18.800 --> 56:21.840
but they had a resource for goers

56:21.840 --> 56:23.520
that wanted to tune into it.

56:23.520 --> 56:25.840
But you don't go and travel all that way

56:25.840 --> 56:27.920
to get an audio feed with bad mic audio,

56:27.920 --> 56:30.200
because I mean, this mic audio, that's

56:30.200 --> 56:31.520
even after we've cleaned it up.

56:31.520 --> 56:32.960
We're cleaning it up and fixing their audio,

56:32.960 --> 56:33.960
and it still doesn't sound great.

56:33.960 --> 56:35.840
It's never quite like being in the room.

56:35.840 --> 56:38.000
It's really, yeah, it really is what it's about.

56:38.000 --> 56:39.960
Lots of people there, FOSDEM, they just completely

56:39.960 --> 56:42.400
ignore the sessions, just focus on the hallway track

56:42.400 --> 56:44.080
and face-to-face time with people,

56:44.080 --> 56:47.000
because FOSDEM's so good about their video recordings.

56:47.000 --> 56:48.560
That's what it is, man.

56:48.560 --> 56:49.560
It really is.

56:49.560 --> 56:52.040
After all, people used to say, oh, it's

56:52.040 --> 56:53.400
all about the hallway track, and I thought,

56:53.400 --> 56:54.680
that's a waste of money.

56:54.680 --> 56:56.560
You are irresponsible.

56:56.560 --> 56:58.840
You should be taking advantage of that time and learning.

56:58.840 --> 57:01.000
And not that that isn't part of going,

57:01.000 --> 57:05.080
but now here I am, like, 10 years into that plus,

57:05.080 --> 57:07.360
and it's like, oh, you know what really is the best part is

57:07.360 --> 57:08.720
seeing people catching up, talking

57:08.720 --> 57:10.840
about what they're doing, problems they're solving.

57:10.840 --> 57:12.840
It's really way more valuable than you realize.

57:12.840 --> 57:14.280
That's the community right there.

57:14.280 --> 57:16.120
I really like having a mix.

57:16.120 --> 57:18.600
The hallway track's great in getting to talk to people,

57:18.600 --> 57:20.720
but also there are some talks that, hey,

57:20.720 --> 57:23.800
I want to see that live, like right now, and ask questions.

57:23.800 --> 57:27.200
And it's just off-putting not being able to get into a room.

57:27.200 --> 57:28.280
Yeah.

57:28.280 --> 57:29.640
I still think we're going to have

57:29.640 --> 57:32.000
to find our way over there sooner rather than later.

57:32.000 --> 57:33.080
I know.

57:33.080 --> 57:34.200
I know.

57:34.200 --> 57:36.640
Yeah, although I kind of like, like,

57:36.640 --> 57:39.920
Linux Fest Northwest is about as big as I like.

57:39.920 --> 57:43.080
Scale is a little too much for me.

57:43.080 --> 57:46.000
And Texas Linux Fest is the perfect size for me,

57:46.000 --> 57:48.040
but I think it could also grow a bit.

57:48.040 --> 57:51.160
But there's a different, there's like a sort

57:51.160 --> 57:52.840
of a diminishing return on results

57:52.840 --> 57:54.040
when it starts getting too big.

57:54.040 --> 57:56.720
Right, and it becomes a little more chaotic and a little less

57:56.720 --> 57:58.080
sort of community feel.

57:58.080 --> 57:59.480
Could you imagine like another couple thousand

57:59.480 --> 58:00.640
at Linux Fest Northwest?

58:00.640 --> 58:01.160
That'd be tight.

58:01.160 --> 58:01.920
It'd be a lot.

58:01.920 --> 58:02.480
It'd be a lot.

58:02.480 --> 58:04.600
It's a nice campus, but it'd be a lot.

58:04.600 --> 58:07.480
OK, well, do check out the resources for FOSDEM.

58:07.480 --> 58:10.040
There's a lot to dig into, and it's still pretty neat

58:10.040 --> 58:13.280
to see a community-funded event like this going strong now

58:13.280 --> 58:15.000
for 20 years.

58:15.000 --> 58:16.360
And you're right, Wes.

58:16.360 --> 58:17.720
We do need to make it over there.

58:17.720 --> 58:19.080
All right, some picks?

58:19.080 --> 58:19.920
Of course.

58:19.920 --> 58:21.760
All right, before we exit this week,

58:21.760 --> 58:24.480
I want to follow up on something we just sort of tossed out

58:24.480 --> 58:24.960
recently.

58:24.960 --> 58:28.560
We said, there's that really cool thing

58:28.560 --> 58:30.120
you can run on the terminal that makes

58:30.120 --> 58:32.520
it look like you're doing a bunch of really cool hacker

58:32.520 --> 58:33.440
work.

58:33.440 --> 58:35.160
And yeah, we figured it out.

58:35.160 --> 58:38.880
It's called Hollywood, and it's available as a snap.

58:38.880 --> 58:40.520
Created by Dustin Kirkland.

58:40.520 --> 58:42.400
Yeah, yeah, and he's also published it

58:42.400 --> 58:43.880
as a Docker container.

58:43.880 --> 58:46.760
Oh, he can just go get it off of GitHub.

58:46.760 --> 58:49.560
It's the perfect thing to put up in a terminal window

58:49.560 --> 58:50.960
and put on a virtual desktop.

58:50.960 --> 58:52.840
And then anytime you need to look like you're

58:52.840 --> 58:55.280
working on something that's unbelievable that only Linux

58:55.280 --> 58:56.740
could do, you flip over to that.

58:56.740 --> 59:01.760
He calls it Hollywood because it is quintessential kind

59:01.760 --> 59:04.040
of Hollywood crazy stuff going on your screen that looks

59:04.040 --> 59:06.200
like hacker-type activities.

59:06.200 --> 59:07.820
And I love it.

59:07.820 --> 59:08.520
I love it a lot.

59:08.520 --> 59:11.240
And he was tweeting Elon Musk last week.

59:11.240 --> 59:12.920
This is how I came across it again.

59:12.920 --> 59:14.720
He was tweeting Elon Musk, encouraging

59:14.720 --> 59:17.480
him to integrate it into the Tesla screens.

59:17.480 --> 59:20.880
Wouldn't that be amazing?

59:20.880 --> 59:21.960
And I'm like, yes.

59:21.960 --> 59:22.840
And it's running Linux, right?

59:22.840 --> 59:23.680
Isn't that thing running Linux?

59:23.680 --> 59:24.560
Of course.

59:24.560 --> 59:26.120
So I think you should get in on that.

59:26.120 --> 59:27.320
It really is impressive, too.

59:27.320 --> 59:29.180
I mean, they put in some time into work

59:29.180 --> 59:32.480
to get a diverse array of different technical information

59:32.480 --> 59:35.480
with all the fancy Unicode you could want.

59:35.480 --> 59:36.760
It's so great.

59:36.760 --> 59:39.600
And it pulls in a few bits, like your user name and stuff.

59:39.600 --> 59:41.920
So you can see a few things in there

59:41.920 --> 59:44.160
that look kind of legitimate going by.

59:44.160 --> 59:46.800
And then this one has been on our Get To list

59:46.800 --> 59:49.680
for a long time, in fact, so long that I haven't tried it

59:49.680 --> 59:50.920
recently.

59:50.920 --> 59:51.760
Is that a word, Wes?

59:51.760 --> 59:52.800
No.

59:52.800 --> 59:54.800
It's recently.

59:54.800 --> 59:55.720
You're close, though.

59:55.720 --> 59:57.000
So close, Wes.

59:57.000 --> 59:58.440
It's called SharePoint Sync.

59:58.440 --> 01:00:01.080
And it's an AirPlay audio receiver.

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:03.520
So if you got yourself a receiver.

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:05.680
I was confused by that at first.

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:07.800
What's the problem?

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:09.040
You explain it.

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.600
Well, here's your use case scenario.

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:11.280
But there's lots.

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:13.320
I mean, you could toss this thing on an old Pyskys,

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:15.020
hook it up to a speaker, and then you just

01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:16.520
got yourself a $50 home button.

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:17.040
You know what I'm saying?

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:17.560
There we go.

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:19.960
But here's the more practical use case.

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:22.200
Say you got yourself one of those iOS devices, which

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.880
I know you don't, but let's just say you did.

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:24.560
Sure, sure.

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:26.640
There is a scenario that those of us

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:29.400
who are listening to a podcast on the road run into when

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:30.640
we get to work and we want to continue

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:32.260
listening on our desktop speakers, where

01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:35.840
we got nicer speakers, you want to keep listening.

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:37.840
So what you can do now is you get out of the car.

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:39.080
You walk into the old office.

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:40.080
You sit down at the old desk.

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:41.800
You've got this running on your machine.

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:43.040
You can hit this button.

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:45.660
Your Linux box starts receiving the audio from your phone

01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:47.160
and starts playing it over your desktop speakers.

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:48.280
You finish off the podcast.

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:50.680
So that is neat.

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:52.400
That's why I wanted it.

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:53.200
That's why I got it.

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:56.360
I kind of like you capturing from that proprietary world

01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:58.440
and playing with it right there in Linux.

01:00:58.440 --> 01:00:59.920
And once you get it in Linux, you think about it.

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:02.080
You could probably capture the audio pretty easily.

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:03.240
You could do anything with it.

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:04.440
So it's called SharePoint Sync.

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:09.040
I don't know why they call it Microsoft's intranet name

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:09.560
thing.

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:10.920
SharePort.

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:11.960
Oh, thanks.

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:13.400
What is the matter with me?

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:15.760
It's like once it's in the old noggin,

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:17.760
once my peepers read it one way and put store it

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:21.040
in the old noggin, that's just how it comes out.

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:22.720
SharePoint wouldn't make any sense.

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:24.000
That's the Microsoft thing.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.320
That would be a dumb name for a product like this.

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:28.720
Although I'll be honest with you, SharePort, not much better.

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:29.880
But you get the idea.

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:31.040
Looks like a great project.

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:31.640
Yeah.

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:34.520
And it's supposedly, suppose, supposedly,

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:38.440
suppose to synchronize with the AirPlay video tracking.

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:41.200
So if you're watching a video on your internet phone,

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:43.720
it'll be in sync with the audio coming out of the speakers.

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:45.120
That is impressive.

01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:45.800
Yeah.

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:49.640
And he has gone to extra care, as he puts it,

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:53.800
to work well with Pulse Audio on desktop Linuxes.

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:56.280
That's neat too, just like having your iOS device

01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:57.480
show up right in Pulse.

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.000
Yeah.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:58.520
Awesome.

01:01:58.520 --> 01:01:59.360
Kodi does it too.

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:00.360
Kodi, it works in Kodi.

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:01.880
Kodi, you can go into Kodi and turn this on.

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:04.120
They're doing their own thing to make this possible.

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:07.000
So you can also do it to like a TV hooked up

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.720
to like some nice speakers with the old Kodi.

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:10.600
That'll work as well.

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:13.400
Turns out a lot of Linux users also have iPhones.

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:14.600
Well, maybe.

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:16.080
Maybe, or maybe it's just me.

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:17.440
But now I'm just open about it.

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:20.240
You know, I used to be ashamed, but yeah.

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:21.560
Ain't nothing wrong with that.

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:23.440
Oh, I think they're both great, honestly.

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:26.080
I mean, the truth of the matter is I have a Pixel as well.

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:27.120
And a PinePhone now.

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:29.520
Yeah, and an iPhone.

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:32.680
God, what is the matter with me?

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:33.520
This is ridiculous.

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:35.440
We've got to get out of here.

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:37.360
I need to go do some reflecting on all of this.

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:38.800
Maybe stop by the pawn shop.

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:41.200
We need some more SIM cards.

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:42.840
Actually, I did get a SIM card in.

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:43.840
Got a Ting SIM card.

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:44.360
Ting.

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:45.720
Tell us a little more about Ting.

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:48.120
You know, if you go to last.ting.com.

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.560
I wonder if it's still there.

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:50.200
I don't know.

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:51.360
But you get $25.

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:55.000
And listen, most Ting bills are around $23 or $24 a month

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:55.520
there, cheese.

01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:57.920
So you can pay for your first month.

01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:00.320
All right, well listen, we're getting out of here.

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:01.360
Be sure to tune in live.

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:02.160
It's a lot of fun.

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:03.360
It's a huge mumble room.

01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:05.520
You can get information if you just Google search for Jupiter

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:06.160
colony mumble.

01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:08.560
The show is live on Tuesdays, jupiterbroadcasting.com,

01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:10.440
so that's calendar in your local time zone.

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:12.240
And we'll see you back here next Tuesday.

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:42.200
Hey!

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:54.560
JBtitles.com. Everybody go vote. We got to get our titles in. JBtitles, JBtitles.com.

01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:55.560
Everyone go.

01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:56.560
We literally can't do it without you.

01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:59.800
Go vote. And also, I just want to take a second again and say, Dusty, I've been wanting you

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:05.760
to join us forever. So I'm really glad that Carl twisted your arm and got you to do it.

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:06.760
You work with CoreOS, right?

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:07.760
Yep, that's right.

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:09.240
What do you do with CoreOS?

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:14.640
It hasn't changed a whole lot since the last time I interviewed with you, but mostly helping

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:20.040
do the engineering side of things with Fedora CoreOS and also a little bit of community

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:21.040
stewardship there.

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:26.000
Okay, all right. So help me understand. So when you say this, really, it's Fedora CoreOS

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.260
you work on now, not CoreOS anymore. So that's where I'm confused. So you're not actually

01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:35.000
maintaining or are you maintaining both of them? Are you doing that until September?

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.520
What is the situation there?

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:46.080
Yeah. So within our teams, we try to separate out the terminology a little bit. So for example,

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:54.080
if you talk about the old offering from CoreOS Inc., we call that Container Linux because

01:04:54.080 --> 01:05:01.160
they renamed it, I guess, a while back before any Red Hat acquisition or anything like that.

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:08.040
So it's called Container Linux. And then if you're talking about some of the new offerings,

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:14.280
we either call it Fedora CoreOS or there's the enterprise offering that OpenShift runs

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:21.140
on top of that's called a RHEL CoreOS or some people call it Red Hat CoreOS.

01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:28.760
And so if somebody says CoreOS, they're referring to RHEL CoreOS, which works with OpenShift?

01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:32.360
When somebody says CoreOS, we have to ask them what they really mean.

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:35.840
That's what I was trying to get to about you.

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:38.240
He's not going to give you a clear answer on purpose.

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:48.200
Yeah. So I primarily work on Fedora CoreOS that feeds into the Red Hat CoreOS piece that

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:54.680
OpenShift runs on top of. So I do work there as well anytime bugs need to be fixed or whatnot,

01:05:54.680 --> 01:06:00.580
I participate in those duties. But as far as Container Linux goes, I don't personally

01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:07.200
touch that as much just because the team of people who were doing that already had a lot

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:12.640
of the knowledge. We did some cross pollination there. We have had some of our new team members

01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:18.000
run some of those processes to do releases and stuff, but we don't touch them as much

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.680
as the people who were responsible for them before the acquisition.

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:33.000
So you were on in 2018 around June. So how much has your role shifted since? I mean,

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.280
that's quite a while ago now, a year and a half. How much have things shifted for you

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:37.800
for your day-to-day roles?

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:46.000
It's mostly the same. We've had a lot of work that we've done in the community, just taking

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:51.760
the two projects, the Atomic Host project and the Container Linux projects and putting

01:06:51.760 --> 01:07:00.660
them together has been quite a lot of work. Just mainly because Container Linux, the model

01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:10.000
there with the streams is pretty different than what Fedora is typically built on today.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:16.960
So with Fedora, we have rawhide, we have updates testing, we have updates. And that model is

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:22.960
a little bit different than what Container Linux had with the alpha, beta stable.

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:30.400
And so what we've tried to do is mold the Fedora model a little bit to get a stable

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:36.760
and testing stream as well as something that we're calling Next, which is not quite what

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:44.680
alpha was for Container Linux, but we'll more closely follow what rawhide is, or what the

01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:48.880
branch next release is for Fedora Core OS.

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:54.440
So we've kind of gone through a lot of like, oh, evaluate what Container Linux was, their

01:07:54.440 --> 01:08:00.720
release processes, their guarantees to the community, the technology underneath, evaluate

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:06.880
what Atomic Host was, its relationship to Fedora, what kind of community we had, what

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:11.820
are the things we wanted to support, what are the things we didn't want to support.

01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:18.760
And it's just been a very large effort to resolve all of those things, and then put

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:24.280
it all together and start to build steam, start to do releases every two weeks, and

01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:28.560
start to exercise those release processes that we've recently defined.

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:36.000
Wow, no kidding. Do you have a rough sense of the size of the Container Linux user base?

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.600
Is it hundreds of thousands? I mean, do you have a rough ballpark number? I was looking

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:45.000
at the transition plan and it looks like there's flat car for them if they want something that's

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:49.940
a direct migration, but it looks like there's not a perfect solution for all particular

01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:57.000
use cases. And I wonder if this is like, are we talking like, is this a ginormous market

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.400
disruption or is this going to impact a few thousand people? Like what's the ballpark

01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:01.400
figure there?

01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:09.760
Yeah, so I don't know exact numbers there. You know, it's definitely not less than 10,000

01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:18.200
and it's not, it's not a million either, right? But, you know, they had some, I guess, data

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:24.240
on how many users were checking in on a daily basis. And then they also got data from different

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:29.720
cloud providers letting them know, all right, here's how many instances were spun up, you

01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:38.640
know, in a given month or whatnot. And, you know, I'm not sure how reliable, you know,

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:46.080
the numbers that I know about are, but it's not a small market and it's not a huge market

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:51.280
either. It's somewhere in between. But what we've tried to do is communicate from the

01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:57.520
beginning about differences that are going to happen with, you know, the migration from

01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:04.600
what container Linux was and give people enough information from the beginning to be able

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:11.280
to, you know, make decisions for what they need to do in the future. Fedora Core OS has

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:16.680
had a preview came out in July of last year. So we've been taking feedback from community

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:23.380
members, you know, ever since that came out and really trying to, you know, not just drop

01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:29.820
anybody right on their face. But luckily flat card does exist as well. So we had a guy come

01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:35.280
in earlier today and was like, Hey, can I migrate from container Linux? And unfortunately

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:39.800
the answer is no, because it's a completely different model, right? We, we, our updates

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:45.520
aren't based on a block device is based on a file system, right? So the answer is no,

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:50.480
he can't directly upgrade his existing container Linux node to Fedora Core OS.

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:54.160
You could probably move the container workloads though, if you set up a new host.

01:10:54.160 --> 01:11:03.200
Exactly. Yeah. Part of the idea behind container Linux itself was that you essentially define

01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:10.480
how that node is going to be started and provisioned using Ignition from the beginning, right?

01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:16.600
And so if you define everything about that node in this one, you know, Ignition config,

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:21.580
which is JSON, then you should be able to take that Ignition config to any number of

01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:27.280
nodes and just spawn them off, you know, just start them up, right? Um, so the idea there

01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:31.880
is that you encode everything that's needed for this node to know what it needs to do

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:38.440
in life, um, in that config. And then it's really easy to start new nodes, right? So

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:45.080
the idea there is, uh, you know, migration, as long as they have a configuration file

01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:49.720
that defines what that node's life is, or view of the world is, uh, is not that big

01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:56.000
of a deal because honestly, um, you know, spawning new instances should be kind of

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:02.280
normal day-to-day stuff in, in our, um, you know, more cloud native world, right? There's

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:06.820
existing bare metal instances that kind of don't live by that model, but we're trying

01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:12.880
to get people more to that model. Um, and so unfortunately for this guy, his case was

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:18.520
that he was in a different state than where his server was, and he also didn't have any

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:24.900
sort of lights out management for that server. So fortunately for people like that, um, there

01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:31.240
is flat car, right? So, you know, we're actually appreciative of that project existing for

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:37.680
people to have somewhere to go if they really can't migrate to Fedora Coral West. But, um,

01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:42.080
you know, that's just an example of a community spawning up where a need exists, right?

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:46.880
I love that. Um, well, I'm glad you're able to stop by and update us. I encourage you

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:52.520
to join us anytime you have the time and I'll leave you, uh, with a bit of advice. If Carl

01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:56.420
ever tells you something's good eats, you trust that man at his word. He knows good

01:12:56.420 --> 01:12:57.420
food.

01:12:57.420 --> 01:13:18.520
That's all the time we have for today's episode of Fedora Coral West. We'll see you next time.
