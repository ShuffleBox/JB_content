1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,360
This is great for us now that we're really an audio show.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,080
There's a pair of sunglasses out there

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,080
that would have made a great sponsor back in the day

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,040
when we had sponsors.

5
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,480
They block out all of the screens around you.

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,000
And it's not actually all of that tricky.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,800
There is a company out there called

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,500
Casper that makes not the mattress company.

9
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,400
I guess it's a different company that

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,100
makes a screen blocking film.

11
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,080
And one entrepreneur with a last name of Blow, I think,

12
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,120
or Blue, I can't remember his last name,

13
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,200
he popped out the lenses in these cheap old sunglasses,

14
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,960
put a pair on with this film over it,

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,280
and then set off into the city and realized

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,680
that he was blocking all of the televisions around him.

17
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,800
All the annoying signs that use TVs,

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,800
all the TVs in the bar that you're going to,

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,880
and you don't care about that sports game on there.

20
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,180
You don't have to see it anymore.

21
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,400
So his name is Blue, B-L-E-W.

22
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,280
And they're the IRL glasses.

23
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,020
Yeah, they've even formed a company and, you guessed it,

24
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,240
a Kickstarter.

25
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,400
They've got a Kickstarter.

26
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,200
Wow, they've raised $5,000 since we went on the air.

27
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,160
That's not bad.

28
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,400
When I first loaded this page about a half hour ago,

29
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,760
they were at $75,000.

30
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,280
Now they're at $80,000 with 1,207 backers

31
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,560
with 21 days left to go.

32
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,760
You can see everything except screens, they say.

33
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,180
Yeah, I guess, actually, anything

34
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,300
that is just a polarized lens rotated 90 degrees

35
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,280
and then flattened can produce the same effect.

36
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,260
You don't actually need this one company's special film.

37
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,920
So you can go play with this right now.

38
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,600
And it won't block OLED screens.

39
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,120
If you ever try to lie on a sun lounger

40
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,280
and read your phone with sunglasses on,

41
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,200
sometimes you get the same thing.

42
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,960
Have you ever gone swimming with polarized sunglasses on?

43
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,840
It's pretty cool.

44
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,680
This is one of those kinds of things that I wouldn't mind,

45
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,080
but you'd have to bring a pair for everybody.

46
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,720
You go sit down at a restaurant and you're

47
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,640
wearing these sunglasses, it'd be distracting

48
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,320
for everybody at the table.

49
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,800
They get used to it just a couple times.

50
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,520
Oh, that's that weird thing Chris does.

51
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,680
Now you've got to bring a pair for everybody.

52
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:19,880
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 270 for October 9, 2018.

53
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,440
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

54
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,200
that's drying the tears of those G Plus users.

55
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:25,960
My name is Chris.

56
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,640
My name is Wes.

57
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,040
Hello, Wes.

58
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,480
We do have some Google news to get into today, but not too

59
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:31,960
much.

60
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,480
We won't overwhelm me because then we

61
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,800
have some big Plasma desktop news, some upcoming GNOME

62
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,440
announcements, as well as a bit of a GNOME history lesson.

63
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,440
We're going to go back to the good old days

64
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,420
when Linux on the desktop wasn't a joke, it was the hype.

65
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,080
And it's actually where that saying,

66
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,540
the year of Linux desktop came from.

67
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,640
We're going to go back to that era

68
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,280
and look at some fascinating times that

69
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,080
resulted in software that we're still using today,

70
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,640
but you might not know its heritage.

71
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,520
We'll dig into that.

72
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,720
Then later on the show, we've made no secret about it.

73
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,840
We are big fans of Red Hat's Project Stratus.

74
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,840
It's a tool, or a layer really, that's

75
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,080
bringing a bunch of existing technologies

76
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,960
together on Linux to compete with CFS

77
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,160
and offer some of the same feature sets as ButterFS,

78
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,200
but using established technologies like XFS,

79
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,800
the DM layer of the Linux kernel,

80
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,440
some of the same exact tools that LVM uses today.

81
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,040
And Andy is one of the lead developers

82
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,800
behind Project Stratus, and he's going

83
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,720
to come on and give us the high level pitch of what it does,

84
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,000
what it is, and then answer some of our questions that

85
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,400
get down into the weeds.

86
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,760
And after that, I'm getting organized,

87
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,600
and I am using this week's app pick to do it.

88
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,400
I'll share the app pick for you that I'm

89
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,880
using to get my life in order, for goodness sake.

90
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,300
But before we go any further, we've

91
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,480
got to bring in that virtual lug time appropriate.

92
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,160
Greetings, Mumble Room.

93
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,040
Good evening, morning, greetings, wake up, and smell.

94
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,640
Howdy, y'all.

95
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,600
Love it.

96
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,760
Hello, Mr. Badger, Mini Mac, Popey, Sean, Spazzy C,

97
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,320
and Wimpy.

98
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,240
It is good to have you in the virtual lug today.

99
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,560
Let's just get the elephant out of the room.

100
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,880
Big story this week.

101
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,680
Google Plus is shutting down in the wake of a bit of a data

102
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,540
leak, and maybe the bigger part of the story

103
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,320
is that Google tried to keep it under wraps.

104
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,040
And we're learning about this from a Wall Street Journal

105
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,200
report that got memos from within Google.

106
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,760
And the really damning stuff about this

107
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,740
is these memos make it clear that leadership,

108
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,760
such as the chief executive, Sunder Pichai,

109
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:43,280
was briefed on the plan not to notify users, which

110
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,360
he signed off on.

111
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,720
This is a huge story, and it seems

112
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,880
that there was a, quote, glitch in an API for Google Plus

113
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,600
between 2015 and March of 2018 when an internal Google

114
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,800
investigation discovered and then immediately attempted

115
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,760
to fix the issue.

116
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,200
This is one of the reasons why they didn't

117
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,280
make a disclosure about it.

118
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,560
It wasn't that somebody came to them and then got a bug bounty.

119
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,160
It was that Google found this during its own internal audit,

120
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,580
which is commendable in some ways.

121
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,320
The memo reviewed by the journal prepared by Google's legal

122
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,880
and policy staff and then shared with senior executives

123
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,100
warned that disclosing the incident

124
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,640
would likely trigger immediate regulatory interest

125
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,080
and invite comparisons to Facebook's leak of user

126
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,600
information from Cambridge Analytica.

127
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,480
They did have some considerations, though.

128
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,760
So whether we could accurately identify the users to inform,

129
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,260
whether there was any actual evidence of misuse,

130
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,920
and whether there were any actions a developer or user

131
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,440
could actually take in response, they didn't find those.

132
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,120
And that was one of the reasons they gave for not telling us.

133
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,800
Which is kind of understandable.

134
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,760
They believe it was never abused by any third party

135
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,800
application.

136
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,200
It is sort of a gray area.

137
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,840
I mean, it is our data, and I would

138
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,500
like to know about what happens with it

139
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,040
and how well protected it is.

140
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,360
But are we really entitled to that?

141
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,320
It seems like for the benefit of the industry, it's good.

142
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,100
You know, it's good to be clear about this stuff.

143
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,080
The way Google handled this announcement, I think,

144
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,460
is a lesson in brilliant marketing.

145
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,760
I don't like it, but boy, did they nail the messaging on this.

146
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,400
So instead of coming out and being like,

147
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,160
yeah, not only do we have a vulnerability,

148
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,040
and not only are we shutting down Google+,

149
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,800
and not only do we try to cover it all up,

150
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,400
they take a totally different approach.

151
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,620
Instead, they launched Project Strobe,

152
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,500
protecting your data, improving third party APIs,

153
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,760
and sunsetting consumer Google+.

154
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,040
So they announced this buzzword project, Project Strobe,

155
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,680
that talks about auditing third party APIs

156
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,680
and clamping down on Gmail access.

157
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,820
And then, as almost to make their case,

158
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,000
even though Google, up until this point,

159
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,640
had claimed that it was a platform, Google+,

160
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,800
they cared very, very deeply about,

161
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,160
now they actually use its failure as an excuse to move on.

162
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,920
They say the consumer version of Google+,

163
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,680
currently has low usage and engagement.

164
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,880
Get ready for this one.

165
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,880
90% of Google+, user sessions are less than five seconds.

166
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,840
That sounds like, oh, I clicked on a Google+, link,

167
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,680
get out of here.

168
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,760
That's exactly what it sounds like.

169
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,320
So here's what was leaked, or potentially leaked.

170
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,420
Here's what was capable of being leaked

171
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,160
if third parties took advantage of this API flaw,

172
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,320
which we don't know if that actually happened.

173
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,720
It appears that the data is limited

174
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,580
to static optional Google+, profile fields,

175
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,220
which would include your name, email address,

176
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,920
your occupation, your gender, and your age.

177
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,400
It doesn't include other data from Google+,

178
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,280
or other Google services, like your Gmail,

179
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,260
or any G Suite content.

180
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,500
They say when they discovered it,

181
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,700
they believe that it was a result

182
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,160
of subsequent Google+, code changes

183
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,280
that caused interaction with the APIs

184
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,040
that led this to be possible.

185
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,000
So they probably just didn't have that many people

186
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,120
doing very much good work on Google+, anymore,

187
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,920
and some botched update.

188
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,400
They mention that the review did highlight

189
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,840
the significant challenges in creating and maintaining

190
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,440
a successful Google+, that meets consumers' expectations,

191
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,920
and given these challenges and the very low usage

192
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,320
of the consumer version of Google+,

193
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,760
we've decided to sunset the consumer version of Google+.

194
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,040
Well, Chris, where are you going?

195
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,680
What else is there?

196
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,200
I stopped using Google+, a long time ago,

197
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,800
but the reason why I wanted to include this on the show

198
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,760
is the people I have noticed that are still using it

199
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,600
are people from the open source community.

200
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,720
There are people.

201
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,400
That's all that's left, from what I can tell.

202
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:38,400
It's photographers, Mike What's-His-Face,

203
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,840
that used to be on Twitter.

204
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,660
Elgin.

205
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,400
Yeah, Elgin, Mike Elgin, and Alan Cox,

206
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,440
and other open source users.

207
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,000
Linus used to host there.

208
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,840
That's who's left on Google+, right?

209
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,640
Well, there's also a whole bunch of communities,

210
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,520
innovative commerce communities, that they call.

211
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,400
The Ubuntu one is one of the largest on Google+.

212
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,280
It's got 288,000 people in it.

213
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,040
It's pretty huge.

214
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,720
Unfortunately, every post in there nowadays

215
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,280
has a lot of spam in the comments,

216
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,920
because Google clearly haven't cared enough

217
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,200
to clear that stuff up.

218
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,200
And if I go in there and have a look at the admin interface,

219
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,800
it's just like constant spam all the time.

220
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,000
It's been a really mixed message from the very beginning.

221
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,800
They say they're going to implement this wind down

222
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,480
over a 10-month period, slated for the completion

223
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,520
by the end of next August.

224
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,400
10 months is a weird timeframe.

225
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,960
Looking at my G Plus feed today,

226
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,960
it's full of people saying, you can now find me here.

227
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:37,760
People choosing where they're going to go instead of G+.

228
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,040
And a lot of times, it seems to be Mastodon.

229
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,000
And Diaspora seems to be getting a little bit of resurgence

230
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,200
here and there as well.

231
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,200
I'd say the one I've seen the most actually is Twitter.

232
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,520
But the second one I've seen the most is Mastodon.

233
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,600
Seems to be a good moment for Mastodon.

234
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,200
Now, if Mastodon steps up and produces something,

235
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,720
or continues to produce something

236
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,680
that people find compelling, they

237
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,640
may have an opening now, although I've

238
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,080
thought from the day they launched it,

239
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,000
there just wasn't a lot of room for a third social network,

240
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,560
at least not here in the States.

241
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,760
The States is a Coke and Pepsi country, right left.

242
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,920
We seem to get two brands, and then we're good.

243
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,920
We got Twitter and Facebook.

244
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,320
Three is confusing, Preston.

245
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,200
Then you got the Instagrams, and you got the WhatsApp.

246
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,120
It's just too much.

247
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,360
There was no room for Google+, and it's silly circles.

248
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,280
There just wasn't any room for it.

249
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,480
That's why they had to cram it into YouTube

250
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,520
to try to force usage.

251
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,480
But that didn't really work out too well either.

252
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,800
You know, the real tell there was

253
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,200
that Google's own executives stopped posting to Google+,

254
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,920
and started posting to Twitter about three years ago.

255
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,640
Seriously, as soon as I noticed that, I'm like, ah.

256
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,400
They don't believe it.

257
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,000
Not dog food.

258
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Yeah, yeah, that's not good.

259
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,720
But as much as I seem flippant about it,

260
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,960
for those of you who got value out of it,

261
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,400
which is probably someone in our audience,

262
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,240
I'm sorry about your loss.

263
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,280
It's just one of those dangers of these closed services.

264
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,200
If this had happened two years ago,

265
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,760
I would have been beside myself.

266
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,320
But it's been waning for a while, and certainly

267
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,920
since Mastodon sort of caught people's attention

268
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,960
about a year ago, or people within the open source

269
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,720
community about a year ago.

270
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,720
It's very active over on Mastodon now,

271
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,320
and I think that I've been posting there

272
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,920
where I haven't been posting on G+.

273
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,240
for a while now.

274
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,440
I've resisted Mastodon just because I'm over.

275
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,840
I don't particularly like social media.

276
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,880
I like chatting with audience people,

277
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,080
so that's why I'm on there.

278
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,600
And I like tweeting back and forth with audience members.

279
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,560
But the rest of the people that are on social media,

280
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,440
I generally find them to be obnoxious.

281
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,280
I don't know, I don't like any of it.

282
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,360
I generally am not a big fan of group think.

283
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,040
So when everybody starts freaking out

284
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,000
about the same thing, I immediately kind of pull back

285
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,280
and go, oh, what's going on here?

286
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,360
And that's totally common.

287
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,440
The mob mentality is super common on social media.

288
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,720
And I'm not into it.

289
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,560
It bums me out.

290
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,120
So I've pulled back a lot.

291
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,760
I mostly just go for the list that I have now on Twitter

292
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,920
where I can follow my friends.

293
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,440
And my ad replies, and so I can reply to audience members.

294
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,920
Have you seen in England this week,

295
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,000
there's been a program called The Circle?

296
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,640
And my wife's been going crazy about it.

297
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,520
It's a social media quote unquote experiment

298
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,280
where they take, it's like Big Brother sort of,

299
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,560
where they lock some people up in an apartment complex,

300
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,600
and they use nothing but social media to communicate.

301
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,640
It's really fascinating.

302
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,880
They've had men pretending to be girls,

303
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,840
and girls pretending to be men, and straight people

304
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,760
pretending to be gay, and vice versa.

305
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,760
And it's really interesting to watch

306
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,360
how the different factions within that group communicate.

307
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,400
And like what you said, people do,

308
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,120
they're very quick to pick up the pitchfork and form a mob.

309
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:49,080
And it shows how when a lot of them,

310
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,600
one of the comments someone said was,

311
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,520
it's easy to forget that there's someone,

312
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,000
an actual person behind the screen

313
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,400
when you get on that keyboard.

314
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,800
Yeah, and I think we see that all the time

315
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,800
in YouTube comments, in Reddit comments,

316
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,000
in some of the dross that's on the internet.

317
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,800
And I think things like Google Plus and Facebook

318
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,120
and whatever, because they were real people,

319
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,080
they had somewhat of a slightly less crappy

320
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,880
signal to noise ratio, but.

321
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,840
They were kind of one of the loudest voices

322
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,720
on use your real name, use a profile picture.

323
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,960
And that was kind of one of the bigger things they pushed.

324
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,240
Just in terms of online discourse,

325
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,240
I, over the years of doing these shows,

326
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,240
have gotten many, very, very upset emails or comments.

327
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:40,760
And if I respond in kind, and I go in all guns blazing,

328
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,840
then usually it just derails.

329
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,240
But if I respond to them in a calm, rational way,

330
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,580
I have to be in the right place emotionally to do that.

331
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,760
But if I respond in sort of a calm, rational way,

332
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,240
really, my experience shows me nine times out of 10,

333
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,880
I get an email back that goes, oh, man,

334
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,360
I was just having a bad day.

335
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,480
I didn't even really think about the fact

336
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,120
that you're a real person, too.

337
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,840
I just was super upset about stuff.

338
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,280
I've gotten so many of those emails.

339
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,200
And I've been getting those since before Twitter even

340
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,100
existed, when Twitter was a podcast app that was called

341
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,640
something completely different.

342
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,020
And my point is when I use these social media networks,

343
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:20,040
I see that same disconnect that I have had interactions with

344
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,160
over email and now other mediums,

345
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,600
where people are not really wired up to fully

346
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,840
contextually communicate this way.

347
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,140
And it's another reason why we often come on the show

348
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,360
and say, if you can even just once a year

349
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,040
go to a open source style Linux style community event

350
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,560
and meet some of the people that you

351
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,520
talk to over the internet in person,

352
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,200
it will change that relationship.

353
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,400
And the reason for it is I think that the meat sack that

354
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,680
sits between our ears is a little more

355
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,560
tuned to those types of interactions

356
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,280
where it can get body language context

357
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:02,200
and the tone of your voice and the context of the conversation

358
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,000
and all of those nuances that help

359
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,160
you make an informed decision about what the person is saying.

360
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,480
And when it's all over text, we project a little bit.

361
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,200
We read intention into it.

362
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,600
We think, are they mad at us?

363
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,120
Did I do something wrong?

364
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,040
I made this mistake where I sent somebody

365
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,680
a file via Slack on Sunday.

366
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,080
And it was a co-worker who is down in Texas.

367
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,960
And she doesn't work seven days a week like I do.

368
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,320
So for her, she's getting these messages on a Sunday.

369
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,480
And she's like, OK, thanks, dot, dot, dot.

370
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,600
And that was all she sent.

371
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,940
I'm like, oh, man, did I piss her off?

372
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,160
I probably made her phone buzz on a Sunday afternoon.

373
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,560
It's evening down there.

374
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,320
And I start feeling like all these waves of guilt.

375
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,480
And I even thought about writing her apology Monday morning.

376
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,360
I thought about writing her apology right then.

377
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,080
But then I thought, no, that'll just send her more messages.

378
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,920
I shouldn't do that.

379
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,200
That'll upset her more.

380
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,680
I'll wait till Monday morning.

381
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,640
And I'll write her an apology on Monday morning saying,

382
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,680
sorry, I didn't think about your phone might beep

383
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,320
when I sent you a Slack.

384
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,420
All this is going on in my head within 30 seconds

385
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,000
of sending her that.

386
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,240
Well, it could be nothing, right?

387
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,560
It could be just she should have sent.

388
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,720
She might have meant thanks.

389
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,920
Right, yep.

390
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,640
I mean, I guess it's not surprising.

391
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,800
It is a new form of communication.

392
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,680
So maybe it isn't weird that we are struggling with it.

393
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,040
Because we're still trying to figure out the guardrails

394
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,960
and how to make it work.

395
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,560
Yeah.

396
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,160
So that's why I think it is very true

397
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,680
that the context in this kind of stuff really matters.

398
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,520
All right, well, let's shift gears now

399
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,360
and go from the heady community stuff.

400
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,560
And let's move into, and I guess one more thing to that,

401
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,200
is I think that's why things like Mumble

402
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,800
stick around, because people get more context in voice chat

403
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,160
and stuff like that.

404
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,440
OK, so let's move into some new Plasma features.

405
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,680
Yeah, the good news of the show.

406
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,480
Plasma 5.14 landed this morning.

407
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,600
And I've already updated my neon boxes.

408
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,200
It's got a couple of great new features.

409
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,800
I'll just mention a couple, because I know not everybody

410
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,400
out there cares.

411
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,440
But for those of us who follow this stuff,

412
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,080
there's a new display configuration widget

413
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,760
for screen management, which is nice.

414
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,640
You plug in an external display, a little widget

415
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,480
comes up by your system tray and says,

416
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,960
is there just a quick screen layout?

417
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,000
Do you want to go into presentation mode, which

418
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,240
I think is pretty neat?

419
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,000
Presentation mode will turn your power management settings

420
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,240
so that your computer and screen do not turn off

421
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,040
during your presentation.

422
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,320
And then it can enforce, in certain conditions,

423
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,680
presentation mode over applications, like Chrome.

424
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,640
Pretty nice.

425
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,360
And the audio volume widget now has a built-in speaker test

426
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,800
feature, which I can tell you how useful that could be.

427
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,040
Oh, yeah.

428
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,320
And thankfully, the network widget now

429
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,560
works again with SSH VPN tunnels, which is slick.

430
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,080
Right there.

431
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,440
It's one of those things that you don't think about

432
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,200
until you have one.

433
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,120
And you're like, why is this not showing up?

434
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,280
I am so thankful that it's so easy to do standard,

435
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,200
like PPTP VPNs and things like that.

436
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,360
So getting an SSH tunnel is going to be great.

437
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,120
And then just, what was it?

438
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,680
One or two episodes ago, we were talking about Discover,

439
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,640
getting FW update support.

440
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,480
So now, if you're on the Plasma 5.14

441
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,800
and you use the Discover Software Manager,

442
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,680
you'll also be plugged into LVFS and get firmware updates

443
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,800
for your rig.

444
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,360
And it gains support for snap channels, which,

445
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,360
if I am correct, is that, maybe Poppy wouldn't be correct me,

446
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,120
is that different types of the beta channel

447
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,760
versus the stable channel of a snap?

448
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,120
Right.

449
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,040
Very cool.

450
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,360
Yeah, this was a conversation we had when I was back

451
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,360
at Academy a few weeks ago.

452
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,120
Alesh is one of the KDE Discover maintainers.

453
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,000
And yeah, one of the most desired features

454
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,120
was the capability for people to switch channel

455
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,000
from within the GUI.

456
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,920
So they don't have to use a command line like a barbarian,

457
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,280
but switch channels directly in the user interface.

458
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,680
And they've implemented that in the few weeks

459
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,240
since I was in Vienna, which is really good to see.

460
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:36,800
No kidding.

461
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,360
Talk about some quick turnaround.

462
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,400
Also, some improved support for Flatpak.

463
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,200
If you try to install a standalone Flatpak file,

464
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,760
but the whole Flatpak back end hasn't been installed,

465
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,360
it'll now ask, hey, hey, genius, do

466
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,480
you want me to install the Flatpak support for you?

467
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,800
Very nice.

468
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,920
And then K-Wind, continuing its march

469
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,920
towards excellent Wayland support,

470
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,720
there is a fix in there to correct copy and paste

471
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,840
between GTK applications.

472
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,360
Oh, good.

473
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,400
I'm so glad to see that.

474
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,440
Yeah, because say you had GEdit open

475
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,560
and you wanted a copy between GEdit and K-Write,

476
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,760
you couldn't do it before on Wayland.

477
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,200
So that's been solved now.

478
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,000
And they considerably improved and polished

479
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,520
K-Wind effects throughout, including a completely rewritten

480
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,960
dim inactive effect, which is a neat effect you can set in K-Wind

481
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,160
when a window goes inactive.

482
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,920
So you get three or four windows up.

483
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,760
Only the active window is lit up.

484
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,880
The other ones can have a dim effect.

485
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,560
They can even blur a little bit.

486
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,520
They can go translucent.

487
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,680
And this is kind of a neat way to help your eye

488
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,800
cut through visual clutter.

489
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,400
So you need a couple of windows up on your screen.

490
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,560
Maybe you arrange things like on the OBS machine,

491
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,320
I've got three windows open right now.

492
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,040
It's pretty easy to tell which one's active,

493
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,160
because the Close and Minimize buttons are lit up.

494
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,720
And so that's how I can quickly tell

495
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,120
which is the active window.

496
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,320
However, if you wanted a more dramatic visual cue,

497
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,680
you could have it so that the only application that

498
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,160
was its regular lit state was the active applications.

499
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,800
And all of the other windows would take a slight dim effect.

500
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,560
And that's been totally rewritten

501
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,400
in this version of Plasma, including a new scale effect

502
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,040
and rewriting the glide effect when windows glide around

503
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,640
on the screen.

504
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,080
Just lots of little polish.

505
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,880
Love it, man.

506
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,440
I just am so happy with it.

507
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,720
And rockin' the Neon 1804.

508
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,480
And the updates came down this morning.

509
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,040
It's been.

510
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,040
I know what I'll be installing tonight.

511
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,880
And I notice like almost every day now,

512
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,000
there's some thread in our Linux or on some blog post

513
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,760
about somebody's just discovered Plasma.

514
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,640
The popularity's real.

515
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,360
It's not just us.

516
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,440
OK, nobody has anything to add to that.

517
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,560
Then let's change gears to.

518
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,320
I do.

519
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,480
I love KDE.

520
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,840
You know I do.

521
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,680
I say it every week.

522
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,280
Yeah, yeah.

523
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:47,800
And let's do it.

524
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,560
OK, well then, if Alex is going to chime in,

525
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,880
then we have to check in on Popy and Popy's laptop

526
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,120
that was installed in the air running Neon at the time.

527
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,000
Is that installation still standing, Mr. Popy?

528
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,480
That's the same installation, the one that I upgraded

529
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,720
to 1804 just last week, yes.

530
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,440
Boom.

531
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,520
Still stands.

532
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,800
All right, ladies and gentlemen, that is your Popy Neon laptop

533
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,300
update.

534
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,600
We need a jingle right there.

535
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,840
All right, now shifting gears to GNOME.

536
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,520
There's going to be some changes coming down the road,

537
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,560
probably in GNOME 3.32.

538
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,920
The application menus, or the app menus

539
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,020
as they're often called, are the menus

540
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,780
that you see up in the GNOME 3 top bar with the name

541
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,880
and the icon for the current app.

542
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,840
Well, these menus have been with us since the very, very

543
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,120
beginning of GNOME.

544
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,560
And they're going to be retired in the next released version

545
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,520
of GNOME, GNOME 3.2.

546
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,240
So no more app menus up in the top menu bar of GNOME Shell.

547
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,140
The applications themselves that have menus,

548
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,680
like when you hold down Alt for file and edit,

549
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,800
those can remain.

550
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,560
But the ones up in the Shell bar are going away.

551
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,680
One little area you could click that was never

552
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,600
used very much anyway?

553
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,760
Sometimes had quitter preferences in there.

554
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,040
They feel, and this is from Alan Day's blog post.

555
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,320
He writes, when the app menus were first introduced,

556
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,200
they were intended to play two main roles.

557
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,800
First, they were supposed to contain application level menu

558
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,360
items, like preferences about and quit.

559
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,040
Secondly, they were supposed to indicate which app was focused.

560
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,640
Unfortunately, we've seen app menus not performing well

561
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,920
over the years despite an effort to improve them.

562
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,640
People don't always engage with them.

563
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,760
Often, they haven't realized that the menus are interactive

564
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,480
or even remembered that they are there.

565
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,320
I'm not too surprised by that.

566
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,840
I'm guilty of that myself.

567
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,560
Now, he writes, we're planning on removing application menus

568
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,800
from GNOME in time for the next release, version 3.32.

569
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,480
The application menus will no longer be shown in the top bar.

570
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,360
Each GNOME application will move the items from its app menu

571
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,720
to the menu inside the application window.

572
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,560
If an application, read most of them,

573
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:57,400
if an application fails to remove its app menu by 3.32,

574
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,920
it will be shown in the app's header bar

575
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,960
using the fallback UI that is already provided by GTK.

576
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,720
This means there's no danger of menu items

577
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,240
not being accessible if the app fails to migrate in time.

578
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,160
I think I'd love to hear Wimpy's take on this,

579
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,480
just because he's our number one Ubuntu Mate guy right here.

580
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,520
Boom, right there.

581
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,880
And Ubuntu Mate is kind of around because a lot of people

582
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,120
don't like the changes in GNOME.

583
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,160
I wasn't sure how far I could take that.

584
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,920
So Wimpy, what are your thoughts on these kinds of changes?

585
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,040
My first thought, and I'll let you take it from there,

586
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,200
was I wonder if there was a discussion about how

587
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,120
to improve them and make them more useful,

588
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,960
or if the conversation immediately went,

589
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,160
let's remove them.

590
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,080
Who can say I wasn't part of those conversations?

591
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,640
Obviously, GNOME have their own design direction,

592
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,560
and they've iterated on that over many years now.

593
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:54,280
And they've also not been frightened

594
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:59,680
of going back from a decision they've made previously.

595
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:04,840
So I think we should let them do the things the way they want

596
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:09,960
to do it, because if GNOME isn't a desktop interface

597
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,080
workflow that you are comfortable with or like,

598
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,760
then good news.

599
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,880
Linux has got plenty of other desktop environments

600
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,360
to choose from, and I'm sure there's

601
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,680
one out there that will suit you more appropriately.

602
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,840
Hmm, hmm, I'm reading between lines there a little bit.

603
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,600
Not really.

604
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,320
Honestly, from my point of view, I

605
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,720
don't actually care what GNOME decide to do or don't do.

606
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,700
It's their project.

607
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,040
It's down to them and their designers

608
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,800
to set the direction that they want to go in.

609
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,240
And if some people love that stuff

610
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,120
and it draws people to GNOME, then great.

611
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,400
And if some people don't like it and it pushes people

612
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,520
towards KDE or Marte or something else,

613
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,640
then that's fine too.

614
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,280
There's still plenty of well-supported desktop

615
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,800
environments out there and all the major distributions.

616
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,840
So yeah, just find one that suits you.

617
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,200
OK, that does make sense.

618
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,320
Now, here's what the counter-argument would be.

619
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,720
The counter-argument would be, well, now Wimpy

620
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,040
is shipping on all of the major distros by default

621
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,280
and new users coming to Linux.

622
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:19,800
Wimpy, this is what they're experiencing out of the box.

623
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,820
And so we must defend this pretend user

624
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,120
that we're making up in our heads for a straw man argument.

625
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,240
No, they're not.

626
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,880
New users aren't coming to GNOME 3.20.

627
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,240
They're coming to Ubuntu 18.04.

628
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,000
They're coming to Ubuntu 16.04.

629
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,680
That's where those users are going.

630
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:40,240
It's only the absolute lunatics who are using Arch

631
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,840
or the tiny niche who are using Fedora or the Germans who

632
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,160
are using SUSE who are getting these weird new versions

633
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:48,760
of GNOME.

634
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,440
Your average user is using Ubuntu 18.04,

635
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,400
and they're using the user interface

636
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,680
that you know and love today.

637
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,680
Yeah, and I think really what you're saying there

638
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:01,120
is that there is another layer of catch here,

639
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,920
where if something was to radically change in GNOME,

640
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,480
there's the distributions that still can have vendor patches

641
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,440
that can apply to it to restore that functionality.

642
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,640
And we get flack for that.

643
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,080
People moan at us because we hold back

644
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,080
versions of Nautilus or other things,

645
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,720
because we have a large number of users who

646
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,340
care about these things, and they tell us

647
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,720
when stuff is objectionable.

648
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,760
It's all very well designing something for the future,

649
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,720
but we've got people right now who are using these systems,

650
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,160
and they need to use a system that

651
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,760
is familiar and intuitive and easy to use

652
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,560
and all those other UX terms.

653
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,960
We'll see what this looks like in 2004

654
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,520
when the next LTS comes around.

655
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,920
It's interesting.

656
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,720
I often don't object personally to a lot of the changes

657
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,000
GNOME makes, but it's strange to see a project that

658
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,720
feels like a stable desktop that is changing so much

659
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,820
and removing features.

660
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,820
Most change I think that we see is a creative, right?

661
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,120
We're like, oh, great, I got a new feature this week.

662
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,520
That's really cool.

663
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,880
GNOME does it differently.

664
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,280
Yeah, it's simplifying, though.

665
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,640
It can be a good thing.

666
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,560
It can be an easier code base to maintain.

667
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,760
It can make moving to new display technologies easier.

668
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,720
It can make re-architecting your desktop shell easier.

669
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,440
So there's reasons to do it.

670
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,020
You're right.

671
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,440
They're not doing it for the fun.

672
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,440
They're not doing it because they want to annoy their users

673
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,880
or they don't want their desktop to be pretty and usable.

674
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,840
They're doing it because of perceived benefit

675
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,400
to the user and the developer.

676
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:33,720
So it makes total sense to do these things.

677
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,480
It's just frustrating for users who

678
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,080
have come to love icons on the desktop

679
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,180
or menus in the menu bar or whatever

680
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,840
it is that's being modified.

681
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,560
It just frustrates users because we're all resistant to change.

682
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:48,640
But you go back to what GTK2 and GNOME2 look like.

683
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,440
I was going to say like five years ago,

684
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,680
but I meant five minutes ago in Ubuntu Marte.

685
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,400
But you looked at what it looked like.

686
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,680
People have moved on, like some people have,

687
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,640
and those who haven't.

688
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,040
There are other alternatives for them.

689
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,680
Well, why don't we go back in time a little bit?

690
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,800
So you heard Popi there mention Nautilus.

691
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,520
The history of Nautilus is fascinating.

692
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,860
And I recently came across someone

693
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,640
who had front and center experience with it

694
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,880
in a completely unexpected environment

695
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,120
in a book that's out now that I'll

696
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,380
have linked to the Audible version of the show notes

697
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,880
called Creative Selection.

698
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,320
And it follows someone named Ken Koisita,

699
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,080
I think is how you say his last name.

700
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,340
And he is a software engineer who

701
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,240
has been involved in the industry for a really long

702
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,200
time.

703
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,240
And he eventually wound up at Apple,

704
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,160
and he created the keyboard for the iPhone and the iPad

705
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,660
and the Safari web browser.

706
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,680
And his story about trying to get Mozilla's source

707
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,880
code for Firefox back in the day to build is great.

708
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,680
How they discovered Conqueror and then

709
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,760
decided to go with WebKit.

710
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,400
Like that whole story is in this book, and it's fascinating.

711
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,400
But before you get there, there's

712
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,880
a little history lesson about a small little company

713
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,700
that you may have heard of before named Easel.

714
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,360
Easel was founded by Andy Hertzfeld, who's also

715
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,560
an Apple alumnus, in 1999 in a little town called Mountain

716
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,800
View, California.

717
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,580
It had 22 employees and had managed

718
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:15,040
to raise about $12 million.

719
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,380
That's not bad for a small crew.

720
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:21,200
And in Ken's book, he goes into some of those early days

721
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,400
at Easel.

722
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,360
Before coming to Apple, I had a job

723
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,600
at a startup called Easel.

724
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,800
Our goal was to create an easy-to-use Linux system

725
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,000
suitable for everyday computing, a free software

726
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,220
alternative to Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows.

727
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,160
The company was led by programmers

728
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,760
who worked on the original Macintosh in the 1980s,

729
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,840
including Bud Tribble, the first software

730
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:49,160
manager for the Mac, and Andy Hertzfeld, the software wizard

731
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,660
whose graphical user interface code helped

732
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:55,000
to set the Mac apart from the text-mode personal computers

733
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,440
that were the norm of the time.

734
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,360
These fellows were my heroes, and I joined the company

735
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,980
to work with them.

736
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,840
The elegance and simplicity of their Mac software

737
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,000
was my main inspiration for wanting

738
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,400
to become a programmer.

739
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,760
The inspiration for Easel came from Andy,

740
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,460
and his vision for the company was

741
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:17,000
fueled by the free software movement Andy identified

742
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,380
with Stallman's idealism and by the concept of developing

743
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,840
a file and icon manager that would make

744
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,160
Linux a fitting competitor to Windows and the Mac,

745
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,480
its more established rivals.

746
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,240
So their core product was really going

747
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,600
to be based around what we call today GNOME Files.

748
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,520
But GNOME Files is based off something that we all

749
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,520
refer to as Nautilus.

750
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,560
Andy called this program Nautilus,

751
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:45,280
and it would help Easel users find files, read email,

752
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,520
launch programs like word processors and spreadsheets,

753
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,720
and perhaps do cool new things like keeping

754
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,280
track of a few digital photos.

755
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,680
Easel contributed Nautilus to the GNOME Project,

756
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,560
a loosely confederated free software community whose

757
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,200
members, both individuals and companies,

758
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,720
would be providing the rest of the software

759
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,880
for the desktop computing system we were trying to build.

760
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,260
To be a part of GNOME, Nautilus had

761
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,680
to be licensed under the GPL.

762
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,240
This had important implications for Easel

763
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,600
as a commercial entity. Since people would be able to download

764
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,960
Nautilus for free once we finished it,

765
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,520
the company had to figure out some other way to make money.

766
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,240
Not surprisingly, this involved creating proprietary software

767
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,840
that Easel could charge people to use,

768
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,160
a set of proto-cloud services including automatic software

769
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,600
updates and online file storage.

770
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,680
These cloud services would live in an Easel data center

771
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,360
and would not be free.

772
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,800
The idea was to integrate Nautilus with these services

773
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,920
and position our no-cost software as a lure

774
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:53,440
to draw people to Easel's pay-to-use features.

775
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,520
The combination of dot-com fervor, enthusiasm

776
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:00,680
over Linux and free software, abundant venture capital money,

777
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,680
and our founder's connection to the Mac

778
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:06,720
made it seem to me that Easel might just be the next big thing.

779
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,220
So you have to put yourself in the mindset of the time.

780
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:12,320
This is the late 90s, early 2000s.

781
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,080
Linux is powering the dot-com boom.

782
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,880
And the hype around Linux on the desktop was really strong.

783
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,000
And it was where that joke originated.

784
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
It's the year of the Linux desktop.

785
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,200
That's where this comes from.

786
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,320
And that's why, as it goes on, it

787
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,840
gets to be even more of a joke.

788
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,440
You were doing some searching, though, during the clip,

789
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,200
and you can still find references

790
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,440
to Easel in gnome file source code?

791
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,000
Yeah, Wimpy pointed it out, but it's all over there.

792
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,600
Yeah.

793
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,840
Yeah, it's pretty fascinating.

794
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,400
And so they were like, we can't lose.

795
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,900
We've got this cool new, what he refers to in the book

796
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,200
as proto-cloud services that we didn't call it the cloud

797
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,040
back then.

798
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,360
It was just online storage.

799
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,780
It was a better day, that's for sure.

800
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,280
Yeah.

801
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,360
And they had some other really cool update management

802
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,200
software.

803
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,440
And they thought, OK, this is going to be it.

804
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,600
We'll create this software.

805
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,680
People can manage the updates across multiple Linux boxes.

806
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,040
When they run out of file storage,

807
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,280
they can save to our cloud storage.

808
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,520
They didn't call it that, which we'll have integrated in

809
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,900
with the file manager.

810
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,560
And it's just going to be great.

811
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,320
There was just a few problems.

812
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,600
Number one, people didn't have that great of bandwidth.

813
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,360
Number two, they fumbled the opportunity.

814
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,680
But if indeed we had this chance, we fumbled it.

815
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,880
We never lived up to any of our lofty goals.

816
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,080
Chief among our missteps was failing

817
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:27,040
to conceive of our software as a single product instead of

818
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,320
as a set of separate projects.

819
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,200
We never figured out how to integrate the pieces.

820
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,160
Nothing worked smoothly.

821
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,400
Our software update feature was riddled

822
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,600
with bugs that often broke programs

823
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,520
while trying to update them.

824
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,680
Our code to connect Nautilus to our cloud services

825
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,140
didn't work at all.

826
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,760
The Nautilus team had persistent problems

827
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,560
coordinating with GNOME.

828
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,920
The loose structure and lack of profit motive

829
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,520
of the free software community meant

830
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,940
that they did not share our money-making goals

831
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,560
or care to coordinate with us

832
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,800
so that we could meet our delivery schedules.

833
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,880
All these setbacks caused delay after delay.

834
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,160
Yeah, and things didn't go too well.

835
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,240
After Easel launched Nautilus 1.0,

836
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:16,240
the company then laid off 40 of its 70-member staff,

837
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,400
and then things kind of spun down from there.

838
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,640
The company didn't really manage to pull it out.

839
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,760
Despite even getting a substantial investment

840
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,440
from Dell in December of 2000,

841
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,240
the company failed to successfully monetize

842
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:33,720
or secure more funding before their venture capital ran out.

843
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:37,760
And things had changed a lot in that dot-com boom bust time.

844
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,240
By March of 2001, things just were different,

845
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,300
and the market was beginning to shift.

846
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,440
But the sort of silver lining of all of this,

847
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,040
not only did all of those folks go on

848
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,160
to do bigger and better things,

849
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,540
but we now get GNOME files,

850
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,560
because the core software was GPL.

851
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,360
And even though the company went bust,

852
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,040
and the people that worked on it are now doing other things,

853
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,760
here we are in 2018,

854
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,760
still using stuff that was created in 1999,

855
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,280
and has been refined and refined and refined over time.

856
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,720
And it's been changed a lot,

857
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,960
but it still has that heritage.

858
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,560
And it was kind of ahead of its time in a lot of ways

859
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,800
with its cloud storage solution.

860
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,400
I remember Ubuntu had one too.

861
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,760
Ubuntu 1.0 was originally gonna be a cloud storage

862
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,320
and syncing solution.

863
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,600
That was a big thing that people wanted

864
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,300
to get into for a while.

865
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:33,200
And it took really until Dropbox and that modern era

866
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,960
to get things right.

867
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,960
But that's, that GNOME files goes way back.

868
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,520
It is neat that it's still around and it's still useful.

869
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,100
It's not a bad file manager.

870
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

871
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,640
As long as you're using the Ubuntu version one,

872
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,480
apparently, no.

873
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,280
Hey-oh.

874
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,600
All right, well, so there you go.

875
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,840
There's a little GNOME history.

876
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,720
If you have a project that you would think

877
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,820
would make really good for us to go back into,

878
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,040
especially if there's like some audio we could pull

879
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,780
from a YouTube video or a book somewhere out there,

880
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,700
let us know.

881
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,520
Linuxunplug.com slash contact.

882
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,800
That was a proto-segment, sort of like a version

883
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,560
00.00001.

884
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,640
Put it out at the wall, see what it was like.

885
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,080
Yeah, we'd like to expand that later on

886
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,120
and do something a little more

887
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,340
and do projects that people are fascinated about

888
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,140
that would apply to more than just GNOME users

889
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:18,980
and things like that.

890
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,080
So if you have a suggestion,

891
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,300
Linuxunplug.com slash contact.

892
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,220
And let me check.

893
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:28,200
While I'm doing a little bit of admin work here,

894
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,000
I'm gonna bring up the jobs page.

895
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,860
It looks like there are still two AWS, oh, oh, no.

896
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,340
Only one of each now, it appears.

897
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,960
So there is an AWS training architect position

898
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,580
open at Linux Academy,

899
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:45,520
and there is a Microsoft Azure training architect position.

900
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,400
Both are full-time with full benefits and all of that,

901
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,680
and are remote.

902
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,440
So I'm gonna put a link to that in the show notes.

903
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,320
I gotta remember to do that right now.

904
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,560
I'll put a link to this in the show notes

905
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,800
if you would like to apply for those.

906
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,880
They're also looking for a full-stack node developer,

907
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,380
a Ruby developer, which is also remote,

908
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:05,600
finance controller, there's several jobs actually open.

909
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,680
Man, that Linux Academy, growing like cray-cray.

910
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,640
Moving and shaking.

911
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,560
Yeah, they are.

912
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:14,560
So I will put a link to that right above the Stratus stuff.

913
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,580
So if you're interested, go check that out.

914
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:19,640
Linuxunplug.com slash 270.

915
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,520
Figure we'll get the audience hooked up with the good stuff.

916
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,700
You know what I'm saying?

917
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,000
Looking up for the audience.

918
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,520
All right, so let's move forward now.

919
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,200
So we just looked back at known past.

920
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,400
Well, let's look forward at Linux storage in the future.

921
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,480
Now for a while, we've been talking about Project Stratus,

922
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,840
which is an effort that's happening over at Red Hat

923
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,000
to bring together various components

924
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,720
of Linux's structured subsystems for storage.

925
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,480
And there's several of them that exist already,

926
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,720
including well-established file systems like XFS

927
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,920
that I'm a huge fan of, LVM,

928
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,200
which relies on a bunch of fundamental technologies

929
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,760
that we're all pretty familiar with.

930
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,900
Stratus is a new approach to constructing

931
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,560
a volume managing file systems

932
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,160
whose really its primary innovation

933
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,200
that Stratus is bringing

934
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,060
and what's gonna kind of make it come to market pretty fast

935
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:12,360
is it's reusing existing Linux components.

936
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,200
And it really has my interest piqued

937
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,460
because A, it's based on XFS.

938
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,300
Oh, you love it.

939
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,120
You're already there.

940
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,160
You're already there.

941
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:26,160
And B, it's promising to try to drive feature-comparity

942
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,560
with ZFS and ButterFS.

943
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,500
It's pretty fascinating.

944
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:34,120
And this last week, they hit version 1.0.

945
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:34,960
The big 1.0.

946
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,360
It's a major milestone, so we thought,

947
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,320
well, let's bring one of the lead developers from Red Hat

948
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,920
on the show to talk about it.

949
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,000
We asked Andy Grover to join us.

950
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,160
So joining us right now is Andy Grover,

951
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,300
and he is a principal software engineer over at Red Hat,

952
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,400
and he's been hacking away on Project Stratus.

953
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,760
And I recently saw him blogging about 1.0.

954
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,160
Had to get him on the show and talk about it.

955
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,260
Andy, welcome to Linux Unplugged.

956
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,100
Hey, Chris.

957
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:58,920
Thanks a lot.

958
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,760
Glad to be here.

959
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,600
Hey, no, thank you very much.

960
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,480
So for the folks that aren't familiar with it,

961
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,340
give them the elevator pitch on what Project Stratus is.

962
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:08,560
Well, I think we have a couple options

963
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,520
for advanced storage features on Linux,

964
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,280
but I don't think any of them, for various reasons,

965
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,400
have really necessarily hit all the sweet spots.

966
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,040
So I don't know if Stratus is gonna hit all the sweet spots,

967
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,240
but I think it's gonna fill in.

968
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:27,040
It really is meant to provide an easier way

969
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,060
for people to manage their local storage

970
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:33,560
so they don't have to worry about extending partitions

971
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,960
or anything like that.

972
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:39,740
It's just, it kind of does all those things for you,

973
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,440
and so you just get the benefits

974
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,560
of these advanced storage features.

975
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,640
There's like ZFS and ButterFest.

976
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,680
They have snapshots, and they have built-in,

977
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,120
a lot of built-in features

978
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:57,040
that we want to make easy to use for everybody.

979
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,440
So that's kind of where we're trying to come from.

980
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,040
What about some of the projects out there right now?

981
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,480
I mean, ZFS, ButterFS,

982
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,320
or even some of the up-and-coming things like BcashFS.

983
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,280
What about those made them not really seem like a good fit?

984
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,000
Why a new project?

985
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,720
That's a great question.

986
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,840
Well, I think coming as a Red Hat developer,

987
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:21,840
I think ZFS is just, the licensing terms are a real problem

988
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,640
for the powers that be to go with that.

989
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,360
Not that other distros haven't said,

990
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,120
hey, okay, we're gonna go for it,

991
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,920
but I think Red Hat and Fedora,

992
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:37,600
very conservative when it comes to patents, codecs,

993
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,840
and the licensing.

994
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,400
So that kind of ruled out ZFS as something

995
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,760
that we could do.

996
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,160
ButterFS, oh boy, ButterFS.

997
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:50,440
Oh boy, I can't believe it's not ButterFS.

998
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,640
Yeah, right?

999
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,880
I mean, it was in tech preview in RHEL 7

1000
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,160
for a long time before it got pulled.

1001
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,040
I'm sure you talked a lot about that.

1002
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:02,040
So it just hasn't quite gotten there yet.

1003
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,320
I know some distros are shipping it,

1004
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:11,320
but even like Ubuntu, they're shipping ZFS.

1005
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,040
So I don't know.

1006
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,880
It's just like, it's not quite what we need it to be.

1007
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,240
It hasn't passed the test, the SNF test, essentially.

1008
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,000
It hasn't quite got enterprise grade stamped yet.

1009
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,500
Well, I don't wanna say that it's not right for some people,

1010
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,880
but it's just, it's not right for everybody, so.

1011
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,220
Yeah.

1012
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,060
So fair enough.

1013
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,880
So, but okay, so I think the core of the question is,

1014
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,880
is trying to fish out why not launch a 10-year project

1015
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:40,720
and build the next revolutionary file system for Linux?

1016
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,320
Why was that not the solution?

1017
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,240
Well, I think you kinda answered the question right there.

1018
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,580
Yeah, time is imperative in this.

1019
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:50,600
Do you feel like maybe Linux is a little behind,

1020
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,480
say, what ZFS is capable of,

1021
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,240
and so we needed a practical solution

1022
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,320
that was bolting together existing tech?

1023
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,060
I think that there were some,

1024
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,720
and this has happened before with Linux.

1025
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,560
I think we were behind early on in our USB support,

1026
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,120
and we kind of like, other OSes

1027
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,600
kind of highlight some deficiencies,

1028
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,040
and then we kind of like, rally and effort and catch up.

1029
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,760
So I think it, I think we're a little bit behind,

1030
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:19,760
and it's not that you can't do everything on Linux.

1031
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,640
It's just, you know, LVM, I mean, a lot,

1032
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,960
I think we'll talk about this more later.

1033
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,600
I mean, LVM and Stratus are both kind of leveraging

1034
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,600
the same core kernel capabilities,

1035
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:36,120
but LVM maybe isn't necessarily as easy as it could be to use

1036
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,080
and some of the other options aren't

1037
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,880
maybe an option either, so I think there's space

1038
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,460
for Stratus to come in and support these things

1039
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:49,880
and get there and have it in two years instead of 10 years.

1040
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,540
Yeah, that seems like one of the key things there.

1041
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,080
So what are some of those things?

1042
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,600
You touched on this just for a second there.

1043
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,480
It sounds like Stratus would be using

1044
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,640
some of the same plumbing that LVM's been using for years.

1045
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,520
What are some of those existing well-established components

1046
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,580
of Linux that Stratus takes advantage of?

1047
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:11,240
Well, I think people, a lot of time, if they've used LVM,

1048
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:15,760
there's LVM and then there's this thing called Device Mapper

1049
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,200
and Device Mapper is the kernel code that LVM uses.

1050
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,320
So you can use Device Mapper through LVM,

1051
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,840
but you can also use Device Mapper in other ways.

1052
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,480
And Device Mapper, learning how to use Device Mapper

1053
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,400
for me was really like a kid in a candy shop

1054
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,240
because, I mean, there's so much there.

1055
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,080
There's so many capabilities.

1056
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:37,640
There's RAID, there's thin provisioning, there's integrity.

1057
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:41,960
There's all these fringe Device Mapper targets

1058
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,320
that different people have written

1059
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,260
that do different cool things.

1060
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:49,480
And all of those things can be put together in different ways

1061
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,060
and used in different ways.

1062
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:52,960
And you can use LVM to do that,

1063
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,160
but there are also different ways

1064
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,780
that you can put the Lego box together.

1065
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:00,280
So that's what we're trying to do with Stratus

1066
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:04,520
and make those available and more friendly to use.

1067
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,600
It really seems in that sense

1068
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,040
that Device Mapper is doing a lot of the magic

1069
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,280
and you've just been able to tie it together

1070
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,360
and add on a little bit of niceness with XFS on top.

1071
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,240
A lot of it, yeah.

1072
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,800
So I mean, one thing that Stratus 1.0 supports

1073
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,800
is thin provisioning.

1074
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,880
So this is something that lets you create file systems

1075
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,320
and they don't actually use the amount of space

1076
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,160
that they're actually using

1077
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,720
and you can have a pool that's shared

1078
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,660
amongst different file systems.

1079
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:32,560
Stratus supports this,

1080
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,560
but it's like, we haven't had to like implement it.

1081
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,000
The other smart people who have implemented

1082
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,360
the thin provisioning support in Device Mapper,

1083
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,360
we just get to make use of that.

1084
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,740
We get to make it easier to use for people.

1085
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:48,480
And that makes, I mean,

1086
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,440
that saves a tremendous amount of effort to leverage that.

1087
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,960
And like you said, to leverage XFS file system,

1088
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,120
we don't have to write a file system.

1089
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,520
We have a great file system

1090
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,240
that we can just pick up and use.

1091
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,080
So.

1092
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:00,920
Amen to that, brother.

1093
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:01,740
Yeah.

1094
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:02,580
Amen.

1095
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:04,080
So speaking of great file systems,

1096
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:07,400
one thing I've always enjoyed about ZFS is by and large,

1097
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,600
I can kind of move things around.

1098
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,800
If I've made a dataset on one machine,

1099
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,000
as long as it doesn't have a lot of crazy feature flags,

1100
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,960
I can use that on another machine.

1101
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,320
How's that gonna work for Stratus,

1102
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,820
especially if, you know, different kernel versions,

1103
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:22,640
different user space tools exist, will it be portable?

1104
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,760
I think it won't be entirely,

1105
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,840
if you're, it always goes back to the things

1106
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,500
that Stratus is kind of wrapping and putting a bow on.

1107
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,520
So it's like, you need a file system,

1108
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,680
you need a kernel that supports XFS.

1109
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,620
Well, they're all, you know,

1110
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:38,480
that's all of them at this point.

1111
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,560
You need a kernel that supports

1112
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,520
the device mapper targets that we're using.

1113
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:47,520
So that's thin provisioning and a cache target.

1114
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:49,520
So, and that's pretty much all of them too,

1115
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,280
but there's a lot of other device mapper targets

1116
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,440
on the horizon.

1117
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,960
One really exciting one is called VDO,

1118
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:02,600
which does a block level deduplication and compression.

1119
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,700
So if in some future Stratus version,

1120
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:08,220
we incorporate support for VDO,

1121
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:11,400
then that would mean that, you know,

1122
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,800
we'll have checks and stuff to make sure that

1123
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,460
if you then move those, that pool,

1124
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:18,280
that file system to an older machine

1125
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,840
that doesn't have support for that in the kernel for that,

1126
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:23,440
that that's a consequence of, you know,

1127
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,020
if it's not there, then it can't work.

1128
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:28,400
So that's kind of where we are.

1129
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,240
Okay.

1130
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,200
I think that's probably to be expected,

1131
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,100
especially at this stage in the project.

1132
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:34,280
So let me ask you something else

1133
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,360
that's gonna be a little more challenging to answer.

1134
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,780
If I were to have a conversation with say a ZFS expert,

1135
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:46,600
they tell me that what part of what makes ZFS so dang great

1136
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,280
is that it's total integration from top to bottom.

1137
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,000
In fact, there's such fans of it.

1138
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:51,840
Andy, they'd say,

1139
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,060
don't even use one of those dirty RAID controller cards.

1140
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:56,040
Don't put a dirty hardware RAID in there.

1141
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,380
Let ZFS control the entire stack

1142
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:00,380
because of its integrated brilliance.

1143
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:02,680
And then Andy comes along and says,

1144
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:04,240
actually, we could do this

1145
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,080
with a bunch of different existing technologies

1146
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,960
and have something that works great.

1147
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,080
What's your response to the,

1148
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,680
it has to be integrated or it's gonna be bogus?

1149
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,980
That's, yes.

1150
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:18,880
It almost feels like a religion war

1151
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,840
when I hear them talk about it.

1152
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:22,200
It's like, it's a way of believing that,

1153
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,800
like it's a handcrafted integrated solution.

1154
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,640
But in a way,

1155
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:29,520
Stratus feels more like a genuine old school Unix solution.

1156
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,920
I think that's a good point.

1157
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:33,240
I mean, so Unix is about like reuse

1158
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:36,600
and combining things that do one thing

1159
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,200
into things that do multiple things.

1160
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:44,200
So, ZFS has been called a rampant layering violation.

1161
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,580
And I think they did it for good reasons.

1162
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:49,660
There are advantages to doing it that way.

1163
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:53,420
Some, I think that,

1164
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:55,100
I'm not sure if all those advantages

1165
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,420
have actually been fully realized.

1166
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:59,420
So, I'm pretty optimistic

1167
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:02,140
about what we'll be able to achieve.

1168
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:03,860
Like one of the things is like,

1169
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:08,860
like if you have a disc that fails on a ZFS pool,

1170
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:12,400
it's like you can track like, or excuse me,

1171
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,340
if you have like a sector that fails on a disc

1172
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,900
in a ZFS pool, it's like you can track all the way up

1173
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,880
through the ZFS data structures

1174
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,620
to like exactly the files that are affected.

1175
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:27,180
So, that is gonna be harder for Stratus,

1176
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:29,980
but I think it still could be possible.

1177
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:31,560
And I think that there are other advantages

1178
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,780
that having a more layered approach give us

1179
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:36,900
that can outweigh that.

1180
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:38,620
So, looking at some of your documentation,

1181
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:41,020
it really became clear that the API

1182
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:43,020
is a core part of Stratus

1183
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,460
and that there's a lot of design around making that

1184
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:47,020
like a prime feature.

1185
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:48,100
Why is that?

1186
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:52,980
Well, I think if you look at the state of computing now

1187
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:55,660
compared to 10 years ago,

1188
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:59,780
we have this kind of, if you wanna call it a renaissance,

1189
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:01,460
you have this move to the cloud,

1190
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:06,120
you have orchestration, you have Kubernetes,

1191
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:09,220
you have Docker, you have Puppet, you have Chef.

1192
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:12,620
I mean, individual machines are less configured by people

1193
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:15,260
and more configured by kind of layers of automation

1194
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:19,020
on top to achieve more productivity.

1195
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:21,340
So, I think it was very important for us

1196
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:23,580
that Stratus be able to work

1197
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:25,740
within an automated environment.

1198
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:28,140
And I think having the API is very important

1199
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:30,340
to making sure that that's possible.

1200
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:31,740
I mean, I'm grateful already

1201
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:33,920
just if I don't have to do any more text scraping

1202
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,620
of command line utilities, if there's a real API, oh boy.

1203
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:39,020
No kidding, right?

1204
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:42,700
I'm really not a fan of scraping of command line tools

1205
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:46,300
and that's, it's, yeah.

1206
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:49,100
So, I really feel strongly at that

1207
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:52,180
and that really kind of made the API be something

1208
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:53,660
that we really wanted to focus on.

1209
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:56,460
And I think that's gonna be one of the leading factors

1210
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,420
of adoption for this.

1211
00:49:58,420 --> 00:49:59,460
I think that's what's gonna drive

1212
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:00,760
other distributions to adopt it.

1213
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,140
So, let's talk about that for a second.

1214
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:02,980
Okay.

1215
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:05,500
I bet the intention here is to have this

1216
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:08,420
to be more than a quote unquote red hat project.

1217
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:09,420
It'd probably be nice to have it be

1218
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:11,060
a general community project.

1219
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:11,900
That would be great.

1220
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:12,900
How is that possible?

1221
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,500
Like, what thoughts do you have there?

1222
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,680
I'm not asking you to solve the problem,

1223
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,740
but do you have thoughts around opening it up

1224
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:18,980
to a wider community?

1225
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:21,220
Well, I think it's kind of, if you build it,

1226
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:22,780
they will come sort of thing.

1227
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:26,980
Just like practicing as much of our developments

1228
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:30,800
in the open and on GitHub as much as possible,

1229
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,260
this ongoing discussions and IRC,

1230
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:37,820
that's what we can do and publicizing it

1231
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:42,820
and kind of stating our desires to work with other people.

1232
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,380
And I think it always,

1233
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:46,020
like you kind of have to like have something

1234
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:50,460
and then people see that and they wanna work on something

1235
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:54,100
that their efforts aren't gonna go to waste.

1236
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:58,280
So, I hope that with 1.0, we've shown that we're serious

1237
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:01,680
and that we'd like to work with other people and build it.

1238
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,460
And the more the project goes on,

1239
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:06,940
like the more possible new things and interesting things

1240
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:11,320
that people could hook onto and make their own

1241
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,160
in the code base,

1242
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,860
I think the number of those things has really gone up.

1243
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:17,980
So, I'm hopeful that people will do that.

1244
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:22,620
It's a little bit difficult because we chose...

1245
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,140
So, we didn't write it in C,

1246
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:26,540
we decided to write it in Rust.

1247
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:28,340
And there's a lot of reasons why we decided to do that,

1248
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:29,240
that we can talk about,

1249
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:32,820
but the big concern was that that was gonna hinder

1250
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:37,020
our adoption of that was gonna kind of push away developers

1251
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:38,620
a little bit, I hope it doesn't,

1252
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:42,340
and maybe it'll attract other potential developers.

1253
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:43,860
So, it was like developers

1254
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:47,300
and then getting onto other distros

1255
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:52,300
that it's an additional build dependency that is there.

1256
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:57,100
So, I'm hoping that things will work out.

1257
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,000
Right, I think the choice to use Rust

1258
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,900
was a really fascinating one.

1259
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:03,460
I think that's actually something I've heard people mention

1260
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:04,380
about the project.

1261
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:07,220
So, it's created some hype in some circles at least.

1262
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:09,060
So, maybe it's done some good as well.

1263
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:10,360
Yeah, the little Rust circles,

1264
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,980
they're definitely behind us.

1265
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:13,940
Yeah, they're passionate.

1266
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:17,500
Okay, well, 1.0 is obviously a big deal symbolically.

1267
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,660
Does this mean I should be using Stratus?

1268
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:21,300
Are you recommending it for general use

1269
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,820
or even just for playing around

1270
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:24,620
or should we hold off a bit?

1271
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:28,700
I think 1.0 is important for a couple big reasons,

1272
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:32,100
like putting a stake in the ground

1273
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:34,240
and stabilizing our on-disk metadata.

1274
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,580
I think that was important.

1275
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:37,380
We're working,

1276
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:40,460
let's just say we're working on a 1.01 release right now

1277
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,780
that's gonna fix some pretty serious issues

1278
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:45,220
and we're also working on a 1.1 release.

1279
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:49,600
So, I would definitely hold off,

1280
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,740
even adventurous people,

1281
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:53,420
just give us like a couple more months

1282
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,260
and then the less adventurous people,

1283
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:58,260
they can hear what the adventurous people say

1284
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:00,340
and then they can make a decision at that point.

1285
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:05,340
Is the goal to get 1.0 of some form shipped in Fedora 29?

1286
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:06,300
Yeah, that's the goal.

1287
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:09,460
We're a Fedora feature.

1288
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:12,020
0.5 was in Fedora 28.

1289
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:12,860
Oh yeah.

1290
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,860
And was pretty rough,

1291
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:16,420
but I mean, it's more about like,

1292
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:19,780
you kind of need these milestones for yourself

1293
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:22,180
and for people who are following the project

1294
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:24,020
to kind of understand where the things are.

1295
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:27,580
So, 1.0 will be in Fedora 29.

1296
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:29,420
I think that's gonna be probably the best place

1297
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:32,180
for a lot of people to try out Stratus.

1298
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:34,140
I heard you say we a few times.

1299
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:35,820
Can you give me like a rough idea

1300
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:37,020
of like how is the project structured?

1301
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:39,100
Is it more than just Andy?

1302
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:39,940
Is it a few people?

1303
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:42,100
Is it a whole division within Red Hat

1304
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:43,020
that has its own building?

1305
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:43,860
Like what kind of?

1306
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:45,780
Okay, all right.

1307
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:47,380
But maybe that's a little overboard,

1308
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:48,900
but like what's it look like?

1309
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,820
Well, our core team is four people right now,

1310
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:55,300
including myself, all Red Hat people

1311
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:58,620
and we've also had a number of kind of

1312
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:01,300
what you could call like drive-by contributions

1313
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:03,460
from a number of people mixing up things.

1314
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:06,820
So yeah, there's four of us at Red Hat

1315
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:09,260
currently working full-time on the project

1316
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:13,940
and hopefully we can attract some more small contributions

1317
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:15,180
and then those small contributions

1318
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:17,580
can lead to larger contributions.

1319
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:22,180
Well, Andy, I'll have links to the project page,

1320
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:23,220
your Twitter.

1321
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:25,060
Is there anywhere else you wanna send people to

1322
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:26,980
that might be interested in the project?

1323
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:32,380
Well, we had a G Plus page before they killed G Plus.

1324
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:34,140
Too soon, too soon, Andy.

1325
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:36,700
I would also just, yeah,

1326
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:39,100
make sure you put the Stratus storage Twitter.

1327
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:42,100
I think that's the primary one, so.

1328
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,740
We will have that in the show notes as well.

1329
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:46,820
Well, Andy, I hope you and the team keep up the great work.

1330
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:49,100
We're pretty excited to watch where this project goes

1331
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:50,500
and thanks so much for coming on the show

1332
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:51,620
and explaining some of this to us.

1333
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:53,020
Maybe we'll chat again in the future.

1334
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:54,620
All right, well, hey, thanks for having me

1335
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:56,500
and have a good one.

1336
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,180
It's gonna be an XFS future, I think,

1337
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:02,620
at least for a lot of us, not like ZFS is going anywhere,

1338
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:06,540
but it'll be nice to see this sort of become an option

1339
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:08,060
for Linux users, I think.

1340
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:09,580
I'm delighted to hear they've based it

1341
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:12,260
on the existing technologies for the most part

1342
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:14,460
and most importantly, XFS.

1343
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,740
I am looking forward to the thin provisioning.

1344
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:18,700
I was talking to Wes about that.

1345
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:21,380
I have a one terabyte MVNE in my disk,

1346
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:23,260
or in my laptop, it's a one terabyte disk

1347
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:25,580
and I am really looking forward to just saying,

1348
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:29,020
make home a terabyte and I'll just figure it out later.

1349
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:30,740
I have to look at the space eventually at some point

1350
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:33,220
and LVM was always too much to manage.

1351
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:34,220
This is gonna be nice.

1352
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:36,900
Yeah, you have a simple, I mean, we've already tried it.

1353
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:39,300
The command line interface is pretty clean.

1354
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,980
It was easy to get set up, it's easy to use, it's fast.

1355
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:43,860
So there's not a lot of blockers

1356
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:46,100
once you actually have a package to install.

1357
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:47,340
All right, well, we'll keep an eye on it,

1358
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:50,380
see where things goes and we'll have all the links

1359
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:52,740
in the show notes where you can read more,

1360
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,900
including get diagrams about how this thing works

1361
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:57,260
or what layer it's sitting in the Linux stack

1362
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:58,340
and all of that is there.

1363
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:00,740
Also, for your reading enjoyment,

1364
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:03,700
this is a great benchmark that Wes found

1365
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:07,580
over at scalegrid.io and they decided to compare XFS

1366
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:12,580
and Extended 4 on their AWS EC2 MongoDB instances.

1367
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:14,040
How about that for a title?

1368
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,620
And you know what, both are great file systems

1369
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:18,100
is the long and short of it.

1370
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:23,060
And if you have a moderate to, you know, average rig,

1371
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:24,660
you're really not gonna see much of a difference

1372
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:25,500
in terms of performance.

1373
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:26,380
Probably just doesn't matter, right?

1374
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:28,180
Pick the one that is easiest to use.

1375
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:30,220
However, if you have a significant workload

1376
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:34,380
or you have a particularly fast rig and fast disk,

1377
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:35,900
well, this is how they summed up the difference.

1378
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:37,580
I thought it was pretty good.

1379
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:40,240
They say XFS is spectacularly fast

1380
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:44,220
during both the insertion phase and the workload execution.

1381
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:48,540
And they say down in the like really pushing type workloads

1382
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:50,980
that XFS maintains its lead and its throughput

1383
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:52,340
better than Extended 4 does.

1384
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:54,980
And in general, in performance terms,

1385
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:58,900
XFS is indeed a force multiplier

1386
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:00,480
when paired with high-speed disk

1387
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:04,740
that can take a real advantage of a high-end PC.

1388
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:08,100
It is a force multiplier, they write Wes,

1389
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:09,220
a force multiplier.

1390
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:10,340
XFS is just great.

1391
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:11,580
I just really love it.

1392
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:14,300
That's why I was so stung when those guys and gals

1393
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:15,700
over at Dropbox announced

1394
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:17,260
that they were ending support for anything.

1395
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,980
It was rough, it was rough.

1396
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:20,060
It's such a good file system.

1397
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:21,860
I'm not over it yet, I'm not over it yet.

1398
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:24,380
Replacing Dropbox is one of the many things

1399
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:25,260
on my to-do list.

1400
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:26,860
I got a lot going on, you know?

1401
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:29,140
Living the VP life these days, Wes.

1402
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:31,020
I got wound care, I got a lot going on.

1403
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:31,980
I got three kids, Wes.

1404
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:33,740
You don't even sleep, that's how busy you are.

1405
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:34,740
This is actually true.

1406
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:37,140
This is just a lot going on and I need to manage all of it,

1407
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:38,640
reclaim some of my sanity,

1408
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,740
so I've decided to get my crap together.

1409
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:42,980
So you got just a big wall of post-it notes?

1410
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:43,940
I assume that's what you're doing.

1411
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:45,580
Actually did start with a whiteboard,

1412
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:49,580
realized that did not scale, also was not portable,

1413
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:53,340
and could not be done on the fly via my phone.

1414
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:57,380
So then I wanted something that would let me manage my tasks

1415
00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:02,020
from the phone, from a lady tube, and from Linux.

1416
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,980
That's a big ask, those are some integrations.

1417
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,520
You know, there's some really nice to-do apps

1418
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,860
for every phone out there.

1419
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:07,700
They're really great,

1420
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,100
but they're like only available for the phone.

1421
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:11,220
Like they don't have a web component necessarily.

1422
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:13,860
That's okay, I can't, I need something on the desktop.

1423
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:15,540
Or the ones that do like Wunderlist

1424
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:16,900
have never really stuck with me.

1425
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:18,580
It's never really held me down.

1426
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:20,940
I can't really, it just doesn't work with me.

1427
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:24,060
Well, I'm pretty pleased so far with Todoist,

1428
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:26,700
and I've linked in the show notes, it is an Electron app,

1429
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:29,340
but it is a wrapper for the official Todoist web app,

1430
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:30,740
and it's, I tried a couple of them.

1431
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:33,560
There's a few of them out there if you search for this,

1432
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:35,300
but this is the one I like the best.

1433
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:38,260
It'll support auto start and minimize down to the tray

1434
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:39,820
with a system tray icon.

1435
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:41,420
It has keyboard shortcuts

1436
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:44,280
that work more like the native application.

1437
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:48,580
It has just a native-like desktop feel.

1438
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:50,100
It has the quirks of a web app,

1439
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:52,660
but they've gotten it pretty close,

1440
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:54,340
and it comes available as a deb

1441
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:56,300
or it's in a lot of different repos.

1442
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,360
Yeah, so it's easy to get going.

1443
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:01,740
And I've combined this with the app on the phone

1444
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,820
and the app on the lady tube,

1445
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:08,000
and now I've got sort of ubiquitous task management.

1446
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,820
I can summon Siri or the Echo,

1447
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:11,940
and I can say, add a task to my list.

1448
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:16,220
I can sit down, and I just have a Workspace 5

1449
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:17,860
dedicated to this application.

1450
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:19,340
It's the only thing on Workspace 5,

1451
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:22,020
so I can go right to Workspace 5 and make it to do boom, boom,

1452
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:23,500
boom as fast as I can think about it.

1453
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:24,340
And that's key, right?

1454
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:25,700
You need something, you need to be able to dump them

1455
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:27,540
as they come up, as you come up with them.

1456
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:29,140
Yeah, the other thing is great.

1457
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:30,900
It has natural language support.

1458
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,340
So if I need to, say, write down a task

1459
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:36,960
to finish the expense report for that lunch

1460
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,420
we went out to on Friday,

1461
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:42,340
I can write finish expense report Wednesday at 1 p.m.,

1462
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:45,160
and it will automatically just, it'll understand that,

1463
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,920
and it'll create the finish expense report,

1464
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:49,920
and then the Wednesday, and it'll itemize all of that out

1465
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,100
and create a reminder, yeah, and put it on the calendar.

1466
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:54,980
It's nice, it's really smooth.

1467
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:58,260
So getting a version on Linux that felt close to native,

1468
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:01,500
that had a tray icon and all of that kind of stuff

1469
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,700
to like a full-fledged application,

1470
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:05,520
that's what sort of pushed it over the edge for me

1471
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,360
from some of the other ones.

1472
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:09,500
So we'll have a link into Todoist for Linux.

1473
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:12,060
There's a lot of them out there,

1474
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:14,580
but only one of them passed the Chris Niff test.

1475
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:15,540
So you gotta check that out.

1476
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:17,300
I mean, I know you're picky about these apps, too,

1477
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:20,060
so you're pickier than I am, so that's probably a good bet.

1478
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:21,160
It's worth checking out.

1479
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:22,780
You watch out, don't get me too hyped,

1480
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:23,860
because if I go all into it,

1481
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:25,900
then I'll sign up for the Enterprise version,

1482
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:27,840
and I'll be getting you to install it, so.

1483
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:28,680
All right.

1484
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:29,500
Well, see how it goes.

1485
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,340
I like it.

1486
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:31,540
You say that now, you say that now.

1487
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:32,380
It's pretty cool.

1488
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:34,980
It does have good team management features,

1489
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:37,820
and the other thing that kind of made me want to use Todoist

1490
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:40,220
over some of the other quote-unquote services

1491
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:41,780
or self-hosted solutions,

1492
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:46,700
I want something that is a Todo application

1493
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:49,060
for a spectrum of my life.

1494
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:52,880
Like, it's not like a full spectrum Todo management.

1495
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:57,380
It's kind of like a narrow slice

1496
01:00:57,380 --> 01:00:59,820
of the things I need to do in my work and personal life.

1497
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:01,620
It's kind of a weird way I have it,

1498
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:03,060
and so I'm using Todoist for that,

1499
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:05,900
and for this particular slice,

1500
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:08,540
it's really great to be able to send things

1501
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:10,780
in and out of Todoist from different applications.

1502
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:15,100
So I've got like this OCR scanner for my phone.

1503
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:16,860
Yeah, like I hold it over a receipt.

1504
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:19,340
Oh yeah, like just some document you want to, totally.

1505
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:20,960
It imports all the details,

1506
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:23,220
and it figures out what I paid at the restaurant,

1507
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:24,700
and then I can import that

1508
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:27,140
into the expense management system.

1509
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:28,900
All of that routes through Todoist.

1510
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:30,620
Todoist is sort of like the central piece

1511
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:31,620
that can coordinate all of that,

1512
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:32,860
so it's really nice to have something

1513
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:36,540
that you don't get from a self-hosted task warrior server.

1514
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:38,860
I've tried, and I mean, it was not too bad,

1515
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:40,460
but just not that shiny.

1516
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:41,380
You know, I could see a place

1517
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:43,420
for like a separate task management system

1518
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:45,660
that was for like stuff with the family,

1519
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:48,980
and the dog, and you know, like my medical stuff.

1520
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:50,960
Yeah, I've had some look for like shared Trello boards

1521
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:51,900
for that sort of thing.

1522
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:52,720
But that's for like-

1523
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:53,560
Whoa, full Trello.

1524
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:54,580
Full Trello, Wes?

1525
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:56,740
That was for some bigger plannings.

1526
01:01:56,740 --> 01:01:57,580
You maniac.

1527
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:59,060
Maybe this works better for things where you just like,

1528
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:00,420
yeah, firing off one-off tasks

1529
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:01,480
you need to not forget about.

1530
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:02,940
See, TechMav knows exactly what's up.

1531
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:04,420
TechMav in the chat room says,

1532
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:06,740
ScanBot and Todoist, this is what I'm talking about.

1533
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:08,140
This is what actually pushed me over

1534
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:10,700
is when I started using these two apps together.

1535
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:12,100
Bosh.

1536
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:14,220
Mind-blowing, man, just mind-blowingly.

1537
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:16,040
It makes doing some of those tedious things

1538
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:18,480
that I hate to do and forget to do easy,

1539
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:21,500
because when I have the receipt in my task manager,

1540
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:23,900
it's like when that task comes due,

1541
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:25,820
the information I need to complete the task

1542
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:27,460
is right there in OCR for me.

1543
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:28,820
Copy, paste, boom, I'm done.

1544
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:29,860
It makes it so much quicker.

1545
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:30,700
I love it.

1546
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:32,100
You just get your work done.

1547
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:36,380
And they give you an iCal feed

1548
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:38,060
so you can sync it to a calendar

1549
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:40,620
so you can get all of the tasks overlaid on your calendar.

1550
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:41,660
Perfect, I love it.

1551
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:43,700
So anyways, that's my pitch for Todoist.

1552
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:45,980
I actually signed up for their premium one, too,

1553
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:47,220
because then you get some features

1554
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:48,340
that they should just build in.

1555
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:50,040
I'm pretty sure you just want an excuse

1556
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,820
to promote one more Electron app.

1557
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:54,540
Well done, well done, sir.

1558
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:56,540
You are talking to the guy who runs Netafire

1559
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:58,540
on all of the web apps he uses all the time now.

1560
01:02:58,540 --> 01:02:59,500
I'm that guy.

1561
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:03,820
I'm like, I'm spinning up spaces on my desktop.

1562
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:05,460
I'm spinning up virtual desktops,

1563
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:07,420
just that way I can put another Netafire window

1564
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:08,400
on that virtual desktop.

1565
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:09,240
It's getting better.

1566
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:12,020
There's so many damn web apps these days, Wes, so many.

1567
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:14,540
All right, well go get yourself some more poppy and wimpy

1568
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:16,860
and Mark II over at the Ubuntu podcast.

1569
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:17,980
Go enjoy.

1570
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:19,580
Another fine episode.

1571
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:22,100
Is it season 11, episode 30 that just came out?

1572
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:23,160
It is, yeah.

1573
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,420
Ooh, it's getting close, isn't it?

1574
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:25,500
It's getting close.

1575
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:28,480
It's almost end of season time.

1576
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:29,320
Oh no.

1577
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:32,420
Three months and then we'll take a season break.

1578
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:33,940
Oh, it's, oh, okay, three months.

1579
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:34,760
That's not too bad.

1580
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:35,600
What are we gonna do?

1581
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,180
Yeah, we finish at Christmas.

1582
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:38,020
Oh, okay.

1583
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:39,400
That's not, I mean, I can prep myself.

1584
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,940
That's enough time for me to let that soak in.

1585
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:44,580
I can, that's, you know, that's good to know

1586
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:45,920
because now I can prep myself.

1587
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:46,960
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1588
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,220
What do you listen to when you need a break

1589
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:49,540
from your relatives around the holidays?

1590
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:50,900
We need a season break, you're right.

1591
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:53,140
We do need a season break, I like that.

1592
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:54,980
Our season could just be like the Christmas holiday.

1593
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:55,820
It could be, yeah.

1594
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:57,700
You know, it could be like a short season break.

1595
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:59,500
We don't have to like have this whole curry rule.

1596
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:00,340
That could just be something.

1597
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:02,020
We could just get curry on the side anyway

1598
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:02,860
while we're working.

1599
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:03,680
Yeah, man.

1600
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:04,520
You're doing it wrong.

1601
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:05,860
If you don't have curry, you're just doing it wrong.

1602
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:06,700
Yeah, we really.

1603
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:07,520
That's mandatory.

1604
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,180
So yeah, okay, all right, that doesn't make sense.

1605
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:10,860
The more we think about it, actually.

1606
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:14,180
If we can have an excuse to mandate getting curry,

1607
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:15,540
why would we not take that?

1608
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:16,380
God, what was I thinking?

1609
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:17,200
They're brilliant over there.

1610
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,540
You know, you just gotta watch and pay attention

1611
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:21,400
and just pick up a few lessons from time to time.

1612
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,380
That's true.

1613
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:24,420
Go get more Westpane over on the TechSnap show,

1614
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:26,180
TechSnap.Systems.

1615
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:27,500
He's also at Westpane.

1616
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,540
Why do I always doubt that?

1617
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:30,380
It's accurate.

1618
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:31,200
You're spot on.

1619
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,600
It's a pain with a Y, too.

1620
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:33,440
Oh, yeah.

1621
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:34,900
Like an action hero.

1622
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:37,100
Like an 80s movie actor, action hero.

1623
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:38,500
That's pretty much how my life goes.

1624
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:41,620
You're like the podcasting version of Hulk Hogan

1625
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:45,380
without the whole drama thing that happened with Gawker.

1626
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:46,200
Let's not bring that up.

1627
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,040
Yeah, let's not bring that up.

1628
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:47,960
All right, I'm at Chris LAS.

1629
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:49,980
You can follow me on the Twitter if you'd like.

1630
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:50,820
I don't really care.

1631
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:51,660
I don't use it a whole lot,

1632
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:53,300
but I do try to respond to tweets.

1633
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:55,420
So I try to be a good Twitter citizen that way.

1634
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:56,780
I'll also mention the Telegram group.

1635
01:04:56,780 --> 01:04:58,300
It's been quite a while since we've plugged that,

1636
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:01,420
JupiterBroadcasting.com slash Telegram.

1637
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:03,360
Go there and join the conversation,

1638
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:06,320
and every now and then a random host pops in there

1639
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:07,280
and starts chatting with people, too.

1640
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:08,120
It's pretty fun.

1641
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:11,120
And of course, we encourage you to join this show live.

1642
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:12,900
We do it on a Tuesday at 2 p.m. Pacific.

1643
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:14,500
You can get that converted to your time zone

1644
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:17,300
over at JupiterBroadcasting.com slash calendar.

1645
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:19,320
Now links to everything we talked about today

1646
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:22,100

1647
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:24,160
including the stuff for Project Stratus,

1648
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:26,580
and more information about Easel

1649
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:28,140
and their contributions to open source.

1650
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:29,660
Go read up about all of that,

1651
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:33,140
as well as the community news and bonus links in there

1652
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:35,980
that didn't even make it in the podcast.

1653
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:37,340
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode

1654
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:38,400
of the Unplugged program.

1655
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,640
Hope you can join us live next week,

1656
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:43,060
but if you can't, LinuxUnplugged.com slash subscribe

1657
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:48,060
for all the ways to get this show every single Tuesday!

1658
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:53,060
Wait!

1659
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:29,160
All right, 270 feels like a nice round one.

1660
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:30,660
Nice round one right there.

1661
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:31,660
Quality episode.

1662
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:32,980
It's really great.

1663
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:34,180
Thank you Andy for having you on.

1664
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:36,160
Great to get those questions answered in there.

1665
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,820
Now we just got to name this thing and then we're going to clear out for the Ask Noah

1666
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:40,980
program which is coming up on the live stream next.

1667
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:42,780
I've got a question for you Chris.

1668
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:43,780
Yes sir.

1669
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:46,820
Where's this review of the Precision Workstation?

1670
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:49,660
Oh I know I should have said something in the show.

1671
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:55,100
Well you see we have a particular kind of review scenario we're putting it through and

1672
01:06:55,100 --> 01:07:00,980
we're making a special episode that will be airing the week I go to meet BSD and so it's

1673
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:05,900
all part of a bigger episode so that's why it got delayed but I meant to bring something

1674
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:09,900
I meant to bring that up in the show because I'll give you a little preview that isn't

1675
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:16,420
directly related to the review but I decided 1604 is fine but let's put 1810 on there.

1676
01:07:16,420 --> 01:07:22,220
So I put 1810 stock Ubuntu on there.

1677
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:27,940
When I first logged in I sat there for a minute just taking it in.

1678
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:30,020
I'll have to show you that's what I'm talking about.

1679
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:41,460
The new theme with this screen is it's vibrant it like it jumps off the screen it is beautiful.

1680
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:45,100
I don't know what they're doing on this monitor and I don't know what's happening in that

1681
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:51,140
theme but I mean Mac OS and Windows don't have anything on this look it was so gorgeous

1682
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:56,580
and I don't know maybe I was having a stroke when I saw it but I couldn't believe how brilliant

1683
01:07:56,580 --> 01:07:57,580
and shiny it looked.

1684
01:07:57,580 --> 01:08:02,260
It just looked it looked the best I've ever seen Linux look on a 4k screen and it's just

1685
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:08,320
this edge to edge infinity glass you know on this 4k super nice monitor man I'll show

1686
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:09,320
you before you leave the studio.

1687
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:10,320
I'm excited to see it.

1688
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:17,740
It does it does look gorgeous I've been running it in a full screen VM on my XPS 15 with a

1689
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:21,660
UHD panel and yes it's striking.

1690
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:24,780
Yeah yeah this laptop's been fun.

1691
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:28,580
So we had to come up with a particular challenge for it just to kind of to kind of put into

1692
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:32,260
a workload that maybe somebody buying a machine like this would want so it kind of delayed

1693
01:08:32,260 --> 01:08:36,820
it because then we wanted to wrap it in with a wider subject so it'll come out but it'll

1694
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:42,300
probably be not next week but the week after because I'm going to meet BSD which is happening

1695
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:45,740
the weekend before that unplugged and then I'll be traveling home during unplugged but

1696
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:47,340
we'll have a show if all goes as planned.

1697
01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:52,860
Now that I've said that on air it's better it's better happen we have promised people.

1698
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:56,000
I do have good news we have bad news and good news it didn't quite make it into the show

1699
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,540
the bad news is is that a Chrome developer recently confirmed that they have no plans

1700
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:05,220
to enable hardware acceleration on Linux even when you go turn the flag on in the config

1701
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:10,900
settings it actually isn't hardware enabled it lies to you the flag is a lie it's false

1702
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:15,420
flag as Joey put it on OMG Ubuntu which did make me chuckle.

1703
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:19,460
And in his in his OMG Ubuntu article which I think we'll have in the show notes maybe

1704
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:23,060
make sure we have in the show notes for me would you mind I will look right now they

1705
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:27,320
have there is a there is a there are builds that do actually have hardware acceleration.

1706
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:32,740
So I when I saw that news I thought to myself well crud we're never gonna get that new game

1707
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:38,740
streaming tech that we just talked about last week on the show Linux users are out.

1708
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:47,100
However not more than eight hours ago I got confirmation from a listener who is successfully

1709
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:54,820
playing full screen 60 frames a second 1080p Assassin's Creed on his Fedora workstation

1710
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:59,940
using Intel graphics as part of the beta to the project stream.

1711
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:05,620
So it is doable he's got a more modern Intel chipset but it is doable he says it's taking

1712
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:10,060
about 20 megabits a second of his network so you do have to have a pretty solid connection.

1713
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:11,220
They mean it.

1714
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:16,580
But it it does look like this project stream from Google is playable on Linux.

1715
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:19,300
It might just all be happening on the CPU it might not be happening on the GPU.

1716
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:22,180
He's just got a beefing machine.

1717
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:30,740
But it's it's happening.
