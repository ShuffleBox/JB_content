1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,880
I'm just saying we might have an opportunity here,

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,000
because I guess the situation

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,460
with the Raspberry Pi availability in stores is so bad

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,100
that the Raspberry Pi Locator has been launched.

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,160
It's rpilocator.com.

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,080
Have you seen this, Wes?

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,280
No, I have not.

8
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,720
Yeah, so it's, I mean, it's as current

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,360
as of like a few minutes ago.

10
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,040
Oh yeah, last updated two minutes.

11
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,360
What?

12
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,880
Okay, Adafruit, that makes sense.

13
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,520
Yeah, and I guess it's just been so tricky.

14
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,660
It's getting a little bit better now,

15
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,800
but really with the chip shortage and everything,

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,580
people are having a hell of a time

17
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,880
finding some of these Raspberry Pis.

18
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,920
I mean, you can see like the Pi Zero sold out,

19
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,360
Raspberry Pi 4 with eight gigs of RAM is totally sold out.

20
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,120
Four gigs of RAM is totally sold out.

21
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,880
Some of these prices are kind of all over the place too.

22
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,760
You know, what's weird is the Raspberry Pi store

23
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,240
like just hit three years old, like a week ago,

24
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,600
and now they're launching three pop-up stores

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,280
where they'll be selling the Raspberry Pi 4.

26
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,840
But I'm looking at the inventory tracker here

27
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,120
and it says none are available.

28
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,640
So how did the store get the Raspberry Pis?

29
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,100
Hmm.

30
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,800
But you know what I'm thinking?

31
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,000
It's a business opportunity here for us.

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,560
I mean, you've got a few in your own back stock here.

33
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,560
Right?

34
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,160
We'll mark up the price, preload them with some desktop OS.

35
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,000
We'll call it Jupiter OS.

36
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,840
It'll make millions.

37
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:30,960
Hello friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

38
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,960
My name is Chris.

39
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,960
My name is Wes.

40
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,960
And my name is Brent.

41
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,680
Hello, you two.

42
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,940
Thanks for joining me today.

43
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:40,200
We have something a lot of fun coming up, I guess.

44
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,200
I don't know.

45
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,640
I think so.

46
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,560
Linux has really mastered the purpose-built computer.

47
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,440
And this week, we're going to chat with the creator of the $15 Linux box.

48
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,300
And really just kind of celebrate some of our favorite small little Linux computers.

49
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,280
It's an area where Linux is the absolute powerhouse.

50
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,060
And there is a new device in the works that looks so neat.

51
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:08,640
And then we'll round up the show with some great emails, our picks, and more.

52
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,360
So before we go any further, let's bring in our virtual lug.

53
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,360
Hello, Mumble Room.

54
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,360
Hello.

55
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,360
Hello.

56
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,360
Hello.

57
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,360
Hello, everybody.

58
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:22,280
You know, I got to say, 16 on Super Bowl Sunday is not bad.

59
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,280
Good work, team.

60
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,280
Am I allowed to say that?

61
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,280
Well, you just did.

62
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,280
So, yeah.

63
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,120
I hope we don't get in trouble for that.

64
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,960
But yeah, thank you guys for being here.

65
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,140
You joined us on a Sunday when we're doing the show live.

66
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,360
We start around noon Pacific.

67
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,360
That's right.

68
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,360
jblive.tv.

69
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,360
I was just trying to think, like, should I do all the math?

70
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,440
Should I try to go through the...

71
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,520
You know, you thought about this in the past, and you actually set up a website that helps

72
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,880
people figure that out for themselves.

73
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,880
A website.

74
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,880
Yeah.

75
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,680
And it does the calculation...

76
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,680
Robots or something.

77
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,680
I don't know.

78
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,680
I don't know how it works.

79
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,680
Huh.

80
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,600
We should set that up at like jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar or something like that.

81
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Yeah.

82
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,600
We'll get Brent to do it after the show.

83
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:04,200
I'm a little out of sorts because I did like a last minute slam and try on my Raspberry

84
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,200
Pi 400.

85
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,720
That's a technical term we use all the time at the show.

86
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:15,560
I downloaded the just recently released, get ready for this, Ubuntu Unity Remix for the

87
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,200
Raspberry Pi 4.

88
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,200
Whoa.

89
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,200
2204 edition.

90
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,200
Okay.

91
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,200
Yeah.

92
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,960
So it's basically a beta of 2204, and it's been rebuilt to run on the Pi, and it's the

93
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,700
Unity Remix.

94
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:34,080
And you'll probably recall, Wes, that Unity actually started life as the Netbook edition.

95
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,080
Ah, yes.

96
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,000
I even tried that Netbook edition way back in the day.

97
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Hell yeah.

98
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yeah, it was great.

99
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,960
It was just while on those tiny screens.

100
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,400
It does make me curious, though.

101
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,120
I mean, how did it perform?

102
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,000
Well, I have to say, the potential is there, but I don't think it's fully 3D accelerated.

103
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,440
I think it maybe is using some sort of LLVM pipe type acceleration, and that kind of kills

104
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,440
Unity.

105
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,600
So it's not super smooth, but it's as good as any other desktop for the most part that

106
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,840
I have had on there.

107
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,600
And there are aspects about Unity that hold up.

108
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,240
I really like that when I hit the super key and the app launcher comes up, I really like

109
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,600
that it doesn't take up the whole screen.

110
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,600
Oh, yeah.

111
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
I forgot about that.

112
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,880
It's just a classy looking window that comes up, and it memorizes which ones you use the

113
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,880
most often.

114
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,880
Yeah.

115
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,160
The other thing is they make it super easy to have the menu, like your file edit view

116
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,960
menu, they make it super easy to either have that be global up in the top bar or to have

117
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,540
it attached to each application if you want it displayed or not.

118
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:43,720
And what ends up happening with this 2204 Remix is you get some of the latest GNOME

119
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:49,680
apps from like the 42 release, but they have like menu bars and they just kind of operate

120
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,240
like they did maybe a couple of releases years ago.

121
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,240
That's a trip.

122
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,680
It was a nice mix and I could see it really working well if it had a fully 3D accelerated

123
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,680
experience like right now I hit the super key and the launcher is kind of a pop up.

124
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,680
Yeah.

125
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,680
Yeah.

126
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,680
Isn't that great?

127
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,160
And as you keep going, you've got a nice mix of a really nostalgic retro Linux workflow

128
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,840
that actually like the dock, that Unity dock is great.

129
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,840
I have to say.

130
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,840
Yeah.

131
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,840
I mean, they really got that right.

132
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,840
They did.

133
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,840
Just from the get go.

134
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,640
And you get that kind of stuff, but you get all the latest GNOME apps.

135
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,440
I mean, I kind of liked it.

136
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,160
You're getting weird with things, but I like what's happening.

137
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,560
You know, the other thing that kind of kills the Raspberry Pi is I'm using USB storage.

138
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,560
Yeah, sure.

139
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,600
You know, it's a little bit better on the compute module if you can use MMC.

140
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,680
But the storage is still kind of a pain point for that stuff, too.

141
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,680
But I liked it.

142
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,680
I like it.

143
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,000
I like it enough that I'm leaving it on there for now.

144
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,820
And maybe I can experiment with the 3D acceleration.

145
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:57,240
But there's a new way coming out for the Raspberry Pi still in beta to flash your storage.

146
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:03,280
So like traditionally, I don't know how you do it, but traditionally I download an image

147
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,720
and I will use either Etcher or DD.

148
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,120
If even in the past, I would use DD Rescue.

149
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,120
Sure.

150
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,600
And I'll write that image to a USB drive.

151
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,140
Not a SD card, but like a USB 3 SSD.

152
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,740
And then I boot my Pi with that.

153
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,040
But I think most people write it to an SD card or something like that.

154
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,040
Yeah.

155
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,300
Well, I mean, right, there was whole times where the USB boot didn't quite work without

156
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,560
the shim anyway.

157
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,560
Yeah.

158
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,560
Yeah.

159
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,360
Oh, it has gotten so much nicer.

160
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,520
And now they have an official Raspberry Pi image flash.

161
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,000
They've had it for a while.

162
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,660
But they're taking things to the next level.

163
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,440
And if you go get a new beta bootloader, which you have to flash the firmware on your Raspberry

164
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,680
Pi, but you go get this and it's only, I think, for the 4 and 400.

165
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,160
I've not tried this yet, but you get that new firmware installed on the Raspberry Pi

166
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,280
and you connect it to Ethernet in a monitor and power.

167
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:57,000
And if you press and hold down shift and then space bar at the prompt, that Raspberry Pi

168
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,560
will now do a network boot.

169
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,560
Oh, wow.

170
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,560
Huge dude.

171
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,560
Yeah.

172
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,560
That is a big change.

173
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,520
And I think something a lot of folks who deployed, you know, like yourself, who are deploying

174
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,320
many pies, that's killer.

175
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,320
Huge.

176
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:16,040
And you can then boot up to a network version of the Pi Imager app.

177
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,040
It'll host that.

178
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,040
Oh.

179
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,760
And then sitting physically at the Raspberry Pi, you can choose the OS you want it to flash

180
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,080
to the storage and you choose the storage medium.

181
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,240
And then it sits there and flashes it and then reboots and you're in the OS.

182
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,240
And depending on the OS you choose, like if you choose their OS, you can set things like

183
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,560
the Wi-Fi network to join to at reboot.

184
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,260
You can set SSH, change the root password before it ever boots up.

185
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,260
That's really nice.

186
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:43,080
I like too that maybe for like someone, assuming this gets out of beta, that was a little easier

187
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,080
to access.

188
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,640
I like the idea that someone who hasn't purchased a pre-installed setup, you know, just like

189
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,360
plugs in their storage medium, plugs in a, you know, there it gets their network going

190
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,080
and then they get this kind of nice setup to pick an OS and move forward.

191
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,640
I know.

192
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:02,480
And what I always like to do with these Raspberry Pi stories is do like a little thought experiment

193
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:08,560
and say, okay, so that's interesting, but what does this mean five years down the road

194
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,200
when the Raspberry Pi is even more powerful and it has even better storage and it's still

195
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,520
around this price point, you know, let's say it's around $60 on average.

196
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,180
What does that mean for a school?

197
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:26,000
You could have a lab full of these $60 computers and now you could have a TA go around and

198
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,560
reload the OSs or you could probably even automate it.

199
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,760
And so it's not just for guys like me who are doing home server stuff with our Raspberry

200
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:40,280
Pies, but I will think about like wide scale, like library deployments.

201
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,840
Imagine a computer lab at a library with $60 computers.

202
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,800
Like that doesn't take millions of dollars of funding to accomplish.

203
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:53,800
And when you make it as easy as, you know, hold down shift and then press the space bar,

204
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,320
like that's pretty amazing.

205
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,160
Like that makes it accessible to even just the library staff if they just had a checklist

206
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,520
of steps to follow and they could reload the machines.

207
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,520
Super exciting.

208
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,520
Yeah.

209
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,520
It does seem like a nice, nice amount of polish.

210
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,040
Do we know if you can customize the Netboot stuff yet?

211
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,040
I don't know the details.

212
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,040
I should try it.

213
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,120
So I think it's doing Netboot, but I don't know if it's just like straight up TFTP and

214
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,360
taking DHCP or if it's only talking to the Raspberry Pi Imager app.

215
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,960
So that would be something I would have to try.

216
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,960
Yeah.

217
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,960
This should be fun to play with.

218
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,960
Yeah.

219
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,960
It could be really great.

220
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,960
Yeah.

221
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,160
And there's a lot of things going forward.

222
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:32,120
So people out there have tried it, let us know at linuxunplug.com slash contact.

223
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,880
And then last week we saw the Raspberry Pi folks release the 64 bit version of Raspberry

224
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,880
Pi OS.

225
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,200
We talked about a little bit in Linux action news.

226
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,000
I can't effing believe it took this long.

227
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,280
So long, but you know, it happened.

228
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,560
I guess what they had some reasons around, we don't want to confuse the customers, but

229
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,440
also just compatibility, I guess, you know, because some of the older boards didn't, aren't

230
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,680
a 64 bit architecture and such, but all the new stuff, all the pies people are excited

231
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,680
about and talking about.

232
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,680
Yeah.

233
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,480
You remember how like just a little while ago they released a new version of their desktop

234
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,640
where they completely ported it to like a new version of GTK and didn't say anything

235
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,640
to anybody really.

236
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,640
And there's just like surprise.

237
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,640
I do remember that.

238
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,640
They don't operate the way most people playing in the Linux ecosystem operate.

239
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,640
No.

240
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,640
That's a good point.

241
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,600
And they don't move at the speed of open source.

242
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,560
They move at the speed of the Raspberry Pi.

243
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,560
Yeah.

244
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,560
It's a different type of organization.

245
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,040
They have a slightly different type of agenda.

246
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:31,840
I mean, I'm seriously like two years maybe into running Ubuntu 64 bit.

247
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,840
Yeah.

248
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,080
And they're just now getting their OS out.

249
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,200
It's strange too, because like if you dig around in there now, it no longer shows up

250
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,340
as a Raspberry Pi OS, but it shows up as Debian 11.

251
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,340
It's got Linux 510.

252
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,660
Oh, interesting.

253
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:52,400
So question, do you suspect that by switching Raspberry Pi OS to 64 bit, the performance

254
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,600
improved on the Raspberry Pi or was degraded?

255
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,800
Because you got to remember only a few even have four gigs of RAM or greater.

256
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
Yeah.

257
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,400
It's not like it's the most robust system ever.

258
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,400
Brent, do you have a guess?

259
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,760
Did the Raspberry Pi get faster or slower when they switched the OS to 64 bit?

260
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,680
Well my initial reaction is to say that surely they've run this 32 bit version forever and

261
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,640
optimized it for years.

262
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:21,480
So I would expect the code for the 64 bit stuff to be a little newer, maybe not optimized

263
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,480
as much.

264
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,440
So I would want to say the 32 bit one for now is a little bit faster.

265
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:31,320
But I don't know, I hesitate with that because obviously 64 bit is probably going to be way

266
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,760
better and there's a reason they're doing it.

267
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,760
So mixed.

268
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,480
I mean, it's just more numbers.

269
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,000
Doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be faster.

270
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
What do you think Wes?

271
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's just more numbers.

272
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yeah.

273
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,440
There could be probably some cases where maybe the 32 bit version has an edge.

274
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,680
But I would bet just with the way things have gone in the underlying kernel, you know, for

275
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,720
the past few years that the 64 bit ends up being the winner.

276
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,120
Well you guys are too clever.

277
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,600
So Michael Arbel did the benchmarks.

278
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,560
Ah, very nice.

279
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:04,680
And you're right Wes, in some small instances the 32 bit version was faster at a few things

280
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,680
like Brent implied.

281
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,200
It's probably because that's where it's been heavily optimized.

282
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,960
But on average, Larbel said 48 percent faster on the 64 bit version.

283
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,960
Wow.

284
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,960
That's huge.

285
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,960
Oh man.

286
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,440
Sort of makes it worse that they've waited so long.

287
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,440
I know.

288
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,720
And it's because, you know, the 64 bit code I think is in better shape.

289
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,840
I think there's some efficiencies that were gained.

290
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,440
I don't know ARM very well but I think there's like a difference and I'm sure somebody's

291
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,480
going to now give us a book.

292
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,680
But I think there's a difference between like they went from ARM 7 to ARM 9 which brings

293
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,880
in like a whole raft of efficiencies but I have no damn idea what I'm talking about.

294
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,120
But I can imagine that plays a little bit in there.

295
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,280
So okay, cards on the table now Brent.

296
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,680
You told us before the show that you had a bit of a Raspberry Pi confession that you wanted

297
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,560
to tell us and we don't know what it is.

298
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,560
No idea.

299
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,560
We've been waiting to find out.

300
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,640
Yeah I specifically didn't tell you because I don't think you're going to believe me.

301
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,720
But here's my confession.

302
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:05,920
I have never run or booted or played with a Raspberry Pi.

303
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,920
Period.

304
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,920
What?

305
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,920
Like at all?

306
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,920
Not even played with one?

307
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,920
No.

308
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,920
Not at all.

309
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,920
Wow.

310
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,640
I've certainly held a lot and seen you guys playing with them all the time.

311
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,480
You like lived in the RV.

312
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,480
It ran the RV.

313
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,240
Oh I know what they're capable of.

314
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,000
I certainly know what they're capable of.

315
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,080
But in terms of like in my own little home lab, you know, and diving in and seeing what

316
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,080
I can get out of it.

317
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,080
No.

318
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,200
I don't even have one in my place, which seems like I shouldn't even.

319
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,280
Why am I even in this room with you guys talking about this?

320
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,280
It doesn't make any sense.

321
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,280
Right?

322
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,720
Well, I feel like this is just a tremendous opportunity for the show.

323
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,200
We're going to have to capture Brent's first Raspberry Pi experience.

324
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
I'm going to think about this.

325
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,080
Can we start them on the one just so we can.

326
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,400
Oh my gosh.

327
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,680
I have one sitting in my home.

328
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,760
Is there still software for the one?

329
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,880
You could probably get at least something running on there.

330
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,960
I do feel like that'd be such a great way to appreciate the growth that this tiny little

331
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,360
$35 computers had.

332
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,520
And Grant, we're about to talk about a $15 computer in a moment.

333
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,240
Do you have any confessions, Wes, that you want to get about Raspberry Pi?

334
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,640
I'm not running one now.

335
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,640
I do.

336
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,640
I have plenty with them.

337
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:11,000
I have probably three or four sitting around my home in boxes that have been deployed before.

338
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,800
But it's probably been, I don't know, two years since I like really had one that was

339
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,540
actually running anything significant.

340
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:20,800
I noticed, Wes, you have one sitting in your entrance at your place, just kind of on the

341
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,800
shelf there.

342
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,800
Yeah, that's the one.

343
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,720
At some point I was trying to buy something and I obviously bought this at like two in

344
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,140
the morning or something and bought the one and forgot to return it.

345
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,800
So now it's just, yeah, now it's a display piece and now it has a point.

346
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,280
It turns out it was an investment.

347
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,720
You could sell it for a premium, you just didn't know.

348
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,720
All right.

349
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:45,240
So that's actually pretty understandable because really it took until the Pi 4 before I changed

350
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,460
the way I view the Raspberry Pi.

351
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,600
Everything until the 4 I just played with.

352
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,160
It was a toy just to see what can you do with something this cheap and this small.

353
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,160
Yeah.

354
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,200
Hey, look, that's the same Linux running over there.

355
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,200
Cool.

356
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,200
Why would I use this?

357
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:04,500
But as time has gone on and the Pi has gotten better and better, but also at the same time

358
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,460
the network effect has grown.

359
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,240
That's a huge factor for the Pi.

360
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,920
There's so many great small board computers for Linux, but nothing has a network effect

361
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,280
like the Pi.

362
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:23,520
It almost creates a Macintosh effect for Linux because everybody is targeting a common piece

363
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,520
of hardware.

364
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,600
If I tell you I have a Raspberry Pi 4 with 4 gigs of RAM.

365
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,960
You know exactly what that is.

366
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,080
You know what video card it has, you know what network chip it has, you know what GPU

367
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,080
it has.

368
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,240
It's as close as we get.

369
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,080
It's like a defragment to the Linux, micro Linux ecosystem.

370
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,200
And you could see the advantage of that as they get better and better.

371
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,040
What they've done now with the compute module, oh, I meant to bring it into the studio just

372
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,600
so we could look at it while we're talking about it, is so awesome.

373
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,560
It's such an impressive amount of compute on something that's so small.

374
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,600
It's smaller than a credit card.

375
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,000
It's smaller than the Raspberry Pi computer is normally.

376
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,080
And then I can put it on these boards that have all of this IO, including PCI cards and

377
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,880
all kinds of stuff.

378
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm testing one right now.

379
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,140
It's dual gigabit NICs on a Pi compute module and it's on the PCI bus.

380
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,920
It's really awesome.

381
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:22,040
And so what I realized is, number one, most people that are going to use a Raspberry Pi

382
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:27,040
are going to use it for something practical, a job, a project.

383
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,840
Not many people are going to use it as a desktop, right?

384
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,840
Not yet.

385
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,840
Right.

386
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,840
Because, as you mentioned, the network effect, right?

387
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,720
There's a lot of these pre-built images of stuff.

388
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,720
You want to try some hardware.

389
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,720
They're like, I'll just flash this thing.

390
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,200
Now you've got a purpose-built Pi that's just running whatever you're trying to play with.

391
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,080
And there's so many projects out there that are building self-hosted stuff that just has

392
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,720
a Pi image ready to go.

393
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:52,120
And that's, it's maybe one of the most important things that happened in Linux ever because

394
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,960
it's so accessible.

395
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:58,160
The price point is so accessible and it works so well with Linux, both because Linux is

396
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,880
free, but also because of its capabilities, its scalability, its unique design.

397
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,400
It's such a perfect marriage.

398
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,280
It both showcases and makes it a great place for Linux to run, but it also kind of nicely

399
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,560
hides the Linux bits, you know, because some of those other boards, they've gotten better,

400
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,600
but a lot of those are like, okay, we'll go figure out how do you get the software?

401
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,600
Do you have to build something?

402
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,320
Do you have to have the right kernel that works with this?

403
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,880
Or make sure you do this in grub so that it initializes this device correctly and it's

404
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,880
like, what?

405
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,880
I'm doing what?

406
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,880
Okay.

407
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,880
Which is interesting to me.

408
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,880
Yeah.

409
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,880
It's hard to learn on.

410
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,280
And these days it's getting to the point now where a lot of distributions are just releasing

411
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:39,800
an arm ISO, not an image, not a pre-built image, but an ISO that you just go grab and

412
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,360
do the regular install and it just works on the Raspberry Pi.

413
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:47,160
Between that, you know, USB boot support, network booting, like these are becoming way

414
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,560
closer to what we're used to thinking of as like an x86 PC.

415
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,560
Exactly.

416
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:59,040
And I think it makes, at least for most people, just such a perfect home server.

417
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:04,000
And there's things out there like Home Assistant that will turn it into an application

418
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,560
platform where you have a marketplace of apps, they call it a marketplace, they're all free.

419
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:15,760
Or projects like Umbral, which turn a Raspberry Pi into a Bitcoin node and has a bunch of

420
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,080
really high quality apps.

421
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,480
And these projects, they're like sound, they're Linux based, they're using containers in a

422
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,800
clever way to manage and update and secure and separate the applications.

423
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:32,080
The user experience is getting unbelievably good UI wise.

424
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,640
And it's amazing what this little Pi can do.

425
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,620
My Raspberry Pi at home, and I'll link to a couple episodes in Self Hosted where I go

426
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:43,200
into more detail, specifically Home Network under $200.

427
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,680
And also I would check out Crouching Pi Hidden Server.

428
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,680
Great titles.

429
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:53,000
Where what I do is, currently I've had more, but currently I have two Raspberry Pi 4s running

430
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,760
in my RV with some USB storage that's all butter FS.

431
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,840
And Home Assistant is probably the number one application.

432
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:06,520
And there's probably 300 different devices feeding into Home Assistant in this RV.

433
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,000
I mean, we're talking, it's a lot.

434
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,080
And then there's a series of automations that control lighting, heating, propane, things

435
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,760
that are just sort of like outside.

436
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:23,800
So like lights, noisemakers, these kinds of things, cameras, that kind of motion sensors,

437
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:28,560
temperature sensors, humidity sensors, vibration sensors, all kinds of stuff, right?

438
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,280
Then the damn thing also runs Plex.

439
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,840
So while it's doing, while it's managing and automating all of that stuff.

440
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,920
While it's running your life, it also.

441
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,940
It streams our Plex videos for us.

442
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:45,260
The other one, the other Pi is managing cameras and also runs a Pi hole in a container and

443
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:49,220
does DNS, DHCP, ad blocking for the network.

444
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,000
And I run those on two Pis.

445
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,160
I can run that whole rig off of solar because they just sip the power doing all of that

446
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,160
for me.

447
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,580
And honestly, it would be a little faster, Home Assistant, when I run it on faster hardware,

448
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,580
I notice a difference.

449
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,680
Yeah, sure.

450
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,640
Sometimes I compromise a little bit.

451
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,640
But for me, the appliance nature of it, the low power use of it, and now the horsepower

452
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,600
at the Pi 4, it's a pretty good compromise for me.

453
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,600
It really hits a sweet spot.

454
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,600
And I think most people would be surprised they don't need a huge x86 box in their house.

455
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,520
Yeah, you can get away with a lot on those things.

456
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,640
And that's where I think maybe it would be interesting to see what Brent does because

457
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:26,960
I mean, you're mobile, you don't always have full access to infrastructure, that's where

458
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,960
these things can shine.

459
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,760
Yeah, I've certainly been using laptops that I've found in the landfill to do very similar

460
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,760
things.

461
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,200
It's surprising what people throw out.

462
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,480
I've always kind of been like, oh, a Pi would be a perfect thing if only I had one, et cetera,

463
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,480
et cetera.

464
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,920
Chris, one thing I'm curious about is what do you hope the Pi 5 has that the 4 doesn't

465
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,920
have currently?

466
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:52,000
I always would like more CPU power, more GPU power and more RAM always, obviously.

467
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,040
But for me, it's 32 gig by Oh, God, I'd use it.

468
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,040
I would.

469
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,040
Yeah.

470
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,440
But for me, it's definitely at this point, disk IO.

471
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,440
That'd be the killer.

472
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,280
I'd love to not have my entire setup running on USB storage.

473
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,820
It's better with the compute module now.

474
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:11,620
And with the compute module, you can use built in eMMC storage.

475
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,200
It's only about 112 megabytes a second.

476
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,800
So it's not the fastest storage, but that's pretty usable for your OS disk.

477
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:23,720
And then I use the USB storage for like home or media content, but I'd love to see some

478
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,640
more options around that.

479
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,640
SATA would be incredible.

480
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,240
Oh, I'd love to know what people have done to address that.

481
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:36,560
I could see the compute module in a carrier board that has a PCI slot that I then put

482
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:41,640
a SATA controller into because the beautiful thing is, is once you get that compute module

483
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,480
into one of these carrier boards, and there's several out there, it's not what's compatible

484
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,080
with the Raspberry Pi, really.

485
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,720
It's more of, well, what works with Linux because it's just a Linux box.

486
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,980
And so if there's a kernel driver for it, I can go get a SATA controller now, plug that

487
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,000
in and use it with a Raspberry Pi.

488
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It's so cool.

489
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,600
I say it's kind of like the Macintosh of Linux boxes, except for you also have all the upsides

490
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,600
that it's Linux.

491
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,080
You can put any distro you want on there.

492
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,400
You're not restricted to one OS.

493
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,720
They don't lock it down to just Raspberry Pi OS.

494
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:18,220
And you get the power of the Linux kernel, which is tremendously more powerful than MacOS.

495
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,880
It's just such a great solution for our community.

496
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,360
And as it gets more powerful, I could really see people building laptops around these compute

497
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,880
modules and you get something like a framework laptop housing, and then you put your own

498
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,640
compute module into it.

499
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,640
I'd love something like that.

500
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,640
Right.

501
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,640
It makes it super simple to get started.

502
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,640
You just swap it up.

503
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,640
Yeah.

504
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,600
You just import in a laptop with a replaceable compute module, so every couple of years,

505
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,600
even if you can only do it for a little while, but yeah, you pop out the compute module,

506
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,680
you pop in a new one.

507
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,680
That's an attractive idea.

508
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,520
I don't know how practical it is, but boy, that would be cool.

509
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,320
Oh, I totally love it.

510
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,080
linode.com slash unplugged.

511
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,080
Is it unplugged?

512
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,080
Is that right?

513
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,080
Is that right?

514
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,080
Could you check it for me real quick, Wes?

515
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,080
Will you go there?

516
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,080
It's linode.com slash unplugged.

517
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,720
We got to make sure it's working.

518
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,960
Maybe everybody should check it real quick.

519
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,960
You probably should check.

520
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,960
Yeah.

521
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,960
Okay.

522
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,960
Welcome Linux Unplugged listeners.

523
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,960
Hey, that's me.

524
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,960
So that's all you had to do to support the show?

525
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,960
That's it.

526
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,960
Oh.

527
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,600
Well, you know, while you're there, you might want to sign up because you get $100 in 60-day

528
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,440
credit on a new account, and then you can really kick the tires with that.

529
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:22,520
That's some horsepower, Wes, to really try it for a while and form a genuine opinion

530
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,520
on it.

531
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,720
And you know, they got 11 data centers around the world, so when you become a traveling

532
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,960
man again, you could pick a data center that's going to be near you regardless, really.

533
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,360
Yeah, spin up a little personal VPN setup, get some local infrastructure to back up your

534
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,920
photos while you're traveling.

535
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:43,480
You know, they take extra care to make sure that they remain VPN-friendly, and that is

536
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,700
such a great use case for Nebula, too, to connect you between your machines or something

537
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,960
like TailScale in there.

538
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,960
Yeah.

539
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,960
Oh, man, it's so nice.

540
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,360
And you know, Linode systems are crazy fast.

541
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,040
Years ago, they became their own ISP.

542
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,040
How do you even do that?

543
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:00,960
I mean, I know it's a thing companies do, but it's not something like Jupiter Broadcasting

544
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,960
is doing anytime.

545
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,960
No, right?

546
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,920
I mean, that means you have to really know your stuff and have a competent staff who

547
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,040
can manage all that infrastructure.

548
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,040
Yeah.

549
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,880
Early on, we were using Linode pretty typically.

550
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,480
We were spinning up systems.

551
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,240
We were really just doing traditional storage, and that worked really well.

552
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,240
And the pricing's great.

553
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,720
The performance is great.

554
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,080
But then as time went on, we kind of started doing like, okay, well, this is going to be

555
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,200
a compute system, and the backend storage is actually going to be S3 object storage

556
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,720
because they've got S3 compatible object storage, and we started taking advantage of their different

557
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,000
setups, just experimented over time because it's really simple to experiment.

558
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,320
And we really kind of feel like we're Linode pros now, you know, and we just go right to

559
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,320
it.

560
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,320
Everybody knows how to use it.

561
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,720
I mean, part of that is we just like to go root around on the dashboard and see what's

562
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,960
new, see all the stuff that they can do for us, you know.

563
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,320
I mean, there's always something interesting to play with.

564
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,320
Yeah.

565
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,320
I was talking to our friends at Linode just recently, and they're working on a new service

566
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,360
that I will be able to tell you about soon.

567
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,360
Ah, not yet.

568
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,000
But there's just so much good stuff they're working on all the time.

569
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So what was it again?

570
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
It was linode.com slash unplugged?

571
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Slash unplugged.

572
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And you just did that real quick?

573
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Oh, in any browser, actually.

574
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Huh.

575
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Well, how about that?

576
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Even if you're not on Linux.

577
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
We should all do that.

578
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Maybe get $100, too.

579
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Sign up and go try them out.

580
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,520
And thanks to Linode for sponsoring the program.

581
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,920
It's linode.com slash unplugged.

582
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:23,520
All right, well, we were just waxing poetic about our love for the Raspberry Pi.

583
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,520
But really, I mean, between the modern Pis, between some of the stuff that's come out

584
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:33,680
from the Pine folks, there's a huge amount of really neat, powerful, cheap hardware out

585
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,680
there.

586
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,720
I mean, at least as long as you're not trying to buy a GPU or anything.

587
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,680
But this week, something new caught our attention.

588
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,640
The portable, minimum viable computer.

589
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,280
It's a Linux box for $15.

590
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:51,520
And Chris had a chance to sit down with the creator to find out how it works.

591
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,280
Well, Brian, thank you for coming on, because, you know, when I saw minimum viable computer

592
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,620
that piqued my interest.

593
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:03,080
But then, like, like some kind of headline title ninja, you managed to throw in there

594
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,680
or a Linux box for $15.

595
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,240
And my mind was just completely scrambled.

596
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,120
I had to stop and read this.

597
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,120
Headlines are an art.

598
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,120
They are, man.

599
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,120
You nailed it.

600
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,480
The New York Post is absolutely awful, but the headlines, right.

601
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,060
So it was a calculated move, but I think you must have gotten a lot of interest because

602
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:25,440
this showed up in so many different like feeds that I have and whatnot.

603
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,080
I think the idea resonates with people, a $15 usable Linux box.

604
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,900
I mean, yeah, it's not going to be amazing.

605
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,640
Tell me a little bit about your idea here.

606
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,280
As far as the why I can't answer that.

607
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,040
But what is the cheapest thing?

608
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,800
The minimal viable computer.

609
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:48,000
So I wrote for Hackaday, I know everybody that's doing electronic projects.

610
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,360
What is the minimal computer?

611
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,520
You can run Doom.

612
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,120
You can theoretically run Doom on a bunch of lights.

613
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,120
A smart bulb.

614
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,120
Yeah.

615
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,120
You want memory?

616
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,960
Well, you can make that out of a 555.

617
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,440
Those are really computers like, like, yeah, they compute.

618
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,680
But I mean, nobody's actually doing work on an Apple II now.

619
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:15,140
So for the entire super set of modern things that we do with computers, what is it?

620
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,140
That's the question.

621
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:20,000
I came down with the idea, okay, it runs Linux, just command line.

622
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
You don't need it.

623
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
You don't need a graphical interface.

624
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Right.

625
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
It's minimum viable.

626
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Yeah.

627
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,320
You can do all the computing that you usually do except for graphics and audio and whatever

628
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,520
in gaming with just command line.

629
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,520
Okay.

630
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,080
We need a keyboard too.

631
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,080
Okay.

632
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,920
And let's see, you need a small screen.

633
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,520
It doesn't need to be high resolution.

634
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,800
There's plenty of screens there.

635
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,280
You can just plug that into a spy port and it's fine.

636
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,280
Okay.

637
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,280
A battery.

638
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,280
That's it.

639
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,920
You know, put a USB port in there so you can plug in a wireless thing.

640
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,920
And you've got Wi-Fi.

641
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,640
You've got ethernet.

642
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,880
You've got a real keyboard.

643
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,880
That's it.

644
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,880
That's all you need.

645
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,880
So that's the question.

646
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,880
How do you design this?

647
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:08,880
Well, you need a Linux SOC.

648
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,880
Yeah.

649
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,880
All winners got one.

650
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,880
It's like 70 cents.

651
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,880
Yep.

652
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,880
Okay.

653
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:21,480
So Linux and then keyboard, which is the tripping point in any small computer thing.

654
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:28,600
Well, I did something with like silicone membrane keyboards, like in a remote control.

655
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:33,440
As an aside, how they make those, they take the silicone sheet, they CNC, basically a

656
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,880
waffle iron.

657
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,120
They run this silicone sheet through this waffle iron, close it and it vulcanizes or

658
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,120
something.

659
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,720
And you get buttons like a remote control.

660
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:49,960
So I actually built one of those for an earlier project and it's like, this is actually a

661
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:56,120
workable keyboard for a handheld thing and you don't need hundreds of tiny little parts

662
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,080
like you would in a BlackBerry keyboard.

663
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:04,440
It's like, okay, well, you can run that off like some GPIOs off the all-winner chip.

664
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:10,920
It's got USB already and you just get a spy display and that's it.

665
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,920
That's the hardware.

666
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:17,040
I mean, yeah, you're talking a 320 by 240 resolution on the display.

667
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:20,420
You're talking, you know, 533 megahertz CPU.

668
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:25,000
But again, if you're just doing the command line and using this to connect to devices

669
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,760
or something like that, send out some pings.

670
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,760
Yeah.

671
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,760
You know what?

672
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,080
You've got several versions of Linux to choose from too.

673
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:39,440
It may even be possible to run like, not mainline, but you know, five point whatever that we're

674
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,440
up to now.

675
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,440
Yeah.

676
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,280
How much pings do you think, you know, you look at the material, 15 bucks, but then there's

677
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,040
also time to put it together.

678
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,320
So maybe it's, how much really do you think it would cost to actually build this?

679
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,680
Break down the bomb would be 15 bucks.

680
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,600
That includes the battery.

681
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,240
That includes basically all the parts.

682
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:05,120
I don't know if we're doing nickel metal hydride or lithium yet, because if you do the math

683
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,320
on that, it kind of balances out.

684
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,580
In terms of price or capacity?

685
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:17,040
In terms of price with lithium, you get way better capacity and you're basically trading

686
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:21,880
ease of shipping for vastly increased battery life.

687
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,880
I see.

688
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,880
Okay.

689
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,040
So that's, that's the entire bomb.

690
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,360
Plus time to assemble.

691
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,360
Well, I would not assemble a thousand of these.

692
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,160
So you're thinking a kit maybe?

693
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,360
Not a kit.

694
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,560
I would have it assembled.

695
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:39,800
I know a few people, few board houses that would put this together and then after the

696
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:44,440
board is done, it's just popping two batteries and plugging in the screen and showing it

697
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,680
a case.

698
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:53,480
So that might be five to $7 to assemble everything.

699
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:59,120
All the parts, all the boards, you throw those through a machine and that adds like five

700
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,120
to $7.

701
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,120
So, okay.

702
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:08,060
Now we're up to 20 and you know, you got the margin on that plus shipping.

703
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:13,800
If you do it in quantity, it could be like 35, 45.

704
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:19,360
That's that's low, but it is a realistic number for what that could be.

705
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,000
I mean, it sounds like you've gotten a lot of people interested.

706
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Oh yeah.

707
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Yeah.

708
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,800
There's, there's still people pinging me on Twitter, trying to throw money at me.

709
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,880
What do people, do they suggest what they would use it for when, or you must've heard

710
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,080
some people what they think they would use it for.

711
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,080
That's actually a very good question.

712
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,080
And no, I haven't.

713
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,080
Oh, okay.

714
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:40,360
Which is really kind of weird.

715
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,160
I look at it and I say, this could be an awesome diagnostics machine.

716
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,920
Like you know, if you're a tech, you bring this on with you to a job site, or I look

717
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,840
at this and think this could be a great way to do network diagnostics because the thing

718
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,600
could just fits in your pocket.

719
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,600
Yeah.

720
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,600
I'd want several, have them all around the house.

721
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,840
What I kind of want to do is like, uh, the, the packaging is always a thing like, do you

722
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,840
do a box?

723
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,840
Do you just throw it in a bag?

724
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,840
Whatever.

725
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,840
I want to do like a blister pack.

726
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,840
There you go.

727
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,840
Yeah.

728
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,640
Like your go bag computer, right?

729
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:11,200
Like just something that's like emergency computer, good to go, sealed up, ready for

730
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,200
you whenever you need it.

731
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,200
Yeah.

732
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,760
It's something, it's something that you would find on, on just on a wall in the electronics

733
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,200
department on Kmart.

734
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,400
I can totally see it just like in the electronic section, it's up there in some sort of packaging

735
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,400
where it's on the hook.

736
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,520
You pick it up, you pop some batteries in and now you've got yourself a Linux computer

737
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,800
for 30 bucks.

738
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,140
I love it.

739
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,800
So how, how real is this going to be?

740
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,840
Like is this, uh, is this happening?

741
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:39,120
It's uh, I got some more boards coming from DHL, it should be here.

742
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:45,720
Well, they just landed in LA, so they might be here tomorrow or the next day, but gotta

743
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,720
get the circuit done.

744
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:53,640
Then yeah, then you go for funding, which I'm, I'm not sure if I'm going to do a crowdfunding

745
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,640
campaign.

746
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,640
Really?

747
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,640
Yeah.

748
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,640
Pre-sales?

749
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,640
What are you thinking?

750
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,160
My hope is that the next time you hear about this, they're for sale.

751
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,160
Uh-huh.

752
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,160
That would be refreshing.

753
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,160
That sounds hard though.

754
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,160
It's not hard.

755
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,160
It's just expensive.

756
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,160
Oh, okay.

757
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,160
I guess money solves many things, right?

758
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,160
Yeah.

759
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:15,560
But I mean, with the, with the interest of like, yeah, I can get rid of 5,000 of these

760
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,560
pretty quick.

761
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,560
I bet.

762
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,560
Yeah.

763
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,560
That doesn't surprise me.

764
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,560
Yeah.

765
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,560
Okay.

766
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,560
So you'll have to let me know so then we can put the word out.

767
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,560
Oh yeah.

768
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,560
Yeah.

769
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,560
Well, Brian, it's pretty rad.

770
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,160
We'll have a link in the notes.

771
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,440
So if people are interested in where this goes, just following you on Twitter, one of

772
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,600
the better places to stay in the loop.

773
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,600
Yeah.

774
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,600
Yeah.

775
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,600
Follow me on Twitter.

776
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,600
All right.

777
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,600
Well, we'll send people that way.

778
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,600
Thanks Brian.

779
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,600
All right.

780
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,600
That was great.

781
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,880
A couple of things to clean up around here before we get out of here.

782
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,320
Thank you members.

783
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:49,360
This is your moment in the show where I say thank you, unpluggedcore.com.

784
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:54,400
You get some of our best bits in the live stream or you can have a shorter, tighter

785
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,800
Joe produced ad free version of the show.

786
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,800
They're both good.

787
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,800
Yeah.

788
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,800
The Joe one's probably a little better though.

789
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,800
Yeah.

790
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,800
Yeah.

791
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,800
Yeah.

792
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,800
Yeah.

793
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,800
It's you and me screwing around most of the time or you and me and Brent screwing around

794
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,480
in the pre-show and the post-show and chat with the members, but that can be good too.

795
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,400
A lot of things do come up.

796
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,400
You can also support this show and all the shows by going to Jupiter.party.

797
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,400
That's all over there.

798
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,400
You get them in the feeds.

799
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,900
Hey, we like your feedback, your ideas.

800
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,400
We're trying to read them more and more trying to read every single message.

801
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,640
So send them in linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

802
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:29,640
Also the Luplug goes on Sunday before the show and it's Tuesdays when the show used

803
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,240
to be could, could be used to be.

804
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,800
You can just, just stop in any time.

805
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:38,160
Check it, you know, get the details at linuxunplugged.com slash mumble.

806
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,600
And for those of you who have been supporting the show with the value for value option in

807
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:46,560
the new podcast apps at newpodcastapps.com, we're going to do a live stream soon where

808
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,560
we read your boosts.

809
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,780
So if you want to support the show and send us a message you can do with the new value

810
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,780
for value feature.

811
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:56,320
If you don't know what I'm talking about, go get a new podcast app that supports value

812
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:01,520
at newpodcastapps.com.

813
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,120
Well we got some great feedback this week.

814
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,120
Thank you everyone.

815
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,120
Um, some was about rats.

816
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,120
Oh boy.

817
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,120
Thanks for that.

818
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:13,960
And mostly about, um, Ubuntu, which we talked in depth about Linux Unplugged episode number

819
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,960
444.

820
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:21,440
Um, Jimmy wrote in and said the Linux desktop is just one part of what makes Ubuntu, but

821
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,440
it's solid enough.

822
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,080
It doesn't need to be so edgy to attract users.

823
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:29,680
My guess is that Ubuntu realized this and puts focused where demand is strong and where

824
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,480
it can better allocate its development resources.

825
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,780
That matches up with my own anecdotes working for a university where I see Ubuntu excelling

826
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:43,880
in research, robotics, AI, machine learning, and in my own world of systems and networking

827
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:48,040
engineer where a lot of FOSS projects have strong support for Ubuntu.

828
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:52,360
Just look at Ubuntu's Twitter feed to get a sense of what they're trying to market.

829
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:58,080
And so I did have a look at their Twitter feed and guys, it's true.

830
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:02,680
Post number one was mentioned something about FIPS compliant Ubuntu servers.

831
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:07,040
Number two was like infrastructure automation with a secure on premises open stack cloud.

832
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,600
Why Ubuntu is the leading choice to replace CentOS for FinServe.

833
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,960
So I think he's sort of suggesting that maybe we missed a little slice of it.

834
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,960
What do you, what do you think?

835
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,320
I don't think what he's saying takes away from what we were saying.

836
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,320
I think it supports.

837
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,320
I think we agree.

838
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,320
Yeah.

839
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:25,840
It's a secure assessment, but more of that is, I guess the one part is how much they

840
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:30,040
should or want to be, or we want them to be focusing on the desktop, right?

841
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,200
He's basically saying, oh, there's all this other stuff they're doing.

842
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,400
And we're saying, well, yeah, there's all this other stuff they're doing.

843
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,920
Feels like they've taken their eye off the desktop.

844
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,920
Right.

845
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,920
And here's the results.

846
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,920
Whether or not you care about that.

847
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,920
Yeah.

848
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,920
That's where it, I think it comes down to opinion.

849
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,720
Well, and I think the other thing that I walked away from that episode thinking more about

850
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:49,080
it and I, I do have the sense that Canonical is doing something about it.

851
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:53,840
Like documentation, investing in documentation is a very public facing thing.

852
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,680
And it's a very, I think it supports the industries that just listed off.

853
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,480
Well, and especially for something that's, you know, such a dominant product at the moment

854
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,720
and where people are, you know, you already have some of that feeling of like, oh, when

855
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,680
I search for a problem on Linux, I'm going to get like a bunch of help and answers for

856
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,680
it.

857
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,680
And so the docs are also really good.

858
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,680
Yeah.

859
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,320
And this, I think this focus is paying off dividends in some ways too.

860
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,240
Like they have some of the best raspberry PI support of the distros of the desktop distros

861
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,840
out there.

862
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:22,440
You know, it made that Ubuntu Unity great because they've worked on that.

863
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,160
They've made that a great experience.

864
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,240
I walked away from the episode hoping that maybe we're seeing some signs though, that

865
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:33,720
they're also going to expand that focus to include making the desktop a little more compelling.

866
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,360
I don't know, but that's my sense of it.

867
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:40,960
There's like something in the works, but yeah, I think that was actually a very, a very astute

868
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,960
analysis, Jimmy.

869
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:46,900
I suppose there is also the element of, you know, we see the wider range of what's out

870
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,900
there as well.

871
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:52,040
So if you just, for those folks that Ubuntu works and you stick with it, I mean, I don't

872
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,120
think what we were trying to say is taking away from that it's not, that it's not a good

873
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,040
experience or like meets those use cases.

874
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,080
It's just that there's a lot of other interesting things going on.

875
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,080
Yeah.

876
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,960
Both Dave and Mike wrote in with similar ideas that maybe might be interesting to us.

877
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,240
Dave writes, the enthusiast base seems to want something akin to the Windows Insider

878
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,600
program or Arch for Ubuntu perhaps.

879
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,200
The latest features as fast as possible.

880
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:18,800
I know I want that, but I also know that waiting six months for an interim release of Ubuntu

881
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,880
is really what I need.

882
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,040
And so Mike wrote something similar.

883
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,520
He just says maybe canonical spinoffs of fedora like versions of Ubuntu with newer stuff,

884
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,120
perhaps an Ubuntu enterprise and Ubuntu desktop to come down the road.

885
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,640
Well, you kind of have that, right?

886
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:37,240
You have the interim releases and then you have the LTS releases and Dave touches on

887
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,240
it too.

888
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,240
People like really fresh stuff.

889
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:46,280
There have been different goes at like rolling Ubuntu based on the dailies, but they don't

890
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,920
really seem to last those projects.

891
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,920
Unless I'm wrong.

892
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:52,200
I think they've all kind of faded away, but you could in theory go get the latest dev

893
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:57,240
builds and just install all the updates from the repo.

894
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,480
And then write in and let us know how it goes.

895
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,800
I'll tell you it can't be any worse than rawhide.

896
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,120
Every time I try rawhide, it just blows up in my face.

897
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,300
What are the chances, right?

898
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,300
What are the chances?

899
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,160
I'm sure it works great for everybody else.

900
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:16,200
And for another last quick one, Advait wrote in and said, I'm a newbie using Ubuntu 2110

901
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,360
and it's great.

902
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,800
It does everything I want my OS to do.

903
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,480
I can easily set up my workflows just the way I want.

904
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,480
What's not to love?

905
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,240
The Ubuntu communities are great.

906
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,400
I get lots of support when I need it.

907
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,800
And unless I'm wrong, Ubuntu has the widest range of quality repos.

908
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,480
That's very important to me.

909
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,560
So clearly a lot of people are really happy.

910
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:42,720
I think what I got out of the feedback mostly was that some of what we've noticed Ubuntu

911
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:47,280
doing in the last, I don't know, several years, we could explain in words.

912
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:53,320
And some of it was just kind of this feeling that Ubuntu is changing a little bit.

913
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,640
Was that the feeling you guys got?

914
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,000
No, I mean, I think I could, I think I could quantify it pretty easily.

915
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,560
I mean, we saw them recently slip behind in the GNOME desktop in GTK when, you know, the

916
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,800
whole thing about going back to GNOME seemed like they were going to be shipping upstream

917
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,800
GNOME.

918
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,400
And I know they had issues getting the theme ready or the community did.

919
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,880
And so that was the reason we were given that there was, he wasn't ready for the Ubuntu

920
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,800
experience, but that's just another way of saying they didn't have enough engineering

921
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,800
time.

922
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:23,320
And I think we've also seen it just in the way recently the community has begun sort

923
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,320
of talking about everything but Ubuntu.

924
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:31,120
I think that was the big red flag for me is more and more Ubuntu isn't even a suggestion

925
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,840
for a distro for people to run.

926
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:38,520
And I can't believe that we have seen a shift to arch-based distros getting recommended

927
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,520
to new users.

928
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,080
I, you know, a year and a half ago sat here and said, nobody's doing that.

929
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,760
And then here we are, people are doing it.

930
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:50,400
And it's unbelievable how fast things have shifted in the last two years.

931
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,580
It seems to be an accelerating situation.

932
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:58,520
But also it seems the canonicals putting their foot on the pedal a little more.

933
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:02,460
I also do want to acknowledge, yeah, it works great still.

934
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,200
We have three Ubuntu systems in this room.

935
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,920
They work great.

936
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,240
Like I acknowledge that.

937
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,840
Yeah, I run Kubuntu every day on my system as well.

938
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,780
And I got to say for the most part, it runs great.

939
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,000
So we are huge fans, I think.

940
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,980
Yeah, I think it's more about the discontent you're seeing around snaps and the way that's

941
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:20,980
been deployed.

942
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:25,720
It's more about the adoption stats you're seeing, like for the Linux gamers that we

943
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:33,080
saw on the Steam stats and on the Proton stats that clearly show that Arch-based distros

944
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:39,160
are eating away at Ubuntu's market share at a just trend line that is continuing to only

945
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,140
go in one direction.

946
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:45,600
And then you also see it in our Tuxy stats when people voted, Ubuntu struggled to be

947
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:53,240
represented in any category where other distributions like Fedora dominated pretty strongly.

948
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,760
And that's a huge flip for our community.

949
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,880
I can't really overstate that point.

950
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,000
This show was even for a time possibly described as anti-Fedora.

951
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,440
I mean, that's kind of putting it harsh.

952
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:11,800
But early on, it was very critical of things that I felt weren't fully baked, but my opinion

953
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,800
was not static.

954
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,560
I mean, I changed it as the distribution changed.

955
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:21,020
And I think it's reflected in the community overall.

956
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:24,880
And I think when you look at who is driving the most important initiatives in the Linux

957
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:31,320
desktop, specifically from a development standpoint, a lot of that, not all of it, but a lot of

958
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:35,200
it's coming from Red Hat, especially lately, the past year and a half or whatever.

959
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:40,280
I mean, we saw a lot of ass kicking when Canonical announced they were switching over to GNOME

960
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:44,600
and then all of a sudden, boom, Ninja Patch, boom, Ninja Patch, boom, Ninja Patch.

961
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:48,960
It seems like that period of low hanging fruit or whatever you want to call it has passed.

962
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,920
And that's been very beneficial.

963
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,200
It's really helped GNOME be a much better project.

964
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,200
Yeah, definitely.

965
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:58,880
But when you're looking at things like PipeWire or other significant innovations that are

966
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:05,000
enabling things like NVIDIA to use Wayland or HDR support or high resolution, high frame

967
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,560
rate support, like that stuff's coming either from Collabra or from Red Hat or from a few

968
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,560
other outlets.

969
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,480
But Canonical's name isn't on there a lot.

970
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,480
Yeah, that's it, right?

971
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:20,440
Like, there are exciting developments in the Linux desktop experience and space.

972
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,940
And it feels like maybe Canonical's not necessarily keeping up, you know, so it's not saying an

973
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:24,940
absolute thing.

974
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:28,820
It's just like, we're paying attention to rates of change here and noticing Ubuntu seems

975
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:30,000
to be slowing down a bit.

976
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Right.

977
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,560
But if we shift the conversation to, okay, let's look at the Raspberry Pi.

978
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:37,480
Well, I would say, well, Fedora's catching up to where Ubuntu is on the Raspberry Pi.

979
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,480
Right.

980
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,220
Or just depending on your focus.

981
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:45,460
And that is, I think, what we were noting, because it used to be such a strong player

982
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,460
in that space.

983
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:51,600
There are, as you say, there are things, right, like the hiring about games, the documentation.

984
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:55,840
I know people have mixed opinions, but I honestly think that their interesting investment

985
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:59,600
in Flutter is at least a sign of them mixing things up and pursuing a direction.

986
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,080
So there's at least some thought involved.

987
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:06,840
Yeah, I feel like that's a mixed bag example, though, because it doesn't really benefit

988
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,840
anyone else.

989
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:12,600
Like if they were like, if they came out and said, we're rewriting our installer, and we're

990
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:18,360
doing the whole thing in GTK4, it's going to be a Wayland native installer.

991
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,000
How exciting would that be for us?

992
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,560
That'd be very exciting.

993
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:25,760
And I guess, though, I'm excited about the prospect of them being invested in making

994
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,760
Flutter a better experience.

995
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:27,760
Yeah.

996
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,360
Because I don't see, I guess I feel like there might be more future interesting apps in that

997
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:34,280
way than on the GTK4 side.

998
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:40,240
I would agree with you if a few years down the road, we start seeing a lot of must have

999
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,840
apps that are Flutter based.

1000
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:42,840
Yeah, that's fair.

1001
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:46,440
And if the investments Canonical made in Flutter make it a better experience on the Linux desktop,

1002
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,120
then I completely agree with you.

1003
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:52,140
But if we don't see that future, and it's just a few Canonical apps that are Flutter

1004
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:55,800
based, nothing beyond the Ubuntu experience has been gained.

1005
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:00,800
And the problem is, is that we can look back now at a history of Canonical, and we can

1006
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,360
see they don't stick with everything forever.

1007
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,360
This is true.

1008
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,200
They have reasons, reasonable reasons.

1009
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:13,000
But it means that when an innovation is limited to their ecosystem, it's also limited to the

1010
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,360
lifetime that Canonical wishes to invest into it.

1011
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:22,280
And that has proved long term not to be the best thing for me to invest into.

1012
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,280
You know what I'm saying?

1013
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,760
Like, kind of one of the reasons why I've kind of given in and everything's a flat pack

1014
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,520
now, even on Ubuntu systems, everything's a flat pack now.

1015
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,020
But I guess that to me speaks of a longer term issue.

1016
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:36,400
That's been the story of Canonical over the past decade, not just the past one and a half

1017
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,400
years.

1018
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,400
Yeah.

1019
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,680
So I guess I'm saying there's a return in that activity, but I think maybe the window

1020
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,440
where they were really on board with the Canome again, like that was more the exception, perhaps.

1021
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,440
Maybe.

1022
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,440
I see what you're saying there.

1023
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,560
And I could still see Flutter being a pretty smart investment on their standpoint, because

1024
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,880
Google is obviously heavily invested in that.

1025
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:53,880
But you're right.

1026
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:54,880
It is kind of a wild card.

1027
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:55,880
Who knows?

1028
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:59,240
It could very well end up being we tried two trial apps and then abandoned them.

1029
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,980
Yeah, maybe.

1030
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:04,160
Or they only ever ship on Ubuntu for as long as they're used to ship them.

1031
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,120
But anyways, we love the conversation.

1032
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:10,680
Thanks for getting us thinking Linux Unplugged dot com slash contact to send them in for

1033
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,180
next week.

1034
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:18,280
This is a pick out there for a lot of the mom and dads or people that are not mom and

1035
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,280
dads, I guess.

1036
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,480
But this is a way to get Minecraft easily working on Linux.

1037
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,760
And I say mom and dads because this is well, Dylan's actually been taking this over from

1038
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:27,760
me.

1039
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,760
It's kind of proud.

1040
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:29,760
But this has been my job.

1041
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,760
Right.

1042
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:33,360
Dad helps them helps all the kids get Minecraft working on their computers.

1043
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:39,480
And one of the problems with Minecraft is there is this whole world of mods and terms.

1044
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,840
And so your kid starts because their friends have them.

1045
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:45,320
So your kid starts asking you and you're like, I don't even know what you're talking about.

1046
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,340
This app helps manage all of that for you.

1047
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:49,640
And it's a brand new one because some of the other ones have begun to fade.

1048
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,840
It's got kind of a it's not a great name.

1049
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:52,840
It's called RPM Launcher.

1050
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:53,840
Yeah.

1051
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:54,840
I mean, you know what?

1052
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:55,840
I thought this was going to be.

1053
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:56,840
Yeah.

1054
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:57,840
Me too, actually.

1055
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:02,360
But no, it's a better Minecraft launcher that supports the multiple platforms.

1056
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:07,120
Like if you need certain mods and mod packs with certain versions of, you know, whatever

1057
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,680
they have all these names, it'll grab all that stuff for you.

1058
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:10,680
You'll get the right version of Java.

1059
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,040
It'll get the right version of Minecraft.

1060
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:15,160
It supports your Mojang or Xbox account if you already converted it.

1061
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,320
Well, it's all in and it's also available as a flat pack.

1062
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:22,160
So it's pretty easy to get set up on just about any freaking Linux box you want.

1063
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,400
And you know what else?

1064
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,400
Did you notice?

1065
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,400
I just did.

1066
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,400
All right.

1067
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,200
Tell the people it's written in Flutter.

1068
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,080
You see how it all gets tied together?

1069
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,080
That is.

1070
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,080
There you go.

1071
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,200
Isn't that great?

1072
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:38,440
And so as a result, it is also available as an app image, a portable binary.

1073
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:43,320
It's in the AUR and it's available for Windows and Mac and Snaps.

1074
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,320
Wow.

1075
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,320
This is really.

1076
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,320
You can get this thing anywhere.

1077
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,320
That's great.

1078
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,320
Yeah.

1079
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,320
So that is pretty nice.

1080
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,320
So there you go.

1081
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:54,240
For any of you out there that are struggling with Minecraft or even like for me, I went

1082
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,040
deep and it turns out that that time paid off.

1083
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,400
You're like a certified Minecraft administrator now.

1084
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,640
Hey, man, I can do mods.

1085
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,400
I can even help modify textures.

1086
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,400
Yeah.

1087
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,400
Oh, yeah.

1088
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,400
Yeah.

1089
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,400
Yeah.

1090
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,400
And you know what?

1091
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,040
I've converted multiple Mojang accounts to Microsoft accounts now because you got to.

1092
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,960
They're like forcing you to do it.

1093
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,280
Let me tell you what.

1094
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:16,920
But the one thing that kind of sucks that died off is there was a launcher for Minecraft's

1095
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,880
Bedrock, which is like the Windows only.

1096
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:19,880
Right.

1097
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:20,880
The newer one.

1098
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,120
And they made it available for Android.

1099
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:28,680
So some some brilliant person out there made this whole Android VM wrapper that downloads.

1100
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,680
You have to pay for it.

1101
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,680
Legit.

1102
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:36,320
It downloads the Minecraft launcher and runs it in Android VM totally transparently.

1103
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,320
Wow.

1104
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,720
But the guy burned out or they burned out.

1105
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:43,640
And so if anybody knows of a way to do that, let us know at Linux Unplugged dot com slash

1106
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:44,640
contact.

1107
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,880
Because that would that would that's the one thing that's missing now.

1108
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:48,880
Next level.

1109
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,880
Yeah.

1110
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,120
He's like, Dad, is it OK if I boot into Windows to play Minecraft Bedrock?

1111
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,840
My friends are, you know, that story.

1112
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,040
My friends are doing it.

1113
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,040
They're all playing Bedrock.

1114
00:48:56,040 --> 00:49:00,920
And I'm like, oh, all right, it's hard out there.

1115
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:01,920
It's hard out there.

1116
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,600
Hey, if you want more show, if you're missing some of the news, if you're in the industry,

1117
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,840
go to Linux Action News dot com.

1118
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:11,640
Wes and I are breaking down all the major stories in a concise, easy to consume way.

1119
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:16,360
We're not trying to not trying to get any hype, no click baiting, just what you need

1120
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:19,840
to know in the world of Linux and open source every single week at Linux Action News dot

1121
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:20,840
com.

1122
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:21,840
Yeah, you're busy.

1123
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:22,840
We get it.

1124
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:23,840
We'll break things down for you.

1125
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:24,840
We got you.

1126
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,640
So we'll be back on Sunday at noon Pacific.

1127
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:31,700
You can join us then or get it any time you like at Linux Unplugged dot com slash subscribe

1128
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:36,240
links at Linux Unplugged dot com slash four four five and we'll see you right back here

1129
00:49:36,240 --> 00:50:00,160
next Sunday.

1130
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:17,280
All right, let's go boat.

1131
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,840
Let's go pick a title here for this show, JB titles dot com.

1132
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:25,000
Hey, so what do you guys think about Discord and open source?

1133
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,920
I know this is a third rail conversation we've touched on before, but it's come up again

1134
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:33,360
recently in our community that perhaps we should consider consolidating our chat platforms

1135
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:37,480
and maybe Telegram isn't the right platform anymore and something like Discord that has

1136
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,520
individual channels is.

1137
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:43,160
And the nice thing about Discord is we could also pretty easily bridge it to our matrix

1138
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,160
system.

1139
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,240
Just a couple of rooms like the general chat.

1140
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,640
It's usually a pretty good experience.

1141
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,160
I have heard that is one of the better bridges.

1142
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,040
I've not tried it myself.

1143
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:55,640
So a reminder, Chris, that Discord is breaking bridges.

1144
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,240
Oh, what?

1145
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,680
We discussed this before.

1146
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,120
I completely forgot.

1147
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,880
Well, that's well, there you go.

1148
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,600
You know, this is the problem is there's a lot of there's a lot of community pressure

1149
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,800
to use Discord, but then these kinds of things happen.

1150
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:13,200
It's like how many times do we have to go through the lesson of a hosted platform that's

1151
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,500
not run by us?

1152
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,720
Always inevitably bites us in the butt.

1153
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:20,760
Technically, all bridges are against Discord's terms of service because you're not allowed

1154
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:28,160
to interact or interface with the Discord system through not a Discord client, man.

1155
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:33,720
So it's always been a little bit of a gray area or looking the other way.

1156
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:38,320
Yeah, they basically broke that by saying this API is going away in the beginning of

1157
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,320
April.

1158
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,840
All of your bridges are going to all your bots are going to break.

1159
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:45,760
I'm surprised to see Discord still going so strong in the open source community.

1160
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:50,480
It really it does seem like it's gained picked up a lot of traction is continuing to pick

1161
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,520
up traction.

1162
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:56,520
It depends on the subculture, really, like if they're if they're closer oriented towards

1163
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:01,300
gamers and entertainment and things like that, then, yeah, they tend to use Discord.

1164
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:06,880
But outside of that space, I've generally been seeing a shift towards using Matrix.

1165
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:07,880
Definitely.

1166
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:08,880
Seen more of that.

1167
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:09,880
Yep.

1168
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,680
It's frustrating how I mean, this is a problem in many things, right?

1169
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,240
Like so many open source projects, at least for a while, that seems to getting a little

1170
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:18,040
better by like using Slack, for instance, and having these closed effects.

1171
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,040
It's a network effect, right?

1172
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,640
Because you're already in Slack or you're already in Discord, so you can just join one

1173
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,800
more so easily.

1174
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,720
But boy, for the outsiders, not a great experience.

1175
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,920
I know I've seen a couple like I wanted to watch someone who's doing a live podcast recording,

1176
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,080
but they're only streaming on Discord.

1177
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,240
Like, I'm not I know signing in for that.

1178
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,240
Same thing.

1179
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,240
Same thing.

1180
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,240
I went now.

1181
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,240
No, no, no.

1182
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,240
Thanks.

1183
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,240
Yeah.

1184
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,240
I just want to I just want it on a Web page.

1185
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:43,440
Discord has a lot of specific features that make it nice for content creators, especially

1186
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:49,680
around the pivot streaming feature that allows them to do things like attach tooling to do.

1187
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:53,480
You know, when they do live streams to their YouTube or Twitter, even inside of Discord,

1188
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,080
they can do the reaction stuff.

1189
00:52:55,080 --> 00:53:01,080
They can trigger animations based on speech and other reaction type stuff.

1190
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:04,960
It's they're good, too, about like integrating with things like Patreon and doing perks.

1191
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:05,960
Yeah.

1192
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:06,960
Yeah.

1193
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,920
I don't really have any complaints about like the actual once you're in there.

1194
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:10,920
Yeah.

1195
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:11,920
Experience.

1196
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:16,160
There is an open source project that you can put on a Web page where you load the Web

1197
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,980
page and you can just start chatting.

1198
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:22,400
Something Wes and I've been talking about off air about something playing with soon.

1199
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,160
And that, you know, then it's really going to be what do we do with the IRC room after

1200
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,160
that?

1201
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:32,760
Well, the IRC room, if we have people who want our diehard IRC people, if you were to

1202
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:40,500
move that to, you know, Libera chat or somewhere else, then we can bridge that.

1203
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:45,360
And so it wouldn't matter if they're on IRC or if they're on Matrix.

1204
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:56,440
It's for people who like to mess with computers.
