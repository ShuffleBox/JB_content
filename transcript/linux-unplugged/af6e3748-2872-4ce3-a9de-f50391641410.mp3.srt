1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
Well, now that we're streaming video versions over on Jupiter.Tube, we clearly got up our

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:11,620
fashion game and Microsoft, well, they're stepping up with $150 tech pants.

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,160
You have to see this link in the show notes.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:20,060
It's the hardware designed just for the Xbox Gear Shop and they're really leaning hard

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:29,480
into the Windows XP retro look with big comfy sweatpants and sweatshirts and even $150 pants.

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,480
Sweatpants?

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,320
I think these are screaming your name.

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,720
Well, I mean, they are.

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:40,520
Let me just quote here, cargo pants are my go-to item as a creative, said creative director

10
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,960
Gavin Matthew.

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,420
And who can argue with that, right?

12
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:48,780
Like as a creative myself here making the show, I got to have a spot for all my gadgets

13
00:00:48,780 --> 00:01:04,080
and I really like to pay a premium to Microsoft while I'm at it.

14
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,280
Hello friends and welcome back to your fashionable weekly talk show.

15
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,280
My name is Chris.

16
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,640
My name is Wes.

17
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,840
My name is Fred.

18
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,240
Hello gentlemen.

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,880
We have a great show today.

20
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,200
We're comfortable in our pants and we're going to bust a myth.

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,760
Conventional wisdom tells us KDE neon just doesn't make for a great stable workstation.

22
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,160
You shouldn't use it as your daily driver, they say.

23
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,960
Well, this week we're going to see if we can debunk that myth.

24
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,280
We're going to put it to the test.

25
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,280
Maybe we do debunk it, but maybe we don't.

26
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,960
So you'll have to stay tuned for that.

27
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,680
Plus, I got my hands on the Steam Deck.

28
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,600
It's here and I've dug into it.

29
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,560
Does it make the ultimate portable Linux PC?

30
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,840
Will I be broadcasting from the road using my Steam Deck?

31
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,840
I'll share my thoughts on that.

32
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,200
And of course, we'll round out the show with some great boosts, our picks, and a lot more.

33
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,760
So before we go any further, let's say time appropriate greetings to our virtual lug.

34
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,760
Hello Mumble Room.

35
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,760
Hello friends.

36
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,760
Hey, howdy.

37
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,760
Hello Wes.

38
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,760
Hello Fred.

39
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,760
Wow.

40
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,760
Listen to that amazing crew we've got today.

41
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,440
We like to mention that we have the Mumble Room open with details at linuxunplug.com

42
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,440
slash mumble.

43
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,440
If you'd ever like to join.

44
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,480
We've got a quiet listening room if you just would like a high quality Opus low latency

45
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,080
stream and we have the on air.

46
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,760
We just do a quick mic check with you.

47
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,560
And then if everything passes, you can get on there and tag me in the chat room and get

48
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,560
your voice in the show.

49
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,300
Plus, it's a great time to hang out before and after the show too.

50
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,040
We're usually yucking it up with our Mumble Room.

51
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,320
Hey, I want to say good morning to Tail Scale.

52
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:41,260
Tail Scale is a mesh VPN protected by WireGuard's noise protocol.

53
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,640
This is what I always wanted to see happen with WireGuard.

54
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,640
We love it.

55
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,640
We use it.

56
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,300
It's going to change your game.

57
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:52,520
Go say good morning and try out Tail Scale for 20 devices for free.

58
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,560
Go to TailScale.com and if they ask, tell them we sent you.

59
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,000
Get it for free for 20 devices.

60
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It'll change your game.

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
TailScale.com.

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,760
Now, I want to just get a couple of items out of the way on the show skis before we

63
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,880
get into all the content because there's some big things that are coming up in the show.

64
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,480
I guess you could technically call this some housekeeping, but we wanted to get in front

65
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:20,080
of you that the London meetup is just around the corner, August 5th at 6 PM GMT local time.

66
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,160
We're so excited about it that Brent broke into Alex's house just to kind of, I don't

67
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,160
know, ride on the coattails of the meetup.

68
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,160
What?

69
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,160
It's true.

70
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,840
All his devices were going to be so lonely, so I thought I would have to keep them company.

71
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,240
Someone's got to keep Archie well fed.

72
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,240
Come on.

73
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,680
I think he's just there to drink all the fancy imported gin.

74
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,480
There may still be some donuts and whatnot from our last meetup, so you got to finish

75
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,480
those off too.

76
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:53,560
Then also coming up just around the corner, July 28th and the 31st is Scale 19X at the

77
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,640
Hilton Las Vegas Airport in Los Angeles, California.

78
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,260
You can get 50% off the already super cheap tickets by using the promo code LAS50, one

79
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,880
word when you get your tickets and you get 50% off.

80
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,280
Hilton Los Angeles, so it's real simple because it's at the airport.

81
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,640
It's July 28th through the 31st at scale.

82
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,560
I will not be going this year because I have a family trip at that time, but I will be

83
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,240
in California just a little bit after that, so if you're in the area and you would like

84
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,920
to say hi, you're going to have an opportunity because our West Coast tour dates have been

85
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,920
announced.

86
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,800
Of course, Linode is making it possible for us to go out and see the West Coast.

87
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,800
It's just time to do it, guys.

88
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,000
We've been to Denver.

89
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,240
We've been to Raleigh.

90
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,240
We're going to be in London.

91
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,200
It's time to go to the West Coast.

92
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,200
Here are the dates.

93
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,280
The meetup pages are rough.

94
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,240
They're minimum viable meetup pages, but we have a meetup scheduled in Southern Oregon

95
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,720
around the Grants Pass area.

96
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,080
Again, we don't have exact locations yet.

97
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,480
That'll be September 20th.

98
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:02,320
Sacramento in California on September 23rd at 6 PM, and then Southern California probably

99
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:09,000
in the Pasadena area near JPL after the JPL meetup, but that'll be a separate thing.

100
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,200
So there'll be an open to everybody meetup in the Pasadena area in Southern California

101
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,680
September 30th at 6 PM.

102
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,920
Then on our way north, we're going to stop by Portland, and that'll be on Friday, October

103
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,920
7th.

104
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,920
We'll be in Portland.

105
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:32,400
Grants Pass area, Southern Oregon, September 20th, Sacramento, September 23rd, Pasadena,

106
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,840
September 30th, Portland, October 7th.

107
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,440
What's not on here is Spokane or Boise.

108
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,680
We're going to attempt to make a trip out to that area at a separate time when I'm getting

109
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,440
some work done on the rig, at least to the Spokane area, so I'll have another meetup.

110
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,160
I'll announce for that.

111
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,920
Also not announced in this batch is the actual JPL tour.

112
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,320
We're going to do a lottery for that.

113
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,520
We'll have a way for you to fill out something that we can then run through and pull out

114
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,800
names for, and we'll probably pick a batch of people so we can have a few backups.

115
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,120
And I'll have that hopefully ready for you next week.

116
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,120
How about that?

117
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,120
Did I get everything out, guys?

118
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,120
Does that all seem clear?

119
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,440
It sounds like it's a real good time to just sign up for our general meetup page so you

120
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,820
don't miss any of this mayhem.

121
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,820
You got it.

122
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,720
And we also have that matrix room, and we'll put a link to that in there too, but we have

123
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,760
a West Coast crew where we're organizing the details on all of this.

124
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,520
We'll have a link hopefully in the show notes for that, and then you can get in there and

125
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,720
interact with us directly.

126
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,040
And then as these dates get closer, we'll become more and more active in that room.

127
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,080
We'll start coordinating more in there and getting specific.

128
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:40,120
As for the crew, guys, we're going to have an Airbnb down in Pasadena that'll fit about

129
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,720
six of us, so that's where we're going to stay when we get near JPLs.

130
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,080
We'll have another crew Airbnb.

131
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,080
It's got a hot tub.

132
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,120
It's got an outdoor seating area.

133
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,120
Can we have breakfast?

134
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,000
It's got an outdoor cooking area too, Brent.

135
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,080
The first thing I said is we're going to be doing brunch.

136
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,120
Live brunches for everyone.

137
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,160
Can we manage mics around the hot tub without any incidents?

138
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,160
Yeah, shotgun mics.

139
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,160
There you go.

140
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,160
Right?

141
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,160
You mount them a safe distance, shotgun in.

142
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,720
We've got a couple of those.

143
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,840
We could totally make it work.

144
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,360
So details will be up at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting for the London meetup

145
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,000
and the West Coast tour, and then later date for the Spokane area meetup, which will be

146
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,160
announced in a separate batch.

147
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,160
That's a lot.

148
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,960
And some actual Linux stuff.

149
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:29,000
We were going to come on the show today and talk about a really cool project that essentially

150
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,240
turns a Raspberry Pi into a remote video broadcast streamer, and you could use this for all kinds

151
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,240
of things.

152
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:42,060
Presentations, meetings, podcasting, a way to do video calls, semi-permanent video links

153
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,060
between two locations.

154
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,640
I mean, the list goes on and on.

155
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:53,120
The idea is a custom Raspberry Pi image and some plumbing under the hood using Gstreamer

156
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,040
and Python that automatically spins up GPU accelerated video streams.

157
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:03,240
And this was going to be Brent's remote connection this week, and it just didn't quite work out.

158
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,120
We spent some time last night troubleshooting and decided to scratch it.

159
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,760
And so instead, Brent had to spend the night and the early morning setting up a completely

160
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:21,000
different system, and we decided to take this opportunity to get Brent's renewed experiences

161
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,720
with KDE Neon, because I've been running it here on my system for years.

162
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:34,800
So I have a very long term look at KDE Neon, and Brent has a very early kind of first impressions

163
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,600
of KDE Neon.

164
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:41,180
And I think these are going to be two very interesting viewpoints to look at this distro

165
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,220
as a daily driver.

166
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:49,920
If you're not familiar with KDE Neon, its real primary feature is that it's super current

167
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,340
KDE Plasma desktop.

168
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,000
The dev team is on Neon.

169
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,880
They're releasing on Neon the day that a Plasma desktop update comes out.

170
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,960
When they announce it, it's out in the Neon repos.

171
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:07,320
It's based on a stable version of Ubuntu that they upgrade over time as major LTS has come

172
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:15,480
out, so you get a stable Ubuntu base, an LTS Ubuntu base, with a rolling Plasma desktop.

173
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,080
That's kind of like the special value pitch for Neon, and you can probably understand

174
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,340
why I like it for a studio machine.

175
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:25,000
So when Brent needed to build a system quick at Alex's house last night, and it was a desktop

176
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
tower, we said, well, let's talk about Neon on the show, because they're about to release

177
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,400
a brand new super fresh and polished version of KDE, and the best way to get your hands

178
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,200
on that kind of stuff is to use Neon.

179
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,400
Yeah, I'm also a huge KDE Plasma fan.

180
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:47,080
I have been for quite a while now, and I did try Neon, I think it's about three years ago

181
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,560
now when I was considering what to throw in my laptop.

182
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,200
It kind of back then just didn't quite work for me.

183
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,760
I was in a hurry, of course, and so I gave it a quick look.

184
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,800
Some of the updating was different, you know, they suggest you use not apt.

185
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,720
There's some other command that Chris, you might be more familiar with, and that just

186
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,720
like...

187
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,720
TKCon, yeah.

188
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,720
Right.

189
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,800
I would imagine there are some advantages to it that I'm not very experienced with,

190
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,000
but that just like was enough to just turn me off in that hurried state back then.

191
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,720
I'm not a huge fan of it either.

192
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,000
It rides on top of PackageKit.

193
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,520
They prefer you use it.

194
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,000
I think the general feeling there is that apt is starting to have some shortcomings,

195
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,040
but when you relayed that to me, I'm like, I totally know what you mean, man.

196
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,040
Here's what I do, right?

197
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,560
Because of course, of course I found a workaround, right?

198
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,720
Here's what I do is I do apt update, because you can still do that just to update your

199
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,640
package list.

200
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,080
And then when you do apt upgrade, it yells at you, tells you not to do it, and it actually

201
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,040
cancels, it cancels the command on you.

202
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,440
Yeah, that's a bad first user experience from someone who's used to Ubuntu, right?

203
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,440
Nobody wants that.

204
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,360
To be clear, to be clear, not meant for first user or anyone who's not ready for a system

205
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,400
like this.

206
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,400
I'll take that back.

207
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,140
I don't think I'm a new user, but I'm a new user to KDE Neon.

208
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:03,000
And so there was a nice message there, but I played with it for like 15 minutes trying

209
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
to get it going.

210
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And I just couldn't.

211
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,520
And I was like, nah, I'm gonna look at something else.

212
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,940
Now, I'm not saying do what Chris does.

213
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,960
You're giving Brent advice to like get him into trouble before he's even got a chance

214
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:18,020
to install it the real way, or deal with like any of reading the docs or...

215
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,120
Job one, always log in as root.

216
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,120
That's what I do.

217
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,120
It's fine.

218
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,120
Just fine.

219
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,280
You don't need to be on a private IP either.

220
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,920
Just go and get yourself a public IP.

221
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,920
It's fine.

222
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,040
If you can, sort of rejigger your system so X is running as root as well, and get rid

223
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,280
of Wayland if at all possible.

224
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:38,320
And I think the best case scenario for performance, always run your Docker daemon as root.

225
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,640
Make sure it's always good to go.

226
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,960
No, actually, what I really think you should try, because it's been fine for me, even though

227
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,720
don't do this, but this is what I would do.

228
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,400
You do an apt update, but then do apt dist upgrade.

229
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,480
And if you're doing a dist upgrade, then it doesn't yell at you about using PKCon.

230
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,480
And it does everything you need anyways.

231
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:03,440
I mean, it does mean you'll upgrade your distro on accident, maybe, but that's fine.

232
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,600
You know, I bet you the wonderful folks at KD Neon are now thinking, oh, geez, we got

233
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,600
to fix that.

234
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,600
So that comes up with the message now.

235
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,600
Yeah, I know, right?

236
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,160
They're going to write a note, be like, no, guys, you really don't want to do that.

237
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,240
I was going to say, or, dang it, they're talking about us again.

238
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,880
Yeah, that too.

239
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:22,640
But when I told you that, that gave you the peace of mind to proceed and try it.

240
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,760
I'm assuming it went flawless after that.

241
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,480
As all things do, right?

242
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,480
Yeah, just to give a little background for those who don't know that I'm actually at

243
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,480
Alex's place.

244
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,880
Alex is not here.

245
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,200
That presents a few interesting challenges.

246
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,120
One of them being I don't have all of my normal setup.

247
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,480
The other being an advantage, which is I have all these gadgets to use that I can, you know,

248
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,440
add to my new workflow for the next month.

249
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,100
However, I quickly learned that even if I'm surrounded by a bunch of gadgets doesn't mean

250
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,960
necessarily that I know how they're all connected and even where the power buttons are on some

251
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,160
of these things.

252
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,200
And so it was interesting, but he's got this lovely tower over here that I thought surely

253
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,900
it should do something more useful than only running Windows.

254
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:07,200
And so he was kind enough to tell me that there was an SSD in there, totally blank,

255
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,520
that I could just throw neon onto.

256
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,940
So I thought we should do that.

257
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:17,840
One of the, I think, hesitations I had, and you both made me feel better about this, was

258
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:24,480
the last few times I've installed Linux Ubuntu specifically aside a Windows installation,

259
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,360
it's kind of messed with some of the bootloader stuff and was problematic.

260
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,960
Now I have no evidence whether or not I did screw it up.

261
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,360
We're going to find that out later, but that was one of my hesitations.

262
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,720
So at first I was thinking, you know, I took the case apart, opened it up and I was like,

263
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,920
I'm just going to unplug the serial ATA cable.

264
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,680
But that I think is a, an indication of the type of hardware I'm used to, which is not

265
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,880
exactly super modern hardware, because I had the case open and I was like, there's no cables.

266
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,060
It's all just M.2 drives and stuff.

267
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:02,000
So I figured I had to do it some other way, which is perhaps more risky.

268
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,120
So I gave it a shot.

269
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,920
So I'm just in the BIOS now.

270
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,160
Thankfully I figured out how to use this keyboard.

271
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:16,200
It's got like a bunch of modes to switch to different, I guess, Bluetooth devices or whatever.

272
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,600
So I finally got the keyboard working after figuring out how to get the monitor working.

273
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,720
How it is when you're not with your own things.

274
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,240
And now I'm seeing a Linux boot manager being reported here.

275
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:34,560
So I'm wondering if that SanDisk, that extra SSD, oh, it's a Samsung SSD.

276
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,560
Okay.

277
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,560
So the SanDisk is obviously my USB drive.

278
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,560
Interesting.

279
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:44,760
So I'm only seeing one of the SanDisk's listed here, but there's two entries for the Linux

280
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,800
boot manager, which is very interesting.

281
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:53,160
So I wonder if there's already a Linux on there anyways, investigations.

282
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,920
I wonder, are you seeing in there maybe an entry from a previous install that Alex had

283
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,920
on that machine?

284
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:03,200
I was thinking it might've been that, but the partition manager didn't like show anything.

285
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,040
It showed just like no file system at all on that SSD.

286
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,960
I would assume he wouldn't do that.

287
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,960
He's Alex.

288
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,000
So he would fill a drive as soon as he bought it, but could be, could be.

289
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,640
That has since vanished because of course I've made some progress.

290
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,780
But when you're on a new system, you got to kind of poke around and hopefully not screw

291
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,780
things up.

292
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,060
Ghost in the firmware.

293
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:26,280
But I was able to eventually, you know, get things set up properly in the BIOS and make

294
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,080
a little bit of progress.

295
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,080
Okay.

296
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:34,080
I was able to figure out the boot priority, which is great.

297
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:40,720
So I'm booting off my little USB drive that has the neon image loaded onto it.

298
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:49,160
And UEFI, it complained that the system was shut down many times unsuccessfully.

299
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,160
I don't know what that's about.

300
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,000
And this is the first time I gave it a try.

301
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,420
And so I got the neon boot menu, which is great, a grub menu, which is great.

302
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:04,740
So just selected, you know, let's go for it.

303
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:09,920
And now I was hoping this would figure itself out while I was recording this, but now it

304
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,680
is just a blank screen.

305
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,120
This is not feeling very good.

306
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,200
So more work to do.

307
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,560
Oh, that doesn't seem like it went well.

308
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,080
Blanks green.

309
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,520
I'm sure some of you are like, Oh yeah, of course.

310
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,720
It's like, this is probably exactly what happened.

311
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,580
But it kind of made me realize that I've been working with mostly laptops for the last like

312
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,280
five years and not very fancy ones.

313
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:38,240
So I knew, okay, well that's obviously I can just give it a shot in safe graphics mode.

314
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,480
But then I had quite a blank on where to go from there.

315
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,200
So anyways, I tried the safe graphics mode.

316
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,560
I think we have some partial success.

317
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,380
I suspected it might be a display issue.

318
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:56,120
This display is one of those big, massive, fancy curved ones.

319
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,480
And so I'm currently booted into the safe graphics grub option.

320
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,520
It doesn't look great on this monitor, but it's working.

321
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,160
So hello neon.

322
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,160
All right.

323
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,640
I mean, at least you got a desktop, I suppose.

324
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,960
But it's like got to be super, super tight on that safe graphics mode.

325
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:20,860
It was like 1024 by 768 totally stretched into this like why super wide landscape mode.

326
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:25,440
It was, it still made me feel good because I was at least, you know, able to do some

327
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,440
things.

328
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,960
But man, after a little bit of just watching them, my eyes were getting a little squirrely.

329
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,400
I like the idea to you install, you go to the trouble of installing a distro to get

330
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,680
like the latest and greatest that KDE Plasma has to offer just to also experience it in

331
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,320
the lowest possible resolution in 2020.

332
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,360
Well, yeah, that's a thing, though.

333
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,960
That's not a great experience.

334
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,520
And I wonder, is it a combination of just maybe monitoring graphics card where just

335
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,300
needed more advanced feature sets than what the free stuff offered?

336
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,940
That's just not a great experience for you out of the box.

337
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,240
I would say it wasn't.

338
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:03,240
Thankfully, I am not new to running into sort of issues at first, right, especially on hardware

339
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,200
I don't know very well.

340
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,560
So it's a bit of a Matlock situation, you know, trying to ask, okay, well, what part

341
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,320
could it be started level one, you know, is it a is it plugged in?

342
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,880
That's pretty important.

343
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,780
So not new to kind of troubleshooting in that way.

344
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:24,280
But it was a little disconcerting because I was on a deadline, was feeling a little

345
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,400
bit of stress to get this thing going.

346
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,280
Considering I was gonna, you know, this, this machine is primarily its use case is going

347
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:34,520
to be recording the podcasts and streaming some of the video that we do on the stream.

348
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,920
So it's gonna be pretty important.

349
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:41,820
I finally at least got that video going, but I did start running into other problems.

350
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:46,880
And of course, just as I get things booted up, the mouse dies.

351
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,200
And I need to figure out a way to recharge the battery.

352
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,800
It's got I think a USB C port on it.

353
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:59,240
And I'm looking here and there's a desk full of a great many cables.

354
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:07,800
We have pies plugged in and audio interfaces and hard drives and so many things.

355
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:15,520
I can't seem to find a USB C cable and now I'm starting to feel pretty stressed.

356
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,200
Oh, man, that's frustrating when it's like, I'm just trying to get this thing online.

357
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,640
I got a live stream to do and I can't now my mouse has died that that actually happened

358
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,440
to me yesterday when we were going to jump on our call my mouse died.

359
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,120
So I now have just a little cord that hangs off my launch keyboard right here that I just

360
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,200
plug the mouse into.

361
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,480
But you know, off to your I think it's your left there.

362
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,480
Alex has a USB.

363
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,720
No, your other left.

364
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,880
Alex Alex has a USB C cable run along the side of the desk there.

365
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,580
Oh, where you're sitting.

366
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,100
So there's a cable over there.

367
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,840
I pulled a lot of cables in trying to get all this working.

368
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,340
So I don't know what's happening.

369
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:55,880
I know because I had my devices plugged in there when I was there when we were in Raleigh.

370
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,560
So I have the same problem.

371
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,720
He's gonna get back and everything's gonna be so different.

372
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,680
It's gonna take you the rest of the trip just to like, put everything back in working order

373
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,680
for Alex.

374
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,760
Oh, don't put it back.

375
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,080
You know, I will say he's got a great setup.

376
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,480
There's a lot of cables like neatly tucked and just poking out a little bit so that you

377
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,880
could plug them in for this kind of use.

378
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:22,440
However, like this one over here is a USB B. This one over here is a Thunderbolt one.

379
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,240
And so I just anyways, I was I eventually found one way over there.

380
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,480
And so it had like, two or three dongle like connectors to make it work.

381
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,480
But I figured it out.

382
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,200
I got the mouse charging.

383
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:42,640
But then I ran into you know, that risky part of like how not to wipe all of Alex's stuff.

384
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:49,600
Okay, I think I'm just gonna try and install from this safe graphics mode.

385
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,600
That feels a little risky, but I'm starting to run out of time here.

386
00:20:54,600 --> 00:21:03,980
So I'm gonna try that in the installer, I can see there is an SSD 970 Evo plus two terabyte,

387
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:08,460
and there's an SSD 970 Evo Pro 512.

388
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:16,480
And from what the installer is suggesting, the 512 says just free space, that seems exactly

389
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:24,160
like what Alex described, and the two terabyte, or nearly suggests that there's an NTFS partition

390
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,160
on there.

391
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,960
So that seems fine.

392
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,960
Still feels risky.

393
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,360
I don't want to screw up this machine.

394
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,480
It's not mine.

395
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:37,640
And I'm sure I don't know what Alex's backup state is like.

396
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:42,800
So I'm gonna do a little bit of extra investigating, see what I can find out.

397
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,800
You're very generous.

398
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,120
I just assumed, oh, he left this drive for me, I just want to go on to town.

399
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,660
I have a great story about one time I was trying to fix someone's computer and they

400
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:56,080
were running Outlook and Outlook was like maxed out because back then...

401
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,600
No, the PST file could only hold like two gigs or something like that.

402
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,120
Yeah, you know exactly this one.

403
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,320
So it was a boss of mine at the time and I was young, I was like 16, and I was like,

404
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,740
oh, that's an easy solution.

405
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,360
You have like two gigs, well, it wasn't two gigs, you have like, you know, 500 bags worth

406
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,560
of stuff in your trash, so I just deleted his trash.

407
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:20,240
And then, so this was my boss at my very first job at a gas station and he said, you didn't

408
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,240
delete my trash, did you?

409
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,820
And my heart sunk, I said, well, I did, I just figured that would be an easy way to

410
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,820
clear some space.

411
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,160
He said, that's where I keep all my stuff.

412
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,160
Wow.

413
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:37,240
So then I spent several hours trying to get it back and I didn't, thankfully.

414
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,240
Wow.

415
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:46,800
So what he taught me, don't just trust that a standard workflow is okay, so, you know,

416
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,800
be extra cautious with other people's things because you never know how they use their

417
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,800
computers.

418
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,800
Just didn't trust folders?

419
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:58,800
That's why I keep, you know, I keep my fresh produce in the compost because the fridge,

420
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,280
it just doesn't work.

421
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:05,200
Well, there's a nice quick like shortcut key for the trash, you know, to move things to

422
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:11,320
that folder quickly, so it seems convenient, but anyways, I did a little bit more poking

423
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,800
around and things seemed fine.

424
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:18,440
So in my hard drive investigations, I've discovered some things.

425
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:28,160
There is, I guess, a boot partition and the OS, I believe on this Toshiba 1.75 terabyte,

426
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:33,920
which is not any of the SSDs I just mentioned, I suppose that's fine.

427
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:39,480
The other thing is upon looking at the smart properties for this guy, it reports a temperature

428
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:48,000
of a minus 273 degrees Celsius, which, if I'm not mistaken, is just about zero Kelvin.

429
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,920
So he's got some pretty amazing cooling in this thing, I think.

430
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,920
Wow.

431
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,240
Yeah, that's some great cooling.

432
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,800
It's this modern technology, right?

433
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,680
All right, so maybe the smart data is a little off.

434
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,680
I'm sure it's fine.

435
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,680
It's fine.

436
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:05,320
I was at least happy to find, you know, the boot partitions and stuff that I was expecting

437
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,320
previously.

438
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,320
I wasn't finding that.

439
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,320
So then I was like, I'm just going to go for it.

440
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,120
I'm really, really running out of time now.

441
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,640
And so I did some installing, but then I realized I got to solve this graphics thing.

442
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,320
There's no way we're going to be able to do some streaming with this crazy graphic situation.

443
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,720
So I had to call you both up.

444
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,720
Call a friend style.

445
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:30,720
Okay, well, I've called in the team.

446
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:39,000
I have zero experience with, let's call it premium hardware, or at least getting some

447
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,280
Nvidia graphics to work.

448
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:45,200
So I've called in, I'm calling a friend, Chris and Wes.

449
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,080
And so far, they have many suggestions.

450
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,200
So I'm going to try a whole bunch of those.

451
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,200
Stay tuned.

452
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,640
Millionaire style, call a friend.

453
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,600
And then we began to pepper you with suggestions.

454
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,000
It's true too many and so many and they were all great.

455
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,720
However, I did discover that there was some disparity between the tutorials you were sending

456
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,640
me and KDE neon, which turned out to be interesting.

457
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,640
Right.

458
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,640
All right.

459
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:21,360
Well, you know, it's Ubuntu base, but it doesn't have all the same KDE neon, right?

460
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:27,920
And thus, some of the tutorials that Chris is sending me don't apply that easily.

461
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:32,200
But Wes did suggest running Ubuntu drivers auto install, and that might just kind of

462
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,200
take care of it.

463
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,360
But we were worried that it wouldn't install the non free driver.

464
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:42,760
So I was able to run Ubuntu drivers auto, no, sorry, Ubuntu drivers devices, which lists

465
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,120
the what it's going to do.

466
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:51,440
And it's suggesting the Nvidia driver 515 distro non free recommended.

467
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,480
So I'm assuming that will install the non free one when we run auto install.

468
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,480
I'm hoping it's going to work.

469
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,840
So I'm going to try this now.

470
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,240
I'm glad you were able to catch that and didn't just end up installing the free driver, which

471
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,720
is probably what you already had.

472
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,680
Yeah, that was your suggestion, which was a good one, because I think not knowing that

473
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,300
I wouldn't have known what to look for.

474
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,400
So that was a good tip on your hip.

475
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,160
But the key thing there, it sounds like, is to realize that neon doesn't ship with the

476
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,860
Ubuntu drivers tool.

477
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,860
That's it.

478
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,860
Yeah.

479
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:23,440
And so I suppose I could have found the graphical drivers tool and installed it.

480
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,800
But it seemed, you know, just as easy to go the west route.

481
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:31,680
This is I just I like to just kind of zoom in on that, because, A, it's nice to know

482
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,180
there is a command line way you can do it and you don't need the graphical tool.

483
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:42,320
But B, that's exactly the kind of thing like exactly that I would have missed in my review

484
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,080
of neon, because I installed that two years ago, three years ago.

485
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,520
I don't know how long it's been, and I just completely forgot that it doesn't come with

486
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,620
neon anymore because I just sort of solved that problem.

487
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:59,640
That's really kind of the interesting difference between a new eyes review and a longtime review,

488
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,320
because I can tell you, oh, yeah, there's ways to fix that.

489
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,320
And it won't be a problem long term anymore.

490
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,360
Like once you've solved it once, it's done right.

491
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,480
But it's good to know that some of those things you depend on, even though it is an Ubuntu

492
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,040
base, doesn't necessarily have by default.

493
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,040
Yeah.

494
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,080
And that's one place where you can get caught is, you know, if you if you know enough to

495
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,320
know it's an Ubuntu base, which is fine.

496
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,760
Going out and looking for a bunch of tutorials might not necessarily give you the solution.

497
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,980
So I mean, that's kind of what you get with using a distro that's a little bit niche and

498
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,240
that's fine.

499
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:36,040
But for me, I think playing with some more high end graphics, you know, NVIDIA stuff

500
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,280
was new to me.

501
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,600
So thankfully, I had, you know, two mentors to guide me through that.

502
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,040
And it was relatively painless.

503
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,200
Without that, I think I would have struggled a little bit more.

504
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:51,760
So but anyways, after that, I was able to get first boot going and found some success

505
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,760
trending again.

506
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,960
Okay, we have first boot, which is really great.

507
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:04,360
Now I am just running that driver as a pseudo Ubuntu drivers and stuff.

508
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,240
Let's see how that goes.

509
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,240
Command not found.

510
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:13,720
Oh, oh, I mistyped it.

511
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,480
I'll report back in a sec.

512
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,480
Oh, look at you.

513
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,880
Oh, I can hear a little Archie in the background, too.

514
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,880
Hey, Archie.

515
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,880
Oh, yeah.

516
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,920
He's, you know, a companion and keep the spirits high.

517
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,960
You need someone to give you good advice.

518
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,360
This means all three of us are podcasting with dogs.

519
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,640
We should change the name of the show.

520
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,800
And change our video shots to probably right, they should be the dogs.

521
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,800
Right.

522
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:40,040
So after installing the graphics drivers and doing a quick reboot, everything was perfect,

523
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,560
turned out really great.

524
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:48,120
But I did start to run into a few other issues that seemed maybe less software based, maybe

525
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,760
a bit more hardware based.

526
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:56,800
You know, this is mildly embarrassing, because it seems obvious now, but we have lovely graphics.

527
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,680
And then I was thinking, oh, no, all I see is background.

528
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,760
But it's extending to the left.

529
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:08,680
And so obviously, this other monitor is also connected to this computer.

530
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:13,800
So I just need to figure out how to turn that one on.

531
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,600
We'll get there.

532
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,440
But anyways, yeah, welcome to a modern brand.

533
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,440
You're set up now.

534
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,960
You got a big, powerful workstation.

535
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,720
You got your fancy screens.

536
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,640
You know, I thought it was going to be obvious because I have one monitor here in front of

537
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,640
me and another one to the right.

538
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,320
And I was like, oh, yeah, OK, well, you know, it's just not quite, you know, the default

539
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:37,760
setup is not quite so instead of being on the left, it's on the right.

540
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,800
But it wasn't that obvious because I brought up the, you know, the display manager.

541
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,280
You could drag them around and stuff like that.

542
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,500
And it wasn't even this monitor.

543
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:48,560
It was the TV over there in the other side of the room that was plugged in.

544
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,560
Oh, Alex.

545
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:53,040
And it was set default as my primary monitor.

546
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,560
So all my toolbars and stuff.

547
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,560
I love it.

548
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:59,080
You could be podcasting from the couch right now and you're not.

549
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,080
Missed opportunity.

550
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,800
Put the chat room on the TV.

551
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,800
That's what you do.

552
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,800
Right.

553
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,640
So anyways, I traced a few cables and got this other one plugged in and unplugged that

554
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,640
TV and everything was just fine.

555
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,440
Oh, good.

556
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,440
And now you're going to, I guess, probably get to know neon a little bit, really.

557
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,720
It's just get to know plasma.

558
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,480
It's just it's the latest plasma.

559
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,480
That's it.

560
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,840
Yeah, I did find a bug or two, as I may, that were pretty minor, but we'll see if we can

561
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,640
report on those in a bit.

562
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,720
But I'm excited to give this a tour for the next month.

563
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,020
I think so far it's quite performant, really working nicely.

564
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:36,760
And I mean, as a plasma fan, having modern plasma is just a treat.

565
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:43,720
And I'll point out, if you were on an AMD hardware stack with a GPU or an Intel hardware

566
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,120
stack, especially for graphics, right now, you wouldn't have had that that reduced graphics

567
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,120
mode.

568
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,120
You wouldn't have had that GPU issue.

569
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,480
It's also not your hardware, right?

570
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,240
So probably if you had like, oh, I bought a new graphics card and I'm going you would

571
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,520
have had like a period where you expected that you were going to go through this troubleshooting

572
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,520
where you just kind of just jumping in with like, I don't know what I have or how to make

573
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,520
it work.

574
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,480
Yeah, it was kind of all of the mystery all at once, for sure.

575
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:12,360
So I'm going to be interested to hear your thoughts in a few days, even not to mention

576
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:18,280
a few weeks on what it's like using it ongoing, because you're on the precipice of 526 getting

577
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,280
released.

578
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:23,200
It's a pretty significant update, lots of nice things in there, at least.

579
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,240
They've been crazy smooth for me.

580
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,560
The biggest problem I've had in the last few years using KDE neon on this machine that

581
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:33,480
I use practically daily, I use it six days a week is like, you know, every now and then

582
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,520
after an update, my background wouldn't load.

583
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,360
That seems minor, but it works great.

584
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:42,400
And I keep it up to date fairly routinely, but I'm not super religious about it.

585
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,720
I fall behind sometimes and it still does just fine.

586
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,800
The experience of using KDE neon is the experience of using plasma.

587
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,600
It doesn't feel like a distro with a brand.

588
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,380
It doesn't, it's not, I mean, it almost doesn't even feel like a distro.

589
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:59,360
It feels like a, it's a meta desktop in a way.

590
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,680
It's, it's Ubuntu with a, with a rolling plasma environment.

591
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,920
I don't think it's even fully a distro necessarily.

592
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,920
Yeah.

593
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,200
And you get that because like tutorials and stuff now, Brent, you ran into some, some

594
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,080
issues there, but to Chris's point, at least with like a longer live system, usually once

595
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,220
you've kind of got a little more of the, your base system built out, like it, it, you forget

596
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:21,600
that you're not on a standard Ubuntu release for the most part.

597
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,600
Totally.

598
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,600
That's exactly, that's a good way to put it.

599
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,320
It's like, once you get that stuff figured out, it's just going to run like, like an

600
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:32,240
Ubuntu LTS would, only eventually they'll also roll it to the newer LTS.

601
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,600
I've gone even crazier and I've done things like now I have that Ubuntu tool that lets

602
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,960
me install my own kernel.

603
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,520
So I have like the absolute latest Linux kernel too, and that kind of helped with performance

604
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,520
on my machine.

605
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:46,640
But I think you're really going to enjoy it, at least I hope because I know you like plasma.

606
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,720
And so I think you're really going to like this because it's, I think it's a really good

607
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,360
presentation of where the plasma desktop is going.

608
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:58,720
And what's nice about this is you can see where they're at right now today.

609
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,100
Like when I talk about my Steam Deck in a little bit, well, the version of plasma that's

610
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:07,880
on my Steam Deck was technically released in October of last year, had a security patch

611
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,880
in January.

612
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,560
So it's been updated as of January, but the major release came out in October.

613
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:21,320
And so there's just stuff missing in their plasma image that my desktop has right now.

614
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,600
And it's nice to see where they're going because there's so much work being done on the plasma

615
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,600
desktop.

616
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,760
And it's such an awesome workstation OS.

617
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,320
I'm almost positive it's what we're going to use as our desktop environment when we

618
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:35,400
redo all the studio machines now, all our production machines, I think will be plasma

619
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:39,280
in part because I just love Kwin and I love the Kwin rules.

620
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:43,240
That's very true.

621
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,480
Linode.com slash unplugged.

622
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,320
Go there to get one hundred dollars and sixty day credit on a new account and you can go

623
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,200
there to support the show.

624
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,480
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting, the Linux Geeks Cloud.

625
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,840
We've been using it for, oh my gosh, can I almost start saying three years now?

626
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,480
I got to do the math on that.

627
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,320
I love Linode and I think you will, too.

628
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,920
I have had friends who've been using it for a decade.

629
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,240
They've been around for nearly 19 years.

630
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:13,320
They are fast, reliable cloud hosting with 11 data centers around the world.

631
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,240
Linode is great for performance hounds, for those of you that want a great value, for

632
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:21,640
people that want a back end infrastructure for their business or just an individual's

633
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:26,920
website, a portfolio, a blog with pricing 30 to 50 percent cheaper than the hyperscalers

634
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,720
out there that want to lock into their crazy platforms.

635
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,720
You're going to love it.

636
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,040
And with that hundred dollars, you can really try it.

637
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,920
And that's the difference.

638
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:38,320
Linode recently rolled out Kali Linux support so that way you can test your security.

639
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,360
And of course, they always have the absolute up to date distributions, including the latest

640
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,880
Alma, Rocky and others.

641
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,280
They'll even let you do a custom install a couple of times now.

642
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,000
I've had to just take it down to the metal and install a custom distro once for a crazy

643
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,240
VPN solution and once to install NixOS, which I mean, doesn't feel so crazy.

644
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,320
And if you ever run into any troubles, you ever have any problems getting set up, they

645
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:07,380
have tons of guides, tons of tutorials, but also Linode comes with amazing 24 seven customer

646
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,560
support by phone or by ticket.

647
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,040
You're going to get the help you need.

648
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,160
And they also have a really large community, including lots of members in our community.

649
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:20,320
In fact, Linode is invested in the Jupiter Broadcasting community multiple times over

650
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,760
and they're doing it once again this year by making it possible for us to go down and

651
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,920
visit JPL.

652
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,160
And we're not the only ones they support.

653
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,520
Media and free software Linode support runs deep in the community.

654
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,780
In fact, that's how I first discovered them.

655
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:37,160
They were making it possible for Texas Linux Fest to go.

656
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:40,320
Linode is dedicated to offering the best in virtualized cloud computing.

657
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,640
If it runs on Linux, it'll run on Linode.

658
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,920
Go see why we love it.

659
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:49,400

663
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:09,360
Chris, I was wondering if you have done one of those LTS updates on that install yet and

664
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,360
how that went.

665
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,360
Yeah, it went fine.

666
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,360
Really.

667
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:17,280
I don't recall any significant issues twice or so.

668
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,720
I have had problems with like bootloaders getting messed up from an update like the

669
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,680
update failed during the bootloader image generation process or something like that

670
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:30,560
where I have had to go in and repair that.

671
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,280
And I don't actually think that's a neon problem.

672
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,680
I think that was an apt issue.

673
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,680
And the machine itself is so old.

674
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:42,680
So yeah, I've had a few package updates break on me and I don't really think it's neon so

675
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,680
much.

676
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,000
I was just checking and I just did an L.S. on Varlog installer, which is a directory

677
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,760
that the Ubuntu installer leaves on your hard drive.

678
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:55,380
And the files in there were created January 29th, 2018.

679
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,440
That's when I installed this machine.

680
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:03,160
So the fact that twice I've had to like go fix my boot manager after an upgrade failed,

681
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,160
that's not so bad.

682
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,840
I've almost always universally done them from the command line, too.

683
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,800
I may have done one upgrade from the GUI.

684
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,320
There was one update where they added new upgrade notifications.

685
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,920
And so that time I upgraded using the GUI, but otherwise all other times I've just upgraded

686
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,440
from the command line.

687
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,880
And you complain about a lot of broken stuff in the studio, but it's not it's not usually

688
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,880
that machine.

689
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,880
Right.

690
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,920
And of all the things that are breaking, it is generally not the neon machine.

691
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:33,440
I will say, Brent, probably you probably will find more bugs than maybe you used to on a

692
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,040
more, you know, like on a more static release.

693
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,040
Oh, I'm used to finding quite a bit.

694
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,480
But the difference with neon is that instead of it being like, I've suffered with this

695
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,320
bug for the past six, nine, three years or whatever.

696
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,840
In a few weeks, you'll notice like, oh, if it got patched in the latest point release,

697
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,840
then it's gone.

698
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:53,060
You might have a new bug to replace it, but it feels fresh in that way.

699
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:58,800
Or put another way, Brent could actually file a bug against an issue he found and he could

700
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,120
see the results of that more immediately, right?

701
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:06,920
It's an opportunity for QA in chief to actually contribute a little bit to the plasma desktop

702
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,920
if you have time, because that's actually the team that's fixing these problems.

703
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,960
Yeah, that feedback loop is actually really helpful because I've certainly filed a few

704
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,160
bugs in the past and, you know, made sure I was as up to date as I possibly could be

705
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,160
on that system.

706
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,240
And then the developers just being like, oh, yeah, we fixed that weeks ago.

707
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,640
You just got to wait.

708
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:31,800
So I'm looking actually quite a bit forward to this to continue my journey of being more

709
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,240
involved in open source projects.

710
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:37,120
I think this is actually a perfect way to continue those contributions.

711
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:41,480
Well, that's enough of Brent's hardware struggles.

712
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:45,120
I think we need something of maybe a hardware success story.

713
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:50,000
And you, Chris, you, my friend, you've been waiting patiently for something I thought

714
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,320
might never arrive.

715
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,880
I was bracing for November.

716
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,880
You know what I mean?

717
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,680
I told myself mentally that my Steam Deck wasn't going to arrive until like November.

718
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:05,020
What is so crazy about the timing, Wes, is the night that the Steam Deck arrived, another

719
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:08,360
device just showed up that's been missing.

720
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:14,240
The original Nvidia Shield portable here, which was essentially a controller with a

721
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,760
clamshell screen that ran Android.

722
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:23,400
Actually an awesome device, pretty powerful for the time, came out in 2013, almost nine

723
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,080
years ago.

724
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:29,320
And they last updated Android on this in 2016, which the servers are still online.

725
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,400
You can still get the latest update.

726
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,480
I had to do it because the thing sat in a box for five years.

727
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:38,160
This was my favorite portable machine at the time because it could sideload your favorite

728
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,160
emulators.

729
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,240
You had access to the Play Store.

730
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,920
You had access to Nvidia Shield streaming.

731
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,160
And it's legitimately a pretty fast Android device.

732
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,400
I mean, at the time, right?

733
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,000
I mean, that's about the closest thing you get to a portable Linux gaming device for

734
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
a long time.

735
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Totally.

736
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,200
It absolutely was.

737
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,040
And it was great for what it was.

738
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,040
I loved it.

739
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:01,120
And my son and I, we'd love to play this, you know, retro games on this and all this.

740
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:05,760
This was by far one of my favorite portable gaming devices of all time, this Nvidia Shield

741
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,760
portable.

742
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:10,600
I'll put a link in the show notes if you're not familiar with it.

743
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:17,680
What are the chances that the same day I get my Steam Deck, a device that's a 2022 take

744
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:22,660
on kind of the same idea, what are the chances I get that at the same time I rediscover after

745
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:26,840
five, six years, we find the Nvidia Shield in a box?

746
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:31,800
And what a unique opportunity to look at two ends of this spectrum at the same time.

747
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:36,720
And I'm going to tell you, there is a couple of things that the Nvidia Shield still does

748
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,720
better.

749
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,280
I'll tell you what they are in a moment.

750
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,000
And of course, there's things that obviously the Steam Deck does better.

751
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:49,640
That's kind of a given since the Steam Deck has essentially an HP Dev1 crammed inside

752
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,640
of it.

753
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,640
So it's not surprising.

754
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,640
Sure does.

755
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:58,760
Yeah, it's got a 1280 by 800 IPS screen with 400 nit brightness, gorgeous screen, four

756
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:07,140
core eight thread AMD Zen 2 CPU, which has an eight core AMD RDNA graphics card with

757
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,040
one gigabyte of dedicated memory.

758
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:14,640
It's got 16 gigs of system RAM, and you can either get it with 64 gigs of eMMC storage,

759
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:20,240
256 of MVME, 512 of MVME, which is the one that I have.

760
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,240
Oh, baby.

761
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,240
I had to go big, right?

762
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,240
I got a lot of games.

763
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,040
And then 40 watt hours of battery life.

764
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:31,000
I'll put a link to the iFixit teardown in the show notes if you're interested on like

765
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,920
the, you know, the guts of this thing.

766
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,840
Out of the box, feels really high end.

767
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,600
It's lighter than I expected, but I have held one before, but it still actually surprised

768
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,600
me when I took it out of the box.

769
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,560
It comes with a nice carrying case.

770
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:51,760
Overall just it feels like like if you bought a Nintendo Switch, I'd say it's even a nicer

771
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,320
experience than buying a Nintendo Switch.

772
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,940
Device setup is super smooth.

773
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,480
They've nailed it.

774
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,000
I had a little bit of a software update I had to do right away, but it updated quick.

775
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
It rebooted.

776
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,440
I was in the new OS pretty quickly, and then it took me only a moment to switch it to the

777
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,880
beta channel because, of course, I did and did another update, rebooted.

778
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,880
I have to say, I really like the UI that they've come up with.

779
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,120
It is not big picture mode.

780
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,680
It's something different, and I really I think it's pretty great.

781
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:24,840
It is super easy in that UI to determine what games work good on the deck and which ones

782
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,840
are a little sketch.

783
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,880
So you're going to have a good time.

784
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:32,760
Undoubtedly, one of the nicest things about it, while I'm talking about positive stuff,

785
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:38,200
is that if you've bought a Steam game before, you've already got games that work on it.

786
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,880
When you buy a Switch, there's no games on it.

787
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,800
When you buy another console, there's no games on it.

788
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,600
When you buy a Steam Deck, you got your entire effing Steam library.

789
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,600
That's pretty great.

790
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:54,480
Plus, it even has your save points if your games support Steam Cloud.

791
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:59,920
So I launched a game on here, and it was right where I left off when I played on the PC like

792
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:00,920
three months ago.

793
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,720
I mean, that's a great experience.

794
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,600
That really, especially, you know, you've already paid a bunch of money for these games.

795
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,960
Now you've invested in a brand new hardware thing.

796
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,640
You're kind of wanting to make sure you get your value out of it.

797
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,640
And I think you do.

798
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:17,320
They also have, in Steam, in the Steam big picture mode, whatever that's called.

799
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,960
I know they have a name for it, but you know, their new big picture mode.

800
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,060
They also have Chrome that you can install.

801
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:27,680
So even if you don't want to drop to desktop mode, you could just use Chrome in the big

802
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,120
picture mode, which is kind of neat.

803
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,120
It's full Chrome.

804
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:34,100
Like I went to Linux unplugged and everything, and it worked.

805
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,120
So that's the big picture mode.

806
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,080
I think you could probably find lots of people to talk about it.

807
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,080
You've probably heard the game reviews.

808
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,920
Of course, it plays games fine.

809
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:41,920
It's a 720p screen.

810
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,440
I mean, I put almost all my games on ultra mode, and they played just fine.

811
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:51,240
Some of my impressed, though, at some of the nicest, fanciest Windows games are actually

812
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,920
running just fine on the deck.

813
00:43:53,920 --> 00:44:00,080
And then like old games, like I just played Age of Empires on this thing, and it did great.

814
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,040
It worked great for playing Age of Empires.

815
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,560
The trackpads, you get used to it.

816
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,000
They're not so bad when you're gaming.

817
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
You have lots of options.

818
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,600
You have every input option under the sun, including the touchscreen, which you end up

819
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:10,600
using a lot.

820
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,600
Oh, really?

821
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,600
Yeah.

822
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,600
Yeah.

823
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,760
Especially when you go to desktop mode.

824
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:18,400
So let's talk about desktop mode, because I think that's what we care about.

825
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:25,680
So like I mentioned, Plasma 5.23.5, last updated January 4th of 2022.

826
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:30,600
Linux 5.13 with Valve 21-1 patch set.

827
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,600
X11 desktop.

828
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,600
Not Wayland.

829
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,600
Did we know that?

830
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,640
I think so.

831
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,360
But just confirming, it is X11 when you switch to Plasma.

832
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:42,200
In fact, the way you switch to desktop mode is you hold down the power button for a few

833
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,200
seconds.

834
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,320
If you tap the power button, it goes to sleep right away.

835
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:50,160
If you hold down the power button, you get a menu, you know, typical stuff.

836
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,360
And one of them is switch to desktop mode.

837
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,640
There's really no other place in the UI to do that.

838
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,640
So you got to know to hit that power button.

839
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:05,080
When you choose desktop mode, it's the sensation of switching into like another X environment.

840
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:10,440
You get like a whole moment where it's like loading up a Windows session.

841
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:15,040
So it's I think when they're in their big game mode or whatever, it's in its own X environment.

842
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,760
So it does take a few seconds to activate the desktop and it takes a few seconds for

843
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,280
some of the hardware to come available.

844
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,720
I've had to wait up to a minute before the mouse becomes available, the trackpads.

845
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:29,840
And as Plasma is loading, you see like audio device notifications like this audio device

846
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:30,840
is just connected.

847
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,920
So it's interesting how it's doing that.

848
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,720
But once you're there, it's a Plasma desktop.

849
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,600
It's a minimal Plasma desktop.

850
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,640
You can install anything that's a flat pack.

851
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,720
And that's pretty nice.

852
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,480
Where it goes south.

853
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,000
And I hate to say this because I'm sure the developer team actually worked pretty hard

854
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
on it.

855
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,360
Oh, my God, the virtual keyboard is so bad under Plasma.

856
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:57,200
It's so bad.

857
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:03,120
So they clearly want you to use your thumbs on both trackpads of the right and left trackpad.

858
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:08,280
And then they want you to like aim in on the keys and then like tap, tap, tap, tap on them

859
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,560
and they want you to use your right thumb for the right side of the keyboard.

860
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,720
They want you to use your left thumb for the left side of the keyboard.

861
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,480
And you're kind of supposed to sit there and whiz through the keyboard with you with the

862
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,880
thumb pads.

863
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,280
But because the thumb pads are only really just maybe slightly larger than the size of

864
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,840
my thumb.

865
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:29,160
I have to constantly raise my thumb to reset and get more trackpad.

866
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:33,000
When you raise your thumb, it resets the focus point.

867
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Oh, no.

868
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Back to the bottom of the keyboard.

869
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Oh, man.

870
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,520
So you lose your distance like a funny one is like, say, you know, you're saying yes

871
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,240
to a command prompt.

872
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,760
So you go to use the right thumb pad.

873
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,200
But before I can get to the Y, I run out of trackpad.

874
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:50,000
So then I lift my thumb to get a little more trackpad and then it resets the focus point

875
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,920
all the way to the bottom of the keyboard again.

876
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,280
And I sit there and I keep trying to get to Y, but I never have enough distance.

877
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,280
Oh, no.

878
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,440
So then like an animal, I go to peck at him because you can touch it, but you really got

879
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,960
to push it like it's like almost like it's a capacitive screen.

880
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:08,840
Remember those old touch screens before smartphones industrial style, but it's not a capacitive

881
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:09,840
screen.

882
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:14,280
I don't know why you got to press that hard and it still sometimes doesn't register.

883
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,200
It's awful.

884
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:21,960
And the combo of the various different input limitations using touchpad or touch screen

885
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:27,400
or whatever you're doing, the combination of their various limitations makes inputting

886
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,920
complicated passwords unbelievably frustrating.

887
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:37,040
Like wow, unbelievably frustrating, so painful, so painful that you'll either just give up

888
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:41,320
on the desktop mode altogether or you'll like pair a Bluetooth keyboard or hook up a USB

889
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:45,000
keyboard and just use a physical keyboard because it's excruciating.

890
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,320
And I don't really understand why it's so bad.

891
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:54,040
And then to make things worse, if you don't have steam running, it doesn't seem like the

892
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,900
virtual keyboard works at all.

893
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:59,200
And if steam can't connect to the internet because maybe you're not on Wi-Fi, keyboard

894
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,440
doesn't work at all.

895
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:04,240
So I had no keyboard if I didn't have internet because I couldn't be signed into steam.

896
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:07,740
So therefore the keyboard wouldn't launch because it seems like the keyboard's a steam

897
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:08,740
app or something like that.

898
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:09,740
I don't know.

899
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:11,520
I don't know.

900
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,180
But it was, that was very beta.

901
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:14,180
You know what I mean?

902
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:15,900
Like I suppose that makes sense.

903
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:19,720
You know, if you want, if you're going to have polish in one area, you want it in, in

904
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:24,620
the gaming experience, I guess, but it's interesting as a Linux enthusiast sort of in the field

905
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:29,680
report that I guess, yeah, this is where the rough edges are at the moment.

906
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,680
Yeah.

907
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:33,760
And I don't really know, maybe they could have just shipped any free software virtual

908
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,760
keyboard.

909
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:38,040
It may have been a lot better because the other thing it totally screws up is it's trying

910
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:43,160
to figure out where the content is in a terminal, but it doesn't know where it's going to be.

911
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:46,780
So say you want to try out Pac-Man because you want to see what it's like to do a Pac-Man

912
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:47,780
update.

913
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:50,640
And so you're doing your Pac-Man, S-Y-U.

914
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:56,520
Well first of all, it took you about six minutes to type out Pac-Man dash capital S lowercase

915
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:00,560
Y U and then you hit enter.

916
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:04,000
But now you can't see it because the output is now under the keyboard.

917
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,360
So you clear the keyboard, keyboard comes back.

918
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:11,760
Next time you need to like say yes to the prompt and it wants to help you out.

919
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,960
So the keyboard now pops up at the top screen because now the content of the terminals at

920
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:15,960
the bottom of the screen.

921
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,800
So then when I hit yes, of course the terminal then scrolls up with new information like

922
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,880
the packages that are going to be updated, which is now covered by the keyboard.

923
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:28,400
So then I have to turn the keyboard off and after we invoke the keyboard, but this time,

924
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,520
this time, because the prompts at the bottom of the terminal, it's still not quite guessing

925
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,520
it right.

926
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,180
So it covers up the content I need to read.

927
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:38,440
So I got to then turn the keyboard off, read the content, remember what I got to say yes

928
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:41,320
to then turn it back on and try to guess the right prompts of yes.

929
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,480
So what I usually would do is like, okay, I think it's asking for my pseudo passwords.

930
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,880
I'll type that in now.

931
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,680
And now it's asking if I want to update these packages.

932
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:51,400
So I'll just hit yes now and then I'll clear the keyboard and see if I guessed it all right.

933
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:56,280
And that's the actual process of using the virtual keyboard on the Steam Deck.

934
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,520
And by the way, when you try to update with Pac-Man, it just yells at you that everything's

935
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,640
read only and you can't all that for nothing.

936
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:07,360
You thought about just SSHing in at this point, cause that might be easier.

937
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:10,880
I actually was trying to get Pac-Man working because I was going to install SSH for you

938
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,040
so you could play around and I was going to invite, right.

939
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:17,280
I was thinking about you, but the thing is, is I couldn't get that far.

940
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:21,360
If you want to install flat pack app, no problem at all, but you want to use Pac-Man, you're

941
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:22,440
getting read only errors.

942
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:27,000
It's not, I wasn't sure if maybe they'd have like a user area you could write to or something

943
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:33,080
like that, but although I wonder about Nix in my home directory, right?

944
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,320
Running the Nix package manager out of my home directory might work.

945
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,880
I knew that was going to come up at some point.

946
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:38,880
It had to.

947
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:39,880
I got to try that.

948
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:46,120
I do have to try that, but as far as actual desktop performance as a desktop machine,

949
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,120
it's fine.

950
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,120
It's like a laptop.

951
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,040
You'll hear it kick up, but the fans are pretty pleasant.

952
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:53,360
It does get pretty warm to the touch, but it's not impossible to hold.

953
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,360
It's still fine.

954
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:57,140
And on the edges where you grip, you don't really have heat.

955
00:50:57,140 --> 00:51:01,320
It's really in the center where all of the parts are and it does have a fan right here

956
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,320
on the back.

957
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,880
So if I turn it towards me, I get a little bit of, you know, I get a little bit of a

958
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:12,020
hairdryer effect going from it, but you could absolutely, because I've done bits and pieces

959
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:17,840
of this, hook it up to a USB-C dock and have an external monitor, external keyboard, external

960
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,360
mouse, peripherals.

961
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:24,560
You could have an audio interface, everything, because I've used my launch keyboard right

962
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:30,000
here as a bit of a USB hub because it has USB-A and C ports and it's USB-C cable.

963
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,720
I hook it into the deck.

964
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,640
I can keep connecting devices.

965
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,640
Everything works.

966
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,360
And in the show notes, I will link to a known good USB-C hub.

967
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,160
I have one on order myself.

968
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:45,120
It has ethernet, it has DisplayPort or HDMI, I can't remember, but it has everything you

969
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:50,200
need because the deck only has one USB-C port, but you could plug all that in and you've

970
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,560
essentially created yourself a docking station.

971
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:56,040
And this thing is a full-fledged PC with a second monitor.

972
00:51:56,040 --> 00:52:01,840
You can actually use the Steam Deck's internal screen as your second display, so you could

973
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:07,440
have an external monitor as your primary display, and then the deck is your secondary monitor.

974
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:11,120
Then you disconnect that USB-C dock and it's just all on the deck.

975
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,760
And that is pretty compelling.

976
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:20,240
The downside is it's a read-only file system, which is tricky to work with, and if you reboot

977
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:29,080
when you're in the desktop mode, it reboots back into the game mode, not the desktop.

978
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,600
Makes sense, right?

979
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,600
You can see why they do that.

980
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,000
For average users, you're going to want to get back.

981
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,120
You think, okay, if I reboot, I'll get back to the gaming mode.

982
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,280
That's exactly what they'd want to have happen.

983
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:42,360
But if you're using it as a desktop and you're in the desktop mode and you reboot, it goes

984
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,680
back into a gaming device.

985
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,200
It might not be what you want.

986
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:50,280
So you negligently decide that you're going to try to do a live stream from the deck.

987
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,620
You're like, real quick, I'm going to reboot, get ready, and then you have to set everything

988
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:54,620
up again.

989
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:56,360
I mean, that seems like a pretty fair limitation.

990
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,200
The battery life could be better as well.

991
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,200
I mean, as a desktop, it's fine.

992
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,240
But when you're using it to play video games, I mean, what do you expect, right?

993
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,880
It gets about three to four hours.

994
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:05,880
It's going to get warm.

995
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:06,880
I don't know, man.

996
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,840
I mean, that's just kind of what the technology's at right now.

997
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:13,440
They could put a better, bigger battery in here, but it's going to cost more.

998
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,440
It's going to be thicker.

999
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:15,440
It's going to be heavier.

1000
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,520
After three hours, you might want to go outside.

1001
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,520
Who knows?

1002
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,520
Maybe.

1003
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,520
Maybe.

1004
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:25,880
But the overall user experience for just gaming, taking out the desktop stuff, is perfect.

1005
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:26,880
They nailed it.

1006
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,640
They nailed it more than I thought they would.

1007
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,040
And I'm really happy I have it now.

1008
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:35,920
It's going to be, I think I am going to see a significant uptick in my home PC gaming.

1009
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:41,900
Because in my unique tiny living situation, I didn't have room for a gaming PC.

1010
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:46,120
So I was kind of gravitating towards things like the Nintendo Switch already.

1011
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,960
Because I have it hooked from a TV.

1012
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:50,520
We could do a little family game play.

1013
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:53,200
This is personal, like portability.

1014
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,200
But it's for PC games.

1015
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:57,320
And I have to keep reminding myself, it's not an ARM device, guys.

1016
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,320
No.

1017
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,320
It's not an ARM device.

1018
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,920
I like, I sit here, and I'm like, I was looking at the kernel, I'm like, but that's not an

1019
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:03,920
ARM.

1020
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:04,920
Oh, right.

1021
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:05,920
Yeah.

1022
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,720
So I'm excited in that sense, like, oh, right, I'm going to play some games.

1023
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:15,160
The other thing that's kind of nice is because the screen is 720, you install some of these

1024
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:20,640
older games I have, like, I have some of the Batman games and some of the Alien games.

1025
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,000
Some of them were made years ago, right?

1026
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,760
But you could put them on Mac settings now, and they just play fantastic on this thing.

1027
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:31,760
I'm curious, Chris, you probably went into this with a particular vision of, yeah, OK,

1028
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,200
it's going to play games great, and it does.

1029
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:40,000
But a particular vision of, like, the Linux desktop part of it, and maybe a use case that

1030
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,440
you had in mind, is that vision now a little different now that you've had these experiences?

1031
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,120
And where do you think that's going?

1032
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,120
Yeah.

1033
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:51,360
I thought it'd be a great, I mean, surprise, I was picturing this as a perfect portable

1034
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,880
podcasting machine, right?

1035
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:59,280
USB-C dock, it has my audio interface, and then you just run Audacity on the screen.

1036
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:03,300
And you know, maybe, like, when we're in a hotel room or something, this is all I need

1037
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,240
to record a podcast.

1038
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:08,980
And I definitely could do that, but it's big, guys.

1039
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:09,980
It's big.

1040
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:12,200
Like, it's a big device.

1041
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,360
It's huge.

1042
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:19,440
And it's, like, at this size, I would just rather have the Dev 1.

1043
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,840
I'd just rather have a laptop.

1044
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:24,120
That was going to be my next question, because you were kind of like, you know, a few weeks

1045
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,040
ago, you were waffling a bit.

1046
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,220
You didn't know this was about to show up.

1047
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:31,600
You were a little less enchanted with the idea after the Dev 1 came out.

1048
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:35,400
This is where I think the Shield does a couple of things better.

1049
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:39,440
The Shield is more portable because of its fold-up clamshell design.

1050
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,800
The portability of this is, frankly, a lot nicer.

1051
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,480
It is easier to move this around.

1052
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:48,280
I actually kind of think this is a superior design built around a game controller.

1053
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:51,680
Kind of the size of that original Xbox Chunky controller.

1054
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,560
Yeah, just a little bit bigger.

1055
00:55:54,560 --> 00:56:01,800
The other thing this does, I'm sad to say, a little bit better than the Steam Deck is

1056
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,600
battery life.

1057
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:10,880
And I am kind of appalled to say that, because this is nearly a 10-year-old device.

1058
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:18,480
And it sat in a box, dead, for like five years, six years, I don't know, a long time.

1059
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:19,980
And it just got charged up.

1060
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:23,200
And now here I am, and the battery life lasts longer.

1061
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,120
Now the games are not as nice.

1062
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:31,840
The capabilities of Android, especially this genre of 2016 Android, are really limiting.

1063
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,640
Like Google Play services crashes constantly.

1064
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,280
The Play Store is always asking me to re-authenticate.

1065
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,600
Android was such a hot mess back then.

1066
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:46,120
And ultimately, it really, really stands out when you have an Android gaming device and

1067
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,800
a pure Linux play.

1068
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,880
The pure Linux play is so much better.

1069
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:50,880
It's so much simpler.

1070
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,600
I don't have to deal with crappy Google services.

1071
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,960
I don't have weird services that are just airing out in the background, and then I'm

1072
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,880
getting error messages and stuff.

1073
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,080
The whole setup process is so smooth.

1074
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:05,480
When you launch a Proton game on this thing, they've got custom splash screens for that

1075
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:10,320
game that tell you, I'm installing the.NET redistributables, and I'm taking care of this

1076
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:14,420
in this really nice way, where it's also, at the same time, showing you all the controls.

1077
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:16,880
By the way, the controls, they're always just a button away.

1078
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:20,080
On any game, you can hit a button, and there's a little slide over that tells you what all

1079
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,320
the controls are for that game at any point.

1080
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:23,320
Oh, nice.

1081
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,320
Yeah.

1082
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,320
There's all that kind of stuff.

1083
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:29,480
You can hold down the Steam button and the X button, or B, or I don't know, one of the

1084
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,480
buttons.

1085
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,680
You can force terminate games.

1086
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:32,680
You can just tap the Steam button.

1087
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:33,680
You get a nice overlay.

1088
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:39,280
The experience on this is so much better than the experience on the Shield ever was, so

1089
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:43,760
much better than any of these Android devices that it makes these things look like silly

1090
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:44,760
toys.

1091
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:48,520
And this is like the premium polished product, the Steam Deck.

1092
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:51,520
So in that regard, it kicks the Shield's butt.

1093
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:56,520
But in terms of total portability, like I can put in my bag and like would be an awesome

1094
00:57:56,520 --> 00:58:01,000
like podcast machine, I mean, it's like night and day difference in size between these two

1095
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,080
things.

1096
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:06,560
And it's kind of crazy that the Shield seems to be getting like two or three more hours

1097
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:07,560
of battery life.

1098
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:11,600
I mean, it's an old ARM device, but I mean, those differences stand out to me.

1099
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:14,400
But otherwise, I think the Deck's a fantastic piece of hardware.

1100
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,400
They nailed it.

1101
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:20,800
And version two, if they get there, is really going to be something to see.

1102
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,040
This is version one.

1103
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:27,080
And I think they pretty much they hit every mark they were trying to hit with version

1104
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,080
one.

1105
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:33,520
You've been looking at reviews of this thing for months now, so you probably weren't surprised

1106
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:34,560
by a lot of things.

1107
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:39,400
But was there anything that you were surprised by actually having it in your hands then?

1108
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:42,280
I think a lot of things that I wasn't sure about, I'm still a little unsure about, is

1109
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:44,320
the trackpads for moving around.

1110
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,080
I think I get it.

1111
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:51,380
It definitely worked in Age of Empires, seemed a little bit iffy on the desktop, so I wasn't

1112
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:52,380
sure how that was.

1113
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:53,380
I'm still not quite sure.

1114
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:55,780
I feel like it's just going to take time.

1115
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:59,880
But no, I mean, in particular, I got lucky because at a meetup, I got a chance to play

1116
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,320
with one and see one.

1117
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:03,960
The desktop mode has been my favorite part of it.

1118
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,000
I've really enjoyed that.

1119
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,720
I like just abused the hell out of my Starlink over the weekend and just like installed terabytes

1120
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:11,720
of games.

1121
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:13,080
I really did.

1122
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:15,640
Sorry, Elon, that was me.

1123
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:16,640
And that was fine, right?

1124
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:20,200
And I just went about using the system and what's kind of neat, and I didn't know this

1125
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,200
before I got it.

1126
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,040
So you're in that big game mode, right?

1127
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,600
And then you drop to desktop, Steam's still running in the background, so you can still

1128
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:27,680
keep downloads going.

1129
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,680
It's just the desktop Steam app now.

1130
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,720
And it just transforms to the desktop app and there's your downloads and I can see where

1131
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:36,680
the queue's at and I can still use the chat app if I was mid chat with somebody.

1132
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:37,680
That is very slick.

1133
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:38,680
Very, very slick.

1134
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:39,680
Yeah, it's great.

1135
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:45,680
And then you go back to game mode, boom, you're all in the other interface.

1136
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,640

1139
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,840
Everyone should have a password manager.

1140
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:57,840
Everyone.

1141
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:02,640
I really think that's probably job number one when you're signing up for services and

1142
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:03,640
websites online.

1143
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:06,360
And I think Bitwarden's the one to go with.

1144
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:08,220
It's easy to get started.

1145
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:09,220
It's open source.

1146
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:11,760
It's trusted by millions of individuals in their communities.

1147
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,860
You have team support, organization support.

1148
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:17,720
It's what we use to manage our passwords here on the show.

1149
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:21,960
It has nice features like account switching, auto username generation along with password

1150
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:22,960
generation.

1151
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:28,400
And one of my favorite features, it can help keep track of my two factor login.

1152
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:32,440
Bitwarden also gives me the confidence to use strong passwords with all of the applications

1153
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:34,160
I self host.

1154
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,400
All of our web front ends that we log into.

1155
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:41,400
I mean, I probably have 15, 30 different apps that we self host now.

1156
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:44,900
And if it wasn't for Bitwarden, I wouldn't feel comfortable as a team using really secure

1157
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:45,900
complex passwords.

1158
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,960
And you just have to do it these days.

1159
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:51,060
And Bitwarden is always adding features to make it better and better.

1160
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:54,240
And the experience on mobile is absolutely the best.

1161
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:58,320
I have the most experience with iOS, some on Android, but the most with iOS.

1162
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:03,940
And the integration with the password filling on iOS and Face ID makes getting your passwords

1163
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:05,920
on mobile so simple.

1164
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,280
And on Android, they're just as smooth.

1165
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:13,080
It's really an impressive set of dev teams they have for both the iOS and their Android

1166
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:14,080
side.

1167
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:17,000
And of course, they have a Linux desktop app as well.

1168
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,120
Really easy to get started too.

1169
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:21,960
You can just go to bitwarden.com slash Linux and try it out for yourself and get a free

1170
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:22,960
account.

1171
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,860
And they're always adding new features.

1172
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:26,600
Their job is security and privacy.

1173
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,260
It's what they're focused on.

1174
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:30,320
It gives you a little bit of peace of mind.

1175
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:34,280
And maybe you have a password manager already, but maybe someone you know, a friend or family

1176
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:39,600
or maybe your workplace isn't using the best password practices and isn't using the best

1177
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:40,600
password manager.

1178
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,680
Send them to Bitwarden.

1179
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:43,840
You'll know they'll be taken care of.

1180
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:44,840
You know they'll be safe.

1181
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,800
You know they're going to be way better off.

1182
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,000
Just tell them it's easy.

1183
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

1184
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,400
And if you haven't done it yourself, try it out for yourself too.

1185
01:01:54,400 --> 01:02:00,440
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

1186
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:03,200
Our first boost today comes from Marcel.

1187
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:09,480
Six days ago, one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven sets.

1188
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:13,440
For those who like Vim and Reples, I can't recommend Vim.

1189
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,680
I Python sell highly enough.

1190
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:19,480
It works for more than just Python.

1191
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:23,120
And by the way, does West Coast Canada count as West Coast?

1192
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:24,960
When is the Canada meetup?

1193
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,680
Fran, did you get him to boost this in?

1194
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:28,680
That's a really great question.

1195
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:31,720
I've been thinking about this for a few years, actually.

1196
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,280
You can't just have a Canada meetup.

1197
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,280
Have you seen a map?

1198
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:38,880
This is a relatively large piece of land over here.

1199
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:39,880
You're all spread out up there.

1200
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:47,080
I think West Coast does include Western Canada, but I don't think it does on this particular

1201
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:52,200
West Coast trip, mostly because we're leaving from the studio and headed south.

1202
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:55,840
But I don't see why we can't have a Vancouver meetup or something in the near future.

1203
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:57,760
Yeah, I would love that.

1204
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:01,560
The only problem is we'll probably have to take the anti-vaxx wrap off of JOOPS.

1205
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,400
I don't think they'll let us across the border with that.

1206
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:07,400
Right, and that flag is a little obnoxious, too.

1207
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:10,440
And you're going to have to learn VIM because this, honestly, thanks Marcel, this looks

1208
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:11,440
like a great pick.

1209
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:14,320
I've never played with it before, but we'll have it linked in the show notes because I

1210
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:15,800
definitely will be.

1211
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,440
Okay, one more boost from me right now.

1212
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:24,600
Ricky Kressling, six days ago, 1,111 Satoshis.

1213
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:25,600
Boost.

1214
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:30,480
Hey guys, I'm a long time listener, but first time booster.

1215
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:34,600
Would love it if you guys could check out my relatively new app, Furtherance, for a

1216
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:38,800
potential pick while you're sneaking in with the boost, so I like it.

1217
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:43,560
The time tracking app that stores all data locally, no potential for snooping.

1218
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:49,960
And of course, it's written in Rust.

1219
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:54,640
And available on Flathub to keep things easy.

1220
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:57,480
Thanks for everything you do, Ricky.

1221
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:04,080
And written with GTK4, so this is really taking like the most modern GNOME desktop technologies

1222
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:09,520
and bringing them together, and it looks like a freaking fantastic app.

1223
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:13,560
Beautiful UI, tasks are saved in that local database with unlimited capacity, they're

1224
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:18,760
grouped by name and date, tasks can be edited after they're created, settings to customize

1225
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:22,160
the view and defaults to your liking, and more features are coming.

1226
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:24,720
And he says, just open an issue if you'd like to see something.

1227
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:27,480
So we'll put a link to the Flathub into the GitHub.

1228
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:28,480
That looks really great.

1229
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:31,360
Yeah, sorry for butchering your name there, Ricky.

1230
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:34,760
This looks like a fantastic pick, and you know, when we need to keep track of how long

1231
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:40,560
Brent takes to install things in the future, I think this is what we'll be using.

1232
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:43,080
We got a wonderful boost from Tim Apple.

1233
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:47,280
I wonder if that's the Tim from Apple, but who knows?

1234
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:48,280
Oh, it must be, right?

1235
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:49,600
Sure, I would assume.

1236
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:56,160
Five days ago with 2,222 SATs.

1237
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,720
And Tim simply says, happy Linuxing.

1238
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,880
Well, happy Linuxing to you, Tim Apple.

1239
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:02,880
Thank you.

1240
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:03,880
One of my favorite usernames.

1241
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:09,040
The Golden Dragon also wrote in five days ago with 2,222 SATs.

1242
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:11,120
Yeah, road ducks.

1243
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:14,480
Thank you very much, and here's something for your trouble.

1244
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:18,160
Wichita Kays check in for meetup, thanks for the show.

1245
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:22,960
You know, Wichita Kays is 2,000 miles from the studio, Brent.

1246
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:26,840
I don't know if we're going to be doing a meetup over there anytime too soon, Golden

1247
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:27,840
Dragon.

1248
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:33,760
Yeah, someone asked me recently if we were going to head to Toronto, which is 3,000 kilometers

1249
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:34,760
away.

1250
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:38,440
So maybe someday we will, but not just this time.

1251
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:43,240
I don't know why we give our resident Canadian the boost with the tricky state names also.

1252
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:46,320
So I think that's Kansas for Brent's wisdom.

1253
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:47,680
Oh, right, right.

1254
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:48,680
Thank you.

1255
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:49,680
Wichita!

1256
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:50,680
Wichita!

1257
01:05:50,680 --> 01:06:07,600
The Golden Dragon sent in a double boost with, as you may have predicted, 2,222 SATs.

1258
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,480
Double boost for missing last episode's boost.

1259
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:11,880
Wes, do you have any learning tips for learning Pythons?

1260
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:13,960
I mean, I don't know if I have any specific tips.

1261
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:16,280
It kind of depends on what you want to do, right?

1262
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:18,080
You and I have talked about this in detail.

1263
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:20,840
Yeah, it's a big topic.

1264
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:24,760
Maybe just go listen to Coder Radio because there's been some good conversation about

1265
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:29,680
Mike's adventures down the road of Python in the past year or so as well.

1266
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:33,280
But come up with something that means something to you, whether that's scraping stuff from

1267
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:37,600
a website, automating something, just playing around in a terminal.

1268
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:38,600
There's a lot of ways to get started.

1269
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:42,160
I think last episode we touched on Jupyter Notebooks can be a nice way to make things

1270
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,780
a little more concrete.

1271
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:48,840
You can use the pick we just mentioned earlier today if you want to try that from Vim, if

1272
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:49,840
you're already a Vim user.

1273
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:53,620
Yeah, you got to make it mean something to you so you're incentivized to get over the

1274
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:58,180
hurdles when things inevitably break or don't go your way the first time.

1275
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:10,080
Optimus Gray also boosted in four days ago with 22,222 SATs.

1276
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,800
That seems like a grandpa duck, right?

1277
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:12,800
That's a big duck.

1278
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:13,800
That's what that is.

1279
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:14,800
I'm a duck.

1280
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:15,800
D-U-K duck.

1281
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,160
Loaded with talent.

1282
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:18,160
Thank you, Optimus.

1283
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:23,560
Optimus writes, Brent, please enjoy playing with Alex's chair when he's out of town.

1284
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:28,520
Now, I happen to know that before Alex left, he made sure there's a sign directly in front

1285
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:31,560
of Brent's face that says, do not touch the chair.

1286
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:33,120
It's there, isn't it?

1287
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:38,280
Actually, it clearly says, no touchy the chair.

1288
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:39,280
Have you touched the chair?

1289
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,800
I mean, rules are there to be broken, right?

1290
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,720
Yeah, or at least to be bent, right?

1291
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:44,720
I agree.

1292
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:45,720
Good.

1293
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:47,840
I mean, I want you comfortable.

1294
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:48,840
Thank you.

1295
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:49,840
Thank you.

1296
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:54,760
I think Alex might forgive me for keeping it to my own economics for a month.

1297
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,800
You know, don't want to strain my back.

1298
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:57,800
That's right.

1299
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:58,800
Yeah.

1300
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:06,120
Eric, the one boosted in five days ago with 50 SATs, B-O-O-S-T.

1301
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:10,840
It wants to know if we've tried the Nebula relay system that was released in 1.6.0.

1302
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:15,920
We haven't tried it, but we did mention it because it was a highly requested feature

1303
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:19,160
and Nebula is a fantastic project.

1304
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:25,400
It is a great solution for building your own custom mesh VPN network.

1305
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:30,440
Could be fantastic if you have VPSs across multiple providers or something like that.

1306
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,840
So yeah, I definitely am a big fan.

1307
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:37,500
I haven't needed it yet because I don't have any ridiculous double net scenarios like a

1308
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:38,680
certain Mr. Fisher.

1309
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:41,800
So in my Nebula usage was fine before, but you're right.

1310
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,140
It's a very nice feature to have.

1311
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:49,400
And for me, the type of devices I use, my mobile devices and different architectures,

1312
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:51,680
set up time with tailscales like so quick.

1313
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:56,060
It was just the right way for me to go, especially on my iOS devices and on my Android devices.

1314
01:08:56,060 --> 01:09:00,440
But I could totally see a scenario where Nebula would be the right choice.

1315
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:08,040
Neural P boosted in four days ago with a hot boost, 8,192 SATs.

1316
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:10,960
He says, Manjaro with plasma.

1317
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,920
That's the only way to fly.

1318
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:14,720
Thanks for the many years of Linux coverage.

1319
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:17,480
Did that cross your mind at all, Brent, Manjaro?

1320
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:19,380
I'm embarrassed to say that it didn't.

1321
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:23,440
And I'll put a little bit of that blame on you as well because we should have thought

1322
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:24,560
of this.

1323
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,080
Maybe that's the next foray.

1324
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:29,120
I feel like I haven't touched Manjaro in too long.

1325
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,960
So maybe time to give it a spin again.

1326
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:31,960
Yeah, I'll take it.

1327
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:35,520
I'll take it because I wanted to get your spin on Neon for this episode.

1328
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,520
I wanted to hear what you thought about it, but you're right.

1329
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:40,580
I think you just want to see if it's actually well suited for the studio.

1330
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:41,960
Give it some some paces.

1331
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:42,960
Let Brent fail.

1332
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:46,860
I think we got to get Brent trying out that new Arch installer, you know, if anyone's

1333
01:09:46,860 --> 01:09:48,360
going to break it, it's Brent.

1334
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:50,560
Better get him on the next installer, too, right?

1335
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,920
I mean, might as well spread it around.

1336
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:55,960
GeneBean boosted in four days ago with a thousand SATs.

1337
01:09:55,960 --> 01:10:00,480
I'm a Georgia boy, but I'll be in Portland July 24th through August 2nd, just in case

1338
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,360
that lines up with your meetup plans.

1339
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:06,960
It doesn't, GeneBean, but you is welcome up to the studio if you wanted to make the four

1340
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,120
and a half, five hour trek.

1341
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:09,120
A nice drive.

1342
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,120
It is a nice drive.

1343
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:14,440
You'd be welcome to join us on a Sunday up here at the studio and crack open the grill.

1344
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:19,520
And then Gene double boosted in four days ago with five thousand SATs.

1345
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:20,520
Heck yeah.

1346
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:25,760
He says, so, guys, do you not have monitorings on your disk spaces and your CPUs and your

1347
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:26,760
memories?

1348
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:29,620
How come you didn't catch the matrix server disk being full?

1349
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:31,160
If not, hit me up.

1350
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:32,720
I'll help you build one.

1351
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:34,720
It doesn't have to be hard.

1352
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:41,520
It's not because it's hard and to be clear, we do.

1353
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:46,200
We do have monitoring on there to to a pretty large degree.

1354
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:50,720
And also Linode comes with default monitoring that also is just there by default.

1355
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:54,100
The problem is when you're at ninety five percent and you don't think you have anything

1356
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:57,640
more available, it doesn't monitor it doesn't really get you anything right.

1357
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:59,720
Like we knew this was going to happen.

1358
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:02,840
It was more of a when was it going to happen?

1359
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:09,400
Also, I mean, there is the reality that my inbox is heavily filtered, like, like a lot

1360
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:13,160
of the automated stuff doesn't even make it to the first page of my inbox.

1361
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:16,480
So I kind of take that responsibility on to that sort of my bad.

1362
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:17,940
But we do have some monitoring on there.

1363
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:18,940
Could we have more?

1364
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:19,940
I don't know.

1365
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:21,840
Actually, I mean, I mean, maybe.

1366
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:25,160
But would I see the alerts if I had a dashboard?

1367
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:26,240
Maybe I would.

1368
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:31,720
And then Gene Bean comes in with the rare triple boost with a set of SATs, thirteen

1369
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:32,720
thirty seven.

1370
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:37,840
Side note, I love being able to stream SATs and do boost so much that I am dealing with

1371
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:43,400
podcast apps that are notably subpar on iOS when compared to overcast.

1372
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:47,880
I know exactly what you mean, Gene Bean, although the trend has been my friend fountain has

1373
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:51,960
been getting better and all the other apps have been getting better.

1374
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:54,020
They've added new features as time has gone on.

1375
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:56,180
But there are things I miss from overcast.

1376
01:11:56,180 --> 01:12:01,840
The number one for me is the whole overcast voice boost system and smart speed system.

1377
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:05,400
Obviously, Marco knew what he was doing there, but I love boosting.

1378
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:08,920
So I, like you, have switched to a different app.

1379
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:14,740
Oh, here we've got a theme gas money boosts.

1380
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:15,740
First one's from P.L.

1381
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:22,640
Trent three days ago, 5000 SATs, just some gas money for Brent and another from Michael

1382
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:28,640
B. Yesterday, 30 K SATs for Brent's travel pocket.

1383
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:30,640
Happy project time for you.

1384
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:31,640
What?

1385
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:32,640
Oh.

1386
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:35,640
Yeah, that's great.

1387
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:43,120
That'll be great, Brent.

1388
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:44,120
That'll be great.

1389
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:45,120
Impressive.

1390
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:49,760
I need to come down to the studio, hopefully before the trip, a to get that dear laptop

1391
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,720
that's sitting there waiting for me.

1392
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:53,440
And B to see your friendly faces.

1393
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:55,800
Oh, we're going to have projects to do before the trip.

1394
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:58,480
So, yeah, you're going to have to get here because we're going to have to you know, that'll

1395
01:12:58,480 --> 01:12:59,480
be great.

1396
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:00,480
Thank you, Michael.

1397
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:01,720
Yeah, thank you very much.

1398
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:07,920
CB wrote in with a nice amount of elite sets as well.

1399
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:11,560
I'd like to contribute in some way to the show or even participate, but I just can't

1400
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:13,960
make this Sunday time slot.

1401
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:14,960
That's OK.

1402
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:17,680
We record this thing so you don't have to be here.

1403
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:19,720
Plus with ADHD.

1404
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:20,720
It's bad.

1405
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:23,840
I've had 80 of them ADHD.

1406
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:27,560
I can never remember to write in about a specific topic that was discussed.

1407
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:31,480
So I figured I'd boost in a Linux joke every once in a while.

1408
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:32,480
All right.

1409
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:33,480
Let's let's see.

1410
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:34,480
You ready?

1411
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:35,480
I'm ready.

1412
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:36,480
Yeah.

1413
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:39,800
What's the only way to generate a truly random string?

1414
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:40,800
Hmm.

1415
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:44,760
Well, I mean, the technical answer is to ask us to pronounce something.

1416
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:45,760
Yeah.

1417
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:46,760
Oh, that's good.

1418
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:47,760
Let's go.

1419
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:48,760
That is pretty good.

1420
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:49,760
Is it a crisp pronunciation jab?

1421
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:50,760
Yeah.

1422
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:54,040
Put a Windows user in front of Vim and tell them to quit.

1423
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:58,960
Oh, OK, fair.

1424
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:02,240
By the way, Linux Unplugged is my favorite LTS.

1425
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:03,480
Love the show.

1426
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:06,380
Well, thank you very much, CB.

1427
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:07,380
That's great.

1428
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:08,380
You know what?

1429
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:09,440
I'll take a Linux joke from time to time.

1430
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:10,760
That's actually a lot of fun.

1431
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:17,200
We got a nice batch of thank you boosts too.

1432
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:22,600
We got five hundred sats from Bronswig, who is coming in with a Boise check in user sixty

1433
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:25,680
five nine streamed a hundred sats while listening.

1434
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:30,200
Nineteen thousand sats streamed from user five oh seven twelve hundred sats from L.T.

1435
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:34,880
Guy zero zero five five hundred sats from Eric the one saying go break go.

1436
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:35,880
I love it.

1437
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:37,100
You got some support.

1438
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:44,520
And then the value for value legend, one of a club of legends on value for value.

1439
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:47,560
Three thousand six hundred and ninety sats from Mr.

1440
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:49,320
Cosby Lend.

1441
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:52,680
Thank you, everybody, very much for your support and your notes.

1442
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:55,680
One of the things we're discovering that we love about the boosts is that it brings up

1443
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:58,440
random conversations that we never planned on having.

1444
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:00,760
So we love a good thought provoking boost.

1445
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:03,720
Also I put my node link in the notes again.

1446
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:07,000
We could use some nice large inbound capacity because we're getting lots of boost these

1447
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,480
days so we could use some big capacity channels.

1448
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:13,320
If you don't have a podcasting two to no compatible app, go grab one.

1449
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:18,120
They've got tons of features like the booster grams, chapters, host info, sat streaming,

1450
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:24,240
advanced search, value for value, transcripts, clips, I could go live streaming and it could

1451
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:25,720
go on and on.

1452
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:28,120
Lots of options at new podcast apps dot com.

1453
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:34,000
Or if you just want to go the hard core route, boost CLI or breeze, B-R-E-E-Z dot technology.

1454
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:39,160
If you don't want to switch your app, nice to see antenna pod getting some podcasting

1455
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:40,160
to the features.

1456
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:44,800
They may have breeze integration in the future.

1457
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,680
Now we have a pic that we're using right now to do the show.

1458
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:48,680
So this will be fun.

1459
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:55,520
Yeah, the pic is droid cam, something I'd played with years ago, but had never really

1460
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:59,480
used in anger until this week.

1461
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:02,160
Full disclosure, I caught COVID.

1462
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:04,240
Not going to go bring that up to the studio.

1463
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:10,140
So for the first time in quite a long time, I'm broadcasting from home today.

1464
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:14,920
And well, yeah, okay, I've got an audio setup figured out for LAN and you know, just for

1465
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:16,800
regular old audio things.

1466
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,760
But since we started doing video, you know, at least for Jupiter tube, it's nice.

1467
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:24,960
It's nice to have I didn't want to I didn't want to bring a blank screen to the show.

1468
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:27,320
But I didn't I didn't have any better setup.

1469
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:28,320
What did I have?

1470
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,360
I had my pixel three handy.

1471
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:33,220
And with droid cam, that was basically all I needed.

1472
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:38,120
This is really a great idea, Wes, because probably a lot of us the best camera we have

1473
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:39,520
is our smartphone camera.

1474
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:43,200
So does it show up as a device to the OS?

1475
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:44,200
How does that part work?

1476
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,360
Yeah, so there's a couple of options.

1477
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:47,960
By default, you get it installed.

1478
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:51,600
It's in the Play Store, it's in the App Store, actually, too, it looks like though I have

1479
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:55,160
not tried the iOS version as yet.

1480
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:59,080
And so you get a video stream, so you could just bring it into OBS that way, if you're

1481
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:02,840
doing something like that, I went the USB route.

1482
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:07,880
So you do at least on the Android side, you do need to enable USB debugging.

1483
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:13,340
And then they've got a for the for Linux, they've got a V4L2 loopback driver that lets

1484
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:17,380
you kind of customize things as well as a cute little Linux app that lets you mess with

1485
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:23,040
the white balance, you can sort of flip things vertically or horizontal, or even zoom in

1486
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,940
if you want to, which is pretty gosh darn handy as well.

1487
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:29,400
You can do a dramatic chipmunk zoom with droid cam.

1488
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:33,100
The part that I was a little worried about right away was like, well, what was the latency

1489
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:36,520
going to be like, but it's been it's been surprisingly good.

1490
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:42,340
The other part that's nice is when you use their app, whether you use a direct USB connection,

1491
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:47,780
or you use the wireless connection, it still creates a virtual device for you.

1492
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:50,380
So you don't have to worry about which way you do it, it just shows up, you can import

1493
01:17:50,380 --> 01:17:55,220
into your teams or your Skype or your, you know, whatever WebRTC app of the day that

1494
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:58,280
you happen to be using to connect with whoever you're talking with.

1495
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:04,980
That is such a great pick because a lot of us could use a better webcam and I'm one of

1496
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:09,820
them and like upstairs, I don't have the right lighting situation and like my built-in webcam

1497
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:13,880
on the laptops, they just don't do it justice, but I bet you the phone camera could handle

1498
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:14,880
that just fine.

1499
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:18,200
So we'll put a link to droid cam in the show notes.

1500
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:19,200
That's pretty great.

1501
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:22,220
Now, the only trick I think you really ran into is it does take a bunch of power.

1502
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:27,960
So you better get your phone charged or have like a way to do power delivery and USB data.

1503
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:28,960
That could be tricky.

1504
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:29,960
I guess.

1505
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:30,960
Yeah.

1506
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:33,620
You know, if you're down to at 15 or 20 percent, it might not last a while.

1507
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:37,760
I got over 50 before we started the show and it's only down to 47 percent.

1508
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:40,040
It looks like the client also reports.

1509
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:41,180
So it is charging.

1510
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:43,720
It's using a little more than it's charging, at least in my current setup.

1511
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:46,940
But I mean, at that rate, we could stream for hours.

1512
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:48,500
Yeah, that's pretty great.

1513
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:50,240
We'll keep going.

1514
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:54,340
We do stream live over at Jupiter dot tube every single Sunday.

1515
01:18:54,340 --> 01:18:57,540
I usually get the stream going around noon Pacific time.

1516
01:18:57,540 --> 01:19:00,660
I guess that'd be about three p.m. on the East Coast where Brent's at.

1517
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:01,660
Right.

1518
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:02,660
Get that right there.

1519
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:03,660
Brent.

1520
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:04,660
The clock says yes.

1521
01:19:04,660 --> 01:19:05,660
Hey, that's nice.

1522
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:08,740
It's nice when I get approval from father time.

1523
01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:12,540
But of course, you know, I just grab the show whenever the heck you want by going to Linux

1524
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:14,080
unplugged dot com.

1525
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:18,220
Links to what we talked about today will be at Linux unplugged dot com slash four, six,

1526
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:19,220
seven.

1527
01:19:19,220 --> 01:19:23,300
And if you're ready to listen to something else, don't miss that gosh darn Linux action

1528
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:24,580
news.

1529
01:19:24,580 --> 01:19:26,480
That's a whole additional thing.

1530
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:27,740
It's like a different podcast.

1531
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:30,280
It's a whole other RSS feed.

1532
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:33,260
Way less nonsense, way more facts.

1533
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:34,260
That's very true.

1534
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:37,660
There's a lot going on every week and we try to capture the stuff that matters the most

1535
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:38,660
over there.

1536
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:42,100
So subscribe to Linux action news as well.

1537
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:45,060
But for us, well, we're going to be back here at the same bat time and the same bat

1538
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:46,760
channel next week.

1539
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:47,760
We'll help you join us.

1540
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:51,700
That Mumble room will be open for you at Linux unplugged dot com slash mumble and join our

1541
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:52,700
matrix.

1542
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:54,220
Matrix is growing like crazy.

1543
01:19:54,220 --> 01:19:58,800
Sixty million active matrix users now join the Jupiter Broadcasting Matrix.

1544
01:19:58,800 --> 01:19:59,800
We got a general chat.

1545
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:01,180
We got rooms for Linux unplugged.

1546
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:03,100
There's even a Bitcoin room over there.

1547
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:05,340
Some of the best discussion on the Internet.

1548
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:06,500
So don't miss it.

1549
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:08,300
Our matrix room is popping.

1550
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:10,580
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of unplugged.

1551
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:30,980
We'll see you right back here next Sunday.

1552
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:57,340
Well, Brett, you did the hard work, you did it on a deadline, but now you got yourself

1553
01:20:57,340 --> 01:21:00,260
a podcasting machine for like the next month.

1554
01:21:00,260 --> 01:21:01,940
It's true, but I'm going to see it.

1555
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:04,980
You know, if it works really well, I'm going to see if maybe I could take it home with

1556
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:05,980
me.

1557
01:21:05,980 --> 01:21:06,980
It's a little big, maybe.

1558
01:21:06,980 --> 01:21:07,980
But we'll see.

1559
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:08,980
It's carry on size.

1560
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:10,700
I think ship it, just ship it.

1561
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:17,140
I mean, it might it might break, but what is great is it didn't fail in the middle of

1562
01:21:17,140 --> 01:21:19,940
our recording, despite not us testing it.

1563
01:21:19,940 --> 01:21:24,660
So that's something I mean, we haven't saved what I recorded yet.

1564
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:41,940
So there's still time.
