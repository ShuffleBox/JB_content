1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So you hear all the hype about mechanical keyboards, but they're really expensive, let's be honest.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,860
So that's where the Buckle Spring project comes in.

3
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:18,440
It's nostalgic keyboard sounds that emulate the sound of the old faithful IBM Model M

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,180
keyboard.

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,620
The author of the project has painstakingly captured the sound of each key.

6
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:32,800
This is a real conversation that I typed up to Westpane, and this is what it sounds like.

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,880
And it runs on your machine, in the background, and as you type, it makes these sounds come

8
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,880
out your speakers.

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,300
Finally an answer for that problem where I'm at the coffee shop, but no one knows how nerdy

10
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,840
I am, and now I can bother all of them.

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,360
It's on-demand Model M typing.

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,360
You're welcome.

13
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,480
We'll have a link to that in the show notes.

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:01:02,120
A lot of fun.

15
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,160
Hello friends, welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

16
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,160
My name is Chris.

17
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,160
My name is Lance.

18
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,680
And this episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru, the leader in hands-on learning.

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,600
The only way to learn a new skill is by doing.

20
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,760
That's why ACG provides hands-on labs for Cloud Linux servers and much more.

21
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,640
Get your hands cloudy at a CloudGuru.com.

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,600
Coming up on this week's episode, we're finally doing it.

23
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,400
We have gotten so many requests into the show, and it seemed like now, at the beginning of

24
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:36,280
the year, when there's so much left to happen, it was the time to try out OpenSUSE.

25
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,640
We gave it a go, essentially wrapped up last week's episode, and Wes and I loaded it up.

26
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,920
Been running it on some metal directly, and I think we both opted for the tumbleweed route.

27
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,880
Wes and I have not been telling each other much about our experience to save it for the

28
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,880
show.

29
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,880
Secret, secret.

30
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,880
You went tumbleweed though, right?

31
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,880
I sure did.

32
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,640
Yeah, I mean, our kind of thought here was, we feel like there's a lot in the air for

33
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,640
OpenSUSE.

34
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,360
Like, some stuff's going to happen this year, and there's also a lot of momentum behind

35
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,880
rolling distributions, and Arch is always the go-to example that's cited.

36
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:16,240
But SUSE has been at this for a while now, and is it a viable Arch alternative?

37
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,320
Is it a workstation rolling OS?

38
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,600
So we wanted to give it a go and relay our experiences to you with OpenSUSE at Tumbleweed,

39
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,000
and we'll do that in a little bit.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,200
But of course, we also have some really great community news.

41
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,960
We have a pick that's fantastic, it's going to make you way more productive, and a lot

42
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,960
more.

43
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,160
So to help us get through all of this, we have to turn to our crack team.

44
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,160
Time appropriate greetings, Momorub.

45
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,160
Hello.

46
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,160
Greetings.

47
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,160
Howdy.

48
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,380
Buenos tardes.

49
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,480
Happy New Year, everybody.

50
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,080
Here's a New Year's taco for you.

51
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,780
And thanks for being here.

52
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,060
We have some community news to start with.

53
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:57,040
And I don't know what's going on here, so I just wanted to have an open conversation

54
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:04,080
in the show, because I bet a lot of you have seen the recent news about Steam data.

55
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,280
It appears that Linux market share has slid badly over the holiday period.

56
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,840
And one of the reasons I wanted to talk about this is because the numbers are so dramatic,

57
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,840
it's going to kind of make its rounds.

58
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,040
And I think we can explain what's happening.

59
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,320
Steam published their annual, or no, monthly, whatever it is, their frequent survey that

60
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,360
I never seem to get ever, ever on my Linux box.

61
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,760
Have you ever gotten a Steam hardware survey, Wes?

62
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,760
Actually for the first time ever this year.

63
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,800
I mean, I've gotten it a ton of times on my Windows gaming box that I seldom mention,

64
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,560
but on all the Linux ones, no, never, except this one.

65
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,120
So I was glad, and of course, I immediately filled it out.

66
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,840
Yeah, well, so I think maybe once ever in all of the years, but according to the published

67
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,240
numbers from Valve, this came out on January 1st, so it was like a real kick in the stomach

68
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:56,880
at the beginning of the year, the Linux market share on Steam had a pretty significant drop.

69
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,560
It was just 0.5%.

70
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,920
We were hoping to get to 1% soon.

71
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,400
It was a drop of 0.33%, which is pretty major in these numbers.

72
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,520
And Windows picked up a pretty decent market share, just over 1.6% additional market share.

73
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:18,720
Mac OS didn't do so well either, but the first round of numbers out of Valve looked kind

74
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,640
of devastating just because, you know, over the holiday period, you hope more people are

75
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,640
playing video games.

76
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,840
Yeah, and there's been some updates there, Valve's updated those numbers, but they still

77
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,280
point to Linux regressing, really doesn't look great.

78
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,000
After being at 0.9% for the month of November, Valve's revised December 2020 numbers, put

79
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,680
the Linux gaming market share at 0.74%, or a drop of 0.16%.

80
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,680
Yikes.

81
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,200
Yeah, so not as significant, but still not good, and kind of hard to understand when

82
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,800
Proton is making it possible to play more games than ever.

83
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,400
The library of available Linux games is greater than it's ever been, and the compatibility

84
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,400
is greater than it's ever been.

85
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,280
But I think you have to consider, I could be wrong because who really knows here, but

86
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:10,080
you have to consider Cyberpunk 2077 came out around the time that the survey was conducted.

87
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,680
That is true, yeah.

88
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,640
And I think, although people could confirm in the chat room, but I'm pretty sure that

89
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,000
you're more likely to get the survey on a new install.

90
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,600
So perhaps people were setting up Windows 10 machines or reloading Steam after not having

91
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,600
it for a while.

92
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,360
Oh, that is interesting, you know, I did get mine on a fresh Pop OS setup for gaming that

93
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,360
I recently set up.

94
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,360
Hmm.

95
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,360
Mm hmm.

96
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,360
Mm hmm.

97
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,400
There's an increase in Chinese users that are running pirated versions of Windows 10

98
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,400
on Steam.

99
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,400
So that makes a difference as well.

100
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,400
I'm not kidding.

101
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,020
That's actually one of the one of the things that's been attributed in here.

102
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,460
And then you have to kind of just think that just increased usage in general.

103
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:50,440
So people that maybe weren't normally online, but are on Windows came online to play Cyberpunk

104
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,440
2077.

105
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,000
I mean, it was the most hyped game of the year.

106
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,100
Well, and even just over the holiday periods, I know I've seen some friends I don't always

107
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,200
or even frequently see on Steam suddenly popping back up with, you know, a little time over

108
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,040
the holidays to boot their Windows box back up.

109
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,040
100%.

110
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,040
Same here, Wes.

111
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,320
You know, I'm on Steam a couple of times a week at the most really just to play games

112
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,160
with my kids.

113
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,320
And I see more people on there than ever playing Cyberpunk and other games right now.

114
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,680
I've been trying it out on Stadia, figured put my Stadia subscription to use.

115
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,960
And I've been playing it on the Koda radio pre show for about three weeks straight.

116
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,520
And it's been fine, you know, just fine, really.

117
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,800
Stadia has actually done a pretty decent job.

118
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,000
You're almost making me want to check Stadia out again, just because I mean, I'm not probably

119
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,440
not going to build a rig just right now for Cyberpunk, but I could play it on Stadia.

120
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,440
No problem.

121
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,040
Yeah, especially if you can get like a Stadia credit like I had or something.

122
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,480
So you're not paying full price for the game, because remember, you can't use it off of

123
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,480
Stadia.

124
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,480
Right.

125
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,480
Oh, yeah.

126
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,480
Yeah.

127
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:58,120
But yeah, so as things now point, it looks like the Linux market percentage on Steam

128
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,480
is around 0.74%.

129
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,680
So we were at, we were really close to 1%.

130
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,920
We've now slid back to 0.74%.

131
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,800
And Mac OS is at 2.74%.

132
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:16,480
And Windows 96.51%.

133
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,880
We're coming for you, Windows.

134
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,880
We are.

135
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,680
And it does make me wonder, how do the folks over at Valve actually view this?

136
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,780
You know, because we're looking at it from one direction, surely there's a bunch of folks

137
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:30,400
over in the, you know, Windows gaming camp laughing at us as usual.

138
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,400
But it doesn't seem like Valve has really slacked off on continuing to build and work

139
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,120
on Proton and continue those things.

140
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,880
I just hope that, you know, some of the folks there internally get the sense that I think

141
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,600
we've had on the show and in the community that it's a better time than ever to be a

142
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,600
Linux gamer.

143
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,480
I'm gaming way more than I have in like the past five years.

144
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,040
And I just hope that momentum continues.

145
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,160
Great points all around.

146
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,740
I'm gaming more on Linux than I ever have in a while too.

147
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,280
My kids are as well.

148
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,160
And I think your point is well taken.

149
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,440
The reason why we care about this number, even though it is, I mean, let's be honest,

150
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,880
it's a rather insignificant number, I think maybe that's why we care about it so much

151
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:13,420
is it clearly has made such a difference that Valve has invested as much as it has into

152
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,240
gaming on Linux.

153
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,120
And we are trying to understand the logic, justification and likelihood that it will

154
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,120
continue.

155
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,800
That's what we're doing here with these numbers.

156
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,960
That's the conversation that's not being had is we are just trying to piece together what

157
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,540
is Valve's motivation here and my God, will they please keep doing it?

158
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:35,640
And if these numbers go the wrong way, I think the unspoken worry here is that Valve will

159
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:43,820
just give up and say, Jesus, look at this 96.5% of our user base is on Windows.

160
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,940
We're kidding ourselves here.

161
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,840
They never built that store that put us out of business.

162
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,840
Right.

163
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,080
You got to hope that, you know, Gabe's involved in that there's not some bean counters somewhere

164
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,720
that looks at that and then looks at the amount they're spending on engineers or contracts

165
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,560
working on it and say, this doesn't add up.

166
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:02,680
And Eric, you're pointing out that they could do a better job at just answering some of

167
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,680
these questions around how the survey works.

168
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,440
Yeah, I've always been kind of frustrated when you see these surveys out there.

169
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,760
But I did like Knochel's approach back when Will Cook was on the desktop team and they

170
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,200
did that nice blog post on kind of the metrics that they got at a glance.

171
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,960
But as a numbers guy, I do wish there was a bit more information on how they exactly

172
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,040
identify which, say, Linux user they send the survey to.

173
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,640
Like you said, Chris, you didn't get one forever, it seems like.

174
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,160
I mean, what's their policy or what's their procedures around that?

175
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,400
It just would be nice to know.

176
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,400
Yeah.

177
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:42,200
And it's definitely not just if it's a new install or not, because I install Steam on

178
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,000
just about every laptop or machine I review.

179
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,840
And that's about one a month or somewhere around there, right?

180
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,440
And I'm doing that 12 times a year, and I'm still not getting the survey.

181
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,200
So yeah, I agree, Eric.

182
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,200
Some transparency there.

183
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,640
We at least have to answer some questions about how that all works.

184
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,100
All right.

185
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,080
We can probably cover the rest of that if you guys have any other comments from the

186
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:11,120
Mumble Room in the post show, because I think people probably care more about this next

187
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,720
story to tell you the truth.

188
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,680
Because I got fired up when I read this.

189
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:20,880
I agree with Linus, ECC RAM matters, error correcting code memory.

190
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,560
And he says it quote, absolutely matters in a fun holiday mailing thread.

191
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,360
As ever, Linus was happy to share a little more detail around his opinions and said that

192
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:38,520
Intel has been instrumental in killing the whole ECC industry with its horribly bad market

193
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,520
segmentation.

194
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:44,640
Intel has been detrimental to the whole industry into users because of their bad and misguided

195
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,720
policies with respect to ECC.

196
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:54,000
Seriously, the arguments against ECC were always complete and utter garbage.

197
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,240
Now even the memory manufacturers are starting to do ECC internally, because they finally

198
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,280
owned up to the fact that they absolutely have to.

199
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:10,040
And the menu memory manufacturers claim it's because of economics and the lower power.

200
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,880
But they are lying bastards.

201
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,320
Let me once again point out Row Hammer and how these problems have existed for several

202
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,780
generations already.

203
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:26,840
But these effers happily sold broken hardware to consumers and claimed it was an attack

204
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,760
when it was always just we're cutting corners.

205
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:35,120
Man, this is a classic brutal Linus take down.

206
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,120
He went on to say in this rather lengthy post, the modern DRAM is so reliable that it doesn't

207
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:47,400
need ECC was always a bedtime story for children that have been dropped on their heads a bit

208
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,400
too many times.

209
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,040
Yeah, I'm pissed about it.

210
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,400
You can find me complaining about this literally for decades now.

211
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,800
I don't want to say I was right.

212
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,360
I just want this fixed and I want ECC.

213
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,360
AMD did it.

214
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,360
Intel didn't.

215
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:09,560
Wow, man, like I thought, OK, here's what I really liked about why this happened is

216
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:16,560
I thought I was the jerk that was just going on about ECC all the time and that it really

217
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,400
was just like in my head that my systems with ECC were way better because obviously, if

218
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:27,000
ECC RAM actually made your system more stable, this is what I thought, obviously, if that

219
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,520
actually worked, it would be everywhere.

220
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,880
It'd be in our phones.

221
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,880
It'd be in our desktops.

222
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,880
Right.

223
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,880
Here's this better way to do it.

224
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,880
Why are we doing it?

225
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,960
But I always like, gosh, you know, I've had workstation desktop workstation machines and

226
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:45,160
servers with ECC RAM, and I've had lots of desktops and laptops and even servers that

227
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,320
don't have ECC RAM.

228
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,880
And unquestionably, in my personal hands-on experience, those systems with error correcting

229
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,720
code are more reliable.

230
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,560
I like this reminder of Linus's deep hardware background and interest here.

231
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,520
And the whole history is kind of interesting.

232
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:06,320
I know there was a lot of stuff being discussed around Google's rise as suddenly the data

233
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,240
center was taken over by, you know, just cheap Intel boxes and some of these bigger companies

234
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,760
just sort of trying to handle all these corrections in software and sort of preaching like, look,

235
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,560
you can save on your hardware budgets.

236
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,640
Don't bother with the fancy ECC stuff.

237
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,520
You know, just make sure you've got redundant calculations and that you're handling these

238
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,080
sorts of sometimes failures in software.

239
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:31,240
But especially these days, it just seems like if we need our computers to work right, security

240
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,160
is more important than ever.

241
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,520
Everything's interconnected and online.

242
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,640
And we've already solved this, right?

243
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,800
I mean, why can't you just buy it for the machine that you want to run your software

244
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,800
on?

245
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,800
Yeah.

246
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:48,440
And it also, I think, really gives us kind of insight into some of the blame that Linus

247
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,720
puts on Intel for harming the industry.

248
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,520
You and I were just doing a review of a lot of the stories for 2020 on the latest Linux

249
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,920
Action News.

250
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,120
And when we were going through those, you see several times where Linus is pinning something

251
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,560
directly on Intel.

252
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,440
And I think you might agree, although I'd be curious if you don't, when you kind of

253
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,860
go through what Linus has said about Intel over 2020 chronologically, the more the year

254
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,400
goes on, the more hostile towards Intel he seems to be getting.

255
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:25,400
And then you start to see even Greg Kh starting to take shots at Intel as the year wraps up.

256
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,400
Oh, yeah.

257
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,400
No, I definitely think that's true.

258
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,840
And it's interesting because obviously they've got, you know, a long history, both in the

259
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,640
industry at large and, of course, just working together because Intel's, you know, contributes

260
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,620
a whole bunch of great open source work to the kernel and to the Linux and open source

261
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,120
community generally.

262
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:47,400
But I think we're all really starting to feel some of their missteps that they really aren't

263
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,640
on a solid course or at least haven't been.

264
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
Yeah.

265
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,640
Yep.

266
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,640
And that's starting to hurt.

267
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,840
I know we have AMD, but it's interesting times ahead for Intel.

268
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,920
It's clear that the pressure is on like never before.

269
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,120
So you have Linus laying this pressure down.

270
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:08,040
He even goes on later in the post to compliment and commend AMD for their more broad support

271
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,400
of ECC RAM, even on consumer desktop hardware.

272
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,900
You have Apple, of course, with the M1 chip.

273
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,420
Even RISC-V applies pressure.

274
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,200
You have all of these pressures that are getting applied.

275
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:23,680
And then you bring in AMD, who is compatible with the x86 platform.

276
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,160
It's a tremendous amount of pressure.

277
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,640
You have to figure something's going to give.

278
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,080
It'll be interesting to watch anyway.

279
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:35,440
I mean, there's even more pressure from like investment advisors and capital groups who

280
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,200
maybe even are pushing for Intel to sort of abandon their own system of having their own

281
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200
fabs.

282
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,080
Now, I don't know that that's going to happen anytime soon, but probably the next two, three

283
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,720
years will be very instructive for what's next.

284
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,200
I have thoughts about where Intel's going right now with their current processors.

285
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,200
But we'll get to that later.

286
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,400
I'll mention that maybe in a bit in the show.

287
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,640
There's so much really, boy, you look at it from a New Year's perspective.

288
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,080
It's kind of exciting how much is going to, you can tell there's a lot that's going to

289
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,080
shift this year.

290
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,600
It's going to be a big year for this kind of stuff.

291
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,800
lino.com slash unplugged.

292
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:15,720
Go there to receive a $100 60-day credit towards your new account and you support the show.

293
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,720
And $100 in like Linode terms is a lot.

294
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,400
You can really build out some significant cool projects, try things out, do a test migration

295
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,400
of Nextcloud.

296
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,240
I mean, you name it.

297
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,520
We right now are using Linode for everything.

298
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:35,160
The show notes now that we're doing this on, we've recently spun up, thanks to Alex's help,

299
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,780
a new instance of HedgeDock.

300
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,160
If you're not familiar with that, it used to be called Code EMD.

301
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,200
It's a real-time markdown collaboration tool.

302
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,200
Just dominates.

303
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:49,560
Anything like Google Docs, if you're doing real-time markdown collaboration.

304
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,440
And you can self-host it on Linode in seconds.

305
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,760
Just get started by going to linode.com slash unplugged.

306
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:59,080
You know, I was just looking at our Matrix server that we have on Linode.

307
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:03,260
And Matrix is an interesting use case because there's some scenarios, like when a user connects

308
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:11,040
that has a lot of rooms and stuff, that initial login can put a significant load on the Matrix

309
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,040
server, Synapse.

310
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,040
Yeah, there's some work to do over there.

311
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:19,400
I'm just reviewing the CPU usage from the last few days.

312
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,320
You can even see as the shows are live, the things spin up, the disk I.O. rate spins up.

313
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:30,280
The way Linode makes it possible to view all of this in their dashboard is really, really

314
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,280
smart.

315
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,000
It's laid out in a way where you get all the information you need right away.

316
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,240
So it's kind of in these sections.

317
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,640
The first section up on the screen, and by the way, it's all beautifully designed.

318
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,320
But the first section up's like, it's your details you need to know.

319
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,320
How many cores?

320
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,320
How much RAM?

321
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,240
What's your IP?

322
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,920
And what's your SSH access?

323
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:51,200
Like you hit this button, copy it to your pasteboard, copy it to your clipboard, and

324
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,760
log right in using this.

325
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,720
And then you scroll down and you get all of the CPU and disk and network information.

326
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,880
And we actually get a fair amount of IPv6 traffic too, but nothing like we do on the

327
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,760
IPv4 side.

328
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,760
But you get all of this.

329
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,720
And I can see, you know what, we're doing really well.

330
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,040
We've proportioned this when this system burst during the start of a live stream.

331
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:19,760
We're getting up there in usage, 85%, maybe 90% on a really busy day, but we're not maxing

332
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,760
this box out.

333
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,180
And I can tell that, yep, we have specced this one just right for what we're doing.

334
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:31,040
And it makes it so simple to see that or add storage or tweak things or do backups, which

335
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:36,640
again, because this is a community server, as a responsibility to our community, we want

336
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,420
to make sure that we have a backup of this thing if something goes wrong.

337
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:44,840
So I can go over to the backup tab and I can see, yeah, three minutes and 17 seconds ago,

338
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,140
there was a backup.

339
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,200
It's really great.

340
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,940
You can also take manual snapshots, like we might do that before a big matrix upgrade.

341
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:56,760
There's all kinds of things you can do through the dashboard that make managing a cloud server

342
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,000
really simple, even if you're not an expert.

343
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,120
And if you are an expert, things are just a click away to really take it to the next

344
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,120
level.

345
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,800
And the node costs 30% to 50% less than major cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, or

346
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,800
Azure.

347
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:14,000
So it's a nice balance of technology for the price with the optimal machines, SSD storage,

348
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,720
40 gigabit connections, 11 data centers all over the world.

349
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,220
And they're true Linux users, like as a company, like they're fans of Linux and God, I just

350
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,600
love that about them too.

351
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,280
And they're independently owned.

352
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,540
They've been around forever.

353
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,040
They started three years before AWS.

354
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,360
They're independent and they're the largest independent cloud provider.

355
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:42,200
So go check them out at linode.com slash unplugged, get that $100 credit, support the show.

356
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,360
And it lets Linode know that, yeah, we're getting some investment when we support open

357
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,860
source media, when we support independent media, and they can then turn around and make

358
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,920
that for free.

359
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,740
We get a return on that investment and everybody wins.

360
00:19:53,740 --> 00:20:00,220
So thanks for supporting our sponsors, linode.com slash unplugged.

361
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:04,280
So I have a story in here that I think at first pass.

362
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,900
It's like, why is this on Linux Unplugged?

363
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:11,920
Because the story headline is Microsoft is building a new Outlook app for Windows and

364
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,240
the Mac powered by web technologies.

365
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,880
Chris, this is a Linux show.

366
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,880
You know that, right?

367
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,880
Right.

368
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,900
And you know what's also funny is how the tech press doesn't know what this stuff is.

369
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,480
They don't just say electron, right?

370
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,840
This is windowscentral.com.

371
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,100
Microsoft owns electron.

372
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,760
Why not just say they're going to use electron?

373
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,880
Why say web technologies?

374
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,320
But the idea is that they're going to build a universal Outlook client for Windows and

375
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,520
Mac as far as the press calls it, that also replaces the default mail and calendar apps

376
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,240
on Windows 10 when it's ready.

377
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,520
That's how far they're going to go.

378
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:49,580
The new project is codenamed Monarch, and it's based already on the Outlook web app.

379
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:55,840
So if you're familiar with Outlook web app, which I am roughly familiar with, that's essentially

380
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,840
what it's going to be.

381
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,840
Yeah.

382
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,060
And I mean, this kind of makes sense.

383
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:04,240
Outlook Monarch is basically the end goal for Microsoft's one Outlook vision, which

384
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:10,000
aims to build a single Outlook client that works across the PC, Mac and the web.

385
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,640
They really just want to replace existing desktop clients with just one app built with

386
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,480
the same technologies that they already have to use to leverage those web versions.

387
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,020
And I don't know about you, but even on the platforms I have that have that native Outlook

388
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,800
app, I end up just using the web one anyway.

389
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:30,240
Yeah, it is a lot better than the battle days of Exchange.

390
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,120
It's gotten a lot better, and it works just fine on Linux in a browser.

391
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,240
Microsoft told Zach at Windows Central that they will do native integrations where possible.

392
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,840
They're going to try to make it feel like a native application, look like a native application,

393
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,720
offer offline storage, notifications and more.

394
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:53,080
But you have to figure, like they are doing now with some of their other applications,

395
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:58,200
VS Code, which is also an Electron app, they're probably going to release the sucker for Linux

396
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,480
too.

397
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:05,480
And I think it will totally freaking dominate on Linux when they do.

398
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:11,640
I think it will destroy the Thunderbird market share for anyone who's in a corporate environment

399
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:17,040
that needs solid calendar integration with the rest of the company, be it Google Apps,

400
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,860
Microsoft Exchange, Office 365, whatever it might be.

401
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:26,000
If you are in the corporate world, and I think this even applies to you, Wes, imagine if

402
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,480
you could have an Outlook client that ties in perfectly with the day job, it does good

403
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,920
with the reminders that you can accept meeting invites, you can create meeting invites, you

404
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:40,400
get the directory, everything works as a full-fledged client like your coworkers on Windows and

405
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,360
Mac, you'd probably be compelled to use that.

406
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,080
Yeah, I definitely would, especially if you've got some of those nicer features.

407
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:51,080
The web version works well enough, but yeah, there's some nice desktop integrations you

408
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,840
get if you go the full Electron route.

409
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,840
Yes.

410
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,920
And I have a ton of old school nostalgia love for Thunderbird.

411
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,440
I still think it's a great personal email client.

412
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,520
I have it installed.

413
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,520
I have it.

414
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,520
Totally agree.

415
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,080
I like that's like all the family like, happy holidays and Merry Christmas emails that I

416
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,900
sent out, did them all from Thunderbird, you know, connected to my Gmail account.

417
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:20,680
That's great, but for the two years that I was an employee at a company that had lots

418
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:25,840
of meetings and did everything by calendar, it was a big part of the company culture,

419
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,440
I spent that entire two years struggling on a daily basis trying to make things work.

420
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:38,480
I tried MailSpring, I tried applications that house web apps inside a giant local application.

421
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:45,880
I tried Kmail, Thunderbird, Evolution, Geary, everything, MailSpring got abandoned, which

422
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,040
was already a mail Electron app that sort of had the best integration and made it really

423
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,760
easy to work with calendar invites, but MailSpring was abandoned.

424
00:23:53,760 --> 00:24:01,940
And to this day, I've just kind of resigned to using the Google Gmail web app whenever

425
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:07,840
I am working on any kind of serious correspondence, even just serious correspondence and where

426
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,320
I want my address book and I want calendar abilities and all of that, I just use the

427
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,320
web app.

428
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,320
Yeah.

429
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,320
Same here, right?

430
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,320
I mean, the web email, basically.

431
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,320
Yeah.

432
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,480
And I pine for a local email client.

433
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,120
I prefer local email.

434
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,560
I prefer a local window.

435
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:28,040
I like actually having as few applications in my browser as possible.

436
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,680
And I would absolutely give this a try.

437
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,760
I'm at that point.

438
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,040
I wonder, too, if this might be, you know, just one more bolster sort of to reassure

439
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,080
corporate IT departments, you know, sure, like you can have your Linux desktop maybe

440
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,280
and you've gotten some special permission or you've just set it up without asking.

441
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,760
But suddenly, one weird thing doesn't work and they're like, well, you know, we were

442
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,360
tested just fine in the desktop app on Windows and Mac and I don't know what your problem

443
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,360
is.

444
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,840
But if suddenly there is this, you know, single blessed web powered version and it runs on

445
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:02,580
Linux, I mean, I remember less of four years ago and I had to run Windows VM just for Outlook

446
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:07,280
integration because there was some stuff that OWA still couldn't do.

447
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,800
That future, I mean, that looks like we're way beyond this.

448
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,520
I bought every version of Crossover Office.

449
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:19,240
I bought every release of Xandros OS, which was a Debian based KDE desktop environment

450
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:27,240
that shipped Crossover integrated so you could even put the Office 98 or whatever it was,

451
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:33,040
2003, probably into the CD-ROM drive and it would even recognize the autostart file and

452
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,000
just give you the full install experience.

453
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,380
But think about this Wes, for better or for worse, think about the complete picture once

454
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:47,000
Outlook is released, Fedora and Ubuntu out of the box during the installation offer Active

455
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,040
Directory integration.

456
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:53,600
You log in, you've got Microsoft Edge to browse your corporate intranet.

457
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,160
You've got Microsoft Teams to do all of your team collaboration Slack style chat.

458
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,320
You've got Microsoft Outlook to do all of your corporate email correspondence.

459
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,580
You see where I'm going with this, VS Code, et cetera.

460
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,020
Don't forget.NET Core, right?

461
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,160
That's available too.

462
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:12,640
And let's be honest, they're not going to stop with Outlook.

463
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,160
Microsoft didn't add Electron to their arsenal of technologies that they own so that way

464
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,920
they could just let it piss off in the corner.

465
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,800
They're starting with Outlook because Outlook is the high bar.

466
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:29,200
They're starting high and they're going to knock out Outlook and they're coming for Word,

467
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,720
they're coming for Excel, they're coming for PowerPoint, they're coming for the entire

468
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,240
Office 365 suite, which are already web apps.

469
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,520
And then they're going to ship them on Linux.

470
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,520
It's interesting too.

471
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:45,800
It does sort of seem like it's a more reinforcement that the Windows side of the house really

472
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:51,760
is no longer the dominant, you know, tastemaker internally because they've clearly aligned

473
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,720
to the goal of like, we just want to get our stuff in the hands of as many people as possible,

474
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,680
regardless of if they have to use our other platform.

475
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:04,480
It's pretty wild to see this coming and it may not be until the end of the year until

476
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,080
we really see anything materialized.

477
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,640
And then it may be a while after that before we see the Linux support.

478
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:15,300
Just like with Edge, I wouldn't be surprised that if Microsoft takes the approach of they

479
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:20,440
focus on the Mac and Windows versions first because it's a narrower problem scope.

480
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,320
And then once they have those shipping, they begin working on a Linux alpha and beta.

481
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,320
Yes.

482
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,600
And I mean, the same thing happened with Teams.

483
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,200
It was quite some time before the Linux version came out.

484
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,880
But hey, now it's here and seems to be working pretty darn well.

485
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,560
Oh, live update from Popey in the IRC.

486
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,000
He just checked around on their GitHub and it looks like the developer popped up 20 days

487
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
ago for Mailspring.

488
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,840
Oh, thank goodness.

489
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,840
So I'll be looking into that.

490
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,720
So maybe Mailspring is still alive.

491
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:49,160
It may save me yet from an outlook future, but yeah, they're not going to have anything

492
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:54,440
until like maybe even 2022 is when you may actually see it start replacing the apps.

493
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,680
They may have like an early version build client that you can get on Windows or Mac

494
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,960
by the end of this year, but replacing the default application on the Windows desktop,

495
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,960
that's a 2022 thing.

496
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,880
So it's going to be a bit and the Linux beta will be somewhere in there, right?

497
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,960
We shall see.

498
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,520
We shall see.

499
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:15,200
There's also just a couple of community things we want to touch on before we move on.

500
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:22,360
Number one is Fosdom, which is a pretty significant conference every single year, Europe's largest

501
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,360
free and open source conference.

502
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:29,240
Thousands of people, I think last year it was nearly 9,000 people, take over a campus

503
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:35,760
in Belgium for a weekend and turn it into quite the event, 800 talks, 50 tracks, hundreds

504
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,760
of exhibitors.

505
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,700
It's really intense.

506
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,560
It's like I guess the most intense of all of them.

507
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:45,560
I've always wanted to go and maybe this year I can because it looks like the Matrix project

508
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:51,840
reached out to them and said, hey, we know you want to be virtual for February of 2021.

509
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,000
I think we can facilitate that.

510
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Isn't that interesting?

511
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,960
I mean, Matrix has all kinds of great technology under the hood to make this happen and well,

512
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:06,320
you know, thankfully Fosdom 2020 snuck in just a few weeks before this whole pandemic

513
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,080
really got into full swing.

514
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:14,560
Of course, with Fosdom 2021 happening just in February, this upcoming February, you got

515
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,320
to start figuring this out right now.

516
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:22,760
I don't think we're going to be in any state to, you know, do an in-person one yet.

517
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,520
So they just have to start planning for it.

518
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,880
But Matrix, Wes, I mean, it's brilliant, right?

519
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,200
It's an open protocol.

520
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,360
There's something great about that for an open source conference like Fosdom, but the

521
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:39,020
video stuff and all of that is really still early on Matrix and really Elements the only

522
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:42,280
client that has the most complete implementation right now.

523
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:47,260
Yeah, I suppose in one sense, maybe that's risky or we'll see what parts all get adopted,

524
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,720
how far the integration goes.

525
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,680
But on the other side, that might be a really good sort of dogfooding stress test for some

526
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,120
of those technologies.

527
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:59,400
The other part that I like about this is it seems like more and more of the Matrix team,

528
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,540
they're reaching out, they're pushing Matrix, they're trying to get it into places that

529
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:05,880
make sense, whether that's, you know, various government things that are looking for protocols

530
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,560
or open source conferences.

531
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:12,160
And I both like that as a way to build Matrix.

532
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:17,160
But I think it also speaks well to just the project structure and internal organization

533
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,920
and they know they've got time for this.

534
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:23,760
This is something they can take on and actively continue to develop Matrix.

535
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,600
So it's just a good sign to me.

536
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,960
Yeah, and I'll push forward certain things in Matrix.

537
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,400
It looks like they're going to use a good helping of Jitsi in here to handle some of

538
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,040
the video heavy lifting.

539
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,040
Of course.

540
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,040
That's brilliant.

541
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:42,540
So what you're going to see from this is a notch up in the network effect of Matrix.

542
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:46,600
And that I'm particularly excited about because I think you're going to see several projects

543
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:52,240
over this next year switch their chat and collaboration infrastructure over to Matrix.

544
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,440
There's some that are in conversations about doing it right now.

545
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,520
That's going to increase the amount of Matrix users.

546
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:02,280
An event like FOSDEM taking place on Matrix, that's going to increase the number of Matrix

547
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,280
users.

548
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,800
And we're going to start to see this network effect where something that's based on an

549
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:13,440
open standard that has open source implementations that is really kind of this next generation

550
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:19,680
protocol for the web or its own layer on the internet, it's going to have more users now.

551
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:23,560
And that's going to be a net win for free software just in general.

552
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:29,120
So by FOSDEM doing this, I actually think the contribution is more significant than

553
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,380
just their event.

554
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,720
It's actually fairly significant.

555
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,220
And even if the effect just has the Matrix team and the element team work a little bit

556
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:40,100
harder in more of a sprint style to get ready for February to have some of these features

557
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:46,520
more polished, even that is a great net benefit for all of us.

558
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:54,080
And then last, rounding out the community news, just a brief mention that KDE Plasma 5.20.5

559
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,720
shipped today.

560
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:01,080
And it's just a real nice polishing of the 5.20 series.

561
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:05,800
And this is, I think, a great indicator of the stage that the Plasma project is in right

562
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,120
now.

563
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,600
They announced today as we're recording this release, and it just fixes for visual glitches

564
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:18,560
that maybe impacted GTK3 apps or System Tray had an arrow problem that was hiding some

565
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,560
things.

566
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:24,040
And the one that is the most significant that drove me fricking batty, and I'm very happy

567
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:29,480
to see it patched, is there was an issue with the Plasma Network Manager applet that would

568
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,980
jump to a different network.

569
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:35,360
So as you're searching and it's finding the networks of Wi-Fi networks, you click Connect

570
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,640
and start entering the password, and then it jumps and the connect registers for a different

571
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,760
wireless network.

572
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,140
And then you go through it over and over again.

573
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,400
It was infuriating.

574
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,960
And it actually struck me while using OpenSUSE of Tumbleweed, and at first I thought it was

575
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,040
some weird bug, but I quickly figured out it was a Plasma thing.

576
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:57,600
So nice to see that fixed, because if you've been using recent Plasma and you've run into

577
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,600
that, you know how painful that was.

578
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,520
It was really bad.

579
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:06,960
I was also pretty pleased to see better support for WebRTC-powered meetings and screencast

580
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,200
and stuff like that if you're using the Plasma Wayland session, which I know not a whole

581
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,720
bunch of people are, but it's exactly the kind of thing that needs to get solved if

582
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,760
we're going to have more Plasma Wayland adoption.

583
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:21,520
Yeah, if you're using Plasma for your day job and you're on Wayland, you sometimes need

584
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,000
to participate in meetings where you're sharing your screen.

585
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,560
And so to see that kind of stuff get plumbed in is really nice.

586
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:35,040
So 5.21, so the next big release of Plasma, which is scheduled for February, has a new

587
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,280
system monitor app in it.

588
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,480
And I gave it a go because it's available already for some distributions.

589
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,400
It's just Plasma System Monitor, and it's going to replace ksysguard.

590
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:49,840
Now these are the tools that let you look at memory usage, process usage, CPU usage

591
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:55,280
on the Plasma desktop, sort of like akin to Task Manager on Windows.

592
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,680
And it's getting a really nice upgrade in Plasma.

593
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,960
I'll leave the link in the show notes for you guys to go check it out, but it's a completely

594
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:07,040
rewritten UI, and you can now also easily create and edit pages where you can put your

595
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:11,200
own items on this dashboard, sort of akin to Perfmon on Windows.

596
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,840
Just tons of categories of stuff in there, and you can put a nice heads up display.

597
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,880
It looks good.

598
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,920
And this, in my opinion, Wes, these types of system monitor apps where you get an insight

599
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:24,200
into what your box is doing, they can never be good enough.

600
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,160
Like there's always more work to be done, and this thing's sharp looking.

601
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,280
Yes, it is.

602
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:33,160
And actually, as noted by Nate Graham, who we just had on the show in episode 385, notes

603
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:37,120
that it's been in development for almost two years.

604
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:42,800
And hopefully, it will eventually replace ksysguard once it's a little more tested out

605
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,040
in the wild.

606
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,680
But for now, it stays independent.

607
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,680
But you're totally right.

608
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:50,280
I mean, even Windows, they've improved a lot of their resources.

609
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,280
They've got pretty graphs now.

610
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,960
If you want to go just pull up your task manager and check out what your system is doing.

611
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,680
And even though we're going to promote all the next latest top replacement tools in the

612
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:05,040
shell, of course, or just talk about NetData, I think for users who just, you know, are

613
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,040
into Linux, are starting things up, or just want to have a native app that shows what

614
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,760
their system is doing, it's important that this works well.

615
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,000
Because the kernel in our user space, we have all the tools there.

616
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
It just needs the plumbing and a little bit of prettiness.

617
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:25,080
All right, we have a spot of housekeeping this week, a few things to mention.

618
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,580
Number one, I just kind of referred to it earlier.

619
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:32,880
But if you have not yet checked out Linux Action News 170, there was a lot of open source

620
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,200
development in a very crazy 2020.

621
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,180
And we recap some of the standout moments that you should know about.

622
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,960
And there's a few items in there you may have missed.

623
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,640
So it's a great episode to get caught up on some of the things that happened in 2020.

624
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:51,000
With linuxactionnews.com slash one seven zero.

625
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,660
Also, I'm going to encourage you to check out this week's coder radio episode 395 coder

626
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,240
dot show slash 395.

627
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,160
It's not out as we record yet.

628
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,700
But I've already recorded it with Mike.

629
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:10,000
And I was sent the XPS 13 developer edition that comes pre installed with Ubuntu.

630
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,520
And it has the 11th gen Intel CPU with XE graphics.

631
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:20,660
And I think you're going to be really surprised by my review of that laptop.

632
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:25,960
And we're going to talk about more specifically the XE graphics aspect in next week's episode.

633
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:30,260
Wendell from level one techs is scheduled to join us and geek out on the XE graphics

634
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,540
under Linux.

635
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:36,800
So it'd be good context if you check out coder radio 395 to get an idea of what I was able

636
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,500
to do with that laptop and sort of the situation I find myself in now.

637
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:46,020
So that'll be coder dot show slash 395 later this week.

638
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:51,100
And then that brings us to Sunday, where you can join the love plug every single Sunday

639
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:55,400
at noon Pacific three p.m. Eastern, you can get the mumble information at linux unplug

640
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,540
dot com.

641
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:00,840
And mini Mac, you wanted to put a word out to an upcoming special love love.

642
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,960
Yes, indeed.

643
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:06,280
So first, I hope you all had a good start in 2021.

644
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:11,820
And yeah, we had our first love love meeting for this year last Sunday, and we scheduled

645
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,980
a new recording session.

646
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:19,780
So the subject will be access accessibility features in Linux.

647
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:25,280
So we are talking about assistive tools like screen magnifier, screen reader, and so on.

648
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,180
And the recording will most probably be the 24th of January.

649
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:34,560
We have a community member that would like to share his experience with us.

650
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:40,000
And he also contacted a special guest whose name I will not yet reveal.

651
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,860
All I can say he is a developer for a well known desktop environment project.

652
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:51,900
Now what I would like to do is a call for participation for that talk.

653
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:57,080
If you have some experience with accessibility features in Linux and want to be a speaker

654
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:02,980
during that talk, please contact me either on IRC, Telegram or matrix.

655
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:09,460
So just send a message to Minimac or even simpler, just join the next love love session

656
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:13,280
next Sunday and we can talk about that.

657
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,280
So that's all for me.

658
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,280
Thanks, Chris.

659
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,280
Yeah, great.

660
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,280
That sounds like a fantastic topic.

661
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,480
Again, that's going to be held on the 24th.

662
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,600
And there is a love love matrix channel.

663
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:28,300
If you'd like to get involved in chat there, you can find our matrix info on the website

664
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,300
as well.

665
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:38,320
matrix unplugged.com Okay, so after the show last week, Wes and I looked at each other

666
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,440
and said, What are we going to do about open suits?

667
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,520
Because we get a lot of requests into the show to try it out because it's not a distribution

668
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,680
we cover very often because neither one of us run it on the regular.

669
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:56,640
But we we know there's a lot in the works for open suits over 2021.

670
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,760
And we feel like it was time to check in.

671
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:05,100
And I am intrigued by the idea that I could throw tumbleweed the rolling release on my

672
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,640
laptop.

673
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:12,080
And we could do something like leap on the server, which is the more LTS release.

674
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,320
Isn't that a nice thought?

675
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:17,400
Because there's so much you know, I know we both love arch running that.

676
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,280
But even though we do have a server with arch, we acknowledge that probably you wouldn't

677
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,840
want to have a whole bunch of servers that are arch, right?

678
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,280
Why would you do it that way?

679
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,660
But it's nice to stay in the same ecosystem, we don't have to suddenly switch things out

680
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:32,080
or get used to all the little differences between things.

681
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:36,960
If you could have just one system that could run everywhere, including all those pies that

682
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,960
you have.

683
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,840
I mean, wouldn't that be the dream?

684
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,840
Yeah.

685
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:44,200
And it it does run I'm told, although I have yet to test it, although I think I will put

686
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,880
it on the pi 400.

687
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:52,560
Just to give that a go, I was running it on a Dell laptop that I had in for testing.

688
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,400
And I went with the DVD release.

689
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:00,220
So they still kind of like old school style, I love it, offer various sizes.

690
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:06,040
And then they even offer like an i 586 image if you want, along with the arm and x 64.

691
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:10,560
And then you pick like DVD or net install and as you as the name implies, net install

692
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,880
is just what you need to get the live environment up and then the packages are pulled down from

693
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,880
the repo.

694
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,320
And if you have a fast internet connection, I think that's probably the way to go.

695
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,640
You tried the live version though, Wes, and that was kind of different.

696
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:25,860
Well, I was confused from the start because I mean, you go over to the you know, the get

697
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:29,880
tumbleweed page, and they've got some tabs, if you want to go get you know, you can get

698
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,420
their cubic stuff, you can get the installation and they do have a they have a live tab with

699
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,800
live images.

700
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,740
But right at the top, they say please be aware of the following limitations.

701
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:45,760
They should not be used to install or upgrade tumbleweed, please use the tumbleweed media,

702
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,360
which I think they mean the installation media for that instead.

703
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:53,420
And they also note that these have limited package and driver selection, so they can't

704
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:57,500
be considered an accurate reflection as to whether tumbleweed will work on your hardware

705
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,500
or not.

706
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,000
And you know, that's a fair point and can probably be said of all live CDs.

707
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,760
But it was a little strange to me that although I could kind of try it out, I had to then

708
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:10,840
go get a totally separate installation media just to get things installed.

709
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,080
So I ended up just downloading the net install and doing it that way.

710
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:22,640
Well, see, that's just as confusing as it was for me, because I think about 97.5% of

711
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:28,280
the reason I would get a live disk would be to test how that distribution works with my

712
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,880
hardware.

713
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,880
And then if it works, I run the installer.

714
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:35,960
Now once it's once it's a distro that I know works great, and I'm just going to deploy

715
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,180
it all the time, I prefer having something that just boots right to the installer like

716
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:42,120
their primary media does.

717
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:46,080
But I just thought that the wording around limited package and driver selection, that

718
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:49,640
could just be implying, you know, there's no Nvidia driver here.

719
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,400
Or it could be implying that like it's some sort of super slimmed down kernel, it was

720
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,400
very confusing.

721
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,680
And I'm like, but that's why I use a live CD.

722
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,560
I've also kind of just been spoiled over the years of you know, okay, maybe it doesn't

723
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,440
matter right now when you've got like a test machine that you're using, you still got your

724
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,440
desktop.

725
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:08,880
But if you're someone who just has the one Linux machine, it's really a luxury that unlike

726
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,280
in the Windows world, I can still browse the internet with Firefox from the live CD while

727
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,560
I'm installing these new OS on my machine.

728
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,000
And it kind of sucks to not have that option.

729
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Yeah, yeah.

730
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,560
Yeah, that I remember how cool that used to like Linux is so powerful.

731
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,920
I can I can play solitaire while I'm installing the OS.

732
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:32,520
But so you know, you had to hang around while I'm sitting here downloading the 4.6 gigabyte

733
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:37,640
or 4.28 gigabyte DVD image, which is kind of quaint.

734
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,980
I remember DVDs, but I wanted the full offline experience because I was going to take my

735
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:47,160
laptop home after the show and just do everything from home where I'm on a pretty limited connection

736
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,080
and I actually I want the DVD stuff.

737
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:53,520
So I sit down and I you know, after the download completes, I write to my media and you know,

738
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,960
you and I go our separate ways.

739
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,160
I sit down at home, and I boot off the live media.

740
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:03,800
And I've always really liked the SUSE grub boot screens.

741
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:10,040
I've always thought they just have always looked the best beyond like any other distro.

742
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,480
And I think that still holds true.

743
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,760
They're just they really get that first power on experience nice.

744
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,760
No kidding.

745
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,160
I definitely have that written down in my notes of just this feels slick and professional

746
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,920
and wow.

747
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:28,720
Things kind of then took a bit of a tumble, if you will, but when the installer loaded

748
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:36,520
up and I'm on a 4K screen system and the UI for the installer was so tiny that the entire

749
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:39,840
EULA fit on my screen.

750
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:40,840
There was no scroll bar.

751
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,480
The entire EULA fit.

752
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:50,140
It was absolutely teensy weensy and I couldn't see a way to magnify, you know, to double

753
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:51,520
it or whatever during the installation.

754
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:56,400
But I powered through and the installer got to the point where it seemed like this was

755
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,440
the opportunity for me to put it on Wi-Fi if I wanted to do that.

756
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,720
And boy is that an experience.

757
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,960
It's really old school because you set like you first have to set the encryption type

758
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,560
and it's like default to web and that's on one tab.

759
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:15,520
But then you on a different screen tell it to go scan for SSIDs and then on a different

760
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,520
tab you you set the IP settings and so on and so forth.

761
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:24,120
I mean it was a very strange experience and I wasn't even sure if I was connected to Wi-Fi

762
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,400
after all was said and done.

763
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,400
Did you experience this?

764
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,400
No.

765
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,520
You know thankfully I was installing from an ethernet cable old school so I didn't run

766
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,520
into that.

767
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:37,880
Although I did actually install a few other times in a virtual machine and had some similar

768
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,640
problems getting things connected which surprised me.

769
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:45,840
I obviously did have it connected because later on in the installer I got a prompt that

770
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:49,320
came up and it said the installer has detected a network connection.

771
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,480
If anybody's installed SUSE you've seen this.

772
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,240
Would you like to enable online repos?

773
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,920
And I thought well what are they asking me here?

774
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,640
Like the you know Ubuntu will phrase it would you like to pull down the latest packages

775
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,920
or that is that what they're asking me here?

776
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:07,080
Or they asking me that should I do I just want to make sure I add additional repositories

777
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,880
which I did.

778
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,480
So I said yes and then I saw which ones are checked and I said okay.

779
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,120
But then during the install it seemed like it was clearly pulling down packages from

780
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:21,240
the repository even though I had implicitly decided to use the offline media and it just

781
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:27,760
seems by opting to have online repositories I then started getting packages from the repos

782
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,640
during the installation which is fine except for I was again on a limited LTE connection

783
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,420
and would prefer to save the bandwidth.

784
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,540
You had planned to not do that.

785
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:40,960
You know interestingly on my you know the Netver install version it asked me the exact

786
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,600
same question and I didn't try this maybe I will after the show.

787
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:48,140
I don't know what happens if I would have said no because there weren't any other package

788
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:49,680
sources to use.

789
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,680
Yeah that's a good question right yeah especially on the net install and then the other thing

790
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:59,120
that seemed particularly challenging with the large Dell trackpad is it was registering

791
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,120
clicks weird.

792
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:03,500
I had to get really far down in the corner of the trackpad in a way I don't normally

793
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:07,760
have to do on any other Linux distribution and to kind of make the situation a little

794
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:12,680
more frustrating although yet helpful at the same time every time I would try to like click

795
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:18,560
next and I wasn't in the precise bottom of the of the far left corner of the trackpad

796
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:23,400
I would get a dialog box that came up by Yas that says you seem to have misclicked would

797
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:28,280
you like to swap the buttons but the way the dialog is stated is not actually really clear

798
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:32,520
I wasn't sure what what I'd be swapping and how and I didn't actually mean to do it so

799
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:36,200
then I had like a dialog I had to clear and then I had to go try to click my next button

800
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:40,320
again and I have never had this with this trackpad happened before and I'm not quite

801
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:44,560
sure what was going on there it felt like it was acting like a ps2 mouse but again not

802
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:49,040
really a deal breaker it just made it not quite as smooth as maybe setting up fedora

803
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:53,360
or Ubuntu but you know at the end of the day it was easy to get through I think that's

804
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:56,920
another version where you're not in the same environment right you're not on just a regular

805
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:01,960
desktop that has a program that runs and installs you're in a dedicated installation environment

806
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:07,200
which is simpler it might work really nicely especially at scale but you don't know how

807
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,360
it works or have any of the tools to go fiddle with like display settings I do feel like

808
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:16,180
you get a lot of nice user choice and if that's your thing and it is my thing that's something

809
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:20,280
I love about the openSUSE install I mean you can get access to something like six different

810
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:24,200
desktops depending on how you what options you choose but you get presented with plasma

811
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:28,800
or gnome or other desktop and that's where you get access to more or you get things like

812
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,920
transactional server which is really neat and they give you a little brief descriptions

813
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:37,600
of all of that but once you make your final decisions I really like that it's just it's

814
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:41,720
just it goes man and then I stepped away to go get a snack and came back and I was at

815
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:48,040
my desktop it was just done because I chose to use auto login for the test and it was

816
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:51,440
kind of nice to be honest it like the computer just took care of itself and just finished

817
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,440
the installation and brought me to my desktop and I thought that was a slick experience

818
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:58,320
yeah no that waiting for you to remove the USB drive or any of that other stuff that

819
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:02,000
you you figure out and you know I was I was kind of impressed with the installation in

820
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,280
general it it did feel kind of enterprising I mean like one of the first things that

821
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,720
it said to me was searching for available products yeah probing the source type and

822
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:15,440
I was like okay what's going on here and of course as you sort of skipped over a little

823
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,940
bit there's also a license agreement that you're prompted with right at the start which

824
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:23,520
is not something I'm always used to when I'm installing Linux but the flip side of that

825
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:28,800
is that it felt mature there's a ton of translations available and as someone who loves to complain

826
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,400
about Anaconda more than I should I was really impressed with the disk setup tooling the

827
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:37,600
partitioning yeah especially how I could go into expert mode and it gave me a choice of

828
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:41,320
do you want to start fresh or do you want to keep things how we've set them up and then

829
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:45,120
just tweak them a little in expert mode and I thought that was really well done and I

830
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:48,840
liked its suggestions I thought they were solid and I wasn't sure what it would do since

831
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:52,560
I had an existing distro on there and it took care of just tidying it all up for me and

832
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:57,120
doing a nice you know better fs setup which is part of what I wanted to play with I was

833
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:01,000
disappointed to see that the Wi-Fi setup that I did in the installer didn't hold over to

834
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,320
the installed OS so then I had to go through setting up Wi-Fi again which is where I got

835
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:10,720
bit by that current plasma bug of the menu jumping around so like oh I always think that's

836
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:15,160
nice you know when you get like a like on Ubuntu or something you get the live environment

837
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:18,920
on the Wi-Fi network and then you reboot into the installed OS and it still has all the

838
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:23,000
Wi-Fi stuff like I just think that's slick and I'd love to see them be able to do that

839
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:32,000
if they could but I was plagued immediately with performance issues on the plasma desktop

840
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,440
on open Zeus a tumbleweed on this Dell with an NVIDIA graphics card and the easiest way

841
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:44,520
you'd see it manifest was I'd fire open krunner which is the plasma application launcher it's

842
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:47,760
such like a muscle memory thing that I do alt space and I start just typing the command

843
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:54,160
I hit enter but on this installation I hit alt space and I'd start typing I hit enter

844
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:59,120
and then I'd see like my web browser or whatever I'm using freak out because all of the input

845
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:04,400
had gone into my active window and then even after after I'd come to that realization of

846
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:09,440
what had just happened then the krunner menu came down and it was consistently laggy like

847
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:14,940
this throughout the system so I thought well this has to be a video acceleration issue

848
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:21,240
because this is a ginormous 4k display and it's doing it all in software right so or

849
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:25,900
whatever whatever the whatever it does I better install the NVIDIA driver do you have any

850
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:31,660
systems where you tried to do the video driver Wes you know actually not yet it's on my list

851
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:37,040
to try I think I'm gonna be leaving the tumbleweed around on at least one system for a while

852
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:41,600
but on on the Intel systems I was testing it on no no problem I was I was yeah I was

853
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:47,000
really pleased with performance yeah works great now I don't mean any disrespect to the

854
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:54,200
project but holy shit this is bad oh my god I cannot believe it's still in this state

855
00:50:54,200 --> 00:51:01,040
so I found some great documentation that even as a 20 plus Linux user your user Linux user

856
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:05,800
I can I can kind of understand what they're saying but I essentially have to use a series

857
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:13,240
of tools to figure out what type of NVIDIA card I have and then I have one of two options

858
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:17,640
to install for an NVIDIA driver but none of their documentation covers the use case of

859
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:23,340
using a quadro video card so I was completely left on my own to assume what I'm supposed

860
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:28,740
to do and then once I even get the process of adding the NVIDIA repo and then going through

861
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:33,640
yes to find the different NVIDIA package options for a 50-50 shot of which one might apply

862
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:40,100
to my video card yast would hang during the installation the first time around 64% I'm

863
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:47,120
legitimately long enough that I stepped away came back sat with it for a bit and pondered

864
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:51,880
well I guess do I reboot my system even though it's 64% through installing the NVIDIA driver

865
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:56,320
and got up came back again still there sat down thought hmm yeah I think I'm gonna have

866
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:02,040
to reboot it and then it finished so I reboot my computer and after I installed apparently

867
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:07,440
what was the wrong of a 50-50 shot driver I tried the newest driver there seems to be

868
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:12,960
like a version 400 series and a version 300 series I installed the 400 series because

869
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:19,760
it's a fairly modern quadro video card apparently that was the wrong one so I reboot no video

870
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:25,400
everything's on the Intel still still running real choppy real laggy and and yast helped

871
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:29,040
me uninstall it but I wasn't sure if it cleared up everything or not and so then I installed

872
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:34,280
the older driver and I mean at this point I'm kind of desperate to get the NVIDIA GPU

873
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:38,500
working because the performance is basically unusable the input leg was brutal I was screwing

874
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:42,440
stuff up I just found it to be kind of an awful experience then you combine that with

875
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:47,360
just the newness of having to set up a desktop environment and it's not working right it's

876
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:52,720
it's a frustrating experience and so I thought okay I'll clear out what I installed I'll

877
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,800
install the older driver I install that I reboot I mean I'm following the instructions

878
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:03,400
that are on the wiki and I reboot and it still does not work I've got no real errors that

879
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:07,480
I can follow up on and to this point to this day I just kind of gave up on it so fear I'll

880
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:12,840
come back to it and I wanted to test out other things on the system but that that experience

881
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:18,800
of the process I had to go through feels like it's barely evolved from what it was like

882
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:24,160
seven or eight years ago on desktop Linux to get proprietary graphics working when it

883
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:30,240
was a legit exercise in system administration to get a driver enabled on your box and now

884
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:35,280
we live in an era where it's a checkbox on Fedora and Ubuntu and every other desktop

885
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,400
environment or on arch it's a single package you install or a series of packages a meta

886
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:44,360
package some folks even you know some distributions and projects even have dedicated media for

887
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:47,480
that if you already know that's what you want you know comes with it right there and it

888
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:54,200
was painful it was I remember thinking how this used to be and how it just doesn't need

889
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:59,720
to be like that anymore and I was shocked at the experience was that bad and that that's

890
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:03,080
not something people talk about a lot more but there's other things that it just seemed

891
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:07,520
like off that nobody talks about both Wes and I on different systems couldn't get the

892
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:11,720
ISOs to download using Chrome that particular day we were doing it I don't know why you

893
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:16,080
should go try it see if it downloads on Chrome for you we had to switch to Firefox I actually

894
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:20,120
switched to it just a dedicated downloader to get the ISO to download nobody's talking

895
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:24,080
about that it was weird because it was clearly a link right I could right click and copy

896
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:27,640
the link and I did the same I just pasted it and you know curled curled it down to my

897
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:32,820
file system but it was it was strange and you it's surprising to me maybe it's a new

898
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:37,280
bug I haven't downloaded open source especially tumbleweed for quite some time I will admit

899
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:44,360
but not ideal so then things really went wrong when I tried to get slack working so there's

900
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:50,440
obviously a pretty significant lead that the snap store has in SEO when you search for

901
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:56,240
getting slack on open Sousa because the first like three or four results for me who are

902
00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:02,080
all like do it with snaps but when you go beyond there you discover and maybe you had

903
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:04,740
a different route on this I don't know if you tried this but when you Google around

904
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:10,200
you can find that there are different community repos that are hosting slack for you and this

905
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:14,380
is kind of like PPAs to the next level because instead of it just being a simple straightforward

906
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:19,360
process to add a personal package repository you have to go through this process through

907
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:24,920
yast where it asks you all of these questions and I chose the community repo that looked

908
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:29,620
the most legitimate based on absolutely nothing and then went through the yast process where

909
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:38,000
it had to add five additional repos to make it work and of course it aired out on adding

910
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,000
the third out of the five repos and the process never completed and I never got slack installed

911
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,560
on the machine oh no that is interesting I did I um I kind of cheated there and I went

912
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:51,040
the easy route and I installed it via flat back yeah that's what I'm gonna do that's

913
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:55,400
what I'll have to do and honestly I did that because that's kind of been my go-to for a

914
00:55:55,400 --> 00:56:01,320
while now there's just that sort of set of applications that I just rely on having in

915
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:06,080
you know these sort of containerized universal package formats now just because I know that

916
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:10,380
they're there and I'm pretty sure they'll work wherever I'm gonna run them but you're

917
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:14,760
right you know software availability was one of the things we were wondering as a can I

918
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:20,240
run tumbleweed in place of arch sort of meta question because with arch and you know that

919
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:26,920
it's probably just in the AUR and the AUR might not be simple you should acknowledge

920
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:30,160
that right you're learning more about how the ecosystem works here whereas you're already

921
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:35,720
familiar with arch in the AUR but this sounded a bit more complex.

922
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:40,280
I think it just kind of it really feels like the experience is downgraded when you begin

923
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:44,900
managing software via yast and I know that's probably the opposite opinion that every every

924
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:47,880
user that's listening to the show that loves to use sues probably has the opposite opinion

925
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:51,520
of me and I'm sure the development community for your open sues has the opposite opinion

926
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:58,960
for me but in my using it and mind you I've had sues enterprise server in production I've

927
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:04,040
used yast extensively in production years ago and I think one of the reasons I was first

928
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:09,240
drawn to SUSE when I was new to Linux and I was deployed in production was because I

929
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:13,920
felt like yast was sort of an insurance policy for me.

930
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,880
I knew there were certain things I was always going to be able to configure on these Linux

931
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:23,120
boxes because yast gave me that option and I could do it in yast and that as a configuration

932
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:30,840
tool is powerful and it it it also breeds a lot of loyalty by the user base but now

933
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:37,800
having been away from SUSE for a long time and coming back to it my experience dies every

934
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:47,080
time I go inside yast it it is arduous, tedious, slow, it feels bloated, it never feels native

935
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:53,120
and the software management has to be the absolute slowest and most clunky and require

936
00:57:53,120 --> 00:58:00,400
the absolute most user input of any package management system of any popular Linux distribution.

937
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:06,600
It's an absolutely paper cuts experience at every point and I think people that use SUSE

938
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:10,800
and that have used this for so long are just so used to it being this way or perhaps like

939
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:15,520
the benefits of of what yast brings that they just don't even see it but for me coming from

940
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:19,560
the outside it's a deal breaker for me with this distribution.

941
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:24,360
I kept debating how to feel about it because on one hand I'm kind of really impressed like

942
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:29,560
it's almost a different style of how you interface and manage like a Linux system and there's

943
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:33,120
a lot in there that I like I mean they've thought about a lot of things it's been a

944
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:36,840
project that's been around for a long time there's clearly areas where it's very mature

945
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:41,280
sophisticated and I could really see if I was deploying this in a corporate environment

946
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:45,700
or some sort of you know I was trying to administer all these boxes I needed sameness yast would

947
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:52,980
be killer but as someone more used to assembling arch systems yeah it was kind of a weird black

948
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:58,280
box and I didn't feel it felt like a rogue agent on my machine that left me more confused

949
00:58:58,280 --> 00:58:59,500
than enlightened.

950
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:03,680
And I don't think it's just the pro user like coming from arch angle I also thought about

951
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:09,380
it from a skill set that's applicable to the wider market and when you learn how to do

952
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:13,920
things in yast and you learn how to do it the SUSE way the open SUSE way you're not

953
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:18,880
you're not really learning a skill that's directly translatable to CentOS, RHEL or

954
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:24,260
Ubuntu and early on in my career I think I would have really have disserviced myself

955
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:30,380
had I only learned how to do things the yast way I initially started with Red Hat servers

956
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:35,320
and I just did everything on Red Hat and then when Ubuntu started coming along with their

957
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:40,360
LTS releases I heavily advocated that for my clients because I really liked apt back

958
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:43,440
then I remember this is a long time ago and apt was a significant competitive advantage

959
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:50,600
in my opinion for managing a distribution and I was able to take by four or five years

960
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:58,000
of only using RHEL to Ubuntu because I understood what I was doing in RHEL and I could translate

961
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,080
that to essentially almost everything that was the same on Ubuntu with maybe a few things

962
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:06,040
in different places or a config file that's in a folder instead of directly in Etsy or

963
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:12,080
you know small differences and so it made the skill set that I learned on RHEL applicable

964
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:19,200
to other platforms which made me more employable and it was a net plus that way but I don't

965
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,760
feel like you would get that with yast so not only is it not appealing for people who

966
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:26,440
are used to managing their systems from the ground up like an arch user might be but I

967
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:31,240
think that people that want to participate professionally in the industry unless they're

968
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:35,900
in a niche that serves applications that run on SUSE servers which in that case this is

969
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:41,100
an obvious non-problem you kind of are limiting yourself because you're learning how to do

970
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:45,720
it the yast way and not the way that every other single distribution might be doing it

971
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:50,680
even if yast is just pulling those same levers for you under the hood and so I think it's

972
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:55,760
a bigger problem than just the power user perspective and I know this is going to sound

973
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:00,200
crazy to anybody who might be listening from the project because yast is kind of like their

974
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:05,520
you know competitive differentiator but from where I'm sitting at it feels like something

975
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:10,600
that when Linux needed everything set up for you when everything out of the box needed

976
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:15,800
to be configured like your X config file and all of your devices and your printers and

977
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:20,640
your USB scanners wouldn't just work or your SCSI devices like it made so much sense back

978
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:26,960
then but today outside of maybe managing things like boot managers and snapshots and stuff

979
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:34,000
like that I just feel like it's a brutal experience that really kind of turns me off the distribution

980
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,160
completely like I'm never going to want to be dependent on that tool I'm never going

981
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:42,840
to want to just isolate myself to one distribution and one way of doing things and I guess I

982
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:47,440
find it I find it really kind of disappointing that I couldn't get over that because I can

983
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:52,440
see how appealing it would be to people to have tumbleweed on your daily driver and leap

984
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:57,560
on your server and leap on your raspberry pies like I can really see the appeal of having

985
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:02,000
it all with one distro and one community and I really wish that could have worked for me

986
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:07,680
but at the end of the day it just doesn't I'm wondering did you have any fun or not

987
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:12,000
notice at all butter fs by the default you know didn't really get a chance to dig into

988
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
a great question I feel like that's another thing I need to spend a little more time with

989
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,000
so I'm going to keep it on the box I'm going to try to get the Nvidia card working I'm

990
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,560
sure I'll get some tips on how to do that and I want to try it on the Raspberry Pi 400

991
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:26,120
as well I think that's an important note we should add really just to be clear about in

992
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:32,160
this you know it's it's this is not an assessment of fact around hope ensues tumbleweed who

993
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:36,580
it does or doesn't work for anything like that really this is just us getting our toes

994
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:41,040
wet again in this ecosystem and yeah like you Chris I'm going to keep it around for

995
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:44,880
a while keep playing with it keep it on one of my machines and just see what it feels

996
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:51,480
like to live the lizard lifestyle for a bit live the lizard lifestyle I like it I want

997
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:56,960
to I want to make a kind of an important announcement moving on our unplugged core contributors

998
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:01,520
we had a bit of a snafu with the founders promo code a learning moment you could call

999
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:07,460
it that I think may have run afoul of a platform bug I'm not sure so I had to remove the founders

1000
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:14,220
promo today as we're recording however the platform support folks are at memberful are

1001
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:17,840
trying to see if they can figure out who was in the founders discount and just get it reapplied

1002
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:22,680
to you that may happen but if that doesn't happen if you notice like you got a price

1003
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:27,840
bump or you just want to get in and become a core contributor at the beginning of 2021

1004
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:31,760
and get the whole year in I have a new promo code that will take two dollars off the price

1005
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:37,800
I I'm never really doing this anymore because honestly you know it it's a big discount but

1006
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:41,880
with this oops and the founders promo code getting removed I wanted to make it right

1007
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:45,800
and so the new promo code that anyone is welcome to use if you want to get this locked in at

1008
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:52,360
the beginning of 2021 is just 2021 so if you go to unplugged core.com and you apply the

1009
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:58,040
promo code 2021 you'll get two dollars off the membership and that should remain on your

1010
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:02,540
account for the entire time you're a member I apologize for the snafu with the founders

1011
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:06,480
stuff I think I'm just gonna probably get to the bottom of it in the next couple of

1012
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:11,920
days I'm working actively with the memberful support who has been awesome and super responsive

1013
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:17,760
about the situation but it got kind of gnarly and this really sucks it resulted in like

1014
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:24,680
a lot of our OG core contributors not renewing by mistake so 52 percent of you have been

1015
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:31,840
accidentally unsubscribed it's just it really stinks so if you could double check on your

1016
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:36,320
membership and if you've been unsubscribed or it's not the right price you can put that

1017
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:40,960
promo code 2021 on there I think I'm gonna leave it open for a couple of weeks and you

1018
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:46,520
can support the show that's unplugged core.com and then you get access to a limited ad feed

1019
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:50,280
if you'd like the show with the same full production but just limited ads we make that

1020
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:54,640
available as a perk additionally we have a bootleg feed it's the full live stream all

1021
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:59,000
of our screw-ups all of our resets the stuff that never makes into the show with much larger

1022
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,880
pre and post show that's essentially a whole other show that's also available to you as

1023
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:09,040
a member and I mean two dollars off the membership price is pretty pretty great so unplugged

1024
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:14,520
core.com and my bad I'm actually not 100% sure it was my fault but I'm taking responsibility

1025
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:22,400
for it I'm making it right so use the promo code 2021 all right Westpain we have a really

1026
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:28,200
great pick this week and I believe you and I are both Todoist users for a little over

1027
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:34,480
a year so maybe you even longer yes we are and Todoist has released like an electron

1028
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:41,800
version of their to-do tracking application but you know me I like something local so

1029
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:46,920
if you want to keep track of your projects your tasks your goals in a local app that

1030
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:52,780
looks really really nice I do I do that sounds like you will then check out planner at use

1031
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:56,520
planner.com it's a it's an example of one of the beautiful apps that's been designed

1032
01:05:56,520 --> 01:06:00,860
for elementary OS that I mean because it's based on native local Linux technologies as

1033
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:06,120
impossible it's possible to get another distros I'm I'm running it on on a plasma box and

1034
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:09,520
if you're on arch you want you want the the version of the package that has elementary

1035
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:14,320
in the name it's elementary dash planner there's two planners in the arch repo or in the AUR

1036
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:18,520
you want elementary dash planner if you're on arch and the beautiful thing about it

1037
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:22,280
is if you just want something super simple local it can do that you don't need any integration

1038
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:26,720
with anything it'll just be a really nice local app it's a beautiful GTK app but it

1039
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:32,680
looks just fine on plasma too then if you are a todoist user you can connect it to your

1040
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:36,960
todoist account it will sync and import everything from todoist and then you don't have to use

1041
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:42,660
their electron app that I was pretty impressed with it just worked right away no problems

1042
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:48,560
had to you know log in like usual I like that now I installed the flat pack which there

1043
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:53,480
is a flat pack available which made it really easy also on a plasma desktop I've got some

1044
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:59,360
sort of strange black borders around mine but otherwise it seems to be working very

1045
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:04,480
nicely and I think I'm going to keep it you can go into the preferences and change some

1046
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:07,360
of the appearance options so you might want to play around with that you know like put

1047
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:12,000
it in dark mode ops and then the other thing you might want to check on is what your GTK

1048
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,120
theme settings are right now for plasma there might be something walka there because it

1049
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:23,320
is a GTK application but hot damn is it great and todoist is admittedly not free software

1050
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:28,960
um it's not an open source hosted solution but it has a lot of collaborative features

1051
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:33,880
it has integration with freaking everything it's got an API for days and so I just sort

1052
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:37,540
of eventually fell into using it because they have mobile apps they have web apps they now

1053
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:42,820
you know have third-party client apps and that's that I like a lot and over the years

1054
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:47,360
I've tried a lot of things but I keep coming back to todoist because of this kind of flexibility

1055
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:54,600
and the idea that I can have this nice well-designed todoist client that's native on my Linux desktop

1056
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:59,800
and then have a native app on my phone kind of puts it in the sweet spot for me so check

1057
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:05,100
that one out it's it's worth it it's totally worth it so we have a bunch of feedback this

1058
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:10,920
week mr. Westpain and it's hard to say if we could get to all of it but I did want to

1059
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:17,320
get to the tuxes feedback because we've heard a lot from that I'm I'm really I'm really

1060
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:22,040
happy that people seem to really enjoy the tuxes it's been really well received people

1061
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:27,080
who won the tuxes are are excited and I it was a nice it was a nice way to say thank

1062
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:31,040
you at the end of the year so Roy writes in regarding the award show he said you hope

1063
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:34,640
for more people to vote I think you should have mentioned the voting on other JB shows

1064
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:40,640
as well and I think he's absolutely right I I will attempt when my goal is for next

1065
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:47,720
year's tuxes is by around Thanksgiving to have a URL that is just you go to a URL directly

1066
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:53,560
that we maybe even launch a week earlier than we did this time around and that we do promote

1067
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:57,920
it on other shows and if you're out there and interested in maybe helping me build like

1068
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:07,240
a static website that we could use to also show who won because that was a request that

1069
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:13,040
came in by some of the tuxes winners was hey we'd sure like to be able to share something

1070
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:18,560
just to tell the team and that makes a lot of sense so a site that that could that could

1071
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:24,040
hold the winners for every year and then maybe you could click on it and get like their individual

1072
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:29,400
award page that says you know fedora project for this or or whatever who was a winner and

1073
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:34,280
then maybe even an embed of the YouTube video with the time code and just something that's

1074
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:41,080
easy simple fast that we could update every year with the tuxes I think would be great

1075
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:45,000
and so if somebody's out there that wants to help me with that get ahold of me you can

1076
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,420
use the contact form or you can email me directly Chris at you better broadcasting.com or probably

1077
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:54,360
telegram or whatever too I I don't know if that's a good idea but you can you can give

1078
01:09:54,360 --> 01:10:02,680
it a shot probably the show contact is the simplest for everyone yeah yeah so anyways

1079
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:07,760
that is feedback we are taking in and we'll try to get like a visual representation of

1080
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:12,620
that as well we also had a suggestion from Sandro about the tuxes you want to take that

1081
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:19,760
one with yeah Sandro wrote in and actually a lot of advice for us but thought that it

1082
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:24,160
might be overkill for the kind of contest we're doing but we could consider having a

1083
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:30,760
nomination phase first and then a voting phase you know sort of accept proposals for each

1084
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:37,000
category make a big list and then in the voting phase only allow entries from that list you

1085
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,800
know that might make some of the tallying a little bit simpler but wouldn't mean we

1086
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:45,520
need to get things started even earlier so like almost like a bracketing system where

1087
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:50,620
you kind of like have a phase one that we take the submissions and then we have a debate

1088
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:54,580
and discussion about that one and then move a subset of those to the final round yeah

1089
01:10:54,580 --> 01:10:59,440
exactly that's an interesting idea that I don't know how we would do that in a way that

1090
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:05,620
wouldn't drag it out forever though yes Sandro even linked to some some voting theory and

1091
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:09,440
some more technical resources that we can take a look at to see how we might actually

1092
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:14,360
implement such a system thank you everyone for bearing with with us on this you know

1093
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:18,480
I think it was a lot of fun and interesting but it was definitely a rough first year for

1094
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:21,500
the tuxes but I'm already looking forward to the next year and I think there's lots

1095
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:27,120
of stuff that we can do to improve it so if you do have further ideas suggestions tools

1096
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:31,720
things we just shouldn't try again please do let us know yeah it was definitely a minimum

1097
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:36,880
viable tuxes we weren't sure if the idea was sound we wanted to try it because it's something

1098
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:42,580
that we've kicked around for years and um I think it showed that it was worth investing

1099
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:46,720
more into and we're interested in doing that and it also could become a yearly tradition

1100
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:51,480
that we get to look forward to kind of like the predictions and reviews that as a team

1101
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:56,040
is kind of like it's it's almost the biggest indication that the holiday season is here

1102
01:11:56,040 --> 01:12:00,200
is that we start working on those shows so it has some sentimental value it's not like

1103
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:04,660
a milestone in the production year of the show like when we get to those shows we know

1104
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:09,880
we have done a solid year of shows by that point and it's it's kind of a moment so it's

1105
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:13,900
something we want to do and we would love to get your suggestions we'll take one last

1106
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:19,920
email that comes in from five on gnome 40s impending changes it says happy new year's

1107
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:25,080
I am a gnome user and gnome has a killer workflow for me that no other desktop offers without

1108
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:30,040
a ton of customization I use the auto hide top bar as my only extension to create a clean

1109
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:34,600
desktop I'm slightly nervous of the new changes proposed to my bread and butter activities

1110
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:40,400
overview which if you're not familiar listener there is some significant work going into

1111
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:45,040
how the overview section of gnome will work I'm sure the changes will be welcome but the

1112
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:49,880
activities overflow is what I use most to move quickly to other applications it's much

1113
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:55,240
quicker than sequential alt-tabbing and doesn't require crazy key combos or memorizations

1114
01:12:55,240 --> 01:13:00,980
I also like how I can easily manage my work and home workspace within the overview before

1115
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:06,000
the pandemic I did a magic trick and replaced Windows 10 with Ubuntu at work my co-worker

1116
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:10,340
quickly noticed how changing from Windows 10 the company standard to gnome desktop was

1117
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:13,900
really key for my workflow and productivity that's interesting find that you had other

1118
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:19,240
people's notice that as well yeah I think gnome users are sitting here a bit nervous

1119
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:23,140
at this point with gnome 40 looming out there it's one of the things we're watching for

1120
01:13:23,140 --> 01:13:27,700
it's sort of the upside and the downside right if you if you click with gnome and the workflow

1121
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:32,420
and the way it's set up it can be really really nice but because it is so specific it also

1122
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:36,820
means that any changes to it are going to be way more noticeable than say on plasma

1123
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:41,060
I want to believe that they've they've they've received and kind of internalized some of

1124
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:47,540
the feedback over the years and I think really since the gnome 310 311 and 312 series we've

1125
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:54,160
seen a a a more compromised approach to some of the design choices and some of the changes

1126
01:13:54,160 --> 01:14:00,640
and we've seen a real increase in performance and stability so it seems like the last the

1127
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:05,380
last solid bit of gnome history has shown us that the developers are working in the

1128
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:10,140
right direction and so it is possible that gnome 40 lands and people have a lot of strong

1129
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:15,140
feedback about it but so far history has showed us that over time they'll work some of that

1130
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:20,700
back they'll they'll modify some of it to meet user demand it may be jarring at first

1131
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:24,900
and as a as a project they have to figure out okay what are people freaking out about

1132
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:29,180
because change is hard and it's jarring and what are people freaking out about that is

1133
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:32,620
legitimate and we have to improve and they'll just have to have to sit with some of these

1134
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:38,380
changes for a bit to be able to pick pick out the signal from the noise and as a community

1135
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:42,300
I think we kind of have to give them some of that grace for a bit and we'll try it we'll

1136
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:45,740
be honest about what works and doesn't work but at the same time we're not getting the

1137
01:14:45,740 --> 01:14:51,380
pitchforks over it you know they'll refine the process we hope just have to wait and

1138
01:14:51,380 --> 01:14:57,580
see we'd love to have you join the show live we do it Tuesday at noon Pacific 3 p.m. Eastern

1139
01:14:57,580 --> 01:15:03,460
see you next week same bad time same bad station we'd love to have you join us because of course

1140
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:08,120
we got the chat room the mumble room just gives us that live vibe but we like that too

1141
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:14,340
but if you can't get the show live well then you're like 99.9% of the audience you can

1142
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:19,540
get it every single week by going to linuxunplugged.com subscribe with all the links there our contact

1144
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:28,900
are all at linuxunplugged.com thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the

1145
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:35,380
unplugged program also should mention we're at Linux unplugged on Twitter I never do that

1146
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:39,860
bad about that but you can get show announcements and stuff if Twitter's your thing either way

1147
01:15:39,860 --> 01:16:06,620
whatever you do we'll see you back here next Tuesday

1148
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:25,580
okay everybody go vote JBtitles.com one of the meta themes about this episode that Carl

1149
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:31,900
just started touch on before the show kicked off is how distributions sometimes do things

1150
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:38,060
differently you know can you have an Ubuntuism can you have a Seussism and there is different

1151
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:42,940
that's maybe a little more local and there's a different kind and Carl you were just starting

1152
01:16:42,940 --> 01:16:46,020
to touch on and I said wait wait wait save it for the post show do you want to pick that

1153
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:49,740
back up you remember what you were saying yeah I think the gist of it was is that every

1154
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:55,180
package in the distribution is sort of like a soft fork in a way unless it's just a direct

1155
01:16:55,180 --> 01:16:59,300
build of the upstream software exactly how they intended which a lot of them are close

1156
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:03,180
to that but you know there will be compile time options and other things like that but

1157
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:08,580
most distributions will diverge each package slightly with patch files and you know some

1158
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:13,420
of those are just to adapt it to the build system other ones are to fix other bugs or

1159
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:16,820
fix features maybe it's something that's already upstream that isn't in a release yet that

1160
01:17:16,820 --> 01:17:22,460
they just want to back port to them most recent release but the key thing is is that every

1161
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:29,100
patch that's applied it has a potential to cause problems a non-zero percentage chance

1162
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:34,300
and if a distribution is adding patches that the distribution came up with that aren't

1163
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:39,600
sent upstream if those patches cause problems it's up to that distribution by themselves

1164
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:44,460
to fix it they don't have any help but if a distribution practices what we call upstream

1165
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:50,460
first and they are working with the upstream developers that they don't they won't apply

1166
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:55,620
patches that aren't at least proposed upstream and that way if some one of those patches

1167
01:17:55,620 --> 01:18:00,760
does cause an issue that it's not just on the distro maintainers to fix fix those problems

1168
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:04,660
they'll actually be able to collaborate with the upstream developers right it's kind of

1169
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:09,860
where the upstream first mentality comes from i totally totally track and but at the same

1170
01:18:09,860 --> 01:18:14,940
time i have to do that well but thing you know couldn't i mean doesn't that seem like

1171
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:20,540
a little ideal scenario because you know for example this is a really small example but

1172
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:27,220
i could totally see this hitting an outfit like canonical for example you hire a developer

1173
01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:31,820
to make some changes to an open source project they create the code they package it all up

1174
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:35,780
and you submit it as a patch and then the upstream project says no we're not interested

1175
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:41,020
in going that direction no thanks and then you're like yeah but i have use cases or end

1176
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:47,540
users that do want this and you're kind of left well i can make the changes as open source

1177
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:52,600
software i have the ability to fix it for my users i mean isn't that kind of in a way

1178
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:57,080
what kind of drives some of this forking to begin with is just a difference in directions

1179
01:18:57,080 --> 01:19:02,020
for projects so people just have to do it themselves yeah absolutely i mean and that's

1180
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:07,260
the thing is whenever whenever a distribution is evaluating whether or not to apply the

1181
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:13,020
patch in the first place they need to weigh that risk so if there's a something proposed

1182
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:18,780
upstream that the distribution you know doesn't have any idea if it would be fixed or merged

1183
01:19:18,780 --> 01:19:22,900
then maybe that's not a good candidate to apply as a patch in the package yet but if

1184
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:26,900
it's something that you know the upstream has already said like yes this is an obvious

1185
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:32,220
fix we we you know thank you for the contribution we're we plan on merging this or we've already

1186
01:19:32,220 --> 01:19:36,020
merged it into the master branch and it'll be in the next release those are those those

1187
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:39,820
are the things that are a slam dunk to go ahead and add as a patch to the package because

1188
01:19:39,820 --> 01:19:45,020
you know that it's it's going to it's at least likely to be you know you'll be able to collaborate

1189
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:48,940
with the upstream developers on it so it's a risk evaluation whenever you're first applying

1190
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:52,540
that patch in the package yeah they got to do that math of like oh boy do we want to

1191
01:19:52,540 --> 01:19:57,140
take this on and be responsible for all the bugs and never really being accepted by by

1192
01:19:57,140 --> 01:20:02,260
the upstream yeah i i agree every patch has that risk and has to be evaluated it's complicated

1193
01:20:02,260 --> 01:20:07,020
you know assembling all these different pieces from all kinds of different people organizations

1194
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:11,020
and groups into what we view as one cohesive operating system
