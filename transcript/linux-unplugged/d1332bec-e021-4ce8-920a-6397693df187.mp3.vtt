00:00.000 --> 00:03.840
Talk about controversy, it looks like Ubuntu MATE 2204

00:03.840 --> 00:06.920
is gonna support Flatpak out of the box.

00:06.920 --> 00:11.240
Yeah, I guess this just means having Flatpak installed,

00:11.240 --> 00:14.000
no FlatHub or anything by default just yet.

00:14.000 --> 00:14.920
Oh, okay.

00:14.920 --> 00:17.240
I mean, it actually just feels like

00:17.240 --> 00:18.480
it just makes a lot of sense.

00:18.480 --> 00:20.120
Does make a lot of sense.

00:20.120 --> 00:22.440
It makes software easier to install.

00:22.440 --> 00:23.960
So if you have both snaps and Flatpaks,

00:23.960 --> 00:26.600
then you really can have anything on a system, right?

00:26.600 --> 00:28.680
But, I mean, let's be honest,

00:28.680 --> 00:32.560
it is notable that a major Ubuntu flavor is doing this.

00:32.560 --> 00:34.600
That actually does kind of seem like a big deal.

00:34.600 --> 00:36.040
Hopefully it's the first step

00:36.040 --> 00:38.680
to FlatHub being there someday.

00:38.680 --> 00:43.680
Oh, hey there and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

00:50.000 --> 00:50.840
My name is Chris.

00:50.840 --> 00:51.800
My name is Wes.

00:51.800 --> 00:53.000
And my name is Brent.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.960
Hello, gentlemen.

00:54.960 --> 00:56.600
Nice being here with you today.

00:56.600 --> 00:58.420
Coming up on the show,

00:58.420 --> 00:59.680
what's going on with Ubuntu?

00:59.680 --> 01:01.680
We're gonna run down the issues that we see.

01:01.680 --> 01:03.360
We've been dancing around this

01:03.360 --> 01:04.760
and taking different passes at it.

01:04.760 --> 01:07.440
But today we're gonna take it head on.

01:07.440 --> 01:10.160
Our thoughts on the new Ubuntu Pro integration

01:10.160 --> 01:12.160
that's been announced for 20204,

01:12.160 --> 01:13.840
where we think all of this could be going

01:13.840 --> 01:15.160
in the state of Ubuntu.

01:15.160 --> 01:17.760
And then we'll round out the show with some great feedback,

01:17.760 --> 01:20.980
some really great feedback, some pics and a lot more.

01:20.980 --> 01:22.740
There's a whole bunch of show today.

01:22.740 --> 01:24.480
So before we go any further,

01:24.480 --> 01:27.280
let's say time appropriate greetings to our virtual lug.

01:27.280 --> 01:28.420
Hello, Mumble Room.

01:28.420 --> 01:30.160
Hello. Hello.

01:30.160 --> 01:32.160
Hello, Chris. Hello, Wes.

01:32.160 --> 01:33.160
Hello, everybody.

01:33.160 --> 01:34.580
30 strong going today.

01:34.580 --> 01:37.360
Nice to have some up in the quiet listening.

01:37.360 --> 01:38.960
This is great joining us on a Sunday.

01:38.960 --> 01:40.660
Oh yeah, all wearing their uniforms,

01:40.660 --> 01:42.080
just like we asked them to.

01:42.080 --> 01:43.700
Well, it helps when you hand them out for free.

01:43.700 --> 01:44.540
That's right.

01:44.540 --> 01:45.880
You know, that does help.

01:45.880 --> 01:48.280
So before we get going, we gotta acknowledge

01:48.280 --> 01:51.380
there's just a little behind the scenes thing going on

01:51.380 --> 01:52.540
during the show today.

01:52.540 --> 01:53.920
And I just wanna get it out in the open

01:53.920 --> 01:55.920
in case something seems a little off.

01:55.920 --> 02:00.260
As we record, Brent is providing remote tech support,

02:00.260 --> 02:02.960
remote operational support for my wife,

02:02.960 --> 02:06.720
who is back at the RV right now, Lady Joups,

02:06.720 --> 02:08.220
affecting emergency repairs.

02:08.220 --> 02:09.060
How's it going on the ground, Brent?

02:09.060 --> 02:10.300
Brent is two-timing us?

02:10.300 --> 02:11.140
Yeah, yeah. What?

02:11.140 --> 02:12.440
I know, he's multitasking.

02:12.440 --> 02:15.640
I mean, I'm trying to just, you know, be the best me I can.

02:15.640 --> 02:19.280
What I'm getting is really photographs, Chris,

02:19.280 --> 02:23.020
of your RV wires that look like they've been chewed

02:23.020 --> 02:24.440
by a bunch of rats.

02:24.440 --> 02:26.240
Well, I don't know about a bunch, but it's bad.

02:26.240 --> 02:27.920
It's worse than bad.

02:27.920 --> 02:30.140
It's, oh my God, scary.

02:30.140 --> 02:31.640
We just came across something.

02:31.640 --> 02:32.480
All right, okay, all right.

02:32.480 --> 02:34.680
Stay a while and listen.

02:34.680 --> 02:37.780
It all comes back to when we got stuck out in the woods,

02:37.780 --> 02:38.880
when it got real cold,

02:38.880 --> 02:40.360
and we were snowed in for a week.

02:40.360 --> 02:41.240
You freeze out.

02:41.240 --> 02:44.280
So we brought Lady Joups back to a safe spot,

02:44.280 --> 02:45.640
and she was frozen solid.

02:45.640 --> 02:47.160
The tanks were all frozen.

02:47.160 --> 02:49.720
So we put in heaters, we took all the steps we could,

02:49.720 --> 02:51.200
and then we abandoned ship for a week,

02:51.200 --> 02:52.980
and we crashed at the studio.

02:52.980 --> 02:55.620
And while we were gone,

02:55.620 --> 02:58.420
and probably because it was so damn cold outside,

02:58.420 --> 03:00.300
a rat got inside the RV.

03:00.300 --> 03:02.760
I knew something was wrong,

03:02.760 --> 03:05.940
because I have motion sensors around Lady Joups,

03:05.940 --> 03:08.260
and a couple of nights in a row,

03:08.260 --> 03:09.460
my motion sensors went off.

03:09.460 --> 03:11.260
So it's either that or a new ghost.

03:11.260 --> 03:13.580
Yeah, could be totally, you know, I'm always looking.

03:13.580 --> 03:15.300
But the cameras never caught anything.

03:15.300 --> 03:16.940
Like, the cameras would snap on,

03:16.940 --> 03:18.460
and by the time the cameras initialized,

03:18.460 --> 03:20.680
which is like, you know, two, three seconds,

03:20.680 --> 03:23.260
whatever triggered the motion sensor was gone.

03:24.620 --> 03:28.420
Until one night, I looked at my phone in the morning,

03:28.420 --> 03:32.860
and I saw, unlike, I think, I guess it's the axle,

03:32.860 --> 03:37.820
I saw a big fat rat running along the axle of Lady Joups.

03:37.820 --> 03:41.380
And that's when I was like, oh no, right?

03:41.380 --> 03:42.700
Okay, we got a problem.

03:42.700 --> 03:45.060
So let's go pack up Lady Joups.

03:45.060 --> 03:46.120
Let's get out of here.

03:46.120 --> 03:46.960
There's rats.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.180
I mean, if your home can move,

03:48.180 --> 03:49.780
this is one of the times to move it.

03:49.780 --> 03:52.300
I don't want them, you know, doing any damage.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.140
So we get in there,

03:53.140 --> 03:54.540
and we were spending the whole day yesterday

03:54.540 --> 03:56.500
getting her packed up, doing all kinds of stuff.

03:56.500 --> 03:57.900
And of course, we had to run down to the studio

03:57.900 --> 03:59.460
and pick up some supplies that we had hired.

03:59.460 --> 04:00.300
Of course.

04:00.300 --> 04:01.380
So we're running down to the studio,

04:01.380 --> 04:03.860
not once, but twice to grab stuff,

04:03.860 --> 04:05.820
running back up to the RV.

04:05.820 --> 04:06.900
It's taken us all day.

04:06.900 --> 04:08.180
We've got kids running around.

04:08.180 --> 04:09.000
Their friends are coming over.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.940
All right, well, we packed up in another hour.

04:10.940 --> 04:11.780
Another hour.

04:11.780 --> 04:12.900
That's exactly the scenario.

04:12.900 --> 04:14.780
Like, okay, how much longer can I play?

04:14.780 --> 04:15.860
You got about an hour.

04:15.860 --> 04:17.160
And then two hours go by.

04:18.060 --> 04:19.460
So we get everything ready.

04:19.460 --> 04:20.740
The sun is setting.

04:20.740 --> 04:22.300
We're way later than we wanted to be,

04:22.300 --> 04:25.020
but we got to get out of there to protect lady tubes.

04:25.020 --> 04:26.460
And I go to check the tanks.

04:26.460 --> 04:27.300
Make sure we, you know,

04:27.300 --> 04:29.560
if we need to take any water on board

04:29.560 --> 04:31.180
or anything like that.

04:31.180 --> 04:32.540
And it has these little lights,

04:32.540 --> 04:33.860
these little LED lights that light up

04:33.860 --> 04:34.940
to indicate how full it is.

04:34.940 --> 04:37.080
And the light panel comes on for a moment,

04:37.080 --> 04:39.860
and then sort of blinks and fades out.

04:39.860 --> 04:40.700
Uh-oh.

04:40.700 --> 04:42.860
And then none of the buttons work.

04:42.860 --> 04:45.380
And I start going, oh, that's not good.

04:45.380 --> 04:48.680
But you know, she's like six, seven years old.

04:48.680 --> 04:49.520
These things happen.

04:49.520 --> 04:50.340
We were on rough roads.

04:50.340 --> 04:51.500
Maybe there's a wire loose.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.340
Yeah, sure.

04:52.340 --> 04:53.380
So we keep packing up.

04:53.380 --> 04:54.500
I bring in the living room slide.

04:54.500 --> 04:55.640
That was the slide that we were having problems

04:55.640 --> 04:56.480
that sent us to Tucson.

04:56.480 --> 04:57.560
I bring in the living room slide.

04:57.560 --> 04:59.000
I bring in the bedroom slide.

04:59.000 --> 04:59.940
We keep packing up.

04:59.940 --> 05:01.160
Kids are running around.

05:02.440 --> 05:05.400
I hit the button to bring in the kitchen slide,

05:05.400 --> 05:07.160
and nothing happens.

05:07.160 --> 05:08.640
No noise, no air lights.

05:08.640 --> 05:10.700
It's like I didn't even push the button.

05:10.700 --> 05:11.700
So I hit the extend,

05:11.700 --> 05:12.700
and I hear the motor spin up.

05:12.700 --> 05:14.120
Neat, and they start,

05:14.120 --> 05:14.960
but then there's nowhere to go

05:14.960 --> 05:16.300
because it's already extended.

05:16.300 --> 05:18.840
So then I push the retract button.

05:18.840 --> 05:19.680
Nothing.

05:21.580 --> 05:22.760
And I start doing the math,

05:22.760 --> 05:24.000
and I start thinking,

05:24.000 --> 05:26.920
okay, I saw a rat running on the axle.

05:26.920 --> 05:29.440
My LED lights just went out on my status indicators,

05:29.440 --> 05:31.080
and now this button doesn't work, right?

05:31.080 --> 05:32.880
I'm just adding it all up.

05:32.880 --> 05:35.000
And so from about 10 minutes after that point,

05:35.000 --> 05:38.080
we had a couple of the false floors in our cupboards removed

05:38.080 --> 05:40.440
where there's some different clusters of wiring.

05:40.440 --> 05:42.480
And we found, yeah, a rat got in there

05:42.480 --> 05:46.560
and chewed up the wiring that controls the slide.

05:46.560 --> 05:47.440
Of course.

05:48.400 --> 05:49.880
So I'm shutting down all the power.

05:49.880 --> 05:52.080
I'm shutting down my servers, my telcos.

05:52.080 --> 05:53.760
Everything's getting all shut down

05:53.760 --> 05:56.020
as we're re-patching up wiring.

05:57.160 --> 05:59.040
So that way we can try to get juice out of there.

05:59.040 --> 06:02.460
It has been like, really since Tucson,

06:02.460 --> 06:05.160
the environment, mother nature has been out to destroy us.

06:05.160 --> 06:06.360
That's really how it's been.

06:06.360 --> 06:07.560
Yeah, at this point, it's had to resort

06:07.560 --> 06:09.600
to sending little minions in to help out.

06:09.600 --> 06:10.880
That's next level.

06:10.880 --> 06:12.040
I'm at a point now

06:12.040 --> 06:13.960
where if anybody in the Pacific Northwest

06:13.960 --> 06:16.160
has a large garage with a large driveway

06:16.160 --> 06:19.160
that I could park juice in for about two, three weeks,

06:19.160 --> 06:22.840
so I can affect several different repairs now.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.920
Like I found this wiring

06:24.920 --> 06:26.680
and that wasn't the only wiring they chewed on.

06:26.680 --> 06:28.800
Like if we hadn't found this,

06:28.800 --> 06:30.420
we could have had some sort of disaster.

06:30.420 --> 06:32.160
You did check your brake lines, right?

06:32.160 --> 06:33.400
I gotta check everything.

06:33.400 --> 06:35.560
I gotta go, I gotta pull everything out

06:35.560 --> 06:37.760
and I gotta clean everything, which we have been doing.

06:37.760 --> 06:40.080
And I have to check everything.

06:40.080 --> 06:41.680
I gotta go through every single system.

06:41.680 --> 06:43.080
So I need a place that's dry

06:43.080 --> 06:44.720
because it's raining here all the time.

06:44.720 --> 06:46.040
Ideally rat-free.

06:46.040 --> 06:47.040
Yeah.

06:47.040 --> 06:49.440
Yeah, well that, let me tell you, we went to war, dude.

06:49.440 --> 06:50.320
I am not messing around.

06:50.320 --> 06:54.060
Peppermint, essential oils, noisemakers, traps,

06:54.060 --> 06:55.700
all kinds of stuff set up everywhere.

06:55.700 --> 06:57.500
More cameras deployed so I can see where,

06:57.500 --> 07:00.180
I mean, I don't mess around.

07:00.180 --> 07:03.480
I deploy everything within my power to get these things out.

07:03.480 --> 07:05.040
It's like a whole new game of tower defense

07:05.040 --> 07:05.880
you've got coming up.

07:05.880 --> 07:07.880
We even hired a professional to come out.

07:07.880 --> 07:09.360
Oh, wow.

07:09.360 --> 07:10.840
A local, who knows?

07:10.840 --> 07:12.480
So here's the problem.

07:12.480 --> 07:14.160
The whole damn town, the whole area,

07:14.160 --> 07:15.960
this whole block has rats.

07:15.960 --> 07:17.960
The whole block has rats.

07:17.960 --> 07:19.520
All the houses have rats.

07:19.520 --> 07:20.660
They're everywhere.

07:20.660 --> 07:22.100
So that's why we just gotta get out of there.

07:22.100 --> 07:24.240
It's like a infestation.

07:24.240 --> 07:25.920
I like how clever this rat was though.

07:25.920 --> 07:27.360
You know, like disabling the slide.

07:27.360 --> 07:29.360
That's one of the things that can really keep you there.

07:29.360 --> 07:30.560
It really was.

07:30.560 --> 07:32.660
It was a clever maneuver for sure.

07:32.660 --> 07:34.000
So while we're recording the show,

07:34.000 --> 07:37.280
she's back at home trying to repatch these wires together,

07:37.280 --> 07:39.320
cut out the bad spots that have been chewed up

07:39.320 --> 07:42.040
and then connect them back together.

07:42.040 --> 07:43.520
And we'll see.

07:43.520 --> 07:44.560
We'll see if we can get the slide in

07:44.560 --> 07:45.620
and get the hell out of there.

07:45.620 --> 07:47.080
But then I don't know where I'm going.

07:47.080 --> 07:49.120
I don't really have anywhere to go.

07:49.120 --> 07:50.300
So that's always fun.

07:50.300 --> 07:51.600
I mean, I can go back out into the woods,

07:51.600 --> 07:53.400
but how long is that gonna last?

07:53.400 --> 07:54.720
I don't know.

07:54.720 --> 07:55.760
So that's a good time.

07:55.760 --> 07:56.580
That's a good time.

07:56.580 --> 07:58.540
But hopefully Brent will have,

07:58.540 --> 08:00.500
Brent will still have availability for the show

08:00.500 --> 08:02.240
while everything gets patched up.

08:02.240 --> 08:03.060
Tell you what.

08:03.060 --> 08:03.900
I mean, how do you even,

08:03.900 --> 08:04.800
you can't even take it to somebody to work on it

08:04.800 --> 08:06.520
when you can't get the slides in.

08:06.520 --> 08:09.840
So as I sit here today,

08:09.840 --> 08:11.560
it has been basically like what,

08:11.560 --> 08:14.760
three or four or five months of mother nature on onslaught.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.080
It's just been crazy.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.040
I can't remember the last week that went by

08:18.040 --> 08:21.220
there wasn't like a pretty precarious joops update

08:21.220 --> 08:22.920
going on at one time or another.

08:25.320 --> 08:27.460
Although sure, you should learn a lot.

08:27.460 --> 08:30.160
Like we're learning like how the wiring works now

08:30.160 --> 08:31.000
on the slides more.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.380
So we figured out how to reverse the wiring.

08:33.380 --> 08:34.700
So that way, even the button,

08:34.700 --> 08:36.640
even when the button only works in one direction,

08:36.640 --> 08:38.440
we can reverse the wiring to change

08:38.440 --> 08:39.980
what that direction of the button does

08:39.980 --> 08:40.820
and that kind of stuff.

08:40.820 --> 08:43.040
And you can actually apply like a nine volt battery

08:43.040 --> 08:45.160
to one of the prongs and it'll activate the motors

08:45.160 --> 08:46.800
because it just needs a signal to tell it to turn on.

08:46.800 --> 08:47.840
Sure, right.

08:47.840 --> 08:49.580
That's all we need.

08:49.580 --> 08:51.660
You got to MacGyver a solution.

08:51.660 --> 08:53.560
At the end of this, you're going to be like customizing,

08:53.560 --> 08:55.100
building out your own rigs.

08:55.100 --> 08:57.840
It's sort of the perfect journey for a Linux user

08:57.840 --> 08:58.680
in that regard.

08:58.680 --> 09:00.920
It really, it does match up really well.

09:00.920 --> 09:03.080
It's just a pain in the butt.

09:03.080 --> 09:06.120
What you need is a, you don't have the hot standby RV

09:06.120 --> 09:08.520
that you can just jump through when you're experiment RV.

09:08.520 --> 09:11.120
Or just live somewhere where it's dry for a bit,

09:11.120 --> 09:12.240
where you can have like,

09:12.240 --> 09:14.240
where you can pull everything out of the rig

09:14.240 --> 09:15.080
and work on it.

09:15.080 --> 09:15.900
Like we've been thinking like,

09:15.900 --> 09:18.180
should we try to escape to Arizona or,

09:18.180 --> 09:19.020
Right.

09:19.020 --> 09:19.840
You know, somewhere where.

09:19.840 --> 09:20.680
Or trade.

09:20.680 --> 09:22.520
Yeah, but that's a whole, that's a whole, you know,

09:22.520 --> 09:23.360
financial thing.

09:23.360 --> 09:24.180
It's a whole trip to plan.

09:24.180 --> 09:25.500
And operational thing, yeah.

09:25.500 --> 09:27.140
We'll figure it out.

09:27.140 --> 09:29.840
We're not, you know, we're not done yet.

09:29.840 --> 09:31.480
We still have a little fight left in us.

09:31.480 --> 09:35.600
And I wonder if that's also true for Ubuntu.

09:35.600 --> 09:36.640
I want to talk about this

09:36.640 --> 09:38.240
because it's something that we've been,

09:38.240 --> 09:39.520
it's one of these things we've been having

09:39.520 --> 09:42.800
a really kind of frank conversation off-mic about.

09:42.800 --> 09:46.120
And we've touched on it in bits in the show.

09:46.120 --> 09:47.040
But we had to sit down

09:47.040 --> 09:49.060
and we really kind of put it all together

09:49.060 --> 09:51.920
and realized there's a lot going on with Ubuntu.

09:51.920 --> 09:54.680
And this announcement of the Ubuntu Pro,

09:54.680 --> 09:56.240
it's now going to be baked into the desktop.

09:56.240 --> 09:57.880
So in 2204, when you boot up,

09:57.880 --> 09:58.720
it's going to ask you

09:58.720 --> 10:00.800
if you'd like to subscribe to Ubuntu Pro.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.440
And that started just sort of really,

10:03.440 --> 10:06.180
I think solidifying our thoughts on this topic.

10:06.180 --> 10:10.200
Yeah, and well, rather unfortunately,

10:10.200 --> 10:13.360
when this new Ubuntu Pro integration first rolled out,

10:13.360 --> 10:15.120
at least in the dailies,

10:15.120 --> 10:17.640
it contained a rather annoying bug.

10:17.640 --> 10:19.320
So like at first it's designed,

10:19.320 --> 10:20.280
it's intended that like, you know,

10:20.280 --> 10:21.600
when you're first booting up here,

10:21.600 --> 10:23.600
you're first upgraded and you get this,

10:23.600 --> 10:24.640
you just got a little notification.

10:24.640 --> 10:27.920
Hey, do you want to try out this new Ubuntu Pro integration?

10:27.920 --> 10:29.920
Now that notification box asks,

10:29.920 --> 10:31.880
like, no, you know, if you decline.

10:31.880 --> 10:32.720
Yeah, don't remind me.

10:32.720 --> 10:35.640
Don't remind me, I'm cool, okay.

10:35.640 --> 10:37.320
Yeah, that part didn't work.

10:37.320 --> 10:40.000
Yeah, you click it, but it just didn't register.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.960
Now, in fact, it made sure it was going to appear next time.

10:43.960 --> 10:46.040
So every time you boot,

10:46.040 --> 10:48.080
even when you'd say, don't remind me,

10:48.080 --> 10:48.900
you'd get this prompt.

10:48.900 --> 10:50.080
Now, to be totally clear,

10:50.080 --> 10:52.080
these are in the daily images for a beta

10:52.080 --> 10:54.520
that just a tiny, tiny amount of people are using,

10:54.520 --> 10:56.400
but it's not like a great first impression.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.840
No, and it's definitely going to make you ask

10:58.840 --> 11:00.800
because you're going to see it a bunch.

11:00.800 --> 11:03.360
What is Ubuntu Pro?

11:03.360 --> 11:05.080
And I'm not quite sure,

11:05.080 --> 11:07.480
because it seems like maybe it's not all done yet,

11:07.480 --> 11:10.200
but I think essentially it's a rebrand

11:10.200 --> 11:14.000
of the Ubuntu Advantage service, which reminded me,

11:14.000 --> 11:15.680
weren't you using that on a few of the machines?

11:15.680 --> 11:17.000
Yeah, these machines,

11:17.000 --> 11:19.840
these three machines here on the studio desk

11:19.840 --> 11:23.000
are all signed up with Ubuntu Advantage for years now,

11:23.000 --> 11:25.400
since like 2018, when we first deployed them.

11:25.400 --> 11:29.880
I signed up, it gives you additional patch support,

11:29.880 --> 11:32.760
so there's like an additional 30 packages they're patching.

11:32.760 --> 11:35.000
It gives you live kernel updates,

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
and it gives you a central place,

11:37.000 --> 11:39.360
at least Ubuntu Advantage does,

11:39.360 --> 11:41.800
where you can see your machines, see their version,

11:41.800 --> 11:43.960
you get just some basic overall

11:43.960 --> 11:45.960
high level information about them,

11:45.960 --> 11:48.840
which is nice when you're managing multiple machines.

11:48.840 --> 11:50.640
I did pay for it initially,

11:50.640 --> 11:52.200
but then they made a modification

11:52.200 --> 11:53.760
where up to three machines is free,

11:53.760 --> 11:56.560
and it seems like that's gonna be true for Ubuntu Pro as well.

11:56.560 --> 11:57.720
Hey, that's nice.

11:57.720 --> 11:59.680
Yeah, it does look like they're in transition

11:59.680 --> 12:01.160
from Advantage to Pro.

12:01.160 --> 12:03.720
I'm not sure, I think Ubuntu Pro is probably a better name.

12:03.720 --> 12:05.440
It is, yeah, I noticed in the code base,

12:05.440 --> 12:07.400
it's still called Ubuntu Advantage and stuff,

12:07.400 --> 12:08.840
but you know, these things take time.

12:08.840 --> 12:11.240
Yeah, did either one of you guys try it out?

12:11.240 --> 12:14.080
I know we all loaded up the beta recently to give this a go.

12:14.080 --> 12:16.280
Yeah, I did, I mean, I don't know how much

12:16.280 --> 12:18.200
I really need it in my day to day.

12:18.200 --> 12:20.280
I do think like the live patch functionality,

12:20.280 --> 12:21.840
that stuff still fascinates me.

12:21.840 --> 12:23.720
I love that that's even a thing that we can do,

12:23.720 --> 12:25.520
and that it works, and that, you know, like,

12:25.520 --> 12:27.720
but at least on most of my Ubuntu machines,

12:27.720 --> 12:28.560
I don't need that.

12:28.560 --> 12:29.960
I also don't need like a bunch of the stuff

12:29.960 --> 12:32.120
they have in here for compliance and hardening,

12:32.120 --> 12:33.520
but that does seem pretty handy

12:33.520 --> 12:36.120
if you're gonna roll this out for like enterprise desktops.

12:36.120 --> 12:38.120
Yeah, Brad, did you get a chance to try it?

12:38.120 --> 12:41.280
You know, I actually didn't because I wasn't,

12:41.280 --> 12:42.640
I don't know, nothing really stood out to me,

12:42.640 --> 12:44.160
like, hey, yeah, this sounds really interesting,

12:44.160 --> 12:45.600
I'm gonna go try this out.

12:45.600 --> 12:48.480
And I think it's interesting to me,

12:48.480 --> 12:49.960
maybe it frames this whole conversation,

12:49.960 --> 12:54.320
is that we're putting attention on a little indicator.

12:54.320 --> 12:56.240
And I remember a few years ago

12:56.240 --> 12:57.880
when there were so many new features

12:57.880 --> 13:02.360
on every release of Ubuntu that were like super exciting,

13:02.360 --> 13:05.000
and I couldn't even help myself but to jump in

13:05.000 --> 13:07.240
and try things even before they were released.

13:07.240 --> 13:10.200
And there's something about recent times

13:10.200 --> 13:12.680
that I think is worrisome maybe in that way.

13:12.680 --> 13:13.800
Yeah, I see where you're going.

13:13.800 --> 13:16.400
And I think that's why we wanted to talk about this too.

13:16.400 --> 13:18.120
And, you know, I don't necessarily think

13:18.120 --> 13:19.440
this service is a bad idea.

13:19.440 --> 13:21.080
We've recently been talking about ways

13:21.080 --> 13:23.560
to monetize desktop Linux development.

13:23.560 --> 13:26.160
Maybe this is one of those solutions.

13:26.160 --> 13:27.560
That is one of the things I think

13:27.560 --> 13:29.200
that stands out about this as well,

13:29.200 --> 13:31.080
seeing this get a little more focus attention,

13:31.080 --> 13:32.760
a little more draw prompt, you know,

13:32.760 --> 13:35.160
maybe this is an area that Canonical's planning to push on.

13:35.160 --> 13:36.880
Yeah, yeah.

13:36.880 --> 13:38.680
But I don't think it's gonna work.

13:38.680 --> 13:42.560
And I think what Brent was just touching on is part of it.

13:42.560 --> 13:45.320
If you look at, so you're kind of pushing this

13:45.320 --> 13:47.320
to anybody who gets Ubuntu now.

13:47.320 --> 13:51.160
And most people are gonna deploy it,

13:51.160 --> 13:54.520
in a lot of cases, in a VM for development testing.

13:54.520 --> 13:55.960
Or you have a lot of casual users

13:55.960 --> 13:58.000
who don't really need live patching service

13:58.000 --> 13:59.440
or the compliance stuff.

13:59.440 --> 14:01.240
They're not gonna apply their updates anyway.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.080
Yeah, yeah.

14:03.080 --> 14:06.000
But I actually think there's larger macro problems

14:06.000 --> 14:09.080
that Canonical faces that are gonna prevent this thing

14:09.080 --> 14:11.320
from really being successful.

14:11.320 --> 14:14.080
I mean, beyond just getting a high number of users,

14:14.080 --> 14:15.480
I mean, that may be a thing that they're going for

14:15.480 --> 14:17.480
is maybe they just want number big.

14:17.480 --> 14:21.280
But I don't think it's gonna be a very successful initiative

14:21.280 --> 14:24.880
because I think, and I don't get any joy in saying this,

14:24.880 --> 14:27.280
the Ubuntu desktop seems like it's in a decline.

14:28.440 --> 14:32.160
If you think about it, if you go back to April of 2017,

14:33.560 --> 14:37.440
Ubuntu had an amazing level of support from the community

14:37.440 --> 14:39.800
when they announced they were switching back to GNOME.

14:39.800 --> 14:40.840
I mean, yeah, some of us were like,

14:40.840 --> 14:42.320
oh, I wish it was Plasma.

14:42.320 --> 14:47.320
But this was 2017 and almost anything Canonical does

14:47.800 --> 14:49.760
is not well received by the community.

14:49.760 --> 14:50.920
But this one was.

14:50.920 --> 14:53.840
Yeah, and it was like, just thinking back to that era,

14:53.840 --> 14:55.760
you know, like when 16.04 had come out,

14:55.760 --> 14:57.240
there'd been changes over to system D,

14:57.240 --> 14:59.560
there'd been experimental ZFS support release.

14:59.560 --> 15:01.640
Like it was just, there were changes happening.

15:01.640 --> 15:02.840
It was a time to pay attention.

15:02.840 --> 15:05.440
Yeah, they really had captured everyone's attention

15:05.440 --> 15:06.280
at that time.

15:06.280 --> 15:11.280
It was a big, big batch of momentum to lose.

15:11.280 --> 15:13.800
And they've kind of been slowly losing it over time.

15:13.800 --> 15:16.320
And I think it all started with Snaps

15:16.320 --> 15:17.200
in this most recent round.

15:17.200 --> 15:19.120
I mean, there's been a lot of things in Canonical's history.

15:19.120 --> 15:21.120
We could go through all of them.

15:21.120 --> 15:26.120
But I really think Snaps created this weird dynamic

15:26.000 --> 15:28.400
between Canonical and the Linux community.

15:28.400 --> 15:29.960
And some commercial vendors love it, right?

15:29.960 --> 15:32.240
But the average Linux community

15:32.240 --> 15:34.800
just didn't really take to it.

15:34.800 --> 15:38.480
And the uptake for Snaps has been really kind of a grind

15:38.480 --> 15:39.680
for Canonical.

15:39.680 --> 15:41.560
And I think there's been resentment that's built up.

15:41.560 --> 15:44.680
The community resents Canonical for creating Snaps.

15:44.680 --> 15:47.600
And Canonical resents the community for pushing back on,

15:47.600 --> 15:49.880
well, just about anything they've ever done,

15:49.880 --> 15:51.000
including Snaps.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.320
Fair enough.

15:52.320 --> 15:56.000
And I think that exasperation inside Canonical

15:56.000 --> 15:57.880
has built up over the years.

15:57.880 --> 15:59.520
And it led to focus drifting

15:59.520 --> 16:02.880
and focusing on other areas like server and cloud.

16:02.880 --> 16:05.680
And over this time, some of our good friends

16:05.680 --> 16:08.160
that we all know have left Canonical.

16:08.160 --> 16:11.280
And that passion drain has a real impact on a company,

16:11.280 --> 16:13.080
even if they don't want to admit it.

16:13.080 --> 16:16.000
It does, even one or two people leaving like that

16:16.000 --> 16:17.720
can change a company.

16:17.720 --> 16:19.240
But it's a real problem for Canonical

16:19.240 --> 16:22.400
because they make money from the desktop.

16:22.400 --> 16:24.560
Yeah, sure, they make money from the other stuff.

16:24.560 --> 16:27.200
But they make money from those OEM deals

16:27.200 --> 16:29.560
with Dell and HP and others.

16:29.560 --> 16:32.760
And also, having a strong desktop offering

16:32.760 --> 16:37.440
is critical in an overall healthy developer ecosystem.

16:37.440 --> 16:39.920
You gotta have a desktop for people that are building

16:39.920 --> 16:41.840
these apps that are gonna run on Ubuntu.

16:41.840 --> 16:43.720
There's also, maybe it raises a question

16:43.720 --> 16:47.160
for the wider community, as Ubuntu just ends up,

16:47.160 --> 16:49.080
even among some of my friends

16:49.080 --> 16:50.760
who are kind of casual Linux users

16:50.760 --> 16:53.800
who could set up Arch, they know enough to do that.

16:53.800 --> 16:55.080
A lot of them just run Ubuntu

16:55.080 --> 16:58.040
because it's still got that default mentality.

16:58.040 --> 16:59.720
Is that just gonna get a little,

16:59.720 --> 17:01.120
maybe embarrassing is not the right word,

17:01.120 --> 17:02.440
but you could imagine a situation

17:02.440 --> 17:05.960
where if that really continues to see a lack of focus

17:05.960 --> 17:08.960
or polish and just be ashamed to have to either point people

17:08.960 --> 17:12.360
to other options or sort of have some apologetics

17:12.360 --> 17:15.160
and be like, yeah, I mean, that's not really representative

17:15.160 --> 17:16.720
of the best of the Linux desktop.

17:16.720 --> 17:17.920
Well, I think you're starting to see

17:17.920 --> 17:19.680
these red flags already.

17:19.680 --> 17:22.040
And I think Canonical sees these red flags.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.720
I don't think they're blind to these.

17:23.720 --> 17:26.160
The download numbers for the interim releases

17:26.160 --> 17:28.640
sound like they've been lower than typical.

17:28.640 --> 17:31.240
A huge red flag was when Valve announced

17:31.240 --> 17:34.160
the Steam Deck was switching to an Arch base

17:34.160 --> 17:37.560
because that implies behind the scenes,

17:37.560 --> 17:41.280
Valve developers spend hours and hours

17:41.280 --> 17:44.160
moving from a Debian base to an Arch base,

17:44.160 --> 17:46.080
which means that they did the math,

17:46.080 --> 17:47.480
they did the calculation and said,

17:47.480 --> 17:51.160
this is absolutely critical to the success of the device.

17:51.160 --> 17:53.040
We have to allocate time to this.

17:53.040 --> 17:54.440
Canonical saw that.

17:54.440 --> 17:57.000
You know, that's a massive, massive thing.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.360
Recent Linux YouTuber challenges.

17:59.360 --> 18:02.840
They launch, they have their community submit

18:02.840 --> 18:04.920
distros they should try.

18:04.920 --> 18:07.120
And Ubuntu was never even considered.

18:07.120 --> 18:12.120
Manjaro, Gentoo, Pop OS, Mint,

18:12.200 --> 18:13.960
no one suggested Ubuntu.

18:13.960 --> 18:16.400
I mean, you know, kind of an elephant in the room

18:16.400 --> 18:17.640
when that happens.

18:17.640 --> 18:19.000
And when you look at our Tuxies results

18:19.000 --> 18:20.920
that we did recently,

18:20.920 --> 18:23.600
Ubuntu clearly struggled in all of the results

18:23.600 --> 18:25.520
where it was one of the contenders.

18:25.520 --> 18:28.760
And the reality is, is that where enthusiasts tend to go,

18:28.760 --> 18:30.600
then that starts to be what people recommend,

18:30.600 --> 18:31.840
like you were just kind of inferring.

18:31.840 --> 18:35.160
And so now that the enthusiasts are using other distros,

18:35.160 --> 18:36.360
when new people are coming and saying,

18:36.360 --> 18:37.640
what distro should I use?

18:38.760 --> 18:41.840
The answer isn't Ubuntu for a lot of people anymore.

18:41.840 --> 18:42.920
No, not really.

18:42.920 --> 18:44.400
But I think the good news in all of this

18:44.400 --> 18:48.160
is that Canonical seems to have noticed, right?

18:48.160 --> 18:51.080
Like you can look at their actions and they seem to care

18:51.080 --> 18:52.920
because actions are gonna speak a lot louder

18:52.920 --> 18:54.560
than words in this case.

18:54.560 --> 18:56.640
And like they're hiring that Linux desktop

18:56.640 --> 18:58.200
gaming product manager.

18:58.200 --> 19:00.760
So is that maybe a start in the mobile room?

19:00.760 --> 19:03.040
Diddle Danny points out that maybe one way to look at this

19:03.040 --> 19:04.360
as people have left,

19:04.360 --> 19:07.680
but to what extent have those folks been replaced?

19:07.680 --> 19:08.520
Yeah.

19:08.520 --> 19:10.640
Diddle, do you think it's like a transition period?

19:10.640 --> 19:12.600
Not sure about that.

19:12.600 --> 19:17.600
A lot of the big folks in SnapCraft that have left,

19:17.600 --> 19:20.040
they just have not been replaced at all.

19:20.040 --> 19:21.160
That's interesting.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.560
But they have been hiring in like documentation.

19:23.560 --> 19:26.480
They have been hiring in the desktop space.

19:26.480 --> 19:27.880
What do you think that implies?

19:27.880 --> 19:30.440
I wonder if it's some kind of downgrading

19:30.440 --> 19:32.560
of the importance of snaps.

19:32.560 --> 19:34.160
Minimac, what are your thoughts?

19:34.160 --> 19:35.920
Well, I think it's not really an issue.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.520
Ubuntu has become standard

19:37.520 --> 19:40.840
and standard is not interesting for us Linux geeks,

19:40.840 --> 19:42.680
but still you can do everything you want.

19:42.680 --> 19:45.560
And Ubuntu, they have some license agreements

19:45.560 --> 19:48.800
with computer manufacturers like Lenovo and HP.

19:48.800 --> 19:51.240
They have thousands of installations running

19:51.240 --> 19:53.680
on universities and colleges.

19:53.680 --> 19:55.280
It's just a standard.

19:55.280 --> 19:57.440
And I don't think this is really a problem.

19:57.440 --> 19:59.240
You can do everything with Ubuntu.

19:59.240 --> 20:02.160
I use it until it's started.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.120
So I don't really see an issue.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.720
Brent, do you think we are just

20:05.720 --> 20:07.320
in the red flag stage right now?

20:07.320 --> 20:08.840
Like this is fixable, right?

20:08.840 --> 20:11.560
You know, I started with the red flag situation,

20:11.560 --> 20:13.520
but I think with Minimac,

20:13.520 --> 20:16.640
I just perhaps might suggest a different perspective.

20:16.640 --> 20:20.000
And I wonder, is this just a maturing

20:20.000 --> 20:22.200
of Linux distributions?

20:22.200 --> 20:25.320
You know, is Ubuntu the new Debian?

20:25.320 --> 20:27.440
You know, Debian used to be the kind of boring,

20:27.440 --> 20:29.800
really stable, you can install it

20:29.800 --> 20:32.360
and it would just work for a long time kind of distribution.

20:32.360 --> 20:36.880
And I wonder if Ubuntu sort of is the modern Debian

20:36.880 --> 20:39.280
in that sense, is it just finding a different kind

20:39.280 --> 20:40.120
of title?

20:41.320 --> 20:42.440
I could be totally wrong there.

20:42.440 --> 20:43.680
I'm curious what you think.

20:43.680 --> 20:48.480
I wonder, I feel that if you want to set the standard,

20:48.480 --> 20:51.040
if you wanna create something that developers

20:51.040 --> 20:53.480
are going to embrace and get excited about,

20:53.480 --> 20:55.120
if you want buzz, that kind of stuff,

20:55.120 --> 20:58.360
you can't let your foot off the gas too much.

20:58.360 --> 20:59.800
Otherwise, before you know it,

20:59.800 --> 21:01.440
the whole world's talking about Fedora,

21:01.440 --> 21:03.000
Pop!OS and Manjaro.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.200
Altera, I know I always butcher your handle,

21:05.200 --> 21:06.760
but you have some perspective too.

21:06.760 --> 21:08.840
Well, Ubuntu is like a great product

21:08.840 --> 21:11.720
and like a nice operating system.

21:11.720 --> 21:14.800
But like for the past couple of years,

21:14.800 --> 21:17.600
they fired a lot of people and dropped Unity 8,

21:17.600 --> 21:22.320
which was like most of their desktop projects at the time.

21:22.320 --> 21:25.400
Because up till then, they were like heavily involved

21:25.400 --> 21:28.320
in like creating things in Ubuntu

21:28.320 --> 21:30.960
that were then like trickled out

21:30.960 --> 21:33.960
or get adopted by the upstream projects.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.400
But when they fired a lot of people

21:36.400 --> 21:39.320
and just dropped their main desktop projects,

21:39.320 --> 21:41.160
the rest of the desktop team that was left

21:41.160 --> 21:44.200
was like playing catch-ups and reacting

21:44.200 --> 21:47.560
to what the rest of the ecosystem is doing.

21:47.560 --> 21:49.840
And they like do not have the research now

21:49.840 --> 21:52.800
to develop new desktop things

21:52.800 --> 21:55.120
because the server seems to be like

21:55.120 --> 21:56.960
the only funded space now.

21:56.960 --> 21:58.520
It does make me think of, you know,

21:58.520 --> 22:00.000
us sort of wondering like, well,

22:00.000 --> 22:02.160
are they going to catch up on the latest GNOME stuff?

22:02.160 --> 22:04.800
Yeah, I think what I'm searching for

22:04.800 --> 22:08.400
is I want to want to run Ubuntu.

22:08.400 --> 22:09.520
I want to want to run it.

22:09.520 --> 22:11.760
Like, and I don't.

22:11.760 --> 22:13.800
I, it's just not even really a consideration

22:13.800 --> 22:17.560
when I'm reloading, when I was taking Mint off my ThinkPad,

22:17.560 --> 22:18.800
I thought about Arch for a minute

22:18.800 --> 22:20.040
and I just said, I'm going to stick with Fedora.

22:20.040 --> 22:20.880
And I went back to Fedora.

22:20.880 --> 22:21.840
I think it is especially hard

22:21.840 --> 22:23.400
with how good Fedora has gotten.

22:23.400 --> 22:25.240
And now that that's, I can see it, you know,

22:25.240 --> 22:26.080
if you've always used Ubuntu

22:26.080 --> 22:27.000
and you haven't played with Fedora,

22:27.000 --> 22:29.080
but like, if you know how to make Fedora work well,

22:29.080 --> 22:31.560
which does not take very much these days.

22:31.560 --> 22:33.320
And it's, there's just so much more to be excited

22:33.320 --> 22:35.760
about every release and you get more releases more often.

22:35.760 --> 22:36.720
It's tricky, right?

22:36.720 --> 22:38.480
Because what Fedora has done

22:38.480 --> 22:42.040
is they've shipped the right upstream first,

22:42.040 --> 22:44.680
and then they have put together a really good system

22:44.680 --> 22:47.600
to manage all of it in a really clean modern design

22:47.600 --> 22:49.280
for a Linux system.

22:49.280 --> 22:52.320
And they, you know, Canonical's approach

22:52.320 --> 22:54.240
is much more direct.

22:54.240 --> 22:57.720
It's about creating that Ubuntu desktop experience.

22:57.720 --> 23:00.480
And they think about things like snaps and that,

23:00.480 --> 23:03.880
and it's just a different, it's a different set of goals.

23:03.880 --> 23:06.960
And the problem is, is that I think it's just more noticeable

23:06.960 --> 23:09.200
when they take their foot off the gas.

23:09.200 --> 23:12.320
And I don't know, I'm looking forward to 2204,

23:12.320 --> 23:15.320
you know, and with this bug fix for this Ubuntu pro thing,

23:15.320 --> 23:16.840
where you can say, don't remind me,

23:16.840 --> 23:18.600
and then it doesn't bother you anymore.

23:18.600 --> 23:20.080
That's a nice solution.

23:20.080 --> 23:21.120
And you can still enable it.

23:21.120 --> 23:22.160
If you say, don't remind me,

23:22.160 --> 23:23.280
and then decide to change your mind,

23:23.280 --> 23:26.240
you can go into the software and sources app,

23:26.240 --> 23:27.360
and still turn it back on.

23:27.360 --> 23:28.400
It's available in there.

23:28.400 --> 23:30.160
You know, the recent news

23:30.160 --> 23:32.440
around System76's scheduler stuff,

23:32.440 --> 23:35.320
I think that also maybe because System76 has been,

23:35.320 --> 23:37.480
you know, has been stepping up their focus

23:37.480 --> 23:40.280
on their own desktop efforts and are not distracted,

23:40.280 --> 23:41.520
well, distracted's a strong word here,

23:41.520 --> 23:43.160
but you know, do not have a server side

23:43.160 --> 23:45.720
to really dive into.

23:45.720 --> 23:48.920
That also makes, I think adds a contrast.

23:48.920 --> 23:49.920
That's such a great point

23:49.920 --> 23:53.080
because that is definitely putting pressure on this

23:53.080 --> 23:55.120
because, you know, you can disagree

23:55.120 --> 23:56.920
with the direction they're taking Cosmic,

23:56.920 --> 23:59.200
but it's- They're doing something.

23:59.200 --> 24:00.720
Yeah, it's a bold pushing forward,

24:00.720 --> 24:01.560
especially with the scheduler too.

24:01.560 --> 24:02.400
And you see that too,

24:02.400 --> 24:03.840
like I think Manjaro's really good about it.

24:03.840 --> 24:06.160
They have a very good, strong brand there.

24:06.160 --> 24:08.480
Fedora, again, Fedora I think does a great job

24:08.480 --> 24:09.880
of having a very strong experience

24:09.880 --> 24:11.520
and not having to really make something

24:11.520 --> 24:12.880
that deviates very much from upstream.

24:12.880 --> 24:14.960
Like these, they all have a spot there

24:14.960 --> 24:17.080
and where Ubuntu's carved out for themselves,

24:17.080 --> 24:20.240
it just, you can really feel it when they let off.

24:20.240 --> 24:23.120
But I am heartened, I guess, by seeing like signs

24:23.120 --> 24:25.520
that they seem to recognize it to some degree

24:25.520 --> 24:27.320
and they want to address it.

24:27.320 --> 24:30.360
I want to believe that after the Steam Deck was announced,

24:30.360 --> 24:32.920
they had a conversation internal that said,

24:32.920 --> 24:34.440
so why didn't they go with Ubuntu?

24:34.440 --> 24:36.280
Why didn't they use Ubuntu Core on this thing?

24:36.280 --> 24:37.120
I hope so.

24:37.120 --> 24:38.760
Wouldn't that, I mean, isn't that the canonical dream?

24:38.760 --> 24:41.800
Like a device like the Deck using Ubuntu Core,

24:41.800 --> 24:44.040
shipping everything as a snap,

24:44.040 --> 24:46.760
updating Steam as a snap, all of that.

24:46.760 --> 24:48.000
Doesn't it seem perfect?

24:48.000 --> 24:50.160
Yeah, I thought maybe that would work really well.

24:50.160 --> 24:52.680
Yeah, and that's not what they're doing at all.

24:52.680 --> 24:54.000
They're going with Arch.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.280
They're doing it all themselves, their own repos.

24:56.280 --> 24:57.800
They went the most 180.

24:57.800 --> 24:58.800
Arch and Plasma, right?

24:58.800 --> 25:00.400
Yeah, yeah.

25:00.400 --> 25:01.360
So what's that about?

25:01.360 --> 25:02.920
I hope they had a conversation around that.

25:02.920 --> 25:05.440
But I'd like to know your thoughts out there.

25:05.440 --> 25:06.480
Maybe you haven't noticed this.

25:06.480 --> 25:08.120
Maybe you like the change.

25:08.120 --> 25:10.820
Maybe you've noticed a transition, but you like it.

25:10.820 --> 25:14.240
Let us know, linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

25:14.240 --> 25:18.000
Linode.com slash unplugged.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.680
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account,

25:21.680 --> 25:23.640
and you go there to support this here show.

25:23.640 --> 25:25.120
Linode's how we've built everything

25:25.120 --> 25:26.480
since we've gone independent.

25:26.480 --> 25:28.720
I really feel like it's my secret weapon,

25:28.720 --> 25:31.160
and I'm still so enthusiastic about Linode

25:31.160 --> 25:33.880
because I just feel like if you knew about it,

25:33.880 --> 25:35.540
you could build something really special, too,

25:35.540 --> 25:37.680
because they've got 11 data centers around the world,

25:37.680 --> 25:39.440
so you can build something close to you.

25:39.440 --> 25:41.520
They have outrageously great performance,

25:41.520 --> 25:43.760
and they have been focused on one thing

25:43.760 --> 25:46.600
since the very beginning, making cloud computing accessible

25:46.600 --> 25:47.800
to everyone and affordable.

25:47.800 --> 25:51.600
That's it, that whole package right there, that concept,

25:51.600 --> 25:55.480
that cloud computing should be easy to use, easy to deploy,

25:55.480 --> 25:56.280
and affordable.

25:56.280 --> 25:58.960
That's like a trifecta of what Linode's all about,

25:58.960 --> 26:01.460
and they've been doing that for 18 years.

26:01.460 --> 26:04.440
Who else do you know who it's really almost 19 years now?

26:04.440 --> 26:06.820
That is some serious focus and dedication,

26:06.820 --> 26:09.560
and that $100 that they're giving you to try it,

26:09.560 --> 26:11.240
that's a confidence thing, right?

26:11.240 --> 26:13.080
That's them saying, you're going to try this,

26:13.080 --> 26:15.440
you're going to actually use it when you have $100,

26:15.440 --> 26:16.520
and we know you're going to like it,

26:16.520 --> 26:18.220
and you're going to stick around.

26:18.220 --> 26:21.160
It's great, and they're always investing in performance.

26:21.160 --> 26:24.220
They've just begun rolling out some beautifully fast PCI

26:24.220 --> 26:26.040
MVME storage, so that's something

26:26.040 --> 26:28.740
you might want to think about if you've got an application that

26:28.740 --> 26:30.640
needs some serious IOPS, and their support team

26:30.640 --> 26:32.960
will always work with you to kind of figure that stuff out,

26:32.960 --> 26:34.640
and they're not going to try to get you.

26:34.640 --> 26:35.680
They have great support.

26:35.680 --> 26:38.080
That's what they're known for is their fantastic support.

26:38.080 --> 26:40.080
Well, one of the things they're known for.

26:40.080 --> 26:42.480
I mean, when you do something this good for 18 years,

26:42.480 --> 26:44.080
you get a good reputation.

26:44.080 --> 26:46.880
They've also been a big supporter of the free software

26:46.880 --> 26:48.600
community for a while.

26:48.600 --> 26:51.240
A lot of times, we're doing research on projects,

26:51.240 --> 26:53.800
and we'll come across their GitHub page or their blog,

26:53.800 --> 26:56.760
and right there, they'll have a logo sponsored by Linode.

26:56.760 --> 26:59.360
Some of my favorite projects, like Kubuntu and Linux Fest

26:59.360 --> 27:01.920
Northwest, sponsored by Linode, and of course,

27:01.920 --> 27:04.200
they sponsor a lot of Linux media these days.

27:04.200 --> 27:06.400
That's massive.

27:06.400 --> 27:08.440
And I love where they're going.

27:08.440 --> 27:11.840
I chat with them on the regular, and I get the inside scoop

27:11.840 --> 27:13.920
on what's coming next, and I happen

27:13.920 --> 27:16.680
to know it's something that is going to be really useful.

27:16.680 --> 27:18.040
So if you're a performance hound,

27:18.040 --> 27:19.780
or if you want something that's just simple,

27:19.780 --> 27:22.160
or maybe you're looking to have a hybrid cloud set up

27:22.160 --> 27:25.840
so you don't have every egg in every single hyperscaler

27:25.840 --> 27:28.520
basket out there, I think you know what I'm talking about.

27:28.520 --> 27:30.520
Linode could work great in that scenario, too.

27:30.520 --> 27:33.280
So go get the $100, support the show, try it,

27:33.280 --> 27:34.840
and learn something.

27:34.840 --> 27:36.040
What a great opportunity.

27:36.040 --> 27:38.520
It's linode.com slash unplugged.

27:38.520 --> 27:44.120
We got some great feedback this week, as always.

27:44.120 --> 27:47.240
So please continue sending those in, linuxunplugged.com

27:47.240 --> 27:49.480
slash contact.

27:49.480 --> 27:52.720
Micah says, first, I want to tell every Jupyter broadcasting

27:52.720 --> 27:54.400
listener out there something.

27:54.400 --> 27:57.600
If you ever have a chance to go to a JB meetup,

27:57.600 --> 27:59.600
do yourself a favor and go.

27:59.600 --> 28:02.800
I drove up from Portland for the meetup last Sunday,

28:02.800 --> 28:04.400
and it was a blast.

28:04.400 --> 28:06.960
The JB crew is a warm and welcoming bunch,

28:06.960 --> 28:08.440
and it was great to spend the day

28:08.440 --> 28:11.040
with a group of fellow Linux enthusiasts.

28:11.040 --> 28:12.560
It was like being with old friends

28:12.560 --> 28:13.960
that you've never met before.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.720
I can't wait for the next one.

28:15.720 --> 28:17.680
I completely agree with that.

28:17.680 --> 28:20.680
It's like meeting old friends that you didn't know.

28:20.680 --> 28:23.480
It's a weird thing, because, I mean, you're human.

28:23.480 --> 28:26.800
So you've got about five minutes of like, hey, hi,

28:26.800 --> 28:28.000
my name's so-and-so.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.160
Oh, yeah, OK, how do you do?

28:29.160 --> 28:29.880
What do you do?

28:29.880 --> 28:32.040
The initial social anxiety that we all have.

28:32.040 --> 28:34.480
If you can survive that five minutes, after that,

28:34.480 --> 28:36.840
it's like you've been hanging out with these people for 20

28:36.840 --> 28:37.360
years.

28:37.360 --> 28:40.160
And it was such a great group of people

28:40.160 --> 28:44.320
that afterwards, Wes and I were talking to each other like,

28:44.320 --> 28:47.400
it's pretty rad that a group of people that awesome

28:47.400 --> 28:48.840
live in the Pacific Northwest.

28:48.840 --> 28:50.840
We were like, yay, go Pacific Northwest.

28:50.840 --> 28:52.320
No kidding.

28:52.320 --> 28:54.960
I mean, they're all over wherever we have an audience.

28:54.960 --> 28:56.000
Yeah, for sure, yeah.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.640
That some of the awesome audience is around us, wow.

28:58.640 --> 29:00.940
But I would totally hang out with that same group of people

29:00.940 --> 29:03.080
again, and I hope we will.

29:03.080 --> 29:08.000
Also, just kind of incredible is listener Jose

29:08.000 --> 29:09.640
made the trip out here.

29:09.640 --> 29:12.600
You may recall Jose also made the trip to Denver,

29:12.600 --> 29:15.240
and he won a Raspberry Pi that Linode gave away.

29:15.240 --> 29:18.720
Jose is visually impaired and lives in Puerto Rico

29:18.720 --> 29:20.280
and made the trip out to Seattle.

29:20.280 --> 29:22.960
Never been to Seattle before, but came out for us.

29:22.960 --> 29:25.080
That's just a highlight.

29:25.080 --> 29:25.680
It's wild.

29:25.680 --> 29:26.360
It was a highlight.

29:26.360 --> 29:27.240
It really was.

29:27.240 --> 29:32.560
And it's inspiring too, and he's a developer by day.

29:32.560 --> 29:35.280
So we can sit down there and just talk shop,

29:35.280 --> 29:36.640
and it's so much fun.

29:36.640 --> 29:39.360
And he's got the perspective of doing it from Puerto Rico, which

29:39.360 --> 29:41.160
is fascinating.

29:41.160 --> 29:43.400
And the whole crew was just great to talk to.

29:43.400 --> 29:45.720
Everybody was in conversation.

29:45.720 --> 29:47.120
There was nobody left out.

29:47.120 --> 29:49.840
Nobody was in the corner being socially awkward.

29:49.840 --> 29:50.760
Everybody clicked.

29:50.760 --> 29:52.880
There was food and cookies for plenty.

29:52.880 --> 29:56.200
I still have food and cookies here.

29:56.200 --> 29:58.320
So I want to do another one in a few months.

29:58.320 --> 29:59.840
Of course, I want to do them on the road, too,

29:59.840 --> 30:00.840
so we can spread these out.

30:00.840 --> 30:01.360
Absolutely.

30:01.360 --> 30:03.720
And one day, I want to fly around the world and do these,

30:03.720 --> 30:06.400
but that's more of a time and budget thing.

30:06.400 --> 30:06.960
We'll get there.

30:06.960 --> 30:07.800
We'll get there.

30:07.800 --> 30:10.240
But I could see doing one in the late spring or something.

30:10.240 --> 30:11.200
I don't know.

30:11.200 --> 30:12.880
I've got to get my juke stuff figured out.

30:12.880 --> 30:14.680
Once I get Lady Jukes figured out,

30:14.680 --> 30:16.140
and I know what I'm doing with that,

30:16.140 --> 30:18.060
then I can start planning the rest of my life.

30:18.060 --> 30:19.720
That old hierarchy of needs.

30:19.720 --> 30:21.200
You're still working on shelter.

30:21.200 --> 30:22.440
You know, if you do a string of meetups

30:22.440 --> 30:24.200
during the winter as a regular thing,

30:24.200 --> 30:27.560
you wouldn't have these rat problems, Chris.

30:27.560 --> 30:30.200
I just keep moving, and they can never find their way in.

30:30.200 --> 30:30.680
That's it.

30:30.680 --> 30:32.320
Although, you know, I'll end up just going somewhere else

30:32.320 --> 30:34.240
that has rats, these damn things.

30:34.240 --> 30:35.040
They're everywhere.

30:35.040 --> 30:37.800
Or you'll find exciting new pests from other regions.

30:37.800 --> 30:40.640
So I know we got some nopics adventures that we were.

30:40.640 --> 30:42.240
We got a lot of nopics adventures,

30:42.240 --> 30:43.260
but I know there was at least one we

30:43.260 --> 30:44.640
wanted to talk about on there.

30:44.640 --> 30:47.080
We got a lot of them, and we've been talking about them,

30:47.080 --> 30:49.000
which is really great.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.360
But we got one from Tristan that I thought would be a really

30:51.360 --> 30:53.560
fun story to tell.

30:53.560 --> 30:55.640
For most of the time my kids were growing up,

30:55.640 --> 30:59.480
I had a semi-profitable side hustle repairing Windows systems.

30:59.480 --> 31:02.080
I wound up doing it often enough to have a nopics terminal

31:02.080 --> 31:04.000
server I could pixie boot.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.880
My daughters would frequently use the nopics pixie boot option

31:06.880 --> 31:09.520
to bypass the network printer restrictions on their school

31:09.520 --> 31:11.800
laptops so they could print their assignments out

31:11.800 --> 31:13.080
at my house.

31:13.080 --> 31:16.680
As many times as those speedy live sessions saved my bacon,

31:16.680 --> 31:18.640
I was asked to meet with her principal

31:18.640 --> 31:22.120
because my daughter had been selling live nopics USB boot

31:22.120 --> 31:24.680
sticks to classmates who were interested in bypassing

31:24.680 --> 31:27.360
the school-issued laptop restrictions for less

31:27.360 --> 31:30.200
academic and savory purposes.

31:30.200 --> 31:31.200
Wow.

31:31.200 --> 31:32.120
The lesson?

31:32.120 --> 31:35.560
If you find yourself finding back doors into systems

31:35.560 --> 31:37.480
when kids are around, be aware.

31:37.480 --> 31:40.040
They absorb everything, they solve problems quickly,

31:40.040 --> 31:44.400
and they don't always wrestle with the moral implications.

31:44.400 --> 31:45.080
Good advice.

31:45.080 --> 31:47.040
That's a good little victory for a kid, too,

31:47.040 --> 31:49.080
when you figure out a bypass like that.

31:49.080 --> 31:51.440
That's not even a thing we got into with the nopics stuff,

31:51.440 --> 31:54.840
but it was also great for all kinds of stuff like that.

31:54.840 --> 31:56.920
A Windows system that was totally locked down,

31:56.920 --> 31:59.560
but the USB ports were there, and you'd just plug in

31:59.560 --> 32:01.160
and just completely bypass it.

32:01.160 --> 32:03.560
Yeah, a lot of people back then would forget to lock down

32:03.560 --> 32:05.000
the bootloader or the BIOS.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.480
Yeah.

32:06.480 --> 32:09.760
Brings back the memories, the member berries.

32:09.760 --> 32:12.080
OK, all right, we have an email from Justin.

32:12.080 --> 32:14.240
Yeah, Justin writes in, it was fun

32:14.240 --> 32:17.120
to hear you guys talk about nopics and the live CD.

32:17.120 --> 32:18.760
A little after the turn of the century,

32:18.760 --> 32:21.560
I was working at Best Buy's tech bench, which

32:21.560 --> 32:23.520
changed to the Geek Squad.

32:23.520 --> 32:26.720
And we had nopics disks laying around.

32:26.720 --> 32:28.840
You ultimately had a ruined Windows install

32:28.840 --> 32:31.280
and needed to rescue data for the customer.

32:31.280 --> 32:33.480
Nopics was an invaluable tool that

32:33.480 --> 32:36.960
saved countless people's family photos and documents.

32:36.960 --> 32:38.640
Yeah, that's a great point right there.

32:38.640 --> 32:41.960
I mean, I think it was one of the earlier times

32:41.960 --> 32:44.760
where you had access to that amazing recovery environment.

32:44.760 --> 32:48.600
Yeah, and the fact that you could boot up in Linux,

32:48.600 --> 32:51.280
mount the Windows partition, and then

32:51.280 --> 32:55.200
use the network or another removable disk

32:55.200 --> 32:56.520
to save the data.

32:56.520 --> 32:59.400
Especially compared to having to boot into a Windows installer

32:59.400 --> 33:02.560
recovery environment, which is so limited in comparison.

33:02.560 --> 33:04.200
It's just no good, no good at all.

33:04.200 --> 33:06.640
It also made me think a little higher of Best Buy repair

33:06.640 --> 33:07.800
people, I don't know.

33:07.800 --> 33:10.600
Maybe it's just me and I'm fixing my own stuff at home,

33:10.600 --> 33:12.920
but I never really knew what they did behind that desk,

33:12.920 --> 33:14.480
and now I know a little bit more.

33:14.480 --> 33:16.080
Well, they have to deal with the public,

33:16.080 --> 33:17.400
so you got to respect them for that at least.

33:17.400 --> 33:18.240
Yeah, there's that.

33:18.240 --> 33:20.760
They have to deal with, and people are not happy

33:20.760 --> 33:23.160
when their machines break, and they probably often.

33:23.160 --> 33:24.440
Especially when they broke them.

33:24.440 --> 33:26.160
If they buy them from Best Buy, they probably

33:26.160 --> 33:28.680
come in there expecting Best Buy to fix them for free, too.

33:28.680 --> 33:32.200
So I could see them being just little turds about that.

33:32.200 --> 33:33.960
So they probably have to deal with a lot,

33:33.960 --> 33:35.920
so mad respect actually to them.

33:35.920 --> 33:36.600
Fair enough.

33:36.600 --> 33:37.800
The fact that, you know.

33:37.800 --> 33:39.260
It's like helping your family, but you

33:39.260 --> 33:40.420
don't love these strangers.

33:40.420 --> 33:42.520
There's probably a few bad ones.

33:42.520 --> 33:44.000
It's not the whole batch.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.680
Axel wrote in from Sweden as well.

33:46.680 --> 33:50.000
He said, I know a live USB stick can save a PC,

33:50.000 --> 33:52.080
but has it ever saved your phone?

33:52.080 --> 33:53.920
A couple of years ago, my dad lost his phone

33:53.920 --> 33:56.240
in my parents' house, and it was impossible to find.

33:56.240 --> 33:59.320
For some reason, the Find My Android alarm didn't work,

33:59.320 --> 34:01.560
but I could see that it was connected to the Wi-Fi

34:01.560 --> 34:02.640
somewhere.

34:02.640 --> 34:05.520
The battery was draining, and time was ticking.

34:05.520 --> 34:07.640
Turns out you can measure the Wi-Fi signal strength

34:07.640 --> 34:09.800
to other devices in Kismet.

34:09.800 --> 34:11.240
Now, this is Brent speaking.

34:11.240 --> 34:12.240
I've never used Kismet.

34:12.240 --> 34:13.840
Has one of you guys used Kismet?

34:13.840 --> 34:15.560
I don't know if I've used it specifically,

34:15.560 --> 34:18.200
but I've used a tool similar to Kismet.

34:18.200 --> 34:21.560
And it is really amazing what's going on

34:21.560 --> 34:23.760
in the wireless spectrum when you start looking at it.

34:23.760 --> 34:25.680
Have you ever looked at any of these Wi-Fi analyzer tools?

34:25.680 --> 34:26.480
Oh, yeah.

34:26.480 --> 34:26.980
Yeah.

34:26.980 --> 34:28.960
Wi-Fi analyzer is the classic app.

34:28.960 --> 34:30.840
I think I have used Kismet now and again,

34:30.840 --> 34:33.440
but it's been a few years since I had the whole Aircrack

34:33.440 --> 34:35.380
and the whole suite of tools for pulling around

34:35.380 --> 34:36.000
with this stuff.

34:36.000 --> 34:36.500
Oh, yeah.

34:36.500 --> 34:42.060
Back in the day, I definitely had a specific wireless card

34:42.060 --> 34:44.400
that I could put into, I think they called it promiscuous mode,

34:44.400 --> 34:45.280
but I can't remember.

34:45.280 --> 34:48.520
Some mode you put it into, promiscuous card.

34:48.520 --> 34:51.200
Yeah, you were already in that mode, but separate story.

34:51.200 --> 34:52.840
Hey-o, that's true.

34:52.840 --> 34:55.400
But I remember getting a specific card,

34:55.400 --> 34:57.840
and it worked with very specific software.

34:57.840 --> 35:00.840
And you could do all kinds of things back then.

35:00.840 --> 35:03.640
I mean, Wi-Fi is in a much better shape

35:03.640 --> 35:04.760
than it was a decade ago.

35:04.760 --> 35:06.940
Sounds like at least, according to this page,

35:06.940 --> 35:09.760
Kismet now works to some degree under WSL.

35:09.760 --> 35:11.760
So how about that?

35:11.760 --> 35:12.960
That's just great.

35:12.960 --> 35:15.520
So I actually said, it was actually too hard for me

35:15.520 --> 35:18.200
to install at the time, which it sounds like these days

35:18.200 --> 35:19.640
is much easier.

35:19.640 --> 35:22.680
He continues, so I booted up a Kali Linux USB stick

35:22.680 --> 35:25.840
and walk around with my laptop until the signal was

35:25.840 --> 35:26.760
at its strongest.

35:26.760 --> 35:29.560
Turns out the phone was directly below me in the basement.

35:29.560 --> 35:33.200
I finally found it laying on a sponge.

35:33.200 --> 35:35.480
That is so great.

35:35.480 --> 35:37.120
What a great way to find your phone.

35:37.120 --> 35:37.960
Yeah.

35:37.960 --> 35:39.960
That's a USB little like, that's what

35:39.960 --> 35:41.040
I was saying last week, too.

35:41.040 --> 35:43.460
It's like, just keep a few of these with you at all times.

35:43.460 --> 35:45.200
You never know what problems you can solve.

35:45.200 --> 35:48.760
And he did it without a tile tracker thing or whatever.

35:48.760 --> 35:50.120
Look at him go.

35:50.120 --> 35:51.440
Air Snort was the app.

35:51.440 --> 35:54.760
Yeah, Diddle and Gerald got it right.

35:54.760 --> 35:57.080
Air Snort and Air Snort NG eventually.

35:57.080 --> 35:59.520
Wow, you got to have an NG.

35:59.520 --> 36:00.400
Oh, great.

36:00.400 --> 36:03.720
Well, that really was, those were all hitting the memories.

36:03.720 --> 36:06.560
LinuxUnplugged.com slash contact if you've

36:06.560 --> 36:08.760
got something you want to mention, an idea for the show,

36:08.760 --> 36:10.440
or a response to something we talked about.

36:10.440 --> 36:15.400
A few things to tell you about here in the housekeeping

36:15.400 --> 36:15.960
section.

36:15.960 --> 36:18.520
First of all, thank you to our members.

36:18.520 --> 36:20.320
We do only have one sponsor right now,

36:20.320 --> 36:22.160
and so the members are keeping us going.

36:22.160 --> 36:25.040
Like, it's literally that.

36:25.040 --> 36:27.080
So thank you to our members, UnpluggedCore.com.

36:27.080 --> 36:29.040
And if you want to support the entire network,

36:29.040 --> 36:33.200
get all of the shows ad-free, you can go to jupyter.party.

36:33.200 --> 36:34.760
But we do also have that live version.

36:34.760 --> 36:37.280
That's actually what makes it in the jupyter.party feed.

36:37.280 --> 36:39.560
That's where you get to hear Wes cursing and.

36:39.560 --> 36:40.680
It happens, folks.

36:40.680 --> 36:43.520
Talking about food, I don't know, random stuff.

36:43.520 --> 36:44.800
Really, we just have two shows.

36:44.800 --> 36:46.100
We actually, I mean, we're geeks.

36:46.100 --> 36:47.560
We talk about geeky stuff.

36:47.560 --> 36:49.040
That's what happens every single time.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.800
You get all of that when you become a member.

36:50.800 --> 36:52.960
So that's at UnpluggedCore.com or the whole network

36:52.960 --> 36:54.920
at jupyter.party.

36:54.920 --> 36:57.200
Also, I want to tell you about our matrix community.

36:57.200 --> 36:57.940
It's growing.

36:57.940 --> 37:00.600
And one of the things that people say about Telegram

37:00.600 --> 37:03.560
is it's nice for your phone, but it's just one thread.

37:03.560 --> 37:06.080
So there's all kinds of conversations going on.

37:06.080 --> 37:07.040
Well, that's awesome.

37:07.040 --> 37:08.680
And a lot of our hosts pop in there

37:08.680 --> 37:10.560
throughout the week at jupyterbroadcasting.com

37:10.560 --> 37:12.280
slash telegram.

37:12.280 --> 37:15.720
Our matrix community, that's been separated out

37:15.720 --> 37:17.280
into topics and shows.

37:17.280 --> 37:19.560
And so things stay on topic and in the individual rooms.

37:19.560 --> 37:20.560
And it's pretty great.

37:20.560 --> 37:22.640
It's where we also have our JB cryptocurrency

37:22.640 --> 37:25.480
chat going on, where we have rational,

37:25.480 --> 37:27.800
reasonable conversations.

37:27.800 --> 37:29.360
And Wes is always trying to sell his NFTs.

37:29.360 --> 37:33.560
I was going to say, at least until Chris shows up.

37:33.560 --> 37:35.440
Zing, dude, zing.

37:35.440 --> 37:37.840
So that's at linuxunplugged.com slash matrix

37:37.840 --> 37:39.720
for information about that.

37:39.720 --> 37:41.400
Our mumble room for information about that

37:41.400 --> 37:44.520
is at linuxunplugged.com slash mumble.

37:44.520 --> 37:46.560
And they were in there this Sunday,

37:46.560 --> 37:48.740
chatting before we even got started.

37:48.740 --> 37:49.580
So reliable.

37:49.580 --> 37:50.400
And we loved it.

37:50.400 --> 37:51.240
That's great.

37:51.240 --> 37:53.920
It's like a slice of the experience of the meetup thing,

37:53.920 --> 37:56.480
because you get like-minded folks

37:56.480 --> 37:59.760
who are informed about this stuff and want to learn.

37:59.760 --> 38:01.480
Hit new folks, regulars, a great mix.

38:01.480 --> 38:02.360
So that's pretty nice.

38:02.360 --> 38:06.600
So details for our mumble, linuxunplugged.com slash mumble.

38:06.600 --> 38:09.840
Love to have you there.

38:09.840 --> 38:12.960
Now, we do have a very special pick.

38:12.960 --> 38:14.840
We wanted to work it into the show this week,

38:14.840 --> 38:16.720
because it's important, but it didn't

38:16.720 --> 38:17.920
fit with the overall theme.

38:17.920 --> 38:19.280
So we're making a pick out of it.

38:19.280 --> 38:20.840
I'm just being honest with you.

38:20.840 --> 38:25.200
Slackware 15.0 officially released this week.

38:25.200 --> 38:29.160
It ships with Linux 5.15, which is the LTS kernel.

38:29.160 --> 38:30.820
Probably pretty appropriate.

38:30.820 --> 38:35.640
And I got to say, their release page is really a work of art.

38:35.640 --> 38:38.440
It is a time capsule in of itself.

38:38.440 --> 38:40.080
It's worth looking at just for that.

38:40.080 --> 38:42.760
I love that it starts with breaking news.

38:42.760 --> 38:45.880
Semaca, Minnesota.

38:45.880 --> 38:47.040
Good for them.

38:47.040 --> 38:52.600
And this release is also associated with some losses,

38:52.600 --> 38:55.920
people close to the project from the last couple of years.

38:55.920 --> 38:57.680
And it made me really appreciate the fact

38:57.680 --> 39:01.720
that Patrick is still around, Slackware is still around,

39:01.720 --> 39:05.600
because some OGs in that project were lost recently.

39:05.600 --> 39:09.000
And that's going to be a thing that happens more and more

39:09.000 --> 39:12.160
as part of our community ages a bit.

39:12.160 --> 39:15.920
And I'm grateful that we still are getting releases of Slackware

39:15.920 --> 39:17.000
after all these years.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.040
I mean, this one looks like a good one, too.

39:19.040 --> 39:21.200
There's some modern stuff in here that brought in Rust

39:21.200 --> 39:22.240
and Python 3.

39:22.240 --> 39:24.280
There's Pipewire and Wayland support.

39:24.280 --> 39:25.440
Did you say Rust?

39:25.440 --> 39:26.520
I sure did.

39:26.520 --> 39:29.320
Yeah, and it looks like you can get 5.16 if you

39:29.320 --> 39:33.200
want to go for it and get really the latest stuff.

39:33.200 --> 39:36.160
And Sendmail, it's been moved and the way

39:36.160 --> 39:37.640
has been made for Postfix.

39:37.640 --> 39:38.120
Yeah, all right.

39:38.120 --> 39:39.120
That's a big transition.

39:39.120 --> 39:40.600
Yeah, wow.

39:40.600 --> 39:43.120
About time, I'd say.

39:43.120 --> 39:46.080
We joke, but actually we have a lot of respect for Slackware,

39:46.080 --> 39:48.480
Patrick, and the entire project.

39:48.480 --> 39:50.600
And we appreciate that release, so go check it out.

39:50.600 --> 39:52.400
We'll have a link in the show notes.

39:52.400 --> 39:55.040
But we do have one more thing to get into.

39:55.040 --> 39:57.480
This came up in the Mumble Room before we started.

39:57.480 --> 40:00.900
It's something that Grubb's been capable of for a long time.

40:00.900 --> 40:02.200
I didn't know about it.

40:02.200 --> 40:07.400
And I got to acknowledge that because if I did know about it,

40:07.400 --> 40:09.800
I would have told you guys immediately.

40:09.800 --> 40:11.680
But this week, we're going to link you

40:11.680 --> 40:14.240
to something that's going to take your Grubb bootloader

40:14.240 --> 40:15.680
to the next level.

40:15.680 --> 40:18.960
You can really crank it to 11 with Grubb Tunes.

40:18.960 --> 40:20.800
And we have a website that Wes has found

40:20.800 --> 40:23.320
that lets you test out the tunes that

40:23.320 --> 40:24.440
will play when Grubb loads.

40:24.440 --> 40:27.240
Give us an example there, Wes.

40:27.240 --> 40:30.360
I mean, how amazing is that, right?

40:30.360 --> 40:32.560
Your computer boots up, and right before the Grubb menu

40:32.560 --> 40:37.720
pops up on your screen, right through the PC speaker.

40:37.720 --> 40:40.120
Like, who doesn't want that blasting in their PC speaker?

40:40.120 --> 40:43.520
Now, we should note that this is all early boot time.

40:43.520 --> 40:46.120
Grubb's not going to really work multi-threaded here,

40:46.120 --> 40:48.720
so you do have to wait for the whole tune

40:48.720 --> 40:50.720
to play before booting continues.

40:50.720 --> 40:52.520
So maybe choose the short one.

40:52.520 --> 40:55.440
Yeah, like just a coin or something like that.

40:55.440 --> 40:57.360
I mean, and keep in mind, it is going

40:57.360 --> 40:58.760
to play through your PC speaker.

40:58.760 --> 41:02.240
So that's also something.

41:02.240 --> 41:04.240
See, that's perfect, right?

41:04.240 --> 41:06.360
So this website that we're linking to,

41:06.360 --> 41:08.280
it lets you test these out before you actually

41:08.280 --> 41:08.760
commit them.

41:08.760 --> 41:12.080
Yeah, Grubb Init Tune Tester, because it's basically,

41:12.080 --> 41:14.720
let's see, the format is tempo, and then you

41:14.720 --> 41:16.600
have a series of frequency and duration.

41:16.600 --> 41:18.840
So you're actually specifying what frequency the speaker

41:18.840 --> 41:20.280
to play, and then for how long.

41:20.280 --> 41:21.920
So it's a little unintuitive.

41:21.920 --> 41:23.720
You might want to be able to test this faster

41:23.720 --> 41:27.200
than having to reboot or use a VM.

41:27.200 --> 41:28.080
Hey, we got a newbie.

41:28.080 --> 41:29.520
We got newbies in the chat room.

41:29.520 --> 41:31.760
We do this show live on Sundays now.

41:31.760 --> 41:34.120
We start at noon Pacific, 3 PM Eastern.

41:34.120 --> 41:36.840
And it's a lot of fun to have you guys in the Mumble Room,

41:36.840 --> 41:39.240
even if you're just in the quiet listening or in the chat room.

41:39.240 --> 41:41.720
It gives us a special kind of energy.

41:41.720 --> 41:42.520
It gets us going.

41:42.520 --> 41:43.200
It's exciting.

41:43.200 --> 41:45.560
And you also get to help us title the show,

41:45.560 --> 41:47.360
and you get a lot more show as well.

41:47.360 --> 41:49.640
So we do that at jblive.tv on a Sunday.

41:49.640 --> 41:51.180
And of course, we always appreciate

41:51.180 --> 41:52.360
you just downloading and listening.

41:52.360 --> 41:54.240
Maybe you've always just got it via the podcast,

41:54.240 --> 41:56.080
and that's what works for you.

41:56.080 --> 42:01.080
Well, you're about 99% of the audience, maybe even 99.8.

42:01.080 --> 42:03.760
So we understand, and we appreciate you too.

42:03.760 --> 42:06.480
In fact, if I could add one more podcast,

42:06.480 --> 42:08.320
I mean, there's a whole bunch of good shows

42:08.320 --> 42:09.720
at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

42:09.720 --> 42:11.360
Yeah, how are you going to pick just one?

42:11.360 --> 42:14.040
In fact, like Coder Radio and Self Hosted,

42:14.040 --> 42:16.360
I think they are do not misses.

42:16.360 --> 42:20.680
But speaking specifically to the Linux audience,

42:20.680 --> 42:22.840
you got to go get Linux Action News.

42:22.840 --> 42:24.680
Nice and tight, just what you need to know,

42:24.680 --> 42:26.880
broken down in a way that's easily to understand,

42:26.880 --> 42:28.520
gets you right through it without the hype,

42:28.520 --> 42:30.520
linuxactionnews.com.

42:30.520 --> 42:32.520
It's like a whole other aspect of the show.

42:32.520 --> 42:34.440
We filter the fluff so you don't have to.

42:34.440 --> 42:36.240
We look back at Linux Action Show and thought,

42:36.240 --> 42:39.800
let's take the news segment and just really hone that in,

42:39.800 --> 42:41.840
and just give you the stuff that matters.

42:41.840 --> 42:43.780
And so you can get that at Linux Action News.

42:43.780 --> 42:44.620
Go get that.

42:44.620 --> 42:47.520
Otherwise, we just appreciate you joining us.

42:47.520 --> 42:50.840
Show comes out now late Sundays, Pacific time,

42:50.840 --> 42:52.360
early Mondays for most of the world.

42:52.360 --> 42:53.180
Who can keep track?

42:53.180 --> 42:54.020
Just subscribe.

42:54.020 --> 42:56.160
There's like an automated feed.

42:56.160 --> 42:57.400
That's what I would do.

42:57.400 --> 42:58.240
Yeah.

42:58.240 --> 43:00.120
Don't let the machine handle it.

43:00.120 --> 43:03.280
And don't forget, go get a new podcast app,

43:03.280 --> 43:05.960
newpodcastapps.com, and then send us a boost.

43:05.960 --> 43:07.920
We're watching your boost-a-grams,

43:07.920 --> 43:10.000
highlight of our day when one of those comes in.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.240
And if you don't know what I'm talking about,

43:11.240 --> 43:13.520
go check out newpodcastapps.com.

43:13.520 --> 43:15.280
There's a whole new index out there.

43:15.280 --> 43:16.800
Of course, you can also subscribe directly

43:16.800 --> 43:19.440
at linuxunplug.com slash subscribe.

43:19.440 --> 43:20.680
That's where we have all the feeds.

43:20.680 --> 43:23.000
Or just download the MP3 and play it with VLC

43:23.000 --> 43:25.120
like I do sometimes, you animal.

43:25.120 --> 43:26.320
Thanks so much for joining us.

43:26.320 --> 43:27.160
See you next week.

43:27.160 --> 43:54.980
Where are you?

43:57.160 --> 44:08.780
All right, JBtitles.com, let's go pick our title and boat this thing.

44:08.780 --> 44:10.400
We got to give it a good name.

44:10.400 --> 44:15.680
You know, I wanted to mention the absolute highlight of my week, change my day sometimes

44:15.680 --> 44:20.460
is when one of these boosts comes in and they're often just like, you know, just a small amount

44:20.460 --> 44:24.680
of stats, but to get the live messages and to know the episode that people are listening

44:24.680 --> 44:29.160
to at the time, it's information I never knew I wanted.

44:29.160 --> 44:33.960
Something about the real time nature of these coming in with the show name on there and

44:33.960 --> 44:37.480
the little noise that Helipad makes when they come in, it's a delight.

44:37.480 --> 44:42.520
And what I think for these kind of value for value payments to really work, we need to

44:42.520 --> 44:45.640
be able to embed a button on the website.

44:45.640 --> 44:48.720
Developers need to be able to have a button like in their about page, like a link that

44:48.720 --> 44:49.720
you click.

44:49.720 --> 44:51.200
Yeah, you want it low friction.

44:51.200 --> 44:55.540
Yeah, because I think we could take this beyond just podcasts, but it needs to be outside

44:55.540 --> 44:59.400
just the podcast apps and a little bit like sending a message.

44:59.400 --> 45:05.960
I just I thanked a developer for building a basically a Python bot and I sent him some

45:05.960 --> 45:09.880
Litecoin, but he didn't, you know, when you just send somebody Litecoin, you don't know

45:09.880 --> 45:11.840
who it's from.

45:11.840 --> 45:12.840
Some coins that show up.

45:12.840 --> 45:13.840
Yeah.

45:13.840 --> 45:14.840
So then I had to like track down his contact page.

45:14.840 --> 45:17.760
I was like, hey, just so you know, I sent this in just because I really appreciate you

45:17.760 --> 45:22.920
working hard on this and like it just would be so nice if it was just one button and it

45:22.920 --> 45:26.840
just does it all and puts a message in there and sends it and they get it in real time.

45:26.840 --> 45:28.080
It's the greatest thing.

45:28.080 --> 45:29.080
It's the future.

45:29.080 --> 45:30.080
It's the way of the future.

45:30.080 --> 45:32.520
I have a question, a follow up question for you, Chris.

45:32.520 --> 45:33.520
Sure.

45:33.520 --> 45:37.400
What would it take for you to be interested in installing Ubuntu on your laptop?

45:37.400 --> 45:38.400
Hmm.

45:38.400 --> 45:44.760
Well, probably the latest Gnome stack and that includes like the latest GTK four and

45:44.760 --> 45:49.560
all of that, or, you know, have them go wild with a plasma.

45:49.560 --> 45:55.840
I mean, that, I mean, obviously I would immediately try that without question, but I think, uh,

45:55.840 --> 46:00.520
just really something, something like that, something that probably address, they could

46:00.520 --> 46:05.580
somehow address software availability a little bit more than just snaps and app packages.

46:05.580 --> 46:07.640
They probably need to redo the software center too.

46:07.640 --> 46:09.880
Like there's a few things in there.

46:09.880 --> 46:12.080
I'd love to have butter a fast support in the installer.

46:12.080 --> 46:13.080
I mean, it's not mandatory.

46:13.080 --> 46:15.720
And I, you know, ZFS for my data storage is fine.

46:15.720 --> 46:16.720
What about you?

46:16.720 --> 46:18.840
Can you, am I missing anything you can think of?

46:18.840 --> 46:22.200
I do like trying out the ZFS support of the installer from time to time, but I'm curious

46:22.200 --> 46:25.200
to see what happens with like some of their new flutter work.

46:25.200 --> 46:27.920
That's not enough to like keep me on a desktop necessarily.

46:27.920 --> 46:28.920
Not yet.

46:28.920 --> 46:29.920
You know, that's something we didn't touch on in the show.

46:29.920 --> 46:31.600
So I'm glad you brought this up, right?

46:31.600 --> 46:36.600
Is there are rumors of like a flutter desktop one day from Canonical.

46:36.600 --> 46:40.680
That's one of the rumors out there right now and that's something else I would immediately

46:40.680 --> 46:45.060
try with alpha labels or whatever, I would immediately try that.

46:45.060 --> 46:49.840
So it's just pushing the envelope forward a little bit, bringing something that, you

46:49.840 --> 46:55.440
know, cause one message that we've heard from a couple of developers now, and it really,

46:55.440 --> 47:01.040
I think came clear in the Lutris developer interview that we did is there was a period

47:01.040 --> 47:06.860
of time in desktop Linux where Ubuntu was setting the pace and so if Canonical built

47:06.860 --> 47:11.480
an app in a stack, then other people used that stack and it wasn't universally true.

47:11.480 --> 47:15.480
I'm not trying to imply like that was 100, that would never happen, but we've heard it

47:15.480 --> 47:19.120
from several different developers and I think the Lutris one was the most clear about it.

47:19.120 --> 47:21.600
Like they were taking Canonical's lead.

47:21.600 --> 47:25.800
And so then when Canonical stopped leading, they don't really know what to go to or where

47:25.800 --> 47:27.680
to go to next.

47:27.680 --> 47:29.200
And so I could see that being true for some developers.

47:29.200 --> 47:30.640
I don't think it's as necessary anymore.

47:30.640 --> 47:37.200
I think, I actually, I really think the whole GNOME GTK flat pack stack is really kind of

47:37.200 --> 47:38.560
starting to come together.

47:38.560 --> 47:42.280
So it may be less and less of an issue, that kind of thing going forward.

47:42.280 --> 47:45.400
But it really was, it was something that resonated with me is that there was a time where that

47:45.400 --> 47:46.400
was really true.

47:46.400 --> 47:49.400
And if they were going to do something like that with a Flutter desktop or they maybe

47:49.400 --> 47:55.000
ever tried like an experimental version where they basically made an official Kubuntu version.

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
Oh.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
Yeah.

47:57.000 --> 48:00.480
Cause it's not, cause you can't, so for some reason just using Kubuntu doesn't do it.

48:00.480 --> 48:01.800
Kubuntu is great.

48:01.800 --> 48:03.480
We've got it right here next to me.

48:03.480 --> 48:05.560
It's running on the OBS machine.

48:05.560 --> 48:10.060
Totally been a rock, but it's also something about the underlying system and maybe it's

48:10.060 --> 48:11.060
the fact that it's Debian.

48:11.060 --> 48:15.760
Cause I also, I'm not particularly drawn to Debian, even though I think it's a great distribution.

48:15.760 --> 48:17.260
I've used it on servers.

48:17.260 --> 48:18.260
We use it.

48:18.260 --> 48:19.600
I think it's totally viable.

48:19.600 --> 48:22.040
I think I'm just, I want to be done with apt.

48:22.040 --> 48:23.040
That's part of it.

48:23.040 --> 48:24.040
Hmm.

48:24.040 --> 48:25.040
That could be part of it.

48:25.040 --> 48:26.040
Yeah.

48:26.040 --> 48:27.040
Not that it's, I mean, it works fine.

48:27.040 --> 48:28.040
It works fine.

48:28.040 --> 48:29.040
I just.

48:29.040 --> 48:30.040
It's feeling a little old.

48:30.040 --> 48:35.240
I wonder if this is a personal observation, but I wonder if there's something to be said

48:35.240 --> 48:40.080
for the lack of in-person canonical sprints.

48:40.080 --> 48:45.160
I know they were doing those very often and in many parts of the world for their team

48:45.160 --> 48:49.000
and for obvious reasons, those have haven't happened in the last, I don't know, a couple

48:49.000 --> 48:50.280
of years.

48:50.280 --> 48:56.160
I wonder if there's a correlation there to their innovation internally versus those kind

48:56.160 --> 48:57.160
of in-person sprints.

48:57.160 --> 48:58.960
There's got to be something to that, right?

48:58.960 --> 48:59.960
I'll blame that.

48:59.960 --> 49:02.240
I mean, I don't think so, but I'll blame that.

49:02.240 --> 49:03.240
I like that.

49:03.240 --> 49:04.240
It at least doesn't help.

49:04.240 --> 49:06.760
I mean, if you could blame it on COVID, that's the best way to go.

49:06.760 --> 49:07.760
I think.

49:07.760 --> 49:10.720
Well, it's just, I know you, you know, I, I just came from a trip to the studio and

49:10.720 --> 49:15.760
how much should we get done while I was there versus, you know, our typical pace with.

49:15.760 --> 49:16.760
That's true.

49:16.760 --> 49:18.480
I mean, it was 80% remodels, but.

49:18.480 --> 49:19.480
That's true.

49:19.480 --> 49:20.480
Still.

49:20.480 --> 49:23.560
And you know, I've, I've been to a couple of those sprints and they really do just get

49:23.560 --> 49:24.560
a lot done.

49:24.560 --> 49:28.280
They all sit down in these different rooms and yeah, there might be something.

49:28.280 --> 49:30.280
Maybe you are onto something Brent.

49:30.280 --> 49:59.880
It's not one singular thing, but maybe that's a contributor.
