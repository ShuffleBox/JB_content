1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,960
Oh

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,720
My gosh you guys

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:08,840
You know, I'll tell you Noah. I had to have a talk with myself after your ThinkPad review and last that was a

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:16,900
Legitimately tempting review like after the things that the the the main things that really sold me was the problem-free

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,560
Built-in LTE modem and

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,800
The

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,800
Temporary battery so you could swap you could swap batteries. I'm big on that

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,040
I'm big on battery swap and I was I was king of battery one of the one of my favorite laptops of all time was

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:38,880
The Apple Pismo and it was like when Steve Jobs was gone and every bay was modular and compatible with each other

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,160
So DVD bays could also be battery bays

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,680
So you could have two batteries or two DVDs or a hard drive and a battery and I love that man

12
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,840
Cuz I get eight nine hours of battery life, you know

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,240
I don't want to make you I don't want to make you I don't want to make you too jealous

14
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:58,400
But Chris, do you know what my latest thing is on the ThinkPad what have you heard of the battery slice the what?

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,840
The battery slice is a battery literally the footprint of the laptop itself

16
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,680
Oh, and it goes underneath it kind of right underneath and that's not even new that's been around for a little bit

17
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,360
Actually, I've never I've not had one before and I had I had I had a 10-hour flight to Tokyo

18
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,320
I had a five-hour flight to Seattle. I had a one-hour flight to Minneapolis

19
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,400
I had two hours in the airport there at 200 in the airport in Tokyo and

20
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,280
I had my laptop powered on pretty much the whole time. Yeah, it went almost 24 hours

21
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,760
So this actually goes like in the docking port, right?

22
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:36,920
Yes, the battery slice attaches to so you have your extended battery plus you now have this battery which goes in your docking port, right?

23
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,920
It's crazy. Yeah, they've had that for a while. That's super cool

24
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,440
I used to I used to have one between all the batteries because of that power dock or they

25
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:52,480
Yeah, what do they call the power center at the yeah, you know, you know too bad. I really really really don't like Lenovo as a company

26
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,280
This is Linux unplugged episode

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
151 for June 28

28
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,440
2016

29
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,080
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's ready to go on vacation and is trusting the post-production

30
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,160
Process my name is Chris. My name is Noah. Hello there Noah. Thank you for joining me this week

31
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,400
You're actually back. You made it back from Tokyo. It wasn't it wasn't without a vent

32
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:36,000
Well, I'm glad you could make it because we have a great show today coming up a Linux mint 18 is just hitting the interwebs

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,680
I'll give you my quick take on that

34
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,600
I've got it installed on a machine and I kick the tires and then later on is desktop Linux almost dead

35
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,360
I don't mean actually like Linux on the desktop

36
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:54,440
I mean desktop computers in general now with these massive machines that are desktop replacements devices like the NUC and of course the penetration of

37
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,400
Mobile, you gotta wonder is there really a role for the truck anymore?

38
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,160
At least let's zoom out like 10 years and talk about the future of Linux on the desktop

39
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,620
Especially in light of some recent new hardware releases

40
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:10,000
Plus we've got great updates from the Red Hat summit from the Docker group

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
There could be in a new a new Ubuntu phone and develop

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What and much much more so Noah I am

43
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,760
Super looking forward to Linux unplugged 151 because 152 will not contain any Chris

44
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,400
So this is my last episode before I go on vacation

45
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:33,400
You'll sit down in the center seat at the helm and command the ship and your time. I couldn't I can't even believe you're here

46
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,920
I can't even believe you're here because I figured you're coming back from Tokyo. You're a busy guy

47
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,120
You got a lot of stuff to cover. I didn't catch up on

48
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,960
1159 at night when there's no flights to Grand Forks

49
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,760
So you end up spending a good amount of time in Seattle

50
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,560
it sounds like I ended up spending from 8 in the morning until like

51
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:57,200
650 in the Seattle Airport and I was to the point where I thought I was going to inadvertently be doing Linux unplugged in studio

52
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:04,000
And then and then I made a last last ditch effort flight and and got back to Minneapolis at midnight

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,120
And then rented a car and drove for four and a half hours back. Oh, no

54
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,840
I had a client that I had to take care of this morning and so I was I really I was expecting to be back on

55
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,440
Saturday and that didn't work out and then I was hoping to get back on Sunday and that didn't work out and so ended up

56
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,760
Being Monday very very very late man. It's always down to the wire, isn't it? Isn't it funny how that happens?

57
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:30,600
Better that way. It's true. That's true. I have this, you know, I'm my road trip. I'm coming. I'm going to Montana

58
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,680
I'm gonna do some soaking. I'm bringing Dylan with me. It's his first road trip. He's seven years old, you know

59
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,640
It's it's it's summer break between first grade and second grade for him

60
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,680
So this is like a big deal trip. This is like this is like the stakes are high

61
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,520
This is his first impression to road trips

62
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,760
So we really trying to make sure we just stock it full of fun stuff for him to do

63
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,440
So we're gonna stop along the way we're gonna be like the Lewis and Clark caverns

64
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,760
We're gonna go to water parks and all we basically have activities planned every single day

65
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,040
But as of right now, I still don't even have lady dupes back in my possession

66
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,640
Jeez, man, I know I am it is down to the wire. No, you are you're cutting it

67
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,880
Down to the wire. I'm really glad that you give yourself

68
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,640
Well that that that the circumstances have turned out so that you have so much leeway when something goes wrong

69
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,720
So so here's what I've learned. It's like owning a boat

70
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,440
I think I own an RV is like owning a boat where every time you kind of take it out on a major voyage

71
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,600
stuff breaks and

72
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,400
that's why you own RVs that have warranties that cover everything and

73
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
to their credit, you know, I

74
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,400
Everything has been covered for totally absolutely for free

75
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,120
The only problem is the delay as you authorize parts and you wait for that and that kind of thing

76
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:43,740
So, right, I don't even think this road trip is gonna be possible except for we've gotten great customer service by one individual

77
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,760
I'm gonna give him a shout out right here to Jeff. He's down at sunset RV

78
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,400
Now they have it

79
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:55,320
They have a main five location where we bought our rig but at a Buckley is where their maintenance divisions run and Jeff like

80
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,680
He's been calling up Thor and verifying. Are you authorizing this? Where's this at?

81
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:07,140
Can you put rush shipping on these parts and then he's gonna drive it up to our campsite as soon as it's ready to go

82
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,520
So that way we can start loading it up and pack it up

83
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,400
So we don't have to do that whole drive my truck down there jump in the rig and hit the road thing

84
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,460
We can actually pack it up at our at our regular site

85
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,000
so he's gonna drive it up there when as soon as they get done working on it, even that's Thursday night Friday night something like

86
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,880
that and I told him a few if he can bring it up there, I'll take him out for a beer

87
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,040
I leave Saturday morning. I leave Saturday morning. So it's like yeah. Oh

88
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:37,100
And then at some point you'll be hearing a lot more from Noah because he'll be sitting in in the seat right here

89
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,960
So let's jump into some of the stories. We have to get into this week

90
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,640
We got a lot of project updates a lot

91
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,960
And so without going too far without getting to them

92
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,840
I think we should probably bring in our virtual lug time appropriate greetings mama room. Hey pep

93
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:57,820
I'm okay. Hello. Hello. Hello. Well, hello. Hi there, you know, I wanted to talk about something

94
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:05,480
Right at the top of the show because mr. Drum edrum or perhaps you might know mishawn in the mumble room has worked on

95
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,160
Yeah, what I'm known

96
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,040
he worked on something special for me as a gift for last his 10th birthday and

97
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:19,060
It was a nice totally set up. We'll talk more about why it's super super cool

98
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:25,740
A setup installation of matter most for the Jupiter broadcasting community now we've talked about matter most in the past. That's that open-source

99
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:31,260
Alternative to slack always rocket chat. That's another one and this week

100
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:36,860
I wanted to highlight an article over at open source comm because I really ragged on them last week

101
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:41,460
So I thought it'd only be fair to highlight when they do something pretty cool to actually give them some credit. So I

102
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,900
Don't know if you had a chance to listen to last week's episode, but I I kind of called him out for a few things

103
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,540
and this week though, I thought they had a great post up here by Adam Hyde on

104
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:57,980
Open-source software needing to sell the user experience and I think a lot of us that listen to the show or participate in our virtual

105
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:05,180
Lug agree that user experience is a super important part of the end result and he talks about how matter most is doing open source

106
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:12,900
The right way about how they're creating a compelling project something that definitely competes with slack takes advantage of its open source heritage

107
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:19,500
Uses that to build into features have things like code highlighting and snippets that are way better than anything slack can do

108
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,340
while also providing a great interface and

109
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:27,860
So it was sort of I thought a great opportunity with this article just posted full link in the show notes if you guys want

110
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:33,860
To read it. Maybe we talked to Sean and and get his sort of back-end take on

111
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:39,220
matter most what it was like to set it up for something that could potentially be used at large scale and

112
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:45,140
Just sort of his overall thoughts on it. So Sean first of all, thanks for the 10th anniversary gift of saying that matter most

113
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:49,100
We had a cool opportunity to use it during our fedora review

114
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,540
We had a back channel thread going during last worked out super well

115
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:58,100
I kind of just want to hear your thoughts on setting up matter most for a production deployment and what you think of it as a

116
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,100
software technology

117
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:04,300
Yeah, it's really I think it's really it's really runs really well

118
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:09,140
During the floor of you everyone was John there the load on the server

119
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:17,540
Cp load was like point zero five. Yeah, it was seems like it was like 200 megabytes and it just just purrs like a kitten

120
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,700
Set up wise back when you did the rock the matter most and rocket chat review

121
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:29,860
I is when I started working on this and I actually created a script for digital ocean to put in the user data

122
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,100
field and so

123
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,100
You just paste paste that in there?

124
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,820
Set the variables for your configuration and

125
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:45,780
Let it rip. No, it goes through and it takes care of setting up the firewall setting up your admin user and generates

126
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,080
all new salts all passwords

127
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,780
sets up

128
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,020
The whole stack

129
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,940
And it also does sets up let's encrypt

130
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:03,980
So if you already have your a record cool, you can just set that up right during the install if not there are two

131
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,540
two admin scripts in the admin users home directory and

132
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:15,420
At that point you can just run one won't install a self sign cert and the other one will set up let's encrypt

133
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:21,940
And it'll also create a cron job. So auto renew. So what would you say once all this is set up?

134
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,860
Sorry, then you can go I just thought I just want to know for people that are that are listening right now that maybe

135
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,980
You have an open source project

136
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:32,860
They're involved in total commit time to getting matter most at a decent matter most installation at that set up

137
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,460
Total commit time. What would you say it is?

138
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,740
if you use my script

139
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,300
Three to five minutes. Can you link that to me in the IRC so I can put in the show notes and go ahead?

140
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,220
No, yeah, and to be clear when he says a script

141
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:49,060
He doesn't mean like you have to set digital ocean up and then log into the droplet and then run a script

142
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:53,300
That's not what he's talking about. He actually custom designed the script so that it can be dropped in

143
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:57,700
In the digital ocean control panel and then spun up. That is awesome

144
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:02,980
Yeah, and I wasn't even aware of that feature digital ocean and during Linux fest Northwest like two months ago

145
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:07,420
We were in the hotel lobby at like three. Why is it that the meeting time of the hotel lobby is like three in the morning?

146
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,300
Either you're there to pick up hookers or you're talking about Linux. That's

147
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,500
That's true. That's true. Well, there were no hookers and blow that night

148
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,140
So we were working on

149
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:23,060
We were working on our laptops and he was showing me how he could literally drop this script in you change like what?

150
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,900
Sean sevens variables and then you click on the button. There's

151
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,180
mostly you need to change variables, but there's like

152
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:35,900
30 other variables you can change if you want to really set it up and not have to do any configuration or if you want

153
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,980
to keep the configuration that you already have and set it up on a

154
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:45,580
Second droplet is like a failover or if you want to test something you can use the same configuration for both

155
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:51,380
You know, here's why Sean I think this is kind of an important thing and I'd I actually wouldn't mind just sort of double downing

156
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,380
on the double downing that sounds like a sandwich on this because

157
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,980
one of the things that

158
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,460
One of the reasons why Jupiter broadcasting

159
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,660
Accidentally started using slack

160
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,580
Was because it took me 35 seconds to try it and then I was like, oh

161
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:12,440
Well, we could actually use this and so this is basically the way the way the decision tree works for me

162
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:18,740
Is is this going to be a critical piece of technology to the operate to the successful operation of my business if it is

163
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,340
I would like to own it control it deploy it. However, if

164
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:28,220
Owning controlling and deploy it takes way more time than I have to dedicate to it. Then I will never do it

165
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,060
I will never get it done

166
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:34,020
So then I might as well just go use the hosted solution that seems to be from a reputable company

167
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,980
It's gonna be around for a while because at least then I'm using something versus not using anything at all

168
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:46,260
So by creating a script that makes it super fast and easy to deploy matter most you're you're you're making it much more competitive

169
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:51,380
I think with slack Sean. What was the first thing? I told you when you first telegram me and said

170
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,380
Why aren't you guys using matter most?

171
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,180
Because Chris would have to set it up

172
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,300
Did I say Chris's decision is based off of

173
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,140
Path of leaf is resistant Greece the least resistance

174
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,300
Damn it. You make me sound like a bastard. No, it's not

175
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:16,900
Oh, no, I just make it sound like like a person who has a lot of really important things to do and so

176
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:23,820
Delving in to to the specifics of setting up a server on a relatively new software platform is not really something you have the time

177
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,820
Or energy to tackle

178
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:30,020
Be willing to use it especially when you're not sure how much value it's actually gonna return to you

179
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:35,940
So, you know, you're not really willing to commit a half a day to something if it's maybe something nobody uses

180
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:41,940
Right because who would think that setting up something that's basically IRC would actually be useful. Why not just use IRC

181
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,940
I mean, that's that was my default thinking about it. And that was my my essential

182
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:51,940
Bias that I had my old man bias coming in until I actually tried it. So I don't know

183
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,460
Mr. Drum anything else you want to touch on on matter most before we move on? I

184
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:04,220
Don't think so then they're working on a federated system so you can have multiple matter most connect to each other. That's cool

185
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:10,140
That will be very nice. That will be very very nice. That's always something. I'm a big fan of

186
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:16,420
Speaking of fans. I I there is something going on over at system 76

187
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,400
They have a it's only going on for a little bit too

188
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,660
But they're lowering prices with that with with retweets of the or tweets of the hashtag

189
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:31,140
Ubuntu 76 for two days up to 350 dollars off and I I'm not saying I have inside knowledge

190
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:36,220
I'm just saying I have inside knowledge. That's all I'm saying and you have a little inside knowledge to know

191
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,740
There is someone in the works here. I'm just saying it's in your benefit to get in on this

192
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:44,480
Just put that out there. So if you check them out twitter.com slash system 76

193
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,860
they're tweeting about it right now the key is to tweet with hashtag Ubuntu 76 and

194
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:56,540
There's something they've been working for quite a while on really hard and they're super super excited about I've been getting telegrams

195
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,540
I mean, I shouldn't say this

196
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,540
unidentified sources

197
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:05,820
Have been informing me about what could be in the works and I'm just saying I'm pretty excited about it

198
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:09,060
So I've been retweeting and you guys should too because it'll be worth it

199
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,860
All right, speaking of what might be worth it. This might be worth buying

200
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:20,060
This could be my next and finally I might add the first Ubuntu phone I buy

201
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:26,940
It's called Midori and no it's not a GTK web browser based on web kit that you wish you could use but just doesn't have

202
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,500
Enough features it could be the next Ubuntu phone

203
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:37,860
That's at least according from reader Richard s over at OMG Ubuntu who pointed OMG Ubuntu to bug

204
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,460
155 1811

205
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,060
Obviously, I know what you're all thinking. It's right there in the name

206
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:49,680
This obviously points to a new Ubuntu phone actually the bug mentions a device code named Midori

207
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:57,440
With regards to a trust prompt issue that causes a reboot on the MX4 and a mystery new handset later on in the bug report

208
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:04,500
Director of engineering over at canonical who says the block says this will block Midori RC. Of course RC

209
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:12,240
Being a release candidate channel for Ubuntu touch images a quick googling around shows the Midori would be in keeping with the code names

210
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,160
for previous Ubuntu devices because they're based for some reason on

211
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,480
on Dragon Ball franchise references

212
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,120
So you have a couple other bits of evidence to there's some discussion in IRC channel about working on a fairly large change

213
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:36,000
Interesting could you define the term OFONO for me? What is that? What is OFONO?

214
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,880
Ofono, it's the radio stack that we use for doing like

215
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:47,000
It's what it's part of the radio stack, you know, think of it like network manager and all that stuff

216
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,600
So they they're working on a fairly large OFONO change at the moment for a new handsets as an IRC

217
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,800
We're expecting to land and land a new version of OFONO soon. Oh

218
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:02,000
What could it be a new device is expected all of a sudden code name Midori

219
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,920
hmm Noah

220
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:12,000
Noah I think where there is fire and there is smoke. There is an Ubuntu phone. What do you think? I

221
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,860
think you might be onto something the

222
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:22,800
Every time I see the Ubuntu phone in person I am I tell myself I'm like, this is perfect. I want this

223
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,440
Did you know action itself? Did you yeah. Well, so Michael Hall that's his exclusive phone, right?

224
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:32,040
So that like and we took him they so canonical ship them a computer for their demo

225
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:36,640
But they may or may not have forgotten the euro cord that goes in the back of it. You're old card, dude

226
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:42,760
really power cord partner so they we had to go to a store to go get a power cord and

227
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,560
We and so we're I was in the car and I was I was talking with him and I was like man

228
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:51,480
You really use that all the time. He's like, yeah, it's you know, it's a great experience. You're like, let's be clear

229
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:56,260
You're like no, you're in the car with Michael Hall driving to a collection store. You're like, holy crap

230
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:02,420
You're you're not shitting me. You actually use Ubuntu touch. That's your reaction. You actually are using that thing

231
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:06,700
You didn't pull out an Android device when we go to find electronic store. That was your reaction

232
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:13,380
So I just to me I just have a problem and I think you're in the same boat of like using

233
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:18,020
The same using a phone that doesn't have the the available apps

234
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:24,940
But you know and they have the necessary ones right they have like a terminal in an email client and telegram and stuff like telegram

235
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,140
And telegram but um, but you know, there's a couple things that are missing

236
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,860
And so I guess I was a little surprised that that was his exclusive phone

237
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,020
But it seems with a couple of exceptions seems to work very very way

238
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:38,340
Are you saying that there wasn't a maps program on the phone there? Well, yeah, you know, so he doesn't have GPS

239
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:43,940
So I was doing oh, oh the phone doesn't have GPS. Well, I think the phone does it it does

240
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:48,020
He happened about he happened to have a broken one. Oh, that's that's a bit of a bummer

241
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:55,020
So so so in any case so there were there's like there's like little pitfalls the thing though when I get back though is I

242
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:59,700
Just have such a hard time to actually make the leap like when I'm sitting here and I'm using my s6

243
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,660
And I'm not a huge Android family. I don't particularly like Android

244
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:06,660
I just don't know that I dislike it enough to go to a completely different

245
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:10,540
Hmm a completely different system and it's I was looking through you know

246
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:14,260
Like even small things like, you know, we switched over to OS ticket for all to speed now

247
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:19,740
I'm not gonna have an app for that and I use that daily, you know to upgrade update work orders and get push notifications

248
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,460
When new ones come in and and all that dare Devon, what do you fall down on this particular issue?

249
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:31,940
For me, I think it will happen and the transition in the same way transition happened for me in Windows like windows

250
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,740
Yeah, that's when I transition from Windows to full-time Linux

251
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:41,100
I was like this decision of like I'm not gonna care just gonna deal with all the circumstances that show up as they show up

252
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:46,580
Because I believe in it. So I want to see where it goes and be supportive. Well, that's usually no one's line. I

253
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:51,380
Did that and I don't regret it and in the phone

254
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:55,140
I think it will happen that I've been saying that I'd like a convergence thing

255
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:59,300
But you know, I think when I do the jumping will be something like that

256
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:03,940
I'll just drop my phone and say whatever if it's not there. I'll work on getting it there

257
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,140
You know what? I think I need I guess what I need is I need a me in the mobile space

258
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:14,220
I need somebody to come along walk alongside me and and solve my problems so that I'm not so and and hold my hand

259
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,220
So I'm not scared. That's what I need. Hmm

260
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,820
poppy how how

261
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:23,580
realistic would it be for someone like me to assume that this might be an

262
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,940
Image for a device that already exists versus a brand new device

263
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:33,660
So this was reported on OMG Ubuntu, I think there was a photo of the device as well

264
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,660
There's been a couple of photos

265
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:40,500
I've seen a couple of myself. Yes. Yeah, one of them was a bit pixelated and the other one

266
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,900
I think is a bit clearer

267
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:47,900
But they show convergence in full effect and they show it docked to like in one case it shows a docked in there and you

268
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,300
See that you see the unity 8 session up on the screen

269
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:55,300
But when you mentioned the image, it's pretty much the same image on every device

270
00:20:55,300 --> 00:21:02,620
So when you know some new features enable it's enabled for everyone unless it's like hardware specific like a fingerprint reader or something

271
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,820
Then it you know, everyone gets it

272
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:11,620
So if there's new software which fixes bugs in network manager or something that fixes bugs in the radio or GPS

273
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:16,020
Then everyone gets the fixes on all the devices. You want to do you want to playstation 4 poppy?

274
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,060
No, I'm

275
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:24,260
PC gamer PC master races. I just wonder because I just saw this leaked photo with the ps4 and I just wonder where it came from

276
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,740
That's that's you know when you're compiling something

277
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:34,300
I think that's that's a you know, when you're compiling stuff you like turn to the screen next to you

278
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,820
I really I find it to be exciting that

279
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:43,980
There's a possibility that there's such a new there's a new device already because I feel like we just got the pro

280
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:48,820
The muaz or whatever you say it pro, which was a brand new would seem like a really nice high-end phone

281
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,580
Meizu, thank you. Yep. And so here we are just

282
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,980
It feels like Mobile World Congress was just a couple of weeks ago

283
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:00,460
And we already are hearing possibly rumors about a new phone plus last week. We talked about the one plus three

284
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:05,340
Getting a community around it to get a bunch of touch running on that which is an extremely well-reviewed phone

285
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,540
So perhaps it is finally

286
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:15,220
Happening as the Ron Paul meme says speaking of mobile. Let's talk about ting. That's right. That's right

287
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:21,940
Go to linux.com and learn more about ting ting is a mobile service provider my mobile service provider

288
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:28,100
No is mobile service provider. It's just mobile that makes sense. It's only pay for what you use mobile with no contract

289
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:33,120
$6 for the phone line and then just your usage on top of that. It's super straightforward

290
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:37,660
Super super crazy simple no gimmicks. No like on Tuesdays

291
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:43,380
You're gonna get this and over the weekends you can do this and if you don't use this well rolled into this but only for this

292
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:49,220
Amount of time like it's ridiculous or you want to you want to do hotspot or tethering you have to call in and enable that

293
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:53,940
Like that kind of stuff is the 90s. It's done. It's over with and what's nice about ting

294
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:58,500
Is they have two networks to pick from CDMA and GSM and all the devices are unlocked

295
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,380
So if you're like crazy Noah, and you're traveling to Tokyo

296
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,940
You can take your everyday driver phone and just pop a new sim in there. It's no big deal

297
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:12,040
Or like sometimes, you know like needles Noah and I will swap phones because we're not hardcore junkies

298
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:16,380
We're hardcore phone nerds and we swap phones and it's just pop the sim and pop the sim out

299
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:22,020
It's true. Like we and and legitimately the when Noah travels to the jb1 studios

300
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:26,820
He usually brings a tink sim with him true or not Noah. You know, I travel I travel everywhere with one

301
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,820
And I actually I made this guide actually

302
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:35,780
How to I'll have to get it to you I I stole it from from the the the ting website

303
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:42,240
But I went through and I started identifying different like ideal phone specifications and which models

304
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,320
So nice. Yeah specific which models you can buy so that when people ask they say I want the XYZ

305
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:47,960
I can say well

306
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,040
This is the specific model for that phone that you want right that would work with with ting or whatever in that

307
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,160
That that's been really neat because if you buy one that has all of the the I think there are

308
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,480
Five bands that you're looking for for LT if you buy one of those phones with five with all five bands

309
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,000
It will work not only on ting but again if you're roaming abroad into Europe or in Japan

310
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,920
So I just you know and you can buy a prepaid sim in almost any country stick it in and then you have a local number

311
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,640
Yeah, like a local. Yeah, and you know

312
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,240
It's getting way more common to have all of the bands just built into the phones, especially the most recent phones

313
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,480
That's just sort of what the chipset brings now. So that's making it easier

314
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,480
But so ting has a CDMA and GSM network and so we're like with the Nexus devices

315
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,840
You can have either or it depends on your phone and what its capabilities are

316
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,360
But if you understand that there's a thing called GSM and there's a thing called CDMA

317
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,720
You're pretty much good to go ting is gonna really help you out

318
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:39,080
They have great customer service so you get to speak to a human being they have a dashboard that makes managing all of this crazy

319
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:43,680
Easy, they have a store online where you can get things from feature phones. I started like 60 50 bucks

320
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,800
Just I mean imagine that you need a backup line

321
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:51,680
We can just make phone calls and you only pay for when you use it get a $50 feature phone and put it

322
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:56,040
You know just put it on ting or go all the way up and get yourself a full-fledged computing device

323
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,680
That's unlocked and you own it outright. I

324
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:05,640
Personally as much as I can I am advocating for the Nexus ting combo or iPhone ting combo. I think

325
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,480
having been back on Android for a few weeks now since Linux fest and

326
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:17,480
And sort of now getting an appreciation for those monthly updates from Google it makes Android to me a much more palatable

327
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,240
much more secure much more like feels

328
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,800
Much more in line with my priorities from my room a really important computing device

329
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:31,360
You know something that's getting security updates directly from the vendor and ting never gets in the way of that process

330
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,860
They don't have an agenda. They don't have to like brand the update before it gets out there

331
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:41,120
So when you get a Nexus device from the Play Store and you bring it over to ting a couple of really amazing things happen

332
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,460
First of all when you go to Linux not ting comm your first month is gonna probably be paid for

333
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,680
Because average ting bills like 23 24 bucks for a line

334
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:55,400
So you go to Linux not ting comm you get your first month paid for you bring the device on there you pick GSM or CDMA

335
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:59,880
What's ever stronger in your area because the Nexus devices are doing all of it once you get it online put it on Wi-Fi

336
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:04,720
Get all your updates get all your applications installed and then just sit back and enjoy the savings

337
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,720
It's it's such a great combination

338
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,360
Even if you're from outside the US and you're just visiting the states for a little while

339
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:18,720
Bring go go on eBay get a cheap GSM phone put it on the ting network and that travel account

340
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:23,840
They're traveling from the outside outside the US a lot of phones abroad have two SIM slots. Yeah, I know

341
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,880
Yeah, just bring a phone. There's

342
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:32,120
It and it's so simple because at the end of the day you have the safety net of the ting support where they're actual geeks

343
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,840
That love this stuff and they're willing to engage with you

344
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:40,000
So you actually have really great support to go to check them out at Linux not ting comm

345
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:43,240
Also, if you want to just support the show by visiting that page go read their blog

346
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:48,280
They got a new post on a hundred and thirty over-the-air TV stations coming to us cord cutters

347
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,280
I have not had a chance yet to read this

348
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:56,780
But man does that sound like music to my ears as someone who's probably not gonna be getting cable and it may be

349
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,740
Satellite during the election of things get crazy, but I just for right now

350
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:05,480
I'm trying to do everything over-the-air in lady tubes and that's a blog post. I'm gonna read so go to linux.ting.com

351
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:12,000
Calm. Hey Noah, how about we get super geeky for a second on the show you ready for this? That's great

352
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,880
I love getting super geeky in the air. I know you like yourself a VPN and that secure networking

353
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,560
So this is what I am looking forward to it hasn't hit mainline kernel yet

354
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:29,520
But say goodbye soon to open VPN say goodbye to IPSec and say hello to the next generation secure network tunnel

355
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,320
announced for Linux

356
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,320
Jason Donfield is the

357
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,880
Developer and it's called wire guard. It's described as a next-generation secure network tunnel for the Linux kernel

358
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:46,760
It's built into kernel space unlike open VPN which runs in user space and inherently when you're dealing with all this crypto stuff and networking

359
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:52,740
Stuff we're running in user space and then communicating with the kernel kernel. There's just it's just an inherent disadvantage there

360
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,680
So Dunfield explained to a briefing to for Onyx last week about wire guard

361
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:01,780
He says IPSec is overly complex and impossible to actually use in a secure manner

362
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:06,700
But it's the fastest thing out there for a VPN and secure tunneling open VPN very popular

363
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:14,140
But it's super slow and by virtue of being in user space. It contains a whole buggy SSL x59 x509 stack

364
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:17,380
He says I've started from scratch and written an extremely simple yet powerful

365
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:22,780
Cryptographically secure replacement in around 4,000 lines of code called wire guard

366
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:29,860
It's much simpler than anything before it with peers exchanging short curve 25 519 public keys

367
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:34,180
Just like an SSH secure network interfaces can be added and removed

368
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,520
using the usual IP link and IP address tools and

369
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:43,280
From there. Everything is easily taken care of by the kernel and secure tunnels are made quite simple

370
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:48,460
Not only that but the performance is in fact better than IPSec which is basically a huge accomplishment

371
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:52,400
Now this isn't brand new. He's been working on this for a while

372
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:57,660
It's been detailed at some kernel conferences. So it's not like it just showed up out of nowhere

373
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:03,580
It's using industry standard cryptographic standards and they have a brand new website at a wire guard dot IO

374
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:09,380
Which they say there it aims to be an easy to configure and deploy as as SSH is

375
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:16,260
but gives you a VPN connection made simply by exchanging very simple public keys just like exchanging SSH keys and

376
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,500
All of its transparently handled by wire guard

377
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:27,260
Roaming between IP addresses just like mosh is also supported. There's no need to manage connections be concerned about state

378
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,820
Manage daemons or worry about what's under the hood?

379
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:33,020
very basic but powerful interface

380
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:38,220
This is a whole new way for doing secure networking under Linux. It's not a mainline kernel yet

381
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:44,860
But man does this look super promising. No, I'll start with you. What are your thoughts about kind of just sort of

382
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,940
Wiping the slate clean and starting over with VPN technologies under Linux

383
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:55,780
So anyone who's worked especially in the commercial side of VPN knows what a pain it is to get some stuff set up correctly

384
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,100
but

385
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:01,580
Part of me says that like the last one I did which is just a couple of months ago

386
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:07,700
It was literally as simple as I log to the routers are supporting it. Now. I logged into the router. I checked a box

387
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:15,580
I specified the the DHCP leased space that I wanted the VPN clients to log in with I created credentials and I was done and

388
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,620
That is thanks to the fact that that open VPN is just like

389
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:24,380
Natively supported on like every major, you know device now

390
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:32,380
So on some level I feel like we have already gotten, you know a long ways and we've made a lot of headway and

391
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,380
And things are actually pretty good now, though

392
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:37,380
I do respect and understand the concept of you know

393
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:41,060
It may not be as secure as it could be and I got to tell you Chris

394
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:47,780
Having fought with VPN for almost 10 years in various different forms if we could get to a point where it was as simple as

395
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:54,580
SSH or I can install one package on the on the destination, you know server side one package on the client side, man

396
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:58,780
That's appealing. Yeah. Yeah, I totally agree and you know, I started picturing like

397
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,540
just

398
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,020
essentially

399
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,860
Using these types of links and connections as standard by default

400
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,860
Here's the there is one

401
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:13,300
Major issue the internet is taking with this new technology and I wonder if anyone in the mumble room feels this way

402
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:17,620
One of the big pushbacks coming in right now. Well, there's two

403
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,820
but the big first one I want to talk about is

404
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,460
What about putting something that is network accessible

405
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:32,060
That is essentially a core networking technology like this in kernel space because if there is an exploit against this thing

406
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:38,300
You've just owned the entire kernel. You're now running your exploit now runs with kernel level privileges. You're in

407
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:42,780
Doesn't anybody in the mumble room have any concerns about this? I?

408
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:49,300
Thought for sure somebody would I thought for sure somebody would because that is genuinely I think a legitimate concern

409
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:54,420
The other I think number two issue and the open VPN developers have already raised this one is

410
00:31:55,460 --> 00:32:01,020
Why not just spend this time making over open VPN faster? Why can't we why can't we risk?

411
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:06,660
Take all this energy you guys have and put it in open VPN. What do you think about that? No, I don't think so

412
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:10,380
Yeah, I think that open. So the the the the the thing about

413
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:15,500
Starting over right is it I think to some degree it suffers from the not invented here syndrome

414
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:20,300
I think it's it's it's you know, you get these people that say well I could do this better

415
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,860
I could restart from scratch and I think that then you essentially

416
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,380
We're reinventing the wheel on some level on the other hand though

417
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:30,580
Every time I've seen this happen in the past where you take a technology

418
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:36,660
You look look at system D for example, and I know there's probably a sore subject to bring up but you look at system D

419
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:42,100
And look at what has happened and we have taken taken something and completely redone it from scratch and

420
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,860
Everyone kind of said the same thing is oh you're reinventing the wheel

421
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:48,980
There's no reason to do this and I got to tell you we have gone from you know, minutes

422
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:55,220
Minutes of boot time to seconds and if you and if you don't if you're not working in a field where you see that

423
00:32:55,220 --> 00:33:00,500
Then maybe it's not as clear to you. But to me it's there there is there is there should be no discussion about this

424
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:04,660
It was a it was a it's a clear win might have been a little quick on the draw

425
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:09,340
But it is definitely the direction we should be moving. And so if if a new VPN

426
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,140
You know protocol system

427
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:16,540
integrated at the kernel level if we have that same kind of success and that same kind of cleanliness and that same kind of

428
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:20,740
You know increase in performance and security. I'm all for it. Okay. Well, here's his arguments

429
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:25,660
He says, you know, you just can't get the performance in user land applications. It's not that we don't want to support open a VPN

430
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:29,940
It's that open VPN from a performance standpoint is just sort of doomed

431
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:37,220
And he said the developer the other thing about wire guard is this why it's 4,000 lines of code. It's insanely simple

432
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:43,100
It's meant to be the the smallest attack surface as possible. I was on the fence about this until I read

433
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,820
Greg KH's post on Google+. Now. He's not a

434
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:50,140
Networking developer, right? He you know, he focuses on the Linux kernel

435
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:55,420
He were focuses on the LTS branch and on the USB stack and lots of important subsystems the networking subsystem

436
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:59,420
Not one of them, but he writes a new VPN VPN protocol and implementation for Linux

437
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:03,380
It was announced last year at the kernel recipes in Paris. It's great to see a

438
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:08,260
Releasable state at this point. I recommend taking a look at it. If you're into this type of stuff disclosure

439
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:12,340
I have reviewed various versions of the kernel code over the past few months and

440
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,820
It seems safe. So I'm not going to go into that

441
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,580
And it seems sane, but he says note. I'm not a kernel networking developer

442
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:24,460
So Greg says, you know what? It looks like good sane kernel code to me, which is pretty encouraging

443
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:31,740
I mean, I I definitely can't disagree with his opinion on the topic. So I just have one thing

444
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,140
It's a network thing

445
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:39,180
It's about doing this type of but it's in the kernel level when we have to understand what it actually means

446
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:44,000
Being the kernel level also means that a potential flaw on it. Yeah, ten times higher to danger

447
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,080
It's an immediate serious issue. It's an amoeba. It's especially if it's remotely exploitable

448
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,240
Exactly exactly and not only that

449
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:57,760
It's also something that if it's buggy for some reason crashes the entire system too because it's in the kernel. Yeah. Yep

450
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,440
Yeah, so those things should be in mind. Yes, you're not gonna get the performance in the user space

451
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:08,360
But I think it's a good trade-off. Maybe the performance for the security layer. Yeah, I don't know maybe yeah, yeah

452
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,360
I

453
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,000
Think I pretty much agree with your assessment. Okay. All right. Well

454
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:22,300
We have great news today on the unplugged program finally

455
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,600
after years of waiting Linux users our

456
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,480
prayers have been answered

457
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,480
Universal application installation is now available

458
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,400
Thanks to a brand new standard called sub user

459
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:42,260
That's right offering portability security and maintainability for a user application installations on Linux

460
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,320
We have ourselves a brand new

461
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:50,480
Standard called sub user you got your flat packs go screw yourself. You got app images good for you

462
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:56,620
You got snaps you got I don't care because now we got sub users. Are you excited Noah? Come on sub user buddy

463
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,360
Yeah

464
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:07,720
Oh, you know that xkcd comic problem we have 13 community. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

465
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,680
special news correspondent

466
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:18,440
Wes is joining us in the field right now for reporting on this West you are at the launch event for sub user, correct?

467
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,520
Yes, I am. And this is truly the one universal installations

468
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,440
Solution for all Linux users, correct West. Is that what you're learning on the scene?

469
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:33,320
Well, I think doctor was there already and this just makes docker every place else. That's right

470
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:36,560
That's because this is application installation with docker

471
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:43,280
So you take your docker containers and now you use them to distribute all your applications with sub user. That is oh

472
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,200
You like you know what and here's the crazy thing

473
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,920
this

474
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,640
almost could work

475
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:57,480
Because there is just a lot of stink behind docker containers. There's a docker container for everything. It's unbelievable

476
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:02,280
So if you take that and you whittle it down a little bit and you make it as an application delivery platform

477
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,880
You are utilizing the built-in knowledge set of all of these people that have already composed docker containers

478
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:14,080
Which is a lot and it could almost by default just be a way people end up distributing applications

479
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:19,040
At one point though, at what point do we just stop I don't I don't know

480
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:24,200
I just don't know what to do with this anymore. It's too much. It's too much. My head kind of explodes

481
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:28,400
But there you go. It's sub user and you can read more about its docker and

482
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:33,160
Python and a little bit of git combined with a little bit of docker. I

483
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:38,720
Think and to complement this we need to have some universal window managers. Yes, right

484
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,000
Yeah, yeah, gotta make sure you gotta make sure you're doing the right thing

485
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,200
You got to make sure you got to make sure that you got to make sure we get a couple of those though

486
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:50,920
Can't just have one. Yeah, you know, it's amazing. It's amazing how on one side of this argument

487
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:55,480
I started out like two years ago if you'd asked me two years ago what I thought about universal installers

488
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,520
I would have told you that it was the number one problem on Linux and I don't care what anyone said

489
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:06,520
the the number one resistance I think that happens links the reason that people don't port software to Linux the number one reason is

490
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,400
Is there is no universal, you know app installer

491
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,520
It's you gotta figure out which distro navigate that whole mess and now

492
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:19,120
like I'm I've almost gone to the complete other side of it because I'm I just I'm not I

493
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:23,800
Guess I'm not as convinced today that a universal installer could ever work in the Linux ecosystem

494
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,280
I don't know if I don't know if I believe anymore that

495
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:33,560
That it's that it's a viable solution for for the very nature of Linux. Oh girl you crazy

496
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:38,440
I just I I almost don't know how and I know I get so much crap for this

497
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:42,160
But I almost don't know how you can't see it. It's such like out of all of

498
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,240
I'd say it's the number one problem with Linux desktop

499
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:50,440
I agree. I agree, but I don't think it's a solvable problem unless we all agree on one distro to use. I disagree

500
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,480
Well, the whole point of the

501
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,000
Snaps for example is to be on multiple distros

502
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,840
It doesn't matter what district use as long as the top-level application layer is not directly

503
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,840
intertwined into the distro

504
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:09,840
But then don't you have a handicapped version of the application potentially? No, what do you mean?

505
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:17,180
Well, so for example if you have if the if the if the if the arch system for example works

506
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:22,120
You know has is is not capable or works differently than Ubuntu then

507
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:26,260
Isn't the isn't the snap package packaged for the lowest common denominator?

508
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,920
No, it'll all work the same

509
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:35,880
It's just that the current the current reason with the arch thing doesn't work as well as the Ubuntu one is because the Ubuntu

510
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,040
one has been out for

511
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:42,360
Two months and it has been developed before four months and the arch one has been out for well

512
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:47,240
Four days. I'll tell you what. I think here's what kernel Linux is talking about rotten is he saying

513
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,800
The application itself sort of has to assume the lowest common denominator when it comes in the library

514
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,560
So for example when I installed the VLC snap on fedora 24

515
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:03,200
I got a version of VLC that had really really crappy fonts compared to the rest of the fedora 24 desktop

516
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:08,320
Which this is one of the areas they they specifically worked on for this release. And so it seemed like

517
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:14,160
That's probably a early an early problem that's gonna get worked out. But right now

518
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:21,040
That VLC snap doesn't take advantage of the better fonts and better font rendering on my host system

519
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,200
That seems like a bit of a downside, don't you think?

520
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,640
Well, yeah, it'd be kind of annoying. But if there was no one

521
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:33,880
At all putting effort into like a shared library system for snaps that would suck but they're doing that

522
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:38,040
So I'm okay with it. I think it's it's definitely less annoying than not having the application at all

523
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:44,280
Yeah, that's true. That's true. And the other thing and they can also they could just include the font they want

524
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,000
Yeah, that's true. Yeah, that's I wonder about user experience like

525
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,480
Where app image to me feels like it's kind of the easiest from the like Windows user download and run it

526
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,960
I wonder how much we'll see that pushed

527
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:59,480
I think canonical could do it, but it doesn't seem like it's at quite the same level

528
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,720
Yeah, and that will probably determine a lot for the desktop user

529
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,600
It's not even app image is not even that simple for the users

530
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:10,100
It's more simple than an exe or a DMG in general because you you have to be able to do permissions

531
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:14,820
But if as a user of app image you have to know that you have to do that

532
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:20,800
So you have to exp you have to give them information about that you have to you have to set the permissions so that it can

533
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,320
Execute you also have to know how to do that in the first place

534
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:27,800
So there is still you know a stepping stone that you have to go through for app images

535
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,920
that doesn't make it the best whereas in in certain cases the

536
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:38,780
Their goal for snaps is to have just an installer that you would go to the you go to the Ubuntu software

537
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:43,840
App or whatever they're calling it now and then you just install it and there you have it and it's a snap and you're done

538
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,920
We'll be I know you want to try to train people to go to that app

539
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,920
That's the thing that is actually

540
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:53,640
Website and download the snap and it worked the same way or or if the website could somehow

541
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:00,200
Initiate the software centers page. That would be nice to like it's like an apt colon. Yep. Yeah

542
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,800
Yeah, I wouldn't I think you were about to try to jump in there during the crosstalk. So go ahead

543
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:08,940
Yeah, I was just gonna say on the point of that VLC application or rather snap

544
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:14,300
Um with because I've not seen it, but I understand what you're describing the first

545
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:21,900
GUI application that I tried to make with a snap had no fonts whatsoever. The menus didn't render correctly and

546
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:29,900
PNGs didn't render correctly and I fixed all of those problems and it now looks like a themed

547
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,860
Ubuntu Marte

548
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,340
application again

549
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,340
and that took

550
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,060
some changes in

551
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:42,900
snap craft to support that and or rather snap day to support that and

552
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,660
learning

553
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:50,740
How to do this stuff and then that got abstracted away into the way you build snaps. So

554
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:55,260
Don't assume that all applications are going to look like that by default

555
00:42:56,180 --> 00:43:00,540
just take it that somebody has made a VLC snap of a

556
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:06,220
Pre-release version of VLC and they may well still be finding their way. Yeah

557
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:10,640
How to act that was sort of my impression when I used it and I think that you know

558
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:15,020
And when you see that represent itself in a couple of different ways, that's funny people will jump on it

559
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,560
remember when LibreOffice

560
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:21,200
Shipped their first snap and it was way bigger than it needed to be

561
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:23,780
People jumped all over that

562
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:26,540
Yeah, and that's another thing, you know you you have

563
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:32,260
all the debug symbols in there by default at the moment for example, and you know

564
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:39,820
Unless you there are mechanisms to say these are the own bits that I want in the squash FS file system

565
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:43,780
This is the stuff that is the runtime and the executables for example

566
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:47,860
And you can ignore all of these things and the first few times you make a snap

567
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:52,540
you just include everything because you just get the thing to work and then once you've got something that works and

568
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:56,760
Looks right then you can start refining it and actually trimming it down

569
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,360
You know and just as an indication of how early days all this stuff is

570
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:05,420
I ran into an issue during my fedora 24 review where I was trying to install GIMP

571
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:09,300
And it just downloaded an empty repo folder into my home directory. It turns out

572
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:14,900
That was a bug in Flatpak. I was hitting a bug and I didn't realize that I thought I was just doing the commands wrong

573
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:21,040
And I got him I got a note back from our review as bit of feedback saying yeah turns out bug we fixed it now

574
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,720
So it is super early days for all this stuff

575
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:30,920
And it's it so with that when I guess what I'm trying to convey is not only is it early days for the back-end

576
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:35,620
Implementation like the store what its source code is how the packages are delivered

577
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:39,300
But it's also early days for all the people that are packaging the software

578
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,060
And I feel like right now in terms of snaps

579
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:46,840
I feel like we're up against a wall that's about to break and then a whole bunch of snaps are gonna come out

580
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:50,160
But there's not a whole a whole bunch at the moment that you could just jump on

581
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:54,000
You know for the from a dumb user perspective because that's that you know

582
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,280
It was it was kind of a it was kind of an eye-opening experience

583
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,440
I hadn't followed

584
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:04,880
You know the snap packages in the Flatpak and the app image a whole lot prior to obviously until we you know covered it on

585
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:09,000
The show but prior to that I I knew that it existed, but I hadn't really played with it

586
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,120
And so my first foray into it was I went to download our app pic

587
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:17,280
which was the that image burner that Rick I had suggested and it was an app image and

588
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,400
I had no idea how to use it. I just downloaded on the site and double-clicked on it and it installed

589
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,200
I was like, well, that's cool

590
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:26,520
Then I did it on like three other distros and then that really started to click with me and when I went

591
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,680
To install my first snap package

592
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,320
I had no idea how to do that

593
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:34,240
And so I was googling for snap packages found one online downloaded it from the website

594
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,160
Tried to double click on it

595
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:39,600
Like I did with app image and that didn't work and then I googled around a little bit and found that you could do it

596
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,600
From the command line you want to go into or what? Were you on?

597
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,720
Fedora that was yeah, that was about you. Yeah

598
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:49,680
Okay. Okay. Yeah, and and so and and so basically I guess all that to say that

599
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:56,640
If you are a person coming over from macOS or Windows the software installation of app image functions

600
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:01,440
exactly how you would expect it to and you acquire software exactly how you would expect it to and

601
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:07,160
Because it's cross distro. I know you no longer have to worry about training users to search for you know

602
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,560
Look no, look

603
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:17,260
I feel like I feel like I feel like your criticism right there is

604
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:24,580
Temporary I feel like I feel like the next the next the next Ubuntu say the next release even will just they just have to

605
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:30,000
Associate the snap files association with an application that can install okay, but every distro has to do that for that to work

606
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:35,680
No, hang on a minute. Okay, you say that you downloaded an app image and you double clicked on it and it just did stuff

607
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:40,680
It did not. Yes, that is right. Yep. You didn't have to make it executable

608
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,680
Oh

609
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,880
Did I

610
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,680
Yeah

611
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:56,080
That didn't double click them. No, you're right. It's not associated with anything. I had to download it

612
00:46:56,080 --> 00:47:02,080
I had to make it executable and then I could execute it and yeah, you're probably right. See that's that's

613
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:08,680
That it wasn't so we looked at we looked at cha because itches that you know disk

614
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:12,360
Creation utility right that runs on Windows Mac and Linux

615
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:18,520
Rewriting all of our how to make a USB drive

616
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:22,920
Using etcher so that every platform could use one tool

617
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:30,280
But the process of actually installing etcher on Linux is so alien to how people would install things on Linux

618
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:37,080
What we're actually going to do is write the instructions for Windows and Mac to use etcher and then use

619
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:44,800
GNOME disks for Linux because isn't that isn't that now can we just talk about that for a second Wow that you know a distribution

620
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:51,360
Is in the position where it is easier to write how to get it set up under Mac and Windows

621
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:56,440
Than it is under Linux that right there perfectly defines the problem. We are trying to solve

622
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:00,080
We're not I'm not arguing for the replacement of repositories

623
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,360
I'm not calling for the end of Debs and RPMs

624
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:07,960
But that right there is so such a wonderful illustration of the problem

625
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,720
It's that's amazing well, but so I guess

626
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:16,960
So what would be the alternative that we allow by default for applications to?

627
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,360
When you download off the app well

628
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,300
fast forward fast forward five years from now and and let's just say

629
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:28,000
Flatpak snaps or app images have taken off one of them is is so predominant that

630
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:34,120
that you can you can pretty confidently write a how-to and say download this app image and

631
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:40,640
You can almost know with absolute certainty that they've downloaded an app image before and they know how to install it or if it's a snap

632
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:45,280
They know what that's about and so now imagine what wimpy's process would be he'd have the same download page

633
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,840
He'd say here's the instructions for Windows

634
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,220
Here's the instructions for Mac

635
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:49,920
And if you want to do in our Linux

636
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:54,920
download the snap and he could link to the most recent snap or he could link to the you browse page or whatever it is you

637
00:48:54,920 --> 00:49:00,520
apps page and and it would just be double click the snap and follow the instructions when it launches it would literally be a

638
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,600
Less instruction set than it is for Windows

639
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:06,360
I mean, it's a fundamental shift in the friction

640
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:10,600
And it's a fundamental reduction in that friction for users to start with matei I mean

641
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,600
Do you think I'm wrong wimpy or do you think I'm right?

642
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:19,480
No, you are right. We're constantly trying to find ways to make to lower the barriers to entry and

643
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,640
For many reasons

644
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,160
snaps and

645
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:29,720
Universal package installers solve a number of problems. And the thing is is that you've talked about

646
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:35,480
putting snaps on the vendor or you know authors website so people can download a snap and

647
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,840
Install it the same way that Windows users do I?

648
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:48,320
Feel that's a bit of a retrograde step because I think the central repository where you can search for find and install

649
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,640
Applications from one place is the superior

650
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:58,200
Mechanism but snaps support both paradigms. You can have

651
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,160
a snap store or many snap stores

652
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:07,800
Depending on you know, if you've got an iot device that or a nas, you know in the nas vendor wants their own snap store

653
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,040
but

654
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,040
companies like viber for example

655
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:16,280
Could make snaps and have them download off their website

656
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:23,600
So both paradigms are supported with snaps and I think that's um, that's a a particularly useful

657
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,760
useful use case

658
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,160
Do you think it's going to be problematic though for users?

659
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:34,480
If sometimes you obtain it from a central software center and other time I go to that

660
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:39,440
I do and that's why I I would prefer to see that people

661
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,600
Embrace the snap store

662
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:51,480
Paradigm and we keep what we're used to and what mobile phone users and tablet users are used to which is all of your

663
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:58,020
Applications are in a central repository and frankly what macOS and Windows are going to write both have an application

664
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,160
Yeah, yeah

665
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:05,760
So let me so how about this is would there be a way for

666
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:13,280
For for active for somebody to add if you know if the if the snap is on a website is would there be for somebody else to

667
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,560
Take it off their website and add it to the store and then it would the reverse be true

668
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:19,320
Would it be possible for somebody like me?

669
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:26,280
Who really likes to have local copies of things to be able to download those those snap packages and store them on my device?

670
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,520
Yeah, so when I build a snap package, for example

671
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:36,560
I build it locally on my computer and I end up with an architecture specific snap so a an AMD 64 snap

672
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:41,800
and the snap is a squash FS file system that encompasses the application and

673
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:48,200
All of the shared libraries and assets that that application needs to run that snap file

674
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:54,240
You can install by typing snap install path to snap dot snap file

675
00:51:54,240 --> 00:52:01,120
so you can download a snap and install it if you wanted to download all of the snaps in the world and stick them on a

676
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,680
USB hard drive and carry it around with you and

677
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,280
Install from those you could do that

678
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:12,160
And if you have the snap yaml file the snap craft in the file, yeah, if you've got the yaml file

679
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,760
You can build it yourself. Yeah, so dare Devlin

680
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:18,920
What do you think about it being a centralized repository and that being with canonical because don't you think then?

681
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:25,360
that means every single aspect of getting these snaps into the central repository has to be as

682
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:29,040
Easy and simple as possible and I don't think we're there yet. What do you think?

683
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,160
what I think is

684
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:38,040
essentially, I agree with wimpy and that I prefer the model to have a repository and

685
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:45,120
if we want to see the repository still to prevail as the way to install packages what we have essentially to do is

686
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:50,320
just make the process easier for third parties to come and put their package in and

687
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:51,880
Once we do that

688
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:58,240
There's no excuse to why they're not deploying through that mechanism and why are they are distributing, you know?

689
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,640
Through their website instead and perhaps make it easy

690
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:05,360
To make their website put something that you know

691
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:10,680
Like you do in Android you be doing a website in the text that it's an application from the Play Store and opens the Play

692
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,840
Store you might want something that is similar to that

693
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:19,280
That goes and opens your software center and install that so the website will do not actually have a download

694
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,480
But actually something though because the store yes, that's true. Yeah rotten

695
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:29,280
I wanted to give you a chance to jump in and just I was curious your thoughts about the process right now of getting into

696
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,080
That central store

697
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:36,960
Yeah, it's actually very easy. Like wimpy was talking about how he builds the snaps locally. You don't have to do that

698
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:41,160
You can actually just make the yaml file and then send it to the launchpad

699
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:44,680
we'll build it for you through the snap craft tool and create all the

700
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:50,160
architectures snaps that you want and you just push it to the store and if you and if you get

701
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:54,400
You on if you have a if you are a part of a project and you were like the official person

702
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:59,520
You get the namespace of the official project. If you're not you get for example telegram

703
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:07,220
It's telegram dash the name of the guy who did it then so that way you can there's there's no one fighting over namespace

704
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:14,020
So then to get into the store is very simple and as long as your stuff runs and when you know

705
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:16,360
It doesn't break anything. It's all good and you get it in there

706
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:19,640
And then if you have let's say you see a bug and you want to fix it

707
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:24,780
You just do it again through launchpad push it to the store and then the user gets the access to it and gets the update

708
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:29,620
Hmm. Yeah, it actually is so it sounds like the biggest convenience here

709
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:32,300
Sounds like the biggest inconvenience is you have to have a launchpad account

710
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:36,840
I don't know. Yeah, that's about the size of it

711
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:40,780
For some that's a deal-breaker

712
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:44,620
And don't think it's a good thing. It's free and open-source launchpad is yeah

713
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:50,080
And the the Ubuntu snap store implementation is just a snap store

714
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:53,760
Implementation I think others will sprout up

715
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:54,820
Yeah

716
00:54:54,820 --> 00:55:00,620
I I want their own to be only to be one because then if there is more than one there creates more

717
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:05,340
Availability issues, but if there was a structure for example like Ubuntu's

718
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:10,480
Store was like the core base that you could build on top of and have your own snaps

719
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:14,140
But if you don't have a snap for a particular application you got it as like a fallback

720
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:20,100
Yeah, or it could end up like repos where you could have multiples. You could have your local installation of snap

721
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:23,420
Pointed at multiple repos just like you can't a flat pack today

722
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:27,900
Couldn't it could be like that too. It might not be a hard-coded to a single story. Maybe you could have

723
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:32,020
You know, let's say I'm let's say I'm Ubuntu mate. I could have

724
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:35,860
When when my users launched their version of the software center

725
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:40,420
it could be looking at can all of canonicals snap store and a

726
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:43,060
Ubuntu mate snap store that maybe has

727
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:49,220
The the welcome screen in it and maybe a menu launcher and a few other things that you know

728
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:55,580
They've created that to ease the process and it may be it's only four or five things just like today enter gross does

729
00:55:55,580 --> 00:56:02,900
Enter gross does repo priority and you have anti grosses repo at the top and then they have the regular main

730
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:06,520
repos and they they can pull from all the different sources just like a lot of like

731
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:10,900
Like we see today with a lot of derivatives only this would be a snap version and be it

732
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:13,020
It might not have support for it today

733
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:17,220
Snap and snap and local snap do you know that might not have support for multiple stores today?

734
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:21,660
But this is an open source project. I mean in a year it could it could do ten times what it does today

735
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:27,860
Right. It has support for a store like having your own custom store now like, you know

736
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:34,020
So it's only been like two weeks since that was even announced like they were doing the different distro stuff

737
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:37,060
So that's already been proving that they're gonna do other things

738
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:43,120
But there's actually something that a lot of people aren't aware of is that when you have a snap in the store

739
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:47,700
You actually don't just have that snap and that branch you have multiple branches

740
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:52,820
You have the stable branch the unstable branch like the constant testing branch

741
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:57,140
So you can actually have like betas and all this and it's all still one snap that you control

742
00:56:57,140 --> 00:57:00,540
They just can the user can select which branch they want to use

743
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:03,180
So if they want to lay absolute latest they can get it

744
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:10,780
What about licensing issues like for you know, Adobe Reader or you know, they'll be flash or something like that. I

745
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:14,340
Guess more so so more specifically, I guess here's my question

746
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:20,820
The the concern I have about the whole repo idea is you're gonna wind up with I'm afraid that anyway that you're gonna wind up

747
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:26,660
With some distros having certain repos and those repos not being added by default in other distros

748
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:32,480
And so what you wind up with is again certain packages available in one distro and and and not another well

749
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:37,380
But they're all snaps. They're all snaps. You can always just grab the snap right if you know where to but yeah, you're right

750
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:40,780
Yeah, here's what I think though about that for when it comes to licensing and stuff like that

751
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:42,780
I don't know if there's a direct answer because

752
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:50,140
For all we know in six months snap or flat packet have have an option at install where it enables user prompting to accept

753
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:53,780
EULA's and so that I'm not so worried about what wait the point

754
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:55,700
I think you're touching on is if

755
00:57:55,700 --> 00:58:01,400
Something were to happen where you had multiple stores and you had like the chairman's talking about multiple people submit telegram

756
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:05,720
How would you know which telegram is the one that's the most secure most updated most reliable?

757
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:09,180
I think what you would see if that truly existed

758
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:15,080
I think you're gonna like this answer is the market would respond by creating a directory like like GNOME files

759
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:18,300
And like the you app browser that's already created there

760
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:24,580
The open source community will step up and create a platform where you'll have everything indexed. You'll have comments

761
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:29,240
You'll have votes. You'll have just like the AUR or just just like at GNOME files, right?

762
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,340
It'll be that what so I don't use the

763
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:32,860
As much as you do

764
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:33,460
But you know

765
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:40,100
I I go back to the most effective way for me to research products nowadays as I go to Amazon and sort by number of

766
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:42,820
Reviews and if 10,000 people bought something and really liked it

767
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:47,220
I know that I can try and buy the same product and probably a good experience right if we could bring that to software

768
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:49,780
Jeez, man. Yeah, exactly

769
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:52,540
Exactly. I think the market that's just what happened

770
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:57,380
So wimpy I there's something you want to jump in before we wrap up because I didn't talk about this for that long

771
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:59,380
But I wanted to give you the last shout. I

772
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:03,160
Can't remember. Okay, no problem. No problem. You know what? I'll just say this

773
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:08,100
we should probably move on because right now as we record this there is actually a news event happening and we

774
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:13,380
Like I don't even know how long into the show and we haven't even mentioned it if you get to the point where you want

775
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:19,100
To host your own flat packs your app images or your own snap store digital ocean.com use the promo code do

776
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:25,260
Unplugged support this show and get a $10 credit man. Digital ocean is great because it's all KVM

777
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:32,580
So the virtualizer I think I mean just my opinion the best virtualizing platform. I have ever used KVM is the bee's knees

778
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:34,460
They've stacked that on top of SSDs

779
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:40,580
Of course, it's all running on top of Linux 40 gigabit e connections into the hyper visors data centers all over the world and

780
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:45,180
Literally the best interface that could have possibly built sitting on top of the shenanigans

781
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:49,500
I don't know how they do it and the nice thing it's all HTML and even if it was an if they

782
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:54,220
Like if if they had a native app that looked that worked this gotta be like man

783
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:56,580
They got a great desktop app and then they have a functional website

784
00:59:56,580 --> 01:00:00,860
No, it's like better than I would have ever expected even from a native app. It is extremely functional

785
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:05,900
You get HTML 5 console access to your rigs. You can deploy SSH keys to multiple machines at a time

786
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:10,520
You can spin up applications like the entire frequent stack from everything from the you know

787
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:15,660
The kernel of whatever distro you chose all the way up to the final crazy Ruby on rails application

788
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:17,540
You want to run or just the base system?

789
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:22,100
They got data centers in New York, San Francisco, Singapore afternoon, London, Toronto, Germany, India

790
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:29,140
They're growing like crazy and they've matched this great interface that I just freaking love with a super cool

791
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:36,740
API an API that's so straightforward and simple and something they take seriously that a really great community has cropped up and built a ton

792
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:41,440
Of open source code around that speak in a community. They have some of the best documentation out there

793
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:45,060
Literally, even if you're not digital ocean customer, it's still

794
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:49,900
One of the best resources out there check it out because they take that very seriously

795
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:55,440
Which means between the application stacks they have available the base distros they have to choose from and their documentation

796
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:00,600
Experts and beginners can make super super good use out of a digital ocean droplet

797
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:06,360
They also have hourly pricing available because you can spin up and destroy a rig in matter of seconds with snapshots

798
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,040
You can restore and get right back to where you're at

799
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:12,600
It's really nice to take advantage of their hourly pricing and we use our promo code do

800
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:17,360
Unplugged one word lowercase you get the $10 credit that hourly price is gonna last you forever

801
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:22,720
So if you want to experiment with something on a machine that has a crazy great internet connection tons of CPU

802
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:26,000
You want to have multiple people bang on it? You want to put it in production for yourself?

803
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:32,200
If you want something you can access between your work and your home and also on your mobile device and not have to mess

804
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,200
Around and fuss with your crappy router

805
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:39,880
Digital ocean just use the promo code do unplugged and if you ever get to a point where you're ready to put this thing in

806
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:41,000
production

807
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:46,960
It'll work. It'll do it and they make it easy to expand the machines to especially now with a new block storage beta program

808
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,360
You know right now

809
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:53,080
Jupiter broadcasting is taking advantage of digital oceans infrastructure like never before

810
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:58,540
It's so nice to know that when we just want to try a concept we can mess around on digital ocean

811
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:03,720
We don't have to worry about the costs. We know we get great performance and we're ready to go into production

812
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:10,040
We have enterprise grade features like their API like the snapshot capability like the application stack deployments

813
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:12,360
and

814
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:16,760
Go ahead. I'm just gonna say you're slowly moving your studio up to the

815
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:20,720
Cloud it's just a cloud that you can control so that you can get to it from anywhere in your RV

816
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:23,720
I was just I was just gonna say and now with the new team features

817
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,240
I'll just never have to worry about and let Noah do everything. Oh

818
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,320
Digital ocean

819
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,520
Well, that's Rekha's got the post-production work

820
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:35,680
Noah's got the server side work and you know also they make it nice

821
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:39,360
They like if you want to set something up for a client and transfer it to him you can transfer droplets

822
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:44,860
It's a pretty great service digital ocean comm just use the promo code do unplugged in a big. Thanks to digital ocean

823
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:48,420
So I was saying there's a news event going on right now

824
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:53,160
I got a little audio to get you in the mood for those of you that didn't know and I almost I

825
01:02:54,620 --> 01:02:59,420
Considered making it but I would have to mess with the whole road trip plans that I I have right now

826
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:00,380
So I couldn't do it

827
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:05,320
But going on right now is a Red Hat summit or as the Red Hat folks that I've been talking to you call it

828
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:10,480
Summit summit is going on right now, and I got a little audio to put you in the mood

829
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:13,660
Whoa

830
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:18,020
Now no you might I always heard about it. You know you might be a little jealous new to Red Hat

831
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:22,820
I've only been doing it for over a year now my job thought it would be a great idea and a great experience for me

832
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:24,820
to come to Red Hat summit

833
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:26,940
My

834
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:29,860
Excitement here is to learn about a lot of things that I heard this morning

835
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:33,700
12 plus new release announcements. I'm like yes

836
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:40,820
And I'm just looking forward to the next four days. I mean there's so much going on around application development containers

837
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:46,740
Which is part of my world. I think there's a you know opportunity to figure out what's going on all in one place

838
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:52,900
You have a lot of vendors at summit who are in starting to embrace open source in new ways one of the things that we're really

839
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:59,420
Trying to talk about with customers is the fact that we have this cross portfolio experience including services

840
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:05,020
And it's not just product by product and these solutions can really help them solve specific problems all right

841
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:10,180
I was excited. I was stoked until that until that last executive spoke there

842
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:13,820
And then then the entire thing kind of lost me. I don't

843
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:20,660
You didn't hear it. Did you the smurfs is the fact that we have this cross portfolio experience, okay?

844
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:26,820
So one of the things we're trying to communicate to customers that we have this cross part proof a cross portfolio experience, okay?

845
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:31,380
Yeah, including services, and it's not just product by product including services

846
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:38,060
And it's not just product by product and these solutions can really help them solve specific problems

847
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:41,740
But these solutions can really help them solve specific problems

848
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:44,140
I'm gonna play it once in its entirety Noah and then once it's done

849
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:49,860
I want you to tell me what she just said okay trying to talk about with customers is the fact that we have this

850
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:58,020
Cross portfolio experience including services, and it's not just product by product and these solutions can really help them solve specific problems

851
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:02,420
things you just saying that the red hat solutions stretch across a

852
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:10,220
Vast so they partnered with or they're working with Microsoft, and they're and they're working very hard with all of the different problems

853
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:14,860
Here and hired industry experts and have look available

854
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:17,740
All right, so you

855
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:21,940
All right

856
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:26,540
Yeah, okay, okay, okay, so that's what you think all right? No that was a good try. That was a good solid effort

857
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:28,540
We have good. We got nice music. Ooh

858
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:34,340
Yeah, okay, so I mean I'm digging this piece overall wimpy. Could you could you explain to me what she said?

859
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:37,060
Yeah, they've got I'm duck woods

860
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:42,700
You know I that wasn't helpful actually that didn't help Chris

861
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:47,740
You of all people should understand this that poor woman that poor woman is standing there

862
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:49,380
It's dead she's standing there with her computer

863
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:53,860
And she's working on a couple of things and everyone is like tapping her on the shoulder and finally this guy turns around

864
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:54,500
He's like hey

865
01:05:54,500 --> 01:06:00,060
I'm John from the from the from the media marketing department, and we're gonna shoot this thing about we're interviewing people

866
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:03,780
So tell us about red hat and she's and she told him. She's like. I'm not really good on camera

867
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:07,540
I don't you'd be fine. You'd be fine. I don't even really know to you. You'll be fine here

868
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:11,380
We're gonna start rolling okay. Go and then that's what came out. That's definitely a possibility

869
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:15,440
That's totally what happened. I I think I think what it was

870
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:18,940
Now here's what I think it was Noah and picture it okay

871
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:25,980
It's it's two days before the floor opens you finally just got all the banners up the executives are arriving for their pictures

872
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:31,420
Whoa who's getting aggressive in the mumble room daredevil and you were getting aggressive there in the mumble room everybody's arrived for their pictures

873
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:36,820
You haven't actually opened the doors yet, but from a corporate standpoint

874
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:44,620
You have decided what your core message about this entire event is so you get your marketing team there with their eight with their DSLR

875
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:50,700
Camera, and you say summit who are starting to embrace open source in new ways one of the things that we're really trying to talk

876
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:56,620
About with customers is the fact that we have this cross portfolio experience including services

877
01:06:56,620 --> 01:07:01,740
And it's not just product by product and these solutions can really help them solve specific problems

878
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:06,780
What I love about it is she ends with these solutions can help them solve specific problems

879
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:13,740
What what's so what's so corporately wonderful about it is we can help you solve your specific problem after making the most vague

880
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:20,780
Possible with generalized statement we could ever come up with that's what's so amazing about and I really respect Red Hat as a company

881
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:23,060
But when they actually outwardly communicate

882
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:28,820
So they don't they don't actually allow all the cool people in the company to brag and talk about all the neat stuff

883
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:32,980
They're doing and so when they communicate with their Red Hat voice

884
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:36,340
Even their CEO who seems like a pretty great guy

885
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:40,580
Communicates in this style that feels like Microsoft at its clumsiest

886
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:46,260
Yeah, I don't I guess I don't know I guess the problem is you're you're dealing with a couple of things, right?

887
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:51,140
You're dealing with a you're dealing with the most litigious country in the entire world

888
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:53,860
Yeah, that's such a that's such a tired Red Hat excuse

889
01:07:53,860 --> 01:07:58,100
I'm so true when you have a company that big that's worth that much money

890
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:02,260
Yeah, they're walking around with a constant target on their butt meanwhile companies that are

891
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:09,500
Jillions of times larger have their top CEO a top top people sitting down and talking to podcasters by anything the podcaster asks them

892
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:15,540
That's such a tired tried excuse for all of the things that are wrong with Red Hat and fedora. I'm just sick of it

893
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:20,500
I just I guess I guess I would agree with you and you I know for a fact you've been there with me

894
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:25,980
I would agree with you if it wasn't for the fact that we've talked to those people and what they say on camera and what?

895
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:30,820
They're able to say I think I don't think I think there's I think there is a culture problem at Red Hat and I think

896
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:36,580
That the employees absolutely fear all these legal things. I don't think I think they all are the biggest bunch of paranoid

897
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:40,380
People out there. I mean it is ridiculous. I it's given their clientele

898
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:43,580
Do you think it I mean is it is the community involvement or a better presence?

899
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:48,820
Just not in their interest in the long-term fiscal sense. I think giving their clientele. It's expected

900
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:51,660
This is how you communicate so it's part of the reason they communicate this way

901
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:54,580
Yeah, that's that might be part of it

902
01:08:54,580 --> 01:09:00,340
I guess I guess I just every time I every time that we've had somebody on

903
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:07,260
Camera, it seems like they they they follow this the the strict rudimentary procedure and then you get them off-camera and they're geeks

904
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:12,100
Just like you and me and that that just tells me that they have hired legal people that have specifically told them

905
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:13,780
Hey, these are the things that you don't want

906
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:17,940
These are these are the approved things that you say because these are the things that we can get right sure

907
01:09:18,940 --> 01:09:20,940
I feel like that does feel like what they say

908
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:25,500
Why is it that the no other companies like that? No other company?

909
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:32,300
We talked to no other company in the Linux ecosystem has these same concerns other people are worried about these particular issues

910
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:39,340
But nobody is literally petrified the the employees from Red Hat are terrified of this particular issue. Nobody else is like that

911
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:41,340
What's the down?

912
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:47,420
I'd claim that none of them is as big as Red Hat and that's one thing and they have to be risk-takers if they want to

913
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:50,220
Be in the platform discussing when Red Hat is discussing things

914
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:57,020
You know what? I will also claim that they mentioned solutions, which is you know keyword to we provide for everything

915
01:09:57,020 --> 01:10:01,100
But what without committing into any specifics and you come with us you talk with us

916
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:01,580
Yeah

917
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:08,540
We're really trying to talk about with customers is the fact that we have this cross portfolio experience including services

918
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:13,580
And it's not just product by product and these solutions can really help them solve specific problems

919
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:16,300
You know, I've heard that 30 times and I still just doesn't make any sense

920
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:21,740
And I guess it doesn't matter. It's it's just a it's just a part of how they communicate. That's my that's my main point

921
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:24,220
They need some cross vocabulary solutions

922
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:31,500
Maybe they just think which company provides products and always advertises their products and it's their competitor

923
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:36,140
While they're providing solutions and that will be more pleased more pleasant to their customers to hear

924
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:40,220
Yeah, just think about that. Who's that usual canonical for example? Yeah

925
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:44,380
Focus on their products. It's there. What's the downside?

926
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:48,060
Yeah of saying something like that. Like where where is that? Where is it? Where is it problematic?

927
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:52,460
It sounds like disingenuous bullshit by people that don't actually even know the very products

928
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:55,260
They're selling and which makes me have doubt in the people that run the company

929
01:10:57,660 --> 01:10:59,820
But because there's a clear communication style

930
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:04,540
Isn't that doubt alleviated from the from the from from the from the people that do have the expertise

931
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:06,140
No, because they're not the ones making the decisions

932
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:09,580
The people making the decisions don't even know the product

933
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:12,140
Right and they're not listening to that spiel as well

934
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:16,380
Right, and they're not listening to that spiel. Anyway, they don't care the deals are made elsewhere, right?

935
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:22,460
But I feel like the entire culture at red hat is the is the idea that anyone in the company

936
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:27,260
Has the ability to offer input and in there is no top-down hierarchy

937
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:30,620
And that was entire that was the entire purpose of jim whitehurst's book

938
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:35,020
Was that he thought he was going to go into this company and teach them how to run a company from the top down

939
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:37,740
And what it taught him was that that's not the way that a company is run

940
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:43,340
Okay, that's much I mean I just that does sound that's the way pretty much every corporate company

941
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:48,380
Every you know cover integer speaks when you they do any kind of press like why what hurts?

942
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:50,380
What is hurting red hat in this case?

943
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:55,900
Maybe it's because no one listens to what they say because they never say anything. That is exactly it

944
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:59,340
And I don't really I guess I wish we weren't dwelling on this because i'd rather move on

945
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:04,140
But my point is is when you don't speak clearly you don't connect to the to the linux audience

946
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:09,580
You don't connect to the to the linux audience if you have an audience in the open source

947
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:14,540
This is this is a summit for technical people. Okay. This is not a marketing event. This isn't ces

948
01:12:14,860 --> 01:12:17,020
This isn't the this isn't something for consumers

949
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:23,980
This is at the red hat summit for people who are sys admins and people that make their livings on red hat systems, right?

950
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:25,500
So I think I want to be clear

951
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:31,020
This is an introduction to why you as a technical person should come to the summit that was posted on the red hat youtube channel

952
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:37,180
I get I guess that wasn't my impression of of uh of red hat summit. I thought it was for more like high level

953
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:39,020
you know like uh

954
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:41,020
like uh, you know

955
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:45,980
Absolutely, then there's there's all kinds of yeah, there's people vars there and all kinds of stuff and another

956
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:51,180
Another group of people there is microsoft, uh, and they made some huge announcement announcements at red hat summit

957
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:56,540
Which I think is sort of a big news story kind of in on itself is that microsoft is making these announcements at a red

958
01:12:56,540 --> 01:13:02,380
Hat summit the company announced the general availability of dot net core and asp.net core 10 the microsoft announcement

959
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:07,500
uh is kind of a big deal at red hat summit and one of the motivations in open sourcing dot net is

960
01:13:08,540 --> 01:13:13,500
They really want to collaborate more with red hat and red hat has a couple of web pages dedicated on their website now to making

961
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:15,580
red hat the premier dot net platform

962
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:21,420
Uh, the red dot net foundation will be the steward of overall dot net development and red hat just joined that foundation

963
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:23,820
So that's kind of a big deal

964
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:27,500
That's one of the that's an example of some of the folks that are at uh, the summit

965
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:32,940
And it's really microsoft kind of delivering on this this promise of opening dot net and getting it running on linux

966
01:13:33,020 --> 01:13:33,420
Yeah

967
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:39,340
Well, they seem to have some serious motivation because they announced that nearly one in three azure virtual machines are now running linux

968
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:45,100
Microsoft is uh sort of seeing a huge growth because just the same time last year they said one and four

969
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:49,340
So now they've gone in a year at least according to racinovich who runs azure

970
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:53,820
uh, this is microsoft's gone from one and four of its azure virtual machines to one and three

971
01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:56,140
and uh

972
01:13:56,140 --> 01:14:00,460
The other the other uh, two-thirds are just azure customers running windows servers and virtual machines

973
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:04,540
So they're they're seeing a big uptick for linux at azure and you know

974
01:14:05,420 --> 01:14:09,340
It's one of the reasons linux academy has launched azure training is it's just big over there

975
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:11,820
So yeah

976
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:14,380
That's a big. I don't know guys to me that seems like uh

977
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:19,340
It seems like the microsoft stuff changes how I think about it a little bit like I wouldn't previously like if I was going to

978
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:24,220
Make a project. I wasn't going to start it on dot net and maybe java if I want like a nice object oriented garbage collective

979
01:14:24,220 --> 01:14:25,020
Etc

980
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:28,860
But if they're going to have first class linux support and you know really stand behind like that then

981
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:31,020
I mean they don't they make some good software

982
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:35,740
They have a lot of talented engineers there if they're really down with the openness, then maybe it's something to be worthwhile

983
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:42,060
So I just looked at the registration at 1600 bucks, uh for the for the full pass to go there

984
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:48,220
So it and to me this seems like a this seems like the oscon and the linux con of conferences

985
01:14:48,380 --> 01:14:49,900
Except it based more on linux

986
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:57,260
And so in that regard, I don't know that I don't know that highly technical down to earth, you know unfiltered

987
01:14:57,580 --> 01:15:01,420
You know technical talk is is necessarily the most appropriate to marketing video

988
01:15:02,220 --> 01:15:06,540
Dude, you are really just all in with red hat. Well, I just I just I just I really am

989
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:11,260
You know, i'm not I guess i'm just not you're telling me you're telling me

990
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:16,620
I mean, I I feel like this is sort of almost like it doesn't even need explaining but

991
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:20,700
What are what are the number who are the number one attendees of oscon?

992
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:26,860
You know, we've talked to a lot of a lot of big business people that could care less about no those are the vars

993
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:28,300
Those are the people at the booths

994
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:34,620
The attendees are our sys admins and dev guys who are sent there by their company because their company's paying for the ticket

995
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:39,260
That's the people walking around the floor. Those are the people attending the talks. That's I mean, come on

996
01:15:39,260 --> 01:15:41,900
Those are the people filling up those rooms listening to the talks

997
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:46,700
I I I I guess I I guess I don't I guess you're right there

998
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:53,020
I mean, there's definitely a large majority of those but there's also a healthy there's also a healthy majority of

999
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:55,420
people that are you know that are

1000
01:15:55,420 --> 01:16:01,660
That are just you know decision makers just you know executive types that are there to learn about their technology, too

1001
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:05,420
They're not actually the ones implementing that stuff the low level developer kind of people

1002
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:10,700
Uh, but I you're right. I mean we walked into that. There's a whole group of people that were that we talked to

1003
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:14,060
Was at oscon, I think and all of them, uh, you know

1004
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:17,420
I think the funnier thing is that you're bringing it back up after we moved on

1005
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:21,100
I just I went and looked at their website and I was like, all right

1006
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:27,980
A little bit i'm looking at the keynote speakers and i'm looking there's a guy from target. There's a guy from uh, from from uh, intel

1007
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:29,340
There's a guy from dell

1008
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:35,420
It just it it very much feels like a very corporatey conference and it seems like corporatey speak is appropriate there

1009
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:37,260
So what do you think about what do you think about?

1010
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:43,580
Uh red hat enterprise being the premier platform to build dot net on a proven and trusted enterprise linux

1011
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:49,500
Dot net on red hat enterprise linux gets started right now if you go to developers dot red hat dot com slash dot net

1012
01:16:49,820 --> 01:16:51,660
What are you excited noah?

1013
01:16:51,660 --> 01:16:57,260
I am excited that a company like microsoft is going to have the incredible influence of red hat over them

1014
01:16:57,260 --> 01:16:59,260
To help them push them in the right direction

1015
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:05,980
Uh, well, that's a very political way to say that that is very nice. Very nice. Um,

1016
01:17:08,060 --> 01:17:12,700
Are you okay if we move on or do we do we do we gotta hug it out if we gotta hug it out

1017
01:17:13,740 --> 01:17:17,740
No, we're good. I mean because you know, I know I know you don't like it when we talk bad about your red hat

1018
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:24,300
No, no, it's okay. Just they they red hat is why i'm on linux is because they made such an amazing product

1019
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:25,820
Ha ha

1020
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:27,740
All right. Well

1021
01:17:27,740 --> 01:17:31,580
Speaking of running linux. I have been running linux mint 18

1022
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:34,300
And I gotta tell you

1023
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:35,580
It's not so bad

1024
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:37,580
Uh by the time you're probably getting this down

1025
01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:44,860
Listen, if you're a download audience member linux 8 linux mint 18 cinnamon and mate additions will likely be released softpedia

1026
01:17:45,180 --> 01:17:49,500
Noticed it a little earlier. Thanks to a tipster. They have links to the iso downloads which are in our show notes

1027
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:52,460
And this is as of june 28th

1028
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:54,300
um now

1029
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:58,860
This is the uh, this is the new version after a lot of talk about xapps and all of that kind of stuff

1030
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:04,780
It has the new of cinnamon 3.0 goodness in it that probably a lot of you have been anticipating if you're a cinnamon user

1031
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:06,940
And this release is going to be supported until

1032
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:09,180
2021

1033
01:18:09,180 --> 01:18:14,480
So this is something that'll be around for a while. In fact, it'll be the base of future releases until 2018

1034
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:17,340
So like I was mentioning this has the new xapps in it

1035
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:22,940
Which I had a chance to try out a little bit. It has high dpi support. Well, he's much improved high dpi support

1036
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:24,300
um

1037
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:26,300
Has the uh, it has the brand new

1038
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:31,740
Info screen when you launch the update manager for the first time that gives you a little bit more clarification about the different

1039
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:34,620
upgrade options

1040
01:18:35,260 --> 01:18:37,260
What is there's somebody like

1041
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:41,340
There is somebody there is somebody going on with the jacksaw in the back. I don't know what's going on out there

1042
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:47,500
Uh, and uh, it's got uh, I the new theme that is based on arc and the mocha icon theme

1043
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:50,300
uh the mint y theme which actually

1044
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:53,100
When you put it in dark mode looks, uh

1045
01:18:53,740 --> 01:18:59,340
It looks pretty nice. It looks uh, pretty nice. So this is the new mint 18 sort of at a very high level

1046
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:01,180
I've only been using it for like um

1047
01:19:01,180 --> 01:19:03,920
Three hours, so I only have very very first impressions

1048
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:05,580
I did hit a few bumps

1049
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:07,980
So I want to give you guys a few warnings and things like that

1050
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:12,620
Anybody in the mumble room had a chance to try any of the betas of mint 18 or been looking at it as the release

1051
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:14,460
Has been getting closer

1052
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:19,420
I've been doing competitive research. Yes. Oh, really? And what is your uh, reconnaissance, uh showing you?

1053
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:22,540
Uh, it's linux mint

1054
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:27,100
Same stuff but newer

1055
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:29,180
so, um

1056
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:33,020
That was sort of my impression too and I was actually kind of hoping you would have more because I didn't have much

1057
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:37,580
That's kind of oh my god. Sorry. Sorry for stealing your wind. Yeah, you did

1058
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:41,420
And my wind was not much. I had very little wind, uh, which is not normal right now

1059
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:45,740
I think right now like what we were talking about at least we're talking about like 17 71, etc

1060
01:19:46,460 --> 01:19:47,340
I think

1061
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:48,940
We kind of know what linux mint is

1062
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:52,620
And where they really shined in the past was on some of that polish and integration

1063
01:19:52,780 --> 01:19:55,420
And it's kind of hard to assess that this close after release, right?

1064
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:59,420
So maybe in a week or two we can see really are they excelling at what they're trying to do or not?

1065
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:04,700
Yeah, I actually think wait a week or two would be good advice because uh, so I decided to put this on the libram

1066
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:09,100
Which is as you guys are probably well aware a laptop built to run linux

1067
01:20:09,740 --> 01:20:11,100
No, did you know that?

1068
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:15,580
What are you laughing about? It's a laptop built to run linux. What's the problem? What's undoubtedly about to leave your mouth?

1069
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:20,860
So, uh the linux mint, uh first pass on the install, uh wouldn't work

1070
01:20:21,340 --> 01:20:27,260
Uh, it warned me about some uefi issue. Uh, basically that I had another os on there and that uh,

1071
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:33,500
Yeah, there's some shenanigans where to occur with a with a bios simulation that I may not be able to boot into their os

1072
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:37,660
Is to which I said the entire reason i'm installing mint is to not boot into those other os

1073
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:41,820
So go ahead and nuke and pave. All right, so I figured this problem solved. Oh, no

1074
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:45,020
What you didn't switch the hard drive, did you?

1075
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:46,300
No

1076
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:49,820
Okay, so we just blew away our obs. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah

1077
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:54,220
Yeah, and and I realized that and I realized it doesn't boot. It's just so

1078
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:57,420
Good at all. So that's good. So that's sweet

1079
01:20:57,500 --> 01:21:02,380
And then I did manage to get it to boot but uh, I don't know why but my wi-fi is not working

1080
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:06,780
And I haven't and that's kind of so I just ended up using ethernet, uh usb adapter to play around because

1081
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:09,260
I didn't have time to troubleshoot the wi-fi at the moment

1082
01:21:09,980 --> 01:21:14,140
I did notice the settings control panel is also a little cleaned up and there's uh, there's the you know

1083
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:20,140
There the overall uh, the new theme and all that and the new version of uh, sentiment is really nice

1084
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:22,380
It's a really nice stuff to click yet

1085
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:28,780
So I tried to figure that out for you because I thought you might ask me that and they've removed the mouse and trackpad

1086
01:21:28,780 --> 01:21:32,780
Uh control panel applet from the settings thing now you might

1087
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:35,500
Some stuff you can still search for like so for example

1088
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:37,740
If you wanted to search for uh proprietary drivers

1089
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:42,620
You don't you no longer can find like the drivers or software sources entry in the settings

1090
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:45,260
But if you search for it in your mint menu, it will come up

1091
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:48,540
Ah, that's good that that makes a lot of sense. I'm glad to hear that

1092
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:53,500
So yeah, it looks like I was gonna ask if we can enable touch to click. Yeah, right. I know I know no not no

1093
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:58,380
No, not no, I hate apps to click. I don't just and I don't mean like click during the show. No, uh,

1094
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:00,700
quietly click

1095
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:07,580
Here's your the thing is I actually not only I don't just like kind of dislike it. I actively like I can't stand it

1096
01:22:08,780 --> 01:22:10,860
I can't stand I can't even use a computer if it has to happen

1097
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:15,500
He gets super grumpy west and then if it's like one in the morning, he gets like all diva about it. It's bad

1098
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:18,700
It's real bad. We don't want that and you could ask rikai

1099
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:26,060
My son dylan was over here at the house last night at the studio and uh, he was going on a rant about track pads

1100
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:32,460
And then him and rikai started labeling me as a track pad as a track pad supporter as a tracks

1101
01:22:32,620 --> 01:22:36,620
I know it got it started getting heated in my own studio over track pads

1102
01:22:36,940 --> 01:22:40,540
So I you know, and i'm just i'm just a track pad indifference. That's all I don't like them

1103
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:44,220
But I don't dislike them that much and I started I started taking a lot of track bad heat

1104
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:49,260
So no, you are you are leading a revolution, you know, who else is leading a revolution?

1105
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:51,260
That'd be red hat in their communication

1106
01:22:51,260 --> 01:22:56,060
Is one of the things that we're really trying to talk about with customers is the fact that we have this

1107
01:22:56,360 --> 01:23:04,140
Cross-portfolio experience including services and it's not just product by product and solutions can really help them solve specific problems

1108
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:06,620
Yeah

1109
01:23:06,620 --> 01:23:11,180
Uh track bad works under fedor just saying oh good. Yeah. Yeah the new lib input, huh? Yeah, that is nice

1110
01:23:11,180 --> 01:23:15,340
I can go ahead and disable tactically. That's it's fantastic. You know the first time we used the new fedora 24

1111
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:18,620
There was like 20 seconds where the mouse felt really weird

1112
01:23:19,580 --> 01:23:23,820
And then yeah, go ahead. Are you looking for are you looking for cross cursor solutions?

1113
01:23:26,540 --> 01:23:31,580
Yeah, could you have any specifics because uh, I wonder if you don't have it from any specific division maybe as a service

1114
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:36,060
All right. So this is yeah, can't you tell this is my last lup for a week? Yeah, I know right

1115
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:42,860
All right before we get into these desktop killers that wimpy and I have been drooling over and I think noah

1116
01:23:42,860 --> 01:23:47,420
You're perfectly suited as a orx pro owner and as somebody who also has the 13 inch side of this

1117
01:23:47,660 --> 01:23:54,220
we're going to talk about um, is linux technically dead on the desktop not because of linux itself, but because

1118
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:57,580
Just statistically speaking in 10 years five years

1119
01:23:59,420 --> 01:24:01,740
Is is the desktop really going to be necessary

1120
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:07,020
We have a couple of new products out in the market that are just unbelievably powerful and they're portable

1121
01:24:07,420 --> 01:24:09,580
I I can't even as somebody who works in video production

1122
01:24:09,580 --> 01:24:11,340
I can't even believe i'm about to ask this question

1123
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:13,980
But realistically I gotta look at I gotta look at the specs

1124
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:19,100
I gotta look at the sales stats and I gotta ask the question. So before we go there, let's go somewhere nice

1125
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:24,780
Let's go to this new. Oh, there it is. There's the one just on time. There's that weed whacker good

1126
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:30,860
This is uh, we're then we've added that weed whacker in post. We sweetened up the linux academy spot

1127
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:34,060
We wanted to make sure you know what else and then we add a few other things like we brought in bill hammer from

1128
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:36,140
Our himmer from uh, fox news

1129
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:41,340
See there's bill so that's nice and megan kelly's here too to help us omg omg omg

1130
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:45,500
I don't know why I don't know why but we also have a little background music for linux academy

1131
01:24:45,820 --> 01:24:47,820
That's right. Go over to linuxacademy.com

1132
01:24:47,980 --> 01:24:51,500
Unplugged friends and look at that new site. Oh, look at that site

1133

Look at that thing. They they I tell you what

1135
01:24:57,420 --> 01:25:02,140
They ain't stopping over at linux academy. They're adding new content all the time

1136
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:07,740
They've expanded their staff to make sure the old stuff stays relevant. It's linux enthusiasts

1137
01:25:08,700 --> 01:25:10,700
trainers developers

1138
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:14,720
Educators they've came together. They created a linux academy platform and you can get started at linuxacademy.com

1139
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:17,580
Unplugged you get a great discount

1140
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:19,100
They have hands-on labs

1141
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:22,220
So you get to work with this stuff instructor mentoring when you need to talk to humans

1142
01:25:22,220 --> 01:25:26,940
Video courses with self-paced in-depth courses. We can download comprehensive study guide

1143
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:31,340
The courseware automatically adjusts to the distribution you want to use

1144
01:25:32,860 --> 01:25:34,620
Learning plans

1145
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:36,120
learning paths

1146
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:42,300
Availability planners all of these things help you structure a learning plan when you don't have a lot of time. So if you get busy

1147
01:25:42,940 --> 01:25:45,500
Going on a road trip those kinds of things you're going to tokyo

1148
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:51,740
Linux academy's got your back. I like that too for the this is like when you're just

1149
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:57,260
You only got an hour. They got nuggets deep dives. They have ios and android applications

1150
01:25:57,340 --> 01:25:59,500
They have note cards that can be forked to help you study

1151
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:02,300
And they have a super active community packed

1152
01:26:04,140 --> 01:26:06,140
Full of jupiter broadcasting members

1153
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:10,460
Or if you have 13 hours of free wi-fi on an airplane over to tokyo

1154
01:26:11,260 --> 01:26:12,300
then

1155
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:14,140
You can continue to learn

1156
01:26:14,140 --> 01:26:19,500
While lounging about on an airplane. I like that in business class too at that you swath son of a gun

1157
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:24,160
That's right getting your getting your knowledge on at linuxacademy.com

1158
01:26:25,660 --> 01:26:27,660
Go check them out. They're growing like crazy

1159
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:30,380
It's a really great platform committed

To expanding linux all of the technologies linux core technologies and also the technologies built

1161
01:26:36,380 --> 01:26:38,380
On top of linux academy go there now

1162
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:40,700
Because time my friends

1163
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:42,700
Is running out

1164
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:44,540
Linux academy.com

1165
01:26:44,540 --> 01:26:47,980
Unplugged and a big thank you to linux academy for sponsoring the unplugged program

1166
01:26:48,460 --> 01:26:53,500
And thank you to that weed whacker for adding a little bit of extra context to that spot a little extra buzz

1167
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:58,860
Yeah, you know a little bit of layers a little bit of flavor. So, uh, there's this guy named martin wimpress

1168
01:26:58,940 --> 01:27:00,380
Uh, I don't know who he is

1169
01:27:00,380 --> 01:27:02,540
But he's got a lot of nerve teasing me like this

1170
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:08,780
This son of a gun over here posts that intro where will soon be announcing a new laptop that he had the privilege of naming

1171
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:11,020
the entry where athena

1172
01:27:11,020 --> 01:27:12,860
Well wimpy that sounds pretty cool

1173
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:17,260
Tell me about the process of naming a computer and maybe a little bit of backstory here about the athena

1174
01:27:17,420 --> 01:27:19,420
And then the big reveal if you will

1175
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:23,980
Okay, so I obviously have a relationship with intro where um

1176
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:29,740
And i've known that they've been working on this computer for some months now

1177
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:33,660
And as it was getting close it had like a code name

1178
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:39,740
Uh, and we were exchanging details using the code name and uh, and then they sort of said oh

1179
01:27:39,740 --> 01:27:41,740
We're going to call it this

1180
01:27:41,740 --> 01:27:44,940
And I was like, oh, okay. I said, oh, uh

1181
01:27:46,220 --> 01:27:49,020
Oh, we're thinking of calling it this and I was like, oh

1182
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:54,940
I'd like uh coming up with a name. So I came up with the the name athena which they liked so

1183
01:27:55,660 --> 01:27:57,660
It's the intro where athena

1184
01:27:57,900 --> 01:28:04,620
That is pretty an athena. What is there any special revelance or uh connection to the name? Well, um

1185
01:28:04,620 --> 01:28:09,180
Um, all of their machines are named after greek gods and goddesses

1186
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:14,780
uh, um, and I like the classics and athena I think is the uh,

1187
01:28:15,580 --> 01:28:17,020
the uh

1188
01:28:17,020 --> 01:28:18,540
most interesting

1189
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:23,580
Uh of the goddesses. So she's the goddess of war and peace

1190
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:28,780
and wisdom and craft and uh, all sorts of things so she's uh, she's

1191
01:28:29,740 --> 01:28:31,740
Got more attributes than any of the others

1192
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:37,020
So, uh, this is a pretty well-specced machine and depending on your different options

1193
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:39,020
It could be a powerhouse now

1194
01:28:39,020 --> 01:28:44,540
I I happened to a little birdie told me that you may have ended up purchasing one of these athenas

1195
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:50,060
So you must have had it for at least a bit wimpy. How is it? How is the machine?

1196
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:54,620
Why did you decide to purchase it? What are your experiences like tell us all about it?

1197
01:28:55,420 --> 01:28:58,300
So I have sold every computer I own

1198
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:02,220
My own in order in order to make some money to buy this

1199
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:06,860
So once I knew this was on its way i've been ebaying my com my computers

1200
01:29:07,820 --> 01:29:09,820
and um

1201
01:29:10,300 --> 01:29:16,140
Uh, i've also I don't if remember a few weeks ago. There was a sharp uptick in uh, the bitcoin price

1202
01:29:16,220 --> 01:29:22,140
It went up about 20. Oh, yeah, I did notice that as a matter of fact. Yeah. Yeah, so I I I cashed out some coins

1203
01:29:23,020 --> 01:29:27,100
Between you know, and I were playing the bitcoin market for our hardware. Yeah

1204
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:30,380
To uh to uh, sort of cover the balance

1205
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:32,700
so I

1206
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:34,940
uh, i've gone full full metal

1207
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:37,500
intro ware athena, so uh

1208
01:29:37,900 --> 01:29:42,380
The one I have has got the uh skylake i7 6820 hk

1209
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:48,300
Which is a quad core and that can push out a turbo 3.6 gigahertz

1210
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:52,220
64 gigs of ddr4 ram

1211
01:29:52,780 --> 01:29:54,940
all right, um i've got uh

1212
01:29:54,940 --> 01:30:00,060
Uh, i've only installed three of the hard drives at the moment. So i've got three ssds in there at the moment

1213
01:30:00,780 --> 01:30:03,020
a 256 drive which is boot

1214
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:04,780
and two

1215
01:30:04,780 --> 01:30:06,780
one terabyte drives

1216
01:30:09,660 --> 01:30:14,620
And i'll be i'll be adding another one and the reason for the two one terabyte drives one is for

1217
01:30:15,180 --> 01:30:20,940
Uh the home partition and then I also create myself a second logon. That's just called steam

1218
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:24,620
And I mount that second drive on slash home slash steam

1219
01:30:25,100 --> 01:30:31,500
So that all of the games sit in there and then uh as as I reinstall and what have you

1220
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:36,300
I don't have to download all of my stuff. Oh, that's a really smart idea

1221
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:39,980
I put mine all on a drive called slash big and it's just like a pool of drives

1222
01:30:40,620 --> 01:30:45,260
So that's a clever name. Hey speaking of names, uh wimpy. I have I have one question for you

1223
01:30:45,740 --> 01:30:47,740
Did you consider?

1224
01:30:47,740 --> 01:30:49,740
naming the laptop

1225
01:30:49,740 --> 01:30:51,740
laptop mclappy face

1226
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:54,860
No, I didn't

1227
01:30:54,860 --> 01:31:00,620
I spoke about this on the ubuntu podcast and they all pointed out I missed the obvious thing is that I should have called

1228
01:31:00,700 --> 01:31:02,700
it the intro where martin but

1229
01:31:05,180 --> 01:31:07,180
Nobody

1230
01:31:07,980 --> 01:31:09,980
Would have gone for that. Yeah

1231
01:31:10,460 --> 01:31:11,260
Yeah

1232
01:31:11,260 --> 01:31:16,220
So, um, this has got the it's got uh, intel iris 5 30 pro graphics in it

1233
01:31:16,220 --> 01:31:21,020
And it's also got an nvidia gtx 980 m in it as well

1234
01:31:21,740 --> 01:31:23,820
um, so with optimus switching

1235
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:26,380
Oh, and is that working?

1236
01:31:26,460 --> 01:31:31,980
Yeah, well, um, it's you have to log out and log in so I it doesn't do diane on the fly switching

1237
01:31:31,980 --> 01:31:35,020
I I imagine if I messed about with bumblebee I could get that to go

1238
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:41,660
but I usually i'm using the intel graphics the only time I use the nvidia graphics is if

1239
01:31:42,140 --> 01:31:44,700
I want to do uh some game playing or

1240
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:48,940
Or uh, i've just started recently experimenting with the nvank stuff

1241
01:31:49,180 --> 01:31:54,620
But those tend to be specific work cases and i'm quite happy to log out and log back in to handle that

1242
01:31:55,900 --> 01:32:01,100
But I wrote a utility from for marty, um, or rather forked a utility

1243
01:32:02,060 --> 01:32:07,260
And extended it a little bit that um sits in the tray and it shows you which you're using and you can just toggle

1244
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:09,980
And then uh log out log in

1245
01:32:09,980 --> 01:32:15,340
Wow, that is quite the mission. That's a multi-year machine. I can tell you somebody who's bought some workstation killers before

1246
01:32:15,820 --> 01:32:17,820
Yeah, any chances are going to be?

1247
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:20,540
Sorry, any chances are going to be available in the us at some point?

1248
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:27,500
Uh, there are no immediate plans for entroware to ship in the us as far as i'm aware now is this

1249
01:32:28,700 --> 01:32:29,820
Yeah, go ahead

1250
01:32:29,820 --> 01:32:34,060
I do know despite despite the politics in the uk

1251
01:32:34,060 --> 01:32:40,940
Uh last week. I do know entroware are very close to launching in some european countries

1252
01:32:41,580 --> 01:32:45,200
This seems this seems very similar to to the orx pro from system 76

1253
01:32:46,700 --> 01:32:49,980
So that's it. Yeah, so noah, you may already have something very similar to this rig

1254
01:32:51,260 --> 01:32:56,380
Yeah, I know I I figured that the I figured the odm, you know manufacturers probably the same but it just there are small

1255
01:32:56,380 --> 01:33:00,860
Differences of course across them because they're both building them assembling them separately and making right

1256
01:33:00,860 --> 01:33:04,860
And the other thing is is in in in limpy and I had talked about this a little bit is

1257
01:33:05,180 --> 01:33:11,500
That you know various little components inside are are sometimes different and that leads to drastically different. Yeah, it does. Yeah

1258
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:15,980
Yeah, it does. Yeah, and this also you can get with ubuntu mate from uh, entroware, which is kind of nice

1259
01:33:16,060 --> 01:33:18,700
Yes, it uh, it arrived pre-installed with ubuntu

1260
01:33:20,540 --> 01:33:23,340
Yeah, have you have you experimented with battery life much

1261
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:29,100
Uh, no. No, I I haven't plugged it into the main since I received it. So

1262
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:32,780
Um i've been playing with it on and off during the day

1263
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:34,780
I've probably

1264
01:33:34,780 --> 01:33:39,180
Well, I don't know how long we've been sat here this evening. So it's done several hours and yeah

1265
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:44,060
It's about half halfway exhausted at the moment. Well, congratulations. So, you know

1266
01:33:44,780 --> 01:33:48,460
Now kind of so this is where I started thinking about this on the high end

1267
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:52,940
You have these athena's bonobos orx pros these real desktop killers

1268
01:33:52,940 --> 01:33:55,820
They're they're not super portable but they can get you a few hours

1269
01:33:55,820 --> 01:33:59,820
They can move they can move you between your different work spots and then on the other end

1270
01:34:00,060 --> 01:34:05,180
You now have very efficient performance and capabilities from something like the nuke skull canyon

1271
01:34:05,420 --> 01:34:10,940
So compare and contrast those two machines for me wimpy. Do you think uh, when you look at the two spectrums there?

1272
01:34:11,420 --> 01:34:16,620
Is there less and less of a role for you with a traditional desktop tower that you assemble and you put together or you buy?

1273
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:18,220
pre-built is there

1274
01:34:18,220 --> 01:34:20,060
Where's the tower fitting in?

1275
01:34:20,060 --> 01:34:26,220
Well, the the tower computer that I bought in 2008 is one of the boxes that i've sold in order to

1276
01:34:26,540 --> 01:34:28,780
Make the funds available to buy this computer

1277
01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:35,660
So that that computer back in the day in 2008 was a dual quad core xeon with 32 gigs of ram

1278
01:34:36,380 --> 01:34:39,340
Uh, and it had two nvidia something or others in it at the time

1279
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:45,580
Um, so that was a fairly stonking machine when I bought that and that just about expired in time

1280
01:34:45,660 --> 01:34:48,300
It was still worked, but it was it was you know, breathless

1281
01:34:48,300 --> 01:34:50,700
Um doing gaming for example

1282
01:34:51,260 --> 01:34:55,020
So i've sold that and it was massive and it had a 750 watt power supply

1283
01:34:55,740 --> 01:34:59,500
um, and the by comparison the skull canyon nuke

1284
01:35:00,220 --> 01:35:06,780
Um is about three times faster than that quad core xeon from 2008 in terms of cpu

1285
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:08,540
performance

1286
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:14,220
And this this uh box had an nvidia when I sold it had an nvidia

1287
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,780
680 in it

1288
01:35:16,780 --> 01:35:21,340
And the skull canyon nuke with its iris pro 540 could outperform it

1289
01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:26,220
Um on 3d as well, you know for gaming and what have you, you know, isn't that something?

1290
01:35:27,420 --> 01:35:34,140
So i'm using nux so I bought a nuke back in november which i'm very happy with and i've still got

1291
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:38,620
And the only reason I got the skull canyon nuke is because i'm about to replace

1292
01:35:38,620 --> 01:35:46,560
My plex server and I thought i'd buy a nuke to be the plex server and i'd plug external drives into it over usb3

1293
01:35:47,420 --> 01:35:51,260
Okay, because i'm trying to find smaller form factor lower power

1294
01:35:51,740 --> 01:35:55,340
Um solutions and then I thought huh? Well i've got this nuke

1295
01:35:55,980 --> 01:35:57,500
and it's really

1296
01:35:57,500 --> 01:36:00,300
Beefy and then I saw the skull canyon was coming along

1297
01:36:00,300 --> 01:36:02,700
So what i've done is i've bought the skull canyon to become my new

1298
01:36:02,700 --> 01:36:09,820
New desktop workstation and my old nuke which is only six months old is going to become the plex server nice

1299
01:36:10,540 --> 01:36:17,820
Um, but the reason I like the knucks is they're so small. Um, i've now mounted my skull canyon nuke onto the back of my monitor

1300
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:20,300
So everything's now behind

1301
01:36:21,020 --> 01:36:22,300
the screen

1302
01:36:22,300 --> 01:36:28,380
And because I i've got hubs and stuff built into the screen, you know, it's just tidy, you know, I had this massive

1303
01:36:29,260 --> 01:36:31,260
sort of 40 kilo

1304
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:32,540
Mm-hmm

1305
01:36:32,540 --> 01:36:39,900
Del precision workstation. Yeah, and it's got bricks in it. Yeah, and and now it's this tiny little device and uh,

1306
01:36:40,700 --> 01:36:47,820
It's it's great. Uh, so I really like the knucks. They're great workstations and i've the one laptop i've kept is my apollo

1307
01:36:48,620 --> 01:36:50,620
So I still have my apollo

1308
01:36:50,620 --> 01:36:52,300
and that's my

1309
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:54,300
lightweight i'm

1310
01:36:54,300 --> 01:36:56,140
going out so

1311
01:36:56,140 --> 01:37:00,220
Those are people that know me sort of see me in real life

1312
01:37:00,220 --> 01:37:04,380
Uh, I have a habit of going to do coding in the pub

1313
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:06,860
um

1314
01:37:07,820 --> 01:37:12,300
So, um, I I I take myself away for sort of a couple of days

1315
01:37:12,780 --> 01:37:16,860
And I go and camp out in a in a pub and just sort of have a one-man sprint

1316
01:37:17,740 --> 01:37:25,580
um, and that that apollo is the computer that comes with me and it's great for a one day, you know

1317
01:37:25,580 --> 01:37:30,940
You can go anywhere, you know, the battery's going to last you can get stuff done. It's lightweight. It's easy to carry

1318
01:37:31,340 --> 01:37:33,340
but when I go away for a bit longer

1319
01:37:33,980 --> 01:37:36,860
And i'm going to probably work on different things

1320
01:37:36,940 --> 01:37:42,300
I want something a bit more powerful one of the reasons i've got this machine is because I run lots of virtual machines

1321
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:46,700
So i've got the disk space for that now and i've got the ram and the cpu for it

1322
01:37:46,860 --> 01:37:49,020
Yeah, we were talking about snaps earlier

1323
01:37:49,900 --> 01:37:54,220
when you build snap packages on your own machine, you can now do that by um

1324
01:37:54,220 --> 01:38:00,380
Um building them inside, uh lxd containers. So each build is isolated and clean nice

1325
01:38:00,620 --> 01:38:03,580
But you can also build simultaneous snaps

1326
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:06,540
different snaps simultaneously

1327
01:38:06,540 --> 01:38:10,860
So if you're working on several projects, you could actually have three or four snaps building

1328
01:38:10,940 --> 01:38:16,780
So another reason for this machine is that I can have all the cores that workload. Yeah. Yeah, of course

1329
01:38:17,180 --> 01:38:19,660
cool wimpy well congratulations and you know, I

1330
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:24,140
As somebody who recently just got a semi-upgraded desktop here in the studio

1331
01:38:24,700 --> 01:38:28,380
Uh, I I feel like desktops aren't going away from me for a long time. I want capture cards

1332
01:38:28,380 --> 01:38:30,380
I want multiple drives cooling

1333
01:38:30,540 --> 01:38:35,340
but I think and I would be curious really to get the audience's reaction to this is

1334
01:38:35,740 --> 01:38:39,500
If we remove ourselves from the equation and we you know, we just like if you're looking at a chart

1335
01:38:39,500 --> 01:38:41,660
You know, we just chop off our our percentage

1336
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:45,980
How many people realistically that are buying computers say?

1337
01:38:45,980 --> 01:38:50,460
From best buy or going into costco are really going to want desktop towers for much longer

1338
01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:56,860
It seems like that's a dying breed just and it's not to be the not to be the uh, not to use the steve jobs analogy here

1339
01:38:56,860 --> 01:39:00,300
But it really does seem like cars versus trucks. There's going to be a lot less people driving trucks

1340
01:39:00,380 --> 01:39:02,060
Um, and I don't think they're going away

1341
01:39:02,060 --> 01:39:10,060
But to that end I think one of the hazards of it becoming a smaller and smaller market is the components are becoming crappier and crappier

1342
01:39:10,060 --> 01:39:14,860
Yeah, and when you build, you know when you buy when you're trying to build multiple machines and you're buying all the parts

1343
01:39:14,860 --> 01:39:19,260
Most the parts are bad. It's it's becoming more and more of a commodity or i'm sorry

1344
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:25,500
A niche market and the parts are becoming more commoditized in the val and the um quality is going down

1345
01:39:26,060 --> 01:39:29,260
For for the uh, enthusiast market and that's sort of the downside of it all

1346
01:39:29,260 --> 01:39:34,060
So that's why I think when you have companies like entryware and companies like system 76

1347
01:39:34,220 --> 01:39:36,780
And you have dells out there that are shipping linux rigs

1348
01:39:36,940 --> 01:39:43,340
It's nice to have a good set of answers now for pre-built machines where they're being the front line for that kind of problems

1349
01:39:43,340 --> 01:39:47,420
Uh, but there are still options for the rest of us. So my question to the audience is realistically

1350
01:39:48,460 --> 01:39:49,260
What's your over under?

1351
01:39:49,260 --> 01:39:55,820
What's your long shot on how much we have less left on desktop computing for average people linuxactionshow.reddit.com?

1352
01:39:55,900 --> 01:39:59,420
That's where you go to leave your thoughts. I won't be here next week, but mr

1353
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:02,620
Noah will and they have plenty of good things planned for you

1354
01:40:02,620 --> 01:40:04,620
So if you'd like to help them put together a great show

1355
01:40:04,780 --> 01:40:09,100
You can submit topics to linuxactionshow.reddit.com vote them up and comment on them there

1356
01:40:09,100 --> 01:40:16,540

1358
01:40:21,420 --> 01:40:23,180
Jupiter broadcasting

1359
01:40:23,180 --> 01:40:27,660
Two in the morning two in the morning great idea great idea. It's time. I'm kidding

1360
01:40:27,740 --> 01:40:30,380
Yeah, if that was everybody that shows up at two in the morning

1361
01:40:30,940 --> 01:40:33,760
No, and we apologize already check the calendar jupiterbroadcasting.com

1362
01:40:35,180 --> 01:40:37,980

And don't forget your stickers at jupiterbroadcasting.com stickers, and i'll see you back here in two weeks

1364
01:41:07,980 --> 01:41:09,980
So

1365
01:41:30,060 --> 01:41:32,220
There we go, there we go, there we go

1366
01:41:32,220 --> 01:41:37,180
Oh, this is that was it with no music that was it and we're not doing the west

1367
01:41:37,340 --> 01:41:43,500
You missed but we're not doing the music live anymore for a little bit. Okay, which is hard for me. It's hard for me

1368
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:46,060
That's weird. Why I I tried to convince him west

1369
01:41:46,060 --> 01:41:50,700
I was telling him if he just put the theme song in telegram, then he could play it to himself sure your phone sure

1370
01:41:50,780 --> 01:41:55,020
Yeah, that makes total sense. Oh, yeah, I would like that too. JBtitles.com here. I'll show you west

1371
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:58,780
I'll tell you why JBtitles.com JBtitles.com everybody go vote

1372
01:41:58,780 --> 01:42:04,060
Uh, so here's the thing west as noah would say is uh now no you won't be able to hear this because i'm playing

1373
01:42:04,060 --> 01:42:09,900
This on the computer that you're connected to academy. Okay, so uh, prepare yourself for silence. No, i'm I apologize about that

1374
01:42:09,900 --> 01:42:12,160
But let's see. This is going back to 150

1375
01:42:12,780 --> 01:42:15,980
Right. Uh, so here we are west. This is you and me commuting about a kickstarter

1376
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:23,440
5000 so they're they're they're scratching some itch but it's yeah, it's essentially a read only live gnome desktop

1377
01:42:23,740 --> 01:42:26,700
With a decent gnome theme. Yeah, I mean it doesn't look you can hear it

1378
01:42:26,700 --> 01:42:28,140
You know

1379
01:42:28,140 --> 01:42:29,980
Why is it a keyboard as well?

1380
01:42:29,980 --> 01:42:34,140
It well because then it's the tamper proof device where it freaks out when it gets broken. Yeah

1381
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:39,180
You know what guys this is what it tells us. It doesn't matter about the technical. All right

1382
01:42:39,180 --> 01:42:40,700
So here we're about to start the intro music now

1383
01:42:40,700 --> 01:42:44,220
We didn't hear this live west during the show but in post it's obvious. Here it comes

1384
01:42:44,700 --> 01:42:48,060
What it does tell you is that we are in the wrong business

1385
01:42:48,060 --> 01:42:55,580
This is linux unplugged episode 150 for june 21st, 2016. I see what you mean

1386
01:42:57,580 --> 01:42:59,580
Yeah, it sounds horrible

1387
01:43:00,220 --> 01:43:01,900
That's rough

1388
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:05,740
Yeah, so we're just gonna play it in post and then there'll be no processing of it

1389
01:43:06,060 --> 01:43:09,020
So, you know, I think what it is when we try to level out all the different mumble levels

1390
01:43:09,020 --> 01:43:14,560
I think it just butchered the mosaic right that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right jb titles.com

1391
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:16,560
Um

1392
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:18,800
Let's go boat

1393
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:24,800
Universal package paradigms not just a packaging solution snap a packet ship it. Can we do three weeks of packaging?

1394
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:26,880
I don't know if we can guys

1395
01:43:26,940 --> 01:43:31,040
Universal divide that's not bad. Love packaging. Oh, dude. We love it

1396
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:36,000
Love it. Noah is number one intro where pub laptop going full intro where the red hat summit

1397
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:38,720
cross packaging solutions

1398
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:39,840
I think uh, I think uh

1399
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:44,080
I think I owe no apology because I upset it as I upset him when I talked bad about his bay

1400
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:46,720
I am sorry. Noah. I didn't mean to make you upset

1401
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:51,840
Uh my apologies. Here's the thing. You just you you said something incorrect and I and I corrected

1402
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:58,400
You have the right to be incorrect this is america, okay. All right good good good

1403
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:03,280
Yeah, all right. So that's it. That's all it was fuck the eu what don't say that

1404
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:09,380
uh, I say balder dash jb titles.com jb titles.com

1405
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:12,060
I

1406
01:44:12,060 --> 01:44:14,060
experienced life in freedom

1407
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:16,880
I don't know about universal package paradigms

1408
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:22,160
I don't I don't know if I want my last show before vacation being about being titled about packaging. I just

1409
01:44:22,720 --> 01:44:24,560
that feels like a

1410
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:27,120
A failure on my part like I didn't show up for duty

1411
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:31,280
Although we did have a good organic discussion about it. They're fools

1412
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:39,120
Yeah, jb titles.com. No, I've you gone do you see when you like what about you?

1413
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:42,880
Did you see when you're like, thanks for making it west. Where are you right now? Where are you?

1414
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:46,080
I'm at the beautiful east hotel in downtown portland

1415
01:44:46,620 --> 01:44:48,640
downtown portland, I I I I just

1416
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:52,160
You know last I heard you were just uh rubbing elbows with linus. So

1417
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:58,320
You know, we're just best buds now. He's a very nice guy face to face. I heard you were making him breakfast

1418
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:03,120
He loves his eggs bacon and turkey toast. He made fun of my suit

1419
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:08,640
Yeah, that's true. That is true. Yeah, that is that is that is noah's experience with linus

1420
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:10,320
Yes, yeah

1421
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:14,320
I was at the next one and I was there a client had paid for for my trip down there

1422
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:18,400
And and paid for the hotel and everything and um, and so I was representing them

1423
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:22,640
I was in a suit and I was with there's other people there from the company

1424
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:25,840
And and I walked up met him and shook his hand got my picture and he's like

1425
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:31,360
Why are you wearing suit kind of like that's amazing. Yeah, he's like you shouldn't wear a suit

1426
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:34,560
This is this is you're the only person here wearing a suit. That's that's very strange

1427
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:38,720
I don't know why you'd wear a suit here and i'm like not because other people because the company wearing suits

1428
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:41,760
So he questioned your linux like credentials, basically

1429
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:49,360
Yeah, exactly that's rough man, that's right I got a chip on my you could never make a curl yeah

1430
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:54,160
Yeah, yeah, which I mean is true I couldn't either but whatever

1431
01:45:54,160 --> 01:45:56,160

01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:26,880
Okay, maybe the soundboard's right here on the machine. But yeah, I don't know about i'm sure it's in there

1442
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:44,720
I appreciate it very much. Uh, chris i'm gonna miss you in a whole week for several without seeing you

1443
01:46:46,240 --> 01:46:49,040
Oh wimpy wait you had intro where news that I missed what was that?

1444
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:56,640
Oh, well, they were listening live, uh, and they were just saying that the european shipping stuff is is about to launch any day now

01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:58,880

All right. Well everybody's for them. Everybody treat noah nice

He may or may not be in studio next week for that

1450
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:15,120
I think we should switch them up server two or three times maybe

1451
01:47:15,120 --> 01:47:19,120
Yeah, no, no, I changed the website that'd be good address actually

1452
01:47:21,680 --> 01:47:24,880
All of that's actually happening between now and the next show so

1453
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:32,400
The mumble server's changed we got to shut down the old mumble server and the website's moving this weekend. So

1454
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:35,760
You're welcome though

1455
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:39,360
Uh, no the site the site for the null server's done. Yeah

1456
01:47:40,240 --> 01:47:42,240
The transfer for the old thing's already done

1457
01:47:42,780 --> 01:47:44,000
remember

1458
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:48,320
Make jb great again. Noah. Okay, that's your mission, you know, here's my mission

1459
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:49,840
Here's here you're gonna start a new slogan

1460
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:53,200
I'm gonna get you a hat and a flat brimmed hat and everything and it's going to say

1461
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:57,760
Screw it. We'll fix it in post or no. No, no, no, no screw it. Somebody else will fix it in post

1462
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
No, come on, you know me I do

1463
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:06,160
Out of all the people on the network i'm the guy that least puts it on rika to fix it because yes

1464
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:08,560
You know unless it's comcast

1465
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:09,360
Yeah

1466
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:14,000
Well on the other point the other point of view i'm just saying there might be other people on the network that are worse

1467
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:17,280
About it. Welcome to bsd unplugged. I won't call out names

1468
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:21,440
But there may be people on the network. This is bsd unplugged

1469
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:25,440
They expect a lot done in post and it's not me those bsd guys don't know how to make anything

1470
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:29,040
What how did you know it was them? I didn't say anything what what?
