00:00.000 --> 00:18.000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 263, for August 21st, 2018.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.720
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's pushing all of the buttons,

00:21.720 --> 00:25.080
installing the distros, and just happy to be here to talk about free software.

00:25.080 --> 00:26.080
My name is Chris.

00:26.080 --> 00:27.080
My name is Wes.

00:27.080 --> 00:28.080
Hello, Wes.

00:28.080 --> 00:29.080
It's good to be with you, sir.

00:29.080 --> 00:30.080
I hope you're feeling well.

00:30.080 --> 00:31.080
Oh, yeah.

00:31.080 --> 00:32.080
I mean...

00:32.080 --> 00:33.080
This smoke isn't getting to you?

00:33.080 --> 00:34.080
It's very smoky.

00:34.080 --> 00:37.080
I do feel cold-smoked, but I'm persevering, and more tasty.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.080
Yeah.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.720
We have some smoke in the Washington area.

00:39.720 --> 00:42.760
It is thick out there, but that doesn't stop the Linux content coming down the pipe to

00:42.760 --> 00:43.760
you.

00:43.760 --> 00:46.960
Coming up on this week's episode of the Unplugged program, Docker has found itself in a bit

00:46.960 --> 00:49.800
of a controversy, and it's probably not the one you're thinking about.

00:49.800 --> 00:53.820
It's one canonical found themselves in a long, long, long time ago, and it's one that sometimes

00:53.820 --> 00:58.180
our friends over at Elementary OS get a hard time about, but somehow, when it's Docker,

00:58.180 --> 00:59.180
it's egregious.

00:59.180 --> 01:00.180
We'll tell you about that.

01:00.180 --> 01:02.000
Plus, Flatpak has a big release.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
They're making a big stink.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.160
Some new features and some really exciting stuff is coming down the pipe for Flatpak.

01:07.160 --> 01:09.160
We'll cover a couple of cool apps.

01:09.160 --> 01:13.840
We'll get an update on some community events like Academy, AugCamp18, and one that's up

01:13.840 --> 01:18.880
just around the corner, and then, at the end of the show, it seems there's a bit of a dispute

01:18.880 --> 01:23.800
between Intel and Debian when it comes to distributing those firmware updates that are

01:23.800 --> 01:26.600
fixing all of those problems, like Meltdown.

01:26.600 --> 01:32.240
You see, in the last couple of months, there's been some changes in licensing verbiage, and

01:32.240 --> 01:34.360
the Debian project is calling Intel out.

01:34.360 --> 01:38.880
We'll tell you what's going on there and why Intel says, guys, guys, guys, there's nothing

01:38.880 --> 01:39.880
to worry about.

01:39.880 --> 01:42.560
And then, let's get your life in order.

01:42.560 --> 01:43.560
Let's document things.

01:43.560 --> 01:47.760
We'll give you a way to create your own man pages in seconds on your Linux box.

01:47.760 --> 01:48.840
That's some stuff.

01:48.840 --> 01:49.840
I'm excited.

01:49.840 --> 01:53.180
And also, we have a full stack today.

01:53.180 --> 01:54.180
We have a full stack.

01:54.180 --> 01:55.440
So first of all, let's start with Brent.

01:55.440 --> 01:56.440
Brent is here.

01:56.440 --> 01:57.440
Hey, guys.

01:57.440 --> 01:58.440
How's it going?

01:58.440 --> 01:59.440
Good, good.

01:59.440 --> 02:00.440
And the Mumble Room is here.

02:00.440 --> 02:01.440
Hello, Virtual Lug.

02:01.440 --> 02:02.440
Hello.

02:02.440 --> 02:03.440
Hello.

02:03.440 --> 02:04.440
We got a Wimpy in there.

02:04.440 --> 02:05.440
We got Joe in there.

02:05.440 --> 02:09.800
We got Dan and Cassidy from Elementary OS in there today, plus just some favorites in there,

02:09.800 --> 02:12.160
like Mr. Mac is in there as always.

02:12.160 --> 02:15.140
Thomas from KDE is joining us to talk about Academy here in a little bit.

02:15.140 --> 02:16.520
So we just have a full room.

02:16.520 --> 02:19.400
I can't see everybody in the room, but I can see a lot of names in there, and that's a

02:19.400 --> 02:20.400
good list.

02:20.400 --> 02:26.080
So let's kick things off with the news, and that is that Docker is upsetting a lot of

02:26.080 --> 02:27.080
people.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.380
You see, Wes, they made a little change.

02:29.380 --> 02:32.560
They made a change on how downloads work.

02:32.560 --> 02:38.080
If you're downloading the Mac version or the Windows version of Docker, you now must provide

02:38.080 --> 02:44.440
your email address before you can download Docker, that you have to go through an email

02:44.440 --> 02:47.600
address that is associated with the Docker store.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.760
So you also would have to then, I suppose, make a Docker store account.

02:49.760 --> 02:50.760
Oh, man.

02:50.760 --> 02:53.680
Is this like one of those white papers that no one ever wants to download ever?

02:53.680 --> 02:54.680
No.

02:54.680 --> 02:56.760
It's like the Docker community edition, like the full Docker software.

02:56.760 --> 02:58.720
The regular Docker install.

02:58.720 --> 03:02.480
To get that free software, you now have to log in with your store account.

03:02.480 --> 03:06.080
That's a big change, or at least it seems like it to the end user.

03:06.080 --> 03:07.400
What's their motivation here?

03:07.400 --> 03:11.940
Well, so when it was brought out to them, they said, okay, all right, well, we appreciate

03:11.940 --> 03:18.060
that this is bothering you, and we understand that this can feel like a nuisance, but we've

03:18.060 --> 03:22.360
made this change to make sure we can improve the Docker for Mac and Windows experience

03:22.360 --> 03:24.700
for users moving forward.

03:24.700 --> 03:28.240
So the things don't need to change, we'll just close this issue, but you can feel free

03:28.240 --> 03:32.640
to continue to comment, you know, because they're going to improve your experience.

03:32.640 --> 03:36.760
You know, it's funny, it's like this was an issue, but then when that line started to

03:36.760 --> 03:41.120
help improve your experience, then it just blew up, because it turns out anybody who's

03:41.120 --> 03:44.500
clever enough to use Docker is clever enough to read through a marketing line when they

03:44.500 --> 03:45.500
see one.

03:45.500 --> 03:46.500
Yeah, I think so.

03:46.500 --> 03:48.480
And so the controversy really is around two things.

03:48.480 --> 03:52.440
Number one, that they're using this bullshit to improve your experience line, and number

03:52.440 --> 04:00.000
two is that it is putting essentially free software behind a Docker store account, like

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
a Docker hub account.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.200
And you have to log into that hub account to download the software.

04:04.200 --> 04:06.640
Now presumably you could still compile it for yourself.

04:06.640 --> 04:10.720
That's just not something users on those platforms are very much accustomed to doing.

04:10.720 --> 04:13.040
Right, and it's not like they're going to go app get it on Windows.

04:13.040 --> 04:16.480
Do we have any sympathy, either you Chris or anyone in the Mumble Room for the desire,

04:16.480 --> 04:19.200
you know, we've been talking about elementary efforts, we've talked about Ubuntu wanting

04:19.200 --> 04:21.440
more information from user installs.

04:21.440 --> 04:24.800
Is there any legitimate purpose to the side of, you know, we just want more information

04:24.800 --> 04:27.600
and does this process actually give them that?

04:27.600 --> 04:29.620
Yeah, like what information?

04:29.620 --> 04:33.900
So I, you know, I joked in the intro that both canonical and elementary OS have kind

04:33.900 --> 04:36.760
of gotten heat for something similar.

04:36.760 --> 04:39.680
And that is, you know, a download button where there's a dollar amount that you can enter.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.160
That got people all kinds of upset too.

04:42.160 --> 04:45.800
Now there's you don't have to sign up, you could just hit zero and download.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.920
So I guess let's start there.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.880
I'm kind of curious to know what the elementary OS guys.

04:49.880 --> 04:51.920
So Dan, what do you think about this, this move?

04:51.920 --> 04:59.000
And do you see a big difference between putting it behind a suggested pay what you want and

04:59.000 --> 05:02.920
putting it behind an account where you have to have like an account on their service?

05:02.920 --> 05:08.080
I think requiring an account makes it a lot harder that I think we should encourage the

05:08.080 --> 05:11.440
monetization of software, especially if it's things we care about because we want them

05:11.440 --> 05:12.440
to be around.

05:12.440 --> 05:13.440
We want them to be long lasting.

05:13.440 --> 05:19.000
Yeah, we don't want, especially for really visible projects like Docker, you don't want

05:19.000 --> 05:21.440
them to be controlled by special interests.

05:21.440 --> 05:24.440
So Cassidy, I'm curious to know what you think about the messaging aspect of this.

05:24.440 --> 05:28.720
It seems like whenever you make a move like this, you put free software behind a level

05:28.720 --> 05:31.240
of nuisance, as they put it.

05:31.240 --> 05:33.240
You really have to manage the messaging.

05:33.240 --> 05:34.920
You know, you really have to be careful in how you handle that.

05:34.920 --> 05:35.920
What are your thoughts on that?

05:35.920 --> 05:40.380
Yeah, I think it's always really hard, especially when you're coming from a place where you're

05:40.380 --> 05:41.380
making a change.

05:41.380 --> 05:45.640
You know, you had this thing before and you could get it one way before and now you've

05:45.640 --> 05:49.720
made a change and now you have to provide more information or something to get it.

05:49.720 --> 05:51.800
That's a really tough move.

05:51.800 --> 05:56.920
You know, when we basically rephrased our download to be paying for elementary OS, we

05:56.920 --> 06:00.320
were really careful to always say you're paying for elementary OS.

06:00.320 --> 06:06.280
You're not being heavily encouraged to optionally download or optionally donate or something.

06:06.280 --> 06:08.440
We just said you're paying for it.

06:08.440 --> 06:10.400
But you know, people didn't like that either too.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.120
So it's always really tough.

06:12.120 --> 06:16.160
Well, let's just keep moving right along and let's talk about Flatpak 1.0.

06:16.160 --> 06:20.080
It's a big release from the team this week and Flatpak 1.0 comes with a collection of

06:20.080 --> 06:22.940
new features that application developers can take advantage of.

06:22.940 --> 06:26.700
The number one thing that will probably make a big change in your life is developers can

06:26.700 --> 06:31.700
now mark their apps as end of life, which would indicate they're no longer supported.

06:31.700 --> 06:35.640
There is a new mechanism for apps to restart themselves, which is useful if they have to

06:35.640 --> 06:36.860
get access to something.

06:36.860 --> 06:41.080
So a prompt comes up says, can I have access to this and you say yes.

06:41.080 --> 06:44.720
And furthermore, Flatpak has seen a lot of stability improvements.

06:44.720 --> 06:47.880
Some of the biggest changes though are the ecosystem, Flatpak hub has seen some nice

06:47.880 --> 06:48.880
updates.

06:48.880 --> 06:50.640
There's more and more apps on there now.

06:50.640 --> 06:52.880
And they're pretty proud of this release.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.760
There's several different posts about it.

06:54.760 --> 06:59.540
And one feature that jumped out at me that I would like to poke wimpy about is this new

06:59.540 --> 07:03.840
portal system that allows apps to create sandboxes and then restart themselves.

07:03.840 --> 07:07.480
It allows applications to restart after they've been updated to start using a newer version

07:07.480 --> 07:11.040
or to increase sandboxing for parts of the application.

07:11.040 --> 07:12.280
Is this wimpy?

07:12.280 --> 07:13.280
Is this this?

07:13.280 --> 07:16.900
I've been hearing about this XGD portal, I think it's called, which is like a system

07:16.900 --> 07:21.120
where applications could request access to say the camera.

07:21.120 --> 07:25.120
And then the user at the time that goes to get a prompt at the time that tried to access

07:25.120 --> 07:29.280
the camera and the user would accept or deny sort of like you see in your web browser.

07:29.280 --> 07:30.280
Have you heard of this?

07:30.280 --> 07:32.520
Yeah, yeah, I'm familiar with this.

07:32.520 --> 07:39.160
And we did some work with upstream flat pack a few months ago.

07:39.160 --> 07:43.040
So that portal integration exists in snaps as well.

07:43.040 --> 07:45.040
Ah, that was my next question.

07:45.040 --> 07:46.040
Yeah.

07:46.040 --> 07:48.640
So we're all we're all we're all playing nicely in the same sample there.

07:48.640 --> 07:49.880
Yeah, I like to hear that.

07:49.880 --> 07:51.680
That's really great.

07:51.680 --> 07:54.320
I want to know more about flat packs, peer to peer installs option.

07:54.320 --> 07:56.880
That's not something I'm very familiar with either.

07:56.880 --> 07:58.480
That seems like it could be interesting.

07:58.480 --> 08:00.960
Another note here, they've gone the opposite way of Dropbox.

08:00.960 --> 08:05.240
They no longer require a file system that has extended attributes.

08:05.240 --> 08:07.240
Nice.

08:07.240 --> 08:11.400
Now most of the things when we talk about flat back, they tend to be pretty technical

08:11.400 --> 08:12.400
topic.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.680
The flat pack team seems to really like to talk about the technical details.

08:14.680 --> 08:16.360
I mean, and those are important to get right.

08:16.360 --> 08:17.360
Yeah, but you're right.

08:17.360 --> 08:20.200
That has been a lot of the messaging, maybe less so than some of their competitors.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.320
Yeah, like when when you hear about snaps, you hear about snap packages, you hear about

08:23.320 --> 08:24.320
new applications.

08:24.320 --> 08:25.320
Exactly.

08:25.320 --> 08:26.320
You don't often hear a lot about the technology.

08:26.320 --> 08:27.320
I mean, it's there.

08:27.320 --> 08:28.320
If you go digging for it.

08:28.320 --> 08:29.320
It's all out there.

08:29.320 --> 08:33.480
If you're working with a certain Mr. Martin Wimpress, then it comes out.

08:33.480 --> 08:37.320
So I thought that was interesting, just a different kind of communication mode.

08:37.320 --> 08:41.480
But here's a little bit of the non technical stuff wrote by Alexander Larson.

08:41.480 --> 08:44.360
He writes, most of my blog posts are about technical details.

08:44.360 --> 08:47.800
But the reason for the existence of flat pack is not technical.

08:47.800 --> 08:53.240
I created flat pack because the Linux application desktop ecosystem is fundamentally broken.

08:53.240 --> 08:57.080
As an app developer, you have no sane way to distribute the results of your work to

08:57.080 --> 08:58.080
users.

08:58.080 --> 09:01.800
Unless you have massive resources, the only realistic way is to wait for distributions

09:01.800 --> 09:03.920
to pick up your app.

09:03.920 --> 09:06.160
But we know that's riddled with issues.

09:06.160 --> 09:07.160
There's many problems there.

09:07.160 --> 09:09.640
Not all distros will pick up an app, first of all.

09:09.640 --> 09:13.440
And when they do, it's often a chicken and the egg problem where there's maybe like a

09:13.440 --> 09:16.440
web API that has to get updated, but you have to have a different version of PHP on the

09:16.440 --> 09:17.440
back end.

09:17.440 --> 09:20.860
And so like there's this there's like this multi tier dependency situation that can sometimes

09:20.860 --> 09:22.480
block app updates, right?

09:22.480 --> 09:26.160
Some applications just are not well structured in a way not in bad in general, but just in

09:26.160 --> 09:29.840
a way that with traditional Linux applications are structured.

09:29.840 --> 09:36.480
And you also have this this inevitable disconnect and middleman between the application developer

09:36.480 --> 09:37.480
and end user.

09:37.480 --> 09:42.920
So if you have a bug in Mumble, let's say, you probably should be first checking the

09:42.920 --> 09:47.760
Ubuntu bug tracker or the Fedora bug tracker for Mumble and see what the packager has in

09:47.760 --> 09:49.280
there and see if it's a Fedora.

09:49.280 --> 09:51.520
And then you get a reply back saying, no, this is an upstream bug.

09:51.520 --> 09:54.640
And then as an end user, you know, you go upstream.

09:54.640 --> 10:00.200
And I think this is a huge reason why we have all of these freeloaders of free software,

10:00.200 --> 10:01.440
because it's just it's tedious.

10:01.440 --> 10:05.580
It's tedious and it's almost it's almost just too disconnected.

10:05.580 --> 10:09.320
And so with Flatpak, the goal is for the upstream developer to have control of updates.

10:09.320 --> 10:13.880
If the developer fixes an important bug, a new stable version is released so that users

10:13.880 --> 10:15.320
can immediately use it.

10:15.320 --> 10:19.300
Any bugs filed will be against the latest stable version.

10:19.300 --> 10:24.860
So the other thing that really does mean, I guess if you break it down, is that it means

10:24.860 --> 10:28.100
when you report bugs as a user, it's useful to you.

10:28.100 --> 10:31.920
There's a direct connection and you get immediate feedback and you get you get an immediate

10:31.920 --> 10:34.320
state a new state of the app.

10:34.320 --> 10:37.920
And I think that's really a good thing for a lot of type of applications.

10:37.920 --> 10:45.400
But we are witnessing a fundamental paradigm shift in how software is deployed on Linux.

10:45.400 --> 10:50.200
And we've seen other fundamental paradigm shifts before and we've survived just fine.

10:50.200 --> 10:53.000
So it's nothing to get concerned about.

10:53.000 --> 10:59.720
But the repo model truly is a sysadmin model and Flatpaks and snaps and Docker images and

10:59.720 --> 11:01.840
app images.

11:01.840 --> 11:06.360
Any way that you can easily distribute software and get it going is really the developer model

11:06.360 --> 11:08.040
to distribute software.

11:08.040 --> 11:11.520
And in the past, the sysadmins acted as a gatekeeper.

11:11.520 --> 11:15.480
The repo was like a like an approved application.

11:15.480 --> 11:17.840
Now in practice, was it really that?

11:17.840 --> 11:18.840
Probably not.

11:18.840 --> 11:19.840
Right.

11:19.840 --> 11:20.840
I mean, really.

11:20.840 --> 11:21.840
Come on, let's be honest.

11:21.840 --> 11:22.840
People are probably just rushing to get the work in there sometimes.

11:22.840 --> 11:24.000
They're not like doing extensive tests.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.760
That's not true for all distros, but it's probably the case for some.

11:27.760 --> 11:30.120
But it does represent a fundamental shift here.

11:30.120 --> 11:31.580
You know, you had to be root.

11:31.580 --> 11:34.500
You had to have access to the package management system.

11:34.500 --> 11:40.680
The operating system was tracking all of those packages and you were in control of when you

11:40.680 --> 11:43.800
updated them or didn't update them.

11:43.800 --> 11:50.000
Now, with a lot of these things, Chrome started it really early on on Windows and Mac.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.440
But it's you've just seen it take off.

11:51.440 --> 11:53.640
You've seen it take off.

11:53.640 --> 11:57.520
I'm struggling to think of a couple of examples on Linux desktop that currently auto update

11:57.520 --> 11:59.000
that aren't snaps.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.320
I can't think of any.

12:00.320 --> 12:04.240
It just really hasn't taken off on the Linux desktop side, auto update of applications.

12:04.240 --> 12:07.760
Maybe some electron apps, but those are bringing some methods from their other environments.

12:07.760 --> 12:08.760
No, no.

12:08.760 --> 12:14.960
So on with electron, the only auto update mechanism that exists is for Windows and Mac

12:14.960 --> 12:15.960
OS.

12:15.960 --> 12:21.520
And unless you're publishing, you know, via one of the container formats that supports

12:21.520 --> 12:22.520
updates.

12:22.520 --> 12:25.320
OK, so this is a big shift.

12:25.320 --> 12:27.480
And how do we feel about that?

12:27.480 --> 12:32.360
I think I'm good with it, you know, because you got to keep in mind these things are containered.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.640
They have restricted access.

12:34.640 --> 12:37.900
They're not they're not updating all of the libraries on your system.

12:37.900 --> 12:41.880
They're not necessarily dependent on what version of GTK or Qt you have installed.

12:41.880 --> 12:48.660
So the all of the reasons why you needed a master orchestrator to orchestrate your packages

12:48.660 --> 12:50.640
are beginning to get chipped away.

12:50.640 --> 12:56.480
What the only real argument I can still have here with it and concern would be, well, you're

12:56.480 --> 12:58.320
you're fundamentally taking away my control.

12:58.320 --> 13:04.440
Obviously, I could disable those update features, but defaults reign supreme.

13:04.440 --> 13:07.120
What do you think about that lack of control fundamentally think about your computer?

13:07.120 --> 13:11.320
How would you feel if we got to a point a couple of years where the majority of your

13:11.320 --> 13:14.560
desktop applications were just self-updating all the time?

13:14.560 --> 13:15.560
How would you feel about that?

13:15.560 --> 13:20.160
I mean, I think in many ways we are there just in that so much of what we use is really

13:20.160 --> 13:22.700
just a slim front end for back end servers.

13:22.700 --> 13:26.480
And we don't control the rollouts of those APIs or that software.

13:26.480 --> 13:27.480
Hardly at all.

13:27.480 --> 13:28.480
Yeah, you are right.

13:28.480 --> 13:31.560
I think you are trading some control or at least easy understandability.

13:31.560 --> 13:35.840
Now, most cases that you still have all of that, at least for open source things packaged

13:35.840 --> 13:37.960
with these formats, but you're right.

13:37.960 --> 13:41.360
It was a time with a system in where you could carefully craft, you could see all your dependencies,

13:41.360 --> 13:43.920
you knew that, oh, yes, you've got all this dynamic linking.

13:43.920 --> 13:47.640
And here's my one little app that I run, I trust all my system libraries that are maintained

13:47.640 --> 13:48.920
in a sane way.

13:48.920 --> 13:52.400
And it all kind of just fit together, at least if you had the software you needed.

13:52.400 --> 13:56.240
The developer mindset of today are really just the the idea of I'm getting this package,

13:56.240 --> 13:59.920
I know I'm getting it from this developer, I don't need the middleman, I just want it

13:59.920 --> 14:00.920
to work.

14:00.920 --> 14:04.960
So as long as you trust the upstream that you're getting those updates on, it might

14:04.960 --> 14:05.960
be a good thing, right?

14:05.960 --> 14:09.680
And there might be a little then more to have, you didn't have to wait as the developer for

14:09.680 --> 14:13.600
your distribution to pick like, oh, yeah, this, we're pushing out a new release.

14:13.600 --> 14:16.800
And this looks like a good version of this over here, we'll pull in that version, you

14:16.800 --> 14:21.320
get to decide, hey, it's time, I feel good about this, it's stable, have at it.

14:21.320 --> 14:22.320
I do like that.

14:22.320 --> 14:25.600
That's why, you know, sometimes you'll have like stable versions of a snap, and you'll

14:25.600 --> 14:26.660
have an edge version.

14:26.660 --> 14:32.160
But Brent, I'm curious to know what you think, you know, using your computer as a professional

14:32.160 --> 14:36.640
photo workstation, you would, I would imagine be a little alarmed if you opened up dark

14:36.640 --> 14:39.480
table or something one day, and it was a totally different UI.

14:39.480 --> 14:42.920
For anybody who's doing production, I think that it's critical to know that your system

14:42.920 --> 14:44.520
isn't changing under you.

14:44.520 --> 14:48.800
And so if you're, you know, on a deadline or something like that, then I don't know

14:48.800 --> 14:54.320
if this auto update is exactly what you will want to have happen without some kind of schedule,

14:54.320 --> 14:55.320
right?

14:55.320 --> 14:59.920
And so I know one thing I hear so often on the Windows side of things is that that Windows

14:59.920 --> 15:05.240
update just kills everybody during, you know, presentations, we've all seen it, right?

15:05.240 --> 15:07.920
Just trying to get stuff done, and all of a sudden your computer changes under you.

15:07.920 --> 15:12.600
I think a core part of the difference there is that it is the containerization and sandboxing,

15:12.600 --> 15:13.600
right?

15:13.600 --> 15:16.980
Like, Chris, you've certainly experienced, you did a bad arch update way too close to

15:16.980 --> 15:19.800
a show, or maybe I did in reality.

15:19.800 --> 15:24.400
And your system is not quite hosed, but unless you've done a lot of other work to do a rollback,

15:24.400 --> 15:25.400
you just don't have that option.

15:25.400 --> 15:29.660
And maybe you've tainted a lot of things on your system with a flat back, not so.

15:29.660 --> 15:33.540
In the context of snaps, there's a couple of things to bear in mind there.

15:33.540 --> 15:40.040
First of all, if an update happens beneath a running application, then that doesn't kill

15:40.040 --> 15:43.300
or destroy the application that you're using.

15:43.300 --> 15:50.200
The update happens in a new revision, and the next time you restart, you know, close,

15:50.200 --> 15:55.840
rerun the application, then the update that happened in the background is applied effectively.

15:55.840 --> 16:02.600
And also as an application publisher, you can take advantage of a facility called Trax.

16:02.600 --> 16:08.600
So if you have, you know, major versions that introduce new and potentially breaking features,

16:08.600 --> 16:15.560
then you can publish Trax by version or whatever, so that, you know, as a conservative user,

16:15.560 --> 16:20.980
if you've opted into the 1.0 release, you can stay with that for as long as you want.

16:20.980 --> 16:26.400
And then you make the decision to jump from the 1.0 release to the 2.0 release, for example.

16:26.400 --> 16:32.840
Whereas if you want just security fixes, like everyone does, I want those automatically.

16:32.840 --> 16:38.080
Features and, you know, improvements and maybe even bug fixes, not so sure about, but if

16:38.080 --> 16:42.120
it's security patches, I want those while I'm not even at my computer.

16:42.120 --> 16:43.120
Right.

16:43.120 --> 16:49.160
And so, you know, the publisher will be producing their 1.0 dot, you know, whatever minor version,

16:49.160 --> 16:52.880
and they would push their bug fixes and security fixes in there.

16:52.880 --> 16:58.000
And then you can choose when you want to hop on to the, you know, the new release train

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
via a track.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.160
And there are lots of publishers that are using that mechanism.

17:02.160 --> 17:09.040
It will soon be possible with snaps to also install different versions of the same snap

17:09.040 --> 17:15.000
in parallel side by side so you can have the old version and the future version installed

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
side by side.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
Yeah.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
All right.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.280
So, Dan, the last word on this.

17:19.280 --> 17:20.280
So, Dan, what are your thoughts?

17:20.280 --> 17:21.280
Yeah.

17:21.280 --> 17:25.420
I mean, I think something we also got to consider is that we're coming from a world where we're

17:25.420 --> 17:30.400
used to applications only really being able to be updated every six months or every year

17:30.400 --> 17:33.160
or whatever your distro release cycle is.

17:33.160 --> 17:39.160
And app developers that are targeting the Linux desktop have really long release cycles.

17:39.160 --> 17:44.240
Mainstream apps that are already used to faster release cycle models or software as a service

17:44.240 --> 17:47.160
and things like that, they're used to doing more incremental changes.

17:47.160 --> 17:51.560
But I think we're going to see more developers doing incremental changes.

17:51.560 --> 17:56.000
I don't think you're going to see like big, massive reworks of entire things that break

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
your workflow.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.840
It's going to be little tweaks and refinements and you won't really notice changes like really

18:00.840 --> 18:01.840
rapidly.

18:01.840 --> 18:02.840
That makes sense.

18:02.840 --> 18:06.360
And it would probably be much well received by end users, you know, small incremental

18:06.360 --> 18:08.600
changes, just steady improvements.

18:08.600 --> 18:11.720
It's also easier to get some feedback and make quick course corrections that way as

18:11.720 --> 18:12.720
well.

18:12.720 --> 18:13.720
Yeah.

18:13.720 --> 18:14.720
All right.

18:14.720 --> 18:15.720
I know we have more to talk about.

18:15.720 --> 18:20.480
I don't know if we have time, but I just wanted to give you a couple of pics just from Flatpak

18:20.480 --> 18:23.440
while we're talking about Flatpak and Flatpak Hub.

18:23.440 --> 18:25.840
And the first one is PulseFX.

18:25.840 --> 18:28.560
PulseFX is an audio manipulation tool.

18:28.560 --> 18:33.400
And it's really great because if you just want to pop on a compressor or do a high pass

18:33.400 --> 18:37.320
or a low pass on some audio or I do run it through an EQ, like maybe got a podcast that's

18:37.320 --> 18:42.120
a little hard to understand or something like that, PulseFX will do that for you.

18:42.120 --> 18:45.360
And then on the snap side, I noticed a new snap package came out this week that looks

18:45.360 --> 18:46.360
really neat.

18:46.360 --> 18:49.120
I always like having like an alternative web browser.

18:49.120 --> 18:52.160
Like I've got my main browser, which is Firefox and I've got Chrome and I even have Opera

18:52.160 --> 18:56.680
installed and Opera would be like the one that I do like that one off log into or, you

18:56.680 --> 18:59.120
know, you know, when it's like no minimum extension.

18:59.120 --> 19:00.120
So it's always really fast.

19:00.120 --> 19:01.680
You got a lot of you maybe have got a big session going.

19:01.680 --> 19:02.960
You want just another mindset.

19:02.960 --> 19:03.960
Yeah.

19:03.960 --> 19:07.880
I noticed there is a tabless browser that just showed up in the Snap Store.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.160
I'm looking for the name for right now.

19:09.160 --> 19:11.520
I don't know if you happen to know it off the top of your head, Wimpy, by any chance.

19:11.520 --> 19:12.520
It's Calibri.

19:12.520 --> 19:13.520
Calibri.

19:13.520 --> 19:14.520
Yeah.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.320
That's what I mean when you search for Calibri.

19:16.320 --> 19:21.040
So if you want to Google it, search for like Calibri browser or just do a snap find.

19:21.040 --> 19:22.320
And that looked pretty neat, too.

19:22.320 --> 19:26.440
So that that joins Opera recently is several browser options in the Snap Store.

19:26.440 --> 19:27.440
It's pretty neat.

19:27.440 --> 19:30.040
It makes it real easy when you want to bootstrap a new system.

19:30.040 --> 19:31.040
That's for sure.

19:31.040 --> 19:32.040
Yeah.

19:32.040 --> 19:33.040
All right.

19:33.040 --> 19:34.040
So there is some some community news.

19:34.040 --> 19:38.040
We're going to do a tight episode today because I got to get out of here for a doctor's appointment

19:38.040 --> 19:39.520
just in about a half hour.

19:39.520 --> 19:41.340
So it's going to be like a tight show.

19:41.340 --> 19:46.560
So I want to get to Academy this week because that just wrapped up.

19:46.560 --> 19:47.680
And Thomas has joined us.

19:47.680 --> 19:52.260
He is a board member over at KDE and he went to Academy.

19:52.260 --> 19:56.440
And so we thought we'd use this opportunity to pick his brain about what Academy is and

19:56.440 --> 20:01.920
what kind of happened there and why KDE has an event like this and all that stuff.

20:01.920 --> 20:03.440
So, Thomas, welcome to Linux Unplugged.

20:03.440 --> 20:04.440
Thank you.

20:04.440 --> 20:05.440
Hi.

20:05.440 --> 20:06.440
Hi.

20:06.440 --> 20:10.680
So why don't we start with a little bit about yourself and then we'll get to Academy.

20:10.680 --> 20:11.680
Okay.

20:11.680 --> 20:12.680
Yeah.

20:12.680 --> 20:18.760
So, yeah, I've been in the KDE community since about 10 years or so.

20:18.760 --> 20:25.400
And I've actually joined in the user experience usability team since now two years.

20:25.400 --> 20:33.480
I've been on the board of directors of KDEV, which is the official organization of KDE.

20:33.480 --> 20:41.440
And we do things like, for example, organize the Academy, which is the yearly KDE community

20:41.440 --> 20:44.040
and contributors conference.

20:44.040 --> 20:45.040
Very good.

20:45.040 --> 20:50.400
So if I recall correctly, it's a two-day event within like a couple of days or a few days

20:50.400 --> 20:54.100
of workshops and whatnot and birds of the feather sessions and things like that.

20:54.100 --> 20:56.040
So what's the goal of Academy?

20:56.040 --> 21:00.160
Is this really like a time to bring people under the KDE umbrella together in one spot?

21:00.160 --> 21:01.160
Yeah, exactly.

21:01.160 --> 21:02.160
That's about it.

21:02.160 --> 21:07.840
So it's, yeah, as you said, the two days of regular conference with talks where people

21:07.840 --> 21:11.560
just update the community on what they've been up to.

21:11.560 --> 21:19.160
It can be application developers, plasma developers, designers.

21:19.160 --> 21:25.280
It's really just, yeah, seeing what others have been doing.

21:25.280 --> 21:30.640
And then this is followed, as you said, by the what you call both days, which is workshops

21:30.640 --> 21:36.920
and just communities discussing what they've what they plan for the next for the upcoming

21:36.920 --> 21:44.480
year and or just some people gathering around a specific topic and just trying to come up

21:44.480 --> 21:45.480
with new ideas.

21:45.480 --> 21:46.480
Yeah, absolutely.

21:46.480 --> 21:50.440
So give me an idea of what got done this year at Academy.

21:50.440 --> 21:56.920
One very interesting thing this year was that we had several hardware vendors at Academy

21:56.920 --> 22:03.000
who are going to use our technology in the near future.

22:03.000 --> 22:14.000
So we had Pine64, who are making an ARM based cheap laptop, who are now going to use plasma

22:14.000 --> 22:16.080
as a desktop available on there.

22:16.080 --> 22:28.160
We had Mycroft, who, as you probably all know, making desktop AI and virtual digital assistant.

22:28.160 --> 22:37.200
And they've become interested in us when one of us created an integration of Mycroft into

22:37.200 --> 22:44.200
Plasma Desktop and are now looking into more tighter cooperation with us.

22:44.200 --> 22:54.160
And yeah, we also had Slimbook, who have now been doing the second KDE focused laptop.

22:54.160 --> 23:01.920
And we also had Purism, who will offer Plasma as one of the operating systems for the new

23:01.920 --> 23:04.000
phone.

23:04.000 --> 23:10.800
And yeah, having all of them at Academy was really interesting because they also talked

23:10.800 --> 23:18.280
among each other and thought about how they could collaborate and also learned about what

23:18.280 --> 23:21.600
kind of ways they could use our technology in their hardware.

23:21.600 --> 23:26.520
So that is something which is fairly new for us and it's really exciting to be working

23:26.520 --> 23:29.400
together with the industry, with hardware vendors.

23:29.400 --> 23:30.400
No kidding.

23:30.400 --> 23:31.400
Yeah, I bet.

23:31.400 --> 23:34.720
That sounds like it was immensely valuable to have everybody there and have specifically

23:34.720 --> 23:35.820
those hardware folks there.

23:35.820 --> 23:41.340
That is really exciting to see that interest in KDE and I assume the Plasma Desktop too.

23:41.340 --> 23:46.140
So one of the number one questions that always comes into the show whenever we mention, oh,

23:46.140 --> 23:50.880
Academy happened, is do you release any of the talks or any of the sessions or any videos

23:50.880 --> 23:51.880
of the event?

23:51.880 --> 23:52.880
Yeah, we do.

23:52.880 --> 23:56.960
So it's all on the Academy website.

23:56.960 --> 24:02.440
If you go, I think they're not available yet, but they will be available sometime in the

24:02.440 --> 24:03.440
coming weeks.

24:03.440 --> 24:09.400
You just go to the academy.kde.org website, then go to the program and then you have all

24:09.400 --> 24:16.760
the sessions and then there's the video and the slides if the presenter has uploaded them.

24:16.760 --> 24:19.640
But definitely the video is available for all the talks.

24:19.640 --> 24:20.640
Great.

24:20.640 --> 24:21.640
And it moves around, right?

24:21.640 --> 24:23.880
So I imagine it'll be somewhere different next year?

24:23.880 --> 24:24.920
Yeah, definitely.

24:24.920 --> 24:28.240
We haven't decided on a location yet.

24:28.240 --> 24:34.840
So if somebody has an idea and has a team of people who would like to host an Academy,

24:34.840 --> 24:37.840
then yeah, we're still open for suggestions.

24:37.840 --> 24:43.880
And yeah, so far it's been always within Europe, but we are also open to any locations outside

24:43.880 --> 24:44.880
of Europe.

24:44.880 --> 24:48.360
So it will be interesting to see where Academy will happen next year.

24:48.360 --> 24:52.960
All right, Canada, you heard it here first, Canada, you could totally host Academy next

24:52.960 --> 24:53.960
year.

24:53.960 --> 24:54.960
I'm just saying.

24:54.960 --> 24:55.960
Brent, you could get that going, right?

24:55.960 --> 24:56.960
We're going to work on it.

24:56.960 --> 24:57.960
I'll see what I can do.

24:57.960 --> 24:58.960
I'll talk to my people.

24:58.960 --> 24:59.960
He's still getting one big room.

24:59.960 --> 25:00.960
Chat it out.

25:00.960 --> 25:01.960
That's fine.

25:01.960 --> 25:04.320
I'm totally baggsy-ing this now before Popey hears about it.

25:04.320 --> 25:05.920
Yeah, he went.

25:05.920 --> 25:07.280
I was going to...

25:07.280 --> 25:10.360
I'm hoping to hear his impressions on the Ubuntu podcast soon because...

25:10.360 --> 25:15.400
You will hear all about Popey's impressions of Academy on Thursday when we release the

25:15.400 --> 25:17.000
next episode of the Ubuntu podcast.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.520
Well, I will, as always, be listening because I'll be curious to hear that.

25:20.520 --> 25:22.280
Well, Thomas, thank you for coming on and telling us about it.

25:22.280 --> 25:24.200
Is there anything else you want to relay to the audience?

25:24.200 --> 25:30.520
I'll have academy.kde.org linked in the show notes so people can check that out and keep

25:30.520 --> 25:31.640
an eye out for when the videos come.

25:31.640 --> 25:35.040
Is there any other resources they should probably know about?

25:35.040 --> 25:42.440
There's also dot.kde.org, which is our main news site and which had a summary of each

25:42.440 --> 25:48.320
day and both the conference days and of the both days, so that can also be a quick entrance

25:48.320 --> 25:49.320
point.

25:49.320 --> 25:50.320
I see.

25:50.320 --> 25:51.320
And there's some video up there, too.

25:51.320 --> 25:52.320
Yeah.

25:52.320 --> 25:53.320
All right.

25:53.320 --> 25:56.320
Well, if you're a Plasma and KDE fan, something you should be checking out.

25:56.320 --> 25:58.800
Anyways, well, Thomas, thank you very much for coming on and taking the time to tell

25:58.800 --> 26:00.200
us about it.

26:00.200 --> 26:01.600
Sounds like it was a great event.

26:01.600 --> 26:03.080
I'm really happy to hear that.

26:03.080 --> 26:07.920
Now, while we're talking about community events, I would like to pick Mr. Wimpy's brain and

26:07.920 --> 26:11.320
perhaps Joe, if he wants to share with the class, too, about AugCamp, which is another

26:11.320 --> 26:13.040
event that I have not been to.

26:13.040 --> 26:21.120
AugCamp just wrapped up, AugCamp 18 on August 18th and August 19th in 2018, and it sounds

26:21.120 --> 26:22.960
like it's a pretty fun event.

26:22.960 --> 26:26.760
At least according to the guys' voices, which sounds like they had a little too much to

26:26.760 --> 26:27.760
drink.

26:27.760 --> 26:31.120
So why don't we start with Wimpy?

26:31.120 --> 26:33.080
How was your trip to AugCamp, Wimpy?

26:33.080 --> 26:36.080
Well, as always, brilliant fun.

26:36.080 --> 26:38.520
So started on the Friday.

26:38.520 --> 26:44.480
I rolled out the Ubuntu podcast Battle Bus, picked Poppy up from the local station, then

26:44.480 --> 26:49.400
we drove to meet Mark at his house, and then all the way up to Sheffield, and then out

26:49.400 --> 26:55.000
for the social event on the Friday evening, the first meetup at AugCamp, which took place

26:55.000 --> 27:01.720
in a pub in the town center, and we pretty much took over the whole top floor of this

27:01.720 --> 27:03.680
pub, which was good.

27:03.680 --> 27:06.600
Nice to see people you don't see very often, like Joe, for example.

27:06.600 --> 27:09.720
I only see Joe maybe two or three times a year.

27:09.720 --> 27:12.320
So good to catch up with Joe.

27:12.320 --> 27:13.320
Yeah.

27:13.320 --> 27:14.920
Now, what actually happens there, though?

27:14.920 --> 27:17.560
I mean, what you just told me was you went out and had a good time.

27:17.560 --> 27:20.960
And that is part of what happens, right, isn't it, Joe?

27:20.960 --> 27:25.280
That's everything that happened for me, I'm afraid.

27:25.280 --> 27:26.280
Honesty to the last.

27:26.280 --> 27:27.280
Yeah.

27:27.280 --> 27:28.280
Yeah.

27:28.280 --> 27:29.280
Why is that a bad thing, though, really?

27:29.280 --> 27:31.400
I mean, if you go in there, you have a good time hanging out with Linux folks.

27:31.400 --> 27:32.400
It's worth it, right?

27:32.400 --> 27:33.400
Yeah.

27:33.400 --> 27:37.320
I just made the mistake that I drank too much on the Friday and then ended up not actually

27:37.320 --> 27:41.680
waking up in time to see any of the talks and then making the exact same mistake on

27:41.680 --> 27:42.680
the Saturday.

27:42.680 --> 27:49.200
But thankfully, Wimpy and Poppy and Co actually managed to get up, so yeah, fill me in, man.

27:49.200 --> 27:51.360
I was there, but I didn't see any of it.

27:51.360 --> 27:53.040
So what did I miss?

27:53.040 --> 28:02.800
So Ogg Camp is a free culture unconference, and the organizers do arrange like a talk

28:02.800 --> 28:07.400
every hour or so, so that there is something happening on the main stage.

28:07.400 --> 28:13.240
So if you just turn up and everyone's feeling shy, there is something to sort of see and

28:13.240 --> 28:14.820
learn from.

28:14.820 --> 28:20.280
So there were three stages, the main auditorium and two smaller stages, and then there was

28:20.280 --> 28:26.560
also a Coder Dojo, which was run by Ben Nuttall from the Raspberry Pi Foundation.

28:26.560 --> 28:33.160
And that was basically a full weekend of teaching kids how to get started with programming and

28:33.160 --> 28:35.320
make interesting Raspberry Pi projects.

28:35.320 --> 28:43.800
And I spent most of Sunday morning up there and it was just chock full of games controllers

28:43.800 --> 28:50.920
and micro bits and robot parts and projecting equipment and musical instruments and all

28:50.920 --> 28:56.360
manner of stuff that they were furiously plugging together and hacking about with and making

28:56.360 --> 28:57.360
projects out of it.

28:57.360 --> 28:59.240
It was pretty fantastic to see.

28:59.240 --> 29:00.240
I bet.

29:00.240 --> 29:01.240
Hmm.

29:01.240 --> 29:05.760
And then in terms of the talks, there's obviously the scheduled talks.

29:05.760 --> 29:11.120
Some of those this year included somebody talking about, you know, configuration management

29:11.120 --> 29:16.120
via the various tools that exist and giving people a primer on that.

29:16.120 --> 29:23.320
And one of my favorite talks was by a guy who was running mainframe emulators on a Raspberry

29:23.320 --> 29:28.760
Pi, which was just brilliant fun, yeah, really good fun.

29:28.760 --> 29:33.580
So if you think that, you know, it's sort of those are the two extremes of, you know,

29:33.580 --> 29:37.280
what you can expect to find, you know, and everything in between, you know, a little

29:37.280 --> 29:44.040
bit about, you know, cooperative organizations and the, you know, the free culture and open

29:44.040 --> 29:46.800
source communities.

29:46.800 --> 29:51.260
And one, I think one or two live podcasts this year.

29:51.260 --> 29:55.160
So we did a big mashup with Joe.

29:55.160 --> 29:58.600
So that will be coming out on Joe's channel, he'll have details about that.

29:58.600 --> 30:03.960
And a couple of, most of the podcasts in the UK sort of meet there and some of them do

30:03.960 --> 30:06.440
their live shows from our camp as well.

30:06.440 --> 30:08.520
I'm only just a little bit jealous, Chris.

30:08.520 --> 30:09.520
I know.

30:09.520 --> 30:10.520
I know.

30:10.520 --> 30:11.520
Me too.

30:11.520 --> 30:13.120
I was like, ah, ah, I want to go one of these days.

30:13.120 --> 30:14.120
One of these days.

30:14.120 --> 30:15.120
I'll just come hang out.

30:15.120 --> 30:16.120
One of these years anyway.

30:16.120 --> 30:17.120
Yeah.

30:17.120 --> 30:18.120
I want to ride in the battle bus.

30:18.120 --> 30:19.120
Me too.

30:19.120 --> 30:20.120
That sounds like a good time.

30:20.120 --> 30:23.960
The battle bus is fully Wi-Fi operational with power sockets for all popular makes and

30:23.960 --> 30:24.960
models of laptops.

30:24.960 --> 30:25.960
Very nice.

30:25.960 --> 30:27.800
That is a battle bus.

30:27.800 --> 30:29.520
That is a bus that's designed for an event.

30:29.520 --> 30:31.640
It probably is.

30:31.640 --> 30:34.720
Now I guess I should also give a mention to Foscon.

30:34.720 --> 30:36.760
I won't be there, but I thought I'd mention it.

30:36.760 --> 30:40.180
It's going to be in Philadelphia and it's coming up very soon.

30:40.180 --> 30:44.880
So go check this out, foscon.us if you want to go.

30:44.880 --> 30:49.720
And they are doing it, I think, August 25th, yep, August 25th.

30:49.720 --> 30:54.480
So if you are in the Philadelphia area and would like to go to a free open source software

30:54.480 --> 30:58.440
focused event, Foscon 2018 in the International House of Philadelphia.

30:58.440 --> 30:59.440
Huh.

30:59.440 --> 31:01.080
How about that, Wes?

31:01.080 --> 31:02.080
Looks like it should be a good time.

31:02.080 --> 31:05.160
I don't suppose you're just going to randomly be in Philadelphia in a couple days.

31:05.160 --> 31:06.160
Alas, no.

31:06.160 --> 31:07.160
No.

31:07.160 --> 31:08.160
No.

31:08.160 --> 31:09.160
No, probably not.

31:09.160 --> 31:10.160
No, no.

31:10.160 --> 31:11.160
No, neither will I.

31:11.160 --> 31:12.160
But it does look like a good time.

31:12.160 --> 31:14.240
For everyone who's lucky enough to be around that area.

31:14.240 --> 31:15.240
So what's the verdict?

31:15.240 --> 31:16.240
Is there going to be an odd camp?

31:16.240 --> 31:17.240
Is this an odd camp?

31:17.240 --> 31:18.240
Is it going strong?

31:18.240 --> 31:19.240
Is there an odd camp next year?

31:19.240 --> 31:20.400
Is that being discussed yet?

31:20.400 --> 31:21.400
Does anybody know?

31:21.400 --> 31:26.840
There are already discussions about how to put on an odd camp again next year.

31:26.840 --> 31:33.000
And the wonderful John Spriggs, also known as John the Nice Guy Spriggs, is starting

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
to bootstrap things.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
Oh.

31:35.000 --> 31:39.600
There is already a Trello board, and there has been some activity this morning.

31:39.600 --> 31:40.760
Very good.

31:40.760 --> 31:44.720
So let's take a moment and thank the sponsors of this year's show.

31:44.720 --> 31:46.360
And like I said, we're doing a tight one this week.

31:46.360 --> 31:48.880
And I want to get to this Intel stuff, and I want to get to making your own man pages

31:48.880 --> 31:51.040
with this cool command, because it's just the best.

31:51.040 --> 31:52.600
So let's start by thanking Ting.

31:52.600 --> 31:55.760
Go to linux.ting.com to get $25 off a device.

31:55.760 --> 31:58.660
Or if you bring your own device, you get $25 in service credit.

31:58.660 --> 32:03.480
The average Ting bill is just $23 per phone per month, because it's smarter than unlimited.

32:03.480 --> 32:04.800
If you use less, you pay less.

32:04.800 --> 32:06.520
You pay for what you use wireless.

32:06.520 --> 32:08.360
Nationwide coverage with no contracts.

32:08.360 --> 32:12.000
However much you talk, text, or data you use, that's what you pay.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.880
That's why I've been a Ting customer for over four years, and they've got a great control

32:14.880 --> 32:15.880
panel.

32:15.880 --> 32:16.880
Radically good customer.

32:16.880 --> 32:17.880
Different than everybody.

32:17.880 --> 32:18.880
Just better than everybody.

32:18.880 --> 32:19.880
Customer service.

32:19.880 --> 32:20.880
I mean, it's seriously better than everybody.

32:20.880 --> 32:25.440
They have a bunch of really great devices, and Ting does a really good job of sorting

32:25.440 --> 32:30.600
through devices that should get a lot more attention, but they just, from the general

32:30.600 --> 32:33.320
tech press, from your Verge outlets, they just don't get that attention.

32:33.320 --> 32:35.520
And there's so many good phones out there.

32:35.520 --> 32:38.920
You don't have to spend $1,000 on a smartphone.

32:38.920 --> 32:43.320
And whatever you are comfortable spending, you go to Ting's site, and you own that phone

32:43.320 --> 32:44.320
outright.

32:44.320 --> 32:45.320
It's yours.

32:45.320 --> 32:46.320
There's no contract.

32:46.320 --> 32:47.320
There's no other termination fee.

32:47.320 --> 32:48.320
It's yours.

32:48.320 --> 32:49.320
Look at that.

32:49.320 --> 32:50.320
They have a 10-inch tab on here.

32:50.320 --> 32:52.680
Oh, I haven't seen them sell on a tablet for a long time.

32:52.680 --> 32:53.680
No.

32:53.680 --> 32:54.680
$170 when you go to linux.ting.com.

32:54.680 --> 32:55.680
That is not bad.

32:55.680 --> 32:56.680
Yeah, with a 10-inch display?

32:56.680 --> 32:57.680
Yeah.

32:57.680 --> 32:58.680
That isn't bad.

32:58.680 --> 32:59.680
Hmm.

32:59.680 --> 33:00.680
Anyways, it's a great service.

33:00.680 --> 33:03.200
I've been a customer for a long time.

33:03.200 --> 33:04.200
I think you'll love it.

33:04.200 --> 33:05.200
So go to linux.ting.com.

33:05.200 --> 33:08.160
Something else I've been a customer for forever.

33:08.160 --> 33:09.160
DigitalOsh.

33:09.160 --> 33:10.160
DigitalOcean.

33:10.160 --> 33:13.480
D-O dot C-O slash unplugged.

33:13.480 --> 33:18.600
Give you a $100 credit when you sign up with a new account for 60 days, and you can try

33:18.600 --> 33:20.600
out their infrastructure for 60 days.

33:20.600 --> 33:22.600
With that $100 credit, you can do just about anything.

33:22.600 --> 33:24.600
Wait, are you sure that's right?

33:24.600 --> 33:25.600
$100 credit?

33:25.600 --> 33:26.600
I know.

33:26.600 --> 33:28.600
I'm waiting for them to figure out that they accidentally are still giving us that promo.

33:28.600 --> 33:29.600
So hurry.

33:29.600 --> 33:35.000
I'm like, guys, go out there and use this, because they can't keep doing that, can they?

33:35.000 --> 33:37.120
I mean, I don't know, man.

33:37.120 --> 33:39.200
It's a great deal, though, because you can do so much stuff.

33:39.200 --> 33:43.440
And every system has SSDs, and they've got 40-gigabit connections coming into the hypervisors,

33:43.440 --> 33:44.780
a great dashboard.

33:44.780 --> 33:45.780
It's only getting better.

33:45.780 --> 33:48.960
There are a bunch of new dashboard changes that are just blowing my mind.

33:48.960 --> 33:49.960
Yeah, really good.

33:49.960 --> 33:53.520
Like, how often does that happen, where they do like a big shift like that, and it's not

33:53.520 --> 33:54.520
a total controversy?

33:54.520 --> 33:55.520
I logged in.

33:55.520 --> 33:58.120
They had made some changes, and it didn't stop me at all.

33:58.120 --> 33:59.680
In fact, if anything, it was more intuitive.

33:59.680 --> 34:01.720
Yeah, they really do get the design of that kind of stuff.

34:01.720 --> 34:06.000
It's a great platform to get you up and going with Linux box in seconds, really.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.640
Probably less than 55 seconds.

34:07.640 --> 34:10.380
And you can play with something you've been wanting to try for a long time up on their

34:10.380 --> 34:13.360
crazy fast infrastructure, and then pop it into production.

34:13.360 --> 34:19.440
So go to do.co slash unplugged, and thank you to Linux Academy, linuxacademy.com slash

34:19.440 --> 34:20.440
unplugged.

34:20.440 --> 34:22.760
It's a platform to learn everything about Linux, the stuff that's going to look good

34:22.760 --> 34:26.000
on your resume, the stuff that's going to give you critical thinking skills, and the

34:26.000 --> 34:30.380
stuff you should just know, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

34:30.380 --> 34:34.160
Every member has access to so much content, and they're always adding new content.

34:34.160 --> 34:39.560
They've been expanding out their Google Cloud Platform, Azure, security, and of course,

34:39.560 --> 34:41.640
the essentials of Linux itself.

34:41.640 --> 34:45.700
It's interesting to really see how the market is growing so, so fast, and how Linux Academy

34:45.700 --> 34:51.520
is impressively managing to keep up, despite the fact that their content is so rich and

34:51.520 --> 34:58.240
deep that it can take, I don't know if they've ever released the number publicly, but making

34:58.240 --> 35:03.560
content is always much harder than you think, and they can spend more than several months

35:03.560 --> 35:05.320
working on one set of courseware.

35:05.320 --> 35:08.440
Yeah, something that takes you just a few minutes to click through, or an hour or two

35:08.440 --> 35:09.440
to finish.

35:09.440 --> 35:13.760
And they will spend, because it's like developing a full product, with labs, and interactive

35:13.760 --> 35:20.900
diagrams, and videos, and voiceovers, and text guides, and study cards, and downloadable

35:20.900 --> 35:25.360
stuff that you can listen to, like audio, or personal study books, like if it's really

35:25.360 --> 35:26.360
comprehensive.

35:26.360 --> 35:29.200
And then if you ever get stuck, they've got a real human being that can help you, that

35:29.200 --> 35:35.080
are topic experts, that are folks from the industry that Linux Academy has hired to not

35:35.080 --> 35:37.980
only create the courseware, but to answer your questions with it too.

35:37.980 --> 35:42.200
So a lot of times, when you get stuck, you are asking the person that created that courseware,

35:42.200 --> 35:46.540
so not only are they a topic expert on that subject, but they're the ones that created

35:46.540 --> 35:47.600
that course.

35:47.600 --> 35:49.560
So it's really helpful.

35:49.560 --> 35:53.600
It's so, so valuable, and that's just part of why Linux Academy is such a great value,

35:53.600 --> 35:58.440
and you can try it seven days for free, when you go to linuxacademy.com, slash, unplugged.

35:58.440 --> 36:01.160
That's linuxacademy.com, slash, unplugged.

36:01.160 --> 36:02.880
You like my mic grab there?

36:02.880 --> 36:05.880
Oh man, that was just, you're a professional broadcaster.

36:05.880 --> 36:08.720
I appreciate a good mic grab, I bet.

36:08.720 --> 36:09.720
Grab me by the mic, I always say.

36:09.720 --> 36:10.720
Wes, I've always said that, haven't I?

36:10.720 --> 36:11.720
I've always said that.

36:11.720 --> 36:14.220
Let's talk about this Intel firmware thing.

36:14.220 --> 36:20.240
So Debian has labeled Intel firmware as now unredistributable by all OS vendors.

36:20.240 --> 36:22.600
They're speaking for everyone there.

36:22.600 --> 36:27.260
And this is something that catches my attention, because Debian is very careful about licensing,

36:27.260 --> 36:29.200
and they really go through this kind of stuff.

36:29.200 --> 36:34.360
And so here's essentially a breakdown of what happened.

36:34.360 --> 36:39.280
Intel pushed out a new firmware update recently, and they reached out to some of the projects,

36:39.280 --> 36:42.900
like Debian, and said, hey, new firmware needs to go out.

36:42.900 --> 36:44.960
Can you package this up and send it?

36:44.960 --> 36:49.360
To which Debian promptly responded, no, we can't, because you changed your license in

36:49.360 --> 36:54.760
an incompatible way a month ago, and now we can no longer redistribute firmware updates.

36:54.760 --> 36:57.720
And they link them to the text file that says, sorry, we can't do that.

36:57.720 --> 37:05.440
And some folks have tweeted rather strong feelings about the situation that Intel is

37:05.440 --> 37:07.000
putting users in.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
Here's one.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.720
Intel really effed up on the foreshadow and SSBD microcode updates.

37:11.720 --> 37:16.800
Beyond any of my wildest thoughts, they added a long license to the microcode that doesn't

37:16.800 --> 37:21.520
allow redistribution, which is why Linux distributions won't be getting patched.

37:21.520 --> 37:23.960
Well, we know that's not true.

37:23.960 --> 37:24.960
They are already getting patched.

37:24.960 --> 37:28.360
Right, and there are other distributions that are distributing these already.

37:28.360 --> 37:29.920
So yeah, not universal.

37:29.920 --> 37:34.680
So it was like, we tried to figure out what's going on here, and I dug around, and I found

37:34.680 --> 37:39.620
a tweet by the corporate vice president and GM of Intel's Open Source Technology Center.

37:39.620 --> 37:41.720
That seems like a good source to go to, right?

37:41.720 --> 37:44.080
So dug in there, and here's his reply.

37:44.080 --> 37:46.440
He says, this is just simply not true.

37:46.440 --> 37:48.480
You see, this is now legalese.

37:48.480 --> 37:54.380
The license section two, subsection three, grants rights needed for redistribution, specifically,

37:54.380 --> 37:58.460
and he's quoting, distribute an object code representation of the software provided by

37:58.460 --> 38:01.080
Intel through multiple levers of distribution.

38:01.080 --> 38:03.860
We're happy to work with them if there's still concerns.

38:03.860 --> 38:12.640
So now we have a Debian says and Intel says situation, and it sort of created this impasse.

38:12.640 --> 38:15.200
And it's so funny how we get hung up on this kind of stuff.

38:15.200 --> 38:18.040
And I'm sure eventually get resolved, and it'll probably be resolved in a way that's

38:18.040 --> 38:19.800
beneficial for end users.

38:19.800 --> 38:23.500
But it has caused quite the upset on this particular thing.

38:23.500 --> 38:26.400
Lots of finger pointing at Intel for screwing this whole thing up.

38:26.400 --> 38:28.960
And so the response has been, well, so now what?

38:28.960 --> 38:29.960
So now what do we do?

38:29.960 --> 38:32.680
So Debian looks at it a little further, and they say, well, here's the problem.

38:32.680 --> 38:36.480
Above where you just told us to look, it says that, but before that, that we can't redistribute

38:36.480 --> 38:37.480
it.

38:37.480 --> 38:39.520
So we have ourselves a conflict within your license.

38:39.520 --> 38:43.800
Your license says you cannot distribute, and then further down says you can distribute.

38:43.800 --> 38:45.120
We don't know what to do here.

38:45.120 --> 38:49.980
And as far as I know, the last time I looked into this issue, that's where it has landed.

38:49.980 --> 38:52.920
It's landed on, eh, Debian's not really sure what to do.

38:52.920 --> 38:56.560
And I mean, it does seem like they are working with Intel, and I've seen some other, you

38:56.560 --> 39:00.520
know, asking people to don't just go harassing Intel.

39:00.520 --> 39:02.920
They have their own channels, and things are being worked on.

39:02.920 --> 39:03.920
Yeah, they are.

39:03.920 --> 39:04.920
Yes.

39:04.920 --> 39:07.600
It is kind of confusing, too, because like if you go download some of the tarballs here,

39:07.600 --> 39:12.120
the previous microcode release doesn't have the license file in there.

39:12.120 --> 39:15.600
But when prompted on the website, it pops up a thing that you do have to agree to the

39:15.600 --> 39:17.160
license to get the link.

39:17.160 --> 39:19.980
Now once you have the link, you can just download it.

39:19.980 --> 39:22.780
On the latest one, no such pop up, but a license in the tarball.

39:22.780 --> 39:26.000
So clearly there are some changes, and I can see why, you know, Debian does have a long

39:26.000 --> 39:28.740
history of caring a lot about open source licensing.

39:28.740 --> 39:33.220
And while often as end users we might feel it can be pedantic at times, it is actually

39:33.220 --> 39:34.220
pretty important.

39:34.220 --> 39:36.680
So I can understand why they would want to take the cautious side.

39:36.680 --> 39:37.680
Yeah.

39:37.680 --> 39:38.680
Yeah.

39:38.680 --> 39:41.600
And I should also add that for a lot of these things, you know, you can rebuild the package

39:41.600 --> 39:42.760
yourself pretty easily.

39:42.760 --> 39:44.280
You can install the microcode manually.

39:44.280 --> 39:48.160
If you are a, you know, a big cloud provider, this is not the problem that you're having.

39:48.160 --> 39:50.120
It's more of a problem just for people like you and I.

39:50.120 --> 39:51.120
Fair point.

39:51.120 --> 39:52.120
Yeah.

39:52.120 --> 39:53.120
Yeah.

39:53.120 --> 39:54.120
Yeah.

39:54.120 --> 39:55.120
Just us end users getting screwed.

39:55.120 --> 39:56.120
Yeah.

39:56.120 --> 39:57.120
All right.

39:57.120 --> 39:59.880
Well, I have a sense this is going to get worked out.

39:59.880 --> 40:01.420
I really do.

40:01.420 --> 40:03.480
And if anybody knows anything different, send me a tweet.

40:03.480 --> 40:04.480
Let me know where this is going.

40:04.480 --> 40:05.720
But I have a sense it's going to get worked out.

40:05.720 --> 40:06.720
All right.

40:06.720 --> 40:12.260
Well, then let's, let's, let's end on a way for people to create their own man pages.

40:12.260 --> 40:16.240
Man pages are one of the greatest things that I didn't know about when I switched to Linux

40:16.240 --> 40:22.620
initially until like six, seven months in because I was, I was very fortunate that I

40:22.620 --> 40:24.460
started playing with Linux in high school.

40:24.460 --> 40:28.860
And so that meant there was other high school kids that I could mess around with and we

40:28.860 --> 40:31.720
all just bounced off each other, you know, look what you can do here.

40:31.720 --> 40:32.720
Try this out.

40:32.720 --> 40:33.720
Oh, this is red hat.

40:33.720 --> 40:36.260
This is this, you know, this is Debbie and this is, you know, we just, that was our mode.

40:36.260 --> 40:41.320
We didn't, and there was no Google cause I'm so old.

40:41.320 --> 40:43.760
There was no like web search to go like look up commands.

40:43.760 --> 40:46.900
So like not knowing that man existed was a huge oversight.

40:46.900 --> 40:51.600
It's a way it's you, you could get away with never using man today and just searching everything

40:51.600 --> 40:52.600
you need on Google.

40:52.600 --> 40:54.720
Now, I don't recommend that you do that, but you're totally right.

40:54.720 --> 40:55.920
You absolutely can.

40:55.920 --> 40:57.800
And you probably just find some online man pages.

40:57.800 --> 40:58.800
Yeah.

40:58.800 --> 41:02.280
So this is why this was egregious because there was a early on and some of you might

41:02.280 --> 41:04.640
remember this, there was the Linux documentation project.

41:04.640 --> 41:07.400
I don't know if that rings a bell for some of you out there.

41:07.400 --> 41:14.320
And it was a valiant effort by a community on the internet to create a central repository

41:14.320 --> 41:19.720
of documentation on how to do things, which was outdated immediately.

41:19.720 --> 41:23.280
And obviously it was only applicable to certain distros, et cetera.

41:23.280 --> 41:25.840
So it never really was that great of a resource.

41:25.840 --> 41:28.600
And it couldn't compare to all of the other communities that are writing specifically

41:28.600 --> 41:31.280
about their distros that Google now helps you surface.

41:31.280 --> 41:35.640
So it took me a little while to find man, but once I found the man page system, I was

41:35.640 --> 41:39.320
so impressed, like, wow, they just have this built in right here at the command line.

41:39.320 --> 41:40.640
Like I can see example commands here.

41:40.640 --> 41:44.160
And that's when I really went, you know, when I realized you could bring up a man page and

41:44.160 --> 41:46.760
generally if you went all the way down to the bottom, there's a few example commands.

41:46.760 --> 41:50.240
Offline just all of this knowledge right at your fingertips.

41:50.240 --> 41:54.680
I feel like it's a bigger deal than we are capable of appreciating right now.

41:54.680 --> 41:59.080
And I don't know if that sounds silly, but I feel like today it's like, oh yeah, no big

41:59.080 --> 42:00.080
deal.

42:00.080 --> 42:03.160
But if you think about what life was like when you couldn't just easily search for stuff,

42:03.160 --> 42:05.040
that really, really helped.

42:05.040 --> 42:11.000
And that's how life is today for things that are sort of unique to your own setup or your

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
own world.

42:12.000 --> 42:16.840
And wouldn't it be nice if you could have your own man pages so you can remember how

42:16.840 --> 42:17.840
to do stuff?

42:17.840 --> 42:23.360
Well, that's where this handy command that I love the name of comes in.

42:23.360 --> 42:29.720
It's called um, um, um, how do I?

42:29.720 --> 42:34.520
And um is a command line utility for creating and maintaining your own set of man like help

42:34.520 --> 42:35.520
pages.

42:35.520 --> 42:38.600
Man being short for manual if you didn't know.

42:38.600 --> 42:40.280
And I love this.

42:40.280 --> 42:43.680
These man pages are written to be comprehensive, but what humans really need are just bullet

42:43.680 --> 42:44.680
points.

42:44.680 --> 42:47.400
So you could use um to just write your own bullet points and they would come out on the

42:47.400 --> 42:54.920
command line and they include a couple of basic syntax formatting tips and a couple

42:54.920 --> 42:59.740
of basic commands you can run and it's so neat.

42:59.740 --> 43:05.360
It's a only available for Mac OS right now, but I just sent off a letter to the developer

43:05.360 --> 43:10.600
today saying, Hey, and you know, I think that is also just because they've only packaged

43:10.600 --> 43:13.040
it in homebrew cause I've got it running right here.

43:13.040 --> 43:14.040
Well, that's awesome.

43:14.040 --> 43:17.320
I was going to say, yeah, Hey, there is some ways to get this installed on Linux that don't

43:17.320 --> 43:18.320
use brew.

43:18.320 --> 43:20.640
I saw, I sent off a note to him today, so maybe we'll see something there, but yeah,

43:20.640 --> 43:22.680
you can build it yourself.

43:22.680 --> 43:23.680
And what do you think?

43:23.680 --> 43:24.680
Well, okay.

43:24.680 --> 43:29.160
So there are already ways to make man pages extensible and there's a lot of design in

43:29.160 --> 43:32.760
man page systems that, you know, just to facilitate that a bit.

43:32.760 --> 43:36.060
That said, I think there is something of a disconnect between people that are experts

43:36.060 --> 43:37.060
and how to do that.

43:37.060 --> 43:40.560
And then especially know, you know, how to typeset and create man pages in the proper

43:40.560 --> 43:43.200
or at least historically correct ways.

43:43.200 --> 43:48.280
I think again, where this tool maybe shines and we'll see how popular it becomes is that

43:48.280 --> 43:53.700
that casual developer, you use man pages somehow, you don't really understand how it all works,

43:53.700 --> 43:58.080
but if you can just type a command and you know, you just have to edit a markdown file.

43:58.080 --> 44:01.600
It uses Pandoc and other stuff behind the scenes to convert that, display it with man

44:01.600 --> 44:03.120
like utilities.

44:03.120 --> 44:04.120
It does look nice.

44:04.120 --> 44:06.280
And I just added a couple and it was really easy.

44:06.280 --> 44:08.320
So I think that's the, that's the kicker right there.

44:08.320 --> 44:09.320
Cool.

44:09.320 --> 44:13.120
Now Brent, you've got a whole solution for your own man management right now.

44:13.120 --> 44:17.360
Well, I would say it's my attempt at cobbling something like this together in the last several

44:17.360 --> 44:18.360
years.

44:18.360 --> 44:23.140
Um, I, and I'm sure I'm not the only one doing this, but, uh, I've just kind of started to

44:23.140 --> 44:28.880
half hazardly keeping text files of notes of solutions and tricks and little shortcuts

44:28.880 --> 44:35.080
of various commands and, uh, in basically just text files in a folder that gets synced

44:35.080 --> 44:36.080
to all my machines.

44:36.080 --> 44:41.500
And, uh, so it would be interesting to see it in a little bit of a slight ever so slightly

44:41.500 --> 44:44.000
easier to access, um, solution like this.

44:44.000 --> 44:45.280
I kind of like this idea.

44:45.280 --> 44:46.280
Yeah.

44:46.280 --> 44:48.640
Getting to sync would be like the next thing, right?

44:48.640 --> 44:52.240
Sinking it across like maybe even like it wouldn't have to sync continuously just when

44:52.240 --> 44:53.240
you update.

44:53.240 --> 44:56.760
And there are, there are already some efforts for collaborative sorts of documentation.

44:56.760 --> 45:00.440
It would be interesting to see some of those prepackaged and sets you could maybe go grab,

45:00.440 --> 45:02.640
you know, Oh, I'm a, I'm a Ruby developer.

45:02.640 --> 45:06.200
Give me a set that has a bunch of common Ruby tools and away I go.

45:06.200 --> 45:08.000
Oh, I like that.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
Hmm.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
Hmm.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
All right guys.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.320
Well, like I said, it is a tight one today cause I have an, I have an appointment that

45:13.320 --> 45:14.600
I cannot miss.

45:14.600 --> 45:18.280
And so we're going to get out of here a little early today, but, uh, the, uh, unplugged show

45:18.280 --> 45:19.380
is live on Tuesdays.

45:19.380 --> 45:25.000
If you'd like to make it out next week, go to jblive.tv and it's, uh, also available

45:25.000 --> 45:29.160
in your local time at Jupiter broadcasting.com slash calendar.

45:29.160 --> 45:30.440
Go get more West Payne.

45:30.440 --> 45:32.920
He's on the TechSnap program, TechSnap.systems.

45:32.920 --> 45:33.920
Go get more Wimpy.

45:33.920 --> 45:34.920
He's on a Ubuntu podcast.

45:34.920 --> 45:35.920
Go get that.

45:35.920 --> 45:37.680
This Thursday sounds like it's going to be a great one.

45:37.680 --> 45:40.360
You can find Dan and Cassidy over at Elementary OS.

45:40.360 --> 45:44.420
We'll have their respective Twitter handles linked in our show notes and a big thank you

45:44.420 --> 45:48.280
to Thomas for coming on the show today and chatting with us about Academy.

45:48.280 --> 45:49.960
Much appreciated, Thomas, for that.

45:49.960 --> 45:53.440
So even though it's a little short today, we're going to wrap it up there.

45:53.440 --> 45:56.640
I'll leave you with just a couple of bits of wisdom.

45:56.640 --> 45:59.600
We would love to have you subscribe to the RSS feed if you're not already.

45:59.600 --> 46:03.680
You can go to linuxunplug.com to get links to all the stuff we talked about, specifically

46:03.680 --> 46:08.800
Linux Unplugged slash 263 for links that are specific to this episode.

46:08.800 --> 46:11.960
But while you're over there, you can go to the subscribe page and you can get all the

46:11.960 --> 46:14.600
different ways to get this here episode every week.

46:14.600 --> 46:15.600
And there's a lot of them.

46:15.600 --> 46:16.600
There are.

46:16.600 --> 46:18.160
There's different podcast directories and whatnot.

46:18.160 --> 46:22.080
We try to make it wherever you want to be so you can find all of those resources at

46:22.080 --> 46:24.600
linuxunplugged.com.

46:24.600 --> 46:26.200
In the meantime, we're out of here.

46:26.200 --> 46:27.920
I'm going to go get checked up.

46:27.920 --> 46:30.880
Wes is going to go surf the smog.

46:30.880 --> 46:34.080
And then that gives everyone plenty of time to prepare their questions for Ask Noah.

46:34.080 --> 46:35.080
That's right.

46:35.080 --> 46:54.500
Be safe out there.

46:54.500 --> 47:17.060
Oh, it's the Unplugged Show.

47:17.060 --> 47:18.060
The Unplugged Show.

47:18.060 --> 47:19.460
Well it was the Unplugged Show.

47:19.460 --> 47:20.460
Yo.

47:20.460 --> 47:21.460
Yeah it's all done now isn't it?

47:21.460 --> 47:23.540
I gotta, I gotta, I never sing on mic.

47:23.540 --> 47:26.080
I don't know it's like it's instinctual because I'm like sitting here fiddling with buttons

47:26.080 --> 47:27.780
and stuff and I'm, I can't help it.

47:27.780 --> 47:31.300
Next episode I'll just bring a little ukulele, you can back you up.

47:31.300 --> 47:32.300
We'll just embrace it.

47:32.300 --> 47:34.420
Get the unplugged band going.

47:34.420 --> 47:35.420
I like that idea.

47:35.420 --> 47:36.420
I like that.

47:36.420 --> 47:39.740
Well guys thank you for making it and it was really good to hear from all of you.

47:39.740 --> 47:40.740
Appreciate it very much.

47:40.740 --> 47:44.740
Sorry I had to cut it short this week but it's so hot in here it's actually not that

47:44.740 --> 47:45.740
bad.

47:45.740 --> 47:47.780
It's, if we're gonna cut it short this would be the week to do it I guess.

47:47.780 --> 47:48.780
Perfect.

47:48.780 --> 47:53.780
We'll see you next week.
