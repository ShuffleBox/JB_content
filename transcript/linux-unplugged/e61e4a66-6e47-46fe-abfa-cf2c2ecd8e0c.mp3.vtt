WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.360
We've got to get real, we've got to talk about something more important, and that's beer.

00:03.360 --> 00:05.800
And I want to know if you guys have seen Brewy.

00:05.800 --> 00:10.240
It's a fully automated brewing machine with a compact design that runs Linux, and yes

00:10.240 --> 00:13.720
this was one of my runs Linux, but I've got to talk to you, I've got to share it with

00:13.720 --> 00:14.720
you guys.

00:14.720 --> 00:20.880
Look at this, it's on IndieGoGo, $109,000 raised already of a goal of $100,000 with

00:20.880 --> 00:21.880
46 days left.

00:21.880 --> 00:26.840
So they're already at 109% with 46 days left, and I want to play this for you because this

00:26.840 --> 00:31.320
is the most magical machine ever invented by mankind, and I'm really excited.

00:31.320 --> 00:33.080
Until now.

00:33.080 --> 00:39.680
That's why we created Brewy, the first fully automated home brewery.

00:39.680 --> 00:45.280
Just place the ingredients into the machine, scan the RFID card that comes with the ingredients,

00:45.280 --> 00:46.280
and that's it.

00:46.280 --> 00:50.240
Brewy takes care of the rest, exactly like a master brewer would do.

00:50.240 --> 00:53.320
Brewy is perfect for beginners and experts alike.

00:53.320 --> 00:57.400
Experiment, modify recipes, or create new ones.

00:57.400 --> 01:01.520
Set the temperature for mashing and loitering, choose your own ingredients, set different

01:01.520 --> 01:06.860
times for adding hops, or choose one of the 23 other parameters for your brew.

01:06.860 --> 01:11.200
With Brewy, you can literally brew any kind of beer.

01:11.200 --> 01:15.320
Our system notifies you once your beer is ready, and you can drink it.

01:15.320 --> 01:16.320
Right on the phone.

01:16.320 --> 01:17.320
It's always online.

01:17.320 --> 01:22.120
You can control and monitor your brew by a phone, PC, or tablet, so you have time for

01:22.120 --> 01:25.040
other important things besides beer.

01:25.040 --> 01:29.240
Brewy also has an online recipe database where you can browse recipes and even create your

01:29.240 --> 01:30.240
own recipes.

01:30.240 --> 01:31.240
Are you seeing this?

01:31.240 --> 01:32.240
An online recipe database.

01:32.240 --> 01:33.240
You can save your favorite recipe and reproduce it any time.

01:33.240 --> 01:36.760
In some places, it is hard to connect with other brewers.

01:36.760 --> 01:40.680
That's why we've created a platform where you can share your experiences, exchange ideas.

01:40.680 --> 01:42.320
All right, so Blaster, what do you think?

01:42.320 --> 01:45.560
Do you want to go halfsies on this with me, because this is the most amazing invention

01:45.560 --> 01:49.260
of our lifetime, and I feel like we need to take advantage of this, and we could easily

01:49.260 --> 01:50.720
make it a show segment.

01:50.720 --> 01:51.720
Yes.

01:51.720 --> 01:52.720
Let's do this.

01:52.720 --> 01:53.720
All right.

01:53.720 --> 01:54.720
Okay, we're doing it.

01:54.720 --> 01:55.720
I think this is so cool.

01:55.720 --> 01:56.720
I'm really excited about it.

01:56.720 --> 01:57.720
It's called Brewy.

01:57.720 --> 01:58.720
Now, here's the problem.

01:58.720 --> 02:02.560
This is why we got to go halfsies, because maybe we want to go thirdsies, actually.

02:02.560 --> 02:06.720
The beginner pack, 15 out of 50 claimed, $1,500.

02:06.720 --> 02:07.720
Damn it.

02:07.720 --> 02:10.360
Yeah, I mean, this is a real... This is a big boy rig.

02:10.360 --> 02:11.360
This is the real deal, right?

02:11.360 --> 02:14.120
I mean, you're making a lot of beer out of this thing, okay?

02:14.120 --> 02:16.360
You're controlling it with your smartphone, and the damn thing runs on Linux.

02:16.360 --> 02:17.360
I mean, let's get real.

02:17.360 --> 02:18.360
Of course, it's $1,500.

02:18.360 --> 02:19.760
It should be more than that.

02:19.760 --> 02:20.760
Think about it.

02:20.760 --> 02:21.760
It runs on Linux.

02:21.760 --> 02:24.280
Let me tell you about some of the specs before you get a little scared away.

02:24.280 --> 02:26.400
It's got a 4.3 inch color LCD screen on the front.

02:26.400 --> 02:30.800
It has 802.11 BG and N, plus an RFID transceiver built in.

02:30.800 --> 02:32.800
It's got a USB port.

02:32.800 --> 02:35.680
This is a brewer, an automatic brewer, okay?

02:35.680 --> 02:39.560
It can hold 20 liters, 5.2 gallons for us yanks.

02:39.560 --> 02:43.980
Takes about five to six hours to brew, and then 14 days for fermentation.

02:43.980 --> 02:46.340
That's amazing, okay?

02:46.340 --> 02:48.520
That's worth $1,500 right there.

02:48.520 --> 02:49.520
Okay.

02:49.520 --> 02:52.880
It runs something called, and I'm not familiar with this, Pokey-based Linux.

02:52.880 --> 02:54.160
What the hell is Pokey-based Linux?

02:54.160 --> 02:58.600
I don't know, but you manage it from Android, iOS, Windows Phone, mobile apps, or just a

02:58.600 --> 03:01.120
generic web interface.

03:01.120 --> 03:08.920
It has magnetic valves with brushless pumps, stainless steel containers, 20,000 hour pumps,

03:08.920 --> 03:16.400
automatic water inlet, two, my friends, automatic hop inserters, okay?

03:16.400 --> 03:19.080
Solid state relay controls.

03:19.080 --> 03:21.080
I'm sorry.

03:21.080 --> 03:22.080
How could we not back this?

03:22.080 --> 03:26.200
I almost feel like it's so damn expensive, but this is the most... We got to get these

03:26.200 --> 03:27.200
people on the show.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.160
Rotten Corpse, you got to make a note about this.

03:29.160 --> 03:30.160
We got to get these people-

03:30.160 --> 03:31.160
Party now.

03:31.160 --> 03:32.160
Oh, you are.

03:32.160 --> 03:33.160
Yeah, we got to talk to these-

03:33.160 --> 03:34.160
He's on it.

03:34.160 --> 03:35.160
Maybe we can get a review unit.

03:35.160 --> 03:36.160
This is amazing.

03:36.160 --> 03:37.160
Okay.

03:37.160 --> 03:39.520
Would this bring back beer as tasty?

03:39.520 --> 03:40.520
We would have to.

03:40.520 --> 03:41.520
I mean, I think it would.

03:41.520 --> 03:42.520
Uh-huh.

03:42.520 --> 03:43.520
I think that would happen.

03:43.520 --> 03:44.680
See, they had early... See, I wish I would have jumped on this early, because they had

03:44.680 --> 03:47.260
$100,000 early bird packages.

03:47.260 --> 03:52.400
This would create a competition between the brewers at Linux Fest Northwest.

03:52.400 --> 03:53.400
Yeah.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.400
Yeah.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.400
Oh, here's the-

03:55.400 --> 03:56.400
Yeah, totally.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.400
Here's what we'd want, too.

03:57.400 --> 04:00.560
The unique skin package includes all the items of the professional package... Oh, a professional

04:00.560 --> 04:01.560
package, huh?

04:01.560 --> 04:02.560
That sounds like us, too.

04:02.560 --> 04:04.280
We're professionals, right?

04:04.280 --> 04:06.400
But you get to add your own logo to it.

04:06.400 --> 04:07.400
Come on, let's do this.

04:07.400 --> 04:09.680
We could put the Jupiter Broadcasting logo on there.

04:09.680 --> 04:14.220
But the professional package, check this out, includes a beginner package... Oh, hello.

04:14.220 --> 04:16.320
These accessories include a pH meter.

04:16.320 --> 04:17.320
Nice.

04:17.320 --> 04:18.440
Amazing.

04:18.440 --> 04:23.360
One measuring cylinder, one water quality testing instrument, and one ball and hydrometer.

04:23.360 --> 04:26.640
I don't think I'll say that right.

04:26.640 --> 04:28.320
This is really exciting.

04:28.320 --> 04:31.280
When beer and Linux come together, magic happens.

04:31.280 --> 04:33.480
So anyways, it's Brewery, and it's on IndieGoGo.

04:33.480 --> 04:35.360
Hey, those guys at Linux Fest proved that.

04:35.360 --> 04:37.280
Yeah, it's still got 46 days left, too.

04:37.280 --> 04:40.560
So if you want to fund that ass, there is a link in the show notes.

04:40.560 --> 04:44.640
Gosh, that's cool.

04:44.640 --> 04:46.400
I really, really want one.

04:46.400 --> 04:47.400
Man.

04:47.400 --> 04:49.120
I smell a revival of podcasts.

04:49.120 --> 04:52.480
You know, I tell you what, guys.

04:52.480 --> 04:58.800
The truth of the matter is... I'm not bitter, but if I had Leo Laporte money...

04:58.800 --> 05:00.920
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

05:00.920 --> 05:02.640
I would be just buying all kinds of crap.

05:02.640 --> 05:04.440
I would just be buying crap like that all the time.

05:04.440 --> 05:05.440
It does.

05:05.440 --> 05:06.440
Yeah.

05:06.440 --> 05:13.440
Well, it looks like they're based in Hungary, so regionally, they're closer to Popeye and

05:13.440 --> 05:17.520
Popeye, so I think you should have it sent to the UK and save on shipping expenses.

05:17.520 --> 05:18.520
I agree.

05:18.520 --> 05:19.520
All right.

05:19.520 --> 05:20.520
All right.

05:20.520 --> 05:21.520
Okay.

05:21.520 --> 05:27.640
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's filled with the holiday

05:27.640 --> 05:31.720
GNU spirit, well, and a little bit of Santa's rum.

05:31.720 --> 05:33.240
My name is Chris.

05:33.240 --> 05:34.240
My name is Matt.

05:34.240 --> 05:35.240
Hey there, Matt.

05:35.240 --> 05:38.520
So we got so much going on in today's episode.

05:38.520 --> 05:41.600
It's a little ridiculous, so I'm really excited.

05:41.600 --> 05:46.360
Coming up earlier on in the show, we're going to talk with Antibody from the Xenotic Project

05:46.360 --> 05:50.640
about something really cool coming up in my favorite open source game, but there's also

05:50.640 --> 05:54.280
some other news in gaming that we're going to get to for the holidays because there's

05:54.280 --> 05:58.220
probably going to be a big sale coming up, but later on in the show, Dustin Kirkland

05:58.220 --> 06:02.280
from Canonical comes back with some additional comments about Ubuntu Snappy potentially being

06:02.280 --> 06:06.760
the future of the Ubuntu project, so I'll ask him about that and we'll get his insights

06:06.760 --> 06:07.760
on that.

06:07.760 --> 06:13.880
So what the heck is Juju and how does it fit into the whole Ubuntu core thing?

06:13.880 --> 06:18.560
He'll answer that and what all the different packages are, and then later on in the show,

06:18.560 --> 06:22.000
it's our community review of Fedora 21.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.680
We're going to get everybody's opinion on how it's been since they've installed it.

06:24.680 --> 06:29.360
I'll give you some additional thoughts that I've had trying out Fedora 21, so it's a really,

06:29.360 --> 06:34.080
really big show, and on top of that, we got a whole bunch of feedback, Matt.

06:34.080 --> 06:36.200
It's a little cray, so why don't we get started?

06:36.200 --> 06:37.200
Let's clear the deck.

06:37.200 --> 06:42.800
Let's bring in the awesome mumble room, Goldfish, who I believe is here for his first time even

06:42.800 --> 06:43.800
for Linux Unplugged.

06:43.800 --> 06:44.840
All of you, welcome.

06:44.840 --> 06:46.640
Time appropriate greetings, mumble room.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.640
Hey.

06:47.640 --> 06:48.640
Hey.

06:48.640 --> 06:49.640
Hello.

06:49.640 --> 06:50.640
Hey.

06:50.640 --> 06:51.640
Hi.

06:51.640 --> 06:52.640
Hi.

06:52.640 --> 06:53.640
Hello, hello.

06:53.640 --> 06:54.640
It sounds like there's like three of you.

06:54.640 --> 06:55.640
You guys got to get better at that.

06:55.640 --> 06:56.640
You got to really represent.

06:56.640 --> 06:59.520
All right, so let's get started here.

06:59.520 --> 07:03.720
Yesterday, before we go too much further here, yesterday we had something kind of exciting

07:03.720 --> 07:05.360
happen.

07:05.360 --> 07:10.600
We launched on the Quota Radio Show an open source project right here on the Jupiter Broadcasting

07:10.600 --> 07:18.580
Network, GPL2, and I believe it may prove to fundamentally be the most important project

07:18.580 --> 07:21.840
for 2015 of all open source projects, Matt.

07:21.840 --> 07:22.840
Whoa.

07:22.840 --> 07:23.840
Yeah.

07:23.840 --> 07:24.840
Oh, yeah, yeah.

07:24.840 --> 07:28.320
Yeah, it's called Open Your Mouth, and it's at OpenYourMouth.recipes.

07:28.320 --> 07:33.440
These are open source GPL2-licensed recipes from the Jupiter Broadcasting Community.

07:33.440 --> 07:37.960
This is an opportunity to go out there and meet your fellow Jupiter Broadcasting developer,

07:37.960 --> 07:43.880
learn a little GitHub and Markdown in the process, and commit your recipes to one central

07:43.880 --> 07:44.880
place, OpenYourMouth.

07:44.880 --> 07:47.760
We've set it up, OpenYourMouth.recipes.com.

07:47.760 --> 07:52.440
It's open source recipes from the Jupiter Broadcasting Community, and it's actually,

07:52.440 --> 07:54.400
you know, it's kind of amazing.

07:54.400 --> 07:55.640
It's taking off in a big way.

07:55.640 --> 08:00.960
We've got breakfast, desserts, pizzas, sandwiches, sauces, different types of these things.

08:00.960 --> 08:04.240
And Matt, this is already a huge hit.

08:04.240 --> 08:05.240
That's awesome.

08:05.240 --> 08:06.240
I love it.

08:06.240 --> 08:07.240
So go to OpenYourMouth.recipes.

08:07.240 --> 08:08.240
OpenYourMouth.recipes.

08:08.240 --> 08:09.240
Okay.

08:09.240 --> 08:10.240
And Rekai's been in there.

08:10.240 --> 08:16.080
He's been engaging with the community, and right now they're working on a pretty killer

08:16.080 --> 08:19.000
barbecue pizza, and they've merged in some of the changes.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.860
Everything's written down in Markdown, so if you just want to go look at the recipe,

08:21.860 --> 08:23.480
you can read them.

08:23.480 --> 08:27.240
And here's what we were thinking.

08:27.240 --> 08:33.160
We talk a lot about open source code and community and all of that, but I realize there are hundreds

08:33.160 --> 08:37.960
of developers that listen to these shows that are not talking to each other, that run into

08:37.960 --> 08:38.960
jams.

08:38.960 --> 08:42.060
You know, they get into a spot where they're stuck and they need a resource.

08:42.060 --> 08:45.240
They're not communicating, even though they're all listening to the same content.

08:45.240 --> 08:51.680
Wouldn't it be cool if we could create a fun, sort of no pressure way for people to connect,

08:51.680 --> 08:55.520
maybe even for folks that are not familiar with GitHub, maybe folks that want to learn

08:55.520 --> 09:02.040
Markdown or just connect with a community that's pretty cool, but not have to know code.

09:02.040 --> 09:04.680
And that's what we've done here.

09:04.680 --> 09:08.760
It's tongue-in-cheek, but it's also a serious attempt to give people a way to connect.

09:08.760 --> 09:13.360
Also we're encouraging people to hang out in our Jupyter Dev chat room.

09:13.360 --> 09:17.000
We have a dedicated JB Dev chat room on Geek Shed.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.960
In fact, if you want to know more about any of this, we've got a whole bunch of projects

09:20.960 --> 09:23.000
going on for the community to work on right now.

09:23.000 --> 09:29.440
If you're interested in developing code for the Jupyter Broadcasting Network, go to jbdev.community.

09:29.440 --> 09:34.560
Blaster set that up for us, jbdev.community, and it will give you a link of resources,

09:34.560 --> 09:39.360
all of them right there, like different account information, the IRC info.

09:39.360 --> 09:42.120
Well hello there, hello there.

09:42.120 --> 09:46.800
And that's a great place to start also, Jupyter Dev on the IRC is another place to start.

09:46.800 --> 09:49.320
And it's really kind of fun to see people work on this.

09:49.320 --> 09:53.680
We're launching a lot of projects in 2015, and so we're trying to get people engaged

09:53.680 --> 09:56.200
and that's kind of just a fun way to start.

09:56.200 --> 09:59.600
And it turns out, some pretty good recipes.

09:59.600 --> 10:03.360
We started it yesterday and now there's more than a dozen, I think it's actually a lot

10:03.360 --> 10:04.360
more than that.

10:04.360 --> 10:06.360
I like how bacon's at the top.

10:06.360 --> 10:08.760
Oh Matt, yeah.

10:08.760 --> 10:09.760
Let's not kid ourselves.

10:09.760 --> 10:14.000
And Angel and I want to submit some of our own recipes from the Fisher family.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.720
And then before we get into our feedback, which I got a great one, I'm really glad,

10:17.720 --> 10:20.720
so this is the last Linux Unplugged before Christmas.

10:20.720 --> 10:24.280
Next week we will have a new episode, but it is a best of episode.

10:24.280 --> 10:29.140
However, right now, Linux Unplugged has the least submissions for best ofs, and I know

10:29.140 --> 10:30.320
we've had some great moments.

10:30.320 --> 10:33.960
We've had some great arguments, we've had some great interviews, we've had some, we've

10:33.960 --> 10:36.640
had like, there's some stuff we've already got on the list.

10:36.640 --> 10:41.840
Like when Wimpy released the Ubuntu Mate 14.04 live on the show, how do you top that?

10:41.840 --> 10:43.080
Like that's already on our list.

10:43.080 --> 10:44.280
But we still need your help.

10:44.280 --> 10:47.640
At the top of the show notes, your best of submissions.

10:47.640 --> 10:51.760
Linux Unplugged, for some reason, has the least amount of submissions right now.

10:51.760 --> 10:54.660
Now come on, we all love the Unplugged show, right?

10:54.660 --> 10:58.560
So hook us up with your submissions, go over there, you'll find a link at the top of the

10:58.560 --> 11:01.500
show notes if you go look at episode 71 of Linux Unplugged.

11:01.500 --> 11:05.120
We just need the episode title, a link to the episode, the time code, and what it was.

11:05.120 --> 11:09.120
And then Rekai, see the thing is, what we're trying to do here is we're trying to give

11:09.120 --> 11:12.120
everybody time off, but the problem is we don't get these submissions in.

11:12.120 --> 11:17.960
I'm afraid Rekai might start pulling the hair out of his beard, and he has a beautiful beard,

11:17.960 --> 11:19.440
and I do not want to see that happen.

11:19.440 --> 11:20.440
Right?

11:20.440 --> 11:23.920
I mean, could you imagine, Matt, if he starts tearing it, that thing's a masterpiece.

11:23.920 --> 11:24.920
Oh my goodness.

11:24.920 --> 11:28.360
I picture him chasing us around the studio with like beard particles in hand, just screaming.

11:28.360 --> 11:29.360
Yeah, absolutely.

11:29.360 --> 11:34.080
When you have a content catalog as deep as ours, and the shows that are as long as they

11:34.080 --> 11:39.840
are, it is the most, just assembling a best of, just all of the formatting that goes into

11:39.840 --> 11:43.520
that is an incredible task, but he really could use your help, and we have links at

11:43.520 --> 11:44.520
the top of the show notes.

11:44.520 --> 11:46.160
You literally have like just a few hours.

11:46.160 --> 11:51.040
So if you're listening to this show now, please go do it, because it takes days and days and

11:51.040 --> 11:55.260
days and days of work just for one single episode, and he's working on them already.

11:55.260 --> 11:56.260
He's already started.

11:56.260 --> 11:58.480
All right, let's get into our first bit of feedback.

11:58.480 --> 12:05.480
KZ650 sent a frequent chatter, emails into the show about IPFire, and this was an email

12:05.480 --> 12:09.760
that I was really glad to get in towards the end of 2014, because earlier in the year,

12:09.760 --> 12:15.360
I had decided Chris is going to replace the firewalls both at JBHQ, which is where the

12:15.360 --> 12:19.880
operations happen, and JB1 Studios, which is where the production happens.

12:19.880 --> 12:21.920
At both ends, I wanted to replace the firewalls.

12:21.920 --> 12:25.780
My leading candidate for replacing those firewalls was PFSense, but the thing is PFSense runs

12:25.780 --> 12:30.160
on FreeBSD, and I didn't really want to deploy FreeBSD when I do this other show called the

12:30.160 --> 12:31.240
Linux Action Show.

12:31.240 --> 12:33.580
Just didn't feel right.

12:33.580 --> 12:37.760
So I was looking around for suggestions on what I could use instead, and I still haven't

12:37.760 --> 12:39.080
really come to a conclusion.

12:39.080 --> 12:45.320
Colonel Linux thinks I should use these MicroTik routers that look pretty compelling, and he's

12:45.320 --> 12:52.280
even so far into it, he's even sent me two of them now to make sure I deploy them.

12:52.280 --> 12:56.860
And then on the other end, I've looked at a few other distributions to see if something

12:56.860 --> 13:01.680
met my needs, and I wasn't really happy with any of them until KZ650 sent emails in about

13:01.680 --> 13:02.680
IPFire.

13:02.680 --> 13:07.400
He says, Chris and Matt, you've mentioned in the past about the epicness of PFSense.

13:07.400 --> 13:11.600
You talk about it all the time on TechSnap even, but you've never mentioned IPFire.

13:11.600 --> 13:15.680
After using several firewall distros, I landed on IPFire, and it's awesome.

13:15.680 --> 13:18.520
It's a very good project, and it deserves a spotlight.

13:18.520 --> 13:23.060
So I went and checked it out, Matt, and it totally, well, it basically kind of looks

13:23.060 --> 13:24.060
like PFSense.

13:24.060 --> 13:28.720
You download the ISO, and it is a dedicated firewall distribution, and you can get a nice

13:28.720 --> 13:31.320
gooey on top of that to manage your firewall rules.

13:31.320 --> 13:32.960
And it looks really nice.

13:32.960 --> 13:35.020
So I'm going to take a look at IPFire.

13:35.020 --> 13:39.080
Right now, I'm leaning towards the Microtech routers, or whatever they're called.

13:39.080 --> 13:41.560
Colonel X, do you have any thoughts on this?

13:41.560 --> 13:42.560
Are you listening?

13:42.560 --> 13:43.560
No.

13:43.560 --> 13:44.640
We know he's got thoughts on it.

13:44.640 --> 13:45.640
I'm sure he does.

13:45.640 --> 13:46.640
Hey, I do have thoughts.

13:46.640 --> 13:47.640
Here's the thing.

13:47.640 --> 13:51.800
For me, and I've done a lot of soul searching over the past couple years, and I think what

13:51.800 --> 13:54.560
I've come down to is it comes down to this.

13:54.560 --> 13:58.020
My first priority is that something runs on Linux, whether or not it's open source, whether

13:58.020 --> 14:01.560
or not it's, I don't mind paying for something, like Steam is a perfect example.

14:01.560 --> 14:04.720
I'll pay for it, and it's not open source, but it runs perfectly on Linux.

14:04.720 --> 14:06.680
So that's my, like, that's my bare line.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.900
And then after that, if it's open source, even better.

14:08.900 --> 14:12.960
And after that, if it's true free software, foundation, specialty stuff, even better.

14:12.960 --> 14:14.960
That's like double, double better, yeah.

14:14.960 --> 14:15.960
Right.

14:15.960 --> 14:18.480
But with the Microtech, it meets that very bottom line.

14:18.480 --> 14:22.080
Everything works perfectly on Linux, which I can't say is the same for Cisco.

14:22.080 --> 14:24.840
And I can do all the stuff that I could do on the Microtechs that I used to be able to

14:24.840 --> 14:28.360
do on Cisco, except it all works on Linux, oh, and by the way, it's like a tenth of

14:28.360 --> 14:29.360
the price.

14:29.360 --> 14:30.360
Yeah.

14:30.360 --> 14:31.360
All right.

14:31.360 --> 14:32.360
I mean, and I like their size, too.

14:32.360 --> 14:33.360
So it's something I'm going to figure out soon.

14:33.360 --> 14:34.360
I got to get this solved.

14:34.360 --> 14:35.560
I got to get this problem worked out.

14:35.560 --> 14:41.280
I've got a mess right now where my home network and the studio network are using the same

14:41.280 --> 14:45.360
IP address space, so it screws the hell out of my devices when I move between them.

14:45.360 --> 14:48.680
I cannot manage them remotely when I'm at one location or the other.

14:48.680 --> 14:53.480
I feel like I'm in the 1990s where TCP IP is this new thing that's really neat that I'm

14:53.480 --> 14:56.400
trying out, but I still prefer IPX.

14:56.400 --> 15:00.560
So yeah, this is a problem I've got to solve seriously in early January or else I think

15:00.560 --> 15:02.360
my blood pressure will suffer.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.040
All right.

15:04.040 --> 15:06.400
I'll tell you what doesn't make my blood pressure suffer.

15:06.400 --> 15:10.000
I'll tell you what makes me feel a little bit better, and that's personal accomplishments,

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
seriously.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.920
And that's why Linux Academy is a great sponsor for Linux Unplugged.

15:13.920 --> 15:14.920
I can go there.

15:14.920 --> 15:15.920
I can challenge myself.

15:15.920 --> 15:17.360
I can see what interests me.

15:17.360 --> 15:21.760
And I know that Linux Academy is built by people who truly understand and know Linux.

15:21.760 --> 15:23.440
They are Linux users themselves.

15:23.440 --> 15:25.360
They're not generic educators.

15:25.360 --> 15:29.120
They don't have everything from fixing the sink to setting up an Apache server.

15:29.120 --> 15:31.680
They're people that genuinely love and use Linux themselves.

15:31.680 --> 15:36.280
Educators, Linux users, system administrators, developers that came together and they created

15:36.280 --> 15:39.480
something they're passionate about, and that's Linux Academy.

15:39.480 --> 15:45.080
And if you go to linuxacademy.com.plugged, you'll get a 33% discount, and that's for

15:45.080 --> 15:46.080
the lifetime right there.

15:46.080 --> 15:47.080
Boom.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.320
Actually, I think it's for the quarter.

15:48.320 --> 15:49.320
Go over there and check it out.

15:49.320 --> 15:51.240
Go to linuxacademy.com.plugged.

15:51.240 --> 15:53.500
Try them out for a little while and see what the discount is.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.040
It's 33% off.

15:55.040 --> 15:58.120
That's if you think about it, sort of an amazing discount.

15:58.120 --> 16:00.720
They have everything you'd want to learn, seriously.

16:00.720 --> 16:03.680
Everything from doing your own backups to managing your own Linux servers.

16:03.680 --> 16:06.480
You can choose from 7 plus Linux distributions that automatically adjust the course.

16:06.480 --> 16:10.000
If you're in DevOps, if you're learning about OpenStack, if you're learning about Docker,

16:10.000 --> 16:11.560
they've got courses on that.

16:11.560 --> 16:13.480
They're always adding new content constantly.

16:13.480 --> 16:19.180
In fact, they just wrapped up the puppet professional courses from beginner to puppet professional

16:19.180 --> 16:21.840
to be certified ready at Linux Academy.

16:21.840 --> 16:24.120
Vagrant, they've got courses on that.

16:24.120 --> 16:26.020
Docker, courses on that.

16:26.020 --> 16:29.680
They're on top of all of this stuff because they're Linux enthusiasts themselves, so they

16:29.680 --> 16:32.000
are following the technology trends.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.800
They're following the open source developments.

16:34.800 --> 16:40.840
They're watching all of this, and then they're curating the courseware based on that.

16:40.840 --> 16:42.880
Nobody else can offer that.

16:42.880 --> 16:44.840
Linuxacademy.com.plugged.

16:44.840 --> 16:45.840
Go there.

16:45.840 --> 16:46.840
Check it out.

16:46.840 --> 16:47.840
Sign up.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.400
I've been using them now for months.

16:49.400 --> 16:54.380
It's seriously one of the best online learning tools I've ever seen in many years.

16:54.380 --> 16:59.440
I go back to years when it required some clunky ActiveX installer.

16:59.440 --> 17:01.640
It was the worst of the worst.

17:01.640 --> 17:06.640
It was like, here Chris, we have bought you this as part of your educational package for

17:06.640 --> 17:08.200
working here.

17:08.200 --> 17:11.240
This is the course you can take, and it was the worst.

17:11.240 --> 17:13.760
Linux Academy is nothing like that.

17:13.760 --> 17:17.100
They have learning plans where you can go in and tell them how much time you have available.

17:17.100 --> 17:21.960
They'll automatically create courseware based on that time availability with reminders and

17:21.960 --> 17:27.520
quizzes and self-checks, and they also have a community that's available to you.

17:27.520 --> 17:30.960
And I think one of the best things about Linux Academy is the way that they automatically

17:30.960 --> 17:34.560
spin up virtual machines on demand that match the courseware.

17:34.560 --> 17:35.880
They give you remote access to them.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.320
You log in over SSH.

17:37.320 --> 17:40.500
You actually work with the technology you're learning about.

17:40.500 --> 17:44.580
You can download the comprehensive study guides, bring them with you on the phone, treat

17:44.580 --> 17:50.000
them as podcasts, be like Skookiesprite, listen to them in the shower.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.280
This is a really great opportunity, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

17:54.280 --> 17:57.540
They also have added a lot of DevOps content in the past few months because that's an area

17:57.540 --> 18:02.120
that's really growing, and they've really doubled down on it, linuxacademy.com slash

18:02.120 --> 18:03.120
unplugged.

18:03.120 --> 18:07.560
And a huge thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program.

18:07.560 --> 18:14.320
You guys, like almost every week, you guys have something new for me to talk about, and

18:14.320 --> 18:19.120
that is truly a treat, and it is really neat, and it's really awesome to watch them work.

18:19.120 --> 18:20.480
I feel a bit of a kinship with them.

18:20.480 --> 18:25.560
I feel like if Jupyter Broadcasting were to start today, maybe I might go this direction.

18:25.560 --> 18:29.680
And they are truly advocating and spreading the use of Linux by making it accessible to

18:29.680 --> 18:33.440
learn to everybody, from experts to beginners.

18:33.440 --> 18:37.780
I think they're one of the best sponsors we've ever had, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

18:37.780 --> 18:41.880
Go check them out, and a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged

18:41.880 --> 18:42.880
program.

18:42.880 --> 18:43.920
All right.

18:43.920 --> 18:48.360
So I wanted to start with some, let's start with a bang, literally.

18:48.360 --> 18:50.000
Why don't we talk with Antibody.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.760
Antibody is joining us in the mumble room.

18:51.760 --> 18:53.480
We have an open mumble room, and you're welcome to join us.

18:53.480 --> 18:54.920
We just do a mic check.

18:54.920 --> 18:58.300
He's joining us from the Xenotic Project, my favorite first person shooter.

18:58.300 --> 18:59.300
It's open source.

18:59.300 --> 19:03.580
We often talk about Steam games, and I'm delighted when we get a chance to talk about a genuine

19:03.580 --> 19:04.940
open source game.

19:04.940 --> 19:06.880
So Antibody, welcome to Linux Unplugged.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.540
How are you doing today, sir?

19:08.540 --> 19:09.640
I'm doing great, Chris.

19:09.640 --> 19:10.640
Thanks for having me.

19:10.640 --> 19:11.640
Absolutely.

19:11.640 --> 19:15.960
So, you know me, we've had a Xenotic server for quite a while.

19:15.960 --> 19:20.680
I've been a player of Xenotic for quite a bit, but a little birdie told me there's something

19:20.680 --> 19:23.240
new in the works coming up in the near future.

19:23.240 --> 19:24.640
Yes, indeed.

19:24.640 --> 19:28.720
That little birdie is correct, and thanks for running a server, by the way.

19:28.720 --> 19:34.880
I didn't get the chance to check your server ID to sport you some nice stats, but yeah,

19:34.880 --> 19:39.720
the little birdie says that there's going to be a release quote unquote soon.

19:39.720 --> 19:40.720
Very soon.

19:40.720 --> 19:43.200
Maybe even before the new year?

19:43.200 --> 19:44.200
Like maybe.

19:44.200 --> 19:49.120
You know, this is an open source project, and we have like a gazillion developers from

19:49.120 --> 19:51.480
around the world, so we got to herd the cats.

19:51.480 --> 19:52.480
You know what I mean?

19:52.480 --> 19:53.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:53.480 --> 19:56.360
So what kind of things, and when this new release does land, what kind of things are

19:56.360 --> 19:57.840
we looking forward to?

19:57.840 --> 20:00.920
Okay, so drum roll please.

20:00.920 --> 20:01.920
Wait for it.

20:01.920 --> 20:02.920
Wait for it.

20:02.920 --> 20:03.920
Okay, no.

20:03.920 --> 20:05.960
So Xenotic's getting a new weapon, actually.

20:05.960 --> 20:11.560
The long-awaited ARC is going to be arriving, well actually has arrived in Master if you

20:11.560 --> 20:12.880
run a git.

20:12.880 --> 20:20.960
But to the ARC, if you are from the Quake slash genre of shooters, ARC is like the lightning

20:20.960 --> 20:21.960
gun.

20:21.960 --> 20:22.960
Right?

20:22.960 --> 20:23.960
Yes.

20:23.960 --> 20:24.960
Oh my gosh, I love that gun.

20:24.960 --> 20:30.000
We're working on some really, really cool audio effects at the moment, get it to echo

20:30.000 --> 20:33.480
and sound like really powerful, really meaty, you know?

20:33.480 --> 20:34.480
Yeah.

20:34.480 --> 20:39.160
And other dudes, so we've got three new official maps, we're focusing on the capture the flag

20:39.160 --> 20:43.960
game mode, so we have three official new maps for that.

20:43.960 --> 20:50.040
We have a very active developer in Mario who's developed this really neat little system that

20:50.040 --> 20:51.560
he calls buffs.

20:51.560 --> 20:59.240
And so it's not like your little strength or shield type power-ups, they're more wacky.

20:59.240 --> 21:04.520
So you get this so-called buff, it's like a hovering little coin thing, right?

21:04.520 --> 21:08.320
And then suddenly you can fly, or suddenly you can move really fast.

21:08.320 --> 21:09.320
Oh, really?

21:09.320 --> 21:14.860
So we've got a bunch of little variety, a little potpourri, if you will, into the game.

21:14.860 --> 21:19.440
So tell me, so give me a little background for folks that are not familiar.

21:19.440 --> 21:23.880
Xenotic is a first-person shooter, you can set up your own server, am I correct when

21:23.880 --> 21:27.840
I say it's based on the Quake 3 engine, or is that wrong?

21:27.840 --> 21:32.800
It is actually based on Quake 1, but it's like uber-modified.

21:32.800 --> 21:38.680
I would say it looks amazing for that.

21:38.680 --> 21:43.240
It's basically like taking the core engine out of a game and stripping it all the way

21:43.240 --> 21:47.700
down, building it back up with some kind of more realistic expectations.

21:47.700 --> 21:53.400
We're not going to pretend that we're a state-of-the-art engine, but it's pretty darn spiffy.

21:53.400 --> 21:56.960
It seems like it, I would say, here's how I would rate the graphics.

21:56.960 --> 22:02.560
It's still rewarding on a higher Nvidia class card, but it's still playable on, say, the

22:02.560 --> 22:07.600
Iris graphics, which is a pretty great range, and it also means it's pretty playable on

22:07.600 --> 22:09.920
a lot of the open-source drivers, right?

22:09.920 --> 22:14.120
Absolutely, it's playable on your open-source drivers, and more than just playable, it's

22:14.120 --> 22:15.280
really configurable.

22:15.280 --> 22:21.080
So we have people running it off of, like, I personally have an Acer Revo that runs Xenotic

22:21.080 --> 22:24.440
just fine off of a little teeny Atom processor.

22:24.440 --> 22:25.440
Very cool.

22:25.440 --> 22:32.000
Well, so we should be checking out Xenotic.org, X-O-N-O-T-I-C.org, maybe around the New Year's

22:32.000 --> 22:33.960
timeframe around in that area?

22:33.960 --> 22:40.680
Yeah, in that general vicinity, yeah, and look for the new maps, look for the new weapon.

22:40.680 --> 22:44.360
We got a nice tiered server browser.

22:44.360 --> 22:48.160
Before we would just kind of slap you with all the servers, a ginormous list that you

22:48.160 --> 22:49.160
had to parse through.

22:49.160 --> 22:52.280
Well, and I'm looking at the servers, I'm looking at the most active servers, and it's

22:52.280 --> 22:57.040
very disappointing, Jupiter Broadcasting, which was once at number one, is now falling to

22:57.040 --> 22:58.160
number 25.

22:58.160 --> 23:02.400
So if you guys go out there and install Xenotic, join the Jupiter Broadcasting last Xenotic

23:02.400 --> 23:04.600
server and get that number back up there.

23:04.600 --> 23:07.120
We used to rank it, so I think we can do it again.

23:07.120 --> 23:08.120
Yeah, come on, guys.

23:08.120 --> 23:09.120
Yeah, right?

23:09.120 --> 23:10.120
Get fragging.

23:10.120 --> 23:12.240
So Antibody, you do me a solid and come back on the show when the new release comes out,

23:12.240 --> 23:15.080
and maybe we'll do a little live gameplay and the mumble room can shoot each other and

23:15.080 --> 23:16.080
all that?

23:16.080 --> 23:17.080
Absolutely.

23:17.080 --> 23:20.400
I would love to personally frag you, Chris.

23:20.400 --> 23:25.960
I'll hover, you know, my right index finger.

23:25.960 --> 23:26.960
It's really itchy.

23:26.960 --> 23:27.960
All right.

23:27.960 --> 23:28.960
You know what I'm saying?

23:28.960 --> 23:29.960
All right.

23:29.960 --> 23:30.960
It's really itchy.

23:30.960 --> 23:31.960
Fair enough.

23:31.960 --> 23:32.960
You know what?

23:32.960 --> 23:33.960
I will take it.

23:33.960 --> 23:34.960
I will take it.

23:34.960 --> 23:35.960
I will.

23:35.960 --> 23:36.960
I am horrible at games.

23:36.960 --> 23:37.960
But all right.

23:37.960 --> 23:38.960
I'm an old man.

23:38.960 --> 23:42.400
So before we get out of the feedback segment, and thanks to Antibody for coming on and talking

23:42.400 --> 23:47.680
about that, I wanted to send out a request to the audience to get their feedback on Wallbag.

23:47.680 --> 23:48.680
What?

23:48.680 --> 23:49.680
Yeah.

23:49.680 --> 23:50.680
Wallbag.

23:50.680 --> 23:51.680
Wallbag.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.200
And maybe if anybody in the mumble room has any experience with Wallbag, I'd love to hear

23:53.200 --> 23:54.200
about this.

23:54.200 --> 23:58.840
But I've recently talked about on Linux Action Show this Sunday how I use Instapaper to read

23:58.840 --> 24:00.440
long form articles.

24:00.440 --> 24:05.040
And in Instapaper, I have the open dyslexic font configured.

24:05.040 --> 24:10.080
Now there is an alternative to Instapaper that is open source that you could host yourself

24:10.080 --> 24:12.360
even called Wallbag.

24:12.360 --> 24:13.680
And it does the same thing.

24:13.680 --> 24:17.520
It goes, it's like an offline stash where you can read stuff later.

24:17.520 --> 24:22.180
The thing is, is I don't know what the end reading experience is like with Wallbag.

24:22.180 --> 24:24.500
But because this is something I do a lot for our shows.

24:24.500 --> 24:27.920
When I'm in the middle of something and I see an article that's relevant to our shows,

24:27.920 --> 24:31.600
but it's going to take me more than a few minutes to read, I send it to Instapaper and

24:31.600 --> 24:33.800
then I go offline later and I read it all.

24:33.800 --> 24:37.200
And so Wallbag would be, it's something I could put on a DigitalOcean droplet.

24:37.200 --> 24:38.880
It's something that could be under my control.

24:38.880 --> 24:40.260
And you know how I'm all for that.

24:40.260 --> 24:42.360
But I have no idea what the experience is like.

24:42.360 --> 24:46.400
And I'm putting a request out there to the audience to go over to the contact form and

24:46.400 --> 24:48.520
send in their feedback or in the subreddit.

24:48.520 --> 24:51.840
And I wonder if anybody in the mumble room has any experience with Wallbag.

24:51.840 --> 24:52.840
No.

24:52.840 --> 24:53.840
Negative.

24:53.840 --> 24:54.840
Negative?

24:54.840 --> 24:55.840
Okay.

24:55.840 --> 24:56.840
No.

24:56.840 --> 24:59.760
Yeah, I really hadn't heard a lot about it either.

24:59.760 --> 25:04.280
But I've seen it for a long time and so I'll put my feelers out there.

25:04.280 --> 25:05.560
We'll see what happens.

25:05.560 --> 25:08.840
And maybe somebody out there has tried it and they can send us in their feedback.

25:08.840 --> 25:09.840
Oh!

25:09.840 --> 25:10.840
Oh!

25:10.840 --> 25:11.840
You hear that?

25:11.840 --> 25:12.840
Oh!

25:12.840 --> 25:13.840
Oh!

25:13.840 --> 25:16.760
Oh, I think it's time for a little Steam update too.

25:16.760 --> 25:21.640
So speaking of, before we get away from gaming completely, super quick here, Boiling Steam

25:21.640 --> 25:26.000
has a great post on a proper end of year of gaming on Linux.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.280
And there's been some recent releases that are really big deals for Linux.

25:29.280 --> 25:32.600
And we won't spend a lot of time on this, I know not all of you are big gamers.

25:32.600 --> 25:37.080
But for those of you that are gamers, there's some holiday sales coming up and there's some

25:37.080 --> 25:38.120
great games that have come out.

25:38.120 --> 25:43.200
A Metro 23 Redux has relaunched and this is the rebuilt version that has a lot better

25:43.200 --> 25:44.200
textures.

25:44.200 --> 25:46.920
Linux Gamecast just did a review on that if you want to check that out.

25:46.920 --> 25:51.400
For you football fans, Football Manager 2015 is out.

25:51.400 --> 25:55.200
Some games that we weren't expecting, Empire Total War, and this has gotten some serious

25:55.200 --> 25:56.680
traction in our subreddit.

25:56.680 --> 26:02.920
Geometry Wars 3 is an Aspire port, which Aspire has done all good work so far and it's a great

26:02.920 --> 26:03.920
game.

26:03.920 --> 26:06.480
I had my friend John just totally consumed by it.

26:06.480 --> 26:10.320
War Thunder, it's an MMO shooter, which looks really fun.

26:10.320 --> 26:13.400
And Counter Strike Global Offensive, of course, we've given mention to.

26:13.400 --> 26:16.840
Also expected before the end of the year, Civilization Beyond Earth.

26:16.840 --> 26:19.160
So there's a lot of really good games.

26:19.160 --> 26:22.480
Zonotic obviously an open source option that's really great.

26:22.480 --> 26:27.080
And if you are thinking about picking up some Steam games, I just want to, just a quick

26:27.080 --> 26:32.940
PSA to remind you, try to buy them under the Linux Steam client so that way the Linux sale

26:32.940 --> 26:33.940
is counted.

26:33.940 --> 26:36.080
I'm not sure what happens if you buy it on the web.

26:36.080 --> 26:39.840
And even if you buy it on a Windows machine and then play it under Linux, at least for

26:39.840 --> 26:43.520
two weeks, that sale is going to be counted towards Windows.

26:43.520 --> 26:48.440
So if you can, make these purchases as the Steam holiday sale comes up on your Linux

26:48.440 --> 26:51.840
rig as sort of a vote for supporting Linux.

26:51.840 --> 26:56.840
Just something to remind people about as we get close to the crazy ass rape your wallet

26:56.840 --> 27:01.120
Steam sale that comes up where I feel like Gabe personally comes into my house, knocks

27:01.120 --> 27:06.920
everything over, breaks all my piggy banks, and takes all of my money.

27:06.920 --> 27:08.480
It's a holly jolly time of year.

27:08.480 --> 27:12.760
And then yells at the top of his lungs, you're welcome.

27:12.760 --> 27:14.800
You wanted this!

27:14.800 --> 27:20.840
Alright so we had Dustin Kirkland come on the show and I asked him some questions pertaining

27:20.840 --> 27:23.280
to the future of the Ubuntu project.

27:23.280 --> 27:25.360
So we're going to play that here in just a second.

27:25.360 --> 27:29.980
It's some extra stuff that didn't make it into our last review.

27:29.980 --> 27:32.680
And I don't know, I think it could make for a great desktop.

27:32.680 --> 27:34.560
I think it's a pretty compelling option.

27:34.560 --> 27:36.520
I'll play his answer and we'll talk about it.

27:36.520 --> 27:38.720
But first I want to mention DigitalOcean.

27:38.720 --> 27:42.900
Head over to DigitalOcean.com right now and let's give the Linux Unplugged show a great

27:42.900 --> 27:45.160
end of 2014 showing.

27:45.160 --> 27:50.040
Use the promo code UnpluggedDecember when you actually just apply it to your account.

27:50.040 --> 27:52.840
It's a habit to say when you check out, but it's actually you can apply the balance to

27:52.840 --> 27:56.680
your account even after you've signed up if you forgot to use it.

27:56.680 --> 27:59.340
UnpluggedDecember will give you a $10 credit for DigitalOcean.

27:59.340 --> 28:03.420
Now we've talked about DigitalOcean for a long, long time.

28:03.420 --> 28:10.380
And it really is one of the coolest resources and one of the coolest manifestations of different

28:10.380 --> 28:15.080
Linux technologies that has been put into a product that is also extremely awesome for

28:15.080 --> 28:16.160
Linux users to use.

28:16.160 --> 28:17.160
So what is it?

28:17.160 --> 28:20.520
If you're not familiar, DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to

28:20.520 --> 28:24.900
offering the most intuitive and easy way to spin up a cloud server.

28:24.900 --> 28:26.800
Now why does that matter?

28:26.800 --> 28:31.740
Well that matters because if it's super simple and straightforward for you to set up, not

28:31.740 --> 28:36.940
a hobbled system, but a system that you have full access, full control over, that you can

28:36.940 --> 28:39.500
deploy applications to with one click.

28:39.500 --> 28:44.860
And if that process of setting that up just takes mere moments or can even be scripted,

28:44.860 --> 28:47.320
that fundamentally changes it.

28:47.320 --> 28:51.980
Removing all of that friction is a huge deal and DigitalOcean saw that and they realized

28:51.980 --> 28:56.180
that's why the UI was super important and then they built it on top of SSD drives way

28:56.180 --> 29:00.640
before anybody else was doing SSD and of course they had to pair it with tier one bandwidth.

29:00.640 --> 29:04.380
And you can get started in less than a minute and pricing plans start at only five dollars

29:04.380 --> 29:05.380
a month.

29:05.380 --> 29:08.860
So if you use our promo code unplugdecember with that ten dollar credit, you can go for

29:08.860 --> 29:09.860
two months.

29:09.860 --> 29:15.700
Here's what you're going to get for five dollars, 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one

29:15.700 --> 29:20.380
CPU and a terabyte of transfer, a terabyte.

29:20.380 --> 29:23.500
And they have data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam

29:23.500 --> 29:24.900
and London.

29:24.900 --> 29:29.260
But that interface right, I mean it's inspired.

29:29.260 --> 29:35.260
It's so simple and very intuitive and power users can replicate that interface on a larger

29:35.260 --> 29:38.980
scale with DigitalOcean's straightforward API.

29:38.980 --> 29:42.540
And I've said that a lot, but I want to show you how that actually manifests in stuff you

29:42.540 --> 29:43.540
can use.

29:43.540 --> 29:45.780
Now you could take advantage of that API.

29:45.780 --> 29:49.020
Maybe you have more skills than I have and you would actually be able to write your own

29:49.020 --> 29:53.060
scripts or manage to snap it into your own puppet management infrastructure on your own.

29:53.060 --> 29:58.620
That honestly is just beyond my capability, but what is easily within my capability is

29:58.620 --> 30:02.340
taking advantage of all of the cool stuff that the DigitalOcean community has already

30:02.340 --> 30:05.300
created around this API for me for absolutely free.

30:05.300 --> 30:08.340
Like it's just a benny of being a DigitalOcean customer.

30:08.340 --> 30:11.260
Like number one, right here, dropper control panel.

30:11.260 --> 30:12.260
Have you seen this?

30:12.260 --> 30:17.420
This is a management control panel for your DigitalOcean droplets for the Android device.

30:17.420 --> 30:19.140
There's even a nicer one for iOS.

30:19.140 --> 30:24.620
But you know I know most of you are probably Android users, no judging, that's cool.

30:24.620 --> 30:25.660
Dropper control panel.

30:25.660 --> 30:31.900
It lets you start them up, back them up, copy them, move them around, take a snapshot, resize

30:31.900 --> 30:35.160
them, rename them from your freaking Android, right?

30:35.160 --> 30:38.380
That's just one use of the API.

30:38.380 --> 30:39.860
Here's another cool one, Lita.

30:39.860 --> 30:45.780
It's a chatroom bot that allows you to manage your DigitalOcean droplet within an IRC room.

30:45.780 --> 30:47.260
Now why would you want to use that?

30:47.260 --> 30:49.020
Psst, Honey Badger, I don't know.

30:49.020 --> 30:50.840
But I think that's amazing.

30:50.840 --> 30:53.060
The fact that you can do that is amazing.

30:53.060 --> 30:54.060
Here's another one.

30:54.060 --> 30:55.300
We're going to talk with Dustin very soon.

30:55.300 --> 30:57.360
Juju DigitalOcean provider.

30:57.360 --> 31:02.940
This is a way to snap in your DigitalOcean droplets with your Juju management infrastructure.

31:02.940 --> 31:06.540
And you can start doing all of this for $5 per month.

31:06.540 --> 31:09.740
And if you're just an average user, you don't have anything super sophisticated like this

31:09.740 --> 31:12.760
that you want to do, that doesn't matter.

31:12.760 --> 31:16.100
You can still take advantage of $5 a month to build your own own cloud installation,

31:16.100 --> 31:19.300
your own BitTorrent sync server, your own GitLab instance.

31:19.300 --> 31:24.140
You can do all of this with DigitalOcean and if you use our promo code, unplug December,

31:24.140 --> 31:25.140
you'll get that $10 credit.

31:25.140 --> 31:27.580
You can try it out for two months for absolutely free.

31:27.580 --> 31:28.580
DigitalOcean.com.

31:28.580 --> 31:29.580
Go check them out.

31:29.580 --> 31:31.540
Use the promo code, unplug December when you check out.

31:31.540 --> 31:36.400
And a huge thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Linux unplug program.

31:36.400 --> 31:38.540
You guys are so awesome and the community around them.

31:38.540 --> 31:41.780
And I didn't even get a chance to mention their tutorials that you can go right up and

31:41.780 --> 31:43.080
they'll pay you for them.

31:43.080 --> 31:45.180
It's so slick.

31:45.180 --> 31:48.060
DigitalOcean.com, unplug December when you check out.

31:48.060 --> 31:50.700
Alright, so let's shift gears.

31:50.700 --> 31:53.940
Let's start, let's talk about Ubuntu Snappy.

31:53.940 --> 31:57.820
So this was a topic of interest on this Sunday's Linux action show.

31:57.820 --> 32:02.220
During the news, we brought on Dustin Kirkland from Canonical.

32:02.220 --> 32:06.380
He's the Ubuntu cloud product manager and a strategist at Canonical.

32:06.380 --> 32:09.500
And his new baby is Ubuntu Snappy Core.

32:09.500 --> 32:14.900
Now just a super quick recap, Ubuntu Snappy Core is a new release from Ubuntu based, uses

32:14.900 --> 32:15.900
system deep.

32:15.900 --> 32:19.460
But what's actually more important is the base file system is tiny.

32:19.460 --> 32:23.300
The base system is very small and it's read only.

32:23.300 --> 32:26.060
When you get an update, you get a new instance of the file system.

32:26.060 --> 32:28.820
And when you reboot, you boot into that new instance.

32:28.820 --> 32:31.140
And if something doesn't work, you just choose the other one.

32:31.140 --> 32:38.660
The applications are fairly unaffected because essentially they're isolated probably in containers.

32:38.660 --> 32:42.140
And then when you can do these updates to the base system, you don't really affect the

32:42.140 --> 32:46.600
application data, the version of the application, the libraries they depend on.

32:46.600 --> 32:50.120
And if the update doesn't work, well it was a transactional update.

32:50.120 --> 32:52.620
So it's easy to roll back to the past version.

32:52.620 --> 32:58.320
So when Dustin was talking about this, I realized this would probably be a great way to have

32:58.320 --> 33:01.240
a very secure and stable rolling desktop release.

33:01.240 --> 33:04.220
So I asked him, is this the future of the Ubuntu project?

33:04.220 --> 33:05.220
Potentially.

33:05.220 --> 33:14.460
I don't know that it'll ever, we certainly haven't indicated that it will replace apps.

33:14.460 --> 33:17.140
Maybe being offered on all Ubuntu platforms in addition.

33:17.140 --> 33:22.140
Yeah, I think that's reasonable to say that anywhere you're doing Ubuntu, you can do either

33:22.140 --> 33:28.700
the traditional Debian package app get update, app get upgrade, or the snappy.

33:28.700 --> 33:34.940
I think that's a reasonable goal to shoot for.

33:34.940 --> 33:40.980
Myself as a long time Debian packager and Ubuntu developer, there's certainly places

33:40.980 --> 33:47.860
where I need to do Debian packages for the foreseeable future.

33:47.860 --> 33:52.020
So I guess my last question for you, just as some jargon I want to help clear up for

33:52.020 --> 33:53.020
the audience.

33:53.020 --> 33:58.140
So we have your standard Debian packages, we have click packages, snappy packages, and

33:58.140 --> 34:01.780
then there's also the management piece, which is called Juju.

34:01.780 --> 34:05.060
How does Juju fit in with Ubuntu snappy core?

34:05.060 --> 34:09.180
Can it be used to manage some of the services that might be riding on top of some of those

34:09.180 --> 34:10.180
containers?

34:10.180 --> 34:15.060
Yeah, so that's certainly on the longer term roadmap.

34:15.060 --> 34:19.100
Maybe a little bit farther out, a few months to a year out.

34:19.100 --> 34:26.900
Fundamentally, Juju is, as an orchestration tool, the goal of Juju is to create resources

34:26.900 --> 34:30.300
in the public cloud, private cloud, or bare metal solution of your choice.

34:30.300 --> 34:37.100
And Juju can create instances in Amazon, Google, Azure, as well as OpenStack on the private

34:37.100 --> 34:38.100
side of things.

34:38.100 --> 34:42.980
That instance would be like a full web stack with database ready to go, sort of like I

34:42.980 --> 34:46.540
click this and I deploy this charm and it's my whole setup, right?

34:46.540 --> 34:47.760
Yep, exactly.

34:47.760 --> 34:50.500
And that one charm might be a bundle of charms.

34:50.500 --> 34:53.580
It might not just be a single web app.

34:53.580 --> 34:57.720
It might be a web app that depends on a database, which has to be configured in a cluster with

34:57.720 --> 35:01.540
an HA proxy in front of it, a memcache on the side accelerating things.

35:01.540 --> 35:07.620
By the way, you want to log everything to a single aggregator, an RSS log.

35:07.620 --> 35:12.620
By the way, those logs you want to then pump into a big data solution, a Hadoop, and then

35:12.620 --> 35:15.980
MapReduce that and be able to elastic search your logs.

35:15.980 --> 35:22.380
That's a very typical Juju deploy one thing and it deploys all those services onto a dozen

35:22.380 --> 35:26.020
different instances running in the public cloud, private cloud, or bare metal of your

35:26.020 --> 35:27.020
choice.

35:27.020 --> 35:33.420
Now, when Juju starts that instance, I would see Juju as being able to start that instance

35:33.420 --> 35:39.260
as a traditional Ubuntu image or perhaps a snappy Ubuntu image where you've made the

35:39.260 --> 35:45.940
opinionated decision that this suite of services you're going to deploy in that snappy, transactionally

35:45.940 --> 35:48.940
upgraded model.

35:48.940 --> 35:54.060
That is going to be a pretty compelling product offering altogether and it's a really interesting

35:54.060 --> 35:55.060
space.

35:55.060 --> 35:56.060
Containerization is bringing a lot of changes.

35:56.060 --> 35:59.140
Dustin, is there anything else you want to cover, anything else you want to let us know

35:59.140 --> 36:03.460
about Ubuntu snappy?

36:03.460 --> 36:04.460
Come talk to us.

36:04.460 --> 36:06.740
Snappy devel is a mailing list.

36:06.740 --> 36:08.960
We've got an active community.

36:08.960 --> 36:14.820
We released just two days ago, just on Tuesday, and we put out images in the first public

36:14.820 --> 36:16.060
cloud, Azure.

36:16.060 --> 36:19.860
The other public clouds will be coming along the next couple of weeks.

36:19.860 --> 36:27.420
We published an initial image that you could play with in KVM and within six hours, we

36:27.420 --> 36:32.420
had posts on the list of people contributing vagrant images and VMware images.

36:32.420 --> 36:38.860
Personally, it caught me a little bit by surprise, not being a VMware, a vagrant user, that,

36:38.860 --> 36:44.680
oh yeah, how we missed that, but fortunately we've got an active community developing very

36:44.680 --> 36:45.680
quickly.

36:45.680 --> 36:52.060
So, yeah, come help us fill the gaps, scratch your own itches in the snappy world.

36:52.060 --> 36:58.340
A big thank you to Dustin for coming on the show and, Poppy, I couldn't help but notice,

36:58.340 --> 37:00.340
oh, he left, didn't he?

37:00.340 --> 37:04.580
Dang it, I couldn't help but notice on that video there, if you look closely, if you're

37:04.580 --> 37:08.460
watching the video version, you'll notice right there on the page, big pull quote from

37:08.460 --> 37:11.540
Microsoft, Microsoft loves Linux.

37:11.540 --> 37:14.380
Boom, right there on the page.

37:14.380 --> 37:18.300
Premier Azure, the launch partner for Ubuntu Snappy Core.

37:18.300 --> 37:22.460
So he didn't seem to be too big on the whole Ubuntu Snappy Core for the desktop, but of

37:22.460 --> 37:23.620
course he's the cloud guy, right?

37:23.620 --> 37:25.220
He's focused on the server stuff.

37:25.220 --> 37:26.900
So that makes sense.

37:26.900 --> 37:31.500
I can't judge, I can't judge, but I'm looking forward to trying out Snappy Core.

37:31.500 --> 37:38.820
We've got Snappy Core, Fedora Cloud, and CoreOS that are all kind of, Fedora Cloud though

37:38.820 --> 37:44.780
doesn't, so what's different here is Ubuntu Snappy and CoreOS inherently, as part of their

37:44.780 --> 37:50.060
product offering, sort of solve that, I gotta update the base OS, but keep the applications

37:50.060 --> 37:51.060
isolated.

37:51.060 --> 37:57.980
Fedora Cloud is more of a traditional OS, distro, but if you employ things like Atomic,

37:57.980 --> 37:59.380
then you get more of that functionality.

37:59.380 --> 38:00.960
That's kind of my rough understanding.

38:00.960 --> 38:06.140
So it's really, it's an area that you've got really like three or four very clear different

38:06.140 --> 38:08.700
attempts to solve this problem.

38:08.700 --> 38:11.820
Some people would say it's fragmentation, but I think it's, we're gonna see which one

38:11.820 --> 38:13.780
actually wins the race.

38:13.780 --> 38:18.520
So anybody in the Mumba room have any thoughts on the interview before we move on to our

38:18.520 --> 38:20.520
Fedora review?

38:20.520 --> 38:26.180
I think it's great and I'm really, I'm looking forward, I'm paying attention, that's pretty

38:26.180 --> 38:27.180
much it.

38:27.180 --> 38:28.180
Yeah, I agree.

38:28.180 --> 38:34.460
I think it's, I think what, where we're at right now is solving the I gotta patch a lot

38:34.460 --> 38:36.280
and I don't want to break my apps problem.

38:36.280 --> 38:38.240
That's where we're at today.

38:38.240 --> 38:45.140
But what we're, where we're going to end up, I suspect at the end of all of it is this

38:45.140 --> 38:51.060
is how you install a new application on Linux, period.

38:51.060 --> 38:56.000
Now we're not, we're not anywhere near there yet, but I feel like what we are working towards

38:56.000 --> 39:01.380
is the world's most amazing solution to solving that problem.

39:01.380 --> 39:04.740
How do you install X on Linux?

39:04.740 --> 39:07.980
I don't care what distro it is, how do you do it?

39:07.980 --> 39:11.980
And it's going to be one answer and when it's going to take us, what we're going to document

39:11.980 --> 39:17.220
on this show and it's going to take a long ass tedious time is the process of us going

39:17.220 --> 39:22.020
from how do I update my rig all the time because man, I keep getting exploited.

39:22.020 --> 39:23.500
That's where we're at today.

39:23.500 --> 39:27.900
But what we're going to watch that transform into is that how do I install it on Linux?

39:27.900 --> 39:30.220
And that's going to be an interesting journey for us to document.

39:30.220 --> 39:32.300
I think it's going to take more than 70 episodes though.

39:32.300 --> 39:33.300
Oh yeah.

39:33.300 --> 39:34.300
I think so.

39:34.300 --> 39:35.300
Yeah.

39:35.300 --> 39:38.780
Well, I think everybody wants to get to the Fedora review and I agree.

39:38.780 --> 39:40.940
I think Fedora 21 has been an amazing release.

39:40.940 --> 39:42.820
We've talked a lot about it.

39:42.820 --> 39:47.460
I hope the audience is okay with this deep diving like this because we've, we obviously

39:47.460 --> 39:50.740
have been talking and this will be about the third week or in a row or so that we're talking

39:50.740 --> 39:52.180
about it.

39:52.180 --> 39:57.020
But I feel like when, when a Linux distribution that's at least as important as Fedora, but

39:57.020 --> 40:02.380
any Linux distribution that has, that has as much of a wide reach that Fedora has, that

40:02.380 --> 40:06.260
has many, that has as many contributors working for it that Fedora has and has the role that

40:06.260 --> 40:12.840
Fedora has to go through what we've seen it go through, to split off into these three

40:12.840 --> 40:18.780
distinctive flavors, to be, to be willing when you're, when you're at the size of Fedora

40:18.780 --> 40:25.340
to just say eff it and just go for it and just do something totally different.

40:25.340 --> 40:29.900
And then to pull that off, like I, I'm going to be honest.

40:29.900 --> 40:33.900
I kind of thought when Fedora was talking about going with three flavors and doing it

40:33.900 --> 40:37.940
in like essentially one release cycle, I was like, yeah, okay, well if you think you can

40:37.940 --> 40:40.340
pull that off, good luck to you.

40:40.340 --> 40:41.340
You know, really.

40:41.340 --> 40:42.380
I mean, I was skeptical about it.

40:42.380 --> 40:43.380
And now here we are.

40:43.380 --> 40:44.380
Fedora 21 is released.

40:44.380 --> 40:45.380
Yeah.

40:45.380 --> 40:46.380
A little delayed.

40:46.380 --> 40:47.380
No bigs.

40:47.380 --> 40:48.620
And it, and they seriously did it.

40:48.620 --> 40:51.620
So that's incredible to me.

40:51.620 --> 40:56.820
And I think it might be one of the most interesting distribution related things has happened this

40:56.820 --> 40:57.820
year.

40:57.820 --> 40:59.980
Not just one, but one of them.

40:59.980 --> 41:02.500
So we're going to get the community's input on that.

41:02.500 --> 41:04.860
But first let's talk about our friends at Ting.

41:04.860 --> 41:07.540
They're ending 2015 with a freaking bang.

41:07.540 --> 41:08.540
Ting is mobile.

41:08.540 --> 41:09.540
That makes sense.

41:09.540 --> 41:12.540
My mobile service provider and Matt's linux.ting.com is where you go.

41:12.540 --> 41:17.920
Let's represent for the Linux Unplugged show at the end of 2014 linux.ting.com.

41:17.920 --> 41:18.920
So why Ting?

41:18.920 --> 41:19.920
Why does it make sense?

41:19.920 --> 41:20.920
What do I mean by that?

41:20.920 --> 41:22.660
Well, first of all, no contract, right?

41:22.660 --> 41:24.900
Because the contract, it just really doesn't make any sense.

41:24.900 --> 41:28.980
But what also doesn't make any sense is paying into these plans that you may use plans like,

41:28.980 --> 41:31.700
like it feels like insurance and I always kind of feel like that doesn't make sense

41:31.700 --> 41:32.700
either.

41:32.700 --> 41:34.840
Ting instead, it's just pay for what you use.

41:34.840 --> 41:36.780
So it starts with $6 for the line.

41:36.780 --> 41:37.780
That's all you pay.

41:37.780 --> 41:39.180
And that's pretty straightforward.

41:39.180 --> 41:40.180
I can afford that.

41:40.180 --> 41:42.620
That's why I've got three of them, right?

41:42.620 --> 41:45.900
Because what matters is what you actually freaking use.

41:45.900 --> 41:47.840
So it's just your minutes, your megabytes, your messages.

41:47.840 --> 41:49.800
They add them all up and that's what you pay.

41:49.800 --> 41:52.140
If you want to turn on hotspot, that's fine.

41:52.140 --> 41:53.140
Do it.

41:53.140 --> 41:54.340
Make it, make it a wifi access point.

41:54.340 --> 41:55.340
That's just data usage.

41:55.340 --> 41:56.500
Just not a big deal.

41:56.500 --> 42:00.180
And if you're savvy about using wifi, like when you're on wifi and you make your calls

42:00.180 --> 42:03.500
over that, I mean you can have incredible savings with Ting because again, you're just

42:03.500 --> 42:04.900
paying for what you use.

42:04.900 --> 42:07.380
So linux.ting.com, start there, okay?

42:07.380 --> 42:10.020
That'll get you $25 off your first Ting device.

42:10.020 --> 42:12.820
If you have advice that's compatible, they have a bring your own device page where you

42:12.820 --> 42:14.040
can check that out.

42:14.040 --> 42:17.540
If you have a device that's compatible, well, they'll give you $25 of credits.

42:17.540 --> 42:19.700
Well, the first month, like usually is like 26 bucks.

42:19.700 --> 42:22.060
So you're going to get your first month pretty much for free.

42:22.060 --> 42:24.420
If you have a contract, well, Ting's going to help you get out of that.

42:24.420 --> 42:27.940
So you're going to get $150 for the line that you have to cancel.

42:27.940 --> 42:34.140
Yeah, it's $150 in credits, but it's $150 in freaking credits.

42:34.140 --> 42:36.700
That's money you won't have to pay for your cell service.

42:36.700 --> 42:37.700
That's really great.

42:37.700 --> 42:39.940
Plus, they have an awesome control panel.

42:39.940 --> 42:44.660
You can call them at 1855-TING-FTW anytime between 8 a.m. or 8 p.m. east coast time.

42:44.660 --> 42:45.940
Yeah, it's east coast time.

42:45.940 --> 42:46.940
I'm sorry about that.

42:46.940 --> 42:47.940
I know, I know.

42:47.940 --> 42:48.940
It's not Pacific.

42:48.940 --> 42:49.940
I'm sorry.

42:49.940 --> 42:50.940
But it's east coast time.

42:50.940 --> 42:52.240
The human being answers the phone.

42:52.240 --> 42:53.240
That's okay.

42:53.240 --> 42:54.740
So that's like boom.

42:54.740 --> 42:55.820
That's the foundation of Ting.

42:55.820 --> 42:58.240
You can already see they're thinking about this differently.

42:58.240 --> 43:02.620
You can see they're trying to disrupt the crazy ass restrictive mobile industry.

43:02.620 --> 43:04.860
Okay, that's pretty straightforward.

43:04.860 --> 43:10.000
Well, what struck me about Ting is when they don't have to, when they don't gotta, they're

43:10.000 --> 43:12.820
going out of their way to make their stance on issues clear.

43:12.820 --> 43:17.380
They recently had a blog post about net neutrality that I thought was really well reasoned and

43:17.380 --> 43:18.380
really well put together.

43:18.380 --> 43:21.740
I thought, okay, I feel like my money's going to a good place.

43:21.740 --> 43:22.740
They're coming here.

43:22.740 --> 43:23.940
They're thinking about this rationally.

43:23.940 --> 43:25.260
They're taking a stand.

43:25.260 --> 43:30.980
They're articulating that stand really well, and I thought that's really cool.

43:30.980 --> 43:34.420
They're screwing with the mobile industry by offering something totally different.

43:34.420 --> 43:39.060
They're about to roll GSM and CDMA out at the same time starting in 2015, which is gonna

43:39.060 --> 43:40.860
be a game changer.

43:40.860 --> 43:44.900
I'm loving all of that, but let's be honest.

43:44.900 --> 43:47.260
There's more that could be done, right?

43:47.260 --> 43:53.300
Wireless is fundamentally critical to the future of a lot of mobile apps, a lot of mobile

43:53.300 --> 43:59.460
web stuff, but at the end of the day, I still got that wired connection.

43:59.460 --> 44:01.320
I cannot believe it.

44:01.320 --> 44:02.680
This is what I love about Ting.

44:02.680 --> 44:05.460
This is why I always preach vote with your wallet.

44:05.460 --> 44:08.420
Ting is going to launch, and now they're starting small.

44:08.420 --> 44:13.720
I mean, they have to start within reason, but they're going after residential internet

44:13.720 --> 44:14.720
access now.

44:14.720 --> 44:16.980
See, now this is just the beginning of something.

44:16.980 --> 44:17.980
It's not a big thing.

44:17.980 --> 44:20.580
It's only in one area right now because it's just like Google Fiber.

44:20.580 --> 44:27.100
They gotta start small, but they're starting to roll out crazy fast fiber access to the

44:27.100 --> 44:31.340
home, and they're gonna take the whole Ting model to all of it.

44:31.340 --> 44:39.820
I think it's... This could be huge for everyone, like not just users of Ting, but everyone

44:39.820 --> 44:40.860
on the internet.

44:40.860 --> 44:44.460
They seriously care about this stuff, and again, that's why we talk about voting with

44:44.460 --> 44:46.500
your wallet, linux.ting.com.

44:46.500 --> 44:47.500
Go there.

44:47.500 --> 44:48.500
They got it on their blog.

44:48.500 --> 44:49.500
You can read about it, but go to linux.ting.com first.

44:49.500 --> 44:53.020
That way, we get credit for your visit, but then go over to their blog and check this

44:53.020 --> 44:54.020
out.

44:54.020 --> 44:55.020
They're rolling out fiber.

44:55.020 --> 45:01.340
Unfortunately, it's like in Virginia right now, yeah, Charlottesville, Charlottesville.

45:01.340 --> 45:03.400
I want it so bad.

45:03.400 --> 45:04.940
This is so cool.

45:04.940 --> 45:09.620
I think this is another example of a great sponsor that I'm really, really happy to have

45:09.620 --> 45:13.220
because I really believe in what they're trying to do, and I think that's just so amazing.

45:13.220 --> 45:17.980
I mean, they've already... For the last two years, it's totally changed the way I think

45:17.980 --> 45:18.980
about mobile.

45:18.980 --> 45:22.100
It's changed how I look at the whole industry, and now, I'm going to look at what they're

45:22.100 --> 45:23.940
doing at residential ISP service.

45:23.940 --> 45:27.500
This Ting is crazy, and I love it, linux.ting.com.

45:27.500 --> 45:29.660
Go over there and check them out.

45:29.660 --> 45:30.660
See how much you could save.

45:30.660 --> 45:31.860
They have a savings calculator.

45:31.860 --> 45:35.900
Check them out, linux.ting.com, and a big thanks to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged

45:35.900 --> 45:36.900
Show.

45:36.900 --> 45:41.140
Okay, guys, so let's talk about Fedora 21.

45:41.140 --> 45:42.140
Let's get started.

45:42.140 --> 45:43.940
First up, get fedora.org.

45:43.940 --> 45:44.940
It's their new site.

45:44.940 --> 45:49.860
They're very proud of it, and you know what I find to be interesting on this site?

45:49.860 --> 45:55.220
First sentence, Fedora is now more focused, and isn't that true?

45:55.220 --> 45:58.700
Isn't that exactly what they've addressed in Fedora 21?

45:58.700 --> 46:01.700
You've got your workstation release, your server release, and your cloud release.

46:01.700 --> 46:08.940
Now, I think probably not a large leap of assumption here to consider.

46:08.940 --> 46:11.320
We've probably all just been looking at the workstation release.

46:11.320 --> 46:13.060
Not a lot of us looked at the server or cloud, right?

46:13.060 --> 46:16.140
Anybody done any of the server or cloud stuff?

46:16.140 --> 46:17.140
I didn't think so.

46:17.140 --> 46:18.140
That's fine.

46:18.140 --> 46:19.140
Maybe we'll do that in the future.

46:19.140 --> 46:22.020
So let's start with Fedora workstation.

46:22.020 --> 46:24.240
Go ahead and tag me in the mumble room, anybody that wants to start.

46:24.240 --> 46:29.140
I'll begin with my experience, tell you what I did, and then we'll jump into the mumble

46:29.140 --> 46:30.140
room.

46:30.140 --> 46:38.980
So I installed Fedora 21 64-bit on my Bonobo and also on a Dell Sputnik laptop that was

46:38.980 --> 46:44.380
sent to me by Colonel Linux in the mumble room, and I also tried it for about a half

46:44.380 --> 46:50.900
hour on an Apple MacBook Pro 2013-ish.

46:50.900 --> 46:52.920
I don't really know the model number.

46:52.920 --> 46:59.540
So that was the range of hardware that I experimented with Fedora 21 on, all GNOME across the board,

46:59.540 --> 47:03.860
because I decided to go with the environment that I was most comfortable with.

47:03.860 --> 47:05.860
So let's start with Colonel Linux.

47:05.860 --> 47:08.300
How was your experience on your laptop?

47:08.300 --> 47:12.940
So I installed it on my Dell E6320, and that worked really great.

47:12.940 --> 47:18.380
In fact, that's my new daily operating system now, is 21, and that worked really well.

47:18.380 --> 47:23.940
But I had a nook that I used for doing different things, and that was when it first came out,

47:23.940 --> 47:27.060
I wanted to throw it on something, and that was what happened to be laying around, and

47:27.060 --> 47:28.060
it sucks.

47:28.060 --> 47:29.840
The lock screen freezes up.

47:29.840 --> 47:33.420
So like if I were to switch over to that computer right now, I have to hit escape like 15 times

47:33.420 --> 47:37.100
and wait like 30 seconds, and it's running on an 840 Pro SSD.

47:37.100 --> 47:39.380
So I shouldn't be waiting for it, but I do wait for it.

47:39.380 --> 47:44.980
That doesn't happen in Ubuntu 14.4, so I don't know.

47:44.980 --> 47:49.660
You know, I had my first like, oh my God, it's going to happen moment with Fedora 21.

47:49.660 --> 47:52.820
I don't have these very often anymore with computers.

47:52.820 --> 47:55.380
I guess it just doesn't happen a lot.

47:55.380 --> 47:59.500
And Matt, it's kind of funny because it made me think of the monkey suit right away.

47:59.500 --> 48:00.500
Of course.

48:00.500 --> 48:01.500
Oh no.

48:01.500 --> 48:09.140
I was on the Sputnik that Colonel Linux sent me that I've selfishly held onto.

48:09.140 --> 48:11.380
Thank you, Colonel Linux.

48:11.380 --> 48:16.540
And it's an Intel chip in the Sputnik, and I thought, well, so I'm all open source through

48:16.540 --> 48:18.140
and through right now.

48:18.140 --> 48:22.940
And at the GDM login screen, and you hit the little gear button, you have your GNOME desktop,

48:22.940 --> 48:27.640
GNOME Classic, and then on there is GNOME and Wayland.

48:27.640 --> 48:33.740
And so I chose GNOME Wayland, and I logged in, and then at first I thought, did it not

48:33.740 --> 48:36.260
work?

48:36.260 --> 48:37.500
I think it's still using X.

48:37.500 --> 48:41.980
Like, and I launched like Terminal, I launched Chrome, I launched the activities overview.

48:41.980 --> 48:44.180
I'm like, oh, I guess it didn't work.

48:44.180 --> 48:47.100
And then I started to realize like a couple of things weren't working quite right.

48:47.100 --> 48:49.740
Like my trackpad, like I couldn't click on stuff.

48:49.740 --> 48:53.540
I could move the mouse with the trackpad, but I couldn't click on anything, and I couldn't

48:53.540 --> 48:54.540
scroll.

48:54.540 --> 48:56.960
But if I had a USB mouse, I could use that.

48:56.960 --> 49:02.520
And I started to realize, oh, I actually, I actually, I'm using Wayland right now.

49:02.520 --> 49:07.060
I'm using Wayland with GNOME 3 and the Chrome browser right now.

49:07.060 --> 49:11.260
And I had this total like, oh my God, I'm using Wayland and it's working flawlessly

49:11.260 --> 49:12.260
moment.

49:12.260 --> 49:13.860
And like, it was amazing.

49:13.860 --> 49:19.780
Like here we are, I keep saying this, the end of 2014, but I actually, I actually just

49:19.780 --> 49:26.500
had like a essentially trouble-free Wayland desktop, no futzing, except for my trackpad

49:26.500 --> 49:27.500
didn't work.

49:27.500 --> 49:32.780
But it was, it was kind of like Fedora 21 was my first and it was like, oh wow, thank

49:32.780 --> 49:33.780
you.

49:33.780 --> 49:34.780
That was incredible.

49:34.780 --> 49:39.020
And now I know like it's ex-Wayland doing all the windowing stuff, but it was, it was

49:39.020 --> 49:40.020
kind of amazing.

49:40.020 --> 49:43.340
RA, I know you were here specifically to touch on Wayland.

49:43.340 --> 49:45.180
Do you have any comments on that?

49:45.180 --> 49:46.180
RA?

49:46.180 --> 49:47.180
RA.

49:47.180 --> 49:51.780
Oh, I'm sorry, RA, yeah, I'm sorry, RA.

49:51.780 --> 49:57.940
Yeah, actually I would like to announce that I'm running on Wayland right now.

49:57.940 --> 50:03.820
And I think I'm the first person in the chat room to talk while on Wayland.

50:03.820 --> 50:04.820
Is that true?

50:04.820 --> 50:05.820
Yeah, you might be.

50:05.820 --> 50:09.140
I think you are our first Wayland-based mumbler.

50:09.140 --> 50:12.820
And actually I had the same story like you, Chris.

50:12.820 --> 50:14.380
My trackpad doesn't work.

50:14.380 --> 50:16.380
And I had the same Wayland surprise.

50:16.380 --> 50:22.900
Like I tried Rebecca Black Linux, which was supposed to work out well.

50:22.900 --> 50:28.940
And also Fedora 20 and all those shenanigans, as Matt would say.

50:28.940 --> 50:33.700
And it didn't work and Fedora, suddenly I realized I was on Wayland and it didn't crash

50:33.700 --> 50:35.180
and it runs fine.

50:35.180 --> 50:36.180
Yeah.

50:36.180 --> 50:37.180
Yeah, it's pretty neat.

50:37.180 --> 50:41.540
I mean, it's not done, but it's pretty neat to see that happen.

50:41.540 --> 50:45.660
And I don't know, I mean, it's been a big discussion piece for a long time.

50:45.660 --> 50:50.220
So RA, I'm sorry, you'll be our Wayland correspondent, okay?

50:50.220 --> 50:53.420
You keep us updated on your Wayland developments, all right?

50:53.420 --> 50:54.420
Okay.

50:54.420 --> 50:55.420
All right, very good.

50:55.420 --> 50:56.420
Thank you.

50:56.420 --> 51:00.500
So any other comments from the Mumble Room on their Fedora 21 experience?

51:00.500 --> 51:01.500
I'll end it with this.

51:01.500 --> 51:06.460
And I was, I'm hoping maybe somebody can walk me back from the ledge.

51:06.460 --> 51:13.100
But I'm ready to declare Fedora 21 my next distro if I jump.

51:13.100 --> 51:14.100
I'm ready.

51:14.100 --> 51:15.100
Wow.

51:15.100 --> 51:16.100
I've never heard of it before.

51:16.100 --> 51:18.500
I mean, I'll give people, walk me back, walk me back from it.

51:18.500 --> 51:23.420
But I'm just right now, here's the thing, here's what's limiting, is the software availability

51:23.420 --> 51:25.240
still sucks.

51:25.240 --> 51:28.260
And I will, I also, before I go in this, have to acknowledge-

51:28.260 --> 51:29.580
How do you mean?

51:29.580 --> 51:36.980
Well, like, for example, Heropad, a Markdown editor, does not exist for Fedora.

51:36.980 --> 51:39.580
It's a total impossibility.

51:39.580 --> 51:40.580
It's a nightmare.

51:40.580 --> 51:42.620
I even tried building it from source and it ran like ass.

51:42.620 --> 51:44.800
It was a total nightmare.

51:44.800 --> 51:47.500
But if I'm on Ubuntu, I've got a PPA ready to go.

51:47.500 --> 51:51.780
If I'm on the Arch, well, of course, the AUR has got that ass a decade ago, it had that

51:51.780 --> 51:52.780
in there.

51:52.780 --> 51:53.780
200 years ago, it had that in there.

51:53.780 --> 51:56.380
But when I go to Fedora, I'm like in no man's land, right?

51:56.380 --> 51:57.380
Okay, Viber.

51:57.380 --> 51:59.100
Viber is another example.

51:59.100 --> 52:00.220
I don't like it.

52:00.220 --> 52:04.900
I admit it is a crap application that we should move away from, but I need it to correspond

52:04.900 --> 52:08.340
with people that are in the field and people that are out and about and, okay, Viber is

52:08.340 --> 52:09.340
a thing.

52:09.340 --> 52:10.340
You know what?

52:10.340 --> 52:11.760
If you're on Fedora, go screw yourself.

52:11.760 --> 52:13.200
You're on Arch, no problem.

52:13.200 --> 52:14.700
You're on Ubuntu, no problem.

52:14.700 --> 52:17.300
You're on Fedora, I hate you.

52:17.300 --> 52:20.260
That kind of stuff drives me crazy with Fedora.

52:20.260 --> 52:25.980
Whereas with Arch, again, I'm not saying this applies to everybody, but because I install

52:25.980 --> 52:30.060
four to five to six to seven to eight to 10 applications a week, that way I can pick one

52:30.060 --> 52:35.900
of those mother effers on the Linux Action Show, because I reinstall that many applications,

52:35.900 --> 52:41.980
like when I have to go out of my way to find a repo or download an RPM or build it from

52:41.980 --> 52:48.020
source, that adds 10 to 15 minutes, and if I'm doing five to 10 to those a week, that's

52:48.020 --> 52:53.380
stupid because in the AUR, nowadays, I just go packer-s and I just put the name of the

52:53.380 --> 52:55.060
damn package in there and I've got it.

52:55.060 --> 52:58.340
I don't even look to see if they've got it because they've got it.

52:58.340 --> 53:05.740
Now that's where Fedora falls short, which only probably applies literally maybe to me.

53:05.740 --> 53:09.880
There might not be anybody else in the world that that applies to, and I accept that.

53:09.880 --> 53:13.780
If that does not apply to you, I feel like Fedora's got most of it because Copper's got

53:13.780 --> 53:15.100
a lot of stuff.

53:15.100 --> 53:19.300
There's a lot of stuff in the RPM Fusion and additional repos around Fedora, and if we

53:19.300 --> 53:24.120
use scripts like Fedly, F-E-D-L-Y or whatever it is, it'll set up a ton of stuff for you

53:24.120 --> 53:27.380
under Fedora that makes it a pretty good setup.

53:27.380 --> 53:32.800
For me right now, Fedora 21, it's the longest setup.

53:32.800 --> 53:39.860
It's the most post-installation work, but the process of doing that is fairly automated,

53:39.860 --> 53:41.460
fairly easy.

53:41.460 --> 53:45.180
You can pretty much just do it, sit, click, click, click, and you're done.

53:45.180 --> 53:49.580
It takes a lot of work, but after that work's done, it's ready to go.

53:49.580 --> 53:53.260
If you start with something like Karora, which I don't think has their 21 release out yet,

53:53.260 --> 53:59.700
but Karora Linux, which is Fedora with all the goodies that are evil pre-built in, then

53:59.700 --> 54:01.900
it's even a quicker go.

54:01.900 --> 54:03.780
That's what I mean with Fedora 21.

54:03.780 --> 54:08.960
It's great with the exception that it does require a lot of work to get going.

54:08.960 --> 54:14.500
If you want Steam, you want proprietary drivers, you want Codex, you want Flash, you want Java,

54:14.500 --> 54:18.980
you know Chrome, you know that kind of stuff, it takes a while.

54:18.980 --> 54:19.980
That's fine.

54:19.980 --> 54:25.120
Yeah, I've definitely found that the one area Fedora doesn't quite do it for me is package

54:25.120 --> 54:30.900
availability because I do find myself needing either PPAs or AUR, something that has a little

54:30.900 --> 54:31.900
bit more.

54:31.900 --> 54:33.060
It's not even about being recent.

54:33.060 --> 54:38.020
It's just about me not having to compile it or dig through an RPM on an old ice or whatever.

54:38.020 --> 54:39.020
Yeah, I agree with you, Matt.

54:39.020 --> 54:40.020
I do.

54:40.020 --> 54:41.020
Rotten Corpse, go ahead.

54:41.020 --> 54:46.420
Yeah, I've actually set up my laptop to be the Fedora, so it's like my second distro

54:46.420 --> 54:52.540
choice now, but mainly because copper is one of the things I'm super excited about.

54:52.540 --> 54:57.260
Yeah, so can you kind of explain a little bit about copper because we've name dropped

54:57.260 --> 54:58.260
it.

54:58.260 --> 55:00.700
We talked about it on Sunday's Linux Action Show.

55:00.700 --> 55:05.060
Is it fair to say it's sort of an AUR arch user repository equivalent?

55:05.060 --> 55:14.780
Well, it's more of a PPA equivalent, so you can build different branches kind of thing,

55:14.780 --> 55:15.780
so the different packages.

55:15.780 --> 55:20.500
The only thing that I see so far that I don't like about copper is that it's restricted

55:20.500 --> 55:24.940
to open source free software type of stuff.

55:24.940 --> 55:30.940
So the reason you say that is because the building doesn't happen on the Fedora workstation

55:30.940 --> 55:32.500
when you install the package?

55:32.500 --> 55:33.500
Right.

55:33.500 --> 55:36.260
They set up the builds on their servers.

55:36.260 --> 55:37.260
Gotcha.

55:37.260 --> 55:42.220
Now, Dave, you wanted to comment on other desktops besides GNOME?

55:42.220 --> 55:49.060
Yeah, I'm just saying while GNOME is the default offering, it's not the only offering, and

55:49.060 --> 55:53.140
other desktops do work flawlessly on Fedora.

55:53.140 --> 55:58.220
If you're running Cinnamon, KDE, LXDE, whatever, don't expect to have problems.

55:58.220 --> 56:02.420
If not, something like Unity, you can only install that.

56:02.420 --> 56:04.260
Yeah, very true.

56:04.260 --> 56:08.940
In fact, Matthew Miller said that KDE is a very important desktop, as well as many of

56:08.940 --> 56:09.940
the others.

56:09.940 --> 56:13.980
Ra, you've been using the OpenSUSE build service with your Fedora installation?

56:13.980 --> 56:18.140
Yeah, and I found that it works really nice.

56:18.140 --> 56:20.880
Sometimes they provide Fedora packages.

56:20.880 --> 56:23.980
Sometimes the OpenSUSE packages work.

56:23.980 --> 56:26.820
It's been really smooth, but I agree that it's kind of hard.

56:26.820 --> 56:33.860
For example, I didn't get Eclipse to work until I found out that the dev tool that they

56:33.860 --> 56:37.980
bundle with the workstation actually works perfect for that.

56:37.980 --> 56:41.580
Well, I'll tell you, it is a pretty great service.

56:41.580 --> 56:43.820
Eric, I know that's something you're familiar with, right?

56:43.820 --> 56:44.820
Correct.

56:44.820 --> 56:51.860
I have used the OpenSUSE build service quite a bit, especially in OpenSUSE, to get stuff

56:51.860 --> 56:54.260
installed, find packages and whatnot.

56:54.260 --> 56:57.940
The only thing is they don't have Fedora 21 just yet.

56:57.940 --> 57:02.780
They probably will in the soon future, I would imagine, but they don't have the ability to

57:02.780 --> 57:06.140
build packages for Fedora 21 just yet.

57:06.140 --> 57:11.220
I'm looking forward to that because, for instance, the KDE Connect indicator, which has been

57:11.220 --> 57:16.740
our subreddit a couple of times, it can be installed on OpenSUSE.

57:16.740 --> 57:20.520
It's just not very successful, but it's built for Fedora 20.

57:20.520 --> 57:21.820
It works properly in Fedora 20.

57:21.820 --> 57:25.140
It just needs to be compiled for Fedora 21, and that'd be fine.

57:25.140 --> 57:31.180
You kind of went through the process of trying to submit that to the Copper...

57:31.180 --> 57:32.180
Is it repository?

57:32.180 --> 57:33.180
I'm not sure what to call it.

57:33.180 --> 57:36.380
Yeah, just Copper, I guess.

57:36.380 --> 57:38.380
I did, but the build failed.

57:38.380 --> 57:42.220
The build failed because it...Well, actually, no, the build succeeded.

57:42.220 --> 57:43.220
I apologize.

57:43.220 --> 57:44.220
The build succeeded.

57:44.220 --> 57:50.420
When I went to install, it failed to function, so I'm not exactly sure why that is.

57:50.420 --> 57:57.020
It does the same thing in OpenSUSE, so I imagine because they're in the Git sources, I think

57:57.020 --> 58:03.100
it is built more for Debian and Ubuntu than it is for anything else, so it's a matter

58:03.100 --> 58:04.420
of just making it compatible.

58:04.420 --> 58:08.000
I know there's people working on it in the Git repository.

58:08.000 --> 58:15.340
This is the hurdle that Fedora now has to overcome, is the Linux desktop market has

58:15.340 --> 58:21.740
moved on, and I don't mean to disparage Fedora, but in that sense, it is just simply so much

58:21.740 --> 58:28.260
easier to get some of that software for Ubuntu and for Arch.

58:28.260 --> 58:32.460
Two examples that are very popular, KDE Connect and Herupad.

58:32.460 --> 58:36.740
Herupad is an amazing markdown editor that is really gaining in popularity.

58:36.740 --> 58:39.620
We talked about it three or four months ago in the Linux action show, and they've just

58:39.620 --> 58:41.740
been blowing up since then.

58:41.740 --> 58:42.800
It's available for Ubuntu.

58:42.800 --> 58:43.800
It's available for Arch.

58:43.800 --> 58:44.860
It's not available for Fedora.

58:44.860 --> 58:50.140
Those are just isolated examples, but I believe that is Fedora's problem now.

58:50.140 --> 58:54.260
What they have done here, I think, has laid the groundwork to address that.

58:54.260 --> 58:55.260
Fedora workstation.

58:55.260 --> 58:59.520
I had a conversation with Michael Dominic on Monday's Coda Radio, where he's back on

58:59.520 --> 59:03.220
Linux now for his development workstation, and he was asking, if I reload, what should

59:03.220 --> 59:04.220
I switch to?

59:04.220 --> 59:09.200
And I made a pitch for Fedora, because honestly, they've got dev assist.

59:09.200 --> 59:10.780
They're really close to upstream.

59:10.780 --> 59:13.060
That's one of the things I've always said about Arch that I liked a lot, is I felt like

59:13.060 --> 59:14.340
I'm closer to upstream.

59:14.340 --> 59:21.200
Well, Fedora's got that, but it also has that background leadership by Red Hat, which I

59:21.200 --> 59:24.740
believe, at the end of the day, to have a commercial entity that says, you know what?

59:24.740 --> 59:26.740
We've got to produce something here.

59:26.740 --> 59:28.060
We've got stuff we've got to do.

59:28.060 --> 59:31.820
I think that actually is just what it takes to prevent issues like we've just seen with

59:31.820 --> 59:35.940
Debian, but it's not where they're directly pulling all of the strings.

59:35.940 --> 59:37.340
I think it's just the right mix.

59:37.340 --> 59:39.680
I like that about Fedora, right?

59:39.680 --> 59:41.220
From that perspective, I enjoy it.

59:41.220 --> 59:45.860
The fact that they're all in with Gnome, I think that really makes it a great Gnome experience.

59:45.860 --> 59:49.460
The dev assist stuff, all of that, I think, actually makes it a pretty compelling developer's

59:49.460 --> 59:51.020
workstation, just like they've been pitching it.

59:51.020 --> 59:58.460
So when he asked me, what should I use for my Linux workstation, honestly, I gave a harder

59:58.460 --> 01:00:08.180
pitch for Ubuntu Mate 14.04, but I said, with that considered, Fedora 21 is a serious, serious

01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:09.180
contender.

01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:17.780
And if you've watched me over the years, you know how I've felt about Fedora, right?

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:23.260
If you look at some of our shows from five years ago, compared to what I'm saying about

01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:26.740
Fedora today, they have turned it around, I think.

01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:28.020
Oh, I agree.

01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:29.140
I definitely agree with that.

01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:34.140
I definitely like the direction they're going with everything, except software availability.

01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:36.740
Everything else is honestly blowing everyone else out of the water.

01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:37.740
Yeah, nailed it.

01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:38.740
You nailed it.

01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:39.740
That's exactly it, in a nutshell.

01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:40.740
That's exactly the...

01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:46.640
And the software availability is slowly improving, and it actually is going in the right direction.

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:47.640
So it's pretty cool.

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:49.140
And I think that'll probably button up our coverage of...

01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:50.140
Oh, go ahead.

01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:55.380
Yeah, I just have a word of clarity that KDE Connect works flawlessly in Fedora under KDE,

01:00:55.380 --> 01:01:00.420
however using the KDE Connect indicator, which is for other desktop environments, it doesn't

01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:02.180
work quite so well.

01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:09.380
Also the chat room has been asking, and Colonel Linux, you'll be happy to hear.

01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:13.380
So I tried out Fedora 21 on a MacBook.

01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:17.180
It does not go to graphical environment at all if you have a second monitor hooked up

01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:23.500
over the Thunderbolt adapter, but if you are just doing a single monitor, everything except

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:29.540
for...I didn't try the webcam or wireless, but Bluetooth, Thunderbolt, Ethernet works.

01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:34.700
But what was really impressive is it not only supports the retina display on the MacBook,

01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:39.420
but GNOME looks pretty good.

01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:47.860
Chrome and Firefox, the text is really small, but the GNOME UI itself, I don't have a lot

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:54.620
of experience with retina display, but it was amazing.

01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:56.620
Look at GNOME on that resolution, it looked great.

01:01:56.620 --> 01:02:00.020
I think you could fix the remainder of your problems just by...I think what the problem

01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:03.180
is is it conflicts with the existing Mac OS operating system.

01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:09.180
I think if you were to take that off, I think then everything would work fine.

01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:13.140
So anyways, I was kind of flabbergasted.

01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:17.140
It's the first time I've ever just put a thumb drive into a MacBook Pro, booted it up, and

01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:21.260
actually had Linux working on it, and able to use the networking and all of that.

01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:22.900
So there you go.

01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:24.740
I am very impressed with Fedora 21.

01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:28.620
Ww, why don't you give us your closing thoughts on your experience with Fedora 21?

01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:33.860
Well, I'm going to have to preface it with saying I tried it on seven-year-old hardware

01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:36.740
and I thought, oh, it's Linux, it should work.

01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:44.820
And I ran into issues where I could just not install for the life of me, no matter what.

01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:46.140
Oh, really?

01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:47.140
Yeah.

01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:50.860
I mean, I'm running it on an AMD.

01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:54.780
It's my other laptop, not my main laptop.

01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:59.340
It's an AMD 2 gigahertz dual-core with an NVIDIA 6150.

01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:05.140
And it just, after like, when it went to format the drive and install, I left it there for

01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:07.060
like two hours.

01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:11.700
And you were doing text snap at the time, and by the time that was over, I'm still waiting

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:12.700
for the system to run.

01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:13.700
Now that's a long time.

01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:14.700
Yeah.

01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:15.700
Yeah.

01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:23.860
I did want to, for the most part, from what I experienced of the install, it kind of reminded

01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:31.380
me of that Windows feel where it had a good level of polish, but I still felt it had some

01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:36.700
work to be done, like the warnings could be up higher for when you're trying to install

01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:37.700
something.

01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:40.180
Well, actually, pause right there just for a sec.

01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:44.260
I was actually kind of impressed with the way that they brought forward the SE Linux

01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:49.580
alerts, and would tell you, here's what SE Linux has detected.

01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:54.500
Here's like three or four fairly solid options you can do to resolve this problem.

01:03:54.500 --> 01:04:00.940
I thought A, that was impressive, and B, YUM or DNF, like I added the Dropbox repository

01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:06.900
for Fedora before it was ready, and what YUM does, when you do a YUM update, and then the

01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:13.140
Dropbox repo 404s, because they don't have anything set up for 21 yet, instead of YUM

01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:19.380
essing the bed, what it does is it says, hey, bro, I'm having troubles contacting this repo,

01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:24.100
you can run this command to disable the repo, or you can run this command and just say,

01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:28.340
you know what, ignore it when it 404s, it's no bigs.

01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:33.660
It's just enough power, but yet enough hand holding, that when you're new to YUM or DNF,

01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:36.340
you know what to do next.

01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:41.560
Having some basic Linux knowledge and system administration knowledge, okay, admittedly

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:46.620
more than basic, but that was enough, the information they provided me, I was able to

01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:52.380
take actions based on that and resolve my SC Linux issues, and resolve my YUM repo issues,

01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:54.220
and I thought it was really slick the way they handled it.

01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:57.020
So are you talking about that, WW, or are you talking about something else?

01:04:57.020 --> 01:05:04.700
No, no, I feel like my issue was more like a hardware incompatibility issue, or maybe

01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:10.900
I needed to throw a switch on some setup script, or when it booted off of the USB stick to

01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:17.180
do something, but I got no such prompt at all during the process.

01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:24.380
I know Poppy felt the same way about a certain issue with how the setup was for partitioning,

01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:27.040
and I thought it was confusing, and he did as well.

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:29.700
I don't know if he had some further thoughts on that.

01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:32.060
Thank you for bringing that up too.

01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:36.820
I did feel like, while the overall installer, it's growing on me, they've had this essential

01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:42.080
one for a little while now, I felt like, so every time I was installing Fedora 21 on every

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:47.380
rig I installed it on, because it's 2014, I already had an operating system installed,

01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:48.380
right?

01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:49.380
It wasn't a blank drive.

01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:56.120
I don't know in what scenario somebody's installing Fedora on a system that's never had another

01:05:56.120 --> 01:06:00.100
operating system, but it probably happens in the server space and stuff, I'll grant

01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:01.100
them that.

01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:06.340
But on the desktop, what Fedora tries to do is it's going to hook you up.

01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:11.020
It doesn't want to mess with you, so it's going to shrink stuff, and it's going to try

01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:14.460
to fit Fedora in some free space for you.

01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:15.780
But I don't want it to do that.

01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:20.920
I want it to wipe out all the partitions and set up, have at it Haas, go for it Fedora.

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:25.020
In order to get to that, you've got to select the drive, and then you've got to go into

01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:30.940
the special reclaim space menu, and then you've got to select the partitions that you're willing

01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:38.060
to reclaim space from, and then when you click that, it doesn't actually represent in the

01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:40.940
visual that you're now reclaiming that space.

01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:45.460
It's not until you click apply that it then represents it, so you don't really get a chance

01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:48.740
to visualize what it is you're about to do before you make the action.

01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:51.180
And the entire time, you're not even sure that's where you're supposed to be making

01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:52.260
that change at.

01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:57.980
And so I felt like the partitioning definitely was one of the rougher areas, but once I wrapped

01:06:57.980 --> 01:07:02.380
my brain around what they were trying to do, every subsequent Fedora install, I didn't

01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:04.380
have a problem.

01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:05.380
Yeah.

01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:10.820
I did try it on another laptop, and I think it worked better, so I think I might just

01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:16.900
try a different USB stick and put some space and give it a better try on another system

01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:18.820
and see how it turns out for me.

01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:22.580
Ra, you had some ButterFS experience feedback?

01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:23.860
Yeah.

01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:31.860
Actually I had a preview set up with OpenSUSE, and there were a couple of ButterFS partitions

01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:38.780
on there, and then I decided to go all in on Fedora 21 even before it came out.

01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:42.900
And that's not happened since I ditched Windows, let me tell you.

01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:48.420
And Fedora, just the partitioning scheme, the editor, messed it up.

01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:55.420
Then I had 20 ButterFS partitions, which all were empty sub-volumes, in the partitioning

01:07:55.420 --> 01:08:01.220
editor, and it actually created all those, and I thought, well, let's do it.

01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:03.500
Maybe it's just a bug.

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:05.380
And then it actually created all those.

01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:10.500
But that was before the release, and they fixed that, so it should work right now.

01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:11.500
I hope it does.

01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:12.500
Yeah.

01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:13.500
All right.

01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:16.540
And Dave, you have a better way for the partitioning?

01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:19.700
Yeah, there are simpler ways to actually do it.

01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:22.460
You just simply delete the partitions.

01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:28.580
The thing about Fedora 21, and most Fedora installs since, I think, the new installer,

01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:32.820
it doesn't actually write changes to your disk until you begin the installation.

01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:34.020
Right, okay.

01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:40.860
So you can make changes whichever way you want by just simply adding and deleting disks

01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:42.660
and deleting partitions.

01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:48.100
When you actually get to the partition menu, which I admit is a little confusing at first,

01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:53.340
but you just press the little minus sign on the bottom and your partitions will be gone,

01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:57.540
and you can write whatever new configuration that you want, any way you want it.

01:08:57.540 --> 01:08:58.780
So there is that.

01:08:58.780 --> 01:09:05.180
Secondly, to WWE NSX's point, I would like to ask him which spin he was using, because

01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:11.780
if he was installing Gnome Tree or something heavy, it might take a very long time, because

01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:18.740
a default Gnome Tree install has, I think, somewhere around 1400 packages to install,

01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:25.340
from the core utilities to all of the Gnome stuff, so obviously it would take a while.

01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:28.380
The advantage, obviously, is that it doesn't download stuff from the internet, so you can

01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:29.380
do it offline.

01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:30.380
Right.

01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:35.540
I also, before we go any further, I just want to make a caveat that Dave, his audio is a

01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:37.220
little crackly.

01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:40.660
He's been experiencing some problems under Linux, when he boots into Windows, the crackle

01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:41.660
goes away.

01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:44.980
So we're troubleshooting that, so we apologize, but you know, it's what happens sometimes

01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:45.980
as Linux users.

01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:47.980
All right, so WWE, did you have a response to that?

01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:55.820
Yeah, I just grabbed a workstation ISO 64-bit off of Fedora's site and just downloaded it,

01:09:55.820 --> 01:10:01.460
put it on the USB drive and just ran it.

01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:07.540
What I think happened is the whole system locked up, because my mouse was movable, I

01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:12.300
was just letting it sit and just format the partition, and at one point it just became

01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:19.500
immovable and I left it until I thought, I'm going to have to hard reboot, and it just

01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:25.620
froze on the formatting of the drive, so that's what happened for me.

01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:29.420
Then obviously, yeah, that was probably an installer bug, that happens from time to time

01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:30.420
to the best of us.

01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:31.420
Yeah, is that true?

01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:35.380
It happens with every disher out there, you have to be careful about that.

01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:39.580
Bugs happen from time to time to the best of us, Raw, you have our closing thought you

01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:41.700
wanted to say?

01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:43.260
Yes.

01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:47.180
Go ahead.

01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:49.340
Go ahead, you have it sir.

01:10:49.340 --> 01:10:50.340
No?

01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:51.340
All right.

01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:56.320
Oh yeah, I'm there, sorry, I didn't push.

01:10:56.320 --> 01:11:00.700
So the Budgie desktop, I'm not sure whether you tried it out, but it's on, it's big on

01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:05.700
Google+, they have a great community, and it's actually quite a good desktop, I wouldn't

01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:09.540
prefer it over GNOME 3, but that's just because I'm used to it.

01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:12.700
Is it Fedora based, or what's it based on?

01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:14.500
It's GTK based, it's GNOME based.

01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:18.700
Right, yeah, I know that, but what's the underlying distro that it's based on?

01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:20.060
Yes, Fedora, I think.

01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:26.740
I don't know what it's based on, but it's at least easily installable on Fedora, just

01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:27.980
to add a repo file.

01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:28.980
Yeah, very good.

01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:31.540
All right, that's another check it out.

01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:34.380
Every now and then, as the holidays come up from time to time, some of you have a little

01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:37.940
extra time on your hands, some of you don't, if you're like me, especially with the three

01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:38.940
kids.

01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:42.420
Tell you what, Matt, I want to move to Texas, I'm going to set up the JB Ranch, I'll have

01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:47.260
all of the hosts come down, they can live on the ranch, I'll be like George Lucas, and

01:11:47.260 --> 01:11:50.060
all of it is just so that way when the family calls up and they're like, hey, are you coming

01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:51.060
to Christmas?

01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:54.940
I'll be like, oh yeah, you know what, sorry, gosh, I'd love to come to Christmas, but you

01:11:54.940 --> 01:11:57.720
know what, I'm in Texas, yeah, I'm in Texas.

01:11:57.720 --> 01:11:58.720
That's what I want to do, Matt.

01:11:58.720 --> 01:11:59.720
What do you think?

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:01.620
Well, you know what would be cool, is when bacon's ready, you could just ring a bell,

01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:02.620
right?

01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:03.620
Yeah.

01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:06.620
And all the hosts come, like, heads pop up out of the kennel, you know, it's like, come

01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:07.620
running in.

01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:10.540
And all the hosts, all the producers, that would get some stuff done.

01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:11.860
I think that's a great idea.

01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:14.380
Well, maybe we'll work that out in 2016.

01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:18.420
In the meantime, go over to Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash contact and send us your feedback, it's

01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:20.660
a huge part of the Linux Unplugged show.

01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:24.260
Also linuxactionshow.reddit.com is where you go to give us your feedback.

01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:27.420
If there was something like, God, why didn't these guys talk about this, these idiots?

01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:32.700
Well, it's probably because you didn't submit it to our subreddit, linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:35.860
Also go over there to Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:39.140
We won't have a live show next week, but we will have a new show, but we need your best

01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:41.860
of submissions, we're still taking those.

01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:43.900
Check it out, we need your help.

01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:48.140
Next week we'll have a new episode of sorts, it'll be some of our best of stuff with some

01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:50.740
moments from me mixed in there.

01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:54.620
So Matt, have a great Christmas, and I'll see you in two weeks, okay?

01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:55.620
Sounds good, see you then.

01:12:55.620 --> 01:12:58.180
All right everybody, thank you so much for tuning in to this week's episode of Linux

01:12:58.180 --> 01:12:59.180
Unplugged.

01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:27.620
We'll be right back here in two weeks.

01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:41.180
I totally, I totally want to mess with Texas.

01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:42.180
Great show.

01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:45.140
That was a good show, great end of year, well of course it's not the end of year, we have

01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:46.700
one more show in us.

01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:49.620
But I feel like this is the last show of the year in a sense.

01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:54.140
The next show, it's like a, I don't know what it is, it's like a freebie.

01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:55.660
But thanks everybody, it was a great input.

01:13:55.660 --> 01:14:01.060
So JBTitles.com, we gotta go boat, boat, everybody go over there right now.

01:14:01.060 --> 01:14:05.500
One thing I'd just like to say, everything you talked about, think about YUM, and YUM

01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:11.700
has its flaws, let me tell you that, but think about YUM, think about SELinux, the installer,

01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:16.340
everything has worked perfectly fine since Fidelity 18.

01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:18.500
Yeah, right, thank you.

01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:23.740
I didn't mean to imply that the SELinux alerts and stuff, and the YUM stuff was new to 21.

01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:29.620
I didn't, so you know, I sometimes assume people know that, and so I don't disclose

01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:34.020
that, and really what I was trying to say is, it's part of the overall experience now

01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:37.300
on 21 is you have all of that stuff combined with everything else.

01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:38.300
Yes, so.

01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:43.940
No, the thing is YUM sucks, YUM is a god damn, and coming from me that's saying something.

01:14:43.940 --> 01:14:44.940
Oh!

01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:48.460
I don't know, I mean it didn't seem that bad, of course I was mostly using DNF, it didn't

01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:49.460
seem that bad.

01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:52.780
Yeah, no, you have to, god damn.

01:14:52.780 --> 01:15:00.660
So I can see it on the internet, that I do not like YUM as much as I like the app.

01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:04.620
That being said, there are certain advantages, and these advantages have been there for a

01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:05.620
very long time.

01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:08.980
I haven't tried using DNF.

01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:14.060
I have, I have a couple of times, it's YUM, it's what YUM should have been.

01:15:14.060 --> 01:15:18.860
I like Lord Wimpy as one of our title suggestions, that's pretty good considering that Wimpy

01:15:18.860 --> 01:15:19.860
is so badass.

01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:25.380
Fedora 21 frags, Misconceptions is a little long.

01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:26.380
That's not bad though.

01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:29.420
It's a little long.

01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:30.420
Like my opinion.

01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:32.900
I'm sorry, it has a little nod to, is it not?

01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:35.260
Yeah, I do like that aspect of it, I do agree.

01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:38.700
Steam's winter is coming, ww, you know where my head's at.

01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:43.060
Wifi enabled micro-brew, that's right Token Ring, paying attention.

01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:45.060
Chris' bacon farm down in Texas.

01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:46.060
Bacon farm?

01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:51.460
I had a question for Wimpy as well, does his remote cloud top work with the brewery?

01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:52.460
The brewery?

01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:53.460
What is it called?

01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:54.460
Sure it does.

01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:55.460
Sure it does.

01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:56.460
The brewery?

01:15:56.460 --> 01:15:57.460
The brewery, I think it is?

01:15:57.460 --> 01:15:58.460
The brewery, yeah.

01:15:58.460 --> 01:15:59.460
I have no idea.

01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:00.460
If you buy me one, I'll test it.

01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:01.460
Yeah, there you go.

01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:02.460
All right, so.

01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:03.460
I can see that becoming popular.

01:16:03.460 --> 01:16:04.460
Christmas is coming.

01:16:04.460 --> 01:16:05.460
Houses.

01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:10.620
I don't mean to over-hype this, but I think we are currently experiencing a title crisis.

01:16:10.620 --> 01:16:14.020
This is the title crisis of 2014 Winter Vortex Edition.

01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:17.060
I don't like any of the titles in the top five ranking right now.

01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:19.540
I need everybody to go to JBtitles.com.

01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:20.660
This is a crisis.

01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:21.660
This is a crisis.

01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:23.940
You are entitled to your wrong opinion.

01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:24.940
I'm entitled.

01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:25.940
Hey yo.

01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:29.780
Hey Wimpy, I like your, what did you call it, cloud top computing, what did you call

01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:30.780
that?

01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:32.660
Yeah, link bait, that's what that was.

01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:33.660
I know, but that was good.

01:16:33.660 --> 01:16:34.660
That was good.

01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:37.300
Yeah, cloud top computing, yeah.

01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:40.580
You know, it reminded me, I was on Tech Talk today, I was telling on the pre-show, I was

01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:45.700
telling a story about five or six years ago, I worked at a school district.

01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:48.940
And not only did they have abysmally slow internet, but they also had really restrictive

01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:51.660
filters, content filters, as you might expect.

01:16:51.660 --> 01:16:55.180
But to the point of where it made it hard to even do some IT troubleshooting and things

01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:56.180
like that.

01:16:56.180 --> 01:16:59.540
Because certain open source projects were flagged, and it was really, even like I think

01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:02.380
for a time, Jupiter Broadcasting was flagged.

01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:04.100
But this was five or six years ago, right?

01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:07.840
This wasn't really in the era of digital ocean droplets anymore.

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:13.900
And so I had a friend who had a data center down in Texas, and he gave me a co-located

01:17:13.900 --> 01:17:14.900
server.

01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:15.900
It was like an Optron box.

01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:19.340
I think it had two Optron processors in it, and about 16 gigabytes of RAM.

01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:24.460
And it was a Red Hat Linux, I think it was Red Hat Enterprise something old.

01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:32.300
And it was a full-fledged like real PC server, like it wasn't a VM, it was a full racked

01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:39.100
box that I was getting for about $120 to $135 a month, including an NFS-attached storage

01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:42.180
array that I had for like big stuff, which was really cool.

01:17:42.180 --> 01:17:46.500
And what I did back then, and I know I think we've talked about this before, Wimpy, is

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:49.060
I didn't use X2GO, which is what you're using.

01:17:49.060 --> 01:17:52.460
I use something called No Machine NX or MX.

01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:53.460
Do you remember this?

01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:54.460
Yeah.

01:17:54.460 --> 01:17:58.020
Yeah, well that's what I'm using at work at the moment, and I'm about to replace with

01:17:58.020 --> 01:17:59.020
X2GO.

01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:00.020
Yeah.

01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:05.260
So from what my experience is with No Machine, again it goes over SSH, it uses pretty good

01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:08.260
compression, it can even do like remote sound.

01:18:08.260 --> 01:18:12.700
You know, I mean it was amazing for me because I essentially had like a Gnome 2 or XFCE style

01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:19.260
desktop, and I could even watch YouTube videos, 20, 30 frames per second maybe if I was lucky,

01:18:19.260 --> 01:18:22.780
and the audio would be synced up, and it was extremely, extremely usable.

01:18:22.780 --> 01:18:26.940
I would close the window, my session would just remain, I would reconnect, I would resume

01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:28.220
right where I left off.

01:18:28.220 --> 01:18:31.220
So what is the main advantage of X2GO over, say, No Machine?

01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:34.100
Because No Machine is still a thing too.

01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:39.500
Yeah, X2GO is just blitzing quick and lighter weight.

01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:47.260
So the core implementation takes about 35 meg of RAM, and when you actually connect

01:18:47.260 --> 01:18:53.140
to a full Ubuntu Mate session, you can run it in 125 meg of RAM.

01:18:53.140 --> 01:19:01.220
And doing that over, I use FreeNX currently with Ubuntu 10.04, we're about to ditch that

01:19:01.220 --> 01:19:09.980
and update, but that uses about twice the RAM, and that's where FreeNX, which is the

01:19:09.980 --> 01:19:13.620
open source implementation of No Machine.

01:19:13.620 --> 01:19:17.160
So yeah, but like you say, you've got all of that good stuff like transparent audio

01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:24.300
relay, so your audio transparently shifts from the remote instance to your local instance.

01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:25.300
Yes, it's very exciting.

01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:29.620
And yes, you can watch SD video from YouTube and what have you.

01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:35.860
But where X2GO starts to differentiate itself is you've got this transparent shunting of

01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:41.100
your directories from your local machine to the remote machine, which all happens over

01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:48.300
SSHFS, and you just right click, share a folder, pick a folder, and then boom, it appears on

01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:52.180
the desktop as a mounted drive on the remote instance.

01:19:52.180 --> 01:19:55.860
Would you be up for doing a segment with us on last, like in January sometime on that?

01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:57.440
Because that is really cool.

01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:00.820
The file system set up like that is definitely very neat.

01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:01.820
I'd love to show people.

01:20:01.820 --> 01:20:02.820
I can.

01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:06.300
I tell you what, maybe we'll want to wait a little bit longer, because since I posted

01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:10.920
about that, I've been talking to DigitalOcean, and I'm now working with their editorial team

01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:16.460
to turn this into a proper tutorial.

01:20:16.460 --> 01:20:20.980
So there's going to be several articles, and I was talking about this in the lobby with

01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:25.780
some of the other guys prior to the stream starting.

01:20:25.780 --> 01:20:29.140
So we're going to do the initial recreating what I've done.

01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:35.420
So as an individual, you can create a droplet and deploy a desktop into it, and I'll explain

01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:38.460
what the potential use cases for that are.

01:20:38.460 --> 01:20:44.100
But then taking it full circle, what we're going to be looking at is if you're a small

01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:52.220
business and you want to control your distributed workforces computing environment, and you've

01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:57.900
got to bring your own device policy, how you can set up centralized authentication for

01:20:57.900 --> 01:21:03.180
these multiple instances, and you know what your fixed costs are per employee per month.

01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:08.100
It's going to cost you 10 bucks a month for a workstation instance, which they can connect

01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:12.220
to from a Mac machine or a Windows machine or a tablet or whatever.

01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:16.080
So just to hold on, just to put you on pause, are you telling me that what you're working

01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:21.740
on is a way to take somebody, say, that has multiple droplets that are desktop instances

01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:26.540
that they connect to where they have a secure place to work, but they would all also have,

01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:30.420
maybe like on the private networking side, a centralized login system, like an open

01:21:30.420 --> 01:21:31.900
ELD app or something?

01:21:31.900 --> 01:21:36.660
Precisely that on the centralized authentication side, but also building on DigitalOcean's

01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:44.300
private networking, the end game is once you've got central authentication and multiple instances

01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:49.780
on a larger droplet, deploying Open Media Vault and using the private networking to

01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:52.620
create a virtual distributed office.

01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:54.220
Oh my gosh.

01:21:54.220 --> 01:21:55.860
That is brilliant.

01:21:55.860 --> 01:21:58.300
Yeah, of course.

01:21:58.300 --> 01:21:59.780
Oh wow.

01:21:59.780 --> 01:22:01.280
Of course you could do that.

01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:04.180
That is so slick.

01:22:04.180 --> 01:22:06.300
That is, that is, I want to do that.

01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:07.300
I want to do that.

01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:08.300
Nice.

01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:09.300
Right, Matt?

01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:10.300
You know what I'm saying?

01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:13.420
That's like, when you hear that, you're like, wait a minute, okay, hold on, who needs computers

01:22:13.420 --> 01:22:14.420
anymore?

01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:15.420
I'm just going to build droplets.

01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:18.020
I'll have an Open Media Vault rig up there.

01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:19.020
Seriously?

01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:20.020
I'll have a Plex rig up there.

01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:21.340
I'm going to do this.

01:22:21.340 --> 01:22:22.340
That is wimpy.

01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:23.680
You've got to tell us how that goes.

01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:24.680
That's really cool.

01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:27.140
It changes the economics of everything, really.

01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:28.140
Quite.

01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:33.220
And what I've got here, what I've been experimenting with is there are a number of thin client solutions,

01:22:33.220 --> 01:22:37.420
and we were talking about some of those earlier, but the one I'm using is I've got a Raspberry

01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:42.260
Pi with, in fact, you know about this, Chris, because Q5Sys gave you one, a Raspberry Pi

01:22:42.260 --> 01:22:46.340
with an Atrix lap dock, and then a wireless dongle.

01:22:46.340 --> 01:22:52.260
The whole thing runs wirelessly off the internal battery for 10 hours, and I've got a minimal

01:22:52.260 --> 01:22:58.420
arch instance on that Raspberry Pi, which boots to open box, automatically starts the

01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:06.820
X2Go client, and then I log in to my remote Ubuntu MATE droplet, and as far as my workstation

01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:13.060
is concerned, I've got a full Ubuntu MATE workstation, far more powerful than the Raspberry

01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:15.020
Pi I'm using to connect to.

01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:17.860
No kidding.

01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:23.900
Talk about taking a Raspberry Pi and just making it, essentially, a transparent shim

01:23:23.900 --> 01:23:30.260
between you and the remote system that has potentially a huge connection, super fast

01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:31.260
SSD.

01:23:31.260 --> 01:23:32.260
That is wimpy.

01:23:32.260 --> 01:23:33.260
Geez, that's cool.

01:23:33.260 --> 01:23:37.860
And a Raspberry Pi is like a super cheap version of this, but when you look at these deployments

01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:45.100
that are happening where Windows is being replaced with a Linux desktop, it's not being

01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:48.620
replaced with a Linux desktop on that Windows machine.

01:23:48.620 --> 01:23:54.580
By and large, they are remote terminal services, and that Windows machine is being repurposed

01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:56.060
as a thin client.

01:23:56.060 --> 01:24:03.060
So this is how you can bridge that gap and minimize your hardware expenditure.

01:24:03.060 --> 01:24:08.780
This pushes so many buttons for me, because remote desktops used to be something that

01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:14.500
not only did I... So I took what was once the largest independent bank here in Washington,

01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:19.700
which is no longer the case after 2008, but we moved them from DOS to terminal services.

01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:23.500
But then I went to school districts and did Linux terminal services project.

01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:27.100
And then when I was working for the school district, I did the no machine thing for myself.

01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:31.620
And what you're talking about right now is so up my alley.

01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:35.700
It is like my bag, so I really want you to keep me updated on this, because I would love

01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:38.500
... Not only would I love to just talk to you about this, but I would love to even show

01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:43.940
people how to do this, because this could be seriously a way to show people that watch

01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:49.980
the Linux action show, a very straightforward, very cost-effective way to build out a remote

01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:51.940
Linux-based desktop.

01:24:51.940 --> 01:24:56.260
Doesn't matter if all of their employees want to have Macbooks and iPads and iPhones.

01:24:56.260 --> 01:24:57.260
That's fine.

01:24:57.260 --> 01:25:01.620
But when you log in to do the work, you log into our secure environment under control,

01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:05.980
under our control, up in the cloud, connected over private networking to our internal resources.

01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:06.980
Exactly.

01:25:06.980 --> 01:25:12.360
And that solves your bring your own device IT governance problem right there, and your

01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:16.820
file format compatibility problem with Mac users with one version of Microsoft Office

01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:23.300
and Windows users with another Microsoft Office version, and it just solves all of that.

01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:24.740
Wow, that's slick.

01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:25.740
Wow.

01:25:25.740 --> 01:25:29.660
And the other piece, a little bit further out, because this is in the unstable branch

01:25:29.660 --> 01:25:36.100
at the moment, and I mentioned it a few weeks ago, but there's a bolt-on protocol for ExtaGo

01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:44.900
called Telekinesis, and that's a general purpose protocol, but it was really developed to facilitate

01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:46.820
a mTeleplayer.

01:25:46.820 --> 01:25:53.380
So now what you can do is you can have full HD content on the remote instance, and instead

01:25:53.380 --> 01:26:00.540
of using the ExtaGo protocol to send the rendered video, it actually streams the video back

01:26:00.540 --> 01:26:05.020
to your remote machine, but in a window, and it looks like it's being rendered on the remote

01:26:05.020 --> 01:26:08.500
machine, but it's not, it's actually the video's being streamed.

01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:15.580
So I'll just go off and find a little video, there's a video of two full HD screens running

01:26:15.580 --> 01:26:18.860
a 4K video over ExtaGo and mTeleplayer.

01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:19.860
No, no.

01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:23.780
Yeah, I'll just go and find it, it's on YouTube, hang on a sec, I'll be back, I'll be back

01:26:23.780 --> 01:26:24.780
in a bit.

01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:26.580
Wow, that is amazing.

01:26:26.580 --> 01:26:32.020
This feels like we're getting like ice cream with our pie, and getting like double scoops.

01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:35.940
So you guys know I've been trying out this touch screen for a little bit.

01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:41.180
And it's pretty solid, surprising, it's surprisingly good.

01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:47.500
I'm happy overall with the picture quality, one thing that I have noticed is, you know,

01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:53.560
it's like the things you don't expect, I guess thinking about it, when I got this monitor,

01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:59.140
my plan was to fix up one of the old hackintoshes that I used to use as the switcher, it's a

01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:02.420
pretty nice hackintosh, and I thought, alright, I'm going to fix this up, I'm going to make

01:27:02.420 --> 01:27:07.340
it an arch box, and then I'll put that under the table, and I'll take the Bonobo home.

01:27:07.340 --> 01:27:11.820
Because, you know, I bought it to be able to do quite a heavy video load, so it's still,

01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:15.340
even though it was a couple of years ago, it still makes a pretty good, like, just dedicated

01:27:15.340 --> 01:27:17.020
GNOME workstation.

01:27:17.020 --> 01:27:21.580
And I would just have that hooked up to the Dell monitor and the other mirrored port going

01:27:21.580 --> 01:27:24.540
out to the HDMI capture.

01:27:24.540 --> 01:27:28.100
But you know, it needs some work, it needs like some data has to be backed up off of

01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:33.740
it, and it needs fans replaced, and it just has, like, stuff that has to be done to it.

01:27:33.740 --> 01:27:35.380
It just, I'm not getting to that.

01:27:35.380 --> 01:27:39.980
So I realized, well, you know, this Bonobo here, this frickin' Bonobo's got HDMI out,

01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:43.020
display port out, and a built-in screen.

01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:47.380
I've always wondered, as long as I've owned the Bonobo, would the Bonobo be down for a

01:27:47.380 --> 01:27:48.980
three-way monitor hookup?

01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:52.820
I've never, you know, I've always been a little cautious about, I didn't want to approach

01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:57.100
the Bonobo and be like, hey, Bonobos, I got this idea, and then the Bonobo would be like,

01:27:57.100 --> 01:27:58.620
are you serious?

01:27:58.620 --> 01:28:03.540
When my HDMI port is full, that display port is off, buddy, that is off limits.

01:28:03.540 --> 01:28:06.380
But it turns out, it actually works great.

01:28:06.380 --> 01:28:11.020
I plugged in both the display port and the HDMI port, they're filled up now, and the

01:28:11.020 --> 01:28:17.260
internal screen's also on, and it works magically, I mean, it really works well.

01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:23.780
The downside though, and I'm running the latest Nvidia driver here, but from time to time,

01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:30.660
you know, about seven, eight days in, the driver just starts crapping itself.

01:28:30.660 --> 01:28:34.540
I don't know what exactly is going on, because usually it seems to happen right after I get

01:28:34.540 --> 01:28:37.200
done playing a full-screen video.

01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:43.820
And then the X session drops, GNOME restarts, well, the X session comes back, GNOME restarts,

01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:47.460
fairly gracefully, everything actually kind of resumes, you know?

01:28:47.460 --> 01:28:51.820
All my apps are still running, it's not like a full jump out, it's more like something

01:28:51.820 --> 01:28:53.020
just changes.

01:28:53.020 --> 01:28:58.540
And I go back to the default X layout, I no longer am in a three-way, I'm now back to

01:28:58.540 --> 01:29:03.300
one monitor, and then two remote displays, well that immediately breaks capture.

01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:09.820
And the thing is, if I'm playing a full-screen video, there's like a 98.9% chance that I'm

01:29:09.820 --> 01:29:13.380
actually in the middle of a show, because that's why I'm playing the video.

01:29:13.380 --> 01:29:18.220
So that means my whole session takes a crap in the middle of a show, and the only way

01:29:18.220 --> 01:29:23.220
to fix it is if I get up and walk away from the microphone, and I walk around the table,

01:29:23.220 --> 01:29:27.060
and I go over to the Bonobo, and I go there and I bring up the NVIDIA control panel on

01:29:27.060 --> 01:29:32.860
the Bonobo's display, and I mirror everything again, and then I walk back.

01:29:32.860 --> 01:29:35.460
So it's been a bit of a bumpy ride because of that.

01:29:35.460 --> 01:29:39.500
So the touchscreen, on its own, has been pretty solid.

01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:45.460
The unexpected consequence, though, of forcing my video card into a three-way has been not

01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:49.700
so stable drivers that seem to impact me about seven or eight days, just about the time you

01:29:49.700 --> 01:29:53.880
forget the problem even exists, and think it's maybe not going to happen again, BOOM!

01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:57.640
It gets you right in the middle of a, I don't know, unfilter, and then Rekai has to fix

01:29:57.640 --> 01:29:58.640
it in editing.

01:29:58.640 --> 01:29:59.640
That happened.

01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:00.640
Um.

01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:03.640
Have you considered using a different desktop environment?

01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:04.640
Pfft!

01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:05.640
No!

01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:06.640
Cri...

01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:17.420
Cri...
