1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,760
We've been keeping an eye on the Steam Deck, and it seems Valve has updated their Arch

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,980
install to be basically fully up-to-date.

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,340
They're syncing it up with upstream Arch.

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,740
Some people start to speculate it might never happen.

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,460
Wait, they're going to do updates, right?

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,460
Yeah.

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,300
KDE 5.26 is landing in there.

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,620
There's new themes and new wallpapers.

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,580
That new fancy update to K-Runner.

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:32,320
I wonder, guys, do you think we're getting close to an actual public release of SteamOS

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,320
for regular PCs?

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,760
Do you think it'll get there before the end of the year?

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,760
No.

14
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,760
Really?

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,760
Come on.

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,760
This is Valve time.

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,760
Save it for your prediction, Chris.

18
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,800
I predict it's going to come out before our predictions episode, actually.

19
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,800
Whoa.

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,800
Prediction prediction?

21
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,800
Yeah.

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,000
I think it's going to come out around Christmas break time for schools and stuff.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,200
What are you basing this on?

24
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,200
Just this one update?

25
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,320
Well, I mean, because why else go through all the trouble of getting everything else

26
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,160
synced up with upstream at this point and not do an update?

27
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,480
Because otherwise, you're going to have to do this all over again before you release.

28
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,880
So you think this is the hurry up, you know, a little quick spit shine and then...

29
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,880
Yeah.

30
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,440
And then they release the public ISO around like a week or two before Christmas and people

31
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,880
that are home for the holidays get to play around with it.

32
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,280
I mean, it's a Valvey kind of thing to do, right?

33
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,840
It's Valvey to me.

34
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:38,000
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
My name is Chris.

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
My name is Wes.

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And my name is Brent.

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,920
Well, hello, gentlemen, coming up on the show today.

39
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,760
We're taking a look at Fedora 37.

40
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,000
Is this the one that breaks their streak?

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We'll chat about that.

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,080
Plus, it seems Ubuntu is quietly moving away from ZFS.

43
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,680
We'll see what's going on there.

44
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,520
And then we'll take a test and see if these two can tell the difference between real Chris

45
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,700
and AI generated Chris.

46
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,160
And then we'll round it all out with some great boos, some feedback, some pics, and

47
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,460
a lot more.

48
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,120
So before we go any further, let's say time appropriate greetings to our virtual lug.

49
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,120
Hello, Mama Root!

50
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,120
Hi, friends.

51
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,120
Good evening, guys.

52
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,120
Greetings.

53
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,120
Hello.

54
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,120
Hello.

55
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,120
Thank you for being here.

56
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,120
Thank you.

57
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,120
Very nice.

58
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,120
Very nice.

59
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,120
Got a good crew in there.

60
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,120
Good crew up in the quiet listening as well.

61
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,880
I also want to say good morning to our friends over at TailScale, a mesh VPN powered by WireGuard.

62
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,320
It's a game changer.

63
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,800
If you were early to Linux, you remember that time when people didn't know about how great

64
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,840
Linux was and you knew you were onto something great and everybody else hadn't figured it

65
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,840
out yet?

66
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,540
That's how I feel about TailScale.

67
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,600
So go over to TailScale and try it out.

68
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,600
Say good morning.

69
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,480
You get it for free up to 20 devices at TailScale.com.

70
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,720
If you get a chance, tell them the unplugged program sent you.

71
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,080
Wes Payne, you're running Fedora 37 right there.

72
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,080
Of course.

73
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,640
What else would I be running?

74
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,760
I've got Fedora 37 right here on the Dev 1, which has been an interesting journey.

75
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,760
We'll get to that.

76
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,560
And Brentley, you've been running Fedora 37, but a slightly different spin.

77
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,300
You've been using the Plasma Edition.

78
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,840
It's true.

79
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,840
I assume you went GNOME.

80
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,840
Oh, yeah.

81
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,840
Yeah.

82
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,640
So Wes and I went GNOME, and Brentley went the Plasma Edition.

83
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,720
Well, he protests when we make him use GNOME, so it's just simpler this way for everyone.

84
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,720
He needed a break.

85
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,680
And honestly, we need to try to represent the Plasma users out there that are considering

86
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,440
these updates, because I realized we kind of had a blind spot with the Ubuntu Mate spin.

87
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,200
We just really focused on the main Ubuntu release, and sometimes the spins have something

88
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,200
really great in there.

89
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,200
True.

90
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,200
True.

91
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,520
So Fedora 37 was pretty delayed.

92
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,620
I don't think they like that term, because they basically have a window.

93
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,080
It spans several weeks.

94
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,640
It's ready when it's ready.

95
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,080
And in this case, things got delayed by a flaw in OpenSSL.

96
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,680
So the Fedora team decided to delay the release, so that way they could fix that and get the

97
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,800
updated package in there.

98
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
And so it pushed it.

99
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,120
We're like slow sockets.

100
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,560
Super slow, right?

101
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,600
It pushed it to this week, as this episode is coming out.

102
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,600
What?

103
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,600
Is it like Wednesday?

104
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
I don't know.

105
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,860
The ISOs are final.

106
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,000
And we've been kicking the tires throughout the entire beta process, and then we kind

107
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,960
of go in deep in this last week or so.

108
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:26,160
Fedora 37, I'd say off the top, is a tricky blank canvas to talk about.

109
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,480
This is hard to review, because quite frankly, not a lot going on in here, but there's some

110
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,480
good bones.

111
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,200
It is a showcase for GNOME 43.

112
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,200
Yeah.

113
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,200
It's been a little bit since I used like super up-to-date GNOME.

114
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,200
Ooh.

115
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,200
Ooh.

116
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,200
This is...

117
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,200
It just feels solid.

118
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,000
Everything is snappy AF.

119
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's just...

120
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,580
It feels like a very first-class desktop.

121
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,880
It's got that new quick settings menu, which I love, and that's been super handy.

122
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,520
And then several iterations now really all come together in the GNOME system settings,

123
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,920
where there's just a bunch of good new stuff in there.

124
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,600
And like you said, this is GTK 4.

125
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,800
We're doing a lot of video acceleration now there for that stuff when we can.

126
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,680
And they also shipped Raspberry Pi 4 support.

127
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,560
Fortunately, every time I went to test that, there were issues with the images either not

128
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,840
being available or whatever.

129
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,180
Which happens as we try to pre-review a release.

130
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,860
But I will give it a go when I can.

131
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,960
My take is a little darker, a little sadder, a little more disappointed than it normally

132
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,960
is.

133
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,840
I think really since Fedora 32, I've been coming on here after a Fedora release, and

134
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,020
I've been saying, this is probably worth updating to.

135
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:46,120
And I cannot really articulate a reason to upgrade to Fedora 37 outside of the update

136
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,680
to GNOME 43.

137
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,200
And that's even with a pretty big caveat, because if you've got a good GNOME setup right

138
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:56,840
now on 35 or 36, and you've got extensions you like, I'd just stick there for a while

139
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,080
because most of my extensions broke.

140
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,080
Very few of them are working at this point.

141
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,240
So I don't have some basic things like status menu icons and things like that.

142
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,520
So I really am not really a big fan of this release, because it felt like they took it

143
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,160
more than they gave it in some regards.

144
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:18,880
This is the release where we lose hardware video acceleration for H.264 and some other

145
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,120
codecs.

146
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,640
And unfortunately, the change to remove the flat hub filtering doesn't land in 37.

147
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,720
It's been postponed to 38.

148
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:33,800
So the software situation in this release of Fedora is a major step back.

149
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:40,680
And it makes the software ecosystem on Ubuntu with PPAs and deb files and snaps seem simple

150
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,920
compared to what Fedora offers now.

151
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,140
I had a horrendous experience.

152
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:50,580
It was just a huge hot mess, because I went to go set up my machine and I searched for

153
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,600
Slack and I got nothing in GNOME software.

154
00:06:53,600 --> 00:07:01,520
And I searched for Telegram and I got a GNOME web link that it would install for me.

155
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,520
I closed the application.

156
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,000
This is, mind you, days after I've been using it.

157
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,960
It's not like the first time I ran GNOME software.

158
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,840
I closed the application, I relaunched it again.

159
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:14,360
This time I do the same search and I get a flat hub result.

160
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,760
Totally different set of results.

161
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,440
And it's just really just confusing, because the icons are missing, they don't have the

162
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,320
right vendor icons, it's not clear who published it, it's hard to trust if any of it's legit

163
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,960
when I just searched a minute ago and got a web link.

164
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,120
And now I get an application, but the application's missing the icon and I can't tell who the

165
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,500
publisher is.

166
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,320
And this is just a hot mess of software.

167
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,200
And there's some things that are on flat hub that I search for that I can't get really

168
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,420
common stuff, really basic stuff that you'd want to get off of flat hub that are just

169
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,960
not available in GNOME software.

170
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:55,660
And then they've chosen to partake in parts of RPM Fusion, but not all of RPM Fusion.

171
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:00,740
So for some reason I can install the NVIDIA proprietary driver from RPM Fusion, but nothing

172
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,200
else works.

173
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:09,020
And for some reason that's okay, but yet raw access to flat hub has to be protected.

174
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,720
So why can't we just set up all of RPM Fusion or all of flat hub?

175
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:17,280
And if they're working on a proposal to bring all of flat hub unfiltered to Fedora 38, why

176
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,920
can't I have RPM Fusion too?

177
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,540
What's the difference?

178
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,680
There is no difference.

179
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,880
The difference is, and you can see it in their discussion thread, the legal team just tells

180
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,880
them no.

181
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,080
Nope, you can do flat hub, but you can't do RPM Fusion.

182
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,080
Why?

183
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,360
We can't tell you.

184
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:40,240
And it's another example of how this distribution gets jerked around by lawyers at IBM that

185
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,680
decide what features can and cannot ship in Fedora.

186
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,100
And it's really disappointing because it affects even this experience of using software, not

187
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,700
to mention the issue we have with video codecs.

188
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,980
So the software situation is just sort of this result of the Fedora project has been

189
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,220
making transitions.

190
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,120
There's been a focus on flat packs.

191
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,700
There has been a discussion internally if they should be using their own flat pack repo

192
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,580
and then putting that in front of flat hub and then defaulting after that to flat hub

193
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,580
and then after that to RPMs.

194
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,860
And they've been sorting this whole thing out.

195
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,260
They couldn't get it figured out in time for release.

196
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:17,740
And the end result is it's a mess and it's just not a good experience as an end user.

197
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:23,960
And it's really frustrating because between the video codecs missing and this software

198
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:30,300
experience being so subpar, it feels like we just took five, six years back in terms

199
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,300
of usability there.

200
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,040
And that's my downside with it.

201
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:39,200
The upside is that it is a great blank slate in which you can build a fantastic workstation

202
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,340
on.

203
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,280
And so I'm curious if you guys got to that point.

204
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,280
How far did you make it?

205
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:49,340
Yeah, I mean, I just sort of, I think you're right, the flat hub stuff is confusing, especially

206
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:53,540
if you want to come in for a, like, I just expect this to work.

207
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,340
I sort of assumed I would just have to, like I do on most places, end up having to like

208
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:02,640
get maybe flat pack itself going, but at least flat hub, you know, as a repository enabled.

209
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,300
So once I was over that hurdle, it kind of got, you know, working pretty well.

210
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,980
I was actually outside of the initial setup problems, I was kind of surprised by how few

211
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,340
problems I had with GNOME software these days.

212
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:17,260
Like it feels way faster than it used to feel, like I can switch back and forth, it finds

213
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,060
the search goes pretty quick.

214
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,540
I still love the integration with the various parts of my system.

215
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:27,340
It feels like a nice, I don't know if I, I don't think I've installed any software on

216
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:30,060
the command line this time around, which is not my normal go to.

217
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,140
I mean, I just pop up a terminal most times because I'm lazy and I know how to do it that

218
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,140
way.

219
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:38,000
I was also, I continue to be pleased with just as everything keeps getting updated and

220
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,060
revved in the last couple Fedora releases, it feels like more and more of the little

221
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,660
edge cases have been worked out.

222
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,940
Like I think like where Pipewire and some of the GNOME plumbing and just on the desktop

223
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,180
as a whole feels, feels really nice.

224
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,620
Like Pulse, who cares anymore?

225
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,220
Like I just, this stuff works so well, I, it feels, I don't feel limited.

226
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,820
There was a time where I was like, Fedora, could I make it like a, like a creator space

227
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,700
for me that felt like maybe there's some hurdles, but with Pipewire, like there's a ton of stuff

228
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:10,180
in the repos, like Helvam, the Rust GTK patch bay thing that lets you, you know, drag inputs

229
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,380
and outputs around that works with Pipewire, packaged in Fedora.

230
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,740
And if it's packaged in Fedora, like, you know, it's, it's, it's recent, it's new.

231
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,220
Like I don't have to complain about it.

232
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,220
So that made it.

233
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,340
That does, that does make it nice as a workstation.

234
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,340
Yeah.

235
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,820
So once I got over a little bit and, you know, I had to go remind myself, how do I get Nick's

236
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:29,780
packages going on Fedora without disabling SC Linux and some of that, you know, so there's

237
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,780
a couple of things.

238
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,740
But once I got all the initial setup, you're right.

239
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:37,660
Like I like the system, everything feels real solid, you know, they've got system D tuned

240
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,660
really nicely.

241
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,940
They've got the desktop plumbed really nicely, up-to-date software.

242
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,080
So yeah, I don't know if the hurdle, there's more hurdles now, I guess.

243
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,900
But if you are an experienced user, you probably expect that already.

244
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:56,060
I think Fedora 37 benefits from years of good choices under the hood.

245
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,180
And so there's a lot there to work with.

246
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,820
I'll talk more about how sometimes it doesn't always come together in the end, but I wanted

247
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:06,860
to ask you, did you end up getting Nick's packages working on Fedora 37 or are you using

248
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,260
that to manage software right now?

249
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,180
Yeah, I didn't do, I just wanted to see, you know, go through the process.

250
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,980
I didn't install a bunch of stuff through Nick's or anything.

251
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,580
Mostly I'd mostly have flat packs on this because I've been using it as a, you know,

252
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,340
casual desktop, getting a little bit of work done here and there.

253
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:25,500
I think the one thing I installed, VS code just as a raw dog RPM, actually, because I

254
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,620
don't know, sometimes the flat pack doesn't feel worth it for that one, just because if

255
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,340
you want to dump a bunch of runtimes on your system with that layer is sometimes more trouble

256
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,340
than it's worth.

257
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:37,540
But other than that, it's been flat packs in the repo and, you know, I just wanted to

258
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,380
play around with Nick's because these days I just install it everywhere.

259
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,220
So you enabled flat hub, just full flat hub.

260
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,220
I tried it at first.

261
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,640
I was like, oh, this is not getting me the results I want.

262
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,980
And I figured on most, you know, some desktops, like you got to install flat pack itself

263
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,700
first and then enable flat hub.

264
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,940
So by comparison, yeah, it's quicker.

265
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,300
And they have a Fedora specific section on the site and you can just download the repo

266
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,780
thing and it installs it graphically.

267
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:05,160
I took it on as a challenge to not add the full RPM fusion repo or flat hub repo for

268
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,220
a while just to see what that experience was, to see what they were shipping.

269
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:15,860
And it's not great because if you do want to get to that stuff, if there's no instructions

270
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,420
on how to actually officially do it, so one of the things you got to do is just follow

271
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:23,420
some random instructions on Reddit that tell you to install these packages from RPM fusion

272
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,300
and supposedly they'll add hardware accelerated decoding back.

273
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,900
But it's like, which Reddit thread do you pick?

274
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,860
I mean, I picked the one I picked, I'll put in the show notes, but I can't believe as

275
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:36,400
a Fedora user, that's what I'm being reduced to is finding random Reddit threads.

276
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:42,140
But I did notice there was a codec section at the G streamer one in the store.

277
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:45,580
I don't know if that's only there if you enable third party repositories at the install.

278
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,660
But yeah, I think so.

279
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,620
But the nice thing is also is it will take you there when you go to when you first go

280
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,620
to play.

281
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,580
So I'll walk you through the scenario because here's the here's the scenario I recreated

282
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:58,860
and then I want to hear Brent's plasma experience, but the scenario I created is I filmed a video

283
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,740
on my phone and then I took that video.

284
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,740
Was it a Levi video?

285
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,740
Of course.

286
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,740
Okay.

287
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,420
I took that video and I put it on my laptop and I wanted to watch the video on my laptop.

288
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,460
It's 2022.

289
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,460
Everybody has a smartphone with a camera.

290
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,860
All of those cameras are recording in HD 64.

291
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,180
It transferred to my laptop.

292
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,220
It does not play.

293
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,220
That's a failure.

294
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:24,420
However, it does then walk you through the process of searching Gnome software.

295
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:28,140
And if you have the third party repos installed, you can install the G streamer codec that

296
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,100
has HD 64 playback.

297
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:35,980
I don't believe it's hardware accelerated because I got a I got a dev one here and I

298
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:42,740
was like pegging out like 40 50 percent watching a video from my phone.

299
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,240
But it installs it and then it begins playing immediately.

300
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,340
It's even a slightly smoother than it used to be back in the old days when I used to

301
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:53,660
buy my fluendo codecs and then add them back when we used to not have codecs on Linux.

302
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,940
It's a little bit smoother than that.

303
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:55,940
I had to.

304
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,940
I don't know if it was a flu.

305
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,940
I already had it open.

306
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,940
I had to restart Firefox to get it.

307
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,940
Hmm.

308
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,940
I just installed it right now as we're doing it.

309
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,940
Yeah.

310
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,940
Yeah.

311
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,940
Yeah.

312
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,940
But after that, I mean, yeah, watching Jupiter Tube.

313
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,940
So.

314
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,940
Right.

315
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,380
So, Brantley, I want to hear about your experience.

316
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,380
I know you tried plasma.

317
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,520
I don't know if any of this stuff bit you.

318
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,620
If maybe you're sticking with Fedora 37.

319
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,220
How'd it go, sir?

320
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,220
Yeah.

321
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:20,180
Well, one of our parameters that we kind of toyed with was not changing any of the repos,

322
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,760
not adding flathood, things like that.

323
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,740
So I thought that's a great challenge.

324
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:28,660
But then I kind of suffered for it.

325
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,980
So I had a quite a hard time.

326
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,980
Yeah.

327
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:37,060
I actually really suffered with that and I didn't expect that because I was just trying

328
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:41,660
to do really simple stuff like I wasn't able to find VLC.

329
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,660
I don't know.

330
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,660
Maybe I'm broken.

331
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:48,180
I couldn't find it anywhere to install, which seems odd.

332
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,220
I don't know why that is.

333
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:56,140
But to test the video playing, like you mentioned, Chris, I installed MPV and it must have taken

334
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:02,860
care of everything because H264 played just fine for me, actually, which was good.

335
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:07,980
But I just ran into a whole bunch of issues even from the very beginning, which was unfortunate.

336
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,220
I was really looking forward to having a great experience.

337
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:16,500
And some of it was like a day or two before those official releases were out.

338
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,820
Some of it was after and just continued, which is sort of unfortunate.

339
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:25,160
So one of the main things I ran into, well, I guess I should give some stats first.

340
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:30,560
So it was running Plasma 5.262 as far as I can find.

341
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,940
The latest is 5.263.

342
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,020
So pretty darn recent.

343
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:37,640
I think 5.263 just got released on the 8th.

344
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,640
So a few days ago.

345
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:45,780
But I ran into some issues that have sort of been my experience with KD the last six

346
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:50,580
months on various OSes, unfortunately.

347
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:56,760
So one of the main ones was that the lock screen after being suspended, when you try

348
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,520
to wake it up, was just a complete mess of distortion.

349
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:04,020
And Chris, I included a few screenshots for you in our doc there so that you could kind

350
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,060
of have a look at them.

351
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,140
And it was bizarre because the mouse pointer was perfectly fine.

352
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:11,500
But everything else was like this jarble mess.

353
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,020
I was able to find a workaround.

354
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:19,720
So I was able to use the old control alt F1 and F2 and F3 to kind of bounce between terminals

355
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,740
and get back to the screen.

356
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,940
And then it's presented just fine.

357
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,940
So that was an interesting experience.

358
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:33,700
And it just kind of persisted between restarts and was unfortunate.

359
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:40,180
And I had just application crashes out of nowhere and some notifications that came up

360
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,660
immediately just suggesting that things were broken.

361
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:47,260
And so I actually didn't get very far before losing all of my enthusiasm.

362
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,980
And that got me thinking about spins in a bigger context.

363
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:56,180
And I feel like the main release, especially with their release window, tends to focus

364
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:00,940
on the GNOME implementation, which is logical.

365
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,220
But it gets me thinking about spins and how they're at kind of the mercy of that release

366
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,220
cycle.

367
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,020
And sometimes they have to release maybe when they're not quite ready.

368
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,100
I would be interested in knowing a little bit more about how that works on the back

369
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,100
end.

370
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:16,580
But I feel like using the spins on release day is just rough, really, really rough.

371
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:20,900
Maybe it's better in a month or two, and I'd be interested in looking at that.

372
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,980
I don't disagree with you on that.

373
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:29,180
I know that Neil would tell us that the Fedora project has made critical bugs in Plasma a

374
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,940
release blocker for all the spins.

375
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,580
But my experience has also just been that it doesn't have the same focus.

376
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,340
I think that probably could be a topic we could dig down on in the future.

377
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,340
You mentioned errors.

378
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,540
Do you think they were SE Linux errors that you were getting?

379
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,660
No, they weren't SE Linux errors.

380
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:50,980
I think I meant to screen grab them, and then I had the other issues and just they got lost

381
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,980
in the mix.

382
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,580
But yeah, I can't speak to them.

383
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,380
Maybe I'll have another look and find them.

384
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:02,380
But they didn't seem to affect at least what I can tell, the operation of the OS, it seemed

385
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,380
just fine.

386
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,940
Might have been a notification subsystem error.

387
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,060
Hey, I'll take viewer notifications as a good thing.

388
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:13,660
Yeah, you still want to get the important ones though, don't you?

389
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:20,060
This is an interesting sort of pause in what has been, in my opinion, really strong releases,

390
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:23,860
especially starting at 32 and 33 when ButterFS came in.

391
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,140
And I think it's still a really solid base.

392
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,300
I don't know if it's worth upgrading today.

393
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:32,500
I'd probably, if it was me, I'd probably wait a month or two at least.

394
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:39,940
Unfortunately, sort of ironically timed, after the show today, I am playing tech support

395
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,420
for my son.

396
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:46,540
I installed Fedora 36 on his Asus laptop.

397
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:50,380
It's been working great for a long time.

398
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:55,620
Until about a month or two ago, and it started to just slowly have issue after issue.

399
00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:01,060
One of the first problems that crept up was his Nvidia binary driver just broke.

400
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,980
It seems to almost segfault during boot or something, and then the nouveau driver has

401
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,980
to load.

402
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,420
So it does fall back.

403
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,860
It's not like it totally fails to come up.

404
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,620
But he uses it to game, so it's kind of a downside.

405
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:15,340
So then it starts up and you're like, wait, why is my gaming suddenly way worse?

406
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,340
Yeah.

407
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:20,940
And of course he's always paying attention to the frames per second and whatnot.

408
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:26,520
So this weekend, this is on Fedora 36, I just took all the Nvidia stuff off, went totally

409
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,700
back to a free driver stack, completely back to stock.

410
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,100
And then went into GNOME software, made sure I had the repos enabled and all that kind

411
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:39,820
of stuff, and reinstalled it from following their prescribed process, and I'm still having

412
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,820
issues with it.

413
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:46,920
But on top of that, when he shuts down now, it hangs at like KVM trying to do some sort

414
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,520
of KVM hardware shutdown process.

415
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,580
And his system just hangs there forever, and he has to hard physically turn it off.

416
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,820
And of course, he's doing that more and more, because it also doesn't sleep anymore when

417
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,140
he closes the lid.

418
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:02,820
It did when he first started using it, but it no longer does.

419
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:07,740
And this morning, I found out that now some sort of process in the background is just

420
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,100
going absolutely crazy.

421
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,540
I would not be surprised if it isn't related to KVM.

422
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:16,860
And his fans are going crazy, his CPU is getting pegged.

423
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:23,540
It just seems to me that Fedora 36 just didn't turn out to be as durable as I wanted, because

424
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:28,100
he only installs stuff from Steam, and he just does the system updates.

425
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,020
That's all he's doing.

426
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:34,900
And he had elementary OS for like three years, and it was fine.

427
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,660
We just moved because it was an old base, and he was getting a new machine.

428
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:41,540
And at the time, I was like, Fedora seems to be working really well.

429
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:46,080
But I'm concerned about this durability issue, because I'm not really clear what he's done

430
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,940
other than, I've looked at it, it's just updates, and things broke.

431
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,420
And I think that means it's probably not going to be the family OS for me.

432
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:59,540
And I really hate that, because I like just that clean blank slate that I can build a

433
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,540
little family setup on.

434
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:04,260
I mean, obviously, like, right, there's LTS, there's lots of options here, but it felt

435
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:09,980
like in a certain stride, like the updates, the update process itself, just everything

436
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:13,780
kind of coming together, reaching a very cohesive whole, like that even though, yes, there are

437
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:17,420
more updates in the Fedora model, you can still feel kind of comfortable being like...

438
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:21,980
You know, I'm glad you brought that up, because I say elementary OS was fine, but we were

439
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,460
starting to have packages that were like...

440
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:28,660
You can no longer get an updated enough version from the repo to support this.

441
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:33,080
Or like a repo was no longer online, because it was like a, you know, probably a four-year-old

442
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,080
distro by that point.

443
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,080
Yeah.

444
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,080
Was that the 1804?

445
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,080
Probably.

446
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:41,100
Yeah, it was probably the 1804 base, and it was about a year ago.

447
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,220
And everything still installs, right?

448
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:47,860
DNF completes, everything's good, every package is still working, all the dependencies are

449
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,900
resolved, there's nothing broken in regards to like package management, which is honestly

450
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,020
what I was trying to solve for, because I was very frustrated, because ultimately what

451
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,740
happened to elementary OS, I couldn't update Chrome, he couldn't use something he needed

452
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,700
for school, blah, blah, blah.

453
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,700
Right.

454
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,540
One too many PPAs, some weird stuff happened, who knows anymore.

455
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,540
Yeah.

456
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:09,900
I solved for that with Fedora, and it's working well, but it's just disappointed me in this

457
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,900
way.

458
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:17,300
My exit interview for Fedora 36 is, if you're a sysadmin, you're set, it's going to be fine,

459
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:21,540
but I can't recommend it for the set-it-and-forget-it-family type computers, because it has not been that,

460
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:26,840
and this has not been problem-free the entire install, about once every couple of months

461
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:31,980
I'm fixing something for them, you know, two or three times, not the end of the world,

462
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,340
but it's also, I think, honestly it shook his confidence a little bit in desktop Linux

463
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,700
as a result, which is kind of, which was not great, you know, because we were doing really

464
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:45,940
good, but when he sees the frame rate drop, and you know, he's having issues with it not

465
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:49,700
shutting down, and he closes the lid, puts it in his bag, and he pulls it out, it's like

466
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:55,720
110 degrees, and the battery's drained, you know, that's a bad experience.

467
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,380
And now if I were to put Fedora 37 on there, and not set it up for him, you know, if he

468
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:05,540
were to just try upgrading to fix it, he would upgrade, and he would lose video accelerated

469
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:11,260
playback, and he has an AMD graphics in there too, he's got both, and that's just, that's

470
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,260
a hard sell.

471
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:15,220
I mean, could you imagine trying to tell him that?

472
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,900
How do I even explain that to him?

473
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,700
I don't think you would, you'd probably just end up in stock, you know, tell him I gotta

474
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:24,300
do a couple maintenance upgrades real quick before you use this, bud.

475
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:28,400
Now I have a question for you both, or maybe it's more of a pondering.

476
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,940
We've seen some of the major distributions, like Fedora for instance, we were excited

477
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:37,180
about it for a long time, and now it seems maybe this one's a slump for a little bit.

478
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:42,780
But we saw the exact same thing with Ubuntu in recent years, kind of some maybe less exciting

479
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:46,860
releases, and it seems maybe they're on an uptrend now for us.

480
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,740
In that context, how do we choose, well I'm gonna make it personal, how do we choose an

481
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:56,260
OS for my dev one, because I need something and I'm finding it really difficult, you know,

482
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:01,620
in the shoes of a listener to just say, well, what does JB recommend as the OS that I should

483
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,020
run for the next year or two?

484
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:06,620
God, it really comes back to like, what problem do you want to solve for?

485
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:12,060
Because in a real way, the problem I was trying to solve with Dylan's laptop was system updates

486
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:17,860
that worked every time and didn't break, and I was sick of fixing a broken app to install,

487
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:21,980
that if you run an Ubuntu install long enough, eventually just doing updates, something breaks

488
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,980
to install, right?

489
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:27,580
It just happens, at least on all of mine it has over time, and it happened on his, and

490
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,580
I was solving for that.

491
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:31,020
So it's like, what problem are you willing to put up with?

492
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:35,300
And then there's this other element that I don't think we talk about, but it matters

493
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,940
a lot, and it's what's the corporate influence?

494
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:44,860
Because a lot of what we're complaining about today is not really because of a technical

495
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,080
issue, it's because of legal issues.

496
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,980
So what is the corporate governance look like, and what do the corporate politics look like?

497
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:54,600
And that's a whole other element you have to consider too, if you really get into it,

498
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,260
and I don't know how you explain that to people, and it's gonna be different at different thresholds

499
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:01,320
and different preferences for each individual.

500
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:07,020
So I think the option is, is distro hop for a while.

501
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:10,440
I think that's why distro hopping is so popular, it's why it's such a meme.

502
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,740
I'm not convinced that solves it, because you could try one version and have a terrible

503
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,500
experience six months later, have a great experience on the very same distro.

504
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,500
I don't know, is that true though?

505
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,740
I mean, I think that's true for people trying it, but I don't know, I think you either have

506
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:27,580
to be willing to accept what you get, or be hands-on in the Linux world.

507
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:31,260
You know, either you can't be that picky, and you gotta just take what the LTS gives

508
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:36,580
you and realize sometimes you're gonna get old, slow stuff, or you're gonna be running

509
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:40,920
something like Fedora or Arch, because you know how to take backups, or know how to roll

510
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,820
back software, or how to deal with the paper cuts that come.

511
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:49,140
I mean, maybe not, but that's usually the way I end up, as an extremely jaded, using

512
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:52,940
Linux for way too long person, is how I end up kind of approaching it.

513
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:56,620
Like either this is a kiosk, or it's somewhere that I fiddle.

514
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,620
Right.

515
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:02,420
It's a tinker toy, or it's an appliance, or another way people like to put it is a pet,

516
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,860
or it's cattle.

517
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:07,740
I think what it is, is when you pick a Linux distro, it's what set of problems do you want

518
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,480
to solve for?

519
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:15,380
And Fedora has, I think, in whole, when you look at all the different distro options,

520
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:19,620
a pretty good understandable set of compromises.

521
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:24,180
NixOS is the one that seems to be kind of hitting my sweet spot right now.

522
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:27,980
Yeah, I was just waiting for that.

523
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:33,460
But there's another set of compromises there, and that is complexity in installing software,

524
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:37,420
and just a new paradigm that you kind of have to wrap your head around.

525
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:40,740
And there's just sometimes an extra step or two.

526
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:44,480
Like I downloaded a piece of software the other day, it was actually the first time

527
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,580
I, this sounds weird, but the first time I ever tried an app image on my NixOS desktop,

528
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,300
I just don't really use app images that much.

529
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,620
No offense, but just don't really use them that much.

530
00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:02,540
And I discovered there's an app image run package in Nix that essentially creates the

531
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:06,260
necessary environment for an app image to run successfully, and then lets you execute

532
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,660
the app image.

533
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:11,300
It meant I don't just download an app image and double click it.

534
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:14,900
And it meant that when I double clicked it, because I was curious what would happen, and

535
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:22,740
nothing happened, like my response can't be, well this damn thing, it has to be, all right,

536
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,580
well let's go Google this, because that's what I'm gonna be doing for a few minutes.

537
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,020
And usually the solution can be found in a few minutes.

538
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,520
And that's a different set of compromises.

539
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:36,200
But those are the ones I'm living with right now.

540
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,420
That's the real, that's the success to Linux.

541
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:45,100
Well, it is nice, I think, at least too, that we can, you know, distro hopping is something

542
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,100
that does work.

543
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,100
Yeah.

544
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,740
So you can have backup, you can dual boot if you like, you know, find one OS that you

545
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:55,060
really like for X activity and want some other LTS setup for, you know, this workflow doesn't

546
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:58,580
change a lot, and I just don't want to ever have to mess with it again.

547
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:03,900
And since so many of our tools, especially with flatbacks and app images and containers,

548
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,900
you can bring them with you.

549
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,820
And you got the choice.

550
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:11,580
And if one distro maker chooses to do something that bugs you, there's several other ones

551
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,780
you can try.

552
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:16,940
There's always Arch.

553
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,540
lino.com slash unplugged.

554
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,460
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

555
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,780
It's a great way to support the show while you're checking out fast and reliable cloud

556
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,780
hosting.

557
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:30,980
The best in the business with real human beings behind the support number and a solid Linux

558
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,420
infrastructure.

559
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:37,420
Over 11 data centers today, right, but they're working on another dozen for next year and

560
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:42,020
a whole new concept for a micro data center, too, which I'm sure we'll talk about at some

561
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,340
point.

562
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:47,180
Everything we've built for the last couple of years, we've built it on Linode, in part

563
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:52,100
because it's great pricing, 30 to 50% cheaper than the hyperscalers out there.

564
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,180
But also the performance is better.

565
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:57,540
It's not just me saying that there's been benchmarks out there, but I've also just tested

566
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,540
it.

567
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:03,420
And it really is just truly great for the price and the performance and the mix of machine

568
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,820
that you can build.

569
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,100
Nobody gets it.

570
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,100
Nobody gets it like Linode.

571
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,020
And you know, they've been at it for like 19 years practically.

572
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,300
So that's kind of why they've really dialed it in.

573
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:19,100
And I bet some of you are thinking about potentially setting up your own presence in the Fediverse,

574
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:23,820
maybe deploying a matrix server or a mastodon server.

575
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:28,140
Linode's got a guide on how to set up mastodon on Linode in a way that's going to work perfect

576
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,140
for you.

577
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:34,460
And what I love about this guide is they actually make it available for one, two, three, four

578
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,460
different distributions.

579
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,620
I'll link to the Ubuntu 2004 one.

580
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,620
I don't know.

581
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:44,820
Personally, for myself, I think that's, I'd probably be considering CentOS Stream.

582
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,980
They have a guide for that as well.

583
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,700
That's what I love about Linode.

584
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,060
They're really distro agnostic.

585
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:52,820
Whichever distro is going to work best for you, they're going to try to work with that.

586
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:55,460
And if you ever get stuck, they got the best support in the business.

587
00:30:55,460 --> 00:31:00,620
It's available 365, seven days a week.

588
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:03,420
I think it's probably the best out there.

589
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:06,460
Nobody else has built that because nobody else had to compete at that level.

590
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:11,580
And when you get that $100 by going to linode.com slash unplugged, you can actually try out the

591
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,060
different features of Linode and see why we love it so much.

592
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:19,540
See why we deploy stuff on there all the time and honestly, the one way you can really,

593
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:24,460
one of the ways, not the one way, but one of the ways you can really tell that we trust

594
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:30,360
Linode is when we do live things like deep fusion image generation or, or SSHing into

595
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:35,320
a box publicly and having everyone on a live stream try to figure out how we broke Docker.

596
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:39,900
We always do those events on Linode hardware because it's the only thing that holds up

597
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,080
to it.

598
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,540
And it just, it's so impressive every single time.

599
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:48,780
So go try it, support the show, build something or learn something.

600
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:52,180
It's a great platform for learning things as well.

601
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:57,020
Linode.com slash unplugged, get the hundred dollars, try it out and support the show.

602
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:03,900
Linode.com slash unplugged.

603
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,220
We got some baller boosts this week to support the show.

604
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:11,660
Wise Papa John came in with our first big boost, 40,000 SATs.

605
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:15,660
Keep the change, you filthy animal.

606
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:21,760
Here's 40,000 for a hard G in GIF.

607
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,220
And also Matrix can be a little intimidating for new users.

608
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:32,020
I feel something that's like more mainstream type social apps, AKA Mastodon, might make

609
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:35,780
the audience interaction a little more approachable for the newbies.

610
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:39,000
It also could be another way to discover old show topics.

611
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,780
I'm thinking a social media post for each new episode with a comments thread and whatnot.

612
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:49,800
Yeah, this Mastodon topic is going to come up again today later in the show.

613
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:55,580
It's a big hot topic right now because as we record this episode, Twitter is a fiasco.

614
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,180
People are trying out Mastodon in numbers.

615
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,460
It's a whole Pandora's Zoo, not just a class.

616
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,460
Yeah.

617
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,860
Pandora's Zoo is a good way to put it.

618
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:06,300
And so I've noticed that the podcasting 2.0 show does this.

619
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,300
They do a Mastodon post as a comments thread section.

620
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,740
Oh yeah, sure.

621
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:16,940
We could probably talk to Alex Gates, the podcasting 2.0 consultant on Office Hours

622
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:24,860
more about this, but there is also work on cross podcasting app comments using Activity

623
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,860
Pub.

624
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,860
I like that.

625
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,860
That sounds like a nice idea.

626
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,860
Yeah.

627
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:32,900
So they could be like part of the Federation, which I think would be really cool.

628
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:38,220
So we'll keep an eye on that development and maybe that kind of stuff could pull us in

629
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:44,860
or maybe I should just start using my Mastodon account on the podcasting 2.0 social thing.

630
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,860
I mean, I could.

631
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,860
I don't know.

632
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:50,020
This has worked so well for me because I can dip in and dip out, but I realize that's the

633
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,540
exact opposite for some people.

634
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:55,300
They don't want something that's moving all the time.

635
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,300
Me I just dip in.

636
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,300
Yeah.

637
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:01,340
Sometimes you feel real chatty or broadcasty and you want to follow up on what's been going

638
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,340
on.

639
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,340
Some days you don't.

640
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,340
But I gets it.

641
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,340
I gets it.

642
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:11,140
And then we got another baller boost from John A. He's back.

643
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:16,740
Twenty five thousand sats and he says, I'm back, baby.

644
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:17,740
Yes, you are, John.

645
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:18,740
It's nice to see you again.

646
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,740
Thank you for the support.

647
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:23,700
I hope you can make it over here before the snow gets too high.

648
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:27,300
It's going to be tricky over those passes soon.

649
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:34,060
I also want to mention that the baller support has really been great for the show in terms

650
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,060
of discovery.

651
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:39,900
We've got new listeners that find us because your boost put us high on the fountain charts

652
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:46,260
and pretty neat is I have a call scheduled with some of the fountain FM leadership on

653
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:51,340
Tuesday next week because they've noticed we're so frequently on the top boosted charts

654
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,900
and they're like, well, we got to talk to Chris more.

655
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,900
That's wonderful.

656
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,260
So I'm going to take some feedback that I've been hearing from the audience and talk with

657
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,260
them about it.

658
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:03,540
But, you know, as a podcaster that does this for a living where my actual livelihood depends

659
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:09,580
on this, having these channels of communications with the app developers are kind of really

660
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,780
important and critical.

661
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:13,580
And so your boost put us up on those charts.

662
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:16,980
We had new audience find us and the developers of Fountain FM.

663
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,100
We got their attention too.

664
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:22,540
And now we're going to have an ongoing dialogue with them thanks to your support and the boosts.

665
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:25,060
I really just I really love how it's working.

666
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,060
I really appreciate it.

667
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,860
So it's like a little audience vouch, you know?

668
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:29,860
Yeah.

669
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,860
Yeah.

670
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,860
Yeah.

671
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,860
It's a real clear signal is what it is.

672
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:37,420
It's better than any algorithm that the platform maker could come up with.

673
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,420
It's better than upvotes.

674
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,420
Yeah, upvotes are cheap.

675
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,420
Yeah.

676
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,420
Yeah.

677
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,420
It's better than a thumbs up or a retweet.

678
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:48,180
It's a real signal because people use their stats and it's a data point of enthusiasm

679
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,420
and people take note.

680
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,700
It's really cool.

681
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,020
And we appreciate it.

682
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,260
The stats are cheap.

683
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,000
They'll probably be cheap for a while.

684
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,820
Don't buy a bunch, but just grab a handful and send them our way with a new podcast app

685
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,820
at newpodcastapps.com.

686
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:10,060
I wanted to follow up on a couple of items and one that just I haven't really seen much

687
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:16,620
discussion and it's kind of been developing I think for about a year and I've been hoping

688
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:23,180
that we'd get some sort of official announcement from Canonical on the state of ZFS in Ubuntu

689
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:28,260
because it seems that they are transitioning away from some of the tooling that they have

690
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:33,560
created to manage ZFS, specifically the ZSYS tooling.

691
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:37,660
And it's even kind of in a deprecated, barely maintained state.

692
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:43,740
There's even potentially some bugs that are impacting data and it doesn't really seem

693
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:48,780
advisable to continue to use ZSYS with ZFS on Ubuntu.

694
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:52,380
I don't know what it means for the long-term ZFS on Ubuntu in general.

695
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,980
Wes, I know you sniffed around a little bit.

696
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,540
Can you kind of summarize what you found?

697
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:03,300
Yeah, it just seems like internally at least at Canonical there's no longer a lot of prioritization

698
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,300
around ZSYS.

699
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:07,340
So it hasn't had any active development.

700
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:11,700
And then people started noticing that there'd been various issues in launchpads suggesting

701
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,380
like, well, we're not working on this.

702
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,920
We're still installing it with the installer.

703
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,580
We should probably update this.

704
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,580
We should clean this up.

705
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:21,420
If we're not going to be maintaining it, then we probably shouldn't be installing it.

706
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:26,460
So it doesn't seem like there's any indication of so far anything changing in terms of shipping

707
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:30,980
the ZFS pre-compiled module, keeping that in sync with the kernels they deliver, all

708
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:34,740
of that good stuff we had since 2016.

709
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:40,340
But in terms of their more ambitious sort of, you know, deeply integrating ZFS with

710
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:46,860
the desktop experience, with the, you know, base underpinnings of the system, not a bright

711
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:49,700
future there, at least at the moment would be my guess.

712
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:54,140
Yeah, it seems that the team has just been reprioritized, right?

713
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:58,220
They're focused on other things and this tooling just isn't a big priority.

714
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:01,560
But it's funny because these things come triumphantly, right?

715
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:05,980
We get this big triumphant introduction of a feature set and it's really cool and we

716
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,980
talk about it.

717
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:11,660
And then sometimes things change and they just quietly fade away.

718
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:16,700
And it seems like no one's really been working on this since, you know, late 2021.

719
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:20,220
And there's just been a couple of wham bam fixes to just kind of cram into the installer.

720
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:25,420
Now, like you say, there's a Launchpad ticket right here to just remove ZSYS from the installer

721
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,420
altogether.

722
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:30,180
That feels like a downgrade to me.

723
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:35,740
And I wonder what your opinion is, is in terms of, well, they should have gone with Butter

724
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:38,460
FS because that was the first thing I thought of.

725
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:43,700
Not just because of the kernel module stuff and the licensing stuff, but to me it felt

726
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:49,620
like if Fedora and Ubuntu were working on tooling together around Butter FS and SUSE's

727
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:54,780
out there working on tooling around Butter FS and we have these three large distro makers

728
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:57,700
that just standardized on Butter FS.

729
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:02,540
Not only would that likely help us improve Butter FS even further, but then if one of

730
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:06,380
them faded, we still have other vendors in the mix.

731
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:14,460
But now what we have is we have Ubuntu with ZFS with tooling that's just kind of being

732
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,460
deprecated.

733
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:21,140
We've got SUSE that's doing their own thing integrated with their own package installer

734
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:24,360
with their own setup on Butter FS, which is probably the most mature.

735
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:30,460
And then we've got Fedora that's moved the ball forward since 33, but not significantly.

736
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:34,740
We're not seeing after you complete a DNF install snapshots that you can then go boot

737
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,900
from grub or anything like that, which it clearly could be if they continue to iterate

738
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:38,900
on it.

739
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:43,340
We've just got three different kind of hodgepodge with open SUSE in the best condition.

740
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:47,980
And I just look at this whole thing and I go, well, you know, when they announced this,

741
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:51,380
my first thought was, boy, it'd be great if they all just went in on Butter FS.

742
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:56,660
And now we're at the end where they're apparently deprecating ZSYS and my thought is, God, it

743
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,500
would have been great if they just would have gone with Butter FS.

744
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:02,540
Yeah, but I mean, does that ever, does it ever work that way, right?

745
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:06,660
ZFS is kind of their sauce, their thing that they know they can bring that other distros

746
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,660
can't or won't.

747
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:12,060
Plus, I mean, we know, not necessarily in a bad way, they've made some very nice tools

748
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:16,700
that I like a lot, but Canonical has a particular way that they build tooling and approach and

749
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,500
tool chains that they want to use, right?

750
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,500
They've got people who know how to use, you know, they seem to use Go a lot for a lot

751
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,980
of these tools, but they've got, you know, particular ways to go about and build these

752
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:24,980
things.

753
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:29,420
To me, it just makes me think it's kind of that ebb and flow we see, you know, at a time,

754
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:32,900
maybe there's a little more interest in some of this like enterprise-y desktop and that

755
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:36,860
space and maybe that's just kind of faded a bit recently.

756
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:42,540
Well, you know how I found out about this is if you ask the folks at the OpenZFS project,

757
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,580
they'll just tell you to just avoid Ubuntu now.

758
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:49,220
And they have on their front page like news about, at least they did this weekend, news

759
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:52,380
about how this is being deprecated and don't use it.

760
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:56,500
It doesn't seem like that's in a good place, that relationship, that doesn't seem like

761
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:01,620
a healthy thing because when you have like the upstream project saying, oh yeah, just

762
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:05,020
don't use Ubuntu, even though they're still shipping the kernel module, that's the...

763
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:07,180
It should be probably one of the better experiences, yeah.

764
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,980
I think it actually is.

765
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:09,980
Yeah.

766
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,540
I don't know, man.

767
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:19,220
We'll have links to the Launchpad issue as well as the issue on the ZSYS project itself

768
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:24,580
where the user ran into a data loss bug, but I want to do another follow-up story.

769
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:28,060
I'd be curious to know what the audience thinks and what their experiences with ZFS there

770
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:33,980
and honestly, if anybody's impacted by the deprecation of the ZSYS tooling, did that

771
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,340
really take off?

772
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,340
Maybe that's an element.

773
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,340
Yeah.

774
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,860
Maybe it just got really low adoption or something.

775
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,260
I don't know if they could measure that.

776
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:45,300
I did see some folks in the various like discourses and stuff wondering like, what are the KPIs

777
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,300
you want to see?

778
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,100
How do we tell you if some people really like this?

779
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,540
I don't know if we have a clear signal on that.

780
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,300
Yeah, that could be part of it too.

781
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:57,020
Well, send us some signal if you have an opinion out there, dear audience.

782
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:02,580
And then I want to go back to the topic of these deep fusion generated images and deep

783
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,340
fake audio.

784
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:12,860
Listener CB had a lot of fun generating some images that are creepy, eerie, close to me.

785
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:18,980
Like the first one in this album that I'll link to in the show notes, I think if I sent

786
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:22,740
that to you, you would think that actually was me writing a penguin.

787
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,740
Totally would.

788
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:26,220
I'm disappointed it wasn't you.

789
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,440
There's me talking to a penguin.

790
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,620
There's also me watching myself on the screen.

791
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:32,620
That also happens.

792
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:33,620
Yeah.

793
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,620
Very, very interesting stuff.

794
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:37,180
But of course, this here is an audio podcast.

795
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:42,580
And Listener CB generated something that is pretty close to the real thing.

796
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:46,200
So are you ready to hear what the current state of deep fake Chris after it's been trained

797
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,200
on our podcast sounds like?

798
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,200
Heck yes.

799
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,200
All right.

800
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,620
Listener Chris decided to create a virtual Chris efficient.

801
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:52,620
So I'm going forward.

802
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,420
I do not need to do these podcasts anymore.

803
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,500
And I can just go on vacation to relax.

804
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,980
Ah, I mean, you kind of understand it, right?

805
00:42:58,980 --> 00:42:59,980
Yeah.

806
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,700
You listen to him for a few seconds.

807
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,940
It starts to make sense.

808
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:06,140
That vacation they may become in their West kind of sounds like a Chris Fisher on his

809
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,380
like third podcast of the day.

810
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,380
Yeah.

811
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:13,460
You know, I thought you're gonna say yeah, drink of the day, you know, that's also the

812
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:14,460
third drink.

813
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,740
I mean, what are you doing to show that?

814
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,180
Come on.

815
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:23,740
And then here CB sent in what he believes is the value for value exchange for this experiment

816
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:24,740
he engaged in.

817
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:29,060
So I need to acknowledge some value that a listener send in over and down.

818
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,620
Listener Chris had prayed something fakes him.

819
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:37,900
And I just want to say that his contribution is worth more than 900,000 boosted sets.

820
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,280
Over 9000.

821
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,220
It's obviously a little rough.

822
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,620
But what about in a year, right?

823
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:45,620
What about even in a year?

824
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:49,220
Isn't that something a little more effort, you know, get some more build a bigger, bigger

825
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:50,220
data set.

826
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:53,100
I'm going to play the first one again.

827
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:57,500
And I think it does actually capture some of my tone.

828
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,300
For this, I had to create a virtual Chris Fisher.

829
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,120
So going forward, I do not need to do these podcasts anymore.

830
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:06,220
And I can just go on vacation to relax.

831
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:08,180
Isn't that remarkable?

832
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,180
That's a lot of fun.

833
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,340
I would let that guy like guide me through a phone tree.

834
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,700
Yeah, you could totally see that.

835
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:13,700
Welcome to you.

836
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:14,700
But I'm wrong.

837
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:15,700
Yeah.

838
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:19,980
Press one like a version where you get Linux action news, but you have to call a hotline.

839
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:23,420
Like like telephone banking, but it's telephone Linux news.

840
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:24,420
Yeah.

841
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,420
Exactly.

842
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:26,420
Member special.

843
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:27,420
Yeah.

844
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:28,420
Yeah.

845
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:29,420
Enter your member code.

846
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:33,980
I'll you guys will have to if you I mean, if you care, you'll have to look at that handsome

847
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:34,980
gentleman.

848
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:38,340
I know some of the images that generated are really something.

849
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:41,520
Me talking to penguins is a theme, which is great.

850
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:46,800
One thing that I do really appreciate about the AI is that it the one thing it really

851
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,420
honed in on is consistent is where I'm overweight.

852
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:55,660
But to the hair, the hair, right, the hair is consistently good.

853
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:58,560
It really it really does that quite well.

854
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,180
Also you could learn a couple of styling tips from AI Chris, I think.

855
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:06,820
I am also I was just going to say I look good in a military uniform like this is the right

856
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:07,820
look for me.

857
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:08,820
Hoodie.

858
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:09,820
Not so great.

859
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,780
Military uniform.

860
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,500
Editor in chief or commander in chief.

861
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,500
Yeah, I guess my I guess my uniform left.

862
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,740
I've been lurking on building a personal uniform.

863
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:22,500
I'm going to have to just go for like the you know, like the actual like military style,

864
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,500
you know, because that looks good.

865
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,500
It looks good.

866
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:28,380
Yeah, I feel like I want to set up another one of these deep fusion instances.

867
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:29,380
Oh, yeah.

868
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:30,380
We're not.

869
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:31,380
We're not.

870
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:32,380
It's too much fun.

871
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:33,380
It was a lot of fun.

872
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:34,900
It was a lot of fun for screwing around.

873
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:38,620
We use it for just low key stuff like over at Jupiter dot tube.

874
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:43,340
All of the you know, instead of doing like silly YouTube thumbnails, we just generate

875
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,340
a silly AI image.

876
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:46,340
Why not?

877
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:50,580
It's been working pretty good.

878
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:54,620
Bitwarden dot com slash Linux go there right now to get started with a free trial for a

879
00:45:54,620 --> 00:46:00,180
team or an enterprise or try it as an individual by going to Bitwarden dot com slash Linux.

880
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:05,340
I haven't mentioned this before, but enterprise plans include complementary family plans.

881
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:09,740
So that's a great way to extend security not only to your entire organization, but also

882
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:12,820
to your team members, your coworkers at home.

883
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:16,100
So if you haven't advocated for Bitwarden at your organization yet, that might be a

884
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:19,300
great direction to go and send them to Bitwarden dot com slash Linux.

885
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:22,980
It's the easiest way to store, share and sync your sensitive data.

886
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,260
And Bitwarden is open source.

887
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:26,100
It's trusted by millions of us in the community.

888
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,300
It's what Wes and I use all the time.

889
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:32,340
I'm using it now for my two factor codes as well, which makes that so much more reliable

890
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,780
for me, especially the way I move machines.

891
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:38,620
You can use it for other sensitive data, too, like account recovery keys or other types

892
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:43,820
of secrets that either want to store in one secure central place that you can trust or

893
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:47,400
also something maybe like a secret you might need to share with a team member or a friend

894
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,380
or a family member at some point or a spouse.

895
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:56,440
Bitwarden is fantastic for that while not messing up your whole OPSEC, as they say.

896
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:01,060
And the mobile clients have made it really feasible to have secure passwords, unique

897
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:07,660
user names and unique email addresses for every site, service or even app you use, which

898
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:13,340
is fantastic since I'm moving between my desktop and my mobile devices all the time.

899
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:17,140
And Bitwarden is rolling out features every single month, including they just recently

900
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:22,940
rolled out DuckDuckGo email aliasing, support for fast mails, email alias, password protected

901
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,700
encrypted exports.

902
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:27,020
I love to see them working more with DuckDuckGo, too.

903
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:29,620
I think that's a real positive sign.

904
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:34,500
So go try it out for free right now by going to bitwarden.com slash Linux.

905
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:39,460
You sign up there or if you've already taken care of this, and I hope you have because

906
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:44,900
a password manager and something like Bitwarden that can help you store your secrets and all

907
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:50,420
your sensitive data very securely that you can trust, that's just an absolute critical

908
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:52,400
tool for staying safe and secure online.

909
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,460
So I hope you already know about this.

910
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:57,540
You probably do, but I bet you have a friend or a family member.

911
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:58,540
Maybe it's Brent.

912
00:47:58,540 --> 00:47:59,540
Maybe it's somewhere you work.

913
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:00,580
I don't know.

914
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:01,580
Maybe they need a little convincing.

915
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:05,500
So have them go try it, bitwarden.com slash Linux.

916
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,500
It's good for you.

917
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:07,500
It's good for the internet.

918
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:14,740
It's true, too, bitwarden.com slash Linux.

919
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:18,540
As always, we got some great feedback this week, but we do have a special little something

920
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:20,020
from listener Jeff.

921
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:23,580
Let's just call it a geocache update for the Folsom location.

922
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:27,300
Captain, I am on location at the Sacramento geocache.

923
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,300
It is missing.

924
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:29,700
I repeat, missing.

925
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,160
Abort the search.

926
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,580
It is no longer here.

927
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:34,300
It has been found.

928
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:35,300
Data conclusive.

929
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:39,100
Thank you, Jeff.

930
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:43,940
So of course, for those of you who just need to be caught up is Chris was right all along.

931
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:49,460
Folsom was one of our first successful, maybe the second successful geocache that was found

932
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,720
by an audience member.

933
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,380
That's clearly what happened.

934
00:48:52,380 --> 00:49:00,580
And Jeff went on location to verify and he confirmed via visual data that the Folsom

935
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:05,460
Linux Unplugged cache has been discovered, like I knew all along.

936
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:06,460
Like I knew all along.

937
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:10,260
But there was kind of another kind of funny coincidence while he was there, Brent.

938
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:14,980
Yeah, he ran into listener Jared again and his family, and that's the second time that

939
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:18,620
happens at that particular location, which I think is super fun.

940
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,060
That is so great.

941
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:25,780
Jeff mentioned that listener Jared's daughter, I think, or son ran up one of the kids.

942
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:28,260
Are you looking for the JB geocache?

943
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:31,100
That's adorable.

944
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:32,940
Second time that happens.

945
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:33,940
So good.

946
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:36,740
I mean, if you're going to meet strangers in the woods, I would hope they're fans.

947
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,260
I think we got to do more of these.

948
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:41,060
We should have given Jeff a geocache.

949
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,060
We need it.

950
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:47,660
You know, oh, oh, what we need are geocache bundles that we can mail out to listeners

951
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:49,460
that they could stash in their general area.

952
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:50,460
Now you're talking.

953
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:51,460
That's what we need to do.

954
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:54,740
I bet the listeners will be way better at hiding geocaches than we are.

955
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:55,740
Yeah.

956
00:49:55,740 --> 00:50:00,460
So what we could do is we could have somebody email into the show and let us know if you

957
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:01,460
want to do this.

958
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:02,460
See if anybody's interested.

959
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:05,500
And what we could do is we'd basically send you a little Tupperware container full of

960
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:11,820
swag that you hide in your area, then you've got to send us video of you like kind of in

961
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:12,820
the area hiding it.

962
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:14,260
But we don't want to give away the location exactly.

963
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:17,060
So you just give us a little narration of where it's at.

964
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:19,140
You know, this is what you'd have to do if you want to participate in it.

965
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:21,620
So that way we can play the clip to give people a hint.

966
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:23,180
Got to craft your clue.

967
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:26,700
You got to craft a clue and then let us know.

968
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:27,700
And we could send a few of these out.

969
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:28,700
I think.

970
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,380
Oh, it's great to know I was right about the Folsom cache.

971
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:32,380
That's good.

972
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:33,380
That's good.

973
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:35,580
We got some mail this week.

974
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:41,140
Benjamin wrote in about Jupiter.tube and I think he's looking for some peers.

975
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:46,340
He writes, for me over here in the UK, I rarely see more than two peers, usually one and I

976
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:52,620
get about 15k down if I'm lucky during live streams.

977
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:58,500
So it's usually a two seconds of video playback, a minute or so of buffering and just repeat

978
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,500
that cycle.

979
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:04,740
None of the other RTMP, RTSP or radio streams seem to work for me either.

980
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:08,060
So I rely on the YouTube streams for the most part.

981
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:12,020
I can, however, watch the published stream the next day without any problems from Jupiter

982
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:13,020
Tube.

983
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:14,500
So just not when it's live.

984
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,740
Well, now that is interesting.

985
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:17,740
Yeah.

986
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:18,740
Strange.

987
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:19,740
Now that's a curveball.

988
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:21,740
You're able to pull data from that server.

989
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:24,100
How does that make any sense?

990
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:27,260
Because when it's live, it's doing a web torrent from that server anyways.

991
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:32,380
So it's still coming from the server if there's no peers.

992
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:33,380
So how does that make any sense?

993
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:34,380
Yeah.

994
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:37,780
And it should just grab that HLS files at the end of the day, right?

995
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:38,780
Yeah.

996
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:41,860
This feels to me like one of those pieces of mail that gets us trying to figure out

997
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:46,820
a problem that we didn't know existed because we've had listeners, especially in the mumble

998
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:50,980
room, who have used Jupiter Tube while we're live for the most part.

999
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:54,580
And it's not, you know, we've had to add a peer or two, but it's for the most part, I

1000
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:55,580
think working.

1001
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:56,580
Yeah.

1002
00:51:56,580 --> 00:52:00,900
So it would be nice to have more people kind of taking us up on the Jupiter Tube peering

1003
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:01,900
stuff.

1004
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:06,820
I understand it's tricky because in some circumstances, YouTube or Twitch just works better or it's

1005
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:08,580
what you have an app for or whatever.

1006
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:15,500
But you know, these self-hosted open source platforms are only as successful as the user

1007
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:16,500
base for them.

1008
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,720
And it's like if anybody's going to use them, it's probably going to be us.

1009
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:23,100
So we should try to actually be there to be customers for these things and demonstrate

1010
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,460
a demand.

1011
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:26,020
And we could use more people peering.

1012
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:29,700
But the other thing that I think is doable, and maybe somebody out there knows the way,

1013
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:36,140
we've gotten close, is a way to essentially set up our own peers, like maybe a headless

1014
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:41,140
Linode that we deploy somewhere in the world that's just adding a peer over there.

1015
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:45,180
And it's not just as simple as a web torrent.

1016
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:52,100
It is also, so a peer tube, it uses torrents to distribute the HLS files and it uses WebRTC

1017
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:55,000
to communicate something in some data channel.

1018
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,820
So you have to have a WebRTC communications channel as well.

1019
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:06,620
And there is an Electron app there that does seeding and does the WebRTC stuff.

1020
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:09,060
You can't run that headless.

1021
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,060
Maybe we can.

1022
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:13,820
Anyways, if people out there have tips for us or want to just participate...

1023
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:17,140
But we need to update it with each new live stream too, huh?

1024
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:23,340
Jupyter.tube though, that's our per tube instance where we video stream the recording of our

1025
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:27,500
shows and then we archive them over there for playback if people would like.

1026
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:33,200
Noah also wrote in with a potential Odroid killer, he says, what do you guys think of

1027
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,720
this particular single board computer?

1028
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:41,860
As Intel NICs, six serial ATA ports, doesn't quite have RAID support, but might just be

1029
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:43,980
an option for JB.

1030
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:51,180
The N5105 or the N6005 NAS board, it does look really good.

1031
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:56,740
You know what is nice is it's Intel NICs and way more SATA.

1032
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:57,740
Six?

1033
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:58,740
Yeah.

1034
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:00,380
That's pretty sweet.

1035
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:06,200
So the base price is $195 US greenbacks, then it looks like it goes up to about $480 depending

1036
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,820
on when you buy it and what you spec it with.

1037
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:13,540
Yeah, you can either get a Celeron N5105 or Pentium N6005.

1038
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:15,500
It's got NVMe.

1039
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:16,500
That looks good.

1040
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,500
DDR4.

1041
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:18,500
That looks good.

1042
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:19,500
Lots of SATA.

1043
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,300
It's got dual M.2s, looks like.

1044
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,580
Man, how many USB ports does this freaking thing have too or whatever?

1045
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:26,620
There's just a ton of ports on this thing.

1046
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:29,460
Yeah, this looks really nice.

1047
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:33,380
This is always the problem, is there's always so many options and this came up with the

1048
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:34,380
Raspberry Pi too.

1049
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:38,080
As soon as you mentioned you got a Raspberry Pi, there's like, oh, have you tried this?

1050
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:41,660
And sometimes it's like there are better ones and this could be a better one.

1051
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:45,500
And then sometimes you want to get behind the one that has a bit of an ecosystem.

1052
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:48,320
Do you have opt case option, what's the form factor?

1053
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,500
What do you know about the manufacturer, are they going to stick around?

1054
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,500
Yeah.

1055
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,500
Yeah.

1056
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,500
Ugh.

1057
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,500
It's hard.

1058
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,500
This is a hard choice to make.

1059
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,420
And we're not even done yet because we want to replace a couple machines here in the studio

1060
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:00,420
too.

1061
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:01,420
We don't want big computers.

1062
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:03,420
I think we've got to crowdsource it, right?

1063
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:07,020
People just got to start buying these things and let us know.

1064
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:08,020
Yeah.

1065
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:09,020
Yeah.

1066
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:12,140
We just have people buy a whole bunch of different ones and we can all run the Ferronics test

1067
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:14,780
suite on them, get a big comparison suite going.

1068
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:19,660
Well, I think to add one more to the pile, Matthew also wrote in just about at the same

1069
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:23,780
time and suggested a Nexcom mini PC.

1070
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:28,740
He writes, Chris has been talking about that Odroid on Linux Unplugged and Cellposi quite

1071
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:32,020
a bit, and I wanted to suggest the Nexcom devices.

1072
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:36,860
They're an industrial, mostly fanless x86 platform for a variety of applications.

1073
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:41,260
In particular, I use the Nexcom NDIS device.

1074
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:45,700
It's meant to be a signage player, but I use the device as a fanless application server

1075
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:48,900
running Ubuntu server, and I love the thing.

1076
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:54,820
Mine is an i5 base PC and it's gone as far as testing 4k Plex trans codes and it handles

1077
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:58,340
a couple of the trans codes at the same time without issue.

1078
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:00,220
Praise QuickSync.

1079
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:02,700
The device can be had on eBay relatively cheaply.

1080
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:04,260
You should give them a gander.

1081
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,260
All right.

1082
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:06,260
Jeez.

1083
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:07,260
Yeah.

1084
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:09,880
This is the way if you ever want to find out what's really great out there, you buy something,

1085
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:12,700
get really hyped about it, and then you'll discover all the other options.

1086
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:14,180
But some of these are really cool.

1087
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:18,500
I dig the built-in heatsink and the mounts and the DC power.

1088
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,260
Oh, man, that's checking a box.

1089
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:23,340
We could just screw that onto the back of you.

1090
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:25,540
I feel like we almost need a tiny PC library.

1091
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:29,740
You can just check one out for a week or two, give it a try.

1092
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:33,820
I am really enjoying the small, low-power PC.

1093
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:35,700
It's one thing to just get a crazy fast...

1094
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:36,700
I mean, that's great.

1095
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:40,260
I absolutely love that too, but there's just something about these that are just enough

1096
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:41,540
machine.

1097
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:45,620
Just enough machine, not drawing too much power, which is another big thing for me.

1098
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:48,740
I feel like there's a big future in playing around with that kind of hardware and seeing

1099
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:50,180
how much Linux you can get.

1100
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:54,980
You're just going to try to fill all of your places with as many tiny little PCs now, aren't

1101
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:55,980
you?

1102
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:56,980
Yeah, man.

1103
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:57,980
Yeah.

1104
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:01,600
I mean, why have big computers when you can have lots of small, little computers?

1105
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,600
That's my thinking there, right?

1106
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:03,600
Swarm, swarm.

1107
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:04,600
Booster Graham.

1108
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:05,600
All right.

1109
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:10,300
We got some big old boosts into the show this week that we want to cover.

1110
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:15,260
And then I kind of also want to talk about, just as an aside, this whole FTX situation.

1111
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:22,460
If you're curious what's going on there, why this whole Bitcoin casino crashed around them,

1112
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:26,140
we just published an episode of the Bitcoin Dad Pod.

1113
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:33,320
And you can find that at bitcoindadpod.fireside.fm and it's slash episode 50, so slash 50.

1114
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,060
Effective scam tourism.

1115
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:36,900
And we break it all down in plain English.

1116
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,500
What's going on there?

1117
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:42,660
Why the price of Bitcoin goes down with it, which is essentially people have to sell to

1118
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:43,660
cover their positions.

1119
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:51,940
It turns out that FTX was sitting on two Bitcoin, so they didn't have a lot of Bitcoin.

1120
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:55,060
They were mostly dealing around with these scam coins.

1121
00:57:55,060 --> 00:58:00,140
But if you have questions or you'd just like to know a recap that's just a common sense

1122
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:04,900
recap, go check it out in episode 50 of the Bitcoin Dad Pod.

1123
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:09,620
And then we get to, I think it's going to be Mentat, I think, I don't know if I have

1124
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:12,460
that right, but we're going to go with the Mentat.

1125
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:18,700
And Mentat sends in a row of ducks, 2222.

1126
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:22,600
Since you guys started talking about the shift in podcast advertising, I have noticed several

1127
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:28,300
podcasts and podcast networks I listened to doubling or even tripling up on ads, as well

1128
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:31,540
as starting up membership subscriptions at the same time.

1129
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:33,420
Man, that's rough.

1130
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:35,860
I hope that this goes smoothly.

1131
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:42,420
I've been following the financial news of some of the big podcast sponsors in this space

1132
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:47,300
and they are having a rough time of it, the tech sector in general.

1133
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:51,540
So I think it is, if there's a podcast out there that you really like and you've been

1134
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:55,420
considering joining the membership, it might be time to consider because I think some of

1135
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:58,420
these podcasters are probably panicking.

1136
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:02,540
If I were trying to get a membership program launched right now, I would be in like, you

1137
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:04,020
know, disaster mode.

1138
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:05,460
It'd be really scary.

1139
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:10,020
I'm so grateful for our members because they really, it's like, that's how we know our

1140
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:13,700
ongoing production is covered.

1141
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:17,060
We may have to make big changes, but like the shows will continue.

1142
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:20,220
And that's, you know, the members are like the insurance program for that.

1143
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:23,820
And I'm very, very grateful, especially now.

1144
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:28,580
Marcel boosts in with some enterprise at 1701.

1145
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:32,820
As a one-off during a busy week, I think I actually would listen to a fully AI generated

1146
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:33,820
show.

1147
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,620
I think it'd actually be pretty good, but I don't think I'd want it every week.

1148
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:39,700
Well, that'll be if you can tell.

1149
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:41,500
That would be the benchmark, I think.

1150
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:45,580
I think an AI generated show would only make sense for like a holiday show where you're

1151
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:50,580
trying to do essentially like a best of, but from new content generated from the old content.

1152
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:55,520
And you'd have to have like editorial control and it would take so much more work than just

1153
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,520
doing a show.

1154
00:59:56,520 --> 01:00:00,460
Would we be able to generate the whole thing where we have to like sort of edit together

1155
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:02,100
some of the stuff that did pop out?

1156
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:03,660
Would this part be generated?

1157
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:05,180
How do you have that?

1158
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:07,940
How does the AI know how to give Chris enough sass?

1159
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:08,940
That's finally tuned.

1160
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:09,940
Yeah.

1161
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:10,940
Yeah.

1162
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:11,940
You really got to figure it out.

1163
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:15,180
So, well, it's going to be a couple of years at least.

1164
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:19,980
And then Rusticastroversa came in with a row of ducks.

1165
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:23,140
And just simply says, boost!

1166
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:24,140
B-O-O-S-T.

1167
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:30,380
412 Linux boosts in with 2,048 sets.

1168
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:38,060
Regarding packaging on distributions, Ubuntu MATE enabled Flatpak along with Snaps in 2204.

1169
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:40,860
This has been a fantastic experience for me.

1170
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:44,980
Initially, I found it beneficial to quickly switch Firefox from Snap to Flatpak.

1171
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:50,340
Now I can use whatever packaging system works best for the application I am installing.

1172
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:52,580
The Ubuntu MATE team have made this easy.

1173
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:55,420
It's a really underappreciated feature.

1174
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:56,420
That is nice.

1175
01:00:56,420 --> 01:01:01,940
Flatpaks on an Ubuntu system out of the box, that's just giving your users what they need

1176
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:02,940
and want.

1177
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:03,940
You got to respect that.

1178
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:04,940
Yeah.

1179
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:07,140
And then I think to 412's point too, it's like, well, maybe, you know, if you're already

1180
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:10,100
sold on some Snaps, maybe you're doing the next Cloud Snap, whatever, like, you know,

1181
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:14,660
you've got best of all them worlds.

1182
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:18,900
The facial hair boosts in with 6,000 cents.

1183
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:19,900
Boost!

1184
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:23,820
I recall Chris mentioned he got his hands on a popcorn pocket PC.

1185
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:27,420
I was wondering, what ever happened to it?

1186
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:31,980
Well, we have it in-house and I kind of fire it up from time to time.

1187
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:34,940
I dust off and I play around and see how things are.

1188
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:39,700
This is one of those things that's tricky to talk about on air because it's got a lot

1189
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:42,660
of promise, but it isn't quite there yet.

1190
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:46,260
There's not a firmware that is really, like, I could just say, hey, go grab this and throw

1191
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:47,260
this firmware.

1192
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:48,260
Right.

1193
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:56,340
And I don't want to come on air and talk negatively about it and sort of undercut any progress.

1194
01:01:56,340 --> 01:02:00,060
But at the same time, there's nothing really to say that's positive yet.

1195
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:03,100
So I'm kind of in a waiting phase and I have been for a long time.

1196
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:06,100
Hasn't found its way actually, like, into your life in a meaningful way yet.

1197
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:07,100
Yeah.

1198
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:12,900
So if you're not familiar with the popcorn computer, it's about the size of a Game Boy,

1199
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:18,620
a little a little wider and it's got a full QWERTY keyboard, LCD screen, some USB-C ports

1200
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:23,340
and yeah, it's supposed to run Linux and you grab a, you know, you grab a video out port

1201
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:26,780
and you could hook it up and now you got a full computer and you disconnect it and you're

1202
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:32,280
just walking around with a little tiny five inch screen kind of a thing.

1203
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:36,840
But so far, so far, I have not really found the firmware that really brings it home.

1204
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:37,980
But I'm keeping an eye out there.

1205
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:42,220
So if anybody out there wants an update or you hear something, maybe I missed it, shoot

1206
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:45,940
me a shoot me a boost or shoot me an email or something, let me know and I'll I'll give

1207
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:47,380
it a go again.

1208
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:51,540
Now we got quite a bit of feedback about Mastodon, we got a bunch of boosts in and we also got

1209
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:57,340
a bunch of plus ones via, you know, the old email, Tekov 751 specifically boosted it in

1210
01:02:57,340 --> 01:03:01,580
with a mini row of ducks, 222 sats.

1211
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:07,420
I tried to build out a smaller Mastodon server for a small community of 50 or so people.

1212
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:09,880
Later though, I had to kill it in the beta trial.

1213
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:14,820
It was obvious that even if it was really to put hours and automation into place, it

1214
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:17,060
was just going to be too much.

1215
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:20,220
The instance needs a load of resources, mostly for storage.

1216
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:26,020
And the bigger issue is that massive moderation is required, at least a couple of people with

1217
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:28,260
good moral compass to make it happen.

1218
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:32,560
Yeah, there's, there's that whole element of having to manage that whenever you run

1219
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:33,560
a community thing.

1220
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:39,420
But I, I was wondering about what it is to run a Mastodon instance on the backend because

1221
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:45,580
my experience with matrix is that the federation aspect actually is quite a bit of traffic.

1222
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:52,980
And if you're, if you're following people across multiple instances, your home server

1223
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:57,680
has to be pulling all of that in and subscribing to that on activity pub, I would imagine.

1224
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:03,380
And so if you have hundreds or thousands of users that are doing that across multiple

1225
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:08,140
servers, the backend has got to be managing all of that.

1226
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:09,740
It's got to be quite the load.

1227
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:11,220
Actually I would think to run a Mastodon server.

1228
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:12,380
Maybe I'm wrong.

1229
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:17,300
Maybe it's simpler than I'm picturing because I'm basing my experience on matrix, which

1230
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:22,500
it, this is, this is a pretty big amount of data with matrix, but I, uh, I'd love any

1231
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:25,180
insight people have from running a Mastodon instance.

1232
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:32,980
Not that I'm thinking about doing it or Cinemotev also boosted in with 2048 sats, another plug

1233
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:33,980
for Mastodon.

1234
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:40,100
I never use the JB matrix due to chat and being, having to be there live.

1235
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:45,220
I hang out one to two times a week and when I do, I just never know what's going on.

1236
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:46,220
That's fair.

1237
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:50,740
I hear, I hear a call for that in that same vein for a, you know, a discourse or something.

1238
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:52,340
A place for offline chatting.

1239
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:53,340
Yeah.

1240
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:54,340
Yeah.

1241
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:58,660
We also got a thousand sats from OP 1984, just a plus one for Mastodon.

1242
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:02,540
Uh, just moved to Pontiacindex.social and already follow Chris there.

1243
01:05:02,540 --> 01:05:04,620
Hey Chris, you have followers already.

1244
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:05,620
That's nice.

1245
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:06,620
How about that?

1246
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:07,620
Oh gosh.

1247
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:11,180
Where he talks about that podcasting 2.0 nonsense.

1248
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:17,480
And another 128 sats from Paul Asteluk who says, can JB set up a social network that

1249
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,900
keeps me social?

1250
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:23,220
So far you're, so far you're batting a thousand with your recommendations.

1251
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:27,020
I'm still on matrix admittedly only in JB general chat.

1252
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:28,020
Great show as always.

1253
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:29,020
Thank you.

1254
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:33,420
He also tosses a few sats for, uh, well, Chris, how am I supposed to read this?

1255
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:34,420
I don't know.

1256
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:35,420
Jif.

1257
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:41,220
Yeah, but isn't that supposed to be a vote for how to, it's supposed to be a vote for

1258
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:43,300
how to say it, but it just is written.

1259
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:47,740
So I don't know how anybody's, how is, you know, I don't know how anybody's supposed

1260
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:48,740
to know.

1261
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:49,740
Cause when you're reading it, it's hard to tell.

1262
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:52,900
This is part of the problem with the whole, the whole Jif gift thing.

1263
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:55,980
Maybe this is a meta vote for a better name.

1264
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:58,400
I mean, I don't know how anybody's going to beat Wise Papa John.

1265
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:05,460
He put 40,000 sats behind a hard G. So somebody's, I mean, until somebody surpasses that, then

1266
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:07,660
officially on the show, it has a hard G and that's how it is.

1267
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:08,660
Yeah.

1268
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:09,660
Boost decided, I guess.

1269
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:10,660
Awesome.

1270
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:18,140
Matt wrote in with 69, 69 sats as a boost, I haven't really used Macedon, but I've used

1271
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:19,140
Pleroma.

1272
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:21,140
Have you guys used Pleroma?

1273
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:23,540
I haven't even heard of it actually.

1274
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:24,540
Heard of it?

1275
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:26,660
A lightweight Fediverse server.

1276
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:27,660
Never used it.

1277
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:32,940
I've actually kind of heard disparaging things about it, but whenever a technology gets cast

1278
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:36,060
in one way or another, I always think, well, is it the technology or is it the people or

1279
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:38,180
is it just marketing?

1280
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:41,660
But it looks like a leaner, lighter Mastodon essentially.

1281
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:47,420
Let's you participate in the Fediverse, but just as a little cleaner, maybe, maybe simpler

1282
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,060
to implement on the back end as well.

1283
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:51,300
Maybe a little more suited for a smaller group.

1284
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:56,540
Tire boosts in with 2,023 sats, a little future boost.

1285
01:06:56,540 --> 01:07:01,780
I predict that JB will start its own Mastodon server in 2023.

1286
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:02,780
I'm calling it.

1287
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:04,140
I know how Chris thinks.

1288
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:05,780
The seed has been planted.

1289
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:09,020
Hey, that's our first 2023 boost.

1290
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:10,020
Nice.

1291
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:11,020
Nice.

1292
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:12,020
All right.

1293
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:13,020
Future prediction there.

1294
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:15,980
So a Mastodon instance in 2023.

1295
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:34,660
Viridian boosts in with another 1,701 Satoshis.

1296
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:36,380
I assume it's in reference to Viridian 3.

1297
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:39,100
I mean, it must be, right?

1298
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:44,060
Your discussion about signal was poignant, as I've been eyeing alternatives.

1299
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:49,940
The lack of support for CarPlay, backups, and HTTP proxies, along with the devs' attitude,

1300
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:51,980
make it abrasive.

1301
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:57,100
WhatsApp solves all of these issues, but meta.

1302
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:59,780
I hadn't considered switching the family to Matrix.

1303
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:03,740
Intriguing, but as far as I know, no clients support CarPlay.

1304
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:07,980
I'm also concerned about not being able to move accounts between home servers.

1305
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:08,980
Any suggestions?

1306
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:13,220
Otherwise, I'll just keep waiting for the one chat app.

1307
01:08:13,220 --> 01:08:14,220
For the one.

1308
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:16,220
I've been giving more thought to the Matrix one.

1309
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:21,940
I've been really kind of considering if I were to move the whole family to another chat

1310
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:25,260
platform.

1311
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:30,300
My first thought actually was, maybe I'll just stand up an XMPP server.

1312
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:34,040
And that feels like a great idea until you think, yeah, but all the clients, they're

1313
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:36,300
not really as featureful now.

1314
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:40,860
And then that's a real challenge because I think your family now expects stickers and

1315
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:44,980
emoji reactions and all that stuff.

1316
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:50,220
And while Matrix doesn't have all of the things that those apps do, it adds more stuff that

1317
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:52,180
people expect in a feature set.

1318
01:08:52,180 --> 01:08:57,020
So I think that's another plus one for moving this family to a private Matrix instance.

1319
01:08:57,020 --> 01:09:01,740
I think the question just becomes, which app?

1320
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:02,740
Which front end?

1321
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:06,100
And that might take a little experimentation.

1322
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:09,700
Dreams Void boosts in the row of duck.

1323
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:13,660
I'm a duck, D-U-K, duck, loaded with talent.

1324
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:14,660
Something profound.

1325
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:18,500
I'm finally caught up with luck now.

1326
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:25,100
On to Office Hours episode 9, South Posted episode 81, and LAN episode 259.

1327
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:26,100
That's nice.

1328
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:27,100
Nice.

1329
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:28,100
I wondered, were you on a road trip?

1330
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:29,100
Yeah.

1331
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:30,100
Did you go through a tear?

1332
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:31,100
What happened?

1333
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:32,100
What happened?

1334
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:33,100
Got all caught up.

1335
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:34,100
Been out for a while?

1336
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:35,100
It's nice.

1337
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:36,100
Welcome.

1338
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:37,100
Couldn't sleep at night.

1339
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:38,100
Nice to have you here.

1340
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:39,100
Whatever the reason, keep it up.

1341
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:44,260
We're just in with 3,141 sats.

1342
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:48,540
Well as the influencer that inspired me to buy my own Raspberry Pi, I'm saddened to hear

1343
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:49,540
you've moved on.

1344
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:52,860
I'm also saddened that I now have a new toy that I desire.

1345
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:54,940
Yeah, we're all feeling that.

1346
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:55,940
Don't worry.

1347
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:56,940
Feel free to ship me all your unused pies.

1348
01:09:56,940 --> 01:10:01,860
I'll throw them in my Micro K8s cluster.

1349
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:05,020
You know, I wonder, I'm not really, I guess I actually do have a couple that are not currently

1350
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:08,380
in use, but I don't imagine I'll stop using the Raspberry Pis.

1351
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:12,780
I just don't know if I'm going to buy any more Pi 4s, although I did hear some rumors

1352
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:16,660
that there's some new Pi hardware we're going to get teased with.

1353
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:23,380
You know, for me, if they didn't have a huge increase in CPU performance on the Pi, if

1354
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:27,220
they just had a moderate CPU increase and a moderate memory increase, but had a big

1355
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:33,620
increase on storage in terms of IO, not size, I think that would put the Pi in contender

1356
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:34,620
category again.

1357
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:36,860
I mean, it's nice being on x86 again.

1358
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:39,460
There is that whole element as well.

1359
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:40,460
But we'll see.

1360
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:41,460
We'll see.

1361
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:42,580
Maybe we'll get a tease.

1362
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:46,060
Soham boosted in live last week with a row of ducks.

1363
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:47,060
Thank you kindly.

1364
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:48,060
And it was a live boost.

1365
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:49,060
So that's pretty neat.

1366
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:52,580
But what is even more rad about it is he used Boost CLI.

1367
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:54,900
You delightful nerd.

1368
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:56,260
That's pretty awesome.

1369
01:10:56,260 --> 01:10:59,180
And he says Nix is the greatest package manager ever created.

1370
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:00,180
That may be true.

1371
01:11:00,180 --> 01:11:02,180
We will have to have someone confirm that.

1372
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:03,340
We'll put somebody on that.

1373
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:04,700
Truly there's research going on.

1374
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:10,900
And then our last boost this week came in from JPC, who sent us a row of Grandpa Ducks

1375
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:13,580
22,222 SATs.

1376
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:15,260
This old duck still got it.

1377
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:17,940
He says he loves the show and he's also using Boost CLI.

1378
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,940
Well, well done JPC.

1379
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:21,800
Thank you everyone for the support.

1380
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:23,060
We really appreciate it.

1381
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:24,060
We still love the SATs.

1382
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:25,540
SATs are SATs to us.

1383
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:29,340
So grab a handful on the cheap using something like Strike or the Cash App.

1384
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:32,740
If you're outside the US, Blue Wallet.

1385
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:35,700
I really like RoboSats too if you want to get really geeky, but then you got to have

1386
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:36,700
Tor Browser.

1387
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:41,220
I'm imagining if we had like a fancy like downtown SF, JB office or whatever, we could

1388
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:44,100
have like a little Boost CLI terminal set up and ready to go.

1389
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:46,140
It's got like retro term on there, right?

1390
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:50,100
Like you're just, oh man, try your first boost.

1391
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:51,980
Retro term or just a really old CRT.

1392
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:52,980
Yeah.

1393
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:56,820
Could go, you know, go clacky IBM PS2 keyboard as well.

1394
01:11:56,820 --> 01:11:58,500
Someday with enough boosts we'll get there.

1395
01:11:58,500 --> 01:11:59,780
That would be pretty neat.

1396
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:00,780
That would be.

1397
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:01,780
Yes.

1398
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:04,220
We got some boost into the show, newpodcastapps.com.

1399
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:07,140
That's where you go to upgrade to a podcasting 2.0 app.

1400
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:10,900
We got more in the works there too, as far as podcasting 2.0 features.

1401
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:15,300
So go check out Office Hours 16, where we talk about some of that stuff we'll be working

1402
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:16,300
on.

1403
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:18,700
Also just a random shout out because we got some boost in that we don't make it on the

1404
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:22,340
show, but we still just wanted to pick a handful to say thank you and thank you everybody else

1405
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:26,500
if we didn't call out your name or read your message, we still got it and we really appreciate

1406
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:27,980
your support.

1407
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:30,140
I wanted to do this one because let's see if I got this right.

1408
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:32,900
Let me know if I got your name right.

1409
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:40,540
One thousand sats from Firghazballs, something like that.

1410
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:43,660
Is this deep fake, Chris?

1411
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:49,100
We got a hundred sats from TheBooch asking about our thoughts on signal adding stories,

1412
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:52,300
which is actually Office Hours as well as that.

1413
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:54,940
So go check out Office Hours 16 for that, TheBooch.

1414
01:12:54,940 --> 01:13:00,340
And then Oppie1984 says that it's GIF, GIF is peanut butter.

1415
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:02,940
Well you're gonna have to send in more than a hundred and sats, buddy.

1416
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:06,380
And then NachoLinux sent a row of sticks.

1417
01:13:06,380 --> 01:13:10,380
He says I cranked through my Fountain FM subscriptions to earn some sats so I could boost in.

1418
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:11,620
Oh, thank you.

1419
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:12,620
That's very awesome.

1420
01:13:12,620 --> 01:13:14,420
Thank you everybody.

1421
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:17,060
And we appreciate the members out there too who support the show.

1422
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:21,540
They invest in our ongoing production, UnpluggedCore.com if you want to become a member of this show

1423
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:23,620
or Jupiter.party if you want all the shows.

1424
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:25,940
And as a thank you, we give it to you ad-free.

1425
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:29,020
And we also package up the live stream and we make it available to you.

1426
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:31,180
We put lots of extra content in there.

1427
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:32,180
Sometimes too much.

1428
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:39,100
Jeff, who went out on location to, you know, look at the Folsom Geocache, specifically

1429
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:41,180
left the live show, The Mumble Room, today.

1430
01:13:41,180 --> 01:13:44,780
So that way he could listen to the live stream while he's road tripping.

1431
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:45,780
That's a thing.

1432
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:49,420
At the meetups, some of the listeners that drove quite a ways to make it to the meetups

1433
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:51,420
were like, yeah, I just listened to the live version on the way up here.

1434
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:53,220
It kills like, you know, a few hours.

1435
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:54,580
Sometimes it is that long.

1436
01:13:54,580 --> 01:13:58,420
You know, there's only so much content in a week and the more the better.

1437
01:13:58,420 --> 01:14:00,020
Yeah, it's pretty wild.

1438
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:03,700
Links to what we talked about today and all that kind of stuff are over at LinuxUnplugged.com

1439
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:04,700
slash 484.

1440
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:06,700
Is that where we're at?

1441
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:07,700
484.

1442
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:08,700
You heard our Mumble Room.

1443
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:09,700
We got a Mumble Room.

1444
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:10,860
It's over there if you'd like to join it.

1445
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:14,020
It's a great way to listen in real time or participate in the show if something strikes

1446
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:15,020
your fancy.

1447
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:18,460
We have details for that at JupiterBroadcasting.com.

1448
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:19,460
Find the Mumble stuff.

1449
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:20,460
It's a slash mumble.

1450
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:22,020
Same with the Matrix details.

1451
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:26,700
And yeah, shout out to our buddy Carl George who got the latest and greatest mumble packaged

1452
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:28,220
up in Fedora 37.

1453
01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:31,420
So you know, PipeWire, mumble, it's a great setup to join the show.

1454
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:32,420
All I'm saying.

1455
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:33,420
Yep.

1456
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:37,140
If you're going to upgrade, might as well upgrade in style and go mumble with PipeWire.

1457
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:38,140
You know what else?

1458
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:42,740
Speaking of adding PipeWire support, as we record today, a new version of MPV is out

1459
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:44,780
that has a PipeWire back in too.

1460
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:45,780
Mm-hmm.

1461
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:47,260
Loving that MPV.

1462
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:51,780
I'm glad we gave it a mention today because we just don't talk about it enough.

1463
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:55,060
And then last but not least, if you're not doing anything on your Sunday and you want

1464
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:59,260
to hang out with your Linux buddies, head over to Jupiter.tube around noon Pacific three

1465
01:14:59,260 --> 01:15:00,260
p.m.

1466
01:15:00,260 --> 01:15:03,560
Eastern and, you know, watch the show.

1467
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:07,700
We stream it live over there and you can see how handsome Brent is.

1468
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:08,700
See how we make the sausage.

1469
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:10,540
Here are all our mistakes.

1470
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:12,180
Noon Pacific three p.m.

1471
01:15:12,180 --> 01:15:13,180
Eastern Jupiter.tube.

1472
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:15,180
See you next week.

1473
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:16,460
Same bad time.

1474
01:15:16,460 --> 01:15:17,460
Same bad station.

1475
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:19,180
All right, gentlemen.

1476
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:20,180
Did we do it?

1477
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:21,180
Is that it?

1478
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:22,180
I don't know if any of us are.

1479
01:15:22,180 --> 01:15:24,980
I don't know if any of us are sticking with Fedora 37 after this.

1480
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:26,380
I don't think I am.

1481
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:29,220
I might give Fedora 36 a go.

1482
01:15:29,220 --> 01:15:31,860
Yeah, I got to go fix Fedora 36.

1483
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:32,860
Right?

1484
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:34,340
I'm going to see how long it sticks.

1485
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:35,980
I'm not going to get rid of it like.

1486
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:36,980
Yeah.

1487
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:37,980
Right away.

1488
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:38,980
We'll see.

1489
01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:39,980
We'll see.

1490
01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:40,980
We'll see.

1491
01:15:40,980 --> 01:15:41,980
I am really enjoying this gnome.

1492
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:42,980
So it is nice.

1493
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:45,560
They are doing great.

1494
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:46,560
Don't miss Linux Action News.

1495
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:49,380
There's more at LinuxActionNews.com.

1496
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:52,620
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

1497
01:15:52,620 --> 01:16:20,780
And we'll see you right back here next Sunday.

1498
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:33,940
Minimac, you had a question, though, during the deepfake.

1499
01:16:33,940 --> 01:16:37,460
Yeah, I want to learn something today.

1500
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:40,660
So the idea is, how does it work?

1501
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:43,540
I try to imagine how it works.

1502
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:48,640
Like you have a lot of episodes and then first you have to define the voice patterns.

1503
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:51,940
So this is Chris, this is Brent, this is Wes.

1504
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:57,900
Once the AI has recognized these voice patterns, you can probably pass other love episodes

1505
01:16:57,900 --> 01:17:01,700
and just let them separate the voice strings.

1506
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:06,900
I would think it's more like he has to cut me out and just only supply it with my cuts.

1507
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:10,340
So maybe we will have an answer afterwards.

1508
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:19,340
Then I would probably you will have to pass a voice to text pattern to have a text database

1509
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:25,300
with the words, like on the bottom you have a database with like 50 is and if the home

1510
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:31,660
and I don't know what, then probably if that is possible, I will try to level that thing

1511
01:17:31,660 --> 01:17:35,780
so that the is is always like the same kind.

1512
01:17:35,780 --> 01:17:42,380
And once you have like if you have 50 times the same words so that that AI engine could

1513
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:50,500
level it so it would define Chris normally uses the bird home like this and then once

1514
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:56,340
you have it leveled, then you can start to make some sentences.

1515
01:17:56,340 --> 01:18:02,140
Well I use the tool, it's actually developed originally by Mozilla.

1516
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:10,700
It's called Koki, C-O-Q-U-I and the way it works actually is you you feed it lots of

1517
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:16,100
samples, generally between one second and up to 10 seconds.

1518
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:19,140
That really depends on your training hardware.

1519
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:23,740
I have a RTX Titan that I use for training.

1520
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:30,700
And so with 24 gigs, you kind of top out at about 10 seconds with what did I use batch

1521
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:39,180
size of I believe I use 48 samples per batch and what you do is you you get as many samples

1522
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:42,980
as you can and what I did was a very painstaking process.

1523
01:18:42,980 --> 01:18:50,660
I went through a whole bunch of episodes including LUP, Coder and SSH and I manually went and

1524
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:54,260
found clips of Chris speaking.

1525
01:18:54,260 --> 01:19:03,180
I got about 48 minutes worth, broke it up into various clips, then I ran a speech to

1526
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:11,860
text parser over all of it, then I re-listened to everything just to ensure that the transcoded

1527
01:19:11,860 --> 01:19:20,220
text is correct and then that gets fed into the AI trainer and then as it goes along it

1528
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:26,780
spits out the model after various steps and then you use that model to then you just feed

1529
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:29,680
it a line of text to work out.

1530
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:36,580
The problem is I just did not have the time or patience to get any more audio.

1531
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:37,580
Already a lot.

1532
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:39,980
48 minutes is way too low.

1533
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:41,760
You need minimum 2-3 hours.

1534
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:46,060
Some of the larger data sets that actually are used to build these text-to-speech models

1535
01:19:46,060 --> 01:19:49,780
are in the range of 20 plus hours worth.

1536
01:19:49,780 --> 01:19:56,820
So if I had the time and I went through all of the back catalogue of the shows of Chris

1537
01:19:56,820 --> 01:20:02,780
talking I could probably build a very comprehensible model.

1538
01:20:02,780 --> 01:20:04,420
I would not wish that on anyone.

1539
01:20:04,420 --> 01:20:05,420
Don't do that.

1540
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:06,420
A JB intern.

1541
01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:15,860
So if you had some snippets of Chris reading some text, like some pages of text, it would

1542
01:20:15,860 --> 01:20:16,860
be much easier.

1543
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:25,420
Right now you have to really cut the speech pieces of Chris from the show and feed it

1544
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:26,420
manually.

1545
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:29,100
Yeah, exactly.

1546
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:33,060
I think really you just need a few topics that Chris can rant about on his soapbox and

1547
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:35,860
then you've got enough content right there.

1548
01:20:35,860 --> 01:20:41,140
It's a great point because you actually need a variety of phenoms, I think is that the

1549
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:42,420
right word?

1550
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:46,080
Basically the individual parts of words.

1551
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:52,620
You need a large range of that for the AI to be able to learn how the individual speaker

1552
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:54,740
says that to then be able to reproduce it.

1553
01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:59,220
Yeah, if you don't have enough variability in the base set.

1554
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:04,280
In the clip I generated, I didn't write one million sats, I wrote 900,000 sats because

1555
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:10,520
none of the clips I had pulled out had Chris saying the word million.

1556
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:15,100
So whenever I tried actually doing a million in the generated speech, it just sounded kind

1557
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:16,100
of garbled.

1558
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:17,100
It didn't actually make sense.

1559
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:18,100
Very interesting.

1560
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:20,100
Thank you for the information.

1561
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:25,780
And to actually just put a finer point on it, if you've seen the show Kenobi, the voice

1562
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:30,340
of Darth Vader was not actually voiced by James Earl Jones.

1563
01:21:30,340 --> 01:21:33,060
That was actually the same thing.

1564
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:39,540
It was an AI generated model that they had built from James Earl Jones's voice.

1565
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:44,500
And I don't know if you've seen the news, but he has signed basically, I'm not sure

1566
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:49,620
what it's called, but basically a perpetual permission for Disney to now use his likeness,

1567
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:52,020
his voice for Darth Vader going forward.

1568
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:56,780
So going forward, any appearances of Darth Vader are going to be AI generated voices,

1569
01:21:56,780 --> 01:21:59,220
not James Earl himself recording it.

1570
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:03,420
Yeah, I've read an article about that.

1571
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:08,240
You know, CB, it strikes me too that like, say we were serious about ever doing something

1572
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:09,500
like this.

1573
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:15,740
One thing that if you were working with JB, like we have stems of just my track to a degree,

1574
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:20,220
we don't have like a lot of them, but we have probably weeks worth of just my track in the

1575
01:22:20,220 --> 01:22:23,360
episodes too, which would probably make it easier, I would think to sample from, because

1576
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:27,240
then you could just drop the silences and essentially just have...

1577
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:33,620
It would be incredibly easier if someone had just handed me these pristine audio files

1578
01:22:33,620 --> 01:22:35,380
with nothing else mixed in.

1579
01:22:35,380 --> 01:22:42,300
Because I had to cut past some of the other speakers and over speaking and someone using

1580
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:46,860
the soundboard, yeah, soundboard mixed in, yeah, that's absolutely true.

1581
01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:47,860
Absolutely.

1582
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:53,900
Would the Mozilla organization feed some example text that makes it easier?

1583
01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:58,220
Because if they're working on that, it would be also cool if they hand out some example

1584
01:22:58,220 --> 01:23:06,140
text that someone could read and somehow you get really a good sample of the voice.

1585
01:23:06,140 --> 01:23:08,580
Like a script that helps train it a little bit.

1586
01:23:08,580 --> 01:23:09,820
That's true too.

1587
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:10,820
That's true too.

1588
01:23:10,820 --> 01:23:19,860
But for example, even doing some of the visual deepfakes, so deepfaking a person's face,

1589
01:23:19,860 --> 01:23:26,220
if you're trying to get, trying to do it of a celebrity, for whatever reason, it's harder

1590
01:23:26,220 --> 01:23:33,220
to find all the different angles and the different movements of the mouth and the expressions.

1591
01:23:33,220 --> 01:23:37,580
However, if you're doing it yourself, you want to deepfake yourself or you're doing

1592
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:43,820
it for a movie or whatever, you basically stand somebody in front of a camera and you

1593
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:47,600
have them, I don't know what they're called, but there is these phrases that you can say

1594
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:52,500
that force the speaker to move their mouth in a particular pattern.

1595
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:54,860
And to capture that.

1596
01:23:54,860 --> 01:23:55,860
Exactly.

1597
01:23:55,860 --> 01:24:00,220
And the same thing with doing the audio.

1598
01:24:00,220 --> 01:24:05,380
If you had a script, you have a variety of words, something that forces the voice to

1599
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:11,260
do the expressions and the different ranges that you would normally say in regular conversation.

1600
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:12,660
Now read it again as a prospector.

1601
01:24:12,660 --> 01:24:13,660
Yeah.

1602
01:24:13,660 --> 01:24:14,660
Yeah.

1603
01:24:14,660 --> 01:24:15,660
Give me the prospector voice.

1604
01:24:15,660 --> 01:24:16,660
Yeah.

1605
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:18,060
You got to get all the different iterations and you got to make sure you capture all of

1606
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:23,580
the terms that we use a lot, ZFS, Linux, you know, that kind of stuff.

1607
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:25,380
It actually did pretty well with all that stuff.

1608
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:26,380
Did it?

1609
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:28,020
I was going to ask you, how does it handle those kinds of terms?

1610
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:31,740
Is it just, is it just because I say it and so it just learns it?

1611
01:24:31,740 --> 01:24:35,740
Well, yes, because you say it, but also because when it does the learning, it doesn't learn

1612
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:36,740
individual words.

1613
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:39,460
It learns the little, the parts of the words, right?

1614
01:24:39,460 --> 01:24:45,380
So you say ZFS or zebra, you still have that sound in there that it's going to learn and

1615
01:24:45,380 --> 01:25:02,660
then piece it together.
