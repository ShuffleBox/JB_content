WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.180
You all laugh at me when I talk about using Vivaldi,

00:02.180 --> 00:04.000
but I don't know if you saw this the other week.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.040
They took to their blog, and they're

00:06.040 --> 00:09.720
campaigning for Windows 7 users to switch to Linux.

00:09.720 --> 00:10.360
Wow.

00:10.360 --> 00:10.920
Come on.

00:10.920 --> 00:11.920
I support those.

00:11.920 --> 00:13.080
This is a great browser.

00:13.080 --> 00:14.640
First of all, if you want something

00:14.640 --> 00:16.680
that uses the Blink rendering engine that's

00:16.680 --> 00:20.000
based on Chromium, but rips out all the Google stuff.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.200
I should use Edge?

00:22.200 --> 00:23.440
No.

00:23.440 --> 00:23.940
No.

00:23.940 --> 00:24.440
Yes.

00:24.440 --> 00:34.840
Hello, friends, and welcome into the Unplugged program.

00:34.840 --> 00:37.920
My, you have chosen quite wisely.

00:37.920 --> 00:38.720
My name is Chris.

00:38.720 --> 00:39.520
My name is Wes.

00:39.520 --> 00:42.120
I say that because you can listen to this episode

00:42.120 --> 00:42.920
and then go home.

00:42.920 --> 00:44.000
You're done for the rest of the year.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.460
We're going to tell you everything

00:45.460 --> 00:48.720
that's going to happen in 2020 right here.

00:48.720 --> 00:50.640
Can you believe I'm even saying that?

00:50.640 --> 00:53.440
And to help us get it right, of course, the judge returns.

00:53.440 --> 00:54.200
Hello, Joe.

00:54.200 --> 00:54.760
Hello.

00:54.760 --> 00:57.080
I'm going to be even stunner than last time.

00:57.080 --> 00:57.920
Oh, good.

00:57.920 --> 01:00.400
Oh, good, because that turned out so well for me.

01:00.400 --> 01:03.560
And this time, adding their predictions into the pile

01:03.560 --> 01:05.800
is Alex, Cheese, and Brent.

01:05.800 --> 01:06.800
Welcome back, guys.

01:06.800 --> 01:07.760
Hello.

01:07.760 --> 01:08.720
I'm so nervous.

01:08.720 --> 01:11.160
I didn't know that was the homework.

01:11.160 --> 01:14.760
Well, Brent, I'll let you just slide in.

01:14.760 --> 01:18.080
I'll come to you last so you can pontificate as we put

01:18.080 --> 01:19.560
our hearts and souls out there.

01:19.560 --> 01:20.880
How are you feeling, Wes?

01:20.880 --> 01:22.320
You got your predictions ready?

01:22.320 --> 01:24.220
You know, I've spent a lot of time preparing

01:24.220 --> 01:25.480
since the last episode.

01:25.480 --> 01:27.320
So I think I'm going to do better this year.

01:27.320 --> 01:30.040
All right, well, something I wanted to do from time to time

01:30.040 --> 01:32.200
is check in on the old Arch server that we set up.

01:32.200 --> 01:34.880
So get yourself an SSH connection there, Wes,

01:34.880 --> 01:39.160
because for, I think, what feels like the 400th time

01:39.160 --> 01:40.940
since we've installed this Arch box,

01:40.940 --> 01:44.720
we have an update to the Linux kernel, to Linux headers,

01:44.720 --> 01:46.160
to Node.js, and a wire guard.

01:46.160 --> 01:48.360
All right, we're on 5.4.3 right now.

01:48.360 --> 01:50.000
Are you ready, Wes Payne?

01:50.000 --> 01:53.280
Go ahead and install the latest updates.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.440
I am S-Y-U-ing right now.

01:55.440 --> 01:58.520
Now, this, of course, is our commitment to the audience.

01:58.520 --> 02:00.520
We're going to run an Arch server in production

02:00.520 --> 02:01.800
so you don't have to.

02:01.800 --> 02:04.360
Don't do what we're doing right now.

02:04.360 --> 02:07.080
But we're going to install these updates

02:07.080 --> 02:09.320
and reboot right here on air and see if it works.

02:09.320 --> 02:11.440
Installation in progress.

02:11.440 --> 02:12.320
Now, here's the thing.

02:12.320 --> 02:15.620
You notice on that list, did you notice what's missing?

02:15.620 --> 02:17.360
I don't see anything about ZFS on here.

02:17.360 --> 02:18.680
Exactly.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.480
No ZFS DKMS modules.

02:20.480 --> 02:22.960
Hey, I see it building right now, though.

02:22.960 --> 02:23.480
Oh, really?

02:23.480 --> 02:23.980
Mm-hmm.

02:23.980 --> 02:24.880
OK, good.

02:24.880 --> 02:25.920
Good.

02:25.920 --> 02:28.160
All right, that's a good, that is, that's good.

02:28.160 --> 02:31.000
I also see some snapper pre-snapshots.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.880
Also what we want to see.

02:32.880 --> 02:34.560
I'm kind of loving this server.

02:34.560 --> 02:36.640
I really hope it comes up after this reboot,

02:36.640 --> 02:38.400
because this will be a pretty good,

02:38.400 --> 02:41.400
this will be the third big series of rounds of updates

02:41.400 --> 02:41.900
we've done.

02:41.900 --> 02:43.800
Is it just me, or is Pac-Man just pretty?

02:43.800 --> 02:45.520
I mean, I realize it's not the most sophisticated package

02:45.520 --> 02:47.040
manager out there, but the output

02:47.040 --> 02:49.280
is so clean and just what you need to know.

02:49.280 --> 02:50.200
I love it.

02:50.200 --> 02:52.000
And you can get little helpers that

02:52.000 --> 02:54.520
add lots of different little colors and all kinds of stuff.

02:54.520 --> 02:55.520
It's been a lot of fun.

02:55.520 --> 02:58.000
There is a hidden flag in etsypacman.conf

02:58.000 --> 03:03.020
to turn the little update bars into Pac-Man eating.

03:03.020 --> 03:04.440
We should do that on the server.

03:04.440 --> 03:04.940
You're right.

03:04.940 --> 03:05.640
It's appropriate.

03:05.640 --> 03:07.920
Yeah, so it's a little Pac-Man eating the dots

03:07.920 --> 03:09.060
as it installs packages.

03:09.060 --> 03:09.840
It's adorable.

03:09.840 --> 03:10.980
Where are we at there, Wes?

03:10.980 --> 03:14.760
We are currently installing the new ZFS modules,

03:14.760 --> 03:15.800
as built by DKMS.

03:15.800 --> 03:18.200
So it is rebuilding the ZFS modules,

03:18.200 --> 03:21.520
even though there isn't a package update for ZFS.

03:21.520 --> 03:23.040
That's good.

03:23.040 --> 03:25.120
That means we have a good shot of this thing booting up

03:25.120 --> 03:25.720
correctly.

03:25.720 --> 03:27.320
So we still have a Wirecard to go.

03:27.320 --> 03:29.240
I hope that goes as seamlessly.

03:29.240 --> 03:30.200
Oh, my gosh.

03:30.200 --> 03:32.520
Especially since after this, we're done,

03:32.520 --> 03:34.600
and we're going to be remote.

03:34.600 --> 03:35.560
So we really need this.

03:35.560 --> 03:36.800
I'd like access to the studio.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.320
We really need this to work.

03:38.320 --> 03:40.880
Oh, we're getting a new Node.js too, so that's good.

03:40.880 --> 03:43.840
Yeah, will that affect NetData?

03:43.840 --> 03:45.960
Depends a bit, I think, on how we have installed it.

03:45.960 --> 03:46.480
OK.

03:46.480 --> 03:49.680
So are we going to wait in real time while the server reboots?

03:49.680 --> 03:51.480
Yeah, we're going to find out what happens.

03:51.480 --> 03:52.960
Then that's all we got for the show, folks.

03:52.960 --> 03:53.680
Yeah, that's it.

03:53.680 --> 03:56.320
This is the show.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.000
That's installing Arch updates.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.400
We'll come back to it.

03:59.400 --> 04:00.760
I mean, we're not going to sit here while we wait,

04:00.760 --> 04:02.440
but we are going to do this in the show.

04:02.440 --> 04:02.760
You know what I mean?

04:02.760 --> 04:03.640
Is it still going over there?

04:03.640 --> 04:04.280
Yep, still going.

04:04.280 --> 04:04.960
OK.

04:04.960 --> 04:06.240
All right, so check in on that.

04:06.240 --> 04:08.440
In the meantime, while we wait for that to complete,

04:08.440 --> 04:11.160
which we will come back to, so brace yourselves,

04:11.160 --> 04:14.320
why don't we do ourselves a spot of housekeeping?

04:14.320 --> 04:19.000
I have great news.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.800
The internet's one and only daily Linux news podcast

04:23.800 --> 04:24.720
is back.

04:24.720 --> 04:26.080
Linux Headlines is back.

04:26.080 --> 04:28.280
Three minutes or less, find out everything

04:28.280 --> 04:31.680
that's happening in the world of Linux and open source.

04:31.680 --> 04:32.600
Boom.

04:32.600 --> 04:33.840
I missed it when it was gone.

04:33.840 --> 04:34.680
It's really nice.

04:34.680 --> 04:36.720
It's a good team effort, good team working on that.

04:36.720 --> 04:39.680
LinuxHeadlines.show.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.360
Right?

04:41.360 --> 04:41.840
Yes.

04:41.840 --> 04:43.360
Is that right?

04:43.360 --> 04:44.440
LinuxHeadlines.show.

04:44.440 --> 04:45.200
OK, good.

04:45.200 --> 04:45.960
I couldn't.

04:45.960 --> 04:47.280
I wasn't sure.

04:47.280 --> 04:48.080
And then.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.680
You only do it twice a week, so.

04:49.680 --> 04:50.320
You know, I know.

04:50.320 --> 04:52.040
I'm just one of the hosts.

04:52.040 --> 04:53.840
What would I know?

04:53.840 --> 04:56.400
And then also, something that Alex and I put together

04:56.400 --> 04:59.680
recently, really it was all mostly Alex,

04:59.680 --> 05:02.640
is a cheap do-it-yourself LED light strip

05:02.640 --> 05:05.320
using two open source projects video.

05:05.320 --> 05:06.840
It was a self-hosted live hack.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.920
It's up on our YouTube channel right now.

05:09.920 --> 05:12.160
And we'll have a link in the show notes.

05:12.160 --> 05:13.960
It's really worth checking out, because there

05:13.960 --> 05:16.480
is this really awesome firmware.

05:16.480 --> 05:17.880
You can flash on a device.

05:17.880 --> 05:19.840
I should let you tease it a little bit, Alex.

05:19.840 --> 05:24.760
So we teased in SSH 8 a new firmware called WLED.

05:24.760 --> 05:31.040
And that lets you take any ESP8266 or 32 device

05:31.040 --> 05:34.440
and flash a firmware on it that requires no coding,

05:34.440 --> 05:36.880
no Arduino code flashing, that kind of stuff.

05:36.880 --> 05:39.240
It's really slick.

05:39.240 --> 05:40.840
If I'm the referee for this episode,

05:40.840 --> 05:42.640
I'm not going to allow you to call it SSH.

05:42.640 --> 05:45.120
Call it self-hosted like it should be.

05:45.120 --> 05:45.920
Wow.

05:45.920 --> 05:47.040
Wow.

05:47.040 --> 05:51.200
Getting a little power hungry over there, Joe.

05:51.200 --> 05:53.920
Yeah, check out the self-hosted podcast, though.

05:53.920 --> 05:56.720
I'm really enjoying some of the recent discoveries.

05:56.720 --> 05:59.680
And as it turns out, Alex is in the process

05:59.680 --> 06:00.640
of getting a new home.

06:00.640 --> 06:03.920
And that makes for fantastic content for our podcast.

06:03.920 --> 06:06.680
And like a maniac, I have launched a personal project

06:06.680 --> 06:08.440
called Project Off Grid, and we're

06:08.440 --> 06:10.160
talking about both these huge projects

06:10.160 --> 06:12.760
in the self-hosted show, self-hosted.show.

06:12.760 --> 06:15.240
As you listen to this, Alex should be in his new house.

06:15.240 --> 06:16.600
Oh, my gosh.

06:16.600 --> 06:17.800
That's pretty exciting, buddy.

06:17.800 --> 06:18.880
Congratulations.

06:18.880 --> 06:21.000
All right.

06:21.000 --> 06:21.560
There you go.

06:21.560 --> 06:22.640
That's the housekeeping.

06:22.640 --> 06:24.160
So Mr. Wes Payne.

06:24.160 --> 06:27.040
I have no updates for you.

06:27.040 --> 06:30.280
We're still chugging away.

06:30.280 --> 06:32.480
It's the wire guard modules?

06:32.480 --> 06:34.200
No, we're still doing ZFS.

06:34.200 --> 06:35.560
Yeah, that's a big build.

06:35.560 --> 06:38.320
Even with 24 cores, that's a big build.

06:38.320 --> 06:40.840
I found the name of the Pac-Man setting that has,

06:40.840 --> 06:42.440
it's called Candy.

06:42.440 --> 06:44.440
And if you go in Pac-Man Conf and look for Candy,

06:44.440 --> 06:46.920
you can enable Pac-Man eating pieces of candy.

06:46.920 --> 06:48.320
We're going to do it.

06:48.320 --> 06:50.320
We're going to put a link in the show notes,

06:50.320 --> 06:54.560
linuxunplug.com slash 335.

06:54.560 --> 06:56.800
You know, Wes, you've got to come up

06:56.800 --> 06:58.320
with a way to do these faster.

06:58.320 --> 07:00.160
I mean, if I'm going to make you do it live on the show.

07:00.160 --> 07:00.440
You're right.

07:00.440 --> 07:01.400
I need to expedite.

07:01.400 --> 07:04.160
You've got to buy that Mac Pro.

07:04.160 --> 07:04.960
Callback.

07:04.960 --> 07:05.440
Callback.

07:05.440 --> 07:07.440
All right, should we check in in a little bit?

07:07.440 --> 07:08.200
You want to check in?

07:08.200 --> 07:08.700
All right.

07:08.700 --> 07:10.720
We could hammer out a few predictions.

07:10.720 --> 07:12.040
You keep an eye on that.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.840
Give me the old thumbs up.

07:13.840 --> 07:16.160
Don't hit a reboot, though, because I want the reboot

07:16.160 --> 07:16.920
to be captured live.

07:16.920 --> 07:17.440
Absolutely.

07:17.440 --> 07:18.920
All right, OK.

07:18.920 --> 07:21.080
All right, well, I was trying to stall a little bit

07:21.080 --> 07:23.120
because after last week's episode,

07:23.120 --> 07:25.800
I took such a beating on my reviews

07:25.800 --> 07:28.680
that I have been completely humbled.

07:28.680 --> 07:31.440
And I changed my approach for this episode.

07:31.440 --> 07:34.800
For this episode, I'm going more pie in the sky.

07:34.800 --> 07:37.560
I hope to thrill a little bit with the idea,

07:37.560 --> 07:39.280
and maybe I'll get lucky.

07:39.280 --> 07:41.940
I feel like I'm going to have the same chances as I did when

07:41.940 --> 07:43.800
I really thought about it.

07:43.800 --> 07:45.520
And then for my series predictions,

07:45.520 --> 07:47.200
the ones where I actually am trying

07:47.200 --> 07:49.520
to get competitive with Joe, I'm going to put those in Linux

07:49.520 --> 07:50.280
Action News.

07:50.280 --> 07:51.160
So many predictions.

07:51.160 --> 07:52.640
It's probably out by now.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.440
All right, so I'll start with one of mine,

07:54.440 --> 07:55.880
and then we'll go around the horn, and we'll each do one.

07:55.880 --> 07:57.760
I think we'll do three each, OK?

07:57.760 --> 07:58.480
That sounds good.

07:58.480 --> 08:00.560
We'll pick one of your, I've got more than three.

08:00.560 --> 08:01.840
Is the judge ready?

08:01.840 --> 08:03.400
I mean, we've got to make sure we hone these in,

08:03.400 --> 08:05.040
and then, of course, lock them in.

08:05.040 --> 08:07.880
If we have the judge's approval, I will begin.

08:07.880 --> 08:08.960
I will reveal one of my first predictions.

08:08.960 --> 08:10.160
The Honorable Judge.

08:10.160 --> 08:11.240
Yeah, let's hear it.

08:11.240 --> 08:12.460
All right, thank you, Judge.

08:12.460 --> 08:13.340
I appreciate that.

08:13.340 --> 08:15.080
Now, one thing to keep in mind, we

08:15.080 --> 08:17.740
will be stating our predictions such that we have to lock them

08:17.740 --> 08:20.160
in because we have to be accountable next year.

08:20.160 --> 08:22.320
So we'll probably talk through them,

08:22.320 --> 08:24.220
and then I'll probably ask each one of you

08:24.220 --> 08:26.260
to state it clearly for the lock-in, which

08:26.260 --> 08:31.200
will be followed by the official lock-in sound, which means

08:31.200 --> 08:32.600
you can't change it after that.

08:32.600 --> 08:33.280
And that's it.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.560
No going back.

08:34.560 --> 08:39.440
So for my first prediction, I predict in 2020,

08:39.440 --> 08:42.920
after Ubuntu 2004 is out the door,

08:42.920 --> 08:46.200
one of the interim releases in 2020,

08:46.200 --> 08:53.440
which would be the one in October, will switch to Wayland.

08:53.440 --> 08:54.280
What do you think?

08:54.280 --> 08:55.600
Is that like the default?

08:55.600 --> 08:58.400
So you install it, you boot up, you're in a Wayland session.

08:58.400 --> 09:01.200
Is that an admissible prediction, Judge,

09:01.200 --> 09:03.660
or is there any quabbles with that particular one?

09:03.660 --> 09:05.280
Well, you're saying specifically it's

09:05.280 --> 09:06.600
going to be in Ubuntu 2010.

09:06.600 --> 09:08.200
I think I am by process of elimination.

09:08.200 --> 09:09.640
I could make that clear in the prediction.

09:09.640 --> 09:10.560
I think I just have to.

09:10.560 --> 09:13.720
There's no other interim release, so all right.

09:13.720 --> 09:14.560
I'll make it now.

09:14.560 --> 09:15.760
I'll lock it in.

09:15.760 --> 09:19.840
I predict in 2020 that Canonical will switch the Ubuntu release

09:19.840 --> 09:24.480
over to Wayland in their 2010 release.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.280
Locked it in.

09:27.280 --> 09:27.920
I feel good.

09:27.920 --> 09:30.080
I've just realized that these Ubuntu releases are

09:30.080 --> 09:31.520
going to be very confusing.

09:31.520 --> 09:33.600
We're going to be thinking they're talking about years

09:33.600 --> 09:34.080
gone by.

09:34.080 --> 09:37.320
2010, it's too confusing.

09:37.320 --> 09:40.880
It's actually already confusing, because I have a small mind.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.600
No reboots yet, Wes?

09:42.600 --> 09:43.600
Nothing over there?

09:43.600 --> 09:44.200
Do we have a?

09:44.200 --> 09:46.680
Oh, oh, we're building ourselves a new initRAMFS,

09:46.680 --> 09:47.680
so that's a good start.

09:47.680 --> 09:49.160
So we're getting really close.

09:49.160 --> 09:51.720
Do you want to try to squeeze in a prediction before it?

09:51.720 --> 09:52.240
Yeah, OK.

09:52.240 --> 09:55.240
Well, so I had some reasonable luck last year

09:55.240 --> 09:56.680
about your personal preferences.

09:56.680 --> 09:58.560
I'm going to try that again.

09:58.560 --> 10:03.480
I think that in 2020, by the end of 2020,

10:03.480 --> 10:05.240
you will be on Manjaro.

10:05.240 --> 10:06.120
You may have dabbled.

10:06.120 --> 10:07.160
You may have switched away.

10:07.160 --> 10:09.600
But by the end of the year, you'll be back on Manjaro.

10:09.600 --> 10:11.160
OK, Judge, I feel like he's got to be

10:11.160 --> 10:13.040
specific on at least what machines,

10:13.040 --> 10:14.400
or at least a category of machines.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.680
But I'll leave it up to you.

10:15.680 --> 10:20.560
ThinkPad, workstation upstairs, both count in my mind.

10:20.560 --> 10:22.440
Now, you're saying I may go away.

10:22.440 --> 10:24.440
But at the end of the year, by the end of the year,

10:24.440 --> 10:25.120
I'll be on Manjaro.

10:25.120 --> 10:25.920
Yeah.

10:25.920 --> 10:27.720
I think we need to specify exactly what we

10:27.720 --> 10:29.080
mean by the end of the year.

10:29.080 --> 10:32.600
So by the time we record the predictions review episode.

10:32.600 --> 10:34.160
Yeah, that sounds good.

10:34.160 --> 10:35.080
All right.

10:35.080 --> 10:36.880
All right, lock it in there, Wes.

10:36.880 --> 10:40.080
I predict that by the next predictions episode,

10:40.080 --> 10:43.760
you, my friend, will be on Manjaro.

10:43.760 --> 10:45.240
All right, it's locked in.

10:45.240 --> 10:46.840
That's really an interesting idea,

10:46.840 --> 10:49.960
because I have been thoroughly enjoying my time on Manjaro.

10:49.960 --> 10:51.600
It's a bet for stability.

10:51.600 --> 10:54.880
That may go wrong knowing you, but I won't get a chance

10:54.880 --> 10:56.000
to reflect on it next year.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.480
You get stability along with access to the AUR,

10:59.480 --> 11:02.400
and then all of your packages update with one tool.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.040
Plus, you're so hooked on containers, right?

11:04.040 --> 11:06.320
So you have the ability to get all the stuff where you want.

11:06.320 --> 11:07.200
Huh.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.200
And I got snaps.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.160
And I got flat packs.

11:09.160 --> 11:11.320
And sometimes you're just lazy.

11:11.320 --> 11:12.120
Thanks, Wes.

11:12.120 --> 11:13.800
But what desktop environment, Wes?

11:13.800 --> 11:14.720
Bonus prediction.

11:14.720 --> 11:15.560
Oh, yeah.

11:15.560 --> 11:17.360
Random, random extra credit.

11:17.360 --> 11:18.080
What do you think?

11:18.080 --> 11:18.720
Plasma.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.480
Really?

11:20.480 --> 11:21.000
I don't know.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.840
I'm watching the Gnome Shell Mudder blog,

11:22.840 --> 11:25.200
and I'm looking at some of the improvements they're doing.

11:25.200 --> 11:28.400
And I'm thinking, that's speaking to me again.

11:28.400 --> 11:31.080
But of course, you give me another cycle.

11:31.080 --> 11:32.880
Yeah, there's a long time here.

11:32.880 --> 11:35.560
They're going to remove some feature that you're using.

11:35.560 --> 11:36.440
That's probably true.

11:36.440 --> 11:37.720
That's probably a safe prediction.

11:37.720 --> 11:39.140
These extra credit predictions are probably

11:39.140 --> 11:39.760
going to turn out all right.

11:39.760 --> 11:41.600
How's that server update looking?

11:41.600 --> 11:43.200
Are you feeling good?

11:43.200 --> 11:45.040
We are ready to reboot.

11:45.040 --> 11:46.200
OK.

11:46.200 --> 11:47.400
Let's do it, Wes.

11:47.400 --> 11:48.840
Let's reboot our production server.

11:48.840 --> 11:50.040
Now, will this disconnect?

11:50.040 --> 11:51.600
Because it's also doing DNS.

11:51.600 --> 11:55.680
So if we lose you guys, we'll pick you back up.

11:55.680 --> 11:57.080
No, we should be fine.

11:57.080 --> 11:57.600
All right.

11:57.600 --> 11:58.240
Kick it off, Wes.

11:58.240 --> 11:58.840
Let's do this.

11:58.840 --> 12:01.280
Well, let's get our ping going over here.

12:01.280 --> 12:02.720
Goodbye, sweet server.

12:02.720 --> 12:04.640
I hope you come back.

12:04.640 --> 12:05.160
Oh, no.

12:05.160 --> 12:06.440
See, you got to type your studio password.

12:06.440 --> 12:07.600
That's how that works.

12:07.600 --> 12:08.840
And reboot in progress.

12:08.840 --> 12:11.920
I got to say, that super micro we have in there is so solid.

12:11.920 --> 12:14.640
Buying from Unix Surplus was one of the best tips

12:14.640 --> 12:16.160
that Alan Jude ever gave me.

12:16.160 --> 12:17.720
It's really just been great for us.

12:17.720 --> 12:18.400
Yeah, it has.

12:18.400 --> 12:18.920
All right.

12:18.920 --> 12:21.920
The only problem is that it's a legit server,

12:21.920 --> 12:24.600
so it takes forever to reboot.

12:24.600 --> 12:26.640
My Raspberry Pis boot faster than that thing.

12:26.640 --> 12:28.400
You know, if we had an LTS distribution,

12:28.400 --> 12:30.560
we probably wouldn't have to update kernel so much.

12:30.560 --> 12:32.240
We wouldn't have to reboot so long.

12:32.240 --> 12:33.240
No, I'm just kidding.

12:33.240 --> 12:34.640
Oh, huh.

12:34.640 --> 12:37.200
You know, there's this live patch service I hear about.

12:37.200 --> 12:37.960
Oh.

12:37.960 --> 12:38.760
Yeah.

12:38.760 --> 12:40.360
That's sounding real attractive right now.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.540
You know what Arch ought to do is come up

12:41.540 --> 12:42.660
with a live patch service.

12:42.660 --> 12:43.720
Maybe it's in the AUR.

12:43.720 --> 12:47.480
So with VFIO, I actually end up having to rebuild my kernel

12:47.480 --> 12:48.960
relatively often.

12:48.960 --> 12:50.760
And I found quite a lot of success

12:50.760 --> 12:53.480
in switching to the Arch LTS kernels.

12:53.480 --> 12:54.560
Why didn't we do that?

12:54.560 --> 12:55.880
Yeah, that's a nice option.

12:55.880 --> 12:57.800
Why didn't we do the Arch LTS?

12:57.800 --> 13:00.560
When we did this whole minimal Arch install,

13:00.560 --> 13:02.640
how did that not cross our minds?

13:02.640 --> 13:04.560
There's ZFS LTS packages.

13:04.560 --> 13:06.060
Oh, we could investigate switching.

13:06.060 --> 13:08.560
Maybe that will be on a future episode of this show.

13:08.560 --> 13:10.280
Yeah, we should definitely try.

13:10.280 --> 13:11.840
We should definitely try.

13:11.840 --> 13:12.880
All right.

13:12.880 --> 13:14.920
Well, why don't we do another prediction?

13:14.920 --> 13:17.680
We'll come back and see how this is going.

13:17.680 --> 13:18.320
What do you say?

13:18.320 --> 13:19.880
I'll rudely interrupt as soon as it's back.

13:19.880 --> 13:20.880
Yeah, just give me the signal, because it

13:20.880 --> 13:21.880
does take a little bit.

13:21.880 --> 13:24.640
And I bet Cheesy you might be able to get one

13:24.640 --> 13:27.320
of your predictions in here.

13:27.320 --> 13:28.720
So why don't you start?

13:28.720 --> 13:34.000
Yeah, so I predict in 2020 that Linux

13:34.000 --> 13:37.320
becomes a viable option in the mobile space,

13:37.320 --> 13:42.720
whether that be on a tablet or, more importantly, on a phone.

13:42.720 --> 13:48.680
And to measure that, I say that UbiPorts

13:48.680 --> 13:52.560
will gain at least 1% market share in the mobile space

13:52.560 --> 13:54.240
operating system world.

13:54.240 --> 13:55.000
Whoa.

13:55.000 --> 13:55.960
That's pretty specific.

13:55.960 --> 13:59.600
Are you thinking the PinePhone here is going to play a factor?

13:59.600 --> 14:00.960
I'm thinking the PinePhone.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.160
I'm thinking the LeaveRoom.

14:02.160 --> 14:04.840
I'm thinking there are going to be other devices that

14:04.840 --> 14:08.200
may come out later in the year that we're not aware of yet.

14:08.200 --> 14:11.000
Have you used UbiPorts lately?

14:11.000 --> 14:11.800
I have.

14:11.800 --> 14:14.440
I've used UbiPorts on a Nexus 5 that's

14:14.440 --> 14:17.080
practically falling apart.

14:17.080 --> 14:18.120
It's come a long way.

14:18.120 --> 14:19.520
We've got pings.

14:19.520 --> 14:20.720
Oh, OK.

14:20.720 --> 14:22.240
We're back alive.

14:22.240 --> 14:23.680
All right, Cheesy, why don't you lock this in?

14:23.680 --> 14:24.680
What do you think, Judge?

14:24.680 --> 14:28.920
You got any clarifications you want before he locks it in?

14:28.920 --> 14:34.000
Are you sure you don't want to say 0.01% instead of 1%?

14:34.000 --> 14:38.120
You know, I thought about the 0.5 or the 0.5,

14:38.120 --> 14:39.880
but I'm just going to go bold.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.080
I say let's I'm doing it, too.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.120
Let's go for the thrills, Cheesy.

14:42.120 --> 14:42.840
Lock it in.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.320
Yeah, so I'm going to lock it in and say

14:44.320 --> 14:46.880
that Linux becomes a viable option in the mobile space.

14:46.880 --> 14:51.760
And to assert that, UbiPorts gains at least 1% market share

14:51.760 --> 14:54.000
in that mobile space.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.080
All right, I hope that one happens.

14:56.080 --> 14:57.440
That would be incredible.

14:57.440 --> 14:58.320
That would be really incredible.

14:58.320 --> 15:00.840
Now it's time to find out if all of our applications are dead

15:00.840 --> 15:02.400
and if our ZFS pool came back online

15:02.400 --> 15:03.440
and if WireGuard is viable.

15:03.440 --> 15:04.200
Wes Payne.

15:04.200 --> 15:05.600
We're back up and running.

15:05.600 --> 15:06.400
That's it?

15:06.400 --> 15:07.000
That's it.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.360
Isn't there some sort of drama, like Arch failed

15:09.360 --> 15:11.240
to do something or rolling caused

15:11.240 --> 15:12.880
some sort of horrible disaster?

15:12.880 --> 15:15.480
Nope, we're just on the latest kernel.

15:15.480 --> 15:16.480
It's fine.

15:16.480 --> 15:19.080
OK.

15:19.080 --> 15:21.200
That was very unsuspenseful.

15:21.200 --> 15:23.400
So far, that's how it's been.

15:23.400 --> 15:26.920
Yet, I have still gotten really anxious

15:26.920 --> 15:30.520
about every major kernel file system WireGuard update.

15:30.520 --> 15:32.440
Every single time, I'm still getting anxious.

15:32.440 --> 15:33.680
I have like range anxiety.

15:33.680 --> 15:38.200
I think we do need to do a test run of our rollback strategy.

15:38.200 --> 15:39.480
That probably would make me feel better.

15:39.480 --> 15:40.720
Yeah, because otherwise, I'm feeling

15:40.720 --> 15:41.640
pretty confident about it.

15:41.640 --> 15:42.120
Yeah.

15:42.120 --> 15:43.680
And we have been staying very current.

15:43.680 --> 15:44.360
So that's good.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.760
And I think that's keeping it easy.

15:45.760 --> 15:50.200
Both of us are just always SSHing and updating.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.760
That's how you admin, folks.

15:51.760 --> 15:54.120
It's pretty funny that Frankenstein's monster

15:54.120 --> 15:56.040
of a server reboots no problem.

15:56.040 --> 16:00.720
And yet, my Ubuntu LTS-based NAS box, often it'll reboot.

16:00.720 --> 16:04.480
And my ext4 volume is just read-only.

16:04.480 --> 16:06.400
And I have to reboot again.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.800
So maybe there is something to this arch business.

16:08.800 --> 16:09.840
I'll tell you what, too.

16:09.840 --> 16:10.800
This thing's no slouch.

16:10.800 --> 16:14.640
It's got a dozen or so different containerized applications

16:14.640 --> 16:17.200
running on it, maybe more, because Nextclub

16:17.200 --> 16:19.080
pulls in like 100 of them.

16:19.080 --> 16:21.600
It's all about the containers, not the OS.

16:21.600 --> 16:25.200
Now, Mr. Alex, let's say you get yourself

16:25.200 --> 16:26.680
an opportunity for a prediction.

16:26.680 --> 16:29.180
Which one are you going to go with for your first prediction

16:29.180 --> 16:30.000
for 2020?

16:30.000 --> 16:33.720
I predict that there will be a consumer-grade 20-terabyte

16:33.720 --> 16:36.160
hard drive available in 2020.

16:36.160 --> 16:37.560
Wow, that's pretty specific, Judge.

16:37.560 --> 16:38.320
That is specific.

16:38.320 --> 16:42.600
Are we talking an internal SATA one, or are we talking USB,

16:42.600 --> 16:43.240
or what?

16:43.240 --> 16:46.680
3 and 1 half-inch SATA consumer-grade.

16:46.680 --> 16:47.640
Spinning Rust.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.880
Spinning Rust hard drive, yeah, 20 terabytes.

16:49.880 --> 16:52.380
Are you going to tell us how much you think it's going to be?

16:52.380 --> 16:54.280
Could be an extra bonus prediction.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.240
OK, so yes, I'll do a bonus.

16:56.240 --> 16:58.920
We'll do an addendum prediction.

16:58.920 --> 17:04.480
14 terabytes just now at Best Buy went down to about $210.

17:04.480 --> 17:09.080
So I would say $250, maybe?

17:09.080 --> 17:10.200
I would have gone $380.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.520
I think I would have said $380.

17:11.520 --> 17:13.600
Well, it depends if they get in the easy store or not.

17:13.600 --> 17:16.120
Because if they do, then Best Buy will sell them for cheap.

17:16.120 --> 17:19.600
If they don't, then they'll be in that $300, $400 range.

17:19.600 --> 17:22.560
All right, we'll put together your primary prediction

17:22.560 --> 17:25.320
in a nice soundbite, and we'll lock it in.

17:25.320 --> 17:27.960
There will be a 3 and 1 half-inch hard drive

17:27.960 --> 17:33.880
available to consumers of at least 20 terabytes in capacity.

17:33.880 --> 17:35.360
I hope that's true.

17:35.360 --> 17:37.400
I really do hope that's true.

17:37.400 --> 17:39.880
Because that would be nice to fill the NAS up with those.

17:39.880 --> 17:40.880
You know what I'm saying?

17:40.880 --> 17:42.440
OK, very good.

17:42.440 --> 17:42.920
Very good.

17:42.920 --> 17:44.800
Now, Brent, I'm going to come back to you in a little bit

17:44.800 --> 17:45.680
unless you're ready to go.

17:45.680 --> 17:47.640
But I was going to give you some time since you

17:47.640 --> 17:49.400
were surprised by the work today.

17:49.400 --> 17:50.800
You didn't have time for homework.

17:50.800 --> 17:53.480
I've been inspired, and I've been scribbling.

17:53.480 --> 17:55.000
So I think I got something.

17:55.000 --> 17:55.960
OK, all right, Brent.

17:55.960 --> 17:59.380
Then why don't you lay on us your first prediction for 2020?

17:59.380 --> 18:03.840
Well, I predict that in Q3 2020, we

18:03.840 --> 18:07.880
will see the Librem 5 be released just sort of publicly.

18:07.880 --> 18:10.880
None of this falling-apart business.

18:10.880 --> 18:14.640
Sort of their main phone available for anybody, Q3.

18:14.640 --> 18:17.080
The final production unit available for purchase

18:17.080 --> 18:19.000
or just shipping?

18:19.000 --> 18:19.840
I think there's a difference.

18:19.840 --> 18:22.440
They may finally get it out, but they might not.

18:22.440 --> 18:23.840
They might wait.

18:23.840 --> 18:25.120
I wonder if they'll make a.

18:25.120 --> 18:28.560
See, my concern there is there might be a different version

18:28.560 --> 18:30.000
that ends up for general purchase

18:30.000 --> 18:33.160
than there was the one that was crowdfunded.

18:33.160 --> 18:34.800
Do you want to make a call there,

18:34.800 --> 18:36.720
or is there a way we could word it where

18:36.720 --> 18:38.000
you think it includes both?

18:38.000 --> 18:40.280
Well, that would be too easy.

18:40.280 --> 18:43.560
I mean, the final production-grade version

18:43.560 --> 18:46.080
of the Librem would be shipping in Q3?

18:46.080 --> 18:48.640
I mean, the problem with that, when

18:48.640 --> 18:53.720
you go with the crowdfunders, is what is production-ready?

18:53.720 --> 18:57.000
So I think the public one, ready for purchase for public,

18:57.000 --> 18:58.840
is easier to define, even though it

18:58.840 --> 19:00.320
wrecks my chances, most likely.

19:00.320 --> 19:02.360
It is a little more limited, but it's also bold.

19:02.360 --> 19:03.560
I think if you're going to be specific,

19:03.560 --> 19:05.800
you should say something along the lines of,

19:05.800 --> 19:07.580
you can buy it from their website

19:07.580 --> 19:10.720
and have it delivered to you in the US within a week.

19:10.720 --> 19:12.360
That time frame, though, might get you,

19:12.360 --> 19:14.480
because they can't really.

19:14.480 --> 19:17.360
Oh, Amazon's going to get them.

19:17.360 --> 19:18.600
All right, OK.

19:18.600 --> 19:21.480
A bonus question on that is, how much

19:21.480 --> 19:24.760
do you think that device will actually

19:24.760 --> 19:28.240
ship for when it's all said and done?

19:28.240 --> 19:30.720
They did just raise the price, I think, $100 or something

19:30.720 --> 19:31.600
like that, didn't they?

19:31.600 --> 19:33.240
Isn't it going to be $2,000?

19:33.240 --> 19:34.640
No, that's the US version.

19:34.640 --> 19:38.880
But the totally compromised, that you can't trust version

19:38.880 --> 19:42.200
is, I just think, raised up to $700.

19:42.200 --> 19:43.600
Isn't that the implicit statement?

19:43.600 --> 19:45.760
If you have two versions, isn't the implicit statement

19:45.760 --> 19:47.680
that the other one isn't secure?

19:47.680 --> 19:49.400
I just think that's a weird statement.

19:49.400 --> 19:52.240
All right, but anyways, I think it's great that one of us

19:52.240 --> 19:54.000
is going to make a prediction around this,

19:54.000 --> 19:56.160
it's anyone's game, and I think we'd all

19:56.160 --> 19:57.320
like to see it actually ship.

19:57.320 --> 20:00.480
So Brent, do you have a lockable version of that?

20:00.480 --> 20:05.920
I predict in Q3 2020, the Librem 5 phone

20:05.920 --> 20:09.680
will be available to purchase on their website

20:09.680 --> 20:14.760
and shipable for anyone in the public, not crowd funders.

20:14.760 --> 20:23.160
For a bonus, it'll be within the $800 to $899 price range.

20:23.160 --> 20:24.520
All right, it's locked.

20:24.520 --> 20:25.720
It's locked, Brent.

20:25.720 --> 20:26.800
Good, I like that.

20:26.800 --> 20:28.120
Why did you pick Q3?

20:28.120 --> 20:29.920
I'm interested in that.

20:29.920 --> 20:33.000
Because it's a long time from now, but not completely

20:33.000 --> 20:35.600
at the end.

20:35.600 --> 20:39.600
It seems, yeah, that's pretty reasonable.

20:39.600 --> 20:40.120
OK.

20:40.120 --> 20:43.000
I remember they've put out a lot of news in Q3,

20:43.000 --> 20:44.520
not so much in Q4.

20:44.520 --> 20:46.400
Are you ready for one of my little sillier ones,

20:46.400 --> 20:48.560
but I would love to see it happen?

20:48.560 --> 20:53.640
My prediction for 2020 is that Plasma Shell on Chrome OS

20:53.640 --> 20:57.600
will become available somehow, either officially or hacked,

20:57.600 --> 21:01.080
including potentially the Plasma Shell release that's

21:01.080 --> 21:04.360
in a Docker container, which there is one already.

21:04.360 --> 21:06.520
I think KDE Neon releases in a container.

21:06.520 --> 21:07.240
What does it mean?

21:07.240 --> 21:09.720
So unofficially, how do we, is this one person

21:09.720 --> 21:12.080
who has a build up on GitHub, or is it a Linux post?

21:12.080 --> 21:13.000
But it's reproducible.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.560
It has to be like you and I could set it up.

21:15.560 --> 21:18.280
So you get a Chromebook, you install the Linux environment,

21:18.280 --> 21:20.840
you run this script, boom, you got Plasma Shell.

21:20.840 --> 21:21.960
Well, I've got a Chromebook.

21:21.960 --> 21:24.120
So you could say that Joe has to get

21:24.120 --> 21:27.160
Plasma running on his Chromebook.

21:27.160 --> 21:30.080
But then will I deliberately fail to do it just to spite you?

21:30.080 --> 21:33.200
I wonder if the issue would be like you have

21:33.200 --> 21:35.560
to have a GPU kwin supports.

21:35.560 --> 21:37.600
So that could be tricky.

21:37.600 --> 21:38.960
And if it's in a container, you'd

21:38.960 --> 21:42.600
have to get a container that Chrome OS would run.

21:42.600 --> 21:45.800
And it doesn't necessarily mean the things

21:45.800 --> 21:46.440
would get passed through.

21:46.440 --> 21:49.320
So this has a lot of ifs, ands, buts, maybes.

21:49.320 --> 21:52.680
However, I just am in love with the idea

21:52.680 --> 21:55.040
of an alternative free desktop getting

21:55.040 --> 21:57.480
loaded on top of Chrome OS for some reason.

21:57.480 --> 22:02.160
I was going to say Gnome Shell, but then thinking about it,

22:02.160 --> 22:04.120
I thought, no, it's probably more likely

22:04.120 --> 22:06.400
with the modularity of Plasma, they

22:06.400 --> 22:07.920
could get different components working

22:07.920 --> 22:08.880
with different workarounds.

22:08.880 --> 22:10.920
It's going to be more flexible, easy to sort of hack it in.

22:10.920 --> 22:13.120
Yeah, so I think that's my prediction now.

22:13.120 --> 22:15.360
Do I need to tweak it a little bit?

22:15.360 --> 22:17.800
I don't know if I'm going to say like your machine specifically,

22:17.800 --> 22:19.320
because that could be GPU limited,

22:19.320 --> 22:23.040
but I could get all the way there except for that one issue.

22:23.040 --> 22:25.560
It's too limiting, I think.

22:25.560 --> 22:30.160
I think essentially what has to have happened

22:30.160 --> 22:32.080
is there has to be a reproducible method

22:32.080 --> 22:34.040
to run the Plasma Shell on Chrome OS

22:34.040 --> 22:38.200
by this time next year, which is late December as we record.

22:38.200 --> 22:41.800
And if it's via Shell script on GitHub

22:41.800 --> 22:47.000
or a full screen VM environment, I don't know,

22:47.000 --> 22:48.880
but it'll happen.

22:48.880 --> 22:49.760
What do you think?

22:49.760 --> 22:51.040
Yeah, I think that's reasonable.

22:51.040 --> 22:53.240
All right, I'll try to see, how can I summarize that?

22:53.240 --> 22:54.640
I need to tighten that a little bit,

22:54.640 --> 22:56.040
because it's kind of a little floaty, right?

22:56.040 --> 22:56.560
Yeah, it is.

22:56.560 --> 22:57.280
All right, I'll give a shot at it.

22:57.280 --> 22:58.600
Tell me what you think of this.

22:58.600 --> 23:02.040
I predict in 2020 that by some means,

23:02.040 --> 23:06.560
it will be possible to run Plasma Shell on top of Chrome OS

23:06.560 --> 23:07.840
before the end of the year.

23:07.840 --> 23:10.400
All right, I mean, it's a little tight,

23:10.400 --> 23:12.920
but I'd love to see it, you know?

23:12.920 --> 23:15.000
I mean, if I could get a Chromebook for a couple hundred

23:15.000 --> 23:15.520
bucks.

23:15.520 --> 23:16.800
Yeah, I mean, I think if you get desperate enough

23:16.800 --> 23:18.520
by the end of the year, sometime in early December,

23:18.520 --> 23:20.880
you're going to buy a Chromebook and start hacking away on it.

23:20.880 --> 23:23.280
Well, funny enough is I thought for sure by this time last year

23:23.280 --> 23:25.320
I'd have a Chromebook, but it just never really quite

23:25.320 --> 23:25.840
came up.

23:25.840 --> 23:28.760
Joe ended up getting the Chromebook, so go figure.

23:28.760 --> 23:30.760
All right, Mr. Painter, are you ready to trot out

23:30.760 --> 23:31.600
another one of yours?

23:31.600 --> 23:34.360
We're going to do three each, so this is your second pick.

23:34.360 --> 23:36.480
I've enjoyed playing the game, but I'm

23:36.480 --> 23:40.280
not sure I've enjoyed playing around with Stadia with you.

23:40.280 --> 23:41.800
And unfortunately for this prediction,

23:41.800 --> 23:44.080
I think that by this time next year,

23:44.080 --> 23:45.920
Stadia will be on its way out.

23:45.920 --> 23:48.360
Sunset, maybe not totally offline,

23:48.360 --> 23:51.120
but plans announced that it's going to be discontinued.

23:51.120 --> 23:52.200
That fast, huh?

23:52.200 --> 23:53.680
Wow.

23:53.680 --> 23:56.960
I wondered if one of us would make a Stadia prediction.

23:56.960 --> 23:59.600
That was on my list of possible predictions,

23:59.600 --> 24:02.760
because it's so up in the air.

24:02.760 --> 24:04.760
And I think, Joe, you and I were spitballing

24:04.760 --> 24:07.520
possible predictions, and Stadia came up in that batch, too.

24:07.520 --> 24:09.480
Yeah, I think that if by the end of this year

24:09.480 --> 24:11.480
they do announce that it is going to go away,

24:11.480 --> 24:14.480
then they're going to have to also announce that people are

24:14.480 --> 24:16.080
going to get refunds for their games.

24:16.080 --> 24:18.040
Otherwise, people are going to be up in arms.

24:18.040 --> 24:20.380
It seems clear to me, and I don't have any insider info,

24:20.380 --> 24:23.180
but the game publishers must be setting these prices,

24:23.180 --> 24:24.600
because they're all over.

24:24.600 --> 24:29.480
As much as $99, $60, $40, they're all over the place.

24:29.480 --> 24:33.000
So it would, I think, be up to the game manufacturers

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
to do those refunds.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.120
And I think Google's going to just have to swallow it.

24:36.120 --> 24:37.840
I think that's too soon, Wes.

24:37.840 --> 24:40.440
Google like to have a long tail before they retire products.

24:40.440 --> 24:43.880
So unless it is a genuine disaster,

24:43.880 --> 24:45.360
I think you're premature.

24:45.360 --> 24:47.840
Although they are kind of transitioning to a kill

24:47.840 --> 24:50.760
fast and kill often culture, where something doesn't work,

24:50.760 --> 24:52.440
they pull the plug more and more.

24:52.440 --> 24:53.560
You know, knowing Google, I reckon

24:53.560 --> 24:55.480
they'll probably launch a competitor to Stadia.

24:55.480 --> 24:56.360
That's right there.

24:56.360 --> 24:58.680
You don't have to hear everything, at least, right?

24:58.680 --> 25:00.760
All right, I think you could lock that in, Wes.

25:00.760 --> 25:02.800
I think that's probably admissible, so go ahead.

25:02.800 --> 25:04.440
It doesn't make me happy to say, but I

25:04.440 --> 25:06.920
predict that by the end of 2020, Google

25:06.920 --> 25:10.960
will have announced the sunsetting of Stadia.

25:10.960 --> 25:14.960
The sunsetting, not necessarily the end, but like a timeline.

25:14.960 --> 25:16.840
Very good, very good, very good.

25:16.840 --> 25:19.600
All right, Mr. Cheesy, you got two more to pick from.

25:19.600 --> 25:20.600
I know you got a few.

25:20.600 --> 25:23.340
So what's your number two prediction for 2020?

25:23.340 --> 25:25.960
So my number two prediction for 2020

25:25.960 --> 25:29.840
is that most Linux desktop environments will have

25:29.840 --> 25:33.000
high DPI support out of the box.

25:33.000 --> 25:37.780
And a metric to measure that is that XFCE

25:37.780 --> 25:41.160
will have high DPI support in their next release

25:41.160 --> 25:42.160
out of the box.

25:42.160 --> 25:44.040
All right, because you could argue

25:44.040 --> 25:48.040
Gnome Shell, Plasma, and Pantheon do.

25:48.040 --> 25:49.080
Right.

25:49.080 --> 25:52.360
But you're right, there's still, what about things like LXQt?

25:52.360 --> 25:54.360
And because I know you can turn it on there, can't you,

25:54.360 --> 25:55.520
in LXQt?

25:55.520 --> 25:56.560
Here's the question, Cheesy.

25:56.560 --> 26:00.200
By default, do you mean that if I'm on a high DPI display,

26:00.200 --> 26:01.960
not only will it support high DPI,

26:01.960 --> 26:06.360
but it will actually be turned on or is just available?

26:06.360 --> 26:10.560
I will say that it would actually be turned on by default.

26:10.560 --> 26:13.360
The desktop environment will recognize

26:13.360 --> 26:15.560
that you're using a high DPI monitor

26:15.560 --> 26:18.040
and will switch into high DPI mode.

26:18.040 --> 26:19.120
Just works.

26:19.120 --> 26:20.280
That's risky.

26:20.280 --> 26:22.440
That's risky, although it's got a lot of hope

26:22.440 --> 26:23.400
in the Linux desktop.

26:23.400 --> 26:26.320
I have heard of a couple of different desktop projects

26:26.320 --> 26:29.840
that are working on that, and Pantheon already does it.

26:29.840 --> 26:30.840
Right.

26:30.840 --> 26:33.040
Proved it out.

26:33.040 --> 26:33.680
All right.

26:33.680 --> 26:34.960
What do you think, Judge?

26:34.960 --> 26:37.560
Well, I think that XFCE kind of has that already.

26:37.560 --> 26:41.880
It's not quite fully baked yet, but I think

26:41.880 --> 26:44.480
this is probably a dead cert.

26:44.480 --> 26:47.040
So lock it in if you want, but you're not

26:47.040 --> 26:49.040
going to get much credibility for saying it.

26:49.040 --> 26:54.280
The idea that XFCE will actually release in the next year.

26:54.280 --> 26:55.280
See, I think that's it.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.560
I think that's where Alex and I are at.

26:56.560 --> 26:58.240
It's possible that it's on their roadmap.

26:58.240 --> 26:59.360
They're getting close.

26:59.360 --> 27:01.600
That doesn't mean it's going to be shipping in a year.

27:01.600 --> 27:03.880
Yeah, but you've got GTK 3 already,

27:03.880 --> 27:07.400
and so with a point release, you could have this potentially.

27:07.400 --> 27:10.560
Not in an Ubuntu LTS or whatever, but in Arch certainly.

27:10.560 --> 27:13.880
I think it's still up in the air.

27:13.880 --> 27:17.160
I think he'd definitely nail it with Plasma, Gnome Shell,

27:17.160 --> 27:20.560
and a few of the others, especially the ones

27:20.560 --> 27:22.560
based on Qt.

27:22.560 --> 27:26.120
But when you throw XFCE in there, I don't know, man,

27:26.120 --> 27:28.080
because they've already got GTK 3 support

27:28.080 --> 27:30.880
and they haven't done it yet.

27:30.880 --> 27:33.320
I think that's anyone's game.

27:33.320 --> 27:34.560
I don't know, though.

27:34.560 --> 27:37.280
If you want them to make it more specific, you're the judge.

27:37.280 --> 27:42.800
Let me say that I believe that XFCE will have it enabled out

27:42.800 --> 27:45.720
of the box, and as we spoke to before,

27:45.720 --> 27:49.920
it will recognize your display and enable it

27:49.920 --> 27:52.360
if you do have a high DPI display.

27:52.360 --> 27:54.280
That's a big bar, too.

27:54.280 --> 27:56.840
All right, Cheezy, put it up in a nice sound bite

27:56.840 --> 27:57.880
and lock it in.

27:57.880 --> 28:04.280
All right, so I believe that Linux desktop environments,

28:04.280 --> 28:09.400
including XFCE, will have high DPI support out of the box

28:09.400 --> 28:13.640
and will enable a high DPI display by default

28:13.640 --> 28:17.000
if it's connected to your system.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.880
We have a brand new XPS 13 in-house for review right now.

28:20.880 --> 28:22.800
Wes and I have been testing it over the last few weeks.

28:22.800 --> 28:24.220
We'll have a review coming up soon,

28:24.220 --> 28:25.640
and it's got a high DPI display.

28:25.640 --> 28:26.720
It's so gorgeous.

28:26.720 --> 28:29.360
I always say that, but they really have just nailed it.

28:29.360 --> 28:30.360
Yeah, it's really nice.

28:30.360 --> 28:31.680
It really is great.

28:31.680 --> 28:35.000
OK, Mr. Ironic Badger, a couple more predictions

28:35.000 --> 28:36.640
available, these are your last two.

28:36.640 --> 28:38.080
What's your next one?

28:38.080 --> 28:42.120
My next one is about WireGuard, and specifically

28:42.120 --> 28:46.040
that because it's going to be included in kernel 5.6, which

28:46.040 --> 28:51.080
will miss the Ubuntu LTS release in April,

28:51.080 --> 28:53.320
that that release will find a way

28:53.320 --> 28:56.360
to ship with WireGuard baked into the kernel.

28:56.360 --> 28:59.000
I see there's a second part of this prediction, too,

28:59.000 --> 29:01.960
a slightly bolder aspect to this prediction.

29:01.960 --> 29:06.120
The second part is that PF Sense will ship WireGuard.

29:06.120 --> 29:07.880
Boy, that'd be great.

29:07.880 --> 29:10.840
That would be really great.

29:10.840 --> 29:11.600
I can see it.

29:11.600 --> 29:14.840
I mean, we're going to probably see it most certainly,

29:14.840 --> 29:17.080
but not for sure, mainline towards the beginning

29:17.080 --> 29:17.960
of the year.

29:17.960 --> 29:21.080
So it'll be in the main kernel, probably within Q1,

29:21.080 --> 29:26.960
and then maybe Q2, and then it'll be, I would imagine,

29:26.960 --> 29:29.040
getting baked into all kinds of things.

29:29.040 --> 29:31.440
So the specific prediction here, Alex, just so I've got it,

29:31.440 --> 29:36.720
is WireGuard will find its way into 2004,

29:36.720 --> 29:38.960
even if it misses the kernel window,

29:38.960 --> 29:40.560
and PF Sense will ship WireGuard.

29:40.560 --> 29:42.500
So you're saying two specific products

29:42.500 --> 29:44.200
will ship WireGuard in 2020.

29:44.200 --> 29:47.480
Yes, and specifically, I think what I mean with 2004

29:47.480 --> 29:50.320
is that it won't be a DKMS module.

29:50.320 --> 29:52.640
Right, but are you saying it'll be before the point release,

29:52.640 --> 29:54.680
before 2004.1?

29:54.680 --> 29:56.080
I'm hoping.

29:56.080 --> 29:56.920
I'm hoping here.

29:56.920 --> 30:01.120
You know, reading Jim's article about it on Ars Technica

30:01.120 --> 30:05.200
the other day, the developer for WireGuard

30:05.200 --> 30:07.120
has offered to do a bunch of work with Canonical

30:07.120 --> 30:11.320
to get it into the LTS release before the kernel ships.

30:11.320 --> 30:15.000
All right, why don't you sum it up and log it in.

30:15.000 --> 30:20.560
So I predict that Ubuntu LTS 2004 will ship with WireGuard,

30:20.560 --> 30:22.920
not as a DKMS module.

30:22.920 --> 30:26.400
And also, as a second half prediction,

30:26.400 --> 30:31.040
that PF Sense will ship with WireGuard.

30:31.040 --> 30:32.080
I hope that happens.

30:32.080 --> 30:33.960
Oh, I hope that happens.

30:33.960 --> 30:36.240
Brent, have you been inspired with a second prediction

30:36.240 --> 30:37.160
by this time?

30:37.160 --> 30:42.280
Well, I thought of one that touches on my hopes that

30:42.280 --> 30:44.200
came up last year in January.

30:44.200 --> 30:45.520
We had a hopes episode.

30:45.520 --> 30:48.320
And so I'm going to, unfortunately, it didn't happen.

30:48.320 --> 30:50.560
So I'm going to throw it out there for this year.

30:50.560 --> 30:57.400
I predict that Dell this year will make available

30:57.400 --> 31:02.840
a main Linux distribution on either, as a standard option,

31:02.840 --> 31:06.160
on either their XPS or Precision line

31:06.160 --> 31:07.520
on their website in the US.

31:07.520 --> 31:09.080
They go pop OS style.

31:09.080 --> 31:11.240
Yep, but they're not baking it themselves.

31:11.240 --> 31:13.320
So not a developer edition, you mean?

31:13.320 --> 31:14.800
Not a developer edition.

31:14.800 --> 31:19.520
I mean, you can go to Dell.com, click on the Precision button,

31:19.520 --> 31:21.160
and it's an option.

31:21.160 --> 31:22.360
Oh, I see.

31:22.360 --> 31:23.280
I thought you meant they're going

31:23.280 --> 31:24.880
to make their own Linux distro.

31:24.880 --> 31:25.760
No, sorry.

31:25.760 --> 31:27.140
That's way too crazy.

31:27.140 --> 31:29.480
So they're going to open it up beyond just the developer

31:29.480 --> 31:31.760
focus in 2020 is what you're thinking.

31:31.760 --> 31:36.040
Linux will be kind of a configurable option

31:36.040 --> 31:39.000
when you purchase a laptop from Dell.com.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.600
You know, what's interesting, Brent,

31:40.600 --> 31:41.680
is I could riff on that a little bit

31:41.680 --> 31:43.200
because I had a rough prediction that

31:43.200 --> 31:44.400
didn't make it into the show.

31:44.400 --> 31:46.720
And that was, in 2020, Linux would

31:46.720 --> 31:48.880
become the bring your own OS of choice

31:48.880 --> 31:52.520
to workspaces for developers and DevOps and system

31:52.520 --> 31:55.720
administrators and people working on cloud native.

31:55.720 --> 31:58.920
And I think, much like the Mac revolution

31:58.920 --> 32:01.440
was really started by individual employees wanting

32:01.440 --> 32:03.400
to use their own iPhones or their own Macs,

32:03.400 --> 32:05.680
that's what really got Apple into the enterprise.

32:05.680 --> 32:07.840
I think that's the same trajectory over 2020

32:07.840 --> 32:09.160
that will accelerate for Linux.

32:09.160 --> 32:10.880
I just didn't have a refined.

32:10.880 --> 32:12.840
But what Brent's kind of on the other end of it,

32:12.840 --> 32:15.200
he's saying it's going to go into consumer space.

32:15.200 --> 32:16.920
It's perhaps bold.

32:16.920 --> 32:17.480
It is.

32:17.480 --> 32:18.120
It is.

32:18.120 --> 32:20.880
But I could see them also wanting to hedge their bets,

32:20.880 --> 32:21.940
potentially.

32:21.940 --> 32:25.000
Do you think you could sum it up into a lockable prediction?

32:25.000 --> 32:30.960
In 2020, Dell will make available on their US website,

32:30.960 --> 32:38.280
Dell.com, Linux as a configurable option

32:38.280 --> 32:42.360
on their standard either precision or XPS line

32:42.360 --> 32:44.880
of laptops.

32:44.880 --> 32:46.240
I love some of these.

32:46.240 --> 32:49.000
If even just a few of these kind of semi-hopeful predictions

32:49.000 --> 32:50.560
happen, that'd be great.

32:50.560 --> 32:53.760
OK, so for my next prediction, this is my last one.

32:53.760 --> 32:56.760
And I have three additional ones written down.

32:56.760 --> 32:58.840
And I need some help picking.

32:58.840 --> 33:00.560
So I'm going to throw out my three.

33:00.560 --> 33:03.220
And you guys tell me which one you think I should officially

33:03.220 --> 33:04.560
lock in, OK?

33:04.560 --> 33:07.720
Number one, I have noticed a plethora

33:07.720 --> 33:10.000
of projects cropping up attempting

33:10.000 --> 33:15.720
to solve synchronized network audio playback.

33:15.720 --> 33:20.520
And I've recently solved this problem myself in the RV.

33:20.520 --> 33:25.920
And holy snowballs, if it isn't actually just really great.

33:25.920 --> 33:29.100
And I could definitely see synchronized network audio

33:29.100 --> 33:32.680
becoming a table stakes kind of any serious open source

33:32.680 --> 33:34.720
media playback solution will have

33:34.720 --> 33:38.080
some sort of baked-in support for synchronized audio

33:38.080 --> 33:40.080
playback, whatever that might be.

33:40.080 --> 33:42.160
That was one of them.

33:42.160 --> 33:45.600
The other one was Home Assistant becomes the next free software

33:45.600 --> 33:46.480
is Kodi.

33:46.480 --> 33:47.720
How do you measure that?

33:47.720 --> 33:48.680
That's the trick, right?

33:48.680 --> 33:53.040
Devices become sold like Home Assistant boxes

33:53.040 --> 33:55.400
start getting sold, like Kodi boxes.

33:55.400 --> 33:57.240
So like pre-configured little setups?

33:57.240 --> 33:59.920
Maybe with like HASS.io and different crazy add-ons

33:59.920 --> 34:03.480
pre-installed, some of which may or may not be all that legit.

34:03.480 --> 34:05.180
But none of them let you stream piracy,

34:05.180 --> 34:07.080
so they're not going to be popular.

34:07.080 --> 34:08.080
Maybe.

34:08.080 --> 34:10.840
And then my third kind of pie in the sky,

34:10.840 --> 34:12.760
but could possibly totally happen,

34:12.760 --> 34:16.560
was a classic, Seuss gets sold again.

34:16.560 --> 34:19.600
That's always here.

34:19.600 --> 34:20.920
So those are my three synchronized.

34:20.920 --> 34:22.080
I guess your safest bet there.

34:22.080 --> 34:22.880
I know, right?

34:22.880 --> 34:24.040
It is.

34:24.040 --> 34:26.400
My three are synchronized network audio playback,

34:26.400 --> 34:28.800
Home Assistant goes the way of the Kodi box,

34:28.800 --> 34:29.920
or Seuss gets sold.

34:29.920 --> 34:32.680
Which do you think has the, like I need a win.

34:32.680 --> 34:36.000
I think Seuss, also it's the easiest one to sort of measure.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.600
I think the other two we have some work ahead of us

34:37.600 --> 34:38.520
if you choose.

34:38.520 --> 34:42.360
Well, OK, what if the synchronized network audio

34:42.360 --> 34:45.400
was measured by it coming to Kodi somehow?

34:45.400 --> 34:49.560
So Kodi media playback or Plex, some sort of.

34:49.560 --> 34:52.000
Home Assistant, how's it built in?

34:52.000 --> 34:53.960
I did not know that, really.

34:53.960 --> 34:54.720
Of course it does.

34:54.720 --> 34:56.920
I love it.

34:56.920 --> 34:59.200
Seuss sold obviously would be the easiest,

34:59.200 --> 35:02.040
but I actually don't know if it's as likely.

35:02.040 --> 35:03.560
I really don't anymore.

35:03.560 --> 35:05.120
But of course, I haven't understood

35:05.120 --> 35:07.060
why it's been sold the last couple of times.

35:07.060 --> 35:08.460
So what do I know?

35:08.460 --> 35:09.520
Maybe it will.

35:09.520 --> 35:12.320
It kind of depends on what stage of the market hype

35:12.320 --> 35:13.200
Kubernetes is in.

35:13.200 --> 35:16.920
And I think it's in kind of a cooling and consolidating stage

35:16.920 --> 35:17.400
now.

35:17.400 --> 35:19.120
Not that it's not being used, absolutely,

35:19.120 --> 35:21.600
but that it's just sort of maturing a little bit.

35:21.600 --> 35:24.160
And so putting Kubernetes is about as effective

35:24.160 --> 35:27.440
as putting blockchain in your name right now, I think.

35:27.440 --> 35:31.040
So I don't think Seuss has got a strong play that

35:31.040 --> 35:35.680
makes it super valuable, other than a really solid, great

35:35.680 --> 35:37.640
customer base with some important people

35:37.640 --> 35:39.800
in the industry, which is very valuable.

35:39.800 --> 35:43.320
But I don't think it's likely to sell yet.

35:43.320 --> 35:45.400
They probably want a nice return on them.

35:45.400 --> 35:46.240
I don't think they're there yet.

35:46.240 --> 35:48.200
I think they need to invest a little bit more

35:48.200 --> 35:49.360
for a little bit longer.

35:49.360 --> 35:51.100
So that leaves me with synchronized network

35:51.100 --> 35:53.360
audio or Home Assistant.

35:53.360 --> 35:55.120
We go on the way of the Cody box.

35:55.120 --> 35:59.240
I think the Home Assistant seems the most hopeful.

35:59.240 --> 36:02.000
That would really change the game for a lot of people.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.920
I know you've kind of hoped this happened for a while.

36:04.920 --> 36:07.280
So that's where my vote lays.

36:07.280 --> 36:10.000
So rather than making it about Home Assistant,

36:10.000 --> 36:13.120
maybe it should be about this news

36:13.120 --> 36:16.000
lately around competing smart home standards.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.600
There's consolidation in the market around Zigbee and Zed

36:19.600 --> 36:23.100
Wave and MQTT and all these different things

36:23.100 --> 36:26.280
that Apple and Google and whatever are releasing.

36:26.280 --> 36:28.520
There's consolidation in the home automation market

36:28.520 --> 36:29.920
or something like that.

36:29.920 --> 36:30.720
Sure.

36:30.720 --> 36:31.600
Sure.

36:31.600 --> 36:33.040
And Apple just announced that they're

36:33.040 --> 36:34.920
open sourcing part of the HomeKit development.

36:34.920 --> 36:35.520
Is that right?

36:35.520 --> 36:36.000
Yeah.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.880
So they're open sourcing aspects of HomeKit,

36:37.880 --> 36:40.400
which is mind blowing, because that's actually

36:40.400 --> 36:42.960
my favorite home automation standard so far,

36:42.960 --> 36:44.320
since it's all over the land.

36:44.320 --> 36:45.280
I was sad to see that.

36:45.280 --> 36:46.400
That was going to be my prediction.

36:46.400 --> 36:49.960
And then they went and did it in 2019.

36:49.960 --> 36:52.040
So the thing about Home Assistant

36:52.040 --> 36:55.080
is it solves a problem that has a lot of momentum already

36:55.080 --> 36:56.400
in the marketplace.

36:56.400 --> 36:58.400
So even with all of these open standards, which

36:58.400 --> 37:02.000
will probably make things, if at all best case,

37:02.000 --> 37:05.160
better in the future, today people

37:05.160 --> 37:08.240
have bought a bunch of crazy different little devices

37:08.240 --> 37:12.480
on their Wi-Fi network, or they might have older Z Wave devices.

37:12.480 --> 37:15.400
And Home Assistant is just honey badger.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.040
It brings it all together.

37:17.040 --> 37:20.160
You can have a proprietary TP-Link adapter.

37:20.160 --> 37:23.520
You can have a GE Z Wave adapter.

37:23.520 --> 37:26.080
You can have a HomeKit device.

37:26.080 --> 37:27.160
It just doesn't care.

37:27.160 --> 37:28.320
It brings it all together.

37:28.320 --> 37:31.920
It reads the smart electric meter on the side of my house.

37:31.920 --> 37:33.880
It plugs in with literally everything.

37:33.880 --> 37:36.920
Sort of like how Kodi just will play any file.

37:36.920 --> 37:38.760
It'll play it over NFS, Samba.

37:38.760 --> 37:41.080
You can do a Plex add-in.

37:41.080 --> 37:43.120
It's that same kind of flexibility

37:43.120 --> 37:46.560
that makes it attractive to third party installers

37:46.560 --> 37:49.340
to make it a product.

37:49.340 --> 37:51.160
I've honestly fantasized about creating

37:51.160 --> 37:55.200
a business around a appliance Home Assistant kit.

37:55.200 --> 37:59.160
And I even made one for a family member as a gift,

37:59.160 --> 38:01.160
just because it's so simple with the Raspberry Pi.

38:01.160 --> 38:02.540
And I put in a little flirt case,

38:02.540 --> 38:04.280
and it looks like a legitimate product.

38:04.280 --> 38:06.400
So I think I want to go with the Home Assistant one.

38:06.400 --> 38:08.320
I'm talking myself into it.

38:08.320 --> 38:11.480
And I think the way I'll make it specific is there's

38:11.480 --> 38:15.840
going to be some box you can buy,

38:15.840 --> 38:17.960
either officially from the Home Assistant project

38:17.960 --> 38:21.800
or a third party that loads like Haas IO or Home Assistant.

38:21.800 --> 38:24.240
And you can buy that, and it's called like a Home Assistant

38:24.240 --> 38:25.280
box or something.

38:25.280 --> 38:26.240
I don't know what they'll call it.

38:26.240 --> 38:26.520
All right.

38:26.520 --> 38:28.080
I'll start selling those boxes, so you

38:28.080 --> 38:30.720
can slip me a tenner later.

38:30.720 --> 38:31.720
What do you think, Judge?

38:31.720 --> 38:32.720
Is that admissible?

38:32.720 --> 38:33.720
Yeah, I'd say so.

38:33.720 --> 38:34.520
All right.

38:34.520 --> 38:37.800
In 2020, we will see the introduction

38:37.800 --> 38:40.320
of a Home Assistant box, either by the project directly

38:40.320 --> 38:44.640
or a third party bundler that creates a Home Assistant

38:44.640 --> 38:46.840
appliance.

38:46.840 --> 38:47.680
Nicely done.

38:47.680 --> 38:48.520
I think that should happen.

38:48.520 --> 38:50.600
Somebody should take that idea and run with it.

38:50.600 --> 38:52.880
No chance.

38:52.880 --> 38:54.920
Thanks for the optimism.

38:54.920 --> 38:55.920
All right, Wes.

38:55.920 --> 38:57.600
I think people underestimate this project.

38:57.600 --> 38:58.760
It's so great.

38:58.760 --> 39:01.760
OK, Wes, it's your last prediction for 2020.

39:01.760 --> 39:02.800
What do you got for us?

39:02.800 --> 39:04.920
Well, I'm trying to decide if I should, you know.

39:04.920 --> 39:06.840
Do I want to play it safe here and try to get something

39:06.840 --> 39:08.600
I think I might have a reasonable chance of?

39:08.600 --> 39:09.320
Get a solid win.

39:09.320 --> 39:09.820
Right.

39:09.820 --> 39:11.840
Or do I just, you know, keep on having fun?

39:11.840 --> 39:12.120
I know.

39:12.120 --> 39:14.360
It is a lot of fun to just kind of go for the pie in the sky.

39:14.360 --> 39:16.200
But I think I'd like to be consistent here.

39:16.200 --> 39:18.120
And I'm just going to take one from last year's.

39:18.120 --> 39:20.760
I think BcashFS actually makes it this year.

39:20.760 --> 39:21.640
Into the mainline tree.

39:21.640 --> 39:22.960
You know, Linus pulls it in.

39:22.960 --> 39:24.960
I don't know if it'll actually make it out in time

39:24.960 --> 39:28.480
to make it to a distro ship or a kernel ship by Ubuntu or so.

39:28.480 --> 39:30.320
But it'll be in the main kernel tree.

39:30.320 --> 39:31.200
Yeah.

39:31.200 --> 39:33.240
I'd love to see that.

39:33.240 --> 39:35.840
I think that would be fantastic for those of us that

39:35.840 --> 39:39.680
have MVNE drives.

39:39.680 --> 39:41.160
NVME.

39:41.160 --> 39:43.320
NVME.

39:43.320 --> 39:45.080
Am I doing it on purpose now?

39:45.080 --> 39:46.560
All right.

39:46.560 --> 39:47.560
What do you think, Judge?

39:47.560 --> 39:49.360
Is that admissible?

39:49.360 --> 39:50.280
Yeah, I'd say so.

39:50.280 --> 39:52.240
All right, Mr. West, lock it in then.

39:52.240 --> 39:55.920
I predict that in 2020, BcashFS makes it

39:55.920 --> 39:59.240
into the Linux kernel mainline.

39:59.240 --> 40:00.440
I hope that's a slam dunk.

40:00.440 --> 40:01.160
Fingers crossed.

40:01.160 --> 40:03.160
Now, Cheesy, there's a couple left on your list.

40:03.160 --> 40:06.200
Which one do you want to pick as your final 2020 prediction, sir?

40:06.200 --> 40:07.920
Well, I'm going to be that guy.

40:07.920 --> 40:09.000
I'm going to pick two.

40:09.000 --> 40:12.240
One is I don't believe that Chris will learn

40:12.240 --> 40:16.400
how to pronounce NVME in 2020.

40:16.400 --> 40:18.680
But since I'm not going to win any of these,

40:18.680 --> 40:21.120
and since none of these are going to work out in my favor,

40:21.120 --> 40:22.920
I'm just going to go with the pie in the sky here.

40:22.920 --> 40:25.480
And I'm going to say that Amazon or Google

40:25.480 --> 40:32.080
will launch a consumer-based robot assistant akin to Butler

40:32.080 --> 40:36.600
or something a little more than a robot vacuum cleaner.

40:36.600 --> 40:39.600
But I think that one of the big players

40:39.600 --> 40:44.240
will launch a consumer-based robot assistant.

40:44.240 --> 40:46.560
I was thinking of that exact sound effect, Chris.

40:46.560 --> 40:48.640
Yep, it's Rosie the robot.

40:48.640 --> 40:50.760
You know, that'd be semi-compelling.

40:50.760 --> 40:55.960
There was a third party assistant robot.

40:55.960 --> 41:00.560
And ironically, there is a really sad documentary

41:00.560 --> 41:02.960
on YouTube about the life of this robot.

41:02.960 --> 41:06.240
It entered into families' homes.

41:06.240 --> 41:08.920
And then the cloud service that powered the robot

41:08.920 --> 41:12.360
was shut down in this weird, awkward way

41:12.360 --> 41:15.840
in such that the robot slowly died and lost

41:15.840 --> 41:17.360
certain functionality.

41:17.360 --> 41:18.520
That's so sad.

41:18.520 --> 41:20.440
So the documentary covers families

41:20.440 --> 41:22.360
that are experiencing the degradation

41:22.360 --> 41:24.560
of their little friendly robot.

41:24.560 --> 41:27.360
It's really something.

41:27.360 --> 41:29.480
But it has been done.

41:29.480 --> 41:30.280
It had a screen.

41:30.280 --> 41:31.000
It had eyes.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.160
It could follow you around.

41:32.160 --> 41:35.320
It could roll around like a little R2 unit.

41:35.320 --> 41:37.320
So I could see it cheesy, especially

41:37.320 --> 41:39.120
with all of the investment that they have

41:39.120 --> 41:40.200
to put into something like this.

41:40.200 --> 41:41.280
Now, are you picturing something that's

41:41.280 --> 41:42.720
like Roomba-style mobile?

41:42.720 --> 41:44.040
Or is it in one room?

41:44.040 --> 41:45.560
Is it walking?

41:45.560 --> 41:48.800
Is it more like an R2 robot style?

41:48.800 --> 41:50.360
Give me a mental image.

41:50.360 --> 41:52.440
So I don't think it will be bipedal.

41:52.440 --> 41:54.440
I don't think it will be walking around.

41:54.440 --> 41:58.680
I think it will have some sort of a motor system and wheels.

41:58.680 --> 42:02.760
But I do believe that it will be able to go from room to room

42:02.760 --> 42:05.120
and assist you in different ways.

42:05.120 --> 42:08.400
Tank, set a timer.

42:08.400 --> 42:11.400
More than just a specialized kind of robot,

42:11.400 --> 42:14.480
but something that can actually assist you in the home.

42:14.480 --> 42:16.600
Have you seen the Boston Dynamics robot

42:16.600 --> 42:18.440
that can do parkour now?

42:18.440 --> 42:18.920
I have.

42:18.920 --> 42:19.720
I have.

42:19.720 --> 42:20.680
This is so freaky.

42:20.680 --> 42:22.680
And not like one of these 70s robots

42:22.680 --> 42:24.560
where they actually just put a little person

42:24.560 --> 42:25.800
inside of the robot.

42:25.800 --> 42:27.800
It just rolls in on its little tank treads

42:27.800 --> 42:29.920
while your family's sleeping and murders everyone

42:29.920 --> 42:30.560
in their sleep.

42:30.560 --> 42:31.520
No, I got you.

42:31.520 --> 42:33.200
Well, that's only if you tell it to.

42:33.200 --> 42:36.200
Guys, I've just put into the chat a little YouTube video

42:36.200 --> 42:38.560
to show you what is possible with high-end robotics

42:38.560 --> 42:39.040
these days.

42:39.040 --> 42:40.280
It's incredible.

42:40.280 --> 42:41.040
Boston Dynamics.

42:41.040 --> 42:42.160
Yeah, it's pretty freaky.

42:42.160 --> 42:44.400
So as long as you don't install the murder skill, though,

42:44.400 --> 42:45.040
right, Cheese?

42:45.040 --> 42:45.800
That's right.

42:45.800 --> 42:47.840
Yeah, the murder container, I think, is what it would be called.

42:47.840 --> 42:49.800
All right, so Judge, what do you need from this

42:49.800 --> 42:51.760
to make this a lockable prediction?

42:51.760 --> 42:52.800
I need specifics.

42:52.800 --> 42:53.360
I don't know.

42:53.360 --> 42:55.040
There's a lot being said there.

42:55.040 --> 42:57.840
How can you boil that down to be something specific?

42:57.840 --> 43:01.160
There's a very, very scary future

43:01.160 --> 43:04.640
that Cheese could possibly be predicting here.

43:04.640 --> 43:06.320
It's listening, and it follows you around

43:06.320 --> 43:07.520
so it can capture everything.

43:07.520 --> 43:10.760
And there's no way it runs open source.

43:10.760 --> 43:12.840
What do you think, Cheesy?

43:12.840 --> 43:14.080
Can you nail it down a little bit?

43:14.080 --> 43:16.080
Give us a couple of specifics we can sink our teeth into.

43:16.080 --> 43:17.880
Maybe ask your robot to nail it down.

43:17.880 --> 43:19.280
I don't feel like it's that crazy,

43:19.280 --> 43:22.000
because they would get even more data into their systems

43:22.000 --> 43:23.460
if they're watching you all the time.

43:23.460 --> 43:25.640
So could happen.

43:25.640 --> 43:29.480
I would say, more specifically, that Amazon or Google

43:29.480 --> 43:32.480
will launch a consumer-based robot that

43:32.480 --> 43:37.640
is mobile in your home to assist you with various tasks,

43:37.640 --> 43:42.960
including getting you a beer from the refrigerator.

43:42.960 --> 43:45.880
OK, Alex, it's your last prediction for 2020.

43:45.880 --> 43:48.440
What do you want to throw into the pile?

43:48.440 --> 43:50.480
I predict that Brent will never switch laptops.

43:50.480 --> 43:50.960
Hey, now.

43:50.960 --> 43:52.800
That's a nice and easy one, Judge.

43:52.800 --> 43:54.840
I mean, how long ago did you buy that thing, Pat?

43:54.840 --> 43:55.560
Over a month?

43:55.560 --> 43:56.800
How have you not switched yet?

43:56.800 --> 43:59.240
Come on, but you've got Linux Fest Northwest to think of.

43:59.240 --> 44:01.080
If nothing else, it'll happen at Linux Fest.

44:01.080 --> 44:02.600
All right, let's do a real one.

44:02.600 --> 44:03.680
OK.

44:03.680 --> 44:05.440
I predict that Plex will continue

44:05.440 --> 44:07.280
to alienate their core user base.

44:07.280 --> 44:10.760
And as a result, one of the open source replacements,

44:10.760 --> 44:14.760
such as MB, Jellyfin, or Olaris, will

44:14.760 --> 44:17.560
become a viable alternative by shipping apps

44:17.560 --> 44:22.920
on a major platform, such as Roku, Android TV, or Apple TV.

44:22.920 --> 44:26.060
Seems like Roku should be pretty doable for Jellyfin or MB.

44:26.060 --> 44:27.720
As well as Apple TV, you just got to get it

44:27.720 --> 44:29.440
in the iOS app store, which you'd probably want to get it

44:29.440 --> 44:30.880
on iPads and phones, too.

44:30.880 --> 44:33.480
Well, I mean, Plex is already available for the Roku, so.

44:33.480 --> 44:35.980
This feels like two different predictions to me.

44:35.980 --> 44:38.280
This feels like prediction number one

44:38.280 --> 44:41.960
is that Plex alienates core users by doing more things

44:41.960 --> 44:43.040
people don't like.

44:43.040 --> 44:46.880
And prediction number two is that MB or Jellyfin

44:46.880 --> 44:49.160
end up on a commercial device.

44:49.160 --> 44:52.280
But the selection that Plex have in their latest free movies

44:52.280 --> 44:57.080
thing, their leading movie poster was The Terminator.

44:57.080 --> 44:59.640
I mean, what does that tell you?

44:59.640 --> 45:01.200
It tells me that's a great movie.

45:01.200 --> 45:01.680
I'm in.

45:01.680 --> 45:03.120
Retro goodness, yeah.

45:03.120 --> 45:05.000
OK, one good movie.

45:05.000 --> 45:06.320
I actually did watch one.

45:06.320 --> 45:08.120
I did watch one just, and it wasn't that bad.

45:08.120 --> 45:11.200
It was some old cheesy sci-fi movie.

45:11.200 --> 45:13.600
I totally think this is possible because Plex is

45:13.600 --> 45:15.680
in a absolutely impossible position.

45:15.680 --> 45:18.560
And that is they are number one with a bullet

45:18.560 --> 45:22.840
in enabling streaming piracy from your own hard drives.

45:22.840 --> 45:25.480
But they make it really easy to not pay for any

45:25.480 --> 45:27.360
of these new streaming services.

45:27.360 --> 45:32.800
And there's Disney+, and Apple, and NBC, and HBO.

45:32.800 --> 45:34.360
And of course, all of the ones that

45:34.360 --> 45:37.600
have been around forever start to really get

45:37.600 --> 45:38.760
serious about streaming.

45:38.760 --> 45:40.640
They're going to look at the tools that

45:40.640 --> 45:43.520
enable people to steal.

45:43.520 --> 45:45.440
Just like the Cody boxes were targets,

45:45.440 --> 45:48.640
I kind of wonder if Plex as an organization

45:48.640 --> 45:50.400
won't become a target.

45:50.400 --> 45:52.120
And what is their business model?

45:52.120 --> 45:55.080
At the moment, it's selling Plex Pass,

45:55.080 --> 45:57.440
which is $5 a month, I think.

45:57.440 --> 46:01.320
Or sometimes it's on sale for $90 lifetime.

46:01.320 --> 46:05.040
And what is the core feature of Plex Pass?

46:05.040 --> 46:06.120
Offline sync.

46:06.120 --> 46:08.120
Offline sync, and there's also some streaming.

46:08.120 --> 46:09.800
Easier access to all your pirated stuff.

46:09.800 --> 46:11.040
Yeah, it just makes it easier.

46:11.040 --> 46:14.400
And it's also very easy to stream and play Plex content

46:14.400 --> 46:15.520
from other people's servers.

46:15.520 --> 46:17.840
So you don't even have to do the pirating yourself.

46:17.840 --> 46:19.440
You can just have a network of friends

46:19.440 --> 46:22.200
that have done the pirating and use Plex to watch it.

46:22.200 --> 46:27.480
So I could see them, because of the optics of this,

46:27.480 --> 46:29.080
having to just launch more and more

46:29.080 --> 46:32.320
into sort of commercial, legitimate streaming services

46:32.320 --> 46:34.600
to make Plex from the outside look

46:34.600 --> 46:39.440
like a brand that's based around streaming internet content.

46:39.440 --> 46:42.240
Because if you look at this year, they've added Tidal.

46:42.240 --> 46:43.600
They've added podcasts.

46:43.600 --> 46:47.200
They've added the free movie streaming thing.

46:47.200 --> 46:49.920
None of those things are things I want from a server that's

46:49.920 --> 46:52.600
playing media that's stored locally for me.

46:52.600 --> 46:56.000
Yeah, that's why I really do think this is Jellyfin's gain

46:56.000 --> 47:02.560
to have here, other than its UI is atrocious, just like MB's.

47:02.560 --> 47:04.400
And that's where Olaris comes in for me.

47:04.400 --> 47:06.080
That thing is beautiful.

47:06.080 --> 47:09.680
Yes, but really, starting all over again

47:09.680 --> 47:12.600
in a brand new product when Plex is getting

47:12.600 --> 47:14.360
mature and feature rich, and you've

47:14.360 --> 47:17.480
invested all of your time in organizing your library,

47:17.480 --> 47:18.520
that's a tough sell.

47:18.520 --> 47:20.280
It's hard, but then again, these guys

47:20.280 --> 47:22.080
making these open source alternatives

47:22.080 --> 47:25.400
know that Plex is a captive market to aim at.

47:25.400 --> 47:28.760
And so they can write tools to pull out

47:28.760 --> 47:30.640
the metadata from your Plex library

47:30.640 --> 47:32.920
so that watch status and that kind of thing

47:32.920 --> 47:35.040
just comes over no problem.

47:35.040 --> 47:36.440
Not everyone cares about that.

47:36.440 --> 47:37.560
I don't care about that at all.

47:37.560 --> 47:38.560
Yeah, if you're starting from.

47:38.560 --> 47:39.920
I move them back and forth all the time.

47:39.920 --> 47:42.180
Yeah, if you're starting from a very small batch or from

47:42.180 --> 47:43.960
scratch, it doesn't matter at all, I suppose.

47:43.960 --> 47:46.560
I think you're right, Alex, in that the real kind of tell

47:46.560 --> 47:48.800
would be if you could get this on a Roku or an Apple

47:48.800 --> 47:50.900
TV or an Android Google Play.

47:50.900 --> 47:52.560
So I think we've got to whittle this down

47:52.560 --> 47:55.120
to kind of a more specific prediction.

47:55.120 --> 47:56.040
And I fire you.

47:56.040 --> 47:58.000
I'd go for the Jellyfin or MB one,

47:58.000 --> 48:00.320
because I think that's really what you need to see,

48:00.320 --> 48:02.760
and then Plex will lay its own bet.

48:02.760 --> 48:08.280
All right, so I predict that MB or Jellyfin or Olaris

48:08.280 --> 48:10.640
will become a viable alternative to Plex

48:10.640 --> 48:15.280
by shipping apps on one of the major platforms,

48:15.280 --> 48:19.920
such as Roku, Android TV, or Apple TV.

48:19.920 --> 48:20.840
That's solid.

48:20.840 --> 48:21.960
Nice.

48:21.960 --> 48:23.360
That's another one I'd really like

48:23.360 --> 48:26.840
to see, because that's really what it would take for me.

48:26.840 --> 48:30.520
Import my library metadata, make a great streaming application,

48:30.520 --> 48:32.960
have it support auto bit rate adjustment,

48:32.960 --> 48:34.280
and let me have at it.

48:34.280 --> 48:35.840
I think that'd be pretty good.

48:35.840 --> 48:38.360
Brent, you don't happen to have one third last prediction

48:38.360 --> 48:39.200
for 2020, do you?

48:39.200 --> 48:40.860
Could always steal one you like from the doc

48:40.860 --> 48:41.480
that hasn't been used.

48:41.480 --> 48:42.240
That's true.

48:42.240 --> 48:42.740
That's true.

48:42.740 --> 48:44.400
Drew has a couple of good ones in there.

48:44.400 --> 48:46.360
He wasn't able to make it, but you could

48:46.360 --> 48:47.600
pick one of Drew's in there.

48:47.600 --> 48:50.960
Well, OK, I'm going to crowdsource this one then,

48:50.960 --> 48:55.200
since I'm delinquent and don't have the doc in front of me.

48:55.200 --> 48:59.000
Can we go through Drew's and decide collectively

48:59.000 --> 49:00.600
which one I should go for?

49:00.600 --> 49:02.260
All right, a major hardware vulnerability

49:02.260 --> 49:05.160
near the scale of Spectre is found in ARM.

49:05.160 --> 49:06.040
Oh, good one.

49:06.040 --> 49:07.800
AMD continues to gain against Intel,

49:07.800 --> 49:10.720
surging to more than 50% market share for the year.

49:10.720 --> 49:11.400
Ooh.

49:11.400 --> 49:13.400
So that's just probably, he means probably the year sales.

49:13.400 --> 49:14.480
That seems possible.

49:14.480 --> 49:17.720
And finally, a major voice assistant, Alexa, Google,

49:17.720 --> 49:20.080
Cortana, or Bixby, it's his list,

49:20.080 --> 49:23.400
has an exploit seen, quote, in the wild.

49:23.400 --> 49:24.920
Ooh.

49:24.920 --> 49:26.600
Define exploit.

49:26.600 --> 49:29.640
I think something, hmm, yeah, what does that?

49:29.640 --> 49:30.900
Probably eavesdropping, right?

49:30.900 --> 49:32.320
That would be the ultimate exploit,

49:32.320 --> 49:34.200
is to enable third party eavesdropping.

49:34.200 --> 49:36.240
Isn't that what they're built for?

49:36.240 --> 49:38.920
Right, because is this like an exploit on the device locally,

49:38.920 --> 49:41.120
or is it like another exploit in the cloud service?

49:41.120 --> 49:42.000
Are those the same?

49:42.000 --> 49:42.960
I think one and the same.

49:42.960 --> 49:45.880
You could, I think, I read this as if you could enable

49:45.880 --> 49:48.760
this to do malicious actions, that's an exploit.

49:48.760 --> 49:51.360
So if you're taking advantage of the cloud service,

49:51.360 --> 49:54.000
or what would really be awful is if you get on the LAN,

49:54.000 --> 49:56.160
turn on the microphones, and not turn on the lights.

49:56.160 --> 49:57.600
Because a lot of these are wired in such

49:57.600 --> 50:00.360
that when the microphones are active, the lights turn on.

50:00.360 --> 50:02.000
So you'd have to be able to do it really in a way

50:02.000 --> 50:04.240
that really fooled the consumer.

50:04.240 --> 50:05.960
That's a tricky one to pull off, but doable.

50:05.960 --> 50:07.760
I imagine anything's possible.

50:07.760 --> 50:09.160
A major hardware vulnerability,

50:09.160 --> 50:10.840
that was his first one in ARM,

50:10.840 --> 50:12.640
like that's like Spectre class in ARM.

50:12.640 --> 50:14.160
That seems possible.

50:14.160 --> 50:16.040
You gotta imagine people are looking.

50:17.040 --> 50:17.880
They gotta be looking.

50:17.880 --> 50:21.320
And then number two, AMD gets a 50% sales in that year,

50:21.320 --> 50:23.120
in 2020.

50:23.120 --> 50:24.400
So Brand, out of that batch,

50:24.400 --> 50:26.400
you got AMD getting great sales for the year,

50:26.400 --> 50:27.880
you got a major vulnerability in ARM,

50:27.880 --> 50:31.760
and then you got perhaps an exploit of some type,

50:31.760 --> 50:34.240
quote unquote, in the wild, he adds,

50:34.240 --> 50:35.960
for one of the major voice assistants.

50:35.960 --> 50:38.160
Yeah, it touches on like data breach stuff.

50:38.160 --> 50:39.360
I kind of like that topic.

50:39.360 --> 50:41.120
So I think I'm gonna lean there.

50:41.120 --> 50:43.480
Do you wanna try to sum that up and lock it in?

50:43.480 --> 50:46.760
I believe in 2020,

50:46.760 --> 50:50.640
we will see one of the voice assistant platforms,

50:50.640 --> 50:52.640
one of the Pepsi or Cola,

50:52.640 --> 50:57.560
get a malicious exploit that is active in the wild.

50:59.120 --> 50:59.960
Nice.

50:59.960 --> 51:01.320
I like that we drafted one of Drew's.

51:01.320 --> 51:02.160
That was perfect.

51:02.160 --> 51:03.600
That was great.

51:03.600 --> 51:04.920
Well, there you have it.

51:04.920 --> 51:08.920
It's pretty much indisputable at this point.

51:08.920 --> 51:09.760
We've laid it down.

51:09.760 --> 51:10.840
There's no going back.

51:10.840 --> 51:12.520
And now all we have to do is wait a year

51:12.520 --> 51:14.720
to find out how bad we did.

51:14.720 --> 51:15.560
Wow.

51:15.560 --> 51:16.400
I hope it's a long year.

51:16.400 --> 51:19.560
I have a whole batch of audience submissions

51:19.560 --> 51:20.840
that I think we'll do in the post-show.

51:20.840 --> 51:22.520
So why don't we just take care of a couple items

51:22.520 --> 51:23.360
before we get out of here?

51:23.360 --> 51:24.200
How's that sound to you?

51:24.200 --> 51:25.040
Yeah, let's do it.

51:25.040 --> 51:28.000
You know, one thing that I would like to hear

51:28.000 --> 51:31.760
is if our judge for this glorious episode

51:31.760 --> 51:33.400
has a prediction for next year.

51:33.400 --> 51:34.760
That's the whole point of being the judge.

51:34.760 --> 51:36.280
I don't have to make any predictions.

51:36.280 --> 51:40.840
Well, well played, sir, well played.

51:40.840 --> 51:42.120
He's going to do it in land for sure.

51:42.120 --> 51:44.640
Do you have any that you've saved, Joe?

51:44.640 --> 51:46.960
Any crazy ones that you don't actually

51:46.960 --> 51:48.280
care if I write it wrong?

51:48.280 --> 51:50.240
All right, well, I'll give you an absolutely crazy one.

51:50.240 --> 51:52.400
Chrome OS will add ZFS support.

51:52.400 --> 51:53.240
Wow.

51:53.240 --> 51:54.400
Nice.

51:54.400 --> 51:56.400
That's exactly the kind I was thinking of.

51:56.400 --> 51:57.600
Very nice, sir.

51:57.600 --> 51:58.440
I love it.

51:58.440 --> 51:59.280
You know what? Go ahead.

51:59.280 --> 52:01.280
I'm going to lock that in.

52:01.280 --> 52:02.440
And that kind of brings us to an end.

52:02.440 --> 52:04.040
We're just about done here.

52:04.040 --> 52:05.160
No more holiday episodes.

52:05.160 --> 52:07.840
Go back to our regularly scheduled shenanigans.

52:07.840 --> 52:08.680
How do you feel about that?

52:08.680 --> 52:10.120
You ready to be live again, Wes?

52:10.120 --> 52:10.960
Oh, I'm excited.

52:10.960 --> 52:11.800
Get that virtual love going again.

52:11.800 --> 52:12.920
It's been a nice little break.

52:12.920 --> 52:13.760
Yeah, it has been nice.

52:13.760 --> 52:15.600
By now, we've been off for the longest time

52:15.600 --> 52:17.160
in the history of the show.

52:17.160 --> 52:20.200
We'll be coming back fresh or really hungover.

52:20.200 --> 52:21.040
I'm not sure which.

52:21.040 --> 52:21.960
Probably both.

52:21.960 --> 52:23.120
So I've got some more predictions

52:23.120 --> 52:24.480
that we'll get to in the post-show.

52:24.480 --> 52:26.120
So before we get to that,

52:26.120 --> 52:28.280
I'll just mention a little bit of business.

52:28.280 --> 52:30.400
Number one, you can find all of our live times

52:30.400 --> 52:32.560
at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

52:32.560 --> 52:34.560
You can join us live at jblive.tv.

52:34.560 --> 52:36.520
We do stream it on Twitch,

52:36.520 --> 52:38.200
which is one of our lower latency streams,

52:38.200 --> 52:40.440
twitch.tv slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

52:40.440 --> 52:44.080
And we have the JBLive FM stream up again.

52:44.080 --> 52:44.920
Audio only.

52:44.920 --> 52:46.120
Audio only if you're on the go.

52:46.120 --> 52:47.640
It's a great way to listen.

52:47.640 --> 52:48.480
But join us live.

52:48.480 --> 52:49.520
That Mamba Room's open.

52:49.520 --> 52:50.680
You can be part of the lug.

52:50.680 --> 52:52.640
You can get in that irc.geekshed.net

52:52.640 --> 52:54.640
Pound Jupiter Broadcasting chat room.

52:54.640 --> 52:56.640
We'll see you back here next Tuesday.

52:56.640 --> 53:06.640
We'll see you back here next Tuesday.

53:27.640 --> 53:30.640
Get it out of here.

53:30.640 --> 53:33.040
Well, I can promise we got a couple of listener predictions

53:33.040 --> 53:34.320
here for the post-show.

53:34.320 --> 53:36.200
This one came in from Tin Tin.

53:36.200 --> 53:38.480
Tin Tin predicts that Canonical will go public

53:38.480 --> 53:40.680
and Microsoft will buy a big chunk of the shares,

53:40.680 --> 53:42.640
one of the big initial investors.

53:42.640 --> 53:44.600
There was also a Hayati.

53:44.600 --> 53:45.480
I think that's how you say it.

53:45.480 --> 53:46.320
Probably not.

53:46.320 --> 53:48.520
Microsoft will buy Canonical.

53:48.520 --> 53:49.640
How about this one?

53:49.640 --> 53:54.640
Deep Grewal says Microsoft will put Windows

53:54.640 --> 53:57.240
as a official Linux distro by swapping out the base

53:57.240 --> 53:59.440
with Linux and listing on distrowatch.com.

53:59.440 --> 54:00.440
Wouldn't that be the day?

54:00.440 --> 54:01.280
Never gonna happen.

54:01.280 --> 54:02.880
KDE and GNOME will produce

54:02.880 --> 54:05.200
a unified compatible desktop environment.

54:05.200 --> 54:07.040
That seems almost less likely than the Windows.

54:07.040 --> 54:09.760
That's what Nashem says, I know.

54:09.760 --> 54:12.320
Byte Bitten says that Intel will introduce

54:12.320 --> 54:14.640
a legitimate ARM competitor.

54:14.640 --> 54:15.480
Don't know how they're gonna get it,

54:15.480 --> 54:16.680
but they're gonna get there.

54:16.680 --> 54:19.440
Also, Byte predicts that Photoshop for Linux

54:19.440 --> 54:22.200
will ship likely a stripped down version of Photoshop,

54:22.200 --> 54:24.160
could be an Electron application.

54:24.160 --> 54:26.880
Hey, the Adobe suite is never coming to Linux,

54:26.880 --> 54:28.240
I can assure you.

54:28.240 --> 54:29.640
Well, I mean, I thought that too,

54:29.640 --> 54:31.000
but then they made it for the iPad.

54:31.000 --> 54:35.360
I'm thinking to myself, are there more desktop Linux users

54:35.360 --> 54:36.280
than iPad users?

54:36.280 --> 54:37.120
Maybe.

54:37.120 --> 54:39.440
But Apple cut them a fat check for that.

54:39.440 --> 54:41.040
Wasn't there a survey a while ago

54:41.040 --> 54:43.600
that went out asking this kind of stuff?

54:43.600 --> 54:44.680
Was that two years ago?

54:44.680 --> 54:45.680
It's never gonna happen.

54:45.680 --> 54:47.720
Hey, but Byte says it's gonna happen.

54:47.720 --> 54:48.880
We put it on there.

54:48.880 --> 54:50.680
Nick at the Linux experiment on Twitter says

54:50.680 --> 54:52.680
that he thinks that Microsoft will bring

54:52.680 --> 54:56.640
another Office application over to GNU slash Linux.

54:56.640 --> 55:00.000
And here's one that I put in LAN.

55:00.000 --> 55:03.160
He says that Nvidia will open source their drivers

55:03.160 --> 55:05.320
and start contributing to Nuvoo directly.

55:05.320 --> 55:06.360
Nuvoo.

55:06.360 --> 55:26.360
Never gonna happen, Joe.
