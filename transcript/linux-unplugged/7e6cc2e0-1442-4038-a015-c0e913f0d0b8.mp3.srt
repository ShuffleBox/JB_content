1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I watched Mad Dog's 50 Years of Unix and Linux Advances talk.

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:06,280
It's great, wasn't it?

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,440
That room was so full, it was standing room only.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,300
Yeah, that looked like it was a good talk.

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,360
And he made a great point

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,120
that if we're gonna call it GNU slash Linux,

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,320
we should probably also call it GNU slash Linux,

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,360
MIT slash Linux, BSD slash Linux,

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,280
insert license here because it's all,

10
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,640
the user land now is full of so many different licenses

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,320
that it might be time to update that whole naming thing.

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,040
I think I called that a couple of years ago,

13
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,960
isn't it system D slash Linux now?

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,680
This is Linux Unplugged episode 287 for February 5th, 2019.

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,840
Oh, hi there and welcome to Linux Unplugged,

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,480
your weekly Linux talk show

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,960
that's hunkered down in a windstorm.

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,800
My name is Chris.

19
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,920
My name is Wes.

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,040
And Wes, you're hunkered down in a snowstorm,

21
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,880
but that's not what we're here to talk about today.

22
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,060
No, no, we have some community news,

23
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,200
including everyone's favorite media player

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,560
getting a major update and everyone's favorite desktop.

25
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,480
Well, at least that's what the stats would tell us.

26
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,000
Gnome Shell is getting a major speed boost.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,520
We'll talk a little about open source cryptocurrency crashes,

28
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,560
some big updates in housekeeping,

29
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,540
and then a FOSDEM check-in.

30
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,560
Not only do we have a couple of choice moments from FOSDEM,

31
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,480
but the one and only good smelling Popey joins us.

32
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,280
There's nobody else that smells as good as Popey does.

33
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,960
And he joins us this week to talk about FOSDEM,

34
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,920
maybe his lightning talk and other observations.

35
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,440
In fact, we've got a mumble room full of people,

36
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,020
so we'll see, perhaps they have some experiences as well.

37
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,880
But later on in the show,

38
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,120
something Wes and I've been wanting to do

39
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,560
for a good long while now,

40
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,440
but we've never really had the opportunity,

41
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,280
just never really came up in the cycle of things

42
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,680
until this week.

43
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,680
PiHole, everyone's favorite network-wide ad blocker,

44
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,600
has a big update, version 4.2 this week.

45
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,720
So we're gonna kick the tires,

46
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,320
give you a rundown of PiHole,

47
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,440
how it works, what makes it tick,

48
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,200
the open source projects it's using

49
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,140
to accomplish what it does,

50
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,640
and Wes's experiences giving it a go,

51
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,720
and how you can also install it

52
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,280
and other things besides the Raspberry Pi.

53
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,100
And then we'll wrap it all up

54
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,840
with another excellent pick, as we do.

55
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,480
But before we go any further,

56
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,940
you know what we gots to do.

57
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,840
We gotta bring in that virtual lug time.

58
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,160
Appropriate greetings.

59
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,000
Hello.

60
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,240
We have quite the show today,

61
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,000
so it's appropriate that we have quite the showing.

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We have Brent, Bruce, Cubicle Nate,

63
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,720
Dan Rabbit, Foursquare,

64
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,960
Popey, Sean, Skull, TechMav,

65
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,680
ThisGeekTweets, William on his iPhone XS Max,

66
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,560
and Mr. Martin Wimpress,

67
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,800
all joining us in our virtual lug today.

68
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,000
We have the first study group after the show today,

69
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,280
so stick around, guys, and learn some YAML.

70
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,180
I think it's gonna be a great episode.

71
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,500
Yeah, first you get to goof off with us here on Unplugged,

72
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,120
and then we can get some serious studying done.

73
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,560
I think it's gonna be good.

74
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,400
I think it's gonna be good.

75
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,020
I really do, because we've gotten a lot of interest.

76
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,160
We set up a meetup.

77
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,920
We got people voting on topics.

78
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,920
I'm just gonna say I'm pretty excited, Wes.

79
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,220
Pretty, pretty excited.

80
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,080
Now, I'm in, I think it's like a desert, Palm Desert.

81
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,760
I'm in some desert area in California.

82
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,800
It's like, yeah, it's like Palm Desert.

83
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,560
And you are up at the studio

84
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,440
where we are both in very different weather conditions.

85
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,220
So if you hear a bunch of crazy sounds in my background,

86
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,440
it's not me like throwing things at the dog or wife.

87
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,320
It is a big windstorm,

88
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,400
like 40, 50, 65 mile per hour winds

89
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,720
that are coming at us in three different directions.

90
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,300
We're like in the center of this valley

91
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,960
where all this wind is being funneled in

92
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,900
from the polar vortex, and it's just, it's what it is.

93
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,780
It's gonna be in the background a little bit this week.

94
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,680
Not ideal podcasting weather.

95
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,280
It turns out that is a thing.

96
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,720
Yeah, but I mean, thankfully,

97
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,880
now that Joe is our full-time editor,

98
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,840
anything that sounds weird, you can just blame on Joe.

99
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,680
It's not my fault.

100
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,840
You know, it's not my fault.

101
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,320
He must've just missed it in the edit.

102
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,940
Fix everything in post.

103
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,560
How are you and how are the doggies holding up

104
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,920
in the snow there you have in the Pacific Northwest?

105
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,920
Oh, they're having a great time.

106
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,740
Actually, they really like the snow.

107
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,580
Do they love it?

108
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,080
We went on a big hike on Sunday,

109
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,800
and it was just as the snow was starting to hit.

110
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,180
So we left, trail was clear,

111
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,360
just a nice kind of soggy Pacific Northwest day

112
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,120
by the time we got back covered in snow.

113
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,780
Oh man, dogs playing in the snow, along with kids,

114
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,200
one of the most adorable things ever.

115
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,520
And they get so tired, right?

116
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,560
And then they just take naps later.

117
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,820
It's great, you can get some work done.

118
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,020
It's the best, it is the best.

119
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,240
All right, well, we gotta start the show out

120
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,760
with the breaking news this week.

121
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,440
This is CNN Breaking News.

122
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,460
That's right, right here on the show,

123
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,640
developing as we record,

124
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,900
the plus is being dropped from GTK.

125
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,740
What do you think of this, Wes?

126
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,660
Beg your first, what are you learning now, Wes,

127
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,920
while you're on the scene?

128
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,380
Well, there's kind of a gnarly little commit diff here,

129
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,280
mostly because you have to rebalance

130
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,600
all the careful equal signs

131
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,320
you've placed underneath the titles.

132
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,060
Yeah, yeah, this commit is great

133
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,160
because it's basically the same thing

134
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,760
that's always been there,

135
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,580
but it's just everything without the plus.

136
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,440
So they've removed the plus from everything

137
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,660
and it's a pretty huge commit.

138
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,480
And can I just be the first to say, congratulations?

139
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,720
Congratulations to the GTK team for making this move.

140
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,160
It is high time that the plus dies.

141
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,080
It goes away, it needs to be done.

142
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,320
I find it offensive, I find it revolting,

143
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,040
and I am happy to see it go.

144
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,280
I think this is a move for the user.

145
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,960
This is a move for usability.

146
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,440
And clearly now we should all switch

147
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,200
to Gnome and the GTK stack.

148
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,080
Your thoughts?

149
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,720
It's nice to see them taking things so seriously.

150
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,920
I actually do, I am somewhat serious about that though.

151
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,800
Like I do think it is a much more user-friendly facing look.

152
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,120
I know it's a weird thing to comment on,

153
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,560
but it makes it, when it's GTK+,

154
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,640
I don't know, it's just something about it.

155
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,840
It's a little more techy.

156
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,120
It's sort of like, what does the plus mean?

157
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,520
What's happening here?

158
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,640
GTK at least is some sort of just like

159
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,600
a normal three-letter acronym.

160
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,280
And our lives will never be the same.

161
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,080
Everything has changed.

162
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,600
The story continues to develop.

163
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,280
So you're pleased to see the plus go away from GTK, right?

164
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,120
Oh, I hated it.

165
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,760
I just thought, I was so bothered by the plus, you know?

166
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,320
Okay, what's your opinion on Pop OS?

167
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,720
Wait, is it, wait, the inter-capping,

168
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,200
the underscore or the exclamation mark, which part of it?

169
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,520
Sorry, I wasn't clear.

170
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,440
What's your opinion on Pop OS?

171
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,760
I just wish they'd change it to a dash

172
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,640
instead of an underscore, and then I'd be fine.

173
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,480
That's the thing.

174
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,480
You see, the underscore is part

175
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,120
of the overall brand strategy.

176
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,920
You see, the underscore is representative

177
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,160
of the System76 name,

178
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,360
and they like to have that underscore throughout.

179
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,400
So it's not going away.

180
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,360
It's not going away.

181
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,280
And I think my thoughts on that are clear, actually.

182
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,480
Now, there's everybody's favorite media player,

183
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,920
although I happen to love MPV,

184
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,440
but I did have love for many years for VLC.

185
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,080
Now it's like, we're still, we're still on good terms.

186
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,440
I still haven't installed on my machine,

187
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,120
but it's not my default media player.

188
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,600
Maybe that'll change, though.

189
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,880
If this is coming out of FOSDEM this week,

190
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,360
we'll be talking more about FOSDEM in a moment,

191
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,320
but the lead developer, Jean-Baptiste,

192
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,320
has announced some solid details around version 4.0,

193
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,720
which, among many things, will be sporting a new playlist,

194
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,760
redone user interfaces, a new video output architecture,

195
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,760
which supports VR.

196
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,600
Thank you.

197
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,160
I'm sure Wimpy's been waiting for that.

198
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,200
And the removal of some old platforms.

199
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,240
Oh, yeah, that includes stuff in there,

200
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,800
like 360 degree video,

201
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,560
which I'm sure you're all using 3D audio to go along,

202
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,760
support for the desktop VR head-mounted display,

203
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,440
so stuff like the HTC Vive and Oculus,

204
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,320
and just a whole bunch of stuff for various things,

205
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,080
like better HDR support.

206
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,920
Yeah.

207
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,960
I mean, that I actually kind of think is pretty great,

208
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,000
but probably the most user-facing change

209
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,360
is the new interface.

210
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,760
There will be GNOME and KDE adaptations of it,

211
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,040
but my understanding is this new user interface

212
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,320
is using QML, and it looks very clean.

213
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,160
It looks a lot, actually, like GNOME MPV in some regards.

214
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,520
It's got a transparent play bar down at the bottom.

215
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,000
The playlist looks different.

216
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,760
It's an overlay that you can see through it,

217
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,760
and along with all of the standard GTK and Qt versions,

218
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,640
they'll also make sure it works with client-side decorations,

219
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:44,640
server-side decorations, Wayland, and X11 as well.

220
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,200
So when you think about what it takes now

221
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,200
to be a full-class, full-fledged desktop Linux application,

222
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,560
this is kind of insane.

223
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,520
You gotta have a Qt version, a GTK version,

224
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,800
an X version, and a Wayland version.

225
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,880
You gotta support server-side decorations

226
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,520
and client-side decorations.

227
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,160
Now, you don't have to,

228
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,280
but every time you don't support one of those,

229
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,480
somebody on one of the distros on one Linux desktop

230
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,880
is gonna be making a compromise.

231
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,480
Oh, yeah, see, I was just thinking to myself there,

232
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,520
like, it's like they're really taking this seriously.

233
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,960
Doesn't the show, like, the project's doing,

234
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,760
must be doing pretty great if they're doing all these things,

235
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,560
but yeah, the flip side is exactly what you're saying.

236
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,800
That's a lot to do.

237
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,320
It is a lot to do.

238
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,720
And, Poppy, I'm wondering, do you think I'm exaggerating

239
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,120
what it takes to be a full-fledged Linux desktop,

240
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,520
or do you think that's the reality of it right now

241
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,040
if you wanna support all that stuff?

242
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,760
I think VLC's in a very particular position

243
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,560
in that they're used everywhere.

244
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,400
It's used on Mac and Windows

245
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,560
and every single Linux distribution,

246
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,960
and they have a lot of work to make it look good

247
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,120
and consistent across all of those platforms,

248
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,600
and I think they do a great job.

249
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,200
I'm also interested to point out

250
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,640
that you can, of course, track VLC

251
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,480
from the Edge channel in the Snap Store,

252
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,000
and you'll get daily builds of version four,

253
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,080
so when this stuff lands,

254
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,600
you'll get it right on your desktop

255
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,080
directly from the developers.

256
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,560
There it is.

257
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,400
There it is.

258
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,560
That's some good sauce.

259
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,480
So, Dan, what are your thoughts on something like this?

260
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,680
I think this is the problem,

261
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,120
and I honestly think this is something

262
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,560
that elementary OS could aim to solve.

263
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,400
If you really wanna be a full-fledged

264
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,440
Linux desktop application,

265
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,000
there's so many different camps

266
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,680
you need to make sure you make happy.

267
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,360
Qt, GTK, client-side, server-side, Wayland, X11,

268
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,960
and that's not even getting into the actual look

269
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,560
and design of the application.

270
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,760
You know, I remember a long time ago

271
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,440
having a conversation with the CEO over at Yorba

272
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,520
and telling him, you know, this is the future

273
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,360
that the quote-unquote Linux desktop is going toward.

274
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,120
It's not a unified thing.

275
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,200
Like, the Linux desktop is not a platform.

276
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,400
The Linux is a kernel,

277
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,720
and there are so many different desktops.

278
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,680
I think that as application developers,

279
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,080
you should pick a camp,

280
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,120
and cross-platform development is super expensive,

281
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,960
super difficult to do right,

282
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,360
and for most application developers, it's not worth it.

283
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,880
Just write for the distro you use

284
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,600
and be happy that you have a set of users

285
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,680
that like the thing that you made.

286
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,240
Yeah, I feel like what's gonna happen

287
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,360
is developers will look at all the options

288
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,480
and go, eeny, meeny, miny, electron,

289
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,040
and they'll just ship everything with electron.

290
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,440
It'll be like, all right, good enough.

291
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,400
Everybody's happy.

292
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,440
The right answer.

293
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,360
Jesus.

294
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,680
Actually, it's interesting you should say that.

295
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,920
I know we'll come to FOSDEM later,

296
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,360
but there was an interesting talk

297
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,600
about using Go and HTML

298
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,440
to build lean desktop applications

299
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,400
rather than, it was a counterpoint

300
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,000
to big fat electron apps,

301
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,440
and they were talking about how you can use Go

302
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,200
as your runtime and HTML for rendering,

303
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,760
and so there are people exploring different ways

304
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,320
to make cross-platform applications that are not electron.

305
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,120
Oh, give it a couple of years, Go,

306
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,040
plus FFmpeg, plus another interpreted language,

307
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,880
plus a toolkit.

308
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,960
It'll be as fat as mustard before too long.

309
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,160
Yeah, I mean, that's where you get, eventually,

310
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,120
when you want all of the things.

311
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,080
Yeah, hmm.

312
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,400
Well, that does sound promising.

313
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,720
I mean, I think the idea is obviously proven out,

314
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,400
and so now how do we make it as palatable as possible

315
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,840
becomes the next challenge,

316
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,480
and hopefully they can figure it out.

317
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,400
But the thing I didn't hear in all of that was Rust,

318
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,320
so not really convinced.

319
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,520
I've seen Rust on the desktop, a desktop.

320
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,360
Oh yeah?

321
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,520
It was something on Gnome, or?

322
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,320
No, it's Pop OS again.

323
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,160
Oh, okay.

324
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,440
Good, right.

325
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,800
They're trailblazing with the stylized name

326
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,800
and the use of Rust and everything.

327
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,360
That's true, they are.

328
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,920
In fact, there's some Rust fans there at that System76.

329
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,600
That's a good point.

330
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,240
Now, the Gnome shell on the other side of the,

331
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,320
I don't know, on the other side of what,

332
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,640
I guess, I felt like, oh yeah,

333
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,640
because we're talking QML.

334
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,560
There's a lot of good performance fixes coming to Gnome.

335
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,400
The work around Mudder has seen a lot of bug fixes

336
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,880
and performance fixes.

337
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,000
There's different camps involved.

338
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,040
Obviously, canonicals help tackle stutter,

339
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,840
latency, CPU issues within Gnome shell.

340
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,320
That's been, we've seen that trickling in

341
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,080
over the last couple of months,

342
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:15,080
and I got a hands-on experience with it on Ubuntu 19.04,

343
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,400
and I noticed I actually just could proceed with it.

344
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,960
It is a perceivable performance improvement.

345
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,800
That's the kind of, I mean,

346
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,760
that's the level we're talking about here.

347
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,720
When you can start to perceive it,

348
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,840
that means a lot of things have had to go into that

349
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,880
to actually make that.

350
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,880
Does it also mean, though,

351
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,680
that they kind of needed that sizable of a change?

352
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,360
Ah, yeah.

353
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,120
Yeah, maybe somebody can talk me out of this funk,

354
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,120
but I look at this and I think,

355
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,640
A, very appreciative of this work.

356
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,080
They're doing the people's work here with this stuff.

357
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,600
There's also a developer over at Endless recently

358
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,800
that submitted some performance fixes upstream.

359
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,960
There's multiple camps now doing the people's work,

360
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,400
but it's still really not there,

361
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,000
and the fundamental issue is still that architecture

362
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,480
where it's a lot of things riding on a single process,

363
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,640
from mutter to extensions.

364
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,320
It's just an architecture issue,

365
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,000
and it is definitely appreciated that it is faster

366
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,560
and that it is a better end user experience,

367
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,160
and I'll take that, and I will happily use that,

368
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,960
but I can't help but have this sinking feeling

369
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,280
in the back of my head.

370
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,560
It's still not a workstation-grade desktop.

371
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,520
It still feels very consumer.

372
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,040
I don't know what the right word I'm looking for there,

373
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,520
because I wouldn't even say consumer.

374
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,720
If the architecture is fundamentally busted,

375
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,680
what does it really matter

376
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,760
if it's getting near 60 frames per second animation?

377
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,440
I mean, it matters, but it's kind of like saying

378
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,120
that you have really great appliances,

379
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,600
and you redid your kitchen counters and cabinetry

380
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,680
in your home, but your foundation is crumbling.

381
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,480
I mean, I guess it depends on who it matters for,

382
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,080
and I guess it seems like it has bad foundations to us now,

383
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,320
but at one time, it was probably fine.

384
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,120
I mean, we were just kind of talking the other day

385
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,440
about how just running on a laptop, GNOME does pretty well,

386
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,400
and honestly, on my ThinkPad,

387
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,800
I've had way more plasma desktop crashes

388
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,480
than I have GNOME crashes.

389
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,320
Oh, really?

390
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,760
Yeah, oh yeah, I mean, not major crashes,

391
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,840
but just this morning, I was working on show prep,

392
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,480
and all the title bars disappeared, and I couldn't Alt-Tab.

393
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,720
I couldn't change which window was selected anymore,

394
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,000
and I just had to log out and log back in.

395
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,760
Your server-side decorations died.

396
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,880
It just, yeah, totally gone, yeah.

397
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,000
Whereas with GNOME, by and large, it kind of just worked,

398
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,840
but you're right.

399
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,160
It obviously is running into limitations of its design now,

400
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,600
but maybe it worked for a while,

401
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,840
and it's also probably difficult, too,

402
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,920
because I think we ended up using the older versions of GNOME

403
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,680
in workstation-type things.

404
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,840
It had been really proved out.

405
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,520
It would kind of fit in that space,

406
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,400
and obviously, GNOME's kind of targeting something else now.

407
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,080
I think you're being a little unfair.

408
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,880
There are millions of people right now using GNOME

409
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,440
as their workstation platform.

410
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,400
They're running it for either gaming for consumers,

411
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,280
but also tons of developers have developer-oriented things,

412
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:11,280
IDEs, Android Studio, Atom, VS Code,

413
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,640
all these kind of applications they're using

414
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,640
on a daily basis to do development on a Linux desktop.

415
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,640
They might not be developing for a Linux desktop.

416
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,280
They might be developing Java business applications,

417
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,960
or they might be developing Android apps,

418
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:27,120
but there definitely are many, many people using

419
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,440
GNOME Desktop as a workstation machine on a daily basis,

420
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,240
and they get on just fine.

421
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,480
Yeah, I think I have to acknowledge that that's fact,

422
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,520
so there's no getting around that.

423
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,440
It's sort of one of those confidence issues.

424
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,680
It'd be just like if I had a beautiful car,

425
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,600
you open up the hood,

426
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,680
and it was just a mess underneath the hood.

427
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,960
It would betray my confidence in that vehicle

428
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,120
to really carry me the distance.

429
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,600
You probably have other objectives too, right?

430
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,840
Like you don't really care, for instance,

431
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,320
if like the swarm animation got a little more fluid.

432
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,320
You want a desktop that you know is rock solid,

433
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,360
won't crash, and won't ever lose your work.

434
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,160
I've had so few crashes in GNOME Shell.

435
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,720
Like I am the epitome of that person

436
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,400
who leaves their machine on all the time,

437
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,120
like days and days and days and days and days.

438
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,080
I have very long uptime on my GNOME Shell desktop

439
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,480
with multiple screens with very long running applications

440
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,840
that eat tons and tons of memory,

441
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,640
and I almost never restart GNOME Shell,

442
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,120
almost never log out, almost never reboot,

443
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,600
and I cannot remember the last crash that I had.

444
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,400
The most annoying things I have

445
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,640
are actually things to do with the things beneath that,

446
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,360
like the NVIDIA driver.

447
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,120
Like Ubuntu, not Ubuntu, GNOME itself,

448
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,640
it's actually more rock solid now

449
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,240
than I've ever seen it before.

450
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,200
Huh, okay.

451
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,960
You know, you're making me wanna stick with it even more,

452
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,840
which really gets under my skin

453
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,160
because that's gonna make Westpain's prediction,

454
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,480
it's gonna, I mean, I think I still have like a month

455
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,040
to like, to get out of this,

456
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,560
but it's not trending in the right direction.

457
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,720
I have been really impressed.

458
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,200
Now, I haven't gone all cray-cray

459
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,800
with like external video cards and multiple monitors

460
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,640
and stuff like that.

461
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,920
The real pressure test, right?

462
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,760
Right, that's what,

463
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,520
that was where my love affair with plasma started.

464
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,720
It's not that I don't like it still,

465
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,680
it's just that I started to hit up against a set of cracks

466
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,080
that I hadn't encountered before.

467
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,080
And that, so far, I have not fully, fully tested.

468
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,120
I've done a brief test where I hooked up to all the screens

469
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,680
and things seemed like they were working well

470
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,520
and I went, okay, cool.

471
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,840
And I, you know, three hours later, I was done.

472
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,300
Like, but I need to spend days with it still.

473
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,560
So I have a feeling that's gonna happen.

474
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:44,560
I should write a book about the perpetual distro hopper

475
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,520
and desktop hopper

476
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,480
because I've been doing this now since the 90s

477
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,600
and I don't, I don't know.

478
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,040
I mean, I'm pretty much sticking

479
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,480
with the Ubuntu base these days.

480
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,640
You know, I've slowed down my base hopping

481
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,520
where I was on Arch for a while

482
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,680
and then I came back to Ubuntu.

483
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,280
And like, if I ever jumped again,

484
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,120
it might, you know,

485
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,560
like say like something like Debian or something,

486
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,220
I feel like it would be a good five-year run.

487
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,760
Like I'm slowing down the base,

488
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,560
but the desktops, I'm still at like a six to nine month clip.

489
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,680
How long have we been on plasma, Wes?

490
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,720
I guess it's been since Linux Fest last year.

491
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,320
So it's almost been a year that I made it for plasma.

492
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,800
Now you do seem tempted every now and again

493
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,720
when we review a particularly good Fedora workstation,

494
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,560
I will say.

495
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,080
I think it's been longer than a year

496
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,600
because we were with you in Seattle this time last year

497
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,060
when you did the plasma challenge

498
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,560
and that's when Papi switched.

499
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,400
Right.

500
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,480
Yeah, that's when I did it on the plane

501
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,400
and I still have that same install.

502
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,420
Okay. Okay.

503
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,200
So that is a pretty good run for me.

504
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,960
That's a pretty good run actually.

505
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,560
So I don't have to really beat up on myself

506
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,480
for trying out Gnome again

507
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,960
because that would be a reasonable thing to do

508
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,400
after a period of time is to try out Gnome again

509
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,280
and see if it.

510
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,120
And there it is.

511
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,960
There's the personal acceptance

512
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,040
and where's your protection is about to come true.

513
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,960
Yeah, there's the self-justification.

514
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,800
Job done.

515
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,620
Thank you, gentlemen.

516
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,920
All right.

517
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,060
Well, we've got to talk Bitcoin.

518
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,400
Oh no, please no.

519
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,240
Yeah.

520
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,520
Just, you know, I don't know what you guys make of this.

521
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,600
Is it done now?

522
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,320
So it's around 3,400 US greenbacks

523
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,680
is the average price of Bitcoin.

524
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,920
But if you look at the trading volumes on cryptocurrency

525
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,480
exchanges, they've dipped to new lows in January,

526
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,560
according to an analysis that was published on the 4th.

527
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,320
So that would be yesterday.

528
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,460
Since the beginning of the year,

529
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,920
the digital currency exchanges have reportedly registered

530
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,340
lower trading volumes, marking new lows

531
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,920
that have not been recorded since 2017.

532
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,040
Since 2017 is kind of forever in the Bitcoin world.

533
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,860
That has been a long, long time.

534
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,440
Can I just say I enjoy not having

535
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,600
to talk about it all the time?

536
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,820
That has been nice.

537
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,200
Yeah, you're right.

538
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,680
Coinbase also chimed in and says they're experiencing lows

539
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,200
which they haven't seen since May of 2017.

540
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,800
So what does that tell us?

541
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,320
Is the cryptocurrency hype dead

542
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,240
and we're just seeing like the base market at play here now?

543
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,600
Or is the whole idea kind of over?

544
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,840
I think the more interesting metric

545
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:21,840
is the cost of Ethereum over the last say 14 months.

546
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,000
Because when the whole crypto boom happened

547
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
and people were off buying GPUs

548
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,200
like they were going out of fashion

549
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,460
and driving up the cost of GPUs,

550
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,480
they were mining Ethereum in order

551
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,000
to turn Ethereum into Bitcoin ultimately,

552
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
because you can still mine Ethereum on not ASICs.

553
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,360
And that's dropped in price from about $1,400

554
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,200
to a touch over $100 in the same period.

555
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,160
I wonder, so this Geek Tweets,

556
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,560
do you think if we had a killer app all of a sudden

557
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,480
spring up that used Bitcoin, it'd be better off?

558
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,720
You think the issue is that there just isn't really

559
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,600
any sign of a resurgence coming to Bitcoin's aid here?

560
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,960
I don't think there is in terms of financial transactions,

561
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,360
but if there is an application for it then potentially,

562
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,240
but I don't really see one at the moment.

563
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,520
It worked well for me like doing

564
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,100
some actual financial transactions

565
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,360
way back when it was like $200 a coin.

566
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,640
And you know, maybe it was like fast enough

567
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,480
you could get through.

568
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,760
I paid for some like seed boxes and stuff with it

569
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,800
and that was fine.

570
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,240
But these days there's just,

571
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,280
other payment methods have gotten better.

572
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,440
Credit card processing is a little faster.

573
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,520
It's hard to say that there is a killer app out there

574
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,840
besides all the other sort of like distributed

575
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,920
ledger research the bigger companies are doing.

576
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,160
But yeah, I think it's in part that the cost

577
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:45,440
to get your Bitcoin transaction approved fast

578
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,280
got kind of high as the network got really busy.

579
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,920
But also there's like a dozen different ways now

580
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,280
to easily send cash directly between people,

581
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,120
at least here in the States.

582
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,080
And I think it's even better in some countries

583
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,420
outside the States.

584
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,200
Like for example, the cash application

585
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,680
or Google Pay or Apple Pay,

586
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,680
make it very simple now to just use a messaging system

587
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,700
and send somebody some money.

588
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,960
And that direct person to person transfer,

589
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,000
which is behind the scenes,

590
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,760
really probably ACH transfers between banks

591
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,320
and all kinds of complicated things.

592
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,080
Complicated fronting to make it seem like it shows up.

593
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,920
Right.

594
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,480
That's gotta be happening,

595
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,780
which isn't necessary with Bitcoin.

596
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,880
But the banks are willing to operate at that risk level

597
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,440
and they're willing to do all the behind the scenes work

598
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,000
to make it seem very seamless.

599
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,360
From our perspective with using the cash app,

600
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,280
I could send a hundred bucks to Hadia

601
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,840
in two minutes and she could transfer to her account

602
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,840
in two minutes after that.

603
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,740
And it's essentially as good as using Bitcoin

604
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,880
in that regard.

605
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,440
So you have that downward pressure for consumers,

606
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,120
plus you have the challenges they hit as the network grew,

607
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,200
and then some of the challenges they continue to have

608
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,600
just as the cryptocurrency market matures.

609
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,080
And it really kind of just comes down to your perspective.

610
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,080
If you bought into Bitcoin when it was $11,

611
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,720
when I came to Bitcoin, it was between $2 and $11.

612
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,360
And that's when we started covering it

613
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,560
on the TechSnap program.

614
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:15,240
And so if you bought in at $11,

615
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,840
then $3,400 is still a pretty fantastic return.

616
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,900
It's not $21,000, but it's still pretty fantastic.

617
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,560
Yeah, the last time I actually paid for Bitcoin,

618
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,160
like bought Bitcoin, I was paying $100 a coin.

619
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:33,060
So even that is a good return on today's prices.

620
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,880
But I don't think it's gonna last for much longer.

621
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,020
I think it's on the edge of capitulating completely.

622
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,260
Well, Skoll Leader, what do you think?

623
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,960
Maybe the currency goes away,

624
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,480
but the blockchain technology sticks around?

625
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,440
Yeah, I think that most businesses are looking at blockchain,

626
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,440
especially with IoT, as a method of exchange.

627
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,320
And I think that's what's going to stay.

628
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,280
I think Bitcoin is a store of value.

629
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,800
It's just, it's untenable.

630
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,080
The higher it got, the more transactions cost,

631
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,480
the longer it took.

632
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,760
But blockchain is for doing transaction.

633
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,560
I think that's where it's going to be.

634
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,040
Yeah, I could definitely see that.

635
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,080
I think that I could see all kinds of different uses

636
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,140
for business for the blockchain and forks of it,

637
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,240
essentially, it'll be blockchain technology

638
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,760
with their own twist on it.

639
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,000
Yeah, smart contracts, as you're pointing out, Poppy,

640
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,260
I could clearly see that.

641
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,320
Or just between companies

642
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,500
that don't necessarily trust each other.

643
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,040
There's a lot of value in being able to have a document

644
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,800
that they can rely on.

645
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,200
It almost writes its own checks in that case,

646
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,440
at least I think.

647
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,440
So, Dan, I was thinking about it in the context

648
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,440
of taking online payments.

649
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,040
To me, I always thought the ideal situation would be

650
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,640
is if Bitcoin was a successful,

651
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,520
not only just a transfer mechanism,

652
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,680
is what I was going to call it,

653
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,600
but also if it was a stable store of value.

654
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,720
So say it was pegged at $100 US,

655
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,520
and it was that way for five years,

656
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,760
and you knew for five years, one Bitcoin was $100.

657
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,640
I actually thought this would be the perfect way

658
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,560
for open source projects to take in donations

659
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,600
from different currencies,

660
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,880
convert it to one common currency,

661
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,600
and then cash it out in whatever country they're at.

662
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,800
And same with things like app stores.

663
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,740
Do you think that's a legitimate use

664
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,960
for something like a cryptocurrency,

665
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,480
assuming some of those things are standardized

666
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,340
and normalized?

667
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,280
I think some of the big problems we have

668
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:27,960
is just not technology, but it's also on the legal side.

669
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,560
And so something that we get from a payment processor

670
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,760
like Stripe isn't just the ability to process credit cards,

671
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,480
but they also keep track of things like

672
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,560
which countries are on the US sanctions list

673
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,220
that we're not allowed to do business with,

674
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,720
when the government's going to come after us.

675
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,640
So it's stuff that we have to be really careful with

676
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,560
on the legal side,

677
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,440
and just solving the technology piece

678
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,880
doesn't really help us as a business stay

679
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,280
in the kind of legal area we need to be in.

680
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,200
Right, fair enough.

681
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,440
And when you have things like GDPR and other countries

682
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,280
that are thinking about adopting policies like GDPR,

683
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,680
it's nice to know that there's companies

684
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,160
whose business it is, is to navigate that kind of thing

685
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,840
and make sure that you're not going to get in trouble.

686
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,400
Makes sense, because that's not your core competency.

687
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,200
You've got a distribution to build, you know?

688
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,420
And we don't want to be lawyers.

689
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,960
We don't want to have a big legal team

690
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,120
and do all these kind of things.

691
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,240
So it is really nice to offload that off

692
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,680
onto another team that does want to be in that business.

693
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,360
And it keeps us writing software

694
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,280
instead of doing all these other things.

695
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,360
Right, fair enough.

696
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,640
Well, so you've got to imagine it's things like that

697
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,720
and a million others that are applying downward pressure.

698
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,520
And we just have to wait and see where things fall.

699
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,600
I think ultimately there's a use for the technology.

700
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,320
I think the current price even is ridiculous.

701
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,280
And maybe that's because I've been coming in forever now.

702
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,880
And so I've seen it when it was very cheap,

703
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,160
but to me, really a ridiculous price right now.

704
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,600
And I could see it falling much, much further.

705
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,480
But even if Bitcoins were only worth a few dollars

706
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,560
or a hundred dollars, there's still a market for them.

707
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,000
Some of it's illegal, but there's still a market for them.

708
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,600
And so I don't think they're going away completely.

709
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,480
I want to do a FOSDM check-in

710
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,680
and we got to talk about Pi-Hole.

711
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,080
So let's do a moment of housekeeping first,

712
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,340
just here about midway through the show.

713
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,560
This is a tricky one.

714
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,060
I've never really done this on air before.

715
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:21,400
Ooh, a big wind, big winds are hitting me right now.

716
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,860
I've never done this on air before,

717
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:26,400
but I'm going to ask if a few of you

718
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,520
wouldn't kindly mind updating our Wikipedia entry.

719
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,960
It's pretty out of date now.

720
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,340
And there's probably more source material coming soon

721
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,420
that could go on there, like new logos

722
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,920
and descriptions of our hosts,

723
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,200
like Jim and Jason that have joined recently

724
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,320
and Elle, who we just met last week.

725
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,660
So there's a lot of stuff

726
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,020
that we don't have source material for to use from.

727
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:53,700
So unless you happen to just know it all, I understand.

728
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,000
And don't worry, we are working on that,

729
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,440
but yeah, if you have a free time, free moment,

730
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,520
a free second, a reason to edit Wikipedia

731
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,040
and would like to update some of that stuff that you know,

732
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,640
I'd appreciate that.

733
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,360
Because as you know,

734
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,320
I'm not supposed to be the one to update the entry,

735
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,600
which is understandable, but also kind of silly

736
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,680
because I could just write all that stuff.

737
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,940
I could just write all this stuff that's not on our website,

738
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,020
that's needs to be on our website, but that's cool.

739
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,080
I understand that's how the system works.

740
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,800
Also, looking for somebody who might be interested

741
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:28,040
in continuing the development of our Roku application.

742
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,200
It seems Roku as a platform is continuing to grow

743
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,060
and our application is very old.

744
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,800
And it is an open source project

745
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,260
that is up on our Jupiter broadcasting GitHub.

746
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:41,860
Sibo Jar has donated his time so far to maintain it,

747
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,400
but I don't even think he has a Roku anymore.

748
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,620
And we would definitely love to have somebody

749
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,960
help us update that and then, you know,

750
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,840
maybe we would submit it to the store.

751
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,880
I don't really know how that process works,

752
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,660
but that's something that Wes and I are thinking about

753
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,440
is maybe, you know, we have a community maintained

754
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,000
open source Roku app that other podcast networks

755
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,240
could also use to host their shows

756
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,600
or get their shows up on Roku

757
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,360
because that's the thing people like to do.

758
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,800
You know, and a lot of times you just need to like,

759
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,360
sort of, you know, it might have like a tiny little theme

760
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,480
or skin to it and then it's basically implementing

761
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,040
whatever video player they ship in their SDK

762
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,800
and pointing it at one of our URLs.

763
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,360
Yeah, we also have JSON feeds and stuff

764
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,040
that we didn't have before when that application

765
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,880
was originally written.

766
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,560
So maybe there's a different way, I don't know.

767
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,080
So that's just something to think about.

768
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,240
If you want to participate in that, keep in mind,

769
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,660
we also have an art refresh coming to our shows.

770
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,160
So if you do maintain a JB related application,

771
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,080
keep that in mind.

772
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,940
And if you want to get the new art when it is ready,

773
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,640
you can contact Angela or you can join

774
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,280
our Jupiter broadcasting telegram group

775
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,300
for Jupiter developers, which we have linked in the show notes

776
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,940
that Jupiter Dev Telegram,

777
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:52,000
which I think Wes you're in there, I'm in there.

778
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,240
I sure am. So if you want to work with us

779
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,360
on updating an application or have one that you maintain,

780
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,040
do be aware that new art is coming in the near future

781
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,640
and you'll need to grab that stuff because it's good stuff.

782
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,360
Yeah, but now's a good time to go figure out

783
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,820
like, yeah, what platform should we be on?

784
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,960
What are we missing now and how do we make it happen?

785
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,200
I have been thinking about that.

786
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,680
I have been wondering what other platforms we should get on.

787
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,440
We've gotten, everybody has now, but we're on Spotify

788
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,120
like everybody else is now,

789
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,240
which is kind of cool, I suppose.

790
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,960
And I don't think they re-host.

791
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,800
Have you guys considered using BitChute yet?

792
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,020
I can't remember if we actually got around

793
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,860
to testing or not.

794
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,240
It has been discussed, absolutely,

795
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,480
but I can't remember if we actually got around

796
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,600
to testing it.

797
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,000
I might circle back to BitChute.

798
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,720
And of course we have the PeerTube instance as well.

799
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,160
And now another bit, one more thing.

800
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,240
Well, actually we have two more things,

801
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,160
but something that we just open sourced,

802
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:50,160
Mr. Wes Payne, software developer and podcaster

803
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,200
and man about town has released FM,

804
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,240
which is a simple script that takes in an RTMP stream

805
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,680
from anything that you can get an RTMP stream from,

806
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,800
and then we'll re-stream the audio of that

807
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,360
to an ice cast server.

808
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:07,800
Wes, why don't you tell people like how we have this set up,

809
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,000
why we have this set up, like the way it's running,

810
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,560
like all of the, like any of the kind of details

811
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,920
it'd be cool to share, because this is a neat stuff.

812
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,400
You know, I was just, I was just pleased to know

813
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,400
that besides being able to send an RTMP stream,

814
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,440
well, FFFPEG can receive one.

815
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,120
So you don't have to set up a complicated stateful server

816
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,080
to handle all that stuff.

817
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,480
We ran into this problem because, well,

818
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,000
we used to do a lot of video shows.

819
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,760
That's not really the case anymore.

820
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,560
Maybe that will change, we will see.

821
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,440
So our main streaming rig is all set up to operate

822
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,440
around OBS and sending video streams up to scale engine

823
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,720
and YouTube and everywhere else that you can find us.

824
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,960
Turns out we also like to have an audio stream,

825
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,840
especially since we're doing so many audio shows.

826
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,920
Unfortunately, the various things and codecs that play

827
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,960
over in RTMP world, not so friendly over in ice cast.

828
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,480
So we needed a little bridge to connect

829
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,520
our already existing ice cast server

830
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,120
with our live streams from scale engine.

831
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,440
So that's what FM does, it's not super complicated,

832
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,840
but if anyone else runs into that situation,

833
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,960
it might be handy, it just runs on a little Docker file,

834
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,800
runs in a loop, and then once we start a live stream,

835
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,040
scale engine says an RTMP push over to FM.

836
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,160
Yes, it's actually, it's really simple and straightforward

837
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,600
in that West put it all up in a container.

838
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,280
We have it up on a digital ocean droplet

839
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,960
that we run for other things.

840
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,560
So it doesn't take a ton of resources.

841
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,040
It's basically as much as like a VLC would pulling

842
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,560
in a video stream, and then it's stripping the audio

843
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,960
and sending it back out.

844
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,720
And we have that streaming at jblive.fm.

845
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,920
And what's great is it's actually,

846
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,880
I think in most cases ahead of the video streams

847
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,400
because of the way the whole RTMP streaming order

848
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,020
works over at scale engine, like it's the first feed

849
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,960
for jblive.fm, so now our audio streams,

850
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,320
like I think our lowest delay stream.

851
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,880
It'll be right there with RTMP, they'll be real close,

852
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,160
but everything else will be behind.

853
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,240
Yeah, that's pretty great.

854
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,360
And it works great in the mobile web browser too, jblive.fm.

855
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,560
And if you for some reason ever need to take audio

856
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,320
off of the RTMP stream and restream it,

857
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,000
go grab West's open source code.

858
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,240
We have it up on github.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

859
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,080
All right, that's a lot of stuff,

860
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:18,040
but we're trying to figure out a way to talk about

861
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,240
some of the open source projects we're beginning to release

862
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,640
in a way that doesn't drag down the show,

863
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,920
but still lets you know they're out there,

864
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,400
because what's the point of releasing them

865
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,560
if we don't tell you?

866
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,680
So hopefully this format works.

867
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,640
I suppose in the future, if it was some massive project,

868
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,440
we might dedicate a show to it,

869
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,440
but right now we'll put it in the housekeeping section.

870
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,640
And last but not least, we have the votes open

871
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,860
for a March study group.

872
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:44,920
We've gotten so many good meetup signups, feedback,

873
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,200
people already beginning to vote

874
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,040
because we've released it earlier.

875
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,840
Like there's just so much feedback already coming in

876
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,280
before we even held the first study group

877
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,760
that we decided we try another one in March

878
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,120
and let you vote on what the topic's gonna be.

879
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,040
There's a couple in there that are really good.

880
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,400
So I'll have a link to that in the show notes

881
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,200
at linuxunplugged.com slash 287.

882
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,600
You know, I see Vim, the improved editor.

883
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,440
That's an option.

884
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,640
I vote for that already,

885
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,160
just so we can finally get you to learn.

886
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,000
The bastard.

887
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,400
How come there's not one on Nano in there?

888
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,200
I should go create a Nano Essentials course.

889
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,040
You have fun with that.

890
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:18,900
It'd probably be the least viewed course on the platform.

891
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,620
Yeah, there's some good things in here.

892
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,240
Visual Studio Code Essentials course, surely.

893
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,220
Yeah, that would be good, wouldn't it?

894
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,040
The first step when setting up a Linux studio

895
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,040
is to set your editor back to Nano

896
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,780
after Wes Payne's been in there changing things to Vim.

897
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,960
Like I wouldn't notice.

898
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,900
Like I wouldn't notice.

899
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,600
Yeah, there's also LXC and LXD.

900
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,240
Deep dive in here.

901
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,080
Big Data Essentials, if you wanna wrap your head

902
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,280
around that, or DevOps Essentials.

903
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,920
But the one that I'm kinda hoping people vote for

904
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,960
is either Linux, I'm not gonna, I don't wanna sway it,

905
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,040
but I'm just gonna say there's a Git Quick Start

906
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,540
and a Linux Operating System Fundamentals in there.

907
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,240
We'll be doing future study groups on.

908
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,160
And those study groups will be taking place

909
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,620
after Linux Unplugged.

910
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,320
It's not in the show.

911
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,440
It's just, it's not part of the show.

912
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,720
If you wanna join us, go to meetup.com

913
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:11,280
slash Jupiter Broadcasting for the details on that.

914
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,040
All right, well that's the housekeeping.

915
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,400
So, oh, you know, while we're just talking

916
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,760
about network stuff, Mr. Wes Payne

917
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,320
has been on the Coder Radio program

918
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,080
while I have been in Texas and killing it.

919
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,320
I just think you've been doing a great job.

920
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,300
So if you haven't checked out Coder Radio, coder.show.

921
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,620
Go listen to the last few episodes.

922
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,180
I think the last one was your guys' best episode, Wes.

923
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,400
I think it was a really good one.

924
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,280
Oh, well, thank you.

925
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,720
Having lots of fun chatting with Mike

926
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,080
and getting to pick his weird Floridian brain.

927
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:40,440
Yeah, yeah, it is that, isn't it?

928
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,340
All right, well, let's talk a little bit

929
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:45,160
about FOSDEM 2019.

930
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,000
It was something that I had really, really, really

931
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,240
high hopes of attending.

932
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:53,240
And it did not work out for multiple reasons.

933
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,560
But I did manage to catch a flavor of FOSDEM

934
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,840
by watching the live streams.

935
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,040
Good morning, everyone.

936
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,200
I hope you can all find a seat somewhere.

937
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,240
There's plenty of them available.

938
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:09,900
So welcome to FOSDEM 2019.

939
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,340
It's a bit more snowy than we expected.

940
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,040
I hope you all got here safely.

941
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,960
But yeah, at least some of you made it, so that's good.

942
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,680
Some of you, like Mr. Popey, made it.

943
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,180
It was a pretty big crowd, it looked like,

944
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,960
from the streams that I saw, Popey.

945
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,760
And I don't know if you got any idea

946
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,400
of how many people attended.

947
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,960
Lots, thousands.

948
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,000
The main room is called Janssen,

949
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,840
and that's where all the keynotes happen.

950
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,680
And the reported capacity for that room

951
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,400
is like 1,400 people, and it was people sat all up and down

952
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,680
all the stairs, so every chair was full.

953
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,400
They were like demanding people move into the middle

954
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,760
of the rows so that everyone could get a seat.

955
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,200
And then there were people spilling out all over the floor,

956
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,380
like people coming in all through all the talks

957
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,400
and sitting all over the floor.

958
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,200
It was a ton of people there, and every room was busy.

959
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,280
Some of them, obviously most of the rooms

960
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,240
are much smaller than that, and it got to the point

961
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,000
where some of the rooms were just rammed all day.

962
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,960
There's like a DNS room, and it was just full

963
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,280
all day, every day.

964
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,480
And if you go to a room, there are people queuing

965
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,920
to get in, waiting to get in.

966
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,360
If someone goes out to the toilet,

967
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,920
they're like busting to get in.

968
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,600
But the good news is every room was live-streamed,

969
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,880
so if you couldn't get in the room,

970
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,760
you could stand outside and get your phone out

971
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,360
or your laptop out, and there were people just standing

972
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,080
around watching live streams or huddled around a laptop

973
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,680
to watch a stream of a room they're standing next to.

974
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,520
It was quite amazing.

975
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,480
Wow, that is an impressive feat.

976
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,040
That is.

977
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,780
I feel like I have a bond now with them,

978
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,280
because I was doing a lot of that online,

979
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,780
and they are also posting a lot of these talks.

980
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,160
It takes a while to get all of them out there,

981
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,260
but they've already posted a whole bunch,

982
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,400
which we will have linked in the notes.

983
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,760
The way they do it is the speaker gets an email

984
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,480
after their talk, and the speaker gets to review it,

985
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,400
and once they review it, it goes live shortly after that.

986
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,800
But it's pretty much all automated.

987
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,240
It's pretty amazing the way they've got it working now.

988
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,240
It's really, really good.

989
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,920
So is it too much?

990
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,760
Is it too big?

991
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,840
Is it too many things?

992
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,880
Like, looking at the schedule,

993
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,560
it just seems there's so much FOMO,

994
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,500
because you can't make it to any of that stuff.

995
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,500
You can only make it to one thing at a time,

996
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:19,500
and then you add the crowds and how packed the rooms are.

997
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,280
Is it too much?

998
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,000
I think they, I mean, they constantly have to think about

999
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,960
what venue they use, and it is a sizable venue.

1000
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,840
There's 63 tracks, 43 dev rooms,

1001
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,020
and then there's exhibition space as well with 65 stands.

1002
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,840
So there's a lot of space taken up,

1003
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:42,840
and they use a lot of rooms spread across loads of buildings.

1004
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,640
You have to hurry from one room to another,

1005
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,960
and all you get embedded in one room

1006
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,520
for a talk that you want to see in three hours' time,

1007
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,800
but you get in there early in order to sit through two talks,

1008
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,360
and then, and you might even be watching a talk

1009
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,400
from another room while you're waiting for the talk

1010
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,060
that you actually want to see coming up.

1011
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,240
I mean, it's a bit ludicrous,

1012
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,280
but that's mitigated by all the live streaming

1013
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,200
and the recorded video that's published afterwards.

1014
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,840
So they have an app, so you can sit there

1015
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,360
and tag all the things that you want to go and see,

1016
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,800
and it will remind you when they're coming,

1017
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,000
or it's got a little map,

1018
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,880
and it will navigate you to the room you want to go to.

1019
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,760
So it's just so well run, really, really well done,

1020
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,880
and it's all community run by an organizing committee.

1021
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,120
It's not a corporate event by any stretch.

1022
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,120
They have a few sponsors.

1023
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:31,480
The university itself in Solbosch in Brussels

1024
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,480
is the main sponsor.

1025
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,140
Google and Red Hat also sponsor at a high tier,

1026
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:39,520
and then there's like 10 other sponsors, including us.

1027
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,160
But it's a major event, and you walk the halls,

1028
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,520
and as I'm walking along,

1029
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,040
you get that little flutter of celebrity.

1030
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,600
You see all your friends,

1031
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,520
but also you see loads of other people

1032
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,480
from the open source world,

1033
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,160
anyone you can name, not just the Uber celebrities

1034
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,080
who've been around for years and years,

1035
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,080
like John Mad Dog Hall,

1036
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,240
but you can see Leonard Pottering,

1037
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,800
and people from other podcasts,

1038
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,800
and developers who work on that favorite project

1039
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,640
that you have.

1040
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:11,060
There's so many people go to this event, yes,

1041
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:14,100
and I'm sure they do their absolute best

1042
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,080
to get people in the rooms, but it is very difficult.

1043
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,040
So that was gonna be my next question was,

1044
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:21,720
is the MeetSpace meetings,

1045
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,600
is it very valuable?

1046
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,320
Because I know you're a great person

1047
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,160
to ask that question to,

1048
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,760
because you've gone to so many different Linux events

1049
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,040
in different countries,

1050
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,480
and literally all around the world,

1051
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,760
and so I'm wondering how this kind of stacks up

1052
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,280
that sort of MeetSpace value

1053
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,740
compared to some of the other events.

1054
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,580
It's great.

1055
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:43,160
It's got one of the better social calendars of any,

1056
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,440
because there's opportunity

1057
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,960
to talk to so many different people.

1058
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,560
I mean, there's also opportunity

1059
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,040
to miss conversations with people,

1060
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,620
because there are so many people there.

1061
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:54,880
It's not like there's only one person

1062
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,480
that you're likely to want to talk to.

1063
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,440
I missed conversations with so many people.

1064
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,760
I had great meetings with people from the KDE community

1065
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,160
and people from the GNOME community,

1066
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:06,560
and bumped into my old boss who now works at GitLab,

1067
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,960
and you bump into podcasters who you haven't seen for years,

1068
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,660
and it was just lovely to meet up with those people

1069
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:15,720
in corridors and just bump into them,

1070
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,700
and people would come up to me and shake my hand.

1071
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:20,820
In fact, it became a running joke of Fosdian with my friends,

1072
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,400
because people came up to me and were like,

1073
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,720
oh, you're Alan Pope, aren't you?

1074
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,520
And I'd shake my hands, really like the podcast,

1075
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,160
and to the point where that is now something

1076
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,360
my friends say to me in real life.

1077
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,680
Oh, you're that podcaster, aren't you?

1078
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,120
Just to take the mix.

1079
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,560
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1080
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah, totally.

1081
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:40,140
But it's a great event.

1082
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:43,200
It's so well run, and the facilities are great.

1083
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,320
There's food and drink nearby,

1084
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,500
and there's public transport.

1085
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,700
You can get a tram or a bus,

1086
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,900
or if you have to, you can get an Uber.

1087
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,900
And there are even little Lime scooters

1088
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,000
you can jump on and scoot around the place.

1089
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,920
It's really worth going.

1090
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,480
And there's so many great talks as well.

1091
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:03,520
So they have tracks for loads of different subjects,

1092
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,760
but obviously there's keynotes

1093
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,160
that are definitely worth seeing.

1094
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,980
And there was one at the very start

1095
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:11,500
with Bradley Coon and Karen Sandler talking about,

1096
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:15,860
is it possible to live a life of only using free software?

1097
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:18,360
And talking about the challenges that come with,

1098
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,600
you know, if you work for a company

1099
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,440
that mandate you shouldn't demand

1100
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,160
that anyone has to use proprietary software,

1101
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:26,480
that you should only use free software if you possibly can.

1102
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,860
You know, it's quite a challenge to do that,

1103
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:30,120
and I'm sure many people appreciate that.

1104
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:33,680
And there are other talks like the Tor project

1105
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,920
gave a talk about the state of Tor,

1106
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,160
and the Matrix project talked about

1107
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,640
how Matrix is being adopted by French government,

1108
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,120
and they're using it internally,

1109
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,000
and the amount of changes they've had to make,

1110
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,800
and user interface changes to Matrix

1111
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,000
in order to facilitate that.

1112
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,600
And it's, yeah, there's so many talks,

1113
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,000
but the great thing is, because it's archived,

1114
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,240
I can queue them up and sit and watch them later.

1115
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,760
True.

1116
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,240
I'll link to the John Mad Dog one,

1117
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,080
because that would look like just,

1118
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,440
I watched the whole thing live.

1119
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:08,440
It was 50 years of Unix and Linux advances.

1120
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,280
And it's really poignant right now,

1121
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,240
especially in the age of the cloud.

1122
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,140
I don't know if I 100% agree with all of his conclusions,

1123
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:17,320
but if he isn't just one of the best speakers

1124
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,220
in our community.

1125
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:22,880
Right, that was like sitting around the campfire

1126
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,040
with granddad telling you stories of the last 50 years,

1127
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:30,160
but the grandchildren being like 2,000 of them in the room.

1128
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,320
And it was very well received, that talk.

1129
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:36,600
Yeah, I think it's one of my favorite random moments

1130
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,920
that's ever happened to me still,

1131
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,920
is when I was at Linux Fest Northwest many years ago,

1132
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,240
while we were live on air,

1133
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,340
the guys around the booth funneled John Mad Dog Hall

1134
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:47,400
down to sit next to me.

1135
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,080
And I just got this completely unplanned,

1136
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:53,240
unexpected interview with John Mad Dog.

1137
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,140
And it was just great.

1138
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:56,600
I just really enjoyed the conversation.

1139
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:00,920
And I noted in his talk that he said he's going

1140
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:04,360
to stop traveling around to these events in 2025.

1141
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,720
So there's only a few more years of this.

1142
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,800
So I will have that linked in the show notes.

1143
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,680
Also, I'll have linked in the show notes,

1144
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,720
Mr. Popey did a lightning talk.

1145
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,200
So you were in the lightning talk track.

1146
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,000
What was that like, being involved in that process?

1147
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,640
So that is interesting,

1148
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,920
because like most conferences I go to,

1149
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,800
lightning talks is like they set aside a portion

1150
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,760
of a day for lightning talks.

1151
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,320
But no, not FOSDEM, it's like all day, both days,

1152
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,360
Saturday and Sunday, solid lightning talks all day.

1153
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,280
And so there's a constant change.

1154
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,400
There's like your 15 minute talk

1155
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,880
and then five minutes changeover.

1156
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,560
15 minute talk, five minutes changeover.

1157
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,180
And they are strict, super strict.

1158
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:45,620
There's a clock, like a little, I don't know if it's Arduino

1159
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:48,240
or Raspberry Pi based digital clock on the desk,

1160
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,040
which faces both you as the speaker

1161
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,160
and it faces the audience.

1162
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,460
So everyone knows whether you're going to overrun or not,

1163
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,020
and they don't let it happen.

1164
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:58,320
So it's very much kept to time.

1165
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,760
And so I went in the room that I was going to be in,

1166
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,220
that I was giving my talk in a few talks ahead of time.

1167
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,880
So I was well prepared and I could make sure my slides worked

1168
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,040
and laptop worked and all that kind of stuff.

1169
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,960
And I learned some things.

1170
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,320
For example, there was a lightning talk

1171
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,160
about an application called Monica

1172
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,760
that I had never heard of.

1173
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,320
And I'm sure most people haven't heard of it.

1174
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,080
And it's a thing I totally need

1175
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,320
and I never knew I needed it.

1176
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:27,040
It's like a personal relationship manager, they call it.

1177
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,920
It's a database in which you can put all your memories,

1178
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:34,080
like remembering who that cousin is married to

1179
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,640
and what the names of their children are.

1180
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,620
And when was the last time you went out with this person

1181
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:40,840
and when's so-and-so's anniversary

1182
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,400
and all those things that you try and keep in your head

1183
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,240
and you forget.

1184
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,820
And you know, like when you get old, you forget that stuff.

1185
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:49,840
And it's all local, it's all stored internally.

1186
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,100
It's never meant to be shared.

1187
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,920
It's not like Facebook, it's not social network.

1188
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,920
It's just a little bit.

1189
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:56,920
And I'd never heard of this.

1190
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,280
And the guy gave a lightning talk before I went on.

1191
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,880
And I was like, this is fantastic.

1192
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,600
This is exactly why I come to FOSDEM

1193
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,560
because learn about stuff

1194
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:06,240
that I would never discover otherwise, it was brilliant.

1195
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,040
And then I gave a lightning talk and it was all right.

1196
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,400
So yeah, it was good.

1197
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,980
Now, do you have to, so you have to,

1198
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:11,820
for the lightning talks,

1199
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:13,800
is it like you have to stick to the 15 minutes no more?

1200
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:14,900
Is it 10 minutes?

1201
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,480
Yeah, it's 15 minutes and then a five-minute changeover.

1202
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,200
So you got an ability way to get off the stage

1203
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,000
and get back on and the next one to get on.

1204
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,380
I burned through my slides in about 10 minutes

1205
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,880
and left time for questions

1206
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:29,280
because whenever I talk about snaps and SnapCraft,

1207
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,520
there are always questions.

1208
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,920
It's never like, oh, that was interesting.

1209
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,320
And then everyone gets up and leaves.

1210
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,740
What's the most common,

1211
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:35,940
like when you're in a group setting,

1212
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,040
what's the most common one?

1213
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,780
So usually there's something about security,

1214
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:42,640
something about the fact that you're bundling libraries in

1215
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,960
and who's responsible for security.

1216
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,480
So that question came up.

1217
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:47,680
There was a question this time

1218
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,680
about parallel installs of snaps,

1219
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:53,200
like having multiple snaps of different versions

1220
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,580
on the system.

1221
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,760
And I didn't realize that that feature

1222
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,960
has actually landed like this weekend.

1223
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,360
So I said, oh, it's coming and it's actually all right.

1224
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,200
That worked out.

1225
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,920
And then there was the inevitable question I always get

1226
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,920
is how does this compare to Flatpak?

1227
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:09,760
Which like, please, could you compare this to Flatpak?

1228
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,600
And I had two and a half minutes left on the clock

1229
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,440
and I was like, no,

1230
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,920
I'm not gonna compare them in two and a half minutes.

1231
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:17,280
So yeah, I kind of ducked that one,

1232
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,400
but it was really, really good.

1233
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,360
Really, really good.

1234
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,040
That does make me wanna make sure I try to get it

1235
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,800
to a FOSDEM 2020.

1236
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,480
Wow, 2020, geez, that's crazy.

1237
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,540
Yeah, it's the 20th one next year, I think.

1238
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:30,920
Joe always says it's the worst time of year to travel though

1239
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,320
because everybody's sick.

1240
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,840
Did you manage to avoid the con crud?

1241
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,640
I haven't come down with anything yet.

1242
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,560
I did notice a few likely patient zeros

1243
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,520
who were kind enough not to shake my hand

1244
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,080
and they realized they were patient zero

1245
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,560
and didn't wanna spread it.

1246
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:48,440
But you know, it's very difficult

1247
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:49,760
when you're in a room full of people.

1248
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,960
But the travel, I went on the Eurostar.

1249
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,760
So I just get a train from my place to London,

1250
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,160
which is like 45 minutes and then cross London,

1251
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,240
it's like 20 minutes on the underground

1252
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,640
and then get on the Eurostar

1253
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,240
and it's a train direct from London

1254
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,840
all the way through the Channel Tunnel,

1255
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,080
through France, into Belgium,

1256
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:11,360
get out, quick cab ride or bus or tram

1257
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,680
and you're at the hotel, it's fantastic.

1258
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:17,000
It's a great way, if you're coming from where my house,

1259
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,520
it's great.

1260
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,440
If you're coming from where you are, Chris,

1261
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,560
maybe not so much.

1262
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:24,200
Yeah, no, no, it's not.

1263
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,960
It's a slight distance difference, I guess.

1264
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,440
It's also important to understand

1265
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,160
that Joe is something of a delicate flower

1266
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,880
when it comes to conference attendance

1267
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,400
and getting sick and being concerned about getting sick.

1268
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,200
So you need to bear that in mind as well.

1269
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,520
Hey, as the boss, I gotta respect the fact

1270
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:41,080
that the man wants to make sure his voice is functional

1271
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,200
because I got a lot of shows that go out of business

1272
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,880
if he's too sick.

1273
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,760
Also, he is a bit taller than me

1274
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,600
and he is a bit cramped on the Eurostar

1275
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,760
unless you're able to play a little bit extra.

1276
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,080
Actually, the fact that Chris has never met Joe,

1277
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,920
it's gonna be interesting to see that first encounter

1278
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:02,640
when Chris is staring squarely at Joe's navel

1279
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,040
when they meet for the first time.

1280
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:04,880
Yes.

1281
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,360
Brent, you had a great question to ask Poppy.

1282
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,400
Yeah, my question actually was

1283
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:13,800
with Linux Fest Northwest coming up.

1284
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,080
I know it's the 20th anniversary

1285
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,560
and I just wondered if you think that the rooms

1286
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:22,560
will be just as packed with how it's the 20th anniversary

1287
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,000
and how that's gonna affect sort of that closeness

1288
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,560
that it feels like at Linux Fest Northwest.

1289
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,400
That's one for you, Chris.

1290
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,240
I've never been to Linux Fest Northwest.

1291
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,200
This is my first time.

1292
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,400
You'll be able to answer, won't you, soon?

1293
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,680
Yeah, yeah, totally.

1294
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,080
I think what your answer would be,

1295
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,400
and I'm just gonna guess,

1296
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,800
it would be great if we could remember to go back to this,

1297
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,480
but I think what your answer would be, Poppy,

1298
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,040
is that the size is much more manageable

1299
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,000
at Linux Fest Northwest.

1300
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,240
You can find a seat,

1301
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,680
you can make your way to a talk in time,

1302
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,400
but there's just also not gonna be necessarily

1303
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,520
all of the same selection.

1304
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,040
And that's the tricky part about some of these

1305
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,240
is the thing about FOSDEM is it's kind of a unique event

1306
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,840
in the sense that there's some folks

1307
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:01,520
that only make the trip to FOSDEM,

1308
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,360
just like there's some folks

1309
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,840
that only make the trip to Linux Fest

1310
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:04,960
or only make the trip to Scale.

1311
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,200
That's why they're all unique.

1312
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,280
Same with all the different events.

1313
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,720
So I bet that would be your takeaway,

1314
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,440
but I might be wrong.

1315
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,680
I don't wanna put words in your mouth.

1316
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,200
Yeah, Chris, I think the crux of my question

1317
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:19,520
is judging by how last year was pretty full

1318
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,960
and this year there's, only in this chat room,

1319
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:22,960
there's a bunch of people coming

1320
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,880
for the first time from overseas.

1321
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,440
I know, we're freaking a big crowd this year.

1322
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,440
Is that an indicator of what might happen, right?

1323
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,680
I mean, I hope so.

1324
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:33,120
The Bellingham Technical College is a large campus

1325
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,560
and they've been very generous.

1326
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:37,480
Perhaps they'd open up more space, more space in the future.

1327
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:38,320
You know what they need to do

1328
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,480
is they need to adopt a policy like FOSDEM has.

1329
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,000
Out of all of the events I've gone to,

1330
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I've never heard this line before.

1331
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,880
Please also make sure to clean up after yourselves.

1332
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,560
Like, that's, that's fantastic.

1333
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,160
Yeah, us nerds, we're not always the cleanliest people,

1334
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,080
are we?

1335
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:58,040
Yeah, and because you can buy beer and Club Marte,

1336
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,120
there's always glasses clinking around

1337
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,080
as people are like moving in and out of the room.

1338
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,440
As people put the glass down on the floor,

1339
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,280
there's nowhere else to put it.

1340
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:07,200
I've just put an image in IRC

1341
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,160
you might want to have a look at.

1342
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,920
It's, you can find this yourself

1343
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:14,240
if you do an online search for FOSDEM Richard Stallman

1344
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,560
preaching to the converted, I think the image is called.

1345
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:21,560
And it's a panorama of the main room, Jansen.

1346
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:23,560
And so that room, that photo,

1347
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,680
if you go and find it is from 2005 and it's Richard Stallman.

1348
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:29,160
I was there, I'm right at the back of that picture.

1349
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,880
And when Mad Dog was there this year,

1350
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,440
you imagine every single one of those seats full.

1351
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:39,000
This room isn't full in 2005, all of that full

1352
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,840
and people all the way up the stairs either side

1353
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,400
and sat around the front as well.

1354
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,240
It was mad.

1355
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,280
I will put a link to the 2005 photo in the show notes

1356
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,960
so people want to compare.

1357
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,440
Yeah, you're right, that's a good point.

1358
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,680
I think when it's a community event,

1359
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:57,600
it also leaves room for slight rough edges.

1360
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,280
Going back to the cleanup thing, I laugh,

1361
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:03,200
but they have a real community attitude about it.

1362
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,560
We have to pack up tomorrow in about two hours time.

1363
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,760
We have to be out of the buildings

1364
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,760
come nine o'clock tomorrow evening.

1365
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,640
So there's not a lot of time to do the cleanup.

1366
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,040
If you do the bulk of the work,

1367
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,680
that leaves less work for us.

1368
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:21,120
So we'd be very grateful if you would do that.

1369
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,640
It's not only is it something

1370
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,120
that you just wouldn't really hear in the States,

1371
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:26,160
like there's their general attitude about the event.

1372
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,520
It's not the same attitude that you have here in the States.

1373
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,160
So it's different in that regard,

1374
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,080
but it really does have that community feeling to it,

1375
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:34,120
even watching from afar.

1376
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,960
So thank you, Mr. Proby for the recap.

1377
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:39,360
I love living vicariously through you.

1378
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,920
I wish I could have made it.

1379
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,440
Well, I would encourage your listeners,

1380
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:44,440
if you get an opportunity next year,

1381
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,520
you might want to book early to avoid disappointment.

1382
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:47,840
You don't have to pay for tickets, by the way,

1383
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,760
it's completely free event.

1384
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,200
You can, it's just got to pay for your travel

1385
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,600
and accommodation, but book early,

1386
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:56,280
because I suspect it's going to be even more full next year.

1387
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,560
So you might want to make sure you can get accommodation

1388
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,600
and all that stuff at a time

1389
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,240
and look out for the announcement

1390
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,720
when that comes later in the year.

1391
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:05,800
Very good.

1392
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,200
Let's take a moment in the show now

1393
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,640
and talk about the new release of Pi-Hole.

1394
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:14,760
Pi-Hole version 4.2 is now available with shared memory,

1395
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:18,000
new blocking modes, and much, much more.

1396
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,480
And Mr. Wes and I were chatting before the show.

1397
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,320
We said, this is it.

1398
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:22,800
This is now our chance.

1399
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:23,920
Talk about Pi-Hole.

1400
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,600
And you did a deep dive, Wes.

1401
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,920
You went all in into the Pi-Hole.

1402
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,600
Oh yeah, I'm stuck down in there now.

1403
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,480
It's running on my laptop.

1404
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,480
It's running on my network.

1405
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,040
I can't escape.

1406
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,200
So did you really?

1407
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,360
Okay, so you did a laptop install.

1408
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,360
I mean, not to throw us off course here,

1409
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,680
but maybe that's not a bad place to start.

1410
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,080
Like this isn't actually something

1411
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,000
you have to install on a Raspberry Pi.

1412
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,360
I think everybody knows that,

1413
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,440
but this is proof positive right here.

1414
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:51,200
Yeah, it's kind of a little bit different of a project

1415
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,360
because it doesn't come on like an SD card

1416
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,720
that you just flash and stick into your Pi.

1417
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,400
It's really just an installer script.

1418
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,000
So they have a set of supported operating systems.

1419
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,560
And honestly, it's pretty wide.

1420
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:04,520
Raspbian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, CentOS even.

1421
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:07,040
And on most of those, they also support ARM.

1422
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,120
So whether you wanna use the script

1423
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:11,480
on your Raspberry Pi or on your server,

1424
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,680
it doesn't really matter.

1425
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,280
It just sets everything up the same.

1426
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:19,280
Yeah, so Pi-Hole is a network-wide

1427
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:23,600
DNS-based advertising blocking appliance.

1428
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,240
It uses several different technologies like DNS mask,

1429
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,720
which is a lightweight DNS server.

1430
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,440
It can also do DHCP.

1431
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,320
Uses curl for transferring data

1432
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,360
with different URL syntaxes between things.

1433
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:36,200
HTTP D for the web server to manage it.

1434
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,200
PHP, which is the web interface I believe is written in.

1435
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:44,120
And the admin dashboard is based on admin LTE.

1436
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,480
All of that sits on top of Linux.

1437
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,400
Using these open-source technologies

1438
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,880
to intercept DNS requests and use what's called,

1439
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,200
I think the Pi-Hole comes from DNS black-holing of things.

1440
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,600
Wes, that's where the name comes from.

1441
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,040
It's essentially a DNS black-hole

1442
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:02,600
for things like ad sites and malware and whatnot.

1443
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:03,440
Yeah, exactly.

1444
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,600
So usually what you do is you install on a Pi

1445
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,840
or in a VM or a container.

1446
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,240
Or sync-holing, sync-holing.

1447
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,160
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1448
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,920
And so once you've done that,

1449
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,720
you usually update your router to push a DHCP option

1450
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,000
that says like, hey, go use this for DNS.

1451
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Or you could obviously go manually edit

1452
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,560
your DNS configuration on whatever client you wanna use.

1453
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:23,560
Right, you do have to adjust your client DNS.

1454
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:24,760
That's a good point to mention, right?

1455
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,400
Because otherwise, if you're not doing it the DHCP level,

1456
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,000
then you need to go adjust the DNS

1457
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,200
at anything that you want to use this thing.

1458
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,040
Yeah, exactly.

1459
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,440
Go point it at whatever IP you've given

1460
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:34,880
wherever you installed it.

1461
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,840
And then from there, it's got a modified,

1462
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:39,800
a forked version of DNS mask that it's using

1463
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,920
to go block all these things you can load in.

1464
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,800
Honestly, the web UI, it's pretty decent.

1465
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,600
They've got these fun little glowing counters.

1466
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,160
So every time it blocks a new request,

1467
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:48,760
you get, you see that kind of count up

1468
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:52,080
and you're like, oh yeah, more ads that got killed.

1469
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:52,960
And it makes it easy too.

1470
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,200
Like you could do this, obviously,

1471
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,320
I mean, I run DNS mask.

1472
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:58,200
I'm sure many of our listeners do for exactly those things,

1473
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:02,000
DHCP, DNS, but their forked version's got some improvements.

1474
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,400
And with the web UI, it makes it really easy

1475
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,200
to go manage what block list you're using,

1476
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,040
kind of tweak that.

1477
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,120
Cause maybe you, maybe you're really privacy conscious

1478
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,200
and you want to block every single thing from Facebook,

1479
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,720
all their IP space, anything,

1480
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,560
even remotely associated with it.

1481
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:17,400
That works for some people, but kind of would hurt,

1482
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,600
you know, if your kids are on there

1483
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:21,520
or your family members, that's not gonna work.

1484
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,080
Yeah, well, if you use like, for example,

1485
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,400
there's a bunch of default lists

1486
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,520
that you can subscribe to during the installation.

1487
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:29,200
And when you subscribe to just those defaults,

1488
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,360
there's even parts of YouTube that don't render quite right.

1489
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:36,880
And there's not as much of a direct action as you can take

1490
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,960
when you're using an ad blocker in your web browser,

1491
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,200
cause you could just go to the toolbar

1492
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,520
and turn it off for a brief moment.

1493
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:44,760
Then the broken webpage renders properly.

1494
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,840
When you do it at the network level,

1495
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:49,800
there's a little more work involved to fix that.

1496
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,440
But the advantage is A, you don't have to install

1497
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:55,520
ad blocking software on the individual end machines,

1498
00:57:55,520 --> 00:58:00,280
but B, it's also preventing tracking and advertising

1499
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,480
on any of the devices on your network.

1500
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:06,240
So a smart television, your phones, your tablets,

1501
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,520
things that aren't web browsers

1502
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:10,160
that you can't install ad blocking extensions into

1503
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,800
can also be protected.

1504
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:16,240
And that's even more important now with smart televisions

1505
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,360
that basically ship from every manufacturer

1506
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:20,040
that monitor what you do.

1507
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,400
That's really nice.

1508
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,080
And it's not 100% peace of mind,

1509
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,720
but it's a bit more peace of mind.

1510
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:25,560
Well, that's a great point.

1511
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:27,840
I wouldn't, you know, I'm not gonna remove

1512
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,400
any of the like application specific ad blockers.

1513
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,680
Cause kinda like you said, you know,

1514
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,400
because they block it at a DNS level,

1515
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,880
you do sometimes see a space that was made for an ad

1516
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,680
that was supposed to be there, but doesn't load.

1517
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,280
So you don't see the ad, but it's not quite as seamless

1518
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:42,240
as some of the fancy ad blockers we have today.

1519
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,120
But with all the changes we've seen,

1520
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,560
browsers making some moves to make that harder,

1521
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,360
it's a nice fallback that you can have

1522
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,520
at the edge of your network.

1523
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,080
And like I said, if you just have,

1524
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:55,000
if you just have like a stock router

1525
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,560
that you got from your ISP,

1526
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:59,160
and you're not already managing your DNS and DHCP,

1527
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,800
and you're all interested, this is a great first step.

1528
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,320
Cause it's all the same technology under the hood

1529
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:06,040
with a nice interface to manage it.

1530
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:08,600
And even if the ad blocking isn't perfect,

1531
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,120
it still does those other services.

1532
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:12,240
So you only have something to gain.

1533
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:15,600
And there is a moderate performance improvement

1534
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,680
if you switch from checking a DNS lookup

1535
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,320
across the internet versus checking for that DNS lookup

1536
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,200
on your local LAN.

1537
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,280
It's just a faster response time.

1538
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,720
And DNS mass will start to catch those things.

1539
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:29,280
And then when another machine looks up google.com,

1540
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,640
it doesn't go all the way out to the internet or your ISP

1541
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:34,400
or Google DNS, it can just get it from your

1542
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,960
local DNS mass server.

1543
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,000
But I guess the skeptic in me

1544
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,840
would be listening to this right now.

1545
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:42,640
And I would challenge this, Wes, I would say,

1546
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:47,640
why not just use something like my own local files,

1547
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,440
like Etsy host and others where I could,

1548
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,200
I could create my own sinkholes.

1549
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:56,280
And I could essentially do what Pi-hole is doing

1550
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:58,400
just using my local configs.

1551
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,440
Yeah, you certainly could,

1552
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,120
but I honestly, I don't see you doing that.

1553
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:04,240
Whereas using the GUI for Pi-hole, you probably would.

1554
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,880
And you're always gonna have devices,

1555
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:07,560
maybe you're just trying out a new distro

1556
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:09,520
or you've opened something in incognito tab

1557
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:12,240
and you forgot to enable the specific ad blocker extension

1558
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:15,840
in incognito, will you still get all the benefits?

1559
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:19,000
So you could still do it, but like they have it pretty easy.

1560
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,400
People have a lot of scripts out there

1561
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,440
that have compatible blocking lists.

1562
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,400
And actually, Poppy makes a great point.

1563
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,920
You can also add whitelists if you're having trouble

1564
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:30,240
or you always wanna know like all the requests to work,

1565
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,400
always allow those.

1566
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,240
Yeah, I use Pi-hole at home.

1567
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:36,120
And one of the things we do is send out

1568
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:38,840
some marketing emails and we use a third party service.

1569
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,240
And unfortunately that's blocked by Pi-hole

1570
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:43,440
because for some reason people think that's spam.

1571
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,760
And I need to see those.

1572
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,160
And so I just whitelist that service on my Pi-hole

1573
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:49,200
so that I can see it.

1574
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,640
But the thing you won't do, I mean, you could,

1575
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:54,200
you could just go and put like these big lists

1576
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:57,560
of blocked hosts in your Etsy host file and you're done.

1577
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:58,720
Right, you could do that.

1578
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,400
But you've got to keep that up to date

1579
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,000
and Pi-hole has an automatic update system, right?

1580
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:07,240
Also Pi-hole has a really nice reporting system.

1581
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:09,560
So you can actually see the top blocked domains,

1582
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:12,640
the top rated domains, top clients on your network.

1583
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:15,120
So I can see which machines on my network

1584
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:18,720
are doing the most DNS requests and where they're going.

1585
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:22,400
And I can make decisions that can affect the decisions

1586
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,600
I make about the software that I install

1587
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,980
or services that I enable and what extra things

1588
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:30,280
I might want to take belt and braces to block.

1589
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:34,960
I think it's an amazing project and the guys behind it

1590
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,400
have the absolute best intentions for it.

1591
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:41,360
It's just such a wholesome project, it's fantastic.

1592
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:42,200
I love it.

1593
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,020
That's a great point.

1594
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:45,260
It is, I mean, kind of, it's just DNS mask on steroids,

1595
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:47,440
but with a whole bunch of supporting community members

1596
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,560
and a lot of active development.

1597
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:52,320
Chris, you also found, so like part of that is

1598
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:53,880
they've been working part of this update

1599
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:56,200
is using shared memory to make exporting

1600
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,480
all the statistics they gather more efficient.

1601
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,320
And then they're implementing a Rust API

1602
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:01,760
to just be able to grab that.

1603
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,800
Part of that means you can also have things

1604
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:07,220
like this neat little GTK control panel you found

1605
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:09,360
that'll show you all the things that you're blocking.

1606
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:10,640
Yeah, right there on your desktop,

1607
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:13,000
you can get the stats from your Pi-hole system.

1608
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:13,840
Oh, really?

1609
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:14,720
Yeah, isn't that neat?

1610
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,320
Yeah, it's a GTK Python app.

1611
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:17,840
I had no idea.

1612
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:19,400
I'm logged into the web admin tool

1613
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:20,640
and I look at the pretty graphs

1614
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:23,560
and I see spikes at certain times of the day

1615
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:24,840
when I know I've got cron jobs

1616
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,200
that are doing loads of busy stuff

1617
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,760
and I can see when the kids come home

1618
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,720
because all their devices, IP addresses start showing up

1619
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,120
and I can see they're all using YouTube

1620
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:35,320
and Snapchat and Instagram and all that kind of stuff.

1621
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:37,040
I just love it.

1622
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:39,040
And the web admin tool is nice.

1623
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:41,100
It's good enough, that's all you need.

1624
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:43,320
I just, I dropped a link to it in the IRC,

1625
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,520
but I'll also, I'll put a link to it in the show notes.

1626
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,000
Awesome, I'm totally getting that.

1627
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,520
Now, the other thing that I was curious about

1628
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:52,160
is we've gotten a lot of emails from the audience

1629
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:56,760
about using this in a FreeNAS VM or on a PF

1630
01:02:56,760 --> 01:03:01,040
or doing like a KVM box with PF sense in a VM,

1631
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:03,920
FreeNAS in a VM and Pi-Hole in a VM.

1632
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:07,240
And each one of these, obviously,

1633
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:08,440
each one of these use cases,

1634
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:10,080
they're not using a Raspberry Pi at all,

1635
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:13,420
but they're taking advantage of the automated installation

1636
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:14,560
where it walks you through

1637
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:15,920
how to get all the subscriptions,

1638
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,880
how to just set all that up.

1639
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:20,520
And obviously they're taking advantage of the updates.

1640
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:22,640
And it's still a very much like an appliance.

1641
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,360
So you don't have to run it on a Raspberry Pi,

1642
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:25,480
but you can just get the image

1643
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:28,320
and then flash it to the Raspberry Pi.

1644
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,000
But they've also now started shipping it

1645
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,620
as a Docker container as well.

1646
01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:34,600
That's what I'm using to run it on my laptop.

1647
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:35,800
And honestly, it works pretty well.

1648
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:38,140
You gotta go fiddle with a few environmental variables

1649
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:39,880
and supply those with your like,

1650
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:42,200
the IP address of the machine that Docker is running on,

1651
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,040
stuff like that.

1652
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:45,020
But honestly, they have decent instructions

1653
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:46,160
and it just works.

1654
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,200
Now do be aware,

1655
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,120
they've only recently got the cadence switch

1656
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:50,720
so that when new releases come out,

1657
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,500
new Docker builds are available,

1658
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,080
but the Docker files aren't that complicated.

1659
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,260
You can build it yourself.

1660
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:56,780
And the kind of the question

1661
01:03:56,780 --> 01:03:58,480
when you look at all of those emails that came in,

1662
01:03:58,480 --> 01:03:59,320
the core of it is,

1663
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:01,240
could this work for an enterprise LAN?

1664
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:03,380
And when you look at the underlying technology

1665
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:05,200
like DNS mask and whatnot,

1666
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,360
it absolutely holds up.

1667
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:07,980
It really just depends on the resources

1668
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:09,040
of the machines you deploy it on.

1669
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:10,880
You could absolutely use this

1670
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,440
to provide ad blocking and malware blocking

1671
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:16,760
across an entire LAN of employees.

1672
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,880
I think you could certainly test it out

1673
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:21,440
on a subset of your estate,

1674
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:23,920
like try out on the techies first

1675
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:27,880
and then add this to your DHCP leases

1676
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:31,020
for some parts of your user base

1677
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:32,320
and slowly roll it out.

1678
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:33,880
And as you add departments,

1679
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:34,760
you'd find,

1680
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:36,660
oh, well, so-and-so in accounts

1681
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:37,800
needs access to this thing

1682
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,760
and we need to add a white list for that.

1683
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,640
So I certainly think if you rolled it out

1684
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,200
in a managed way,

1685
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,600
you could use something like this, definitely.

1686
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:46,440
Yeah, you could just,

1687
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,120
initially a handful of users

1688
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,640
where you switch their DNS manually

1689
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:53,200
and just see how that goes for even one lease cycle

1690
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,240
of the DHCP lease.

1691
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:55,840
You could just see what happens.

1692
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,160
And the admin is really easy.

1693
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:58,060
While I've been talking to you,

1694
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,280
I remembered, oh, I haven't updated it for a while.

1695
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:01,760
So I just SSHed into my Pi

1696
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,280
and ran Pi-hole-up

1697
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,120
and it's updated while I'm talking to you.

1698
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:06,560
It's brilliant.

1699
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:07,620
That's cool.

1700
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:09,640
So what do you think, Wes,

1701
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:11,120
after trying it out for the show,

1702
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:13,280
are you gonna stick with it at the home network?

1703
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,120
Yeah, I think so.

1704
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:16,120
I mean, I really don't see why not.

1705
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:19,000
I've been doing some rebuilding in the home network anyway,

1706
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
simplifying things.

1707
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,040
And I like having, right now,

1708
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:23,400
my DNS and routing stuff

1709
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,160
is a little too commingled for my tastes.

1710
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,740
And if I can have an appliance that does the same thing,

1711
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:28,580
I'm in.

1712
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:30,160
Mm, I like that.

1713
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,560
We'll have some of Wes's notes

1714
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:34,960
linked in our Linux Unplug blog,

1715
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:38,320
which is linked up at the top of linuxunplug.com site.

1716
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:40,020
And he's got information here

1717
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:42,040
about versions that they officially support

1718
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,520
that aren't on Raspberry Pi on there,

1719
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,200
whitelist, blacklist information,

1720
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,000
how to run the Docker container,

1721
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:49,520
how to add additional block lists,

1722
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:50,840
how to just grab the PyHole installer

1723
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:53,040
and run it on your own Linux, all of that.

1724
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:55,320
So that, as well as additional resources,

1725
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,960
are linked in the show notes.

1726
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,820
And please do let us know your experiences with it.

1727
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:00,200
I know it's been around for a while.

1728
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,960
It's on us that we haven't talked about it, really.

1729
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:02,800
That's our bad.

1730
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,040
And so this was our chance to do it.

1731
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:08,300
Let us know your experiences, linuxunplug.com slash contact.

1732
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:09,480
And I don't know, Mr. Payne,

1733
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:11,940
is there anything else we should relay about PyHole

1734
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:13,520
and the new version 4.2?

1735
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:14,620
No, it's really easy.

1736
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:16,320
If you're interested in trying it out,

1737
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:17,640
there's no reason not to.

1738
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,200
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1739
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:22,240
Yeah, it gets the Linux Unplug seal of approval.

1740
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:23,960
And I have a sense we'll be talking about more

1741
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:24,800
in the post-show.

1742
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,920
But I do wanna head out of here with an app pick.

1743
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:31,320
It's great to see it if you've decided to spend the money,

1744
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:35,560
like Mr. Wimper's has, on a nice, fancy Nvidia card.

1745
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:37,740
And you look over at the folks on Windows

1746
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:40,520
and you see them with their graphical overclocking tools.

1747
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:43,080
And you think to yourself, why?

1748
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:44,180
Why can't I have that?

1749
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:46,520
I am green with envy.

1750
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:47,540
Well, I have good news for you

1751
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:49,080
because that is a new tool designed

1752
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:52,080
to let you manage your fans, your CPU,

1753
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:55,760
I guess the GPU of your Nvidia card under Linux.

1754
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:58,720
And it's literally called Green with Envy.

1755
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,880
And Joey has a great write-up with some screenshots

1756
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:04,200
over at omgabuntu.co.uk if you wanna check it out.

1757
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:07,120
You'll generally get general CPU stats,

1758
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:10,440
I'm sorry, GPU stats, power, clock information,

1759
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:14,080
like the rate, GPU temperature, the fan speed.

1760
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:16,760
You can set up custom fan profiles.

1761
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:18,180
You can view historical data.

1762
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:21,480
And yes, yes, you can overclock.

1763
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:23,920
Finally, Mr. Wimperis, are you gonna give this a go?

1764
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:27,280
No, cause it's easier to do through the API and the script.

1765
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,520
Oh, okay.

1766
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:31,840
So I've already put the effort in.

1767
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:34,880
Yeah, I've got a script and yeah.

1768
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:38,180
I mean, certainly having a GUI is a great thing, right?

1769
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:39,960
Because when you buy the Nvidia cards

1770
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:42,320
and you get your Windows drivers from insert name

1771
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:44,920
of board partner of Nvidia,

1772
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:48,680
they have their own skin on top of the drivers

1773
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:52,120
and their own overclocking utilities.

1774
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:55,080
And they're all pushing the same parameters around.

1775
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:58,400
It's all about clock speed, memory frequency,

1776
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,000
fan profile and power limit.

1777
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,240
They're basically the four things that you can tweak.

1778
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:05,360
So, and you can do that through Nvidia settings

1779
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:07,840
and Nvidia SMI and stuff like that.

1780
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:12,440
But having a GUI, which reproduces the custom UIs

1781
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:15,040
that you see on these board partners, Windows drivers

1782
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:15,880
is no bad thing.

1783
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:18,120
And it's a little bit more computing parity

1784
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:19,560
for Linux users.

1785
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:20,400
Yep.

1786
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:21,240
Completely agree.

1787
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:23,200
I don't actually think I'm going to do it,

1788
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,560
but I'd love to see it.

1789
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:25,640
Oh, you should totally do it.

1790
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:26,480
Really?

1791
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:28,440
Oh, I'm squeezing tons more performance

1792
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:30,680
out of my 1080 Ti with this.

1793
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:31,520
Really?

1794
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:32,340
It's astonishing.

1795
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:36,480
Yeah, I've got over a gigahertz memory clock uplift

1796
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:38,400
on my 1080 Ti.

1797
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:43,400
And I think between 350 and 500 megahertz core clock,

1798
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:46,720
and that requires that you up the power limit.

1799
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:50,440
So the power governor for Nvidia cards is quite constrained.

1800
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:52,520
And so you push the power limit up,

1801
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:55,520
which means you can push more juice into the card

1802
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:58,720
in order to support those clock and memory frequencies.

1803
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:00,000
And then of course, to do that,

1804
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,840
you then need to configure the fan profile

1805
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:04,480
to make sure you don't burn the thing out.

1806
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:06,200
So yeah, all the tools are there.

1807
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:09,000
Not even sure if my GPU doc has a fan.

1808
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:14,040
So what I have discovered is if you've got

1809
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:16,960
mobile Nvidia things,

1810
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:20,240
so the sort of the M series from the nine,

1811
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:22,320
you know, the nine series and the 10 series

1812
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:25,160
and the max Q stuff.

1813
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:27,880
So far, I've only got a few of those available to me.

1814
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:31,400
So far, you're not able to overclock those.

1815
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:34,080
Even if you turn on all the magic bits

1816
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:35,760
to strictly enable that,

1817
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:38,040
when you actually try and poke at those values,

1818
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:39,720
they all come back as their read only

1819
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:41,480
and you can't actually change them.

1820
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:45,840
So question for the audience,

1821
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:49,400
have you got a max Q or a mobile series Nvidia chipset

1822
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:50,960
and have you figured out how to overclock it?

1823
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:53,600
If so, come and join us next week and tell us how.

1824
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:54,520
Tell us how to do that.

1825
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:56,200
That would be really good to know.

1826
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:58,240
Well, all right.

1827
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:01,320
So hey, while I've got you for a moment,

1828
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:03,240
I saw there was a flash update

1829
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:05,200
over on the Ubuntu podcast feeds,

1830
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:08,800
a flash podcast with a very important announcement

1831
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:13,800
about a community meetup on March 16th, that's a Saturday.

1832
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:15,360
What do people need to know?

1833
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,120
Yeah, we're breaking with tradition a little bit

1834
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:19,000
this year on the Ubuntu podcast

1835
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:24,000
and we're gonna have a listener get together

1836
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:28,760
ahead of the next season to have a chat with the listeners,

1837
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:31,160
find out what they like, what they like to hear more of

1838
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:36,160
and use their feedback to go into our curry meetup

1839
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:40,320
where we decide what we're gonna do for the coming year.

1840
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:45,320
So yeah, it's gonna be in Reading in the UK on March 16th.

1841
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:48,200
If you go to, oh goodness,

1842
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:49,920
if you go to ubuntupodcast.org

1843
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,040
and look at the most recent episode,

1844
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:54,400
all of the links to where you need to go to sign up

1845
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:55,800
and register to that event are there,

1846
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:58,480
but we're currently sorting out the final location

1847
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,800
at the moment and details will be posted soon.

1848
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:01,720
Very good.

1849
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:05,040
Speaking of March, we will be at scale,

1850
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:08,320
scale 17X, March 7th through the 10th.

1851
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,760
Mr. Payne, Al and myself will be there.

1852
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:12,440
Any of your friends from Canonical

1853
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:15,080
going to scale this year, gentlemen?

1854
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:16,720
Maybe. Yes.

1855
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:18,560
Yes, certainly people are going.

1856
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:21,120
We're just trying to figure out who is going.

1857
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,120
We'll let you know.

1858
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:23,000
Oh, very good.

1859
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,040
Well, there you have it.

1860
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:27,520
Last minute updates here on the Unplugged program.

1861
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,040
We start with breaking news

1862
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:33,800
and we end with in-development last minute updates.

1863
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:36,840
So ubuntupodcast.org for more information on that.

1864
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:39,720
Go join Wes Payne and Jim Salter

1865
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:43,200
on the revamped TechSnap show Better Than Ever

1866
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:46,280
with new details about ZFS rebasing on Linux

1867
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:47,880
and much, much more.

1868
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:49,640
Where can they find you on Twitter, Mr. Payne?

1869
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:51,200
I'm at Wes Payne.

1870
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:53,240
Beautiful, I am at Chris LAS.

1871
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:55,520
The whole network is at Jupiter Signal.

1872
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,960
If you're listening live, stick around

1873
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:58,520
because we're about to kick off

1874
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:00,120
our first ever study group.

1875
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:01,880
I am super excited about that.

1876
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:03,920
If you want to know more about when we're doing those

1877
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:07,480
and other kinds of meetups online or in person,

1878
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:10,280
you can go to meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting

1879
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:11,120
for all of those.

1880
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:12,480
Thank you so much for joining us

1881
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,880
and we'll see you back here next Tuesday.

1882
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:32,880
I really do appreciate your time with us.

1883
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:53,580
well thank you everybody for joining us thank you mumble room for being here

1884
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:57,860
enjoyed that show that was amazing and boy look at the size of that mumble room

1885
01:12:57,860 --> 01:13:02,160
it's just warms my heart it's huge it's great so the link that Martin couldn't

1886
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:08,260
remember is get together dot community it's a website that Michael Hall ex

1887
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:11,780
community manager at the canonical and now works for the Linux Foundation on

1888
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:16,580
Ajax foundry he has created this in his spare time it's like a an alternative

1889
01:13:16,580 --> 01:13:20,540
free software alternative to meet up oh that's great that is really really good

1890
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:26,200
what is it again get together dot community have you seen I I don't know

1891
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:30,800
if you how much you've plugged around in the Linux fest Northwest website but

1892
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:36,640
that is a whole event system that was created by the open Sousa folks like

1893
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:42,100
it's a whole CMS for events it's MIT licensed and it's up on github Wow yeah

1894
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:46,960
it's called OS EM and it's on the open Sousa github reports the open source

1895
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:50,040
event manager an event management tool tailored to free and open source

1896
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:54,360
software conferences so it does like the the speaker papers so all of us that

1897
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:57,640
have submitted talks it's you're using that system for people that are just

1898
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:07,360
registering to go the whole thing's an open source platform it's pretty neat
