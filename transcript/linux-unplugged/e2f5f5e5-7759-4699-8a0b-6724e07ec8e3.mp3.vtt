00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Every now and then, I see a post on Reddit

00:02.000 --> 00:05.440
that makes me feel like an inadequate human being.

00:05.440 --> 00:07.760
This post is one of those that I don't think

00:07.760 --> 00:10.720
in my entire life, if I lived another 70 years,

00:10.720 --> 00:14.160
another 80 years, if I lived to be 180,

00:14.160 --> 00:16.160
I could never accomplish this.

00:16.160 --> 00:18.940
This guy made his own smartwatch

00:18.940 --> 00:22.100
from like 3D printed wood or something.

00:22.100 --> 00:22.940
Did you see this?

00:22.940 --> 00:23.760
Yeah, it's incredible.

00:23.760 --> 00:24.980
And that was my first thought too.

00:24.980 --> 00:26.860
In no way will I ever do this.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.620
Wait, you could 3D print wood?

00:28.620 --> 00:30.320
Well, it's like a wood composite.

00:30.320 --> 00:31.600
It's like a mixture.

00:31.600 --> 00:33.900
It is one handsome smartwatch though.

00:33.900 --> 00:34.720
Yeah.

00:34.720 --> 00:36.800
Yeah, you put sawdust in with the plastic filament

00:36.800 --> 00:39.920
and it kind of comes out as like a wood filler.

00:39.920 --> 00:42.220
Oh, so it's got like a grain and stuff.

00:42.220 --> 00:43.160
Yeah, oh, for sure.

00:43.160 --> 00:45.420
Yeah, it looks like a nice wooden watch.

00:45.420 --> 00:48.360
It's a round one that he built himself

00:48.360 --> 00:50.920
and he has all of the models and specs up on Imgur.

00:50.920 --> 00:52.120
Even the printing process,

00:52.120 --> 00:54.820
you can actually watch it get printed.

00:54.820 --> 00:56.700
Yeah, the other impressive part to me is I assume like,

00:56.700 --> 00:58.360
okay, it's gonna put some sort of Android

00:58.360 --> 00:59.400
or some other common platform,

00:59.400 --> 01:01.560
but no, it looks like he wrote all the software himself

01:01.560 --> 01:02.400
in C.

01:02.400 --> 01:05.080
And is it GNU slash Linux?

01:05.080 --> 01:06.240
Let's just say it is.

01:06.240 --> 01:07.080
You wanna just say it is?

01:07.080 --> 01:08.240
No, I think it's all just running on an embedded device.

01:08.240 --> 01:09.740
No, I'm pretty sure it's GNU slash Linux.

01:09.740 --> 01:11.100
Yeah, I'm pretty sure, Wes.

01:11.100 --> 01:12.600
Yeah.

01:12.600 --> 01:16.120
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 300,

01:16.120 --> 01:19.600
recorded early on May 2nd, 2019.

01:19.600 --> 01:33.080
Well, hey there, welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

01:33.080 --> 01:34.160
My name is Chris.

01:34.160 --> 01:35.160
My name is Wes.

01:35.160 --> 01:38.360
Hello, Mr. Payne, looking dapper in that vest as always.

01:38.360 --> 01:39.360
Oh, thank you.

01:39.360 --> 01:41.440
Let's take a moment right here at the top of the show

01:41.440 --> 01:46.480
and welcome the newbie, our brand new editor.

01:46.480 --> 01:47.480
It's Drew.

01:47.480 --> 01:48.480
Hello, Drew.

01:48.480 --> 01:49.480
Hello, hello.

01:49.480 --> 01:51.520
How do you feel over there coming in?

01:51.520 --> 01:52.520
Great.

01:52.520 --> 01:53.520
It is wonderful to be here.

01:53.520 --> 01:54.520
It's nice to have you here.

01:54.520 --> 01:56.080
Yeah, Drew is our second editor now.

01:56.080 --> 01:58.040
Of course, Joe isn't going anywhere.

01:58.040 --> 02:00.840
Now we are a team with two editors.

02:00.840 --> 02:02.240
Man, we have editing superpowers,

02:02.240 --> 02:04.480
so we have no excuse for bad audio.

02:04.480 --> 02:05.480
I know.

02:05.480 --> 02:08.600
Oh, crap, maybe we shouldn't say that, actually.

02:08.600 --> 02:11.160
And of course, joining me as always here in the studio

02:11.160 --> 02:12.160
is our crew.

02:12.160 --> 02:13.160
Hello, cheese.

02:13.160 --> 02:14.160
Hey, what's going on, man?

02:14.160 --> 02:15.160
How's it going?

02:15.160 --> 02:16.160
Brock's in the front of the line.

02:16.160 --> 02:17.720
Brock's in the front of the line, man.

02:17.720 --> 02:18.720
You know it, baby.

02:18.720 --> 02:19.720
You know it.

02:19.720 --> 02:23.320
Now, also joining us in studio, the one, the only, Joe Rezington.

02:23.320 --> 02:24.320
Hello, Joe.

02:24.320 --> 02:25.320
Hello.

02:25.320 --> 02:26.320
Hello.

02:26.320 --> 02:27.320
Hello, sir.

02:27.320 --> 02:28.320
How are you doing over there?

02:28.320 --> 02:29.320
You feeling better?

02:29.320 --> 02:30.320
Yeah, mostly.

02:30.320 --> 02:32.000
Still a little bit jet lagged, but happy to have Drew on board

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
taking some of the load.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.720
Yeah, it came in at a good time because-

02:34.720 --> 02:36.720
I mean, you were working crazy hours.

02:36.720 --> 02:38.840
Like, we don't want Joe to kill himself.

02:38.840 --> 02:40.400
We got to take some of the load off.

02:40.400 --> 02:41.560
Yeah, absolutely.

02:41.560 --> 02:44.040
And also very happy to have Alex here.

02:44.040 --> 02:45.040
Hello, Alex.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.040
Hello.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.040
Hello, Mr. Badger.

02:47.040 --> 02:48.280
Good to have you on board as well,

02:48.280 --> 02:50.040
especially for today's topic.

02:50.040 --> 02:52.520
We'll talk about many, many things in today's podcast

02:52.520 --> 02:56.100
as we are one to do, as we are one to do.

02:56.100 --> 02:57.800
But nominally, we wanted to have another shot

02:57.800 --> 02:59.840
at talking about Fedora 30.

02:59.840 --> 03:02.020
We had to give just a quick mention in last week's episode

03:02.020 --> 03:04.440
because our time had been focused on Linux Fest Northwest.

03:04.440 --> 03:07.040
And it was hot off the presses at the time.

03:07.040 --> 03:08.040
Right.

03:08.040 --> 03:11.720
But now we've had a little bit of chance to kick the tires.

03:11.720 --> 03:13.880
And we'll tell you about our perfect Fedora setups

03:13.880 --> 03:18.240
that we've landed on, as well as some really, really cool spins

03:18.240 --> 03:20.440
that I'd never had a chance to play around with before.

03:20.440 --> 03:24.240
And I used this release of Fedora as an excuse to do that.

03:24.240 --> 03:26.200
So I'll tell you about those as well.

03:26.200 --> 03:28.480
But we got to start things off with some community news.

03:28.480 --> 03:30.120
You know how we do, Wes.

03:30.120 --> 03:33.780
There was, I feel like a psychological thriller

03:33.780 --> 03:36.880
being played out by Red Hat against Linux users,

03:36.880 --> 03:40.160
like teasing us, tugging on our strings,

03:40.160 --> 03:42.240
telling us that a new logo was coming.

03:42.240 --> 03:45.860
And then it kind of landed, it sort of landed first

03:45.860 --> 03:48.080
as a community contest to sort of prep everybody

03:48.080 --> 03:49.760
that a logo change was coming.

03:49.760 --> 03:51.560
Get your feet wet, kind of understand

03:51.560 --> 03:52.600
that change is happening.

03:52.600 --> 03:53.620
Don't be too scared.

03:53.620 --> 03:55.960
And then you started seeing these posts on Reddit

03:55.960 --> 03:58.360
and whatnot that was like, the new logo is coming.

03:58.360 --> 04:01.280
What's it going to be like now that IBM has acquired Red Hat?

04:01.280 --> 04:02.720
They're changing the logo.

04:02.720 --> 04:03.840
Blue Hat, right?

04:03.840 --> 04:05.960
Yeah, is the hat going blue?

04:05.960 --> 04:08.000
And then we got the big announcement video

04:08.000 --> 04:12.200
from Red Hat with the cool, hip Red Hat music,

04:12.200 --> 04:15.600
showing the new logo in all these different contexts that

04:15.600 --> 04:20.020
are so awesome with flashy colors and hip people.

04:20.020 --> 04:21.480
How could you not love the new logo?

04:21.480 --> 04:26.940
Ladies and gentlemen, the new Red Hat logo is a Red Hat.

04:26.940 --> 04:28.600
Very controversial decision here.

04:28.600 --> 04:29.920
Who saw that coming?

04:29.920 --> 04:31.960
People seem to really miss Shadow Man, though.

04:31.960 --> 04:33.520
Yeah, Shadow Man is gone.

04:33.520 --> 04:34.800
That is the big difference.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.720
There are some good reasons for that, though.

04:36.720 --> 04:39.640
There were internal people whose entire job it

04:39.640 --> 04:41.840
is to look after the Red Hat brand, of course.

04:41.840 --> 04:45.960
And they ran polls to ask people what they thought

04:45.960 --> 04:48.720
when they saw the Red Hat logo, and word just sinister

04:48.720 --> 04:49.340
came up.

04:49.340 --> 04:50.800
And it's kind of in the name, right?

04:50.800 --> 04:52.280
Shadowy, Shadow Man.

04:52.280 --> 04:55.280
So that was part of the thought process of getting rid of him.

04:55.280 --> 04:57.380
Yeah, and I could absolutely see that being the case

04:57.380 --> 05:00.160
with a team of marketers sitting around saying,

05:00.160 --> 05:03.520
what is bad about our brand?

05:03.520 --> 05:06.240
How can we change it and bring it to a more positive light?

05:06.240 --> 05:08.680
But man, I really like the new logo.

05:08.680 --> 05:09.280
You know what?

05:09.280 --> 05:09.920
I do, too.

05:09.920 --> 05:11.520
Yeah, I do, too.

05:11.520 --> 05:14.320
I wasn't entirely convinced the first time I saw it.

05:14.320 --> 05:16.680
So there's been this internal project

05:16.680 --> 05:20.120
for, I don't know, the best part of a year, maybe longer,

05:20.120 --> 05:22.600
called the Open Brand Project, where they've basically

05:22.600 --> 05:26.720
crowdsourced this design from Red Hatters across the globe.

05:26.720 --> 05:30.640
And as you can imagine, Red Hat is full of opinionated people.

05:30.640 --> 05:32.520
So internal mailing lists have been lighting up

05:32.520 --> 05:35.080
for many months about this.

05:35.080 --> 05:36.680
And I can imagine.

05:36.680 --> 05:38.820
Everybody giving their two penneth about it.

05:38.820 --> 05:40.480
But I think they've done a great job.

05:40.480 --> 05:41.480
I think it looks great.

05:41.480 --> 05:43.280
I actually think it's the perfect move.

05:43.280 --> 05:46.040
Because everybody's all worked up about,

05:46.040 --> 05:48.200
oh, it's going to be a big change because of the IBM

05:48.200 --> 05:49.880
influence and all of that.

05:49.880 --> 05:55.400
And so psychologically, we were all prepared for a shock,

05:55.400 --> 05:56.480
a totally new look.

05:56.480 --> 05:57.720
And then Red Hat comes out.

05:57.720 --> 05:59.000
They're like, nah, it's still a Red Hat.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.960
Yeah, it kind of feels just like a refinement,

06:00.960 --> 06:03.200
more of saying, yeah, let's continue our purpose.

06:03.200 --> 06:06.000
And it obviously does play and fit in a little bit better

06:06.000 --> 06:08.640
compared to all the competitors who play in their space

06:08.640 --> 06:09.680
have similar logos.

06:09.680 --> 06:12.120
I hope this reflects where Red Hat's going

06:12.120 --> 06:14.800
after this whole acquisition, a refinement of what we've

06:14.800 --> 06:15.720
known that is Red Hat.

06:15.720 --> 06:16.520
We'll see.

06:16.520 --> 06:19.880
You know, the thing about it is that this completely predates

06:19.880 --> 06:22.360
anybody's knowledge of IBM.

06:22.360 --> 06:26.240
I mean, Jim apparently only talked to IBM early last year.

06:26.240 --> 06:29.440
And we, of course, only found out late last year.

06:29.440 --> 06:31.440
And this open brand project's been in the works

06:31.440 --> 06:32.800
for a lot longer than that.

06:32.800 --> 06:33.680
So yep.

06:33.680 --> 06:34.320
I agree.

06:34.320 --> 06:34.840
I know.

06:34.840 --> 06:36.160
Good point to make, though.

06:36.160 --> 06:38.000
It should be said that I would really

06:38.000 --> 06:41.440
like to have one of the 1995 logos on a shirt.

06:41.440 --> 06:42.680
Yeah, that's funny.

06:42.680 --> 06:43.760
You want the retro look.

06:43.760 --> 06:46.320
Yeah, with the article we linked, and it's in the IRC.

06:46.320 --> 06:48.820
So if you're hanging out with us there, you can check it out.

06:48.820 --> 06:51.640
But it has their iterations from 95 to 99.

06:51.640 --> 06:55.480
Yeah, the last logo change was in 1999, 20 years.

06:55.480 --> 06:57.200
So I think it's about due, don't you?

06:57.200 --> 06:59.000
Absolutely.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.400
So is anything happening with the building topper?

07:01.400 --> 07:02.360
Oh, you got to wonder.

07:02.360 --> 07:03.240
They have to.

07:03.240 --> 07:05.040
I mean, you got to do a unified look, right?

07:05.040 --> 07:05.940
It's already changed.

07:05.940 --> 07:07.320
There was a whole thing downtown.

07:07.320 --> 07:10.280
You know, news stations, they had a banner.

07:10.280 --> 07:13.200
They had this whole brown banner covering it up with cloth.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.400
And they changed it about two weeks ago.

07:15.400 --> 07:19.240
And journalists picked it up about a week later.

07:19.240 --> 07:21.800
And the internal main list was going, well,

07:21.800 --> 07:24.040
it took them a while to notice.

07:24.040 --> 07:24.760
Well, you know.

07:24.760 --> 07:26.200
And then they had a big ceremony yesterday

07:26.200 --> 07:27.180
where they dropped a cloth off it,

07:27.180 --> 07:29.560
and Jim had a selfie in front of it and all the rest of it.

07:29.560 --> 07:32.200
But it lights up red at night.

07:32.200 --> 07:33.600
How nice is that?

07:33.600 --> 07:34.800
I like that, actually.

07:34.800 --> 07:36.360
So for those listening that don't know,

07:36.360 --> 07:39.300
Alex is a Red Hatter, so he has some.

07:39.300 --> 07:41.000
So he's tracking this, you might say.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.760
I live four miles from the tower, so it's pretty nice.

07:44.760 --> 07:47.680
You think at that distance, you could almost hook up wirelessly.

07:47.680 --> 07:49.320
I'll send the drone off.

07:49.320 --> 07:51.040
Yeah.

07:51.040 --> 07:51.960
Maybe not.

07:51.960 --> 07:53.720
Maybe don't do that.

07:53.720 --> 07:57.360
Well, I'm very, very happy to have Drew on board.

07:57.360 --> 08:01.000
What's great about Drew is pretty much all

08:01.000 --> 08:05.400
of the recent hires we've done have been from the community.

08:05.400 --> 08:08.680
In the most cases, they're from long, long-established community

08:08.680 --> 08:11.560
members, like Cheese has been a community member for 10 years.

08:11.560 --> 08:13.280
How long had you been listening before you came up

08:13.280 --> 08:14.520
for that barbecue many years ago?

08:14.520 --> 08:16.760
Not quite that long, but definitely a couple of years.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.120
Yeah, a couple of years.

08:18.120 --> 08:20.160
Drew is sort of on the other end of that.

08:20.160 --> 08:22.840
He's been a listener for about, what, five, six months, Drew?

08:22.840 --> 08:25.080
A little longer, maybe six, seven.

08:25.080 --> 08:26.560
But in that time frame, yeah.

08:26.560 --> 08:30.120
So right around the Linux Academy acquisition time frame,

08:30.120 --> 08:30.920
I would say, right?

08:30.920 --> 08:32.160
Is that when you kind of started listening?

08:32.160 --> 08:34.120
That's a good sign that he just started listening and then

08:34.120 --> 08:35.320
was willing to come and work with us.

08:35.320 --> 08:36.600
I know, I know.

08:36.600 --> 08:37.480
It's pretty great.

08:37.480 --> 08:40.880
And Drew has already gotten us hyped

08:40.880 --> 08:43.040
to the next level about Reaper and recording

08:43.040 --> 08:44.920
on Linux, which is perfect.

08:44.920 --> 08:47.400
Because Wes and I have already been getting pretty excited.

08:47.400 --> 08:49.840
We've been solving a lot of problems in the studio.

08:49.840 --> 08:51.200
And Reaper has really kind of just

08:51.200 --> 08:53.960
been proven to be a great choice for us.

08:53.960 --> 08:56.080
And so to have Drew join us right

08:56.080 --> 08:57.600
as we're kind of in that hype cycle

08:57.600 --> 08:59.600
already has really kind of taken everybody's excitement

08:59.600 --> 09:00.480
to the next level.

09:00.480 --> 09:03.440
We're sharing tricks and showing each other tips.

09:03.440 --> 09:05.240
And Drew's like blowing our minds with ways

09:05.240 --> 09:06.360
to make Reaper even better.

09:06.360 --> 09:07.480
All the time.

09:07.480 --> 09:08.520
That's pretty good.

09:08.520 --> 09:10.840
And I got a dark theme now for Reaper, so I'm pretty happy.

09:10.840 --> 09:13.760
It looks very professional in here.

09:13.760 --> 09:15.120
So Drew, it's great to have you.

09:15.120 --> 09:16.760
I'm glad you're able to join us for this episode.

09:16.760 --> 09:18.840
Because I know you're going to be traveling back home

09:18.840 --> 09:19.360
pretty soon.

09:19.360 --> 09:21.680
So the timing, it just kind of worked out.

09:21.680 --> 09:22.440
Yeah, me too.

09:22.440 --> 09:24.040
I'm really glad I was able to be here

09:24.040 --> 09:26.720
for a show in the studio as my first show.

09:26.720 --> 09:28.040
Oh, yeah, totally.

09:28.040 --> 09:28.960
That's perfect.

09:28.960 --> 09:33.000
And you're a long, long time desktop Linux user.

09:33.000 --> 09:33.600
Yes.

09:33.600 --> 09:34.200
How long?

09:34.200 --> 09:35.600
About 19, 20 years.

09:35.600 --> 09:36.200
Yeah.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.160
And Fedora is your primary jam.

09:38.160 --> 09:41.960
Although I believe right now on your laptop is Ubuntu 19.04.

09:41.960 --> 09:44.440
Yeah, you know, like most of us, I'll

09:44.440 --> 09:45.840
distro hop a little bit here and there

09:45.840 --> 09:47.080
when something new comes out.

09:47.080 --> 09:50.040
And you've got to have the shiny and see how it ticks.

09:50.040 --> 09:52.400
But I'll probably be back on Fedora 30

09:52.400 --> 09:53.400
by the end of the month.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.800
It was actually Drew talking about his love for Fedora.

09:55.800 --> 09:58.240
He was like, all right, I'm installing 30.

09:58.240 --> 09:59.480
Yeah, you were just sitting down.

09:59.480 --> 10:00.480
And I was impressed.

10:00.480 --> 10:01.480
You got it set up before very long.

10:01.480 --> 10:02.000
Dude.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.200
Yeah, we'll talk about that.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.360
I just, you know, I was like, OK,

10:04.360 --> 10:06.200
I had a good run with Manjaro on the ThinkPad.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.760
Now let's put 30 on there.

10:08.760 --> 10:10.560
And I messaged Joe.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.520
And I told Joe, I'm like, hey, Joe, I'm

10:12.520 --> 10:14.840
going to go ahead and give XFCE on Fedora a spin.

10:14.840 --> 10:16.960
And Joe's like, what'd you tell me, Joe?

10:16.960 --> 10:17.720
What'd you say?

10:17.720 --> 10:20.400
I said, I've never had great experiences with it

10:20.400 --> 10:21.680
because it's a bit too stock.

10:21.680 --> 10:24.480
It's a bit ugly and needs a bit of theming.

10:24.480 --> 10:27.040
But it sounds like you're willing to do that work to theme

10:27.040 --> 10:28.920
it and set it up exactly how you want it.

10:28.920 --> 10:32.920
Well, here's what I said is I said, I'll commit an evening.

10:32.920 --> 10:36.840
If I can get the config and the setup nailed in an evening,

10:36.840 --> 10:39.600
then I'll stick with it and I'll use it.

10:39.600 --> 10:41.080
And I attempted to do just that.

10:41.080 --> 10:42.680
So I'll tell you about how that went

10:42.680 --> 10:44.280
and what I ended up with here in just a little bit.

10:44.280 --> 10:46.480
Well, maybe we'll just do a little more community news

10:46.480 --> 10:47.480
before we get there.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.720
I think this is pretty exciting.

10:48.720 --> 10:52.040
Dell is launching a couple of new Linux-loaded machines,

10:52.040 --> 10:55.880
a Precision 3540 laptop that starts at $700 as well

10:55.880 --> 10:57.320
as some other systems.

10:57.320 --> 11:01.040
You still have that new Dell XPS 9380 developer edition.

11:01.040 --> 11:03.560
It's a beauty, has a lot of performance.

11:03.560 --> 11:05.120
But if the price is too much for you,

11:05.120 --> 11:08.240
Dell has launched their new budget mobile Precision laptop

11:08.240 --> 11:10.040
now with Linux options on there.

11:10.040 --> 11:12.920
Oh, yeah, the 3540.

11:12.920 --> 11:16.120
Now, it starts at just $702 American.

11:16.120 --> 11:20.560
I know, you get a Core i5, UHD Graphics 620,

11:20.560 --> 11:27.400
and unfortunately, a whopping 15-inch 1366 by 768 display.

11:27.400 --> 11:30.800
Also, that comes with 4 gigs of RAM and a 500-gig hard drive.

11:30.800 --> 11:36.480
Now, that doesn't sound great, but you can upgrade $700

11:36.480 --> 11:37.240
as a bottom.

11:37.240 --> 11:37.760
As a starting.

11:37.760 --> 11:38.680
It's not that bad.

11:38.680 --> 11:40.000
Yeah, that means when you've configured it

11:40.000 --> 11:41.620
the way you want it, you're not breaking the bank.

11:41.620 --> 11:42.400
So there's that.

11:42.400 --> 11:45.720
Also, I have some family members,

11:45.720 --> 11:48.680
like my dad, who cites it's OK, but it's

11:48.680 --> 11:51.840
starting to go a little bit for reading fine print on screens.

11:51.840 --> 11:53.720
So some of these resolutions for him.

11:53.720 --> 11:54.720
That might just be fun.

11:54.720 --> 11:55.560
Big text, it's good.

11:55.560 --> 11:56.960
He actually doesn't mind at all.

11:56.960 --> 11:59.960
The savings isn't huge over the Windows 10 edition.

11:59.960 --> 12:02.720
You save about $67 US greenbacks by going

12:02.720 --> 12:04.960
with Ubuntu over Windows 10.

12:04.960 --> 12:08.120
Now, if you're skeptical of the 3540 coming out later

12:08.120 --> 12:11.440
this month, there's going to be the 3541.

12:11.440 --> 12:13.880
That's going to have some nicer options, including a Xeon

12:13.880 --> 12:17.160
processor or Nvidia Quadro Graphics.

12:17.160 --> 12:19.480
Now, both of these ship with 1804,

12:19.480 --> 12:22.400
but they're also certified for RHEL 8.

12:22.400 --> 12:23.280
Isn't that interesting?

12:23.280 --> 12:24.760
Isn't that interesting?

12:24.760 --> 12:27.440
Well, tip of the hat there to Barton George and his team

12:27.440 --> 12:28.000
there at Dell.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.400
That's awesome to see another update coming out.

12:30.400 --> 12:33.400
Perhaps we'll hear more about that very soon from them.

12:33.400 --> 12:37.120
Kind of along those same lines, speaking of Ubuntu,

12:37.120 --> 12:40.840
Canonical has released WLCS.

12:40.840 --> 12:44.000
Any guesses what WLCS stands for?

12:44.000 --> 12:45.080
You have a guess?

12:45.080 --> 12:46.560
Well, I happen to already know.

12:46.560 --> 12:47.360
I know you know.

12:47.360 --> 12:48.440
That's not a fair question.

12:48.440 --> 12:48.760
All right.

12:48.760 --> 12:49.240
All right.

12:49.240 --> 12:53.400
It is the Wayland Conformance Suite.

12:53.400 --> 12:55.120
Now, Ubuntu, as you know, is not currently

12:55.120 --> 12:57.380
using Wayland by default. And it doesn't

12:57.380 --> 12:59.760
look like they're even going to give that a shot again

12:59.760 --> 13:01.600
until Ubuntu 2010.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.880
The option is, of course, still available if you want to give

13:03.880 --> 13:05.000
it a go-skis.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.720
And they're working to set up a compliance suite.

13:09.720 --> 13:12.560
I guess that's like a suite of testing to validate?

13:12.560 --> 13:13.040
Yeah.

13:13.040 --> 13:14.920
Well, I mean, what do we always say about Wayland?

13:14.920 --> 13:16.600
It's the protocol, not the implementation.

13:16.600 --> 13:17.480
It's not a display server.

13:17.480 --> 13:17.880
It's a protocol.

13:17.880 --> 13:17.880
Yeah.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.720
And so it makes sense to be able to test

13:19.720 --> 13:22.160
that things implement that protocol in a standard way.

13:22.160 --> 13:23.720
So you can have multiple implementations,

13:23.720 --> 13:25.600
test them against each other, and test them

13:25.600 --> 13:28.080
against a standard battery of tests.

13:28.080 --> 13:29.000
That does make sense.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.480
So as part of their Wayland interests

13:30.480 --> 13:33.680
and as part of developing the mirror, now with Wayland

13:33.680 --> 13:37.080
support, they've been working on this Wayland Conformance

13:37.080 --> 13:40.120
Suite for testing the Wayland protocols for the conformance

13:40.120 --> 13:43.160
to the written specifications for Wayland.

13:43.160 --> 13:45.320
Now, basically, as I said, it's just

13:45.320 --> 13:47.520
ensuring Wayland compositors behave correctly

13:47.520 --> 13:49.720
against all of the documented specifications

13:49.720 --> 13:51.640
for the protocols.

13:51.640 --> 13:54.080
Now, just this morning, canonical developer Chris

13:54.080 --> 13:57.040
Rogers released the Wayland Conformance Suite 1.0,

13:57.040 --> 13:58.760
and that's why we're talking about it today.

13:58.760 --> 14:01.600
In its current state, there are about 300 tests

14:01.600 --> 14:04.760
to vet Wayland surface events, the Wayland shell protocol,

14:04.760 --> 14:07.480
XDG shell, and a few other things.

14:07.480 --> 14:08.720
Yeah, OK.

14:08.720 --> 14:09.440
I like that.

14:09.440 --> 14:10.360
That's a great idea.

14:10.360 --> 14:10.880
It is, right?

14:10.880 --> 14:13.400
And it's a good example of different interests

14:13.400 --> 14:15.800
working together on some common software that

14:15.800 --> 14:17.560
helps everyone using Wayland.

14:17.560 --> 14:19.320
I happen to also know the developer that's

14:19.320 --> 14:21.000
responsible for some of this.

14:21.000 --> 14:25.320
Chris is a genius, a genius.

14:25.320 --> 14:28.340
This is a brilliant mind that is doing incredible development,

14:28.340 --> 14:29.920
and it's great that Canonical is now

14:29.920 --> 14:32.400
paying him to contribute that towards Wayland

14:32.400 --> 14:35.240
and making it possible to adopt Wayland.

14:35.240 --> 14:35.760
Yeah, right.

14:35.760 --> 14:38.120
This is going to benefit the entire community.

14:38.120 --> 14:39.080
All right.

14:39.080 --> 14:41.560
Now we have something we want to ask the audience.

14:41.560 --> 14:43.480
I bought a Nintendo Switch a while ago

14:43.480 --> 14:45.720
with the intention of putting Linux on it,

14:45.720 --> 14:47.440
but then there's a problem, Wes.

14:47.440 --> 14:50.200
I turned out to love the Switch.

14:50.200 --> 14:53.080
I mean, it is an excellent game playing device,

14:53.080 --> 14:54.440
so I can see how that might happen.

14:54.440 --> 14:55.320
Have you had a chance to try one?

14:55.320 --> 14:55.480
Yeah.

14:55.480 --> 14:58.440
I don't own one, although I have been tempted to purchase one,

14:58.440 --> 15:00.760
but I've played it at friends, and it's great.

15:00.760 --> 15:02.480
Drew, have you had a chance to try one?

15:02.480 --> 15:05.440
I actually haven't ever really played one.

15:05.440 --> 15:06.280
You're going to have to let them.

15:06.280 --> 15:07.120
I mean, do you have it here with you?

15:07.120 --> 15:07.640
Yeah, I did.

15:07.640 --> 15:08.800
Yeah, I always.

15:08.800 --> 15:11.360
I was very skeptical, because it seemed just

15:11.360 --> 15:12.280
like a rip-off tablet.

15:12.280 --> 15:14.280
They were sticking some controllers via Bluetooth

15:14.280 --> 15:18.080
on and having, essentially, a Nintendo label badged on it.

15:18.080 --> 15:19.080
I was wrong about that.

15:19.080 --> 15:21.200
It's a great gaming device, and so I haven't really

15:21.200 --> 15:23.320
taken the plunge to try to put Linux on it yet.

15:23.320 --> 15:24.440
Right, and you've just been satisfied

15:24.440 --> 15:25.320
in its current role.

15:25.320 --> 15:29.880
However, things may be changing, Wes.

15:29.880 --> 15:32.200
I got to get a push from the audience.

15:32.200 --> 15:36.160
I don't want to break my Switch without at least knowing

15:36.160 --> 15:38.880
that the audience wants to know how this works.

15:38.880 --> 15:41.240
So if you would like me to Linux my Switch,

15:41.240 --> 15:42.840
I want you to tweet me at ChrisLAS

15:42.840 --> 15:44.680
or ping me in the Telegram channel,

15:44.680 --> 15:50.520
hashtag Linux the Switch, hashtag Linux the Switch.

15:50.520 --> 15:52.640
Let me know if you want us to attempt

15:52.640 --> 15:54.800
to put Linux on my Nintendo Switch,

15:54.800 --> 15:57.520
because Wes and I are going to need to 3D print

15:57.520 --> 15:59.120
a component to do this.

15:59.120 --> 16:01.720
It's a little involved, could break the Switch.

16:01.720 --> 16:03.920
Who knows, or get you banned.

16:03.920 --> 16:09.600
But we would be using L4T Ubuntu, a friendly Linux

16:09.600 --> 16:11.200
distro for your Switch.

16:11.200 --> 16:12.920
It sounds like it's, I mean, as they call it,

16:12.920 --> 16:15.320
quote unquote, fully featured.

16:15.320 --> 16:19.120
Dock support, Bluetooth, NVIDIA drivers for the GPU, audio,

16:19.120 --> 16:20.000
the Joy-Cons work.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.560
Not if you connect them directly,

16:21.560 --> 16:24.520
but they work when they're remotely connected.

16:24.520 --> 16:27.240
I don't know why that's the case, but it just is.

16:27.240 --> 16:29.800
Wi-Fi display, touch screen, CPU frequency scaling,

16:29.800 --> 16:32.200
so it sounds like the battery life might actually be OK.

16:32.200 --> 16:33.600
Yeah.

16:33.600 --> 16:36.120
And even video accelerated playback.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.800
That's not bad.

16:37.800 --> 16:39.400
It might actually be a useful device.

16:39.400 --> 16:39.800
I don't know.

16:39.800 --> 16:40.800
We haven't tried it yet.

16:40.800 --> 16:43.080
You know what the killer use case for that would be?

16:43.080 --> 16:47.360
Is running, if they have any built for that processor,

16:47.360 --> 16:50.160
would be running emulators to play the Super Nintendo

16:50.160 --> 16:53.160
on my Switch.

16:53.160 --> 16:54.120
All right, let me know.

16:54.120 --> 16:57.440
Hashtag Linux the Switch if you want us to try this.

16:57.440 --> 16:59.560
I'll 3D print the thing for you if you want.

16:59.560 --> 17:00.080
Awesome.

17:00.080 --> 17:00.800
There we go.

17:00.800 --> 17:01.840
Now we've got the hookup.

17:01.840 --> 17:03.800
And I think the first thing you should test is,

17:03.800 --> 17:06.040
will it run Doom?

17:06.040 --> 17:06.920
Yes, of course.

17:06.920 --> 17:07.600
Crisis, dude.

17:07.600 --> 17:09.080
It's got to run crisis.

17:09.080 --> 17:09.800
There you go.

17:09.800 --> 17:12.240
Chris, I think you need a burner switch is what you need.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.720
You need a good switch and a burner switch.

17:13.720 --> 17:14.320
You're right.

17:14.320 --> 17:15.200
The best of both worlds.

17:15.200 --> 17:15.600
You're right.

17:15.600 --> 17:16.960
I need another switch, of course.

17:16.960 --> 17:17.960
For show purposes.

17:17.960 --> 17:19.160
For show purposes.

17:19.160 --> 17:21.600
So what I should do then is strategically wait,

17:21.600 --> 17:22.920
because the rumor is there's going

17:22.920 --> 17:26.080
to be different sized switches, like a Switch XL coming out.

17:26.080 --> 17:27.640
So I get the Switch XL for myself,

17:27.640 --> 17:29.760
and then I dedicate the current Switch

17:29.760 --> 17:31.800
that is hackable to the show.

17:31.800 --> 17:35.520
I mean, it's the right thing to do.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.800
All right, a little housekeeping before we keep going.

17:37.800 --> 17:39.200
Not much this week.

17:39.200 --> 17:41.080
However, we promised it, and we are

17:41.080 --> 17:42.480
beginning to deliver right now.

17:42.480 --> 17:45.320
We have started to post the audio for the LinuxFest

17:45.320 --> 17:46.640
Northwest talks.

17:46.640 --> 17:47.840
You're working on it right now.

17:47.840 --> 17:48.560
I take it.

17:48.560 --> 17:49.680
Yes, absolutely.

17:49.680 --> 17:51.880
There might be something preventing us from doing that,

17:51.880 --> 17:53.440
but it'll be up in just a moment.

17:53.440 --> 17:56.640
Well, the issue is we're trying to upload like 90 megabyte flack

17:56.640 --> 17:59.240
files to GitHub, which is not designed

17:59.240 --> 18:00.760
to hold 90 meg flack files.

18:00.760 --> 18:02.120
But it's happening anyway.

18:02.120 --> 18:03.160
We're going to get it to work, you think?

18:03.160 --> 18:03.800
Oh, yeah, of course.

18:03.800 --> 18:05.640
All right, I'll put a link in the show notes.

18:05.640 --> 18:08.520
It's github.com slash jupyterbroadcasting slash talks.

18:08.520 --> 18:09.920
We have the audio up right now.

18:09.920 --> 18:12.960
As folks that were involved submit their talks to us,

18:12.960 --> 18:14.800
either the slides for like a link to it,

18:14.800 --> 18:17.360
or the PDF of it, or something like that,

18:17.360 --> 18:20.000
we will add those to the GitHub as well.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.700
So you can download the audio, and then

18:21.700 --> 18:23.620
follow along at your own pace with the slides.

18:23.620 --> 18:26.120
Yeah, ideally one place to find all those things.

18:26.120 --> 18:28.800
Yeah, and I plan to do this with future talks, too.

18:28.800 --> 18:32.480
So keep that jupyterbroadcasting slash talks directory

18:32.480 --> 18:34.960
bookmarked, because we'll probably

18:34.960 --> 18:36.400
have more in the future, I think.

18:36.400 --> 18:38.400
Right now, we'll start with Linux Fest Northwest.

18:38.400 --> 18:41.280
So that's github.com slash jupyterbroadcasting slash talks

18:41.280 --> 18:42.760
to find those.

18:42.760 --> 18:45.120
To get the audio and the slides, you can find it all up

18:45.120 --> 18:47.740
in that business.

18:47.740 --> 18:50.760
Now, only one other thing to talk about in the housekeeping,

18:50.760 --> 18:54.520
probably the most important thing, the Friday stream.

18:54.520 --> 18:55.080
Join us.

18:55.080 --> 18:56.840
We'll be back from Red Hat Summit,

18:56.840 --> 19:00.760
and we'll be doing a special back from Boston Friday

19:00.760 --> 19:01.280
stream.

19:01.280 --> 19:02.400
It's going to be a big one.

19:02.400 --> 19:05.840
And up on YouTube right now is the Linux Fest Northwest

19:05.840 --> 19:08.240
pre-party Friday, the family reunion edition.

19:08.240 --> 19:09.160
That's what I call it.

19:09.160 --> 19:10.120
It's a family reunion.

19:10.120 --> 19:10.840
That's adorable.

19:10.840 --> 19:11.540
It really was.

19:11.540 --> 19:13.600
And that's up on YouTube right now,

19:13.600 --> 19:16.080
youtube.com slash jupyterbroadcasting.

19:16.080 --> 19:19.640
And the rumor has it there may soon be a dedicated Friday

19:19.640 --> 19:21.200
stream feed.

19:21.200 --> 19:23.200
What day is that on, though?

19:23.200 --> 19:23.720
I'm not sure.

19:23.720 --> 19:25.600
I think it might be on Fridays.

19:25.600 --> 19:26.680
Might be on Friday.

19:26.680 --> 19:27.480
Such a troll.

19:30.440 --> 19:31.380
It's on Friday.

19:31.380 --> 19:32.240
It's Friday.

19:32.240 --> 19:32.920
It's on Friday.

19:32.920 --> 19:34.680
Yeah, so the thing about the Friday stream

19:34.680 --> 19:36.720
is we have a great crew here now.

19:36.720 --> 19:38.600
And I just wanted to give the audience a chance

19:38.600 --> 19:43.280
to meet the crew, just share stories, kind of just

19:43.280 --> 19:45.920
build relationships with the audience and the crew.

19:45.920 --> 19:47.640
And that's what the Friday stream is about.

19:47.640 --> 19:48.920
So I'm a little more casual, and we

19:48.920 --> 19:51.480
can dive into the diverse number of topics that don't always

19:51.480 --> 19:52.720
make it to the other shows.

19:52.720 --> 19:54.260
Yeah, we often will have in-jokes

19:54.260 --> 19:57.080
that we reference or things of that nature.

19:57.080 --> 19:59.880
And you'll hear the history, and you'll

19:59.880 --> 20:02.400
learn about those in the Friday stream,

20:02.400 --> 20:05.520
as well as, at least for now, a recap of some of the shows.

20:05.520 --> 20:07.100
And we'll play some clips of the shows

20:07.100 --> 20:09.600
and expand on them and follow up a little bit.

20:09.600 --> 20:10.720
It's just a ton of fun.

20:10.720 --> 20:13.280
So check that out, jblive.tv on Fridays,

20:13.280 --> 20:15.000
jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar

20:15.000 --> 20:18.960
to get it in your local time zone, as always, as always.

20:18.960 --> 20:20.040
And there you have it.

20:20.040 --> 20:20.720
That's it right there.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.560
That is the extent of the housekeeping, nice and short.

20:23.560 --> 20:24.400
Get it out of here.

20:24.400 --> 20:25.520
Get it out of here.

20:25.520 --> 20:28.280
All right, Fedora 30 has been released.

20:28.280 --> 20:32.040
We've had a bit of fun with it over the last few days.

20:32.040 --> 20:34.680
And I walked away with a pretty great setup.

20:34.680 --> 20:36.000
So I thought, let's sit down here

20:36.000 --> 20:37.620
and talk about it a little bit.

20:37.620 --> 20:41.400
Now, you have, Wes, a very unique configuration.

20:41.400 --> 20:44.920
Perhaps you could describe this as the high performance

20:44.920 --> 20:45.840
Fedora 30 setup.

20:45.840 --> 20:46.540
Yeah, that's right.

20:46.540 --> 20:47.740
I mean, I'm once again running it

20:47.740 --> 20:49.280
out of that persistent memory device,

20:49.280 --> 20:51.880
because it's just so easy and at hand.

20:51.880 --> 20:53.840
You say it casually, like everybody just

20:53.840 --> 20:55.440
knows what you're talking about.

20:55.440 --> 20:57.480
It actually does take a lot of fiddling, too.

20:57.480 --> 20:59.440
So for those of you that have missed the Friday

20:59.440 --> 21:01.640
stream or Coder Radio, one of the ways

21:01.640 --> 21:03.800
that Wes likes to try out software,

21:03.800 --> 21:05.160
you know, if it's just a quick go,

21:05.160 --> 21:10.080
is to build an entire environment in persistent RAM,

21:10.080 --> 21:12.280
which is a funny term to begin with, persistent RAM.

21:12.280 --> 21:13.680
Yeah, and it's not real persistent RAM.

21:13.680 --> 21:14.880
Not a few, not a sheet power off.

21:14.880 --> 21:15.880
It's just emulated, yeah.

21:15.880 --> 21:19.000
But as long as you keep your laptop on, as I generally do,

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
it works just fine.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.440
So I can boot into it, or right now, as we're doing the show,

21:23.440 --> 21:25.200
I just have it running in a virtual machine,

21:25.200 --> 21:26.400
but out of the same device.

21:26.400 --> 21:27.400
Oh.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.640
So actually, I just set it up using the virtual machine,

21:29.640 --> 21:29.880
right?

21:29.880 --> 21:32.600
Go click through it there while I keep my original OS running.

21:32.600 --> 21:34.760
And then once it's all set up, reboot it.

21:34.760 --> 21:37.200
And then you Kexec into the environment that runs in RAM?

21:37.200 --> 21:37.480
Yeah.

21:37.480 --> 21:39.560
And as long as you don't reboot, you can also add it.

21:39.560 --> 21:40.440
Or you can reboot.

21:40.440 --> 21:43.480
You just can't shut down for a period of time, really.

21:43.480 --> 21:45.760
Kexec is faster and works well, too.

21:45.760 --> 21:46.400
So I do that.

21:46.400 --> 21:49.160
But you can actually just add it to your grub entry.

21:49.160 --> 21:49.920
Reboot.

21:49.920 --> 21:52.440
As long as your machine's not kind of slow,

21:52.440 --> 21:53.720
this might vary per machine.

21:53.720 --> 21:56.560
But on everything I've tried it with, it works pretty reliably.

21:56.560 --> 21:58.000
You can just add it to the grub menu

21:58.000 --> 21:59.800
and then have another OS installed that's

21:59.800 --> 22:01.440
actually just stuck in RAM.

22:01.440 --> 22:04.280
So does it load a base OS, initialize the RAM,

22:04.280 --> 22:07.040
load the OS in the memory, and then boot it?

22:07.040 --> 22:09.200
Well, it basically is just another device, right?

22:09.200 --> 22:11.760
So you need to make sure you add an additional module

22:11.760 --> 22:13.380
unless your kernel actually includes it.

22:13.380 --> 22:14.960
Most of the time, it's a separate module

22:14.960 --> 22:15.920
that you have to load.

22:15.920 --> 22:18.400
So it's the same kernel as the host op, the main OS installed?

22:18.400 --> 22:20.160
Yeah, well, I'm using the Fedora kernel.

22:20.160 --> 22:20.880
Ah, OK.

22:20.880 --> 22:24.480
Yeah, it's just like a new device existing on my system.

22:24.480 --> 22:28.200
It just happens to actually be a reserved block of memory.

22:28.200 --> 22:29.440
So there is some trickiness.

22:29.440 --> 22:31.240
You have to go customize things and make sure,

22:31.240 --> 22:33.280
depending on how your init RAMFS is built,

22:33.280 --> 22:36.440
different systems, like Drawcut for Fedora, for instance,

22:36.440 --> 22:38.440
go add the additional modules you might need

22:38.440 --> 22:41.440
or build a custom kernel if that's your preferred route.

22:41.440 --> 22:43.400
Then you can add that, either use Kexec

22:43.400 --> 22:44.960
or add it to your grub menu.

22:44.960 --> 22:45.580
Away you go.

22:45.580 --> 22:47.800
So when you're installing and you're

22:47.800 --> 22:50.960
going through the Anaconda installer,

22:50.960 --> 22:52.800
what does the disk partitioner see?

22:52.800 --> 22:54.340
Since I did it in a virtual machine,

22:54.340 --> 22:55.560
it just saw a normal disk.

22:55.560 --> 22:56.720
Ah, OK.

22:56.720 --> 22:58.880
Yeah, so it set up LVM like normal.

22:58.880 --> 23:03.080
I just did the plain default Fedora install.

23:03.080 --> 23:04.840
That's so cool.

23:04.840 --> 23:07.720
And then you turn around and load that into RAM.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.120
And then it was already, yeah.

23:09.120 --> 23:10.920
You set up the RAM disk, you boot up,

23:10.920 --> 23:12.680
you have to add a kernel command line parameter that

23:12.680 --> 23:14.440
reserves the RAM and makes it appear

23:14.440 --> 23:15.600
as a device to the system.

23:15.600 --> 23:16.480
Right, OK.

23:16.480 --> 23:18.560
Yeah, and then I just pointed VirtualBox at it

23:18.560 --> 23:21.040
and set it up like normal.

23:21.040 --> 23:23.320
I love how nonchalantly you describe that,

23:23.320 --> 23:25.780
as if it's just something that you casually did.

23:25.780 --> 23:27.200
And I'm sitting here like an animal

23:27.200 --> 23:29.620
running it on physical hardware, like some sort of jerk.

23:29.620 --> 23:32.220
So as a result of that, I had to get a little nitty-gritty

23:32.220 --> 23:34.480
with some of the grub configuration for Fedora.

23:34.480 --> 23:35.560
I was poking around there.

23:35.560 --> 23:38.280
And I noticed one of the changes that they made,

23:38.280 --> 23:41.240
which is this new grub plugin, it

23:41.240 --> 23:44.200
follows the bootloader spec style of configuration.

23:44.200 --> 23:46.000
So now there's a separate, maybe if you've

23:46.000 --> 23:48.160
used systemd boot sort of stuff, you're

23:48.160 --> 23:50.160
familiar with this style.

23:50.160 --> 23:52.760
Instead of under the grub config folder,

23:52.760 --> 23:54.520
it's under the loaders folder.

23:54.520 --> 23:55.600
And it's a simpler setup.

23:55.600 --> 23:58.120
It's just sort of like each line is setting something,

23:58.120 --> 24:00.280
like here's the kernel you're using,

24:00.280 --> 24:02.160
here's the initRAMFS you're using,

24:02.160 --> 24:04.600
any arguments that actually just inherit whatever default

24:04.600 --> 24:06.180
arguments are being passed down.

24:06.180 --> 24:08.640
And that way, instead of having to customize the grub2

24:08.640 --> 24:11.200
configuration, which if any of you out there know

24:11.200 --> 24:15.160
is full featured but a bit complicated to use,

24:15.160 --> 24:17.280
you can easily define multiple entries.

24:17.280 --> 24:19.840
And I think it's going to be a little more resilient

24:19.840 --> 24:21.520
because it does it at boot time.

24:21.520 --> 24:24.000
So you're not relying on this fully bootable host

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
OS to be able to regenerate all the grub.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.840
We've all had to chroot in, go update grub.

24:28.840 --> 24:31.480
Yeah, if it's just down to some configuration parameters

24:31.480 --> 24:33.800
or something, it just lives on the thing.

24:33.800 --> 24:35.760
And when grub starts, it loads this module,

24:35.760 --> 24:39.240
which reads these entries and generates grub entries.

24:39.240 --> 24:40.280
That's fancy.

24:40.280 --> 24:41.560
I like that.

24:41.560 --> 24:42.680
Nice deep dive there.

24:42.680 --> 24:43.960
Thank you.

24:43.960 --> 24:45.680
The other thing that I think both you and I were really

24:45.680 --> 24:47.080
looking forward to in this release

24:47.080 --> 24:49.360
is the flicker-free boot.

24:49.360 --> 24:50.680
What do you think of that so far?

24:50.680 --> 24:53.640
So far, it's pretty shiny, at least in my experiment.

24:53.640 --> 24:56.040
Yeah, mine has not had flicker-free boot.

24:56.040 --> 24:58.960
And I think in part it's because I'm using XFCE

24:58.960 --> 25:00.080
and I'm not using Wayland.

25:00.080 --> 25:03.840
And you're probably using Wayland, Gnome Shell.

25:03.840 --> 25:04.880
It is really nice.

25:04.880 --> 25:05.960
It is nice.

25:05.960 --> 25:09.760
But I also would be 100% happy just always looking

25:09.760 --> 25:11.320
at the text output of the boot.

25:11.320 --> 25:14.400
Since day one, since the very, very, very, very first moment

25:14.400 --> 25:17.160
I ever tried Linux, one of the first impressions I had

25:17.160 --> 25:19.120
was that boot text flying across the screen

25:19.120 --> 25:21.680
telling me what my computer was actually doing.

25:21.680 --> 25:24.040
And from that very first moment, I've loved it.

25:24.040 --> 25:26.320
And I often will just clear the boot screen.

25:26.320 --> 25:28.360
Yeah, usually, actually, I just said we're both.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.480
So anyway, even if it has a nice boot screen.

25:30.480 --> 25:34.720
Generally, I just leave it until the next time I

25:34.720 --> 25:36.160
have a reason to go into grub.

25:36.160 --> 25:38.440
And then when I'm in there editing the menu entry,

25:38.440 --> 25:41.040
I'll just take it out and I'm like, ah, let's do this now.

25:41.040 --> 25:41.880
While I'm in here.

25:41.880 --> 25:44.440
But Flickr Free Boot is one of the new features

25:44.440 --> 25:45.920
that people are talking a lot about.

25:45.920 --> 25:48.520
Bash 5.0 also shipping in this SOB.

25:48.520 --> 25:52.520
Big update to Python in this, as well as GCC 9.

25:52.520 --> 25:58.120
And of course, last but absolutely not least, Gnome 3.32.

25:58.120 --> 25:59.040
Of course.

25:59.040 --> 26:02.960
I think it's not an exaggeration to say the absolute best

26:02.960 --> 26:05.400
release of Gnome Shell that's ever been released.

26:05.400 --> 26:06.900
I really can't argue with that, right?

26:06.900 --> 26:10.660
I mean, it just feels like a good, solid gnome.

26:10.660 --> 26:11.680
It's fast.

26:11.680 --> 26:13.520
It's been polished up a little bit.

26:13.520 --> 26:17.240
It feels like Gnome 3 has what it was meant to be.

26:17.240 --> 26:18.760
Yeah, and I'll say this.

26:18.760 --> 26:21.920
It's made things awkward for guys like me

26:21.920 --> 26:24.820
that want to kind of keep one toe in the Gnome Shell world

26:24.820 --> 26:25.520
now.

26:25.520 --> 26:27.520
It really means I'm in a position

26:27.520 --> 26:30.160
where I have to run a cutting edge distro.

26:30.160 --> 26:33.840
I'm either on Fedora 30 or Ubuntu 19.04 right now.

26:33.840 --> 26:35.240
Old Gnome won't cut it anymore.

26:35.240 --> 26:35.740
Right.

26:35.740 --> 26:38.080
Well, if I want the latest and greatest Gnome memory

26:38.080 --> 26:40.560
improvements, if I want the latest performance fixes

26:40.560 --> 26:44.120
and the latest stability additions and improvements,

26:44.120 --> 26:46.520
I've got to be running on a later distribution.

26:46.520 --> 26:49.320
No more LTS for me if I want Gnome Shell.

26:49.320 --> 26:51.000
That's an interesting position to be in.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.400
And I would argue that if you're a big Gnome Shell user,

26:53.400 --> 26:56.120
the new additions and improvements to Gnome,

26:56.120 --> 27:00.880
or Gnome 3.32, are kind of worth upgrading.

27:00.880 --> 27:02.320
Thankfully, this will just be solved.

27:02.320 --> 27:04.680
Wait a little while, and next releases

27:04.680 --> 27:05.920
will have the good stuff.

27:05.920 --> 27:10.840
So I said, no, I will not be subject to this rat race.

27:10.840 --> 27:12.760
I will not be subject to this.

27:12.760 --> 27:14.120
And I had an epiphany.

27:14.120 --> 27:17.000
Talking to Drew, it hit me.

27:17.000 --> 27:21.200
I could have the perfect stack, a ThinkPad hardware,

27:21.200 --> 27:25.680
a clean, simple Fedora 30 installation base,

27:25.680 --> 27:29.880
and the XFCE desktop on top of it.

27:29.880 --> 27:32.080
Think about that just from a high level standpoint,

27:32.080 --> 27:35.960
how clean, simple, and efficient that sounds.

27:35.960 --> 27:37.080
It's appealing.

27:37.080 --> 27:40.720
Drew, what is it about Fedora that's

27:40.720 --> 27:42.840
drewing you in over the years?

27:42.840 --> 27:43.920
You see what I did there.

27:43.920 --> 27:48.560
What I like about Fedora is that I really understand

27:48.560 --> 27:53.280
and like how simplified the base OS is.

27:53.280 --> 27:57.160
I never get confused going through trying to figure out

27:57.160 --> 27:59.600
where stuff is because, for example, they've already

27:59.600 --> 28:03.120
solved the slash user slash bin issues,

28:03.120 --> 28:07.480
and they've really kind of tidied up the OS in a way

28:07.480 --> 28:10.880
that really I love.

28:10.880 --> 28:16.240
On top of that, it's modern, and working with flat packs

28:16.240 --> 28:20.040
makes it a really nice distribution to use.

28:20.040 --> 28:22.760
Now, you can run into some issues

28:22.760 --> 28:24.760
if you're trying to run snaps since you

28:24.760 --> 28:28.040
have to go SE Linux permissive if you want to run snaps,

28:28.040 --> 28:32.480
which I don't do SE Linux permissive.

28:32.480 --> 28:34.640
I came from the MSP world.

28:34.640 --> 28:38.240
Security was one of the things that I did, and yeah.

28:38.240 --> 28:39.440
So no snaps for me.

28:39.440 --> 28:41.760
And that is another thing we don't often talk about Fedora,

28:41.760 --> 28:44.760
but I mean, SE Linux is just right there for you

28:44.760 --> 28:47.800
if you do have that background or you do have those concerns.

28:47.800 --> 28:49.600
Right, and I prefer that to App Armor.

28:49.600 --> 28:52.800
I also tend to prefer Firewall D to UFW.

28:52.800 --> 28:57.120
I find both App Armor and UFW, I just

28:57.120 --> 29:00.240
don't, it might just be that I haven't spent enough time

29:00.240 --> 29:03.480
with them, but they feel clunky to me.

29:03.480 --> 29:08.600
And I know that part of that is from my background of coming

29:08.600 --> 29:12.400
from things like doing network engineering,

29:12.400 --> 29:14.720
Firewall D makes a little more sense.

29:14.720 --> 29:16.240
It's better for people like me who

29:16.240 --> 29:20.080
come from that world without a major transition into the way

29:20.080 --> 29:24.880
UFW does it and tries to simplify things and automate

29:24.880 --> 29:28.200
a lot of the processes through apt and apt scripts

29:28.200 --> 29:30.040
when you go to install something,

29:30.040 --> 29:32.120
automatically opening up your Firewall port.

29:32.120 --> 29:34.400
Right, whereas you already know how to do those things.

29:34.400 --> 29:36.560
You're comfortable managing that yourself,

29:36.560 --> 29:38.280
and Firewall D lets you do that.

29:38.280 --> 29:40.120
And now that said, I'm not installing Fedora

29:40.120 --> 29:41.160
on my wife's laptop.

29:41.160 --> 29:44.440
She's getting Ubuntu because it's

29:44.440 --> 29:46.600
easier for somebody who's a little less technically

29:46.600 --> 29:49.200
inclined to really wrap their brain around.

29:49.200 --> 29:51.800
I'm a little curious, as a longtime Fedora user,

29:51.800 --> 29:55.240
how you feel about just the update and support cycle,

29:55.240 --> 29:57.240
especially if you're using it on maybe something

29:57.240 --> 29:58.760
more like a workstation.

29:58.760 --> 30:00.320
Sure.

30:00.320 --> 30:03.600
Well, I always tend to kind of stay up to date.

30:03.600 --> 30:06.080
But then again, that's because I typically know how to fix

30:06.080 --> 30:07.320
things when they break.

30:07.320 --> 30:08.880
I also feel a little more confident.

30:08.880 --> 30:10.280
You and I were talking about this,

30:10.280 --> 30:14.000
using DNF to do those upgrades, because it's

30:14.000 --> 30:16.200
a very implicit process that you go through,

30:16.200 --> 30:18.160
and then it does essentially a preflight check

30:18.160 --> 30:19.360
before it does the upgrade.

30:19.360 --> 30:20.120
I love that.

30:20.120 --> 30:22.720
DNF just feels robust and well-designed.

30:22.720 --> 30:23.400
Yeah.

30:23.400 --> 30:25.600
And that one, you could see how Drew sucked me back

30:25.600 --> 30:26.240
into using Fedora.

30:26.240 --> 30:28.240
Absolutely.

30:28.240 --> 30:30.080
And then I'm like, OK, well, let's try

30:30.080 --> 30:31.320
this ultimate stack.

30:31.320 --> 30:35.120
So I got my ThinkPad going with Fedora 30 on there.

30:35.120 --> 30:36.520
Here's what I found interesting is

30:36.520 --> 30:39.800
Joe's concern was that it would be quite a bit of work

30:39.800 --> 30:40.480
to get it set up.

30:40.480 --> 30:42.680
And Joe, you were kind of half right.

30:42.680 --> 30:44.800
Here's what I was surprised by.

30:44.800 --> 30:47.320
A couple of things were pre-installed

30:47.320 --> 30:49.840
that make it a lot simpler to use XFCE.

30:49.840 --> 30:53.000
Number one, the whisker menu, a current version

30:53.000 --> 30:54.560
of the whisker menu, is installed.

30:54.560 --> 30:56.320
It's just not in the menu by default.

30:56.320 --> 30:58.240
So you have to go hunting for it if you want it.

30:58.240 --> 31:00.720
You can kill the existing menu, right click on the panel,

31:00.720 --> 31:03.620
add item, add whisker menu, good to go.

31:03.620 --> 31:05.040
That's all it takes.

31:05.040 --> 31:09.400
Also, happy to report, the arc and arc dark themes

31:09.400 --> 31:10.780
are pre-installed.

31:10.780 --> 31:16.520
It's using Edwadia by default, and it looks a little rough,

31:16.520 --> 31:18.340
especially with that new background.

31:18.340 --> 31:21.200
The colors, it's just all, it's a little 1990s.

31:21.200 --> 31:24.880
It's like the most stereotypical XFCE first impression.

31:24.880 --> 31:26.420
I don't hate it, but that just might

31:26.420 --> 31:28.880
be because I used to use it looking exactly like that.

31:28.880 --> 31:30.580
So I have a nostalgic love.

31:30.580 --> 31:34.080
So I went and flipped that thing over to arc dark

31:34.080 --> 31:38.960
in about 3.7 seconds, and then went and downloaded the pop OS

31:38.960 --> 31:43.640
icons, installed them, good to go.

31:43.640 --> 31:46.560
Pretty much everything I wanted, Slack, Telegram,

31:46.560 --> 31:49.440
was all available as a flat pack.

31:49.440 --> 31:50.040
I quickly.

31:50.040 --> 31:52.240
You mean all that proprietary software?

31:52.240 --> 31:52.760
Yeah.

31:52.760 --> 31:55.680
And the other thing I was happy to report, it's not flawless,

31:55.680 --> 31:59.480
but it was just a quick DNF install gnome-software.

31:59.480 --> 32:01.880
And I had the whole gnome software downloaded

32:01.880 --> 32:03.960
and installed, which made it really easy

32:03.960 --> 32:07.700
to add the Chrome repository and a bunch of other things

32:07.700 --> 32:13.220
like proprietary drivers, codecs like the Cisco H.264 codec,

32:13.220 --> 32:15.640
as well as download and install updates

32:15.640 --> 32:17.400
and search for applications.

32:17.400 --> 32:20.600
I wouldn't say the integration with gnome software and XFCE

32:20.600 --> 32:23.160
is all that good, but it's functional.

32:23.160 --> 32:24.160
See, this is impressive.

32:24.160 --> 32:25.840
I'm just thinking back to the last days.

32:25.840 --> 32:27.560
And what do you guys always say?

32:27.560 --> 32:29.880
You got to wait a little while after a Fedora release

32:29.880 --> 32:31.880
because some of those alternative repos,

32:31.880 --> 32:34.240
other things, proprietary app support,

32:34.240 --> 32:36.600
they might just not be online.

32:36.600 --> 32:38.640
But here you go, not very long after the release.

32:38.640 --> 32:40.240
I mean, flat packs.

32:40.240 --> 32:44.320
And COPR is now making it so easy for people

32:44.320 --> 32:45.520
to update to the next release.

32:45.520 --> 32:48.120
It's a checkbox to build for the next.

32:48.120 --> 32:49.200
I mean, it's great.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.000
You're right, Drew.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.080
And Wes, you're right.

32:51.080 --> 32:54.000
This is not something that should be missed here.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.600
This is week one of Fedora 30.

32:56.600 --> 33:00.120
And I'm up and working with all of the applications I need.

33:00.120 --> 33:01.320
Granted, it's Intel.

33:01.320 --> 33:02.320
It's Intel hardware.

33:02.320 --> 33:03.760
It's Intel video.

33:03.760 --> 33:05.880
But I've got literally every application

33:05.880 --> 33:06.680
I need to do my job.

33:06.680 --> 33:09.160
I saw you sit down and configure basically the whole thing.

33:09.160 --> 33:10.080
In like 15 minutes.

33:10.080 --> 33:11.240
It did not take very long.

33:11.240 --> 33:12.820
And the great thing about Anaconda,

33:12.820 --> 33:15.440
because you're answering a bunch of questions like time zone

33:15.440 --> 33:18.480
and user and root password and all that in keyboard layout,

33:18.480 --> 33:20.800
you're answering all of that while it's writing the images

33:20.800 --> 33:21.400
to disk.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.740
So by the time you get done answering all of those things,

33:23.740 --> 33:26.160
you're like at 80% installed.

33:26.160 --> 33:28.320
And you just sit back for like three minutes.

33:28.320 --> 33:30.240
And then another 15 minutes after that,

33:30.240 --> 33:32.760
I had a fully configured XFCE desktop

33:32.760 --> 33:35.480
that I am genuinely happy with.

33:35.480 --> 33:37.440
It's just great from top to bottom,

33:37.440 --> 33:40.440
from the hardware, which runs cooler now, the battery

33:40.440 --> 33:41.560
life, which is better.

33:41.560 --> 33:42.840
I got two days.

33:42.840 --> 33:44.280
I'm not even shitting you.

33:44.280 --> 33:48.360
I got two days of battery life at Linux Fest Northwest.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.040
Recording audio, right?

33:50.040 --> 33:52.040
So it's not just like my laptop was sitting there.

33:52.040 --> 33:54.760
Actually, it's doing some work shuffling bytes around.

33:54.760 --> 33:57.560
I have the screen set to about 25%, 30%

33:57.560 --> 34:03.200
running Fedora 30 XFCE Audacity recording from a USB audio

34:03.200 --> 34:08.580
interface for two days straight on one battery charge.

34:08.580 --> 34:10.240
So the battery life is phenomenal.

34:10.240 --> 34:11.640
The machine runs cooler.

34:11.640 --> 34:13.760
The Fedora install is clean and simple.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.600
And XFCE is light and efficient.

34:15.600 --> 34:18.320
It's a brilliant setup.

34:18.320 --> 34:19.880
All right, what's wrong with it?

34:19.880 --> 34:21.480
Well, if you have a high DPI monitor,

34:21.480 --> 34:22.780
it's not going to work for you.

34:22.780 --> 34:26.560
That's probably the biggest flaw with my setup right now.

34:26.560 --> 34:28.560
That's really it, is that XFCE really

34:28.560 --> 34:31.680
falls down with high DPI, where Gnome Shell shines.

34:31.680 --> 34:33.600
And if you have a high DPI display,

34:33.600 --> 34:34.800
it's sort of a deal breaker.

34:34.800 --> 34:36.880
I think that's the biggest drawback right now.

34:36.880 --> 34:39.460
And didn't you have a default browser issue as well?

34:39.460 --> 34:39.960
I did.

34:39.960 --> 34:40.460
Oh, yeah.

34:40.460 --> 34:40.960
Thank you.

34:40.960 --> 34:45.200
I also had a, I can't, I think I did fix this now.

34:45.200 --> 34:46.120
But I had an issue.

34:46.120 --> 34:48.360
Even though I installed Chrome, every link

34:48.360 --> 34:50.720
I would click from any application in XFCE

34:50.720 --> 34:52.040
would launch Firefox.

34:52.040 --> 34:53.320
That's a little bit frustrating.

34:53.320 --> 34:56.080
Even in the preferred applications, I had Chrome set.

34:56.080 --> 34:58.080
You were kind of watching you wander around,

34:58.080 --> 35:01.160
like I set it over here, I set it over here.

35:01.160 --> 35:03.520
I changed the mime types to point to Chrome.

35:03.520 --> 35:05.120
I went all in.

35:05.120 --> 35:07.160
And I think I eventually, it was something like change

35:07.160 --> 35:07.720
alternatives.

35:07.720 --> 35:08.520
I can't remember now.

35:08.520 --> 35:09.200
Update alternatives.

35:09.200 --> 35:10.000
Update alternatives.

35:10.000 --> 35:10.560
That's what it was.

35:10.560 --> 35:12.020
And I think that finally fixed it.

35:12.020 --> 35:15.680
But there was a bit of hunting and pecking and solving

35:15.680 --> 35:17.280
that I did not have to do with Subuntu

35:17.280 --> 35:19.040
that I had to do on the Fedora side.

35:19.040 --> 35:22.240
But it was all within about a 15, 20 minute window.

35:22.240 --> 35:24.720
And I was prepared to spend an evening.

35:24.720 --> 35:25.720
So that's not so bad.

35:25.720 --> 35:28.320
And hey, you know how it works now.

35:28.320 --> 35:29.440
I'll tell you what.

35:29.440 --> 35:32.160
I was looking at some of the different spins of Fedora.

35:32.160 --> 35:34.440
And one name keeps popping up on these a lot.

35:34.440 --> 35:35.040
It's Niels.

35:35.040 --> 35:36.820
But there was a few I looked at.

35:36.820 --> 35:38.600
I wanted to give a special mention to two,

35:38.600 --> 35:40.600
the Fedora Security Lab, which is pretty neat.

35:40.600 --> 35:43.040
I loaded that in a VM and gave it a go.

35:43.040 --> 35:44.520
It's like you would expect.

35:44.520 --> 35:47.540
It is a version of Fedora loaded with a bunch of security tools

35:47.540 --> 35:50.920
and scripts to do network penetration testing and whatnot.

35:50.920 --> 35:52.240
And it's a really cool addition.

35:52.240 --> 35:55.240
Security Lab, we'll have a link to that in the show notes.

35:55.240 --> 35:57.280
I also tried out, because I wanted to compare it

35:57.280 --> 36:02.360
to the XFCE desktop, I tried out the LXQt spin of Fedora.

36:02.360 --> 36:05.160
And it's also very fast, very lightweight.

36:05.160 --> 36:06.840
It's really, really great.

36:06.840 --> 36:09.120
I prefer GTK applications a little bit.

36:09.120 --> 36:11.160
So XFCE is kind of the way I went.

36:11.160 --> 36:13.680
But this was a great spin.

36:13.680 --> 36:15.360
But before we get to Silverblue, which

36:15.360 --> 36:17.280
I think is what we all need to talk about here

36:17.280 --> 36:19.360
while we're talking Fedora 30, I think

36:19.360 --> 36:22.000
we should talk a little bit about some of these other spins,

36:22.000 --> 36:23.640
like the Pantheon edition.

36:23.640 --> 36:26.120
It's not officially a spin yet, but you can install it,

36:26.120 --> 36:27.160
as well as a few others.

36:27.160 --> 36:30.120
And Neil, your name's all over these things when I look at it.

36:30.120 --> 36:33.440
What is your hot take right now on Fedora 30?

36:33.440 --> 36:36.240
And a disclaimer, Neil is a contributor

36:36.240 --> 36:38.440
to Fedora, as well as just about every other project

36:38.440 --> 36:39.600
on the freaking planet.

36:39.600 --> 36:41.480
But a big contributor, Fedora.

36:41.480 --> 36:43.840
So Neil, what do you think about the new Pantheon

36:43.840 --> 36:45.680
packages that are installable and the other spins

36:45.680 --> 36:46.120
that are out there?

36:46.120 --> 36:47.680
What's your hot take, as it were?

36:47.680 --> 36:49.320
Well, I'm actually really excited.

36:49.320 --> 36:53.560
So for the Pantheon desktop, we started this work

36:53.560 --> 36:56.920
with Fabio Valentini, who is the main driver and main

36:56.920 --> 36:58.560
contributor to all of this stuff.

36:58.560 --> 37:04.200
He was doing this back in Fedora 25, 26

37:04.200 --> 37:05.520
when we started this.

37:05.520 --> 37:08.160
And over the course of the last few Fedora releases,

37:08.160 --> 37:09.920
we've just been bulking it up and getting

37:09.920 --> 37:11.560
the basic environment up and going.

37:11.560 --> 37:13.480
And it's just been pretty awesome.

37:13.480 --> 37:15.000
We worked with the elementary OS people

37:15.000 --> 37:17.800
to fix issues that cropped up.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.360
We made it a little bit more portable.

37:19.360 --> 37:21.280
We've contributed things all over the place.

37:21.280 --> 37:23.520
What was the reception from the elementary OS project?

37:23.520 --> 37:25.160
How did they feel about you doing this?

37:25.160 --> 37:27.880
So initially, they were kind of cool to it.

37:27.880 --> 37:31.760
But when we started showing up and providing suggestions,

37:31.760 --> 37:34.200
patches, and actually legit feedback

37:34.200 --> 37:36.480
that not only benefited us in the Fedora side,

37:36.480 --> 37:41.040
but also helping them to make their elementary OS better,

37:41.040 --> 37:42.680
they warmed up pretty quickly to that.

37:42.680 --> 37:45.440
And we've got a fair number of advocates

37:45.440 --> 37:49.080
within the elementary OS team who like the stuff that we do.

37:49.080 --> 37:50.880
And so they're huge fans.

37:50.880 --> 37:51.680
That's awesome.

37:51.680 --> 37:53.720
Yeah, in particular, I want to give a shout out

37:53.720 --> 37:57.480
to Cody Garver, who's the quote unquote system

37:57.480 --> 37:59.720
architect for elementary OS.

37:59.720 --> 38:01.480
He and I have been working closely together

38:01.480 --> 38:04.640
for a couple of years now, along with Fabio,

38:04.640 --> 38:07.240
working on getting all those pieces in place.

38:07.240 --> 38:10.480
And now he manages actually the infrastructure

38:10.480 --> 38:14.040
for producing elementary OS, all the distro patching,

38:14.040 --> 38:15.880
the releasing of all the applications,

38:15.880 --> 38:16.800
and things like that.

38:16.800 --> 38:18.560
And so we worked with him to make sure

38:18.560 --> 38:21.600
that whatever we needed to do to get things fixed

38:21.600 --> 38:24.080
would also work OK on elementary OS's side,

38:24.080 --> 38:28.520
and generally benefit both of us as a whole.

38:28.520 --> 38:31.800
If I wasn't being too presumptuous, I could say,

38:31.800 --> 38:36.920
Fedora's Pantheon desktop is, barring a few things that

38:36.920 --> 38:40.080
are kind of missing due to some quirks and other problems,

38:40.080 --> 38:45.280
is actually about the same level in terms of integration

38:45.280 --> 38:50.800
and polish as what elementary OS was, or is.

38:50.800 --> 38:54.320
That does seem like a bold statement, my friend.

38:54.320 --> 38:56.960
Part of that is being a little bit presumptuous in the sense

38:56.960 --> 38:58.360
that it's not complete.

38:58.360 --> 39:01.000
It doesn't have all the pieces that the elementary OS

39:01.000 --> 39:02.320
experience offers.

39:02.320 --> 39:05.120
For example, unfortunately, App Center

39:05.120 --> 39:06.920
had to be removed for Fedora 30.

39:06.920 --> 39:08.260
There were a bunch of things that

39:08.260 --> 39:11.360
just kind of broke to the point that we needed to pull it out.

39:11.360 --> 39:15.200
It'll be reintroduced later in the Fedora 30 lifecycle.

39:15.200 --> 39:18.000
There'll be a few other things that we're still working on

39:18.000 --> 39:20.240
and chewing through to try to fix.

39:20.240 --> 39:24.000
But it's the most complete experience we've had in a while.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.440
The fact that elementary OS is introducing flat pack support

39:26.440 --> 39:29.280
in the near future will actually make things a little bit more

39:29.280 --> 39:30.600
interesting for us.

39:30.600 --> 39:36.360
There is an old-ish branch somewhere of App Center

39:36.360 --> 39:37.720
with Snap support as well.

39:37.720 --> 39:41.840
And as you may be aware, I am the Snap maintainer for Fedora.

39:41.840 --> 39:44.560
And I have all the integration pieces in place

39:44.560 --> 39:45.880
for being able to enable that.

39:45.880 --> 39:47.960
So one thing we could potentially be looking at

39:47.960 --> 39:49.720
is having all the things.

39:49.720 --> 39:53.920
What's the official story on the, I guess,

39:53.920 --> 39:57.040
what seems to me to be the fundamental issue with Snaps

39:57.040 --> 40:01.240
on Fedora in that they are built around confinement provided

40:01.240 --> 40:02.440
by App Armor.

40:02.440 --> 40:05.600
And Fedora uses SELinux, not App Armor.

40:05.600 --> 40:07.400
So is there some sort of shim that

40:07.400 --> 40:11.120
can be created where App Armor gets translated SELinux?

40:11.120 --> 40:12.560
Is something like that even possible?

40:12.560 --> 40:16.800
Or is Fedora going to be a Snap confinement-free zone?

40:16.800 --> 40:18.160
I hope not.

40:18.160 --> 40:20.080
That defeats the point.

40:20.080 --> 40:22.880
So what most people don't understand

40:22.880 --> 40:27.080
is that Snap is not App Armor native either.

40:27.080 --> 40:31.080
What it does is it has an abstract set of permissions.

40:31.080 --> 40:34.400
Similar to how Android and other mobile OSes work,

40:34.400 --> 40:35.960
it kind of works that way.

40:35.960 --> 40:38.440
And internally, it translates into a mixture

40:38.440 --> 40:40.400
of set comp and App Armor rules.

40:40.400 --> 40:45.960
Now, the App Armor stuff only fully works on Ubuntu

40:45.960 --> 40:50.280
because they have their own changes that are not upstreamed.

40:50.280 --> 40:53.440
And it's been that way forevermore.

40:53.440 --> 40:57.440
But it'll maybe someday change.

40:57.440 --> 40:59.160
But the set comp stuff works.

40:59.160 --> 41:05.720
And there is upcoming in the next feature release,

41:05.720 --> 41:11.320
2.39, the very most basic support for SELinux.

41:11.320 --> 41:12.720
It doesn't do much.

41:12.720 --> 41:17.280
It just mainly enhances the confinement of the SnapD part.

41:17.280 --> 41:19.840
And the Snap confined tools are appropriately guarded.

41:19.840 --> 41:21.920
And so it doesn't throw all kinds of crazy errors

41:21.920 --> 41:23.160
all over the place.

41:23.160 --> 41:24.720
But it's a starting place.

41:24.720 --> 41:26.920
And the idea is that we can build from this.

41:26.920 --> 41:28.600
And if people are interested in making

41:28.600 --> 41:32.120
this work better in Fedora, they can

41:32.120 --> 41:37.040
help with developing this SELinux backend for the SnapD

41:37.040 --> 41:40.080
security system, the Snap confined system.

41:40.080 --> 41:44.600
So there is now the potential in Git Master

41:44.600 --> 41:47.200
for a proper SELinux backend.

41:47.200 --> 41:48.440
It links to libSELinux.

41:48.440 --> 41:50.480
It just doesn't do much with it yet.

41:50.480 --> 41:52.720
And there may be some development that needs to happen

41:52.720 --> 41:54.640
upstream in the SELinux side.

41:54.640 --> 41:57.120
Unfortunately, while I know how to write SELinux policies

41:57.120 --> 42:01.000
and I'm pretty good at it, I can do the security stuff

42:01.000 --> 42:03.800
as good as any other sysadmin who

42:03.800 --> 42:05.400
has to do this kind of thing.

42:05.400 --> 42:08.480
I'm not that good at being able to write

42:08.480 --> 42:12.280
into complex integration logic, translating mechanisms

42:12.280 --> 42:14.320
backwards and forwards, and dealing

42:14.320 --> 42:16.560
with all of those moving parts.

42:16.560 --> 42:18.160
That's not my forte, unfortunately.

42:18.160 --> 42:19.200
No, come on.

42:19.200 --> 42:22.080
All right, well, let me get your hot take on Fedora 30.

42:22.080 --> 42:23.800
Just sort of high level.

42:23.800 --> 42:25.400
What are you pumped about?

42:25.400 --> 42:28.400
And what should we know about that we haven't touched on?

42:28.400 --> 42:30.840
So there's a couple of things that I'm really pumped about.

42:30.840 --> 42:33.360
One of them is it's a really low level piece.

42:33.360 --> 42:34.720
But then again, if you know me, you

42:34.720 --> 42:37.080
know that I love the low level pieces.

42:37.080 --> 42:40.520
We changed the way that grub is configured in Fedora 30

42:40.520 --> 42:46.400
by default. So if you're installing Fedora 30,

42:46.400 --> 42:48.280
your grub configuration will be changed

42:48.280 --> 42:50.120
to using what's called the bootloader spec, which

42:50.120 --> 42:52.880
is something that's been floating around for a few years.

42:52.880 --> 42:55.360
The biggest thing that makes this interesting

42:55.360 --> 42:59.920
is that now all of the loader entries in grub,

42:59.920 --> 43:02.440
or any of the other bootloaders that we would configure,

43:02.440 --> 43:05.760
but mainly grub, are now drop-in files.

43:05.760 --> 43:09.160
And they're compatible with both grub and SD boot.

43:09.160 --> 43:11.640
So if you were on an EFI system, you

43:11.640 --> 43:16.040
could choose between grub or system dboot.

43:16.040 --> 43:18.600
And the configurations would work exactly the same.

43:18.600 --> 43:21.480
But for the most part, it is grub that you're usually using.

43:21.480 --> 43:23.520
It's the one we officially support right now.

43:23.520 --> 43:25.400
But the option is now there.

43:25.400 --> 43:28.000
And there's other boot managers out there in the EFI space

43:28.000 --> 43:32.560
that would be able to support using those drop-in files.

43:32.560 --> 43:36.720
So the big thing is that now that we have that,

43:36.720 --> 43:39.280
we can make it so that we don't have to clobber each other all

43:39.280 --> 43:41.560
the time as other distributions begin

43:41.560 --> 43:43.720
to adopt the bootloader spec.

43:43.720 --> 43:45.720
I've heard from a couple of contributors

43:45.720 --> 43:48.600
on the OpenSUSE side that are interested in bringing

43:48.600 --> 43:51.440
our patches to grub and other pieces

43:51.440 --> 43:54.600
to make it so that the bootloader spec is supported

43:54.600 --> 43:57.480
in OpenSUSE Tumbleweed and adapting YAST

43:57.480 --> 43:59.760
so that it generates bootloader spec entries rather

43:59.760 --> 44:02.520
than manipulating grub.

44:02.520 --> 44:04.600
By doing that, then Fedora and OpenSUSE

44:04.600 --> 44:07.240
can sit side by side without clobbering each other.

44:07.240 --> 44:11.080
And because I already integrated the patches for dealing

44:11.080 --> 44:15.560
with SUSE's boot to snapshot into the Fedora grub,

44:15.560 --> 44:19.560
some time ago, any design that we work on for supporting this

44:19.560 --> 44:22.480
should be able to work on both Fedora and OpenSUSE properly.

44:22.480 --> 44:25.800
But you're still using FreeBSD on your main desktop, right?

44:25.800 --> 44:26.800
Hell no.

44:26.800 --> 44:29.160
What do you take me for?

44:29.160 --> 44:31.360
How great would it have been if you'd said yes, though?

44:31.360 --> 44:32.800
That would have been so funny.

44:32.800 --> 44:36.120
I can't even do that as a joke, and you know it.

44:36.120 --> 44:38.080
But yeah, bootloader spec is one of the big things

44:38.080 --> 44:39.320
that I'm excited about.

44:39.320 --> 44:40.920
And the other thing I'm excited about

44:40.920 --> 44:44.640
is that we're murdering Python 2 in its sleep piece by piece.

44:44.640 --> 44:47.680
Yeah, go on on that, because I touched on that briefly.

44:47.680 --> 44:49.160
So I'm one of the people that have

44:49.160 --> 44:51.320
been working on murdering Python 2 in its sleep.

44:51.320 --> 44:54.160
If you look at the change entry, my name is mentioned.

44:54.160 --> 44:55.680
That's awful, but very good.

44:55.680 --> 45:00.400
So what we've done for Fedora 30 is that we've gone through

45:00.400 --> 45:02.960
and we've looked at the chains of things

45:02.960 --> 45:06.520
that were available in Python 2 and Python 3,

45:06.520 --> 45:08.840
and nothing was using the Python 2 part.

45:08.840 --> 45:10.520
And we went and deleted them.

45:10.520 --> 45:15.800
And I think we've cut a little over maybe 1,500 or so Python

45:15.800 --> 45:18.000
2 modules and packages.

45:18.000 --> 45:21.960
Also, we ported a number of Fedora infrastructure software

45:21.960 --> 45:23.440
from Python 2 to Python 3.

45:23.440 --> 45:26.200
So for example, the Koji build system is now Python 3,

45:26.200 --> 45:27.640
except for a small piece of it that

45:27.640 --> 45:29.600
still needs to be Python 2 for now.

45:29.600 --> 45:33.920
That will be fixed, hopefully, soon.

45:33.920 --> 45:37.920
Our update system, a lot of our compose process tools,

45:37.920 --> 45:40.880
our imaging tools across the board,

45:40.880 --> 45:44.360
like we've done a very drastic switch from Python 2

45:44.360 --> 45:45.560
to Python 3.

45:45.560 --> 45:47.320
I think the only thing that we currently

45:47.320 --> 45:50.080
have in production at this point that's still running on Python

45:50.080 --> 45:57.280
2 is the Fedora account system and the Pagar servers, which

45:57.280 --> 45:59.520
are running on CentOS 7.

45:59.520 --> 46:03.400
Or, well, FAS is running on CentOS 6, or RHEL 6, sorry.

46:03.400 --> 46:04.840
We're actually running on RHEL.

46:04.840 --> 46:09.320
They're running on RHEL 6, and the Pagar servers

46:09.320 --> 46:11.680
are running on RHEL 7.

46:11.680 --> 46:13.120
And so those are the only pieces,

46:13.120 --> 46:14.480
I think, that are still running on Python 2,

46:14.480 --> 46:17.840
because Python 3 hasn't been introduced into RHEL 7 base,

46:17.840 --> 46:20.160
which is coming in the next point.

46:20.160 --> 46:21.720
It's coming in the next point release.

46:21.720 --> 46:23.400
There's a Red Hat bug for it, which

46:23.400 --> 46:28.160
I can provide you a link later to show that it is coming.

46:28.160 --> 46:31.000
So that will help accelerate the death of Python 2,

46:31.000 --> 46:33.760
because it's been used as an excuse for a long time

46:33.760 --> 46:37.560
to not port things, because Red Hat isn't supporting Python 3

46:37.560 --> 46:39.120
in the RHEL 7.

46:39.120 --> 46:41.200
No, no, no, it is.

46:41.200 --> 46:42.600
Port your crap.

46:42.600 --> 46:45.240
And that's a new shirt right there, port your crap.

46:45.240 --> 46:47.360
All right, well, Neil, thank you very much.

46:47.360 --> 46:52.400
Now, continuing along this theme, live here on the show,

46:52.400 --> 46:53.280
prepare yourself.

46:53.280 --> 46:57.560
You ready for this, Mr. Wes Payne?

46:57.560 --> 47:01.800
Can you upgrade one of our most critical servers

47:01.800 --> 47:05.480
in the Jupyter broadcasting infrastructure to Fedora 30

47:05.480 --> 47:08.080
live on the podcast?

47:08.080 --> 47:11.080
I think it's going to be a question of timing, I'm afraid.

47:11.080 --> 47:12.760
Well, we're doing our updates right now,

47:12.760 --> 47:14.880
just to get to a nice up-to-date set up, right?

47:14.880 --> 47:17.760
Oh, OK, yeah, OK, so we were a little behind on the updates.

47:17.760 --> 47:19.640
Not too far, but we had some to do, yeah.

47:19.640 --> 47:21.720
I mean, we've been busy, right, LinuxFest Northwest?

47:21.720 --> 47:23.520
Yeah, blame it on that.

47:23.520 --> 47:27.880
Not the months beforehand where we didn't do any updates.

47:27.880 --> 47:31.280
And then there's a DNF plug-in for doing the system upgrade.

47:31.280 --> 47:34.480
So once we're there, I mean, can I do it?

47:34.480 --> 47:36.360
I can certainly run the command.

47:36.360 --> 47:37.760
OK, when do you think?

47:37.760 --> 47:39.320
Do you think you'll get it before the end of the show?

47:39.320 --> 47:41.880
We're chugging along right now, so there's only one way

47:41.880 --> 47:42.400
to find out.

47:42.400 --> 47:43.480
All right, we'll come back to that.

47:43.480 --> 47:44.160
We'll come back to that.

47:44.160 --> 47:45.480
Stand by, we'll see.

47:45.480 --> 47:45.960
We'll see.

47:45.960 --> 47:48.080
Before we go, Alex, did you have anything

47:48.080 --> 47:50.520
to add to our Fedora blowout here?

47:50.520 --> 47:53.120
I know you're potentially, possibly,

47:53.120 --> 47:54.720
rumor has it, a Fedora user.

47:54.720 --> 47:56.320
Yeah, rumor has it.

47:56.320 --> 47:58.240
So there's been a really interesting development

47:58.240 --> 48:02.720
with something called Fedora Silverblue, actually.

48:02.720 --> 48:06.920
And it's the love child of CoreOS and Fedora.

48:06.920 --> 48:10.320
So it's an immutable desktop OS.

48:10.320 --> 48:14.000
And we've had several immutable server distros,

48:14.000 --> 48:18.600
such as Project Atomic and Rancher, for a while now.

48:18.600 --> 48:20.600
And Silverblue is aimed at those of you

48:20.600 --> 48:22.520
with container-based workflows.

48:22.520 --> 48:27.320
And it targets the development communities above all others.

48:27.320 --> 48:30.520
There's a few things I like about RPMOS Tree.

48:30.520 --> 48:34.840
You can have Atomic upgrades, which is really nice.

48:34.840 --> 48:37.480
Let's say an upgrade balks your system.

48:37.480 --> 48:40.880
It's really easy to roll back with Atomic.

48:40.880 --> 48:45.280
So the way that works is you boot from partition A

48:45.280 --> 48:46.800
into your operating system.

48:46.800 --> 48:51.840
You then use RPMOS Tree to install a new image

48:51.840 --> 48:56.120
onto partition B. Reboot into partition B,

48:56.120 --> 48:59.400
leaving A untouched so that if ever there's an issue,

48:59.400 --> 49:01.760
you just fall back to partition A.

49:01.760 --> 49:04.560
And there's no practical limit on the number of images

49:04.560 --> 49:07.160
that you can have available for this purpose.

49:07.160 --> 49:12.400
So you could reboot to partition Q if you wanted to.

49:12.400 --> 49:16.400
So it allows you to switch between different versions.

49:16.400 --> 49:17.480
I'm doing air quotes.

49:17.480 --> 49:19.880
You can't see it.

49:19.880 --> 49:23.040
Different versions of Fedora, different spins, if you like.

49:23.040 --> 49:25.960
So you could switch between a version of Fedora

49:25.960 --> 49:31.240
but maybe had LXDE included, LXQT, sorry,

49:31.240 --> 49:34.360
included versus XFCE just by rebooting

49:34.360 --> 49:36.800
into a different partition or a different image,

49:36.800 --> 49:37.920
which makes it really nice.

49:37.920 --> 49:38.800
Yeah.

49:38.800 --> 49:41.480
You can layer legacy applications,

49:41.480 --> 49:43.120
package just RPMs over the top.

49:43.120 --> 49:45.680
So that might include things like fonts and printer drivers,

49:45.680 --> 49:46.840
et cetera.

49:46.840 --> 49:49.560
So there is still support for the old school type things.

49:49.560 --> 49:53.160
But the primary method for delivering software

49:53.160 --> 49:56.480
on Silverblue is flat packs.

49:56.480 --> 49:58.840
So we're all familiar with snaps and flat packs and stuff

49:58.840 --> 50:00.160
on this show, I hope, by now.

50:00.160 --> 50:02.160
Even command line applications?

50:02.160 --> 50:03.200
Yes, I believe so.

50:03.200 --> 50:06.520
Things like Vim delivered as a flat pack.

50:06.520 --> 50:07.920
Oh.

50:07.920 --> 50:08.840
Yeah.

50:08.840 --> 50:11.240
So it's really, like I said before,

50:11.240 --> 50:13.160
the love child of CoreOS and Fedora.

50:13.160 --> 50:15.840
And there's some really, really cool stuff in there, yeah.

50:15.840 --> 50:17.760
Yeah, that is a kind of beautiful thing to see.

50:17.760 --> 50:21.560
And it's something that we've been watching pretty carefully.

50:21.560 --> 50:24.640
And I don't know, it's nice to meet.

50:24.640 --> 50:27.400
Can you be our, what do you think, Alex?

50:27.400 --> 50:30.320
Will you be our Silverblue correspondent?

50:30.320 --> 50:31.800
Yes.

50:31.800 --> 50:32.960
Yeah, I like that.

50:32.960 --> 50:35.440
You sound really dedicated.

50:35.440 --> 50:39.080
Oh, I just got the thumbs up from Mr. Westpain.

50:39.080 --> 50:41.560
All right, here we go, ladies and gentlemen.

50:41.560 --> 50:42.520
We're at the prompt.

50:42.520 --> 50:44.520
Do you want to continue?

50:44.520 --> 50:45.480
Yes.

50:45.480 --> 50:46.280
Yes, we do.

50:46.280 --> 50:47.520
I hit Y.

50:47.520 --> 50:48.840
All right, and Enter.

50:48.840 --> 50:49.760
Now, away we go.

50:49.760 --> 50:50.720
And what do we got here?

50:50.720 --> 50:52.560
We're downloading some packages.

50:52.560 --> 50:54.440
Yeah, we're doing some updates first.

50:54.440 --> 50:55.600
Yep, see, we've set up, right?

50:55.600 --> 50:57.960
We're moving to the Fedora 30 repos instead of 29.

50:57.960 --> 51:00.200
So you've installed the DNF upgrade plugin.

51:00.200 --> 51:02.800
Yep, and then we run system upgrade.

51:02.800 --> 51:04.360
Why don't we break this down a little bit?

51:04.360 --> 51:06.320
So the way this works on Fedora

51:06.320 --> 51:09.160
is not necessarily the way it works on Debian,

51:09.160 --> 51:12.760
where you can do a dist upgrade and you can start off.

51:12.760 --> 51:15.600
This actually, you kind of have to tell DNF,

51:15.600 --> 51:18.280
hey buddy, it's time to switch over to 30.

51:18.280 --> 51:19.240
Yeah, exactly.

51:19.240 --> 51:21.800
So now we've started downloading all the new stuff.

51:21.800 --> 51:23.480
So right now we're just in the download state

51:23.480 --> 51:24.680
getting all the packages we'll want

51:24.680 --> 51:26.480
as we upgrade to the new release.

51:26.480 --> 51:30.160
And once that's finished, we'll run system upgrade reboot,

51:30.160 --> 51:32.720
and then it'll reboot and actually upgrade us

51:32.720 --> 51:33.760
and get us to a Fedora 30.

51:33.760 --> 51:37.320
And is it using system D in some way to do this?

51:37.320 --> 51:40.240
My understanding is that it is for the upgrade process,

51:40.240 --> 51:44.040
that it reboots and system D takes it into a state

51:44.040 --> 51:46.120
where then it installs all of the packages

51:46.120 --> 51:47.440
and then reboots again.

51:47.440 --> 51:49.640
Some fancy stuff they do.

51:49.640 --> 51:50.480
It really is.

51:50.480 --> 51:52.440
You know, kind of like Windows a little bit

51:52.440 --> 51:54.640
where you got to do the package upgrades offline,

51:54.640 --> 51:56.700
but I guess it's safer not to have that stuff

51:56.700 --> 51:57.540
loaded in memory.

51:57.540 --> 51:59.360
And I mean, one of the nice things about Fedora

51:59.360 --> 52:01.360
is you upgrade a lot.

52:01.360 --> 52:03.040
So you need it to be reliable,

52:03.040 --> 52:06.540
but it can be reliable because it is actually happening.

52:06.540 --> 52:08.960
It's not, you know, how many Ubuntu users do you know

52:08.960 --> 52:12.480
that skip a few LTSs and they're going from a 12 to an 18,

52:12.480 --> 52:13.560
and it's really painful.

52:13.560 --> 52:14.880
Well, you can't really do that on Fedora.

52:14.880 --> 52:16.680
You don't have five years either, right?

52:16.680 --> 52:18.260
So you've got to keep it up to date.

52:18.260 --> 52:21.240
And that's one of the deals you make

52:21.240 --> 52:22.800
when you deploy a Fedora system.

52:22.800 --> 52:25.860
And our system here, the Orbital system that we have,

52:25.860 --> 52:27.780
that is one of our most valuable machines

52:27.780 --> 52:32.040
that runs many containers that supply production services,

52:32.040 --> 52:33.540
that supply encoding services,

52:33.540 --> 52:36.520
that run the Casta Blast automated encoding system.

52:36.520 --> 52:39.200
All of that is a series of different containers

52:39.200 --> 52:42.100
on our Orbital server running on Fedora 29,

52:42.100 --> 52:43.680
that we are now upgrading to Fedora 30.

52:43.680 --> 52:46.160
If this breaks, we literally will not be able

52:46.160 --> 52:47.200
to publish this show.

52:47.200 --> 52:49.000
I mean, I think Joe is just going to yell at us.

52:49.000 --> 52:50.400
That's going to be the primary outcome.

52:50.400 --> 52:52.040
Please tell me when it's that you took a snapshot

52:52.040 --> 52:53.520
of this before you started.

52:53.520 --> 52:54.340
Yeah, it's-

52:54.340 --> 52:55.180
You did?

52:55.180 --> 52:56.760
Cause we meant to, but I forgot.

52:56.760 --> 52:58.000
I forgot to do that.

52:59.480 --> 53:02.940
Cause if this goes wrong, our FM stream is off the air.

53:02.940 --> 53:04.800
Our publishing system is off the air.

53:04.800 --> 53:06.980
I mean, we're going to have to reboot the FM stream anyway.

53:06.980 --> 53:07.820
So that's-

53:07.820 --> 53:08.640
Are we?

53:08.640 --> 53:09.480
Of course.

53:09.480 --> 53:10.320
Yeah, we're going to reboot the system.

53:10.320 --> 53:11.560
Did you check the disk space though?

53:11.560 --> 53:12.880
That's the question.

53:12.880 --> 53:14.120
Yeah, we're doing fine there.

53:14.120 --> 53:15.080
Okay, all right.

53:15.080 --> 53:16.560
All right, how far are we along now, Wes?

53:16.560 --> 53:18.160
All right, download complete.

53:18.160 --> 53:19.680
Phew.

53:19.680 --> 53:20.720
You know, as we've done this,

53:20.720 --> 53:22.840
it's really hit me how critical this system is.

53:22.840 --> 53:27.440
And if this breaks, we can't use Fedora anymore.

53:27.440 --> 53:28.840
Like if this breaks-

53:28.840 --> 53:29.660
Well, I don't know if that's true.

53:29.660 --> 53:30.800
No, seriously.

53:30.800 --> 53:31.640
Dude, really?

53:31.640 --> 53:32.600
That's pretty extreme.

53:32.600 --> 53:34.840
Have it break every nine months on us or whatever it is?

53:34.840 --> 53:35.680
Really?

53:35.680 --> 53:36.500
That's not-

53:36.500 --> 53:37.520
Well, that's no guarantee it's going to break every time.

53:37.520 --> 53:39.800
If it breaks, I mean, but a five year distribution-

53:39.800 --> 53:42.320
Generally, one takes slightly more precautions

53:42.320 --> 53:43.400
before upgrading-

53:43.400 --> 53:44.240
True.

53:44.240 --> 53:47.160
But a five year distribution by its very nature

53:47.160 --> 53:49.600
needs to be upgraded like this less often

53:49.600 --> 53:51.080
than a Fedora distribution.

53:51.080 --> 53:53.760
And if it breaks once, then that's it for me.

53:53.760 --> 53:54.760
It could break again.

53:54.760 --> 53:57.200
Yeah, it has to be 100% reliable.

53:57.200 --> 53:58.400
That's a myth.

53:58.400 --> 54:00.480
There's no 100% reliability.

54:00.480 --> 54:01.840
It's one thing for an LTS,

54:01.840 --> 54:03.360
like an Ubuntu LTS upgrade to break

54:03.360 --> 54:05.720
because you go five years in between upgrades.

54:05.720 --> 54:08.480
Really, it's always a cost benefit question, right?

54:08.480 --> 54:11.080
There is obviously a cost to having to upgrade more often.

54:11.080 --> 54:13.320
There are upsides too, because, you know,

54:13.320 --> 54:15.520
we just measure, is it worth what we get with Fedora?

54:15.520 --> 54:17.720
You lied to you having cockpit set up and ready to roll.

54:17.720 --> 54:19.120
It was an easy system to manage.

54:19.120 --> 54:20.320
You enjoyed DNF.

54:20.320 --> 54:23.200
I've never had a DNF upgrade fail me yet.

54:24.480 --> 54:26.200
It's just that nothing like this

54:26.200 --> 54:27.200
has ever been on the line before.

54:27.200 --> 54:29.560
I've never had this many important things

54:29.560 --> 54:30.680
on the line before.

54:30.680 --> 54:33.760
Sounds to me like you need to have something ready to go

54:33.760 --> 54:34.800
to replace this system.

54:34.800 --> 54:37.560
Any snowflake that is in that kind of position

54:37.560 --> 54:41.600
that you depend on that much makes me really nervous.

54:41.600 --> 54:43.240
Honestly, we could.

54:43.240 --> 54:44.120
Because it's all containerized.

54:44.120 --> 54:46.480
I mean, we just start all the services somewhere else.

54:46.480 --> 54:47.320
It's fine.

54:47.320 --> 54:48.160
It'll be good.

54:48.160 --> 54:50.600
What version of Fedora did this start out on, by the way?

54:50.600 --> 54:53.000
This one, we might've been a fresh install of 29

54:53.000 --> 54:56.200
because we reconsolidated down onto a Fedora box.

54:56.200 --> 54:57.040
So this one was probably-

54:57.040 --> 54:57.880
There's no ancient behemoth.

54:57.880 --> 55:00.280
Right, but we had been for a long time upgrading

55:00.280 --> 55:01.720
for many, many years.

55:01.720 --> 55:04.120
We just recently decided to start fresh with a new base.

55:04.120 --> 55:05.360
All right, we're ready.

55:05.360 --> 55:06.720
I'm sitting here.

55:06.720 --> 55:07.960
Okay, this is the reboot?

55:07.960 --> 55:08.800
Yeah.

55:08.800 --> 55:09.840
All right, let's do it, Wes.

55:09.840 --> 55:10.680
Hit it.

55:10.680 --> 55:13.960
All right, as I say, it's connection dropped.

55:16.320 --> 55:17.960
Now we just wait.

55:17.960 --> 55:20.400
Now we just wait for it to reboot.

55:20.400 --> 55:21.520
Come on, Fedora.

55:21.520 --> 55:25.120
This is about as on the line as it gets.

55:25.120 --> 55:28.320
And really, it's important that this works

55:28.320 --> 55:30.520
because with the update frequency of Fedora,

55:30.520 --> 55:31.440
this has to work.

55:33.720 --> 55:35.200
Come on.

55:35.200 --> 55:36.400
Not up yet.

55:36.400 --> 55:37.640
It's gotta do all the updates.

55:37.640 --> 55:40.000
It's gotta bring up the console through DigitalOcean.

55:40.000 --> 55:40.840
That's what I'm working on right now.

55:40.840 --> 55:41.680
Okay, good.

55:41.680 --> 55:42.920
All right.

55:42.920 --> 55:45.160
Oh my gosh, Drew, are you totally worried

55:45.160 --> 55:46.240
it's not gonna work right now?

55:46.240 --> 55:48.720
I haven't ever had an experience

55:48.720 --> 55:51.720
where DNF upgrade went horribly wrong.

55:51.720 --> 55:52.560
Oh no.

55:53.480 --> 55:55.560
You know it's gonna go wrong now.

55:55.560 --> 55:58.160
You feel like we got a good shot here?

55:58.160 --> 55:59.360
Yeah, yeah.

55:59.360 --> 56:01.840
Yeah, you don't sound super confident, man.

56:01.840 --> 56:06.160
It has to be better than upgrading from Ubuntu 14.04

56:06.160 --> 56:10.280
to 16.04 where it just rips out PHP without telling you.

56:10.280 --> 56:12.000
Not that you would know, right, Joe?

56:12.000 --> 56:13.320
No, I wouldn't know anything about that.

56:13.320 --> 56:16.080
No, not that I did that with a live production system

56:16.080 --> 56:18.880
and then quickly roll back to a backup or anything.

56:18.880 --> 56:20.000
Well, I'm glad you had a backup.

56:20.000 --> 56:21.520
Good job on you.

56:21.520 --> 56:23.280
That's just admin 101 right there.

56:23.280 --> 56:26.560
Wes, you have a very, very, very serious face right now.

56:26.560 --> 56:28.440
Well, that's just my resting serious face.

56:28.440 --> 56:30.720
Okay, I won't body shame.

56:30.720 --> 56:31.560
I'm sorry.

56:33.160 --> 56:35.800
I'm just very like, I'm reading Wes's face

56:35.800 --> 56:37.200
to try to like interpret like.

56:37.200 --> 56:38.600
Oh, it just rebooted.

56:38.600 --> 56:39.440
Okay, all right.

56:39.440 --> 56:40.280
So we're just.

56:40.280 --> 56:41.400
I'm watching, I got the console up, yeah.

56:41.400 --> 56:42.880
Okay, good, good.

56:42.880 --> 56:44.560
What are you seeing?

56:44.560 --> 56:47.000
Well, just standard, you know, kernel output.

56:47.000 --> 56:48.520
You are. Or detecting devices.

56:48.520 --> 56:50.960
You are as calm as it gets right now.

56:50.960 --> 56:53.160
You are not worried about this at all.

56:53.160 --> 56:54.240
Yeah, it's fine.

56:54.240 --> 56:56.560
I, on the other hand, am having a mild panic attack.

56:56.560 --> 56:57.760
So that's good.

56:57.760 --> 56:59.760
I mean, we got droplets, you know, whatever.

56:59.760 --> 57:00.680
I can spit things out.

57:00.680 --> 57:01.520
This is what I sound like when I'm having.

57:01.520 --> 57:02.800
Sorry, we should have apologized

57:02.800 --> 57:04.400
for one of the FM stream listeners, really.

57:04.400 --> 57:06.320
Oh yeah, we just cut them all off.

57:06.320 --> 57:07.160
This is what I sound like

57:07.160 --> 57:08.680
when I'm having a panic attack, by the way.

57:08.680 --> 57:10.520
I still sound like my regular self.

57:10.520 --> 57:13.220
I'm just exploding with emotions on the inside.

57:15.800 --> 57:17.720
Well, I'm trying to load the upload page

57:17.720 --> 57:20.400
that I used to publish the shows and nothing yet.

57:20.400 --> 57:22.880
Yeah, that means the containers haven't started yet.

57:22.880 --> 57:24.600
That's for the cast a blast system.

57:24.600 --> 57:27.240
Oh God, Wes, oh God.

57:27.240 --> 57:28.080
Oh my God.

57:28.080 --> 57:29.360
I mean, we've had a clean disc mount.

57:29.360 --> 57:30.700
That's always good.

57:30.700 --> 57:31.540
I gotta come over and look.

57:31.540 --> 57:35.000
I gotta come over here and look, stand by.

57:35.000 --> 57:36.720
Okay, all right.

57:36.720 --> 57:38.200
That's just a bunch of system D,

57:38.200 --> 57:40.160
that's just a bunch of system D air messages

57:40.160 --> 57:41.080
on the screen right now.

57:41.080 --> 57:42.800
I mean, they're audit log.

57:42.800 --> 57:43.640
Oh my God.

57:43.640 --> 57:45.740
I just broke one of our most important servers

57:45.740 --> 57:47.080
for a stupid bit on the show.

57:47.080 --> 57:51.360
It's probably system D SE Linux auto relabeling everything.

57:51.360 --> 57:53.840
So just calm yourself, calm your boots.

57:55.360 --> 57:57.520
Okay, all right, I'll go with that.

57:57.520 --> 57:59.760
I like that Drew has legitimately gotten up

57:59.760 --> 58:01.720
out of his seat away from the microphone

58:01.720 --> 58:02.760
so that way he can watch.

58:02.760 --> 58:06.000
Yeah, he's pacing watching Wes's screen right now.

58:06.000 --> 58:09.160
Oh my gosh, Wes, I am literally about to explode.

58:09.160 --> 58:11.160
Please tell me something here.

58:11.160 --> 58:12.760
Oh God.

58:12.760 --> 58:13.920
I mean, it's detecting stuff.

58:13.920 --> 58:16.040
We've figured out we're running under KVM.

58:16.040 --> 58:17.860
Oh God, okay.

58:17.860 --> 58:21.720
So yeah, I mean, it looks like a normal

58:21.720 --> 58:23.520
post upgrade boot process.

58:23.520 --> 58:25.200
It just has a lot to do.

58:25.200 --> 58:26.040
Yeah, surely there's plenty of things going on.

58:26.040 --> 58:27.700
That doesn't look normal.

58:27.700 --> 58:31.380
I've done a lot of Fedora updates.

58:31.380 --> 58:33.580
All those system D messages don't look normal.

58:33.580 --> 58:35.620
Well, there's a lot more system D these days.

58:35.620 --> 58:39.020
I mean, it has taken, eaten over the entire Linux system.

58:39.020 --> 58:41.420
It's usually just a bunch of packages getting upgraded

58:41.420 --> 58:42.700
and then your kernel gets updated,

58:42.700 --> 58:44.860
your grub entries get updated and it reboots.

58:44.860 --> 58:47.100
That's usually what it is.

58:47.100 --> 58:48.540
It's not coming up.

58:48.540 --> 58:49.620
I think we've killed the system

58:49.620 --> 58:51.500
and we need to acknowledge that we have just killed

58:51.500 --> 58:54.020
our production server trying to upgrade to Fedora 30.

58:54.020 --> 58:55.680
So about that snapshot, Wes.

58:55.680 --> 59:00.680
We just had Fedora 30 kill our box.

59:00.860 --> 59:02.740
I mean, we got to wait a while.

59:02.740 --> 59:04.860
We've been here like two minutes, three minutes.

59:04.860 --> 59:06.040
It's been a long time, dude.

59:06.040 --> 59:07.380
And this is a digital ocean droplet

59:07.380 --> 59:09.660
with a massive connection and a fast SSD.

59:11.900 --> 59:13.900
I think we've killed the box.

59:13.900 --> 59:14.740
Oh my God.

59:14.740 --> 59:16.180
It is taking a little while.

59:16.180 --> 59:17.980
I'll give you that.

59:17.980 --> 59:20.780
This music is making it way more tense too though.

59:23.860 --> 59:25.180
Wes, I think this is it.

59:25.180 --> 59:27.140
I think we got to call it.

59:27.140 --> 59:28.420
I think we've killed Orbital.

59:28.420 --> 59:30.480
Yeah, and you'll just have to tune in

59:30.480 --> 59:33.500
and see what the fallout was next episode.

59:35.700 --> 59:37.260
Are they able to publish?

59:37.260 --> 59:38.500
Wait and see.

59:38.500 --> 59:40.740
Are you able to tune in?

59:40.740 --> 59:42.760
At least we're recording this one early

59:42.760 --> 59:44.460
so we can have it fixed by Tuesday.

59:45.900 --> 59:47.580
Oh my gosh.

59:47.580 --> 59:48.660
Wow.

59:48.660 --> 59:51.740
Well, I guess we're going to have a meeting discussing

59:51.740 --> 59:56.480
if we should continue to use Fedora in production.

59:56.480 --> 59:57.320
Wow.

59:57.320 --> 59:58.140
All right.

59:58.140 --> 59:59.300
Well, there's that.

59:59.300 --> 01:00:02.200
I guess we continue on.

01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:05.140
I can't believe we just killed our server.

01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:06.660
Should have used Silverblue.

01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:07.500
Yeah.

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:08.320
Yeah, that's right.

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:09.160
You know what?

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:11.340
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:15.140
Well, on that note, we do have some pics.

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:18.920
We'll get to those in the post-show.

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:20.180
We'll do the pics in the post-show.

01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:21.380
Post-show pics.

01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:24.020
On that note, I think that's our Fedora 30 review

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:24.920
right there.

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:26.400
Best review ever.

01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:29.440
And stick around in the post-show,

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:31.020
coming up in just a few minutes.

01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:34.380
We've got some really good pics because it is episode 300.

01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:36.460
And while we are breaking servers,

01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:38.320
we have got some birthday pics for you

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:39.640
coming up in the post-show.

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:41.340
But join us, not next week,

01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:42.820
but the week after for a live show.

01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:45.720
We'll be back from Red Hat Summit at jblive.tv.

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:47.500
Go to linuxunplug.com for links,

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:50.420
subscribe links, contact information, and more.

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:53.420
We'll see you back here next Tuesday.

01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:24.260
Well, that didn't go as we planned, did it?

01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:25.260
Not quite.

01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:27.260
All right, well, Wes has got a job to do.

01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:28.260
It's doing more now.

01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:29.260
Is it?

01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:30.260
It's continuing on.

01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:31.260
Yeah, there's a lot.

01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:32.260
There's a lot.

01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:33.260
Perhaps it'll continue on.

01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:34.260
You just need to calm yourself, Chris.

01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:35.260
It'll calm.

01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:36.260
I have faith.

01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:37.260
Okay, all right.

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:40.260
Well, in the meantime, how about a couple of extra bonus pics?

01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:41.260
Some really good ones this week.

01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:42.260
Bonus.

01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:43.260
Post-show bonus pics.

01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:44.260
I'm going to say it's called Buku.

01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:45.260
What do you think?

01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:46.260
Yeah, Buku.

01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:47.260
Buku.

01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:48.260
Buku.

01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:49.260
Buku.

01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:50.260
Buku.

01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:51.260
Buku.

01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:52.260
Buku.

01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:53.260
Buku.

01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:54.260
Buku.

01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:55.260
Buku.

01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:56.260
Buku.

01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:57.260
Buku.

01:01:57.260 --> 01:02:00.160
Buku, B-U-K-U is a freaking powerful command line bookmark manager.

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:02.580
It uses Python 3 and SQLite.

01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:03.780
I like both those things.

01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:06.780
I know, and it looks really good.

01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:13.220
It also has Buku server, which exposes a browsable frontend for a local web server.

01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:18.420
It can auto-import bookmarks, BukuMarks, as it were, from your browser.

01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:20.380
or you can go out and fetch the title and the description

01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:22.900
from a bookmarked URL from the web.

01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:26.040
You can get started right away and it looks badass.

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:27.340
It is what I would say

01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:29.500
a well-designed command line application.

01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:30.340
Oh, hey, I'm in.

01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:31.160
It's up.

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:32.000
No way.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.600
I don't think I don't think everything started yet.

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:37.060
So like the upload page.

01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:38.340
Yeah.

01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:39.500
No upload page yet.

01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:40.420
No upload page yet.

01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:41.260
Okay. All right.

01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:43.380
So the host operating systems up at the containers.

01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:46.260
But we've got Fedora 30 cloud edition installed.

01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:47.100
All right.

01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:49.300
Let's see if in the next, before I'm done with the picks,

01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:51.260
let's see if Wes can get the containers running.

01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:54.080
Our next pick, Drew and I really liked this one.

01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:54.920
Wes found it.

01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:57.100
Sysctl Explorer.

01:02:57.100 --> 01:03:00.420
So Sysctl are different means of configuring certain aspects

01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:02.580
of the kernel at runtime.

01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:05.620
You know, you can adjust things like in the proxies directory

01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:09.860
and a lot of times you just don't even know what's available.

01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:12.500
So that's where Sysctl Explorer comes in.

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:15.980
It is a great tool to look up the different things

01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:18.100
that you can adjust in real time.

01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:20.920
It's a web page to facilitate access

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:22.860
to the different documentation.

01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:24.220
It's a work in progress

01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:27.120
and it's sort of an MVP state right now,

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:32.120
but you can find it at sysctl-explorer.net.

01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:35.160
Or of course we'll have a link in the show nizzles,

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:37.400
which are probably in your podcast player of choice.

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:38.660
I would imagine.

01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:40.340
All right, Wes, one more pick to go.

01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:41.180
How are you feeling?

01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:42.000
Yeah, I think we're up.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:42.840
No way.

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:45.860
Joe, Joe, can you get the page up?

01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:48.300
I can confirm I can see the upload page.

01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:51.020
Yeah, good job, Wes.

01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:52.160
Damn, brah.

01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:55.460
You got it, man, you got it.

01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:58.020
So we have a successful Fedora 30 upgrade.

01:03:58.020 --> 01:03:58.900
That's good.

01:03:58.900 --> 01:03:59.940
That was a lot of fun to build the tension.

01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:03.680
Okay, and FM stream should be coming online too.

01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:05.180
Welcome back, radio audience.

01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:06.020
Let's see if that happens.

01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:08.620
Now coming to you from a Fedora 30 installation.

01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:11.340
Nicely done, nicely done.

01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:16.180
And our last pick is another command line application

01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:18.500
that takes a graphical classic

01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:20.440
and brings it to the terminal.

01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:24.580
Termshark, a terminal user interface

01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:27.180
for Tshark inspired by Wireshark.

01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:29.580
So this is a beautiful, and I mean it,

01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:34.140
beautiful terminal application to do a brilliant job

01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:35.260
of monitoring your traffic.

01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:37.860
Yes, of course there's TCP dump friends,

01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:40.980
but who wants that when you can have a nice end curses

01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:45.420
full Wireshark-like interface in your damn terminal.

01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:46.320
That's Termshark.

01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:47.420
It seems pretty handy.

01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:50.420
I've only tried it like a little tiny bit, but.

01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:51.580
Gosh, it's nice, dude.

01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:53.300
Sometimes loading up the whole Wireshark thing

01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:54.260
is like a lot.

01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:55.660
Drew, did you see this?

01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:58.660
Yeah, just looking at the GitHub page, I love this.

01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:00.220
Because there have been so many times

01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:02.140
where I've deployed like a Raspberry Pi

01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:05.020
or something on a site and run a capture,

01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:07.520
and then I've gotta go retrieve that capture,

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:09.020
download it locally, open it in Wireshark.

01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:11.140
And parse it, and view it, and filter it.

01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:15.140
But if I could go in and look directly on a terminal,

01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:18.900
just SSH in, how cool is that?

01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:20.260
Super cool, it's so great.

01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:21.580
Termshark, and we'll have a link for that

01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:23.420
in the show notes as well.

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:26.220
So Wes, are you giving it the old Wes Payne

01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:27.700
once over right now?

01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:29.220
Indeed, inspecting things.

01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:30.820
And how's it looking so far?

01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:32.460
How's it looking over there?

01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:33.300
Are we?

01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:40.060
So far, I think everything's up and running.

01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:44.980
I gotta say, I am very, very impressed.

01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:45.940
That deserves an eagle.

01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:51.060
Fedora30, you once again have impressed?

01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:53.340
Except those people that didn't hang around to the post show

01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:54.020
don't know that.

01:05:54.020 --> 01:06:05.380
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
