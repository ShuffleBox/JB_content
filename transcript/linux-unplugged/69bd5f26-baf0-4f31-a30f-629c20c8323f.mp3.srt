00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,040
So today's a special day you guys may have saw the link in the subreddit but

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,800
if you look at the numbers now in the Steam store there are 1700 Linux games

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:20,680
Wowee that's a series of games or does that include movies and DLC it includes

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:26,920
anything that when you search by the Linux or Steam OS plus Linux tag so

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,240
whatever they classify anything which includes oh look at this though hey hold

6
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,120
on hold on hold on stop there stop there they've filtered it just based on games

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,760
they're filtering just based on games so it is 1700 games that is pretty

8
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,800
impressive considering it's not been that long and the Steam machines are not

9
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,680
that established two years ago what was that that's gone up 700 just since

10
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,520
January yes yeah yeah and you know what else I recalled from our discussion

11
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,400
about the performance of the first generation Steam machines we were

12
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,840
discussing you know their frame rate and we were discussing the benchmarks and

13
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,760
how the Steam machines were a little disappointing and we were kind of bummed

14
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,920
about that and then I realized they still are benchmarking better than

15
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,480
consoles like the like so you know because their competitors right are the

16
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:19,280
other consoles the PlayStation and the Xbox one and the Nintendo and and in

17
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,600
terms of raw performance they can push higher resolution with higher frame

18
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,240
rates than any of those consoles can so as far as consoles go it actually is a

19
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,160
higher performer which when you think about like how the fact they put a

20
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,720
spinning rust drive in there and all that kind of stuff when you realize that

21
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,720
the real competitor is other consoles it kind of makes more sense another thing

22
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:47,520
to consider is it's just been released right what other console or anything in

23
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,000
history has had that many titles upon release that's pretty amazing yeah

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,840
really yeah wow wow really 1700 if you figure only 800 of them are any good

25
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,800
yeah right that's still a crap ratio yeah but not just that the big issue

26
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:08,800
that consoles have is that you can't take your console game to your PC right

27
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,640
yeah and well actually I think the bigger issue with consoles is next

28
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,480
generation bye-bye all your money that you spent on all those games where some

29
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,080
steam machine more likely than not your games are gonna be portable to your new

30
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,080
hardware fair point I do want to point out though you're talking about 1700

31
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,640
titles the NES I believe only had about seven hundred and eighty something

32
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,560
titles you know yes and yes actually had 385 right right I mean it is a huge yeah

33
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,880
it is it is a huge amount of titles really well what are you laughing at

34
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,240
what are you just just playing over here with with a with a little thing we'll be

35
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,800
reviewing later in the show yeah nice tease there Wes isn't that funny looking

36
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,560
there it really is yeah you guys will see what Wes is talking about I have your

37
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,680
screen capture setup too so we can show it to the video version yeah I just

38
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,280
thought see it you can already see it it's too late they've seen everything so

39
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,560
yeah I thought that was interesting 1700 titles congratulations something else

40
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,160
that came up this week I never even really thought about it but you guys may

41
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:15,760
or may not recall that I have been using spider oak on one of my machines so all

42
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,200
of my sync thing and my bit torrent sync and my Dropbox on one computer in my in

43
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,560
my office I have them all installed and on that computer I also have spider oak

44
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,640
installed and it backups all it backs up all of those peer-to-peer or non cloud

45
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,640
like storage based sync services to spider oak and so I'm and I'm like my

46
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,040
photos go to spider oak so spider oaks like one more off-site it's my final

47
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,760
destination that yeah sure there might be a few several copies here and there

48
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:46,040
but spider oaks like the master backup well today they ran a blog post post

49
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:52,240
yeah we ditched Google they say we gave it some thought and we realized we were

50
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,480
hypocrites since inception spider oak has been an advocate for online privacy

51
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,660
unlike others in our market we strive to be very clear about how our product

52
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:04,040
design truly delivers zero knowledge privacy for our users so for the past

53
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,440
five years we have been using Google Analytics for monitoring our web traffic

54
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,680
innocent enough decision right then we asked ourselves are we contributing to

55
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,280
mass surveillance of the web by using a feature-rich yet free service that

56
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:22,720
tracks web visitors sadly we didn't like the answer to that question yes by using

57
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:30,520
Google Analytics we are furthering the erosion of privacy on the web wow wow I

58
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,320
you know Google Analytics really I guess I guess it is a really great tracking

59
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,680
system for Google isn't it I mean let's them it's a little you know a little

60
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,320
insight into every little website that uses it man now I have to think about

61
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,480
this I got a wimpy what do you use for a buntum at a on the website are using any

62
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:55,200
kind of analytics package I am are you using Google I am I did I did I did look

63
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:02,720
into using P wick but the simple fact is I haven't had the time to actually you

64
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,360
know sit down and set it up right the other nice thing about it is that there

65
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,440
you know it's fairly quick and they're using real-time features so it's getting

66
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:16,280
more and more competitive too so how do you also it's great it's more than what

67
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,440
Google Analytics does and and recently I was reading about it I've got the tabs

68
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:26,120
open now I was reading about it as a means of effectively tracking podcast

69
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,640
downloads I looked into that as well yeah and it seems to be very good at

70
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:36,880
that mm-hmm so that's that's potentially we use it it's like nifty features JB in

71
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,040
the past I don't anymore but for a period of time and I used a really nice

72
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,000
wordpress press plug-in that just did this for me and it would append the

73
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,840
tracking code information I needed to be able to track downloads through analytics

74
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,720
and I would use that to verify the pod track numbers and what I discovered is

75
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,760
that the pod track numbers are crazy conservative pod track is what was sort

76
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,600
of the sort of the industry standard that advertisers respect and now I am

77
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,880
understand it's because they screw you on and downloads massively you know like

78
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,240
it's really interesting yeah like if it is it is they'll take out entire SWAT

79
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,720
like Wi-Fi downloads they'll take those out you know things whoa all kinds of

80
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,640
stuff yeah so it is really users yeah they're the worst they don't not all not

81
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,120
all Wi-Fi users but like public Wi-Fi and things like that they just cut it all

82
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,720
out anyways so analytics was a really nice third party way to sort of see the

83
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,760
gap there but I don't know you know I over the last couple of years have

84
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,600
started to think more and more about the long-term ramifications of Google

85
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,040
collecting this information not just oh they know where I've been this year but

86
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,040
what does it mean when they know after ten years of my web browsing history or

87
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,320
five years and am I contributing that to my audience am I you know am I am I

88
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,480
subjecting my audience to that so I've been thinking about it more and more so

89
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,000
to see spider oak come out with this post I don't know I also have not found

90
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,560
an open source solution that is compelling to me right it would be

91
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,600
interesting if there's wasn't so niche you know like they say here like like

92
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,040
lots of other companies with high traffic websites we are technology

93
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,280
company one with a deep team of software developer expertise so like they you know

94
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,880
they have people on payroll they can just spin this up it'd be interesting to

95
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,400
see that open source yeah you know more competitive and for me it's nice because

96
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,000
I can see okay what topics maybe we're a little more popular what topics do

97
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,480
people share a little bit more the other thing I have used analytics for is when

98
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,800
looking at 2016 and going okay well where should I take the rover and what

99
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,480
areas are likely to have you know enough people to meet up kind of get an insight

100
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,840
into where your base analytics gives me that so I just wanted to put the put it

101
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,720
out there to the audience if you know of a better replacement Linux action show

102
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,480
dot reddit.com I would consider you know I very much would consider replacing

103
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,520
Google Analytics if it was something that was fast maybe something I could

104
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,680
host on a droplet or or somewhere that would give really good response times

105
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,520
because I don't want it to cause my website to slow down and P wick is

106
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,760
really the only really those game in town yeah and you found it's good it's

107
00:07:54,760 --> 00:08:00,000
good but I've not I've not set it up in anger I've only I've only played with

108
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,040
the demos but you know from what I've looked at it's the only option. This is

109
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:11,840
Linux Unplugged episode 122 for December 8th 2015

110
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,680
Welcome to Linux Unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's already feeling

111
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,240
a little bit of that holiday cheer aka booze my name is Chris my name is Wes

112
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:34,080
hey Wes guess what we got a pretty big show today we sure do

113
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,600
episode 122 of the Linux Unplugged show is here to put it in your face that's

114
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,160
right coming up we're gonna talk about Mozilla Thunderbird all of that

115
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,840
shenanigans what's going on with Thunderbird what does our virtual lug

116
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:51,200
think about it and then today today like salt in the wound Mozilla has a big

117
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,160
announcement and I'm gonna ask just what the hell's going on with Mozilla

118
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,280
and I want to see what people in our virtual lug think I want to see what you

119
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:02,480
think it is really something Wes we're gonna do a big expanded double segment

120
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,500
conversation on the state of Firefox Mozilla and Thunderbird it's a massive

121
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,520
massive project with major importance for the Linux desktop so we're gonna

122
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:15,220
dedicate a lot of time to it today then later on in the show new release today

123
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,120
crossover version 15 just came out now this is the application that made it

124
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,480
possible for me to switch to Linux years ago years and years and years ago and

125
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,720
they have their 15th version today I installed it on Wes's computer I'm gonna

126
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,840
give him a first hands-on boom dropping it why am I excited see what your

127
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,960
impressions are so we'll do that we'll go through and also I'll do the

128
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,320
installation live right here on my machine because I think it's actually

129
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:45,360
it's it's it's all kind of like no other version of any kind of Linux desktop app

130
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,520
it is really a unique installation process maybe a little more familiar to

131
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,240
Windows users I want to just show it to you guys to document kind of a slick

132
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,040
thing that they've developed for getting software installed on Linux and then you

133
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,400
can see what you can do with it so coming up later in the show we'll be

134
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,720
talking about all of that stuff and it is actually really cool what it can do

135
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,800
play on Linux is a thing I you know wine obviously you could run wine on the

136
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,240
command line but there is something that crossover brings to the table and we

137
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,600
also have a discount so you can save some money on it coming up later in the

138
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,400
show so we got a lot to talk about plus a bunch of other things some feedback

139
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,520
and follow-up so let's bring in that mumble room time appropriate greetings

140
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:26,360
mumble room hello hey everybody hey everybody welcome here it is you know I

141
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,400
feel like it is maybe gonna be one of those shows where we get cut off in the

142
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,840
middle because it is extremely windy and rainy here today it is it has been very

143
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:39,240
stormy and last time that happened we literally lost power in the last few

144
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,560
seconds of the show remember that it was like a lot of fun just stay tuned

145
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:48,040
everyone if we disappear we will do everything we can to go right right so

146
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,360
we have a couple of things I wanted to just follow up on before we get into

147
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,400
the main show because there is a topic that every now and then I feel like this

148
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,360
show is perfect to discuss because we've got you and I who are both big podcast

149
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,240
listeners and we've got our virtual log and a lot of them they got opinions man

150
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:10,200
and they are big podcast as well and so there was a question that was submitted

151
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,600
to the subreddit and I wanted to kind of kick it around it's not extremely Linux

152
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,880
related although I would be curious to hear people's Linux solution but it came

153
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,640
in from I'm gonna say Vinci but henchies how you say it he says I'm looking for

154
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,360
solutions to sync podcast between Android and my Linux desktop he says I

155
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,800
guess the title kind of explains it all but I'm curious as to what others

156
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,500
elegant or maybe not so elegant solutions to sync podcast between their

157
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,800
Android and Linux desktop my goal is to be able to listen to a podcast on my

158
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,200
drive to work and then sit down at work and continue where I left off and vice

159
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:49,000
versa now Wes do you have any solutions for this I'll go to you first I know

160
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,840
somebody the mumber must they must you know not in my own life I'm just only

161
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,920
listen in the car no you know I do listen I do listen kind of both places I

162
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,400
usually end up using something on the back end to sync sync thing what have you

163
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,080
to get the file and then do you just jump ahead I just jump you know it's not

164
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:10,240
usually not too many things at once that is enough to be like oh 42 53 all right

165
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,180
that's fine but I do wonder if something like Plex or MB I know MB will do

166
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:18,400
interesting and that's kind of already already has the multiple device you know

167
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:24,760
I'll tell you so my use case is I I drive a lot now it's ridiculous you

168
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,080
don't say and so I but but then like I really get into the show and I want to

169
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,600
finish it up as I get to the studio or as I get to the rover yeah and so things

170
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,720
setting up yeah and so I have or you know the other thing which has been

171
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,040
really nice is Hadid and I have been sharing some pockets like 99% invisible

172
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:45,400
invisibility and cereal which are great shows but like we only listen them while

173
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,680
we're in the vehicle together and sometimes we're in her vehicle sometimes

174
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,720
we're in my vehicle so it's really nice to bring the sync state between us and

175
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:59,040
and I love this as a podcaster because like the idea that we are like we're

176
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,400
almost saving up podcasts and watching them like you would a Netflix series or

177
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,720
something like that sharing them together so yeah I'm like this I want to

178
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,840
encourage this is great this is really exciting as a content creator that this

179
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,840
is happening so I wanted to find a system that would work kind of in all of

180
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,600
these different scenarios and wimpy I'm gonna go to you first because I know

181
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,960
you're a big podcast listener and a podcaster what are you doing right now

182
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,440
to kind of solve this problem because this must be something you face well

183
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,600
just recently I've been using pocket casts on Android for a long long time

184
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,920
and just recently I've discovered that they've now got a web player that stays

185
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:36,600
in sync with what you've been listening to on your mobile device so you can stop

186
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,720
listening on your mobile device go to your Linux computer login to the web

187
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,600
service which you have to pay another fee for so you pay once for the Android

188
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,480
client right and once for the web player but then you can switch between them

189
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,240
seamlessly and it keeps all of your podcast playback in sync plus you're

190
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,680
given you're given a great you're given a great podcast application a little bit

191
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:06,520
of money which I I don't think there is a better podcast playing platform out

192
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,640
there yeah especially to have something like this that's not tied with a bigger

193
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,920
corporation right in you know Apple's environment they're gonna have to get

194
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,560
bought up eventually I would imagine but maybe not they've got a decent sized

195
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,600
team they're making decent revenue right now they make a really good app on

196
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:24,940
Android iOS and and I really really appreciate this the the the tablet

197
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:29,200
version is really first rate and really tablets make for great podcast listeners

198
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,360
because not only they have a great battery life but they have usually

199
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,660
better speakers in your phone so you don't need to hook up any additional

200
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,800
speaker so just for going around the house a tablets a great podcast

201
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,840
listening machine and the pocket cast tablet version is great it's great in

202
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:46,080
fact to try that out we've talked about a lot we went in depth on Kota radio on

203
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,120
the design of pocket cast because they took a lot of what's great about

204
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,360
material and then went their own direction with it and it is really a

205
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:00,560
fantastic app so I it's like five bucks or look they even have the Windows store

206
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:06,440
good good we're covered guys that problem solved so it is it is really

207
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,880
quite fantastic and it'll also sync between iOS so like if you have an iPad

208
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,200
and an Android phone nice right and then the web player like wimpy saying this is

209
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:20,200
my go-to solution wimpy just just basically covered mine because it does

210
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:26,080
have sync it has continuous playback it also has server-side feed checking which

211
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,080
is very nice so server-side feed checking means that essentially they

212
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,000
check remotely for you so your phone isn't wasting battery life going out and

213
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,640
checking all these different RSS feeds then you only get the push when you get

214
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,880
the right you get the push when they found something new and I think that is

215
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:44,660
a fantastic way to do it because early on podcast catchers I'm looking at you

216
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:49,080
dog catcher and others on Android we're just battery vampires and so this is a

217
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,160
great way to do it you don't even need to have Android you can have iOS and

218
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,280
just a web player anybody else in the moment room have like a podcast sync

219
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,000
solution because this is a good one but you got to spend some money and it's

220
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,120
closed source and I'm looking for something free and open something that

221
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,600
could sync playback location maybe if possible you know and of course there's

222
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,200
things like subsonic and the thing that replaced subsonic the project that

223
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,360
replaced that but madsonic whatever yeah whatever yeah we talked about it yeah

224
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,800
we did a podcast addict is what is being mentioned alright so pocketcast I think

225
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,960
that's sort of the go-to as long as you're okay with spending a little bit

226
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:28,600
of in fact maybe I can show you guys the do you use do you use about you don't

227
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,560
use a podcast catcher at all I don't know what do you how do you listen to

228
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,520
and do podcasts on your phone do I just use VLC you're you're kidding me make

229
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,080
playlists if it's a long drive you're kidding me no really I'm old-school I

230
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,600
guess I was just about to say another option for something's like if you have

231
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,040
something that streaming player like if you have VLC on your at home and you

232
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,640
have that web interface or a console interface you can pause it and then just

233
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,560
attach to your if you if you have it you know port forwarded or on a digital

234
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,680
ocean droplet perhaps and you can just use do that way to keep things in sync

235
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:02,200
okay so it's play.pocketcast.com for the web version so like say I go here to

236
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,880
Tom's you know you go here to Tom's a daily tech show well I've got some

237
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,200
really crazy subscriptions and can't anyways these are not my current

238
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:14,280
subscriptions but let's say whatever the sex with Emily right have you ever

239
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,320
listened to sex with Emily no I haven't well it's not a good show but let's just

240
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:21,320
say you want to listen to sex with Emily and you were several minutes into it now

241
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,440
I'm not but it would sync up right here in the web I'm gonna hit play just to

242
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,400
get an idea what that looks like. Hey everyone thanks for listening to sex with Emily you know how much I love

243
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,920
sharing the best sex toys and products with you well on today's show I've got

244
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:35,320
not one but two lovey ladies whose entire business is helping people pick

245
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,240
the right toys for them and ways to enhance a relationship they'll be sure.

246
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,320
There you go ways to enhance your relationship Wes. Is the relationship with the toy or is

247
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,840
it with the human? I think it's probably with the human and the toy together but I'm

248
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,800
not sure I you know what that's probably that I'd have to listen to that really

249
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,760
great episode of sex with Emily to check that out but so say you want to listen

250
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,040
to sex with Emily I'm trying to show you here in the web version you have like 10

251
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,560
seconds back 30 seconds skip forward but the other thing that's really cool let's

252
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,440
keep listening to sex with Emily let's let's keep listening we'll go a little

253
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:08,360
bit further in oh it's nation it is today now watch this I love it I can speed up

254
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,120
playback right here in the web browser that is really nice now I can listen to

255
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:17,960
Emily in fast 2x speed. Shipmunk sex what could be better?

256
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:23,960
but you know hey you can customize it it comes with 7 vibration modes according to mashable the izzyvibe plans to launch in june 2016 so it's basically just attachment you just pull on it.

257
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,920
It's not so bad. No that's probably the best way to listen to sex with Emily.

258
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,920
So there you go there's Pocket Cast and uh yes I was playing with that and also

259
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,280
I the other thing I was playing with uh before the show because I thought I'd

260
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:41,240
be a little funny is um I fed in a custom AR RSS so check what

261
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,640
check this out Wes this was my little solution

262
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,680
because I was just playing around with different things on Pocket Cast and

263
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,680
uh I brought in are you familiar with Pinboard? So Pinboard's a great

264
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:54,760
bookmarking service that kind of replaces delicious and others

265
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,600
and Pinboard allows you to bookmark things with tags

266
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,040
and each tag can actually have its own RSS feed

267
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,480
so what I've started doing is I have started

268
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,520
tagging things with Pocket Cast in Pinboard

269
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,120
and then I can pull them in to a Pocket Cast RSS feed

270
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,040
already set up in Pocket Cast so when I jump in the car I can listen to that

271
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,680
I'm just starting to mess with that because my my main podcast catcher of

272
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,240
choice is Overcast which also has a web client

273
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,440
yes I've played with Overcast a little bit before yeah uh but Pocket so one of

274
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,960
the things that's been fun with Pocket Cast is I

275
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,840
so I have my own custom feed and the other thing that's nice about Pocket

276
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,920
Cast is it has a really good discovery that's how I found

277
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,600
uh sex with Emily there which uh of course had to put that in the podcast

278
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,920
see this sounds like a really good way if you wanted to share with someone else

279
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,800
who maybe wasn't up to like making that custom but if you

280
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,280
sort of picked podcast you wanted to share and they could just tune in and

281
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,880
listen that was actually what I was thinking

282
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,280
uh is I'm so uh I have a couple of different cousins

283
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:52,440
that at Thanksgiving were like all right let's talk about podcast

284
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,560
and I'm like all right let's talk about podcast let's do it and so

285
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,040
now I'm just going to be able to give them a feed and I'm going to put in a

286
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,960
bitly I'll just say subscribe to this feed

287
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,000
and I'll just start putting really good shows in there for you I'm going to do

288
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,160
like my own playlist for them using I mean only throwing in a few JB

289
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,800
you know now and again right and of course episodes with sex with Emily

290
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,080
of course yes and I'm going to throw them in there like you know some 99s and

291
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,720
some some other things in there that I just think are really good shows

292
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,440
and put them in there and they'll just have a nice curated feed and it's a

293
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,040
really nice way to send media to your phone in an RSS feed and

294
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,040
because pocketcast does that remote refresh

295
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,000
as soon as you open up pocketcast they're ready to go I gotta say that's

296
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,680
pretty that's pretty killer I mean that's

297
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:33,000
that's making me interested maybe my single mp3 files aren't enough

298
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,360
so uh Kitson you're a podcast listener what are you what's your solution for

299
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:41,000
listening on the go I just use my smartphone old school yeah

300
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,280
and what are you doing like Wes and using VLC on there or what what were you

301
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,160
using an app are you an animal what's going on

302
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,840
pretty much I just use the media player on my phone uh which

303
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:56,360
right now is uh dead beef oh I didn't realize they had a phone

304
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,960
version that dead beef is a thing on the phone like

305
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,400
it is uh you have to pay for the extra codex if you

306
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,760
listen to anything uh too fancy uh like uh

307
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:11,160
SNES rips and whatnot so if you're into like chiptunes

308
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:17,720
but I just use a uh I use a feed reader uh to get the uh podcasts and then I

309
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,520
just uh upload them on my phone and put them

310
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,800
in my playlist and it's interesting how many people do

311
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,600
that that is actually uh huh yeah that is uh G Potter is a great

312
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,760
one for the desktop being mentioned yeah all right any other thoughts in the

313
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:37,560
mumble room before we move on from this topic uh I don't oh okay uh hold on

314
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,320
whoever had the really great voice go first and then uh

315
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:46,280
who was that I think that was me is that hey citizen hey citizen what's going on

316
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:50,440
hey um yeah I was just gonna mention uh I use antenna pod

317
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:56,040
which uh also works uh with G Potter it doesn't sync location but at least

318
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:00,760
you'll have the same podcasts oh good tip thank you that is really

319
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,800
great so it just shares like your subscription

320
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:08,920
list essentially yeah oh that is nice yeah it uses your

321
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,600
G Potter account thank you okay so yeah yeah so G Potter

322
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,160
which is great one if you listen on the desktop now who was right after uh hey

323
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:19,320
citizen there that was me okay go ahead so uh I was

324
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,680
just gonna kind of extrapolate on what Wes was saying the same thing

325
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:28,040
um as other people are saying they have their desktop feeders that they like

326
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,480
so you just take your desktop feeder and you have it download whatever the

327
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:36,040
podcast is have syncing sync it to your phone

328
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:40,520
and then you can have automatic syncing over to your phone from your desktop and

329
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:45,240
have the same files wherever you go and then whatever

330
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,240
media you like to open those files with on your phone you can use that

331
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,360
you know what I would really like to be honest with you and and

332
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:57,400
there are some things that uh I would just like to be able to have and

333
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,520
I think it's so close but I just haven't connected all the dots yet

334
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,800
is I honestly would just love to be able to send the audio

335
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:09,640
from my phone to my desktop and just keep playing everything from the phone

336
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,240
yes and just walk in and be like okay remote audio send to my desktop and

337
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:17,080
because I have for editing purposes here at the studio I have nice

338
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,840
studio monitor quality speakers right and so if I can listen to a podcast on

339
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,480
that I'm going to right and I would love to just be able to

340
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,840
sit down and be like send a pulse audio server and then the audio from my

341
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,960
like kind of like apple airplay only only apple airplay lets you send to

342
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,040
machines you can send like devices we can't send

343
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,000
like a desktop I would like to be able to set or bluetooth audio or something

344
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,400
you know there might that might I know you can do the reverse I'm thinking so

345
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,600
I yeah there must be way to get pulls just to do it that way yeah

346
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,640
uh all right Mr. Blaster I'll let you have the last word on this one

347
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,600
so um I don't know if the first thing that comes to mind is maybe getting

348
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,200
like a google chromecast emulator or something yeah yeah receive

349
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,440
on on the pc but I have looked a little bit for like chromecast type servers but

350
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,840
google has actually been killing the project so I've been

351
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,160
so it's funny you say that because I have specifically like well maybe I

352
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,200
could make my machine pretend like it's a chromecast because well fuck it's

353
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,720
linux yep so I'll just put it on yeah no no no

354
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,000
which is a good topic I mean google I know we talk about google so

355
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,600
positively I wanted to make I wanted to make I wanted to make a whole segment

356
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,480
out of it and google keeps killing these projects and like

357
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,320
with lawsuit all kinds of threats it's it's not good stuff

358
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,600
but uh if you know of a way to do this blaster

359
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,560
so um I don't know of a way to do it with googlecast

360
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:31,160
however uh there is a product called air server

361
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:39,080
which emulates a uh an apple airplay um receiver and that works it is paid

362
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:44,280
it is proprietary and and commercial so you do have to pay for it but so

363
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:48,200
you're saying it would be easier to use my iphone to send audio to the linux

364
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,280
desktop than is my android that's the thing though I

365
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:55,000
think you can use anything I think I think it supports anything we

366
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,400
used it we used it in the office actually um we

367
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,080
installed it on the pc there is a windows version of air server

368
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,440
uh we had a windows pc running in the in the conference room

369
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,200
and then anytime we wanted to uh cast something with our laptops instead of

370
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,240
dragging out the old hdmi cable we just use this air server

371
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,720
but you're saying they have a linux version they do have a linux server

372
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,600
because they say mac pc i don't i don't think they have a linux

373
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,240
version i'd imagine it runs well in crossover

374
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,840
yeah i would give that a shot right yeah exactly that might be something to try

375
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,600
yeah in the same same vein upnp dlna there might be something there like

376
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,480
right there's already like bubble cast i think that's where your best bet would

377
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,080
be under android is to have a playback client that supports dlna

378
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,920
or some other streaming protocol and then find a dlna server

379
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:42,200
or some other streaming server on linux that it could connect to just send it as

380
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,080
a receiver and queue it up yeah that's what i think maybe the best

381
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,960
bet is but i don't i don't have all that put together

382
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,320
is that essentially what you were going to say kitson yes i was actually just

383
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:55,080
going to suggest uh putting a dla uh

384
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,720
server on your phone and just streaming it to your computer or vice versa

385
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,440
i have lc will play dla so i haven't looked too much into it i just did a

386
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,120
quick search on like pulse audio on android and it looks like there is pulse

387
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:13,080
audio on android so you could uh do the

388
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,920
audio stream so when you get home you connect to the audio stream and then

389
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,360
i would you have it i would like to try this i think this is worth playing with

390
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,880
so and i see rikai has got a couple of links in there he's busticating out too

391
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,400
he's the best yeah well rikai's got that google food like you wouldn't believe

392
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,080
uh okay huh so there's a couple different ways to scan so allcast is

393
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,720
what uh rikai is what is this

394
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,800
hey allcast is the new app that plays photos music and videos

395
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,440
all from your phone right to your tv watch this

396
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:50,120
it's like magic you know kitties are complicated what's

397
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:56,840
not he's holding an iphone he sure is complicated is the allcast app

398
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,280
it's so simple i'll play you a video

399
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:05,560
get off my lawn you yeah you with the ears i do love kids

400
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,400
but you know what how simple is that that's as simple as pie

401
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,560
hillbillies with mullets it's as simple as air or blinking

402
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,760
there's no more crowding around your phone it's the ultimate slideshow you

403
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,800
just throw it up on your big beautiful high definition television it's great

404
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,840
all right i'll check it out i'll check it out that is worth checking out so it's

405
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,120
called allcast and you can find it in the play store

406
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,480
there there's got to be something to it here but uh yeah interesting

407
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,480
all right anybody else have any last thoughts on syncing podcasts between your

408
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,600
mobile device and your desktop device before we get out of this segment

409
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,400
and and really i would love to hear what people do

410
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,480
that are listening too because i yes that's you know those these are the

411
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,680
people that are listening on in their commute right now are exactly the people

412
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,400
i'm talking to what are you doing linux action show at

413
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,400
reddit.com go find 122 and let me know because i want to i have one okay yeah

414
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,000
oh give it to me so i used to listen to a lot of podcasts

415
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,160
when i used to commute a lot probably about seven years ago when i

416
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,760
first studied listening to podcasts and back then i used to have it

417
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:09,640
synchronizing between uh you know my phone and um

418
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,920
my desktop and everything and it worked and it has continued to work since then

419
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:17,400
and unfortunately it's on ios they have nailed this and we still

420
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,760
haven't and it's frustrating and depressing

421
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:25,560
but it has worked for a very long time and we still haven't caught up

422
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:29,240
it's very sad and i actually and maybe you know

423
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,000
my perspective is perhaps you could suggest a bit skewed but i feel like

424
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,240
this is an area that is maybe more more relevant than ever on-demand

425
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:42,840
media is becoming the norm even for mainstream media right and to not

426
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:47,960
have a super great solution here is is kind of embarrassing because apple

427
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:52,600
has their crappy podcast client you've got uh of course google google play is

428
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,920
getting to the podcast scene there's going to be a lot of

429
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,520
proprietary solutions here for this or they're already here today

430
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,720
i'm looking at stitcher i'm looking at apple podcast i'm looking at you know

431
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,960
all those things that are already existing

432
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:08,040
and this is one more time on the linux desktop where it's like

433
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,560
you can do it but you have to hobble together your own solution

434
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,680
hobble together and how many times have we heard that phrase oh yeah you can do

435
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:18,440
it just have to hobble it together it is i hate that i hate that it's not a

436
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,280
good it's not a good answer surprising when you know when apple own you know

437
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:26,760
top to bottom the entire stack every platform that they're on they can do

438
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,880
that kind of tight integration across every device

439
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,960
across two different operating systems you know for a long time and keep that

440
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,960
integration working for a long time whereas we're constantly replacing our

441
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,720
stacks and replacing our frameworks and i would

442
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:46,200
argue actually no i have to disagree i have to i have to

443
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,480
disagree uh apple is constantly screwing up their

444
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,160
cloud-based solutions uh their cloud syncing stuff barely works

445
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,560
after all these years in fact for a company that's as rich as

446
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:59,240
they are it's embarrassing how bad their cloud infrastructure is and

447
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,320
they still don't have it working and they are

448
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:05,400
they are always changing even as a sorry one last point it's even as

449
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,360
recently as ios 8 they completely redid the back-end

450
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,840
storage infrastructure for how their cloud system works

451
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,120
i mean they're constantly making changes and and that

452
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:18,040
that may all be true but the only question you're asking about syncing

453
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:23,080
podcasts and that has worked reliably forever right damn it i don't

454
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:27,320
care about any of that other stuff but i'm just pointing out like

455
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:30,520
but they're they're fairly they're fairly a mess here and yet that's

456
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,480
they still manage to make it work i think that's actually my point right

457
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:39,080
which is like a bizarre yeah now wimpy what were you gonna say

458
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,520
uh well poppy was making the point that everyone keeps changing their stacks all

459
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:46,600
the time and i was saying that there's some people that uh are not basking in

460
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,320
the glamour of all the new and shiny but just you know

461
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:53,400
staying with tried and true yeah i i look at this now and i think

462
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,480
this has got to be something that we will figure out and there's

463
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,240
projects out there like uh vocal have you seen vocal i have not vocal

464
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,360
is it's under the umbrella of the elementary project there's things out

465
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,600
there that have been out there for a long time like g potter

466
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,960
and bash potter but none of them none of them

467
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,560
really have solved this problem g potter was ahead of it if you think about it g

468
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,440
potter created the g potter accounts yeah they've been they've been ahead of

469
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,680
this but they still haven't quite sealed the deal yet

470
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:22,200
maybe it's because they don't feature jp content is pretty i will say

471
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:28,360
yeah they have a nice kind of yeah yeah vocal is nice popcorn time-ish interface

472
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,640
yeah they do yeah they and the problem is is are you going to bet

473
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,080
on an elementary os project i don't know i don't know

474
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:38,840
i mean i don't know yeah i mean if you're i'm not saying it won't but i just

475
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,320
don't know about the staying power as yet

476
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:45,320
imagine imagine where you're you know the use case being you want to keep in

477
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,120
sync between you know your commute to work and then

478
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:52,440
when you arrive at work what if it's one device and you're on

479
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:57,000
your way to work with your phone you get to work and plug it in it's

480
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,400
not you're not changing application it's the same app you just unpause it

481
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,040
hold on you mean instead of remote sending audio or

482
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,160
syncing to files between two systems using some sort of third-party

483
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,880
proprietary service i just have one computer that does it all

484
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,000
that i already carry with me in my pocket every day everywhere couldn't be

485
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,680
done couldn't be who could ever dream up

486
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:19,880
something crazy like that uh i still well done papi half an hour

487
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,800
before you mentioned a window touch yeah that was actually not too bad

488
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:28,440
but this did have a point on that of why not to do that or why

489
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,840
to do the multiple setup system and that you have a nicer sound quality from your

490
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:38,120
desktop than you do your phone yeah absolutely yeah do android support

491
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,680
like usb audio devices could i if i already had

492
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:44,680
like a usb dac setup can you do that from a phone no but

493
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,760
you know what i have i don't think that i don't think you well

494
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,200
i don't actually yeah yes be on the go well because then there you go if

495
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,480
you've got a decent one that supports modular you know

496
00:32:53,480 --> 00:33:00,040
devices yeah in fact uh uh noah's dad is trying to record his band using his s6

497
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,760
on ting we should probably feature that i'd like

498
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,600
to hear that uh so uh i think it's it's an interesting

499
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,960
point because there are we should mention physical solutions you

500
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,720
could also get a headphone jack you know you could hook up your your

501
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,760
your uh your speakers with a headphone jack to your phone

502
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,720
and the podcast that way and that would also work

503
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,400
so there are hardware solutions but i'm just curious what other linux users

504
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,960
uh do for this and this is probably a good um platform to ask that question

505
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,760
all right uh let us know your thoughts linuxactionshow.reddit.com or

506
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,200
jupyterbroadcasting.com slash contact speaking of mobile devices let's talk

507
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,880
about ting my secret weapon to actually giving my

508
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,080
small business real connectivity i couldn't actually

509
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:45,400
afford like the uh duopoly carriers uh prices no way

510
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:49,320
no you don't have like 200 a month just to throw away it's too on data you don't

511
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,760
i think 200 i let's so let's you know i actually think for so we have three

512
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:56,840
lines we're using right now on a cellular i think 200 is generous i

513
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,160
think that would actually i think it would be probably

514
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:04,120
boy i bet you couldn't get under 195 uh then you do taxes and i bet you're over

515
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,520
oh yeah that's tax 220 something like that yeah

516
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:10,360
uh you know it's great because my bill through ting like 40 45 bucks

517
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:14,360
wow yeah so go to linux.ting.com to support this show but also get your

518
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:18,520
get a 25 get yourself a 25 discount just off any device or if you've got a

519
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,960
compatible device with ting 25 in service credit because they've got a

520
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,440
gsm and cdma network probably going to work with a device or

521
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,080
you can get one of their sims which are right there on their on their

522
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:33,320
website or where else amazon amazon oh man i saw that that is

523
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,840
amazing that all of these things just go together to make it so easy to switch

524
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,280
someone to take you're like well you know they'll help pay your etf yes

525
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,600
get the sim card in like a day or two you know you have prime already yeah and

526
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,560
your phone already works so just switch there's no excuse and then there's no

527
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,760
contract so you have no early termination fees or anything like that

528
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,720
you just pay for your usage it's six dollars for your line and then your

529
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,720
usage on top of that and because they have the cdma or the gsm networks you

530
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,440
can kind of just plan where do i have better coverage

531
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,040
or you know like this was a legit thing on the road trip

532
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:08,600
where cdma is stronger in some areas and and gsm is stronger in other areas

533
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,200
so basically and my my observations kind of

534
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,560
show this to be true a lot of hills and trees

535
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:22,600
cdma a lot of flats or not a lot of big hills between you and the towers gsm

536
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:26,360
and and if you can do gsm you're going to get like i'm getting 21 megabits

537
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,560
just like you know uh four out of five bars

538
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,600
21 megabits rocking and that's the thing with ting as you know

539
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,720
they don't throttle you you pay for what you use so they have no incentive the

540
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,760
other thing i like about it is they don't get in the way of the updates

541
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,200
they're not you know how so many times the carrier is the blocker for you

542
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:47,560
actually getting the update yeah ting ting has zero incentive to ever

543
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,600
block the update ever they and in fact in most cases the

544
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,480
devices the the android devices you get from the ting store

545
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,840
are just the pure google experience they're not branding them they don't

546
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,400
have a ting store they don't have a ting cast

547
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,600
service they don't have any like a ting home phone service

548
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,800
they don't have that stuff right they want all integrate in one package and

549
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,760
the nice thing is they give you tools to really control this they have an

550
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,160
incredible online dashboard they have companion apps

551
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,840
for ios and android and these dashboards are legit

552
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,960
they actually work they give you full control it lets you set up names

553
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:22,040
and manage it it is a very nice experience and then they back it all

554
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:25,560
with fanatical support you can call it 1855 ting ftw

555
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,680
and human beings actually solve your problem they have incredible online

556
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,440
resources they have an active youtube channel twitter account and reddit

557
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:37,080
subreddit it is very nice it's basically mobile for anybody who's a little bit

558
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:40,280
technically savvy if you if you're a little technical set if you have a

559
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,480
little bit of technical cred and you're just sick of the duopoly

560
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,760
screwing you around and their crappy contracts and basically

561
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:50,200
screwing you for anything they can you could check out ting that's not part

562
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,840
of the ad read that's just my personal advice after

563
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,960
over two years of using ting if you're tired of taking it in the butt

564
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,800
go to ting go to linux.ting.com linux.ting.com

565
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,400
you'll save 25 off your first device they really do it right

566
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,160
and it's not just me that's been saying that uh consumer reports and this is a

567
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,280
really big deal just put out their annual report for

568
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,880
2015 and you weren't kidding they this is an

569
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,720
in-depth report i mean 90,000 cellular customers

570
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:21,880
surveyed 90,000 think about the work to do a survey of 90,000 people

571
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,720
like three people i don't know i'm done exactly dude i don't even

572
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,160
like people that much i'm done no this is really great so it

573
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,600
was like it was the choice of cdma and gsm that pushed them over

574
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,200
and you know their incredible customer service and the great dashboard

575
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:41,000
and the no hassling you uh when i was on the road trip i just i i had to call in

576
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,480
one time for my mi-fi device and i i just i kept expecting her to bail

577
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:51,400
on me like i kept it because like it was a very complicated problem

578
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,800
it was very complex and i just thought it like it got to a certain point i was

579
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,600
like it is okay if she doesn't want to help me anymore i understand she has

580
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,880
done everything she can and she she stuck with

581
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,840
me and she and we i mean it really was a 45

582
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,560
minute call it was it was it was longer than i was expecting

583
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,360
but i was so impressed that she really stuck with it so

584
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,800
you combine that with uh the fact that they have all the tools to manage your

585
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,680
account they have devices that are you own them

586
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:20,440
outright they're not locked down you get them off contract and then with

587
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,960
their with their with the rest of the ting service it really

588
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,760
it's obvious why they would rank so well but it is really cool to actually see

589
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,800
them get the recognition they deserve by consumer

590
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:34,680
reports annual cell phone service report so go to linux.ting.com

591
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:39,240
linux.ting.com and a big thanks to ting for sponsoring linux unplugged show

592
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:45,000
you guys rock all right so uh i think this is something that we

593
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,680
started to cover we we we started the conversation on linux

594
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,880
action show and i want to continue the conversation

595
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,400
here on linux unplugged and that is the conversation around

596
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,520
thunderbird and what the mozilla foundation wants to

597
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,560
do with thunderbird some of the ideas that are being kicked around

598
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,680
and i don't know if you saw this idea wes but there has been an idea suggested

599
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,080
that perhaps the libre office project would

600
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,680
take over stewardship of thunderbird and they list some

601
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:14,920
really nice benefits over on the libre office document foundation.org

602
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:20,200
wiki what are your thoughts on that you know it seems like there are at least

603
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:24,680
some people inside that strongly are against this idea or you know at

604
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,720
least think it's not the right time but it is a little interesting just

605
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:33,480
given how much microsoft has tied in outlook and their kind of email identity

606
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,400
solutions into their platform yeah yeah from the outlook angle it does make a

607
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,000
lot of sense right and and i would say that mozilla as we're

608
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,360
going to talk about has been floundering i don't know if

609
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,320
that's right i'm a big mozilla fan myself but

610
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:51,080
they've made some interesting moves uh we see a lot of their standard user base

611
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,640
kind of has moved moved to chrome or is questioning

612
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,320
staying with firefox they don't they don't seem as strong as they did and i

613
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:01,400
think libre office is an example of a huge success on the wiki they document

614
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,360
several advantages you could possibly even use libre office

615
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,080
as the writer for thunderbird like you can do an outlook

616
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,520
which a lot of my clients actually liked you can enable contact notes to support

617
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:13,560
complex formatting and pictures you can provide a theme for thunderbird to

618
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,200
make it look more familiar to libre office

619
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,320
all of that does have a i mean there's a web element

620
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,200
but that's kind of the worst part of email whereas the kind of like the

621
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:27,240
document the management the like it is note-taking it is record it that's

622
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,040
where it seems a little more libre office now as many of you probably

623
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,040
listening right now already know at this point

624
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,800
the libre office project has said they don't want it

625
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,800
no hard to blame them but don't want it one of the reasons behind the success of

626
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,920
libre office they say is our sharp focus on a single

627
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:46,680
application which side note was going to be my exact

628
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,120
criticism if this wasn't news by the time we went on air i was going to say

629
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,680
that is ridiculous and libre office needs to focus

630
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:56,200
this is exactly what they're saying they need to focus on a single application

631
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,560
just going to say i was going to get on a big old noisy rant about it but

632
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:03,400
they totally preempted that rant which is not going to change anytime soon

633
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,240
preach it they say we are already working on the android and cloud versions of

634
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:11,160
libre office and that is more than enough oh my god preach it in terms of

635
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:15,320
global effort for a community-based project we are tapped out they're saying

636
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,680
thank you oh my god this is this is this is great

637
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:24,280
they say they go on to say so please avoid any speculation based on rumors

638
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:29,960
as they might be intentionally created by our competitors

639
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:35,080
that's quite a statement it really is maybe a competitor put that rumor out

640
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,880
there like microsoft but it is really nice to see them at

641
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,480
least saying like no you know like we we have enough on our

642
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,200
plate we do i think you do already see a lot of

643
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,440
open source projects that are stretched thinly or

644
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:50,600
have a lot of ambitious goals which is great but limited development time and

645
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,920
i don't want libre office to suffer so i want to ask the mumble room and

646
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,200
we're going to get into the state of the mozilla foundation and what they're

647
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,920
focusing on later i want to save that for the

648
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:04,120
conversation i want to break this up but i will i do want to start with you

649
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:07,000
poppy because i know you have been commenting about this online so save

650
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,880
your thoughts on their current focus on what they're choosing to work on now

651
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,120
instead of thunderbird let's talk about that later

652
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:17,400
and and i would like your opinion on who would be a good shepherd to take in

653
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:22,680
this thunderbird project and perhaps would that person or project

654
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:26,840
need to be willing to completely scrap some of the base and start over or

655
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,560
or maybe they would be would they be somebody who just keeps it going i'd

656
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,560
like to hear your thoughts on that i'll start with poppy and then i'll open up

657
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:35,720
the rest of the mumble room i i don't know i have mixed feelings

658
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:40,200
because i i i use thunderbird and i feel that it's it's a great

659
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:44,920
product and it does exactly what you know it needs to do it's great for

660
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:49,480
you know personal cons and mailing lists and having large volumes of emails and

661
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:55,400
you know it does the job right and okay it might not be ready for the

662
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:59,480
next generation of devices it's not mobile ready for example but

663
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:03,160
you know as a desktop mail client it does the job and many people have used

664
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:09,080
it for many years and it seems okay so does this really need a huge amount of

665
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:14,200
work that necessitates being owned by and run by a foundation

666
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:18,680
or a company or some corporation or could this be

667
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:22,760
a community project that you know throw the code on github

668
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:28,040
put a ci system in place to gate all the merges to make sure reliability is high

669
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:31,480
and there's qa yeah and do regular releases it almost

670
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:34,280
sounds why does why do you have to have libre office or

671
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:38,840
apache foundation or colabra or any other company look after here's the

672
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,400
thing it it almost i mean it almost sounds like

673
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,680
you're talking down to thunderbird it sounds like you're kind of

674
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,720
essentially saying well if you don't have any aspirations to move forward

675
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:51,000
into the future why don't we just stick your code up on github

676
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,440
and and and let the luddites that want to continue to use

677
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:57,560
their old desktop paradigm poke at you and keep you good enough

678
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:01,160
while the rest of us go forward and create our new convergent desktop it

679
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,240
almost sounds like that's what you're saying

680
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:07,480
to some degree yeah because other people other people are making

681
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:11,400
mail clients you know there are the geary guys you know we've got

682
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,080
deco in ubuntu and there are there are other email clients around that are

683
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:19,160
being worked on yeah that maybe are because they're starting

684
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:22,680
later they can not have all the craft that

685
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,640
thunderbird has that people like i'm not saying it's bad

686
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,880
craft i'm saying it's good craft right right

687
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:31,880
maybe they maybe you don't need that and and maybe i'm wrong west but to me it

688
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:37,000
seems like uh to do a email is something we have had

689
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,720
now for a very long time and to get the basic

690
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:44,440
fundamentals of a good email client right it isn't it isn't the world's

691
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,360
largest software project anymore well just

692
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:50,440
just given the number of webmail apps that people actually do use on a daily

693
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,920
basis right i think that's a big part of this conversation too is

694
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,200
what exactly audience does thunderbird target yeah

695
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:00,040
yeah i i still feel like thunderbird has relevancy i mean i think noah is a great

696
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:03,880
example of that yeah or myself i like thunderbird too i i do

697
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:07,080
too uh i uh i wonder uh okay kids and i'll go to you and

698
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,880
then if anybody else in the mummer room wants to comment on this uh tag me i'm

699
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,880
curious to hear your thoughts on it and also

700
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,920
at some point i want to get to wimpy on somebody who's you know thinking about

701
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:18,280
the desktop experience and and and what fits that but kids and i'll

702
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,640
start with you go ahead uh what are your thoughts yeah i think the

703
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:26,120
big problem with uh all these uh newer applications such as

704
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:31,160
gary they're they're lovely lovely applications if you have basic email

705
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:35,160
needs but you can't use this in an enterprise uh someone that has like a

706
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,360
journalist or an activist wouldn't be able to use it because it doesn't have

707
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,640
features like encryption it's a security nightmare well the real problem with

708
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:46,120
gary is that yobra has shut down and there's nobody developing gary anymore

709
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:49,960
that's the real problem with gary so close and then yeah gary's dead

710
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:54,520
unfortunately at least it's a zombie right now um

711
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:59,320
and so that is a part of this is i have been burned by evolution and its

712
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:02,760
instability i've used i've literally used evolution

713
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,840
since it was something that was developed for the linux desktop

714
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,880
i mean i cannot i mean there has not there is not

715
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:14,840
there is not i i have i can't i cannot sit here and tell you in any confidence

716
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,760
that evolution is something you can use at scale

717
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:20,520
because i have seriously used it its entire lifespan it has never held up to

718
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:23,960
my inbox ever and i'm not trying to brag i'm just saying i have a lot of email

719
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:27,880
and this thing can't handle it okay so evolution and if you have minimal

720
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:31,800
uh email needs it's actually really great has a good ui and i love

721
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,720
love love that it ties in with the gnome calendar right that is a great feature

722
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:39,720
and so i actually set up evolution today still just to get that functionality

723
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,360
and there are other projects out there like like they're considering taking

724
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:46,120
gary and making it use the evolution back end for elementary os that might be

725
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,840
nice right so there is something there uh i've

726
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:52,840
tried kmail uh i've tried claws i i have tried so many

727
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:56,520
different but i've tried so many different mail clients and thunderbird

728
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,720
is fundamentally what i keep going coming back to lightning is a great

729
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:03,240
plugin enigma is a great plugin and thunderbird

730
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,960
has the ability to be connected to both my personal

731
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:10,840
inbox and my jb inbox and not dump its pants and and it can

732
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:14,040
do search all of these things like nothing

733
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,920
after all of these years has been able to compete with

734
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,640
thunderbird at just some core functionality that i need

735
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,760
and i think thunderbird has so much in that there are kind of like disparate

736
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,720
groups of email users right there's like the person who uses webmail and it's

737
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,800
fine for their personal correspondence and looking at

738
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,440
the new shopping ads or whatever and then you have people that need

739
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:33,480
outlook compatibility for work and thunderbird can work there in a lot

740
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:36,440
of situations you know or or are kind of a power user

741
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,800
and then you have the very power users who are using mutt in a terminal

742
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:43,080
and without thunderbird there there's not a lot in the middle yeah

743
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:46,040
in fact that's sort of i want to ask wimpy about the elephant in the room and

744
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:51,000
that is with gmail and yahoo mail and hotmail and

745
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,040
all these really nice webmail solutions like

746
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:58,040
mail pile you know that we're working on right yeah yeah but there are so many

747
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:01,960
that are closed source there are so many that are locked down that users don't

748
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,160
have access to the source code doesn't that almost make thunderbird

749
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:08,200
even more important wimpy and doesn't that make other open source mail clients

750
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:13,320
even that more relevant i think so i think that having um

751
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:20,120
open free desktop email clients is as important as having open

752
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:23,240
web browsers in particular when you look at something you know

753
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:27,080
as only what two months ago a month ago we were talking about nihilus

754
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:30,600
which is a very pretty looking desktop email client

755
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:34,440
but the way that it works is to abstract the email handling

756
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,640
to yet another back-end server so now your

757
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:44,280
email lives in two right um you know siloed data centers rather

758
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:48,360
rather than on your computer and i just think you know

759
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:52,200
with all that's going on in the world we really need to focus on

760
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,720
an email you know despite its flaws and despite how

761
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:59,080
things are sort of overtaking it is still

762
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:03,400
the main way that commerce communicate you know commercial

763
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,920
communication is conducted yeah can i pause you right there just for

764
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:10,120
a second just because i want to i want to just take a

765
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:14,200
moment to zoom out and appreciate the fact that what email is

766
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:18,120
is sort of like a federated network of social networks because

767
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:21,880
so you have a jupiter broadcasting server and say there's 35 people on that

768
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:25,000
server that i'll communicate but then we can send out to another

769
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,160
server that is completely different but it has a whole other network of users

770
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:33,480
we have agreed upon protocols in which we exchange messages back and forth and

771
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:37,240
though you can even be get ready for this encrypted which is

772
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:41,080
really remarkable and we have systems that automatically

773
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:44,600
scan and detect any spam communications between these

774
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:49,400
federated networks and what we have if you were to look at it from the web 2.0

775
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:53,480
social networking system is like this incredible distributed

776
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:56,360
social network that isn't controlled by any single company

777
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:59,960
and it is literally like nothing that would enter the market today

778
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:03,240
it's what i think it's what we would hope would right like we would love more

779
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,280
federated services like that email you it's a lot of work but you can stand up

780
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:09,240
your own email server and interrupt completely and and here's i know and

781
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:13,800
here's where wimpy's point to me really strikes a nerve is there are

782
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,640
companies like google who have introduced the gmail api the

783
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:21,560
gmail api is the appropriate way for mail clients to interact with your

784
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,960
google inbox not through imap not through pop3 but now through the

785
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,680
gmail api and they've taken the functionality of

786
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:32,200
gmail and they've exposed it as an api and you know what guess what it's better

787
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:36,680
than imap because it's newer it's more modern and it's more secure

788
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:40,840
obviously so there's a lot of advantages to using this new gmail api

789
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:44,440
but if you think about what that really is is that is taking something that is

790
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,640
this free open network and locking it down to an api

791
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:51,560
and so i think your point wimpy is is well taken

792
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:54,920
that these open mail clients are just as important as

793
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:58,680
an open web browser is for an open web and so i'm curious you know as somebody

794
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,160
who's looking at putting together a desktop

795
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:04,360
how does that influence your decision on maybe would you include a mail client

796
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:08,200
what would you want from that and does the state of thunderbird

797
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:11,800
really make an impact there i think it's too

798
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:17,080
early to say what decisions i might take regarding email clients

799
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:21,880
certainly in the short term i i won't be moving away from thunderbird and i shall

800
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:26,200
just have to be a spectator and watching

801
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,640
how things develop there are as you've said

802
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:33,800
there are other open source email clients

803
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:39,560
few can hold a light to thunderbird yeah i agree and so and i think

804
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,920
thunderbird's one of those projects that's important enough

805
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:46,600
that uh it's always there's there's always going to be a solution for

806
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:50,280
thunderbird users it's too important and too many users for

807
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,600
too long have used it it's been here forever i mean

808
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,800
yeah and businesses use it i mean it's it's it's going to be one of those

809
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,440
technologies that you're lucky it's open source i

810
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,520
wonder what red hat uses i mean they're such

811
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:06,680
you know big users of libre office bra what was it they use what they use

812
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:09,960
zimbra oh oh right yes zimbra of course i see

813
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,080
yeah yeah there is zimbra there is zimbra

814
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:16,360
all right well now i want to sort of shift the conversation

815
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:20,760
into let's talk about mozilla and let's talk about why

816
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:24,600
they can't manage a project like thunderbird even though it has

817
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,880
massive relevance and it is extremely important to the open internet

818
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,760
let's talk about what they are choosing to focus on

819
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:35,080
uh their brand new app that just hit the ios app store today

820
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:38,600
that only works with safari so let's talk about that and

821
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,320
let's talk about some of the other options and where we might see things

822
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,960
end up but first i want to talk about linux academy go

823
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:47,800
over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged go check out linux academy

824
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,920
this is a platform to train you about the systems that use linux

825
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:53,960
or the technology that rides on linux or the basics of linux

826
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:56,920
it is really nice and they they understand that you are probably

827
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:00,600
fairly busy so they have a lot of different features that work around your

828
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:04,440
schedule availability planners nuggets hands-on

829
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:09,160
answers by actual instructors things like that that make it possible for

830
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:12,280
even those of us who are very busy even in the holiday season

831
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:15,640
to take advantage of linux academy i think this would be a great gift to

832
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:19,720
yourself linux academy is something that when i

833
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:23,960
first started working in it uh the kind of courses i wanted to learn

834
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,680
from linux academy were some of the basics i was self-taught in linux and i

835
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,960
felt pretty confident but i began to realize as i worked with

836
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:34,600
other administrators as system administrators that

837
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,560
maybe there was a few shortcuts i could learn maybe i could learn to use things

838
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:41,240
a little bit better so i enrolled in a local community college

839
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,720
and i went to local community college to learn these things

840
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:47,000
and i was very very very happy to pick up a few

841
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,200
small things here and there but the time investment just

842
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:54,920
didn't really add up if i had something like linux academy

843
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:58,280
where you have scenario based labs where you'll receive

844
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:02,840
access to these labs over ssh that put you in the middle of task common to

845
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:06,280
everyday environments you work in these advanced lab

846
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:09,240
environments complete these scenarios from beginning to end

847
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:13,400
on live servers through your favorite ssh client and remember instructor help

848
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:16,280
is available the community is full of jupyter broadcasting members

849
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:19,880
and linux academy is constantly adding not only new courseware but features to

850
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:23,320
the entire platform itself like the new html5 player and their new

851
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,640
cdn and the update of the red hat certified

852
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,760
courseware and the stuff in the aws category that is

853
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:34,440
really really nice if you end up wanting to play around with s3

854
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:38,280
check out linux academy one of the other things i think is kind of nice about

855
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,600
linux academies because they're so passionate about

856
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:44,280
this community is they understand some of the things you might face

857
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,960
when you are trying to get out into the workplace or maybe

858
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:51,960
when you are trying to just upgrade your lifestyle a bit

859
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:55,720
it's hard to get that next job they actually have courseware on that

860
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,120
and one of the things that's really inspiring is when you log into your

861
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:00,520
dashboard you can see announcements from people

862
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:06,120
who have had success and it is it is it is very motivational i have to say one

863
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:09,720
of the things that i found about that is two things i love seeing the people

864
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,720
that try and do some of the same things that i am

865
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:15,480
have success doing it because you realize it is actually attainable to you

866
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,280
that is very encouraging but the other thing that i found that

867
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:21,080
works really well for me is the way it breaks it down in hours

868
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:25,000
things that were massive concepts like learning open stack

869
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,640
or python development we were talking about ruby and python on the pre-show

870
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:32,600
these are things that are broken down into hours on linux academy and i know

871
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:36,360
that they really care about this stuff this is what they focus on it's not just

872
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:39,960
a checkbox of a feature it's what they focus on that's such a huge deal i mean

873
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:43,000
even just listening to ads on the radio you hear like

874
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,200
three different services that do you know online learning kind of

875
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:49,640
oh they have all kinds of different services but this is focused on linux

876
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:54,200
yeah and and and and i know because i have spoken to the people that run

877
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,920
linux academy now for a while we've established a relationship

878
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,840
because they've been advertisers for a while now

879
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:02,440
and i i know what they tell me about stuff they're working on

880
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:05,720
and i know the back end tech they're using to develop that and it's all

881
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:08,680
linux it's all open source it's like they start there

882
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:11,480
and then they work with their educators and the developers to build it out the

883
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:14,840
platform it is it is seriously inspiring from one

884
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:18,360
content creator to watch them work on because because for them it's not

885
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:22,280
just the content that they're creating it's not just the courses they are also

886
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:26,040
building the back end infrastructure to manage it and deploy it all at the same

887
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,920
time not just like spin up a server and you have their

888
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,880
seven plus distros you get to choose from you choose that distribution

889
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:35,320
the vm automatically adjust to that distro and all the courseware adjust to

890
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:38,040
that distro that's a neat feature like to roll out as

891
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:41,240
an end user thing but think about the infrastructure they had to create and

892
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:46,040
develop to make that possible and and like when you're doing aws stuff

893
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:51,400
they manage like local uh virtual servers versus aws instances like

894
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,600
on all behind the scenes automatically for you

895
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:58,600
they really figured this stuff out because this is what they live

896
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,720
and breathe that's that's the human angle that really gets me like

897
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:04,600
can't i feel like many people in our audience you can imagine like oh i love

898
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:07,720
linux i'd love to teach people how to use linux for a job spread the

899
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:10,680
word guys have done it yeah and it's awesome and you should check

900
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:14,040
it out that is why i picked them as an advertiser so you go to linux academy

907
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:41,160
okay so uh today a couple of big things were announced uh

908
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:45,080
number one it was announced that mozilla will stop developing

909
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:49,720
firefox os smartphones they're done they're getting out of that market i

910
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:52,600
mean we don't have to talk about it anymore well i don't know about that

911
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:56,360
farewell firefox os smartphones mozilla today announced an end to the smartphone

912
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:59,000
os experiment and said it will stop developing and

913
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,600
selling firefox os smartphones it will continue the experiment on how

914
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,080
it might work on other connected devices and the internet of things

915
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:09,160
networks like tvs little things etc maybe i

916
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,400
hope so actually the announcement was made earlier

917
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:14,760
today at mozilla's developer event in orlando

918
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:18,680
and uh a lot of people you got to say mo's lando mo's right there

919
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:22,520
mo's lando what is that i see the reason why i didn't is because people

920
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:25,640
think i mispronounce stuff so often now that i avoid stuff like that there's no

921
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:29,880
other way i have mo's lando thank you thank you so uh that is a huge

922
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:34,280
bombshell and also uh poppy uh noticed uh via twitter and

923
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,720
also on google plus uh i like how poppy actually summarized

924
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:41,320
this he said goodbye popular desktop email client thunderbird

925
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:46,200
and hello ios ad blocker that only works with safari

926
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:49,560
so today they announced they're dropping the smartphone initiative

927
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:56,280
they also launched a ad blocker for the iphone that only works with safari and

928
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,480
they're spinning off thunderbird poppy you have the tweet so i'm

929
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,720
going to go to you first but i open this up to the whole number room but i'll go

930
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:07,240
to you first poppy uh has mozilla freaking lost it

931
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:10,440
i think they're they're having a bit of pain and

932
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:13,560
trying to rationalize the work that they're doing and i think they were

933
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:15,960
spread a bit too thin across a bunch of projects

934
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:22,920
and i i think it's sad that they're one of the very few

935
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:28,040
free software uh phone platforms is not going to be available in retail

936
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:31,400
stores but the way i understand it is they're going to carry on

937
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:35,320
developing it or it will still be available on github and people can still

938
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:38,920
contribute of course yeah um and you can still flash your own

939
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:41,720
device right i did this evening i updated my firefox

940
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:45,880
flame tonight so you know that i don't think it's it's

941
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:49,960
you know it sounds like a bad monty python sketch it's not dead it's resting

942
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:53,640
yeah it's not completely dead yeah i think it

943
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:57,640
it's just a bit of a shame that it's had to end

944
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:00,840
you know retail wise in this way because that that

945
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:04,360
that really doesn't mean it has much in the way of longevity if there's if

946
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,680
there's no and are you also worried about the

947
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:11,240
narrative that it now adds to for these you know third part these these these

948
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:14,840
uh up and coming smartphone os operating systems or these free

949
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:18,360
operating systems do you think it adds to a negative narrative now

950
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:21,400
so it depends who you read you know if you read

951
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,680
uh some of the comments on reddit they are you know

952
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:29,080
well you know what with uh y'all are having financial problems over the last

953
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,560
couple of months we don't know how that's going to pan out and

954
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:35,560
now this vague dropping of firefox os that puts all the pressure on canonical

955
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:40,040
for a bunch of os or the flip side is well look at those

956
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:43,560
two going down the pan canonicals next you know it depends who

957
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:48,360
you are yeah you can find plenty of arguments either way really and it uh it

958
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:52,280
is um it does sort of add a little more

959
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:55,640
scrutiny now to canonicals efforts because there

960
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:59,400
there's two less big contenders in the game now and

961
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:02,520
and so people are probably going to be watching what canonical does even closer

962
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:05,480
now don't you think well i wouldn't i wouldn't write selfish

963
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:08,360
off yet uh you know i i realize you know they're

964
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:11,240
under some financial pressure there's no other ones

965
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:14,440
but there's been two big contenders removed from the field

966
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:17,880
no but it would be very arrogant i'm not so sure it'd be very arrogant of us to

967
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:20,920
say hey you know we're still here and look at those guys they've gone

968
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:25,480
i i don't think it's that i don't think that's the the narrative that i would

969
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:29,160
i would read into it i think you know both of those projects are having

970
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:32,760
troubles you know we haven't exactly got you know

971
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:37,320
handsets in every market you know you can't buy a handset in the u.s

972
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:41,480
so you know we're not exactly trailblazing ahead of everyone here so

973
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:44,840
you know we wouldn't be arrogant enough to do that so no no i think it's

974
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,760
troubling i didn't mean to imply that i just meant to

975
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:50,920
i meant to suggest that perhaps every move now will even

976
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:54,760
be more watched because there's less contenders now to to comment just that

977
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:58,120
there are perhaps perhaps within within a certain set of

978
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:01,880
interested you know geeks and phone

979
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:05,800
aficionados and free software people yeah sure i wonder that i wonder i think

980
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:08,040
there's plenty of people who've never heard of any of them i wonder if that

981
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:11,480
means pragmatic open source evangelists will now start throwing more support

982
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:14,280
behind uh a bunch of bubble but uh i want to

983
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:18,840
give wizard jet a chance to jump in here yeah we can he says uh that mozilla's

984
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:21,720
been floundering for a while and he thinks this is part of it

985
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:25,080
wizard jump in and kind of expand on that what do you mean

986
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:28,840
yeah so for a while mozilla's been kind of

987
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:31,720
kind of like it's flopping all over the place i guess is the right thing like

988
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:35,240
i've been i i've had a firefox west flame since you

989
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:37,560
know kind of day one ever since it shipped

990
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:41,160
and i've been using it as a daily as my daily driver for

991
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:43,560
quite a while i stopped using it a couple weeks ago because i broke the

992
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:48,280
screen uh no it it's one of those things when

993
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:50,040
you start sitting in the community and you

994
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:53,400
really watch it you see all kinds of people

995
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:57,000
that kind of are saying you know everything that

996
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,360
all the resources that they have are spread so thin like they're trying to

997
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:05,320
attack a mobile operating system and a browser and you know and an email

998
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:08,200
client and they had instant bird which was

999
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,760
another project which is you know a chat client

1000
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:14,120
and then they were also integrating the chat client into you know into

1001
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:17,160
mail now so thunderbird does that too now so like

1002
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:21,800
they have so much resources that are spread over such a huge

1003
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:25,080
area that they're trying to attack and then you

1004
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:28,520
just have all the chaos that's been going on you know like

1005
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:31,800
for example that the whole thing with with ike leaving

1006
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:35,320
um mazilla you know i'm not going to get into you know the whole controversy

1007
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:39,000
behind that but you know like this all came down and

1008
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,160
like it's just been hit after hit after hit

1009
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:44,680
and i don't think they've ever gotten the chance to kind of stand up and say

1010
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:47,480
okay i gotta find my footing now where do i

1011
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:50,600
step next yeah and i think this is them trying

1012
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:54,600
but you know it's here's the thing that i the whole thing so poorly

1013
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:57,480
here's my here's what i take issue with if that is the case if they're

1014
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:00,440
refocusing you know what's the brand let's figure this out

1015
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:05,640
let's double down uh uh and and i don't i don't quite

1016
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:09,640
understand then where this ios ad blocker thing is coming from it's

1017
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:13,160
a little weird they're they're trying they're trying right now

1018
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:16,280
because and they say it again and again like if you if you go to their their

1019
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:19,640
subreddit or firefox they always everyone the whole

1020
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:23,080
narrative now is we're attacking general users we care

1021
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:26,360
about the general users we don't care about power users they'll figure their

1022
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:29,160
own thing out all we want is the regular people and

1023
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:33,800
regular people have ios devices and regular people have android devices

1024
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:37,160
you don't have yeah you know what else though regular people use safari

1025
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:41,320
and chrome exactly how much regular people have to choose their web browser

1026
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:44,520
right like they don't think it was regular people that spread firefox to

1027
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:47,000
begin with exactly not at first anyway now when it

1028
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,200
counted yeah regular i agree with blockers either

1029
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:53,480
no no they watch all the ads that's true i mean we should be thankful for that

1030
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:57,080
that's what let us get away with blocking all the ads but

1031
01:04:57,080 --> 01:05:03,720
that's true well on on ios i think there's a lot of um uh publicity

1032
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:07,480
around the integrated ad blocking on ios now because

1033
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:11,400
people have noticed that there's a significant performance gain to be had

1034
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:14,840
by blocking all of this stuff on a on a on a mobile

1035
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:17,640
device yeah yeah you know people don't notice it so

1036
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:19,960
much on a desktop because your desktop isn't

1037
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:24,040
like so constrained resource-wise but on a mobile device there's a lot of

1038
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:27,480
advantage to blockings not you're not downloading stuff

1039
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:31,400
over your 4g or 3g or gprs connection and not

1040
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:35,160
using those precious cpu cycles to render an animated

1041
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:39,960
video or an advert or something that's bad exactly so

1042
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:43,400
you know this is a compelling product there's there's a there's a market there

1043
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:46,920
the guy who created one of the first ones you know

1044
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:50,280
went gangbusters and you know people were all over it and

1045
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:53,800
paying him you know wanting to throw money at the screen to get an ad block

1046
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:57,000
for ios so there there certainly is a market for it and i think they've been

1047
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:01,240
quite canny in creating a product a positive product

1048
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:04,120
when all the other mozilla news today has been negative

1049
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:08,760
so you think them having a let's let's just give them the benefit of the doubt

1050
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:12,440
and let's say the mozilla or whatever whatever brand they're putting on that

1051
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:17,320
sort of helps it move to the top you think that that maybe will give them

1052
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:20,760
that that's sort of like a way to introduce them to new users as like a

1053
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:24,520
it yeah it feels weird that they'd be making an ios ad blocker but the it's

1054
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:27,880
really more subversive the long-term goal is to introduce them to the mozilla name

1055
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:31,480
and then maybe they'll switch perhaps yeah and the fact that it's called

1056
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:33,880
focus you know the whole it seems like their

1057
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:37,320
whole all hands meeting is about focus is about getting rid of the

1058
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:41,160
the products that they're they don't need to focus on and focusing on things

1059
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:45,240
that are going to potentially keep the company going and keep revenue coming in

1060
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:49,880
and keep their um their mission statement

1061
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:53,880
alive you know the the open web and and keeping things

1062
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:58,360
um you know right for the users how are mozilla going to make money off an ad

1063
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:01,240
blocker when so much of my question you is advert

1064
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:04,920
right generated yeah and and wimpy too aren't they then like

1065
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:09,160
damaging potential future revenue sources that could keep them alive

1066
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:12,920
well you'd have thought so it's a difficult conversation to have with your

1067
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:18,440
ad networks isn't it yeah maybe it's hey we'll block your competitors

1068
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:21,320
well annoying ad networks well this i don't know this is also

1069
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:24,600
a trend at the moment isn't it to have an ad blocker that doesn't

1070
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:27,800
right yep so you would like to have some views

1071
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:31,720
yeah and they come down like boy if that's the case that feels dirty though

1072
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:35,480
that doesn't feel very good it also could very well be that they're just

1073
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:38,920
going to try and to live off of their whole you know we're going to

1074
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:42,040
set your search provider to yahoo and then we're going to get money from yahoo

1075
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:44,440
or whatever they choose which by the way is horrible

1076
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:47,560
that yeah that's the biggest thing running linux mint this week

1077
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:51,000
yes that is the biggest thing is i was trying to use firefox but just the

1078
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:55,320
fact that they defaulted to yeah they were unusable yeah yeah no uh

1079
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:58,520
it's for people who like to mess with computers that was the biggest thing

1080
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:01,640
that i noticed and i completely failed to mention it in my

1081
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:05,400
review on on last because it didn't seem like in

1082
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,880
comparison everything else worth mentioning but

1083
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:12,840
the search results on mint suck so bad because you just you come to expect

1084
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:16,120
as it as somebody if you've been on the internet before and never

1085
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:20,520
searched on google you expect things to look a certain way and work a certain

1086
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:22,840
way and so you got two options on the mint

1087
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:26,520
desktop your first option is to use the built-in search in firefox

1088
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:30,600
which uses that horrible yahoo search which it's so bad it really is bad i

1089
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:33,800
mean i tried it like i kept trying to use it but i was trying to set up

1090
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:37,400
linux containers other technical things yes i think for regular google

1091
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:40,600
you know regular searches i think it's terrible okay probably it's terrible

1092
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:43,720
especially for the technical linux specific

1093
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:47,400
questions like but then but then so then your second option is when when you

1094
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:51,480
launch firefox on the mint their desktop right there it

1095
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:55,080
brings a mint start page up and what uh clam or some of the folks

1096
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:57,640
at the mint project have done has gone ahead and embedded one of those

1097
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:00,920
sponsored google searches yes right there and so you start

1098
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:04,360
searching in that but the thing is that also looks like a

1099
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:07,560
clown show and there are links all over the place

1100
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:12,280
theme yeah it is it so so so what so what i'm trying to tell you is the out

1101
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:17,160
of the box experience on linux mint is your web searches feel and look

1102
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:21,240
horrible and and result like there it is the worst out of the box

1103
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:23,960
web search and experience ever and it's a weird thing to say but it's true

1104
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,440
isn't it wes yep and i think even just going with like

1105
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:30,440
duck to go even would be like way better 50% better at least yeah no

1106
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:34,040
there's bang g and you're it would actually look right so and

1107
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:36,760
something i something i think you have to understand

1108
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:41,000
is it it doesn't look it looks like scam search results

1109
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,520
they all look like ads or they all yeah right it looks like

1110
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:47,880
phony crap and so it all i don't i don't trust

1111
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:50,840
i don't want to like my my instincts are i don't want to click any of that i

1112
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:53,080
don't want to click that i don't know what that is i don't know if that's a

1113
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:55,640
legit research result or if that's a sponsored search result

1114
01:09:55,640 --> 01:10:00,280
and and uh i find myself actually having to go to google.com

1115
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:03,560
and then so here so i'm going to pull it up there so wes has got it there on his

1116
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:05,720
machine and there you can see there's the firefox

1117
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:09,000
page uh so wes go back to the home page there

1118
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,520
and do a search for like linux or something in there i don't know just

1119
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:15,000
search for something just because i want to show people

1120
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,320
like you see how they all look like ad results they all look like ads don't

1121
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:22,920
they they really do it is no good it is no

1122
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:26,840
now okay so go back uh and now search for linux in the firefox

1123
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:29,880
search box go up to the search box there and search for linux

1124
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:34,360
and yeah you see uh oh you switch it to google you already switched it to google

1125
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:37,800
yeah you said here here you go this is what you see yeah there you go and

1126
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:40,760
that's actually not so bad but it's still not that good there's too much

1127
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:44,280
going on there and i gotta say just just the i don't know it really speaks to the

1128
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:47,640
quality of google is and i hate to say it but yeah the

1129
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:49,880
search results that you get are a lot more meaningful

1130
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:53,480
and it's a lot easier to decipher what's meaningful and what's not it is really

1131
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:56,440
like you so you know you sat down and within 20

1132
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:59,240
seconds you had it changed you already fixed it i don't think i i

1133
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:02,280
think you changed it oh maybe rika i changed it rika

1134
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:05,960
thanks rika he's got everything here yeah well you know it works in the

1135
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:09,160
studio rika did it rika knows what drives me crazy uh

1136
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:13,960
so yeah he probably fixed it but uh it is it is not a hard fix but uh

1137
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:17,800
defaults do reign supreme and so it was and it really bad out of the box

1138
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,880
experience that i just neglected to mention

1139
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:23,880
because uh it made me feel it made me feel unsafe

1140
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:27,000
and i think it's one of those things where mint has so many other defaults

1141
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,440
out of the box that do are are better than other competitors

1142
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:34,360
it sucks that this one is worse also it's using

1143
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:38,200
firefox uh anyways

1144
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:41,800
uh just kidding i love firefox uh i found this whole

1145
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:44,920
mozilla conversation to be rather fruitless though i don't really know

1146
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:47,960
i guess i like poppy's take on it that maybe this is their way to try to

1147
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:52,200
introduce mozilla to the masses uh it seems like honestly perhaps giving

1148
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:55,960
up on firefox os and focusing a little more is actually a very

1149
01:11:55,960 --> 01:12:00,280
reasonable thing to do um i had some hopes pinned on the project

1150
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:02,920
so that's why i'm a little disappointed i am as well

1151
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:09,560
but i to be honest with you uh if i am looking at it objectively it makes a lot

1152
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:12,680
of sense if you have limited resources limited funds and limited time and

1153
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:15,480
compared to like canonical they have a lot less experience

1154
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:19,320
packaging and operating system which is different than a web browser it's true

1155
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:23,320
that's a good point i just i just would love now to see where

1156
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:26,760
this new philosophy takes firefox itself and i think

1157
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:29,880
yeah exactly because mozilla has been a good bastion for

1158
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:32,840
the open web like they say you know it's a little cliched but

1159
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:36,120
it's true and i think we do i hope that they succeed because i would like there

1160
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:39,240
to continue to be an organization that represents that that's exactly it that's

1161
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:41,320
exactly it uh kids and i'll let you take it out

1162
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:43,400
because i know you've been wanting to touch a point on the

1163
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:47,160
identity thing so go ahead expand on that yeah i think that uh

1164
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:51,720
mozilla is uh basically you know they're they're a company with a history they've

1165
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:57,160
been around uh for almost 15 years now they have

1166
01:12:57,160 --> 01:13:01,080
uh an identity crisis right now because they're trying to figure out where the

1167
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:03,080
market's going to go next then you're just

1168
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:06,360
unable to do it so they're just sticking their finger in the wind seeing which

1169
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:10,040
way it goes that's why they uh you know want to

1170
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:13,640
abandon uh thunderbird and that's why they've

1171
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:17,560
abandoned uh uh nightingale which is their music

1172
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:22,200
player they've also abandoned uh their standalone chat client

1173
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:25,560
i don't think anybody's doing much development on chatzilla

1174
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:31,960
either uh and the other thing is is firefox is such a huge product there's

1175
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:35,160
all this technical debt that goes along with it

1176
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:38,840
uh like zuul and all of that kind of stuff that they need to

1177
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:42,600
maintain yeah it's a difficult position and

1178
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:45,720
uh thunderbird has inherited a lot of that technical debt

1179
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:49,640
yep and so there are there is a very honest discussion going on right now of

1180
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:53,960
maybe it's time to rebase and that would be basically a reset

1181
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:58,600
qt thunderbird anyone yeah i'd be down for that i would

1182
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,760
actually think that'd be right i think that'd be really good that sounds

1183
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:04,360
wonderful yeah i i'd like to see a no native uh

1184
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:07,880
yeah sure sure oh man of course this how it's gonna go

1185
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:10,280
there'll be a thunderbird core right and then there'll be a

1186
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:13,960
thunderbird qt and a thunderbird gtk and a thunderbird etc

1187
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:16,840
thunderbird there'll be a thunderbird web of course and then we'll still

1188
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:20,520
complain about the dependencies it pulls in when you try to install it

1189
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:23,480
and it's going to run the thunderbird backend is going to run on top of node js

1190
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:27,640
you just wait of course you wait it's going to happen

1191
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:31,080
oh man we've called it here we need our own red book yeah we do we do

1192
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:34,280
that's a good that's a good end of 2015 prediction right there i think that could

1193
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:36,280
happen actually hey you know what else could happen you

1194
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:40,280
could have your own cloud server in less than 55 seconds go to digitalocean.com

1195
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:44,520
and use our promo code dio unplugged one of these days we should demo that

1196
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:47,960
we should just spin it up on the air because it is a hundred percent true

1197
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:52,520
how come 55 seconds i don't know we could like and we could like you know

1198
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:54,680
each time we could do like a different kind of server

1199
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:58,920
it is that's a great idea west because it is a really easy way to get going with

1200
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:01,480
your own linux rig up in the cloud that is super fast

1201
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:04,840
their entire infrastructure is linux based ssds for their

1202
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:08,360
for their hard drives 40 gigabit e connections to each hypervisor you can

1203
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:12,200
get started in less than 55 seconds and pricing plan start at only five

1204
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:15,480
dollars a month use our promo code dio unplugged one

1205
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:18,360
word lowercase you get a ten dollar credit try that five

1206
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:21,480
dollar rig out two months for free you get 512 megabytes of ram

1207
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:25,160
20 gigabyte ssd because like i said they're all ssds one cpu

1208
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:29,800
and a terabyte a terabyte of transfer and they've got data center locations in

1209
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:33,320
new york san francisco singapore amsterdam london germany

1210
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:36,520
and choronto that's the funsa data center

1211
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:39,480
i'm just putting that out there they don't say that but i mean come on

1212
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:46,040
yep uh and also it's that interface dat interface is so simple yet you get

1213
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:47,880
everything done you can create your machines

1214
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:51,560
you have an acml5 console to watch your machine from the bios post all the way

1215
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:56,040
up to when the operating system starts i do too very nice very nice no flash

1216
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:59,320
needed nothing like no java of course not you don't need that java runtime

1217
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:02,280
that won't even work in today's modern browsers don't get me started about

1218
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:05,400
mustaches and java i have rants for both the number of load

1219
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:09,640
balancers that have never updated it just drives me wild

1220
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:12,520
also one of the things that's really great about digital oceans is they've

1221
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:15,800
digital oceans digital oceans has got lots of linuxes

1222
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:19,400
in their ocean uh obviously they're going to have your abuntus why not

1223
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:22,840
you got your latest abuntus you got your ltss they also have sent os

1224
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:27,320
ah oh now that's starting to make sense yeah or debian you know you want to go

1225
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:30,360
old school just good old tried and true debian they have that available as well

1226
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:32,360
but one of the things they did that was really cool

1227
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:36,200
is they worked upstream with core os and freebsd to make sure that they're just

1228
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:38,200
boom right in with the channels from those

1229
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:41,160
projects to get updates directly they got the latest fedora up there

1230
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:44,520
because yeah fedora is making progress and especially with dnf upgrade

1231
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:48,200
i've got a fedora 23 digital ocean droplet that i'm continue to upgrade

1232
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:51,320
from release release and just see how it goes yep you can see how that goes

1233
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:53,800
but one of the things that's really nice about their interface is their one

1234
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:57,320
click deployment of applications i tell you what you can get something

1235
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:00,600
deployed that's super fancy in no time you go to digital ocean.com you use the

1236
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:05,160
promo code do unplugged and i tell you what you'll love it in

1237
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:07,400
two months now poppy you just created a droplet

1238
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:12,120
right now yep during the show i was uh while you

1239
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:16,040
while you were talking about ting i noticed there was an advert

1240
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:20,440
or a an article about um a daily show with uh

1241
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:24,120
john stewart had been on it and uh i clicked the link and it didn't work

1242
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:26,200
because i'm in the uk and it says no you can't use that

1243
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:29,080
right so i thought i'll screw you so i spun up a digital ocean droplet

1244
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:32,120
brilliant grabbed youtube dl on my droplet

1245
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:34,840
grabbed the video and then pulled it down to my local machine and i'll watch

1246
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:38,520
it later i tell you what it's handy down done it's rather handy they have they

1247
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:42,280
have data centers in london and they have data centers in san francisco

1248
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:44,520
and new york so depending on your preference

1249
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:48,520
and that api right like so what poppy just did

1250
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:53,640
that could be one shell script it's up ansible installs everything it's done

1251
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:56,680
right i mean it's beautiful it really is pretty slick and you know the great

1252
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:59,240
thing is is because honestly i would never write that code

1253
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:02,440
the code's already up on github there's a lot of good code yeah you pull it down

1254
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:06,200
you run it you're done you're done bob bob is indeed your uncle and you can

1255
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:09,560
say hi and merry christmas to bob so go over to digital ocean dot com

1256
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:13,000
and use the promo code do unplug there's so many things you can use it for just

1257
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,280
like we have and i think uh that do unplug code will

1258
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:19,400
give you a little opportunity to try it and see what you can do you'll be pretty

1259
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:22,680
impressed you'll after your first package upgrade

1260
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:25,480
or update you'll be sold oh it's so fast so it's

1261
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:29,080
awesome it's awesome plus what you spent five dollars oh man

1262
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:33,400
so i want to try something kind of never done before here on the unplugged show

1263
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:36,600
are you ready there wes probably not but let's do it anyway i

1264
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:41,400
want to talk about crossover 15 crossover 15 came out today

1265
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:45,400
and uh it is um their release that includes

1266
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:48,840
wine 1.8 the latest wine 8 which you know brings like

1267
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:52,280
tons and tons and tons and tons of improvements they have experimental

1268
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:56,920
early support for like directx 11 in this 11

1269
01:18:56,920 --> 01:19:00,680
11 that's impressive yeah and also crossover now uses pulse

1270
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:04,440
audio as the back end sound system and they've completely

1271
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:09,160
redone the user interface completely redone the user interface

1272
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:12,760
uh for uh for linux so crossover office if you're if you're not if you're not

1273
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:16,520
familiar with it is a linux desktop application that

1274
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:20,120
takes wine and really repackages it and if you're watching the video version

1275
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:23,160
here i'm installing it right now on my computer and i wanted to go through this

1276
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:27,960
installation with you because it's kind of familiar but not for the

1277
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:31,320
linux desktop and and and this is really this is

1278
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:35,160
really where crossover begins is if you have come from the windows

1279
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:38,760
world to the linux world this immediately feels familiar it's a

1280
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:41,400
setup wizard so chris how did you start this

1281
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:45,400
oh you know the story but the long version is the short version of the long

1282
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:48,440
story is i had to have exchange compatibility in

1283
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:53,400
order to use the linux desktop at work and evolution wasn't doing the job i had

1284
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:56,760
to be able to use outlook and and and i was kind of new to linux

1285
01:19:56,760 --> 01:20:00,440
desktop and what crossover gives you is a really

1286
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:03,880
sort of out of the box simple and back then

1287
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:07,000
everything was installed from cd like so it managed all of that right

1288
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
so it would tell you when to insert new cds

1289
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,600
and out of the box with a wizard i could install office have full outlook

1290
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:15,880
and be ready to go license it like normal yeah oh yeah oh yeah so anyways

1291
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:18,600
i'm going through the installation right now so it installs an opt

1292
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:22,440
cx office which is where all the best stuff goes you know

1293
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:25,640
puts itself aside in the file system that actually is really

1294
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:29,480
kind of handy because you can you can have crossover wine and you can have

1295
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:33,240
regular upstream wine installed like separate bottles and the whole plan and

1296
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:36,200
so that's very nice so now it's installed here on the desktop

1297
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:41,000
and i can hit finish and when i go to my menu there will be a crossover entry

1298
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:45,000
that was that is created and i will launch crossover here

1299
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,120
and you'll immediately notice the uh if it launches oh

1300
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:51,080
so this is actually kind of nice it doesn't do this on all distributions but

1301
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:55,080
on ubuntu based distributions or debian based distros it does do this

1302
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:58,920
and it says there are several uh dependencies that i need

1303
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:02,360
in order to make wine applications work correctly so it immediately launches

1304
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:06,520
the terminal ask me for my pseudo password that's the big part right there

1305
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:09,480
gets it in there and then installs the dependent packages

1306
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:12,360
that are necessary to make sure that you're out of the box experience

1307
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:16,760
actually is pretty nice and so this is something that you wouldn't

1308
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:21,080
starting right here when you're trying to run your own application under wine

1309
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:24,600
you would need to go google well why isn't my wine application running yes

1310
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:27,560
and maybe this is your first time on linux you're trying it out seeing if you

1311
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:29,960
can make it work yeah or or really even if you've been

1312
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:33,640
using it for a while like do you okay just it's so instead of having

1313
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:35,960
to do this i try to launch the application it fails

1314
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:39,160
and then okay i go get this dependency now i need this dependency and

1315
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:43,880
each one is a google search before you even try to do anything this says hey

1316
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:47,560
this environment's never going to work you need to install a few packages

1317
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:50,680
and then it goes out and gets those packages for you automatically so you

1318
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:53,560
never get into that game of trying to figure out what dependencies

1319
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:56,920
need to be installed to run this properly it just manages that for you so

1320
01:21:56,920 --> 01:21:59,080
i i actually think that is worth some value

1321
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:02,840
right there but then once you have once it does that it brings you up to

1322
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:05,560
their brand new interface this this doesn't look anything like

1323
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:08,520
crossover has looked under linux for for a decade now

1324
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:12,360
and you click install software one of the first things that happens

1325
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:16,360
is it says hey for better results i could go out and get a new update of all of

1326
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:18,920
the available applications that will work under crossover

1327
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:21,960
would you like me to do that and i always say yes so i say always update

1328
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:25,080
and it has a ui for telling you it's sort of like going out and getting a new

1329
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:28,200
list of packages and then after it's done i

1330
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:31,480
will have a category of app i will have broken down by categories

1331
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:34,280
different applications i can install so i can just search for something like

1332
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:39,160
quicken i hit search and it will quicken uh basically

1333
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:42,280
every version of quicken is on here although i don't know why the search

1334
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:46,920
isn't working oh there it goes quicken and so you can see even up to

1335
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:50,360
quicken 2016 is on here so if you need to use more quicken than i would ever

1336
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:53,400
want to run i know right but if you if you want to if you need

1337
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:55,880
to if you need to use quicken under linux and uh

1338
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:59,080
this is something the crossover development team

1339
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:02,440
specifically focuses on to make sure this application works even got a star

1340
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:05,000
rating yeah exactly yeah and there's other things in there that don't

1341
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,680
necessarily have such a good star rating

1342
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:10,520
you can also just browse the available applications so uh you can go and you

1343
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:14,840
know go to games and you can go to uh online games and a

1344
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:17,880
good thing here is like this installer doesn't look horribly

1345
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:21,080
unnative right like it it fits right into what your desktop experience

1346
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:23,960
yeah and so say i wanted to play star trek online because uh

1347
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:27,080
well you do well it's star trek and i do actually want to play it

1348
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:30,760
you click it here it gives you the rating and when i say continue one of

1349
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:33,800
the nice things is is there's several installation options for the installer

1350
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:36,440
source it can get the star trek online installer

1351
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:39,480
for steam we also did this with a batman arkham city

1352
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:43,320
earlier before we started the show it can download the installer directly from

1353
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:46,200
their website or if i have the installer locally i can

1354
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:49,320
just point it at that i don't so i'll just say i can choose

1355
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:51,640
download the installer now when i continue

1356
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:55,720
it will create the english version uh it will it will go and get the english

1357
01:23:55,720 --> 01:24:00,680
version of star trek online it will download the file it will create

1358
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:04,360
a windows xp bottle named star trek online and then it will

1359
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:07,480
begin to install the additional dependencies that it needs like directx

1360
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:10,440
internet explorer because the launcher uses internet explorer to render

1361
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:13,480
right so it installs internet explorer it gets the minimum versions of those

1362
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:16,600
that it requires to function and then it locks it all down into a

1363
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:19,320
static bottle that is isolated from all of the other wine

1364
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:22,360
applications i use so their changes will never affect my

1365
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:24,520
ability to play star trek on you randomly

1366
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:31,640
right it'll just work so that is the go ahead uh i've used uh play on linux

1367
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:35,960
quite a bit yeah now i've i've resorted to

1368
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:41,480
saying i will only accept native linux content because i always seem to hit

1369
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:45,960
one issue is we use cdns now we use steam to

1370
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:50,680
get our games and our games that may be windows based but use steam

1371
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:54,280
whenever that updates you hit wine regression

1372
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:59,640
does crossover have a particular way of dealing with this to where your games

1373
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:03,560
and your save files don't just break because that's my main issue with play

1374
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:06,440
on linux i can't really answer that because that is

1375
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:10,040
always a possibility but so the way crossover so we before the

1376
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:14,840
show did batman arkham city and arkham asylum and uh

1377
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:18,840
what what crossover does is it creates a bottle for each game so that's like an

1378
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:21,320
isolated container to use today's parlance

1379
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:27,880
and it actually installs directx in that bottle it installs steam

1380
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:31,800
windows version in that bottle you log into steam

1381
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:36,280
it then downloads batman arkham asylum into that bottle

1382
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:40,360
and here i'm gonna pull your screen up west and it installs steam then steam

1383
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:43,160
goes out and gets the game and it uses the steam game

1384
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:48,280
to actually use it so i uh the answer is it's it installs windows steam it

1385
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:51,400
installs it uses that client so that's kind of

1386
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:54,440
the usage paradigm and then crossover seems to be built for that so there you

1387
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:57,480
go west just lost windows steam here yeah windows steam which is kind of

1388
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:00,360
weird because it looks a lot like linux team it really does which i mean

1389
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:04,440
testament of out there so west why don't you okay so minimize steam there and uh

1390
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:08,760
why don't you launch like uh this is an example uh the excel viewer

1391
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:11,000
there just you can double click on that as an

1392
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:15,640
application and uh it will it will look like the regular

1393
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:19,080
old version of excel viewer and i want to then what we'll do

1394
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:21,480
is and you have to do the trial you have to acknowledge the trial because i

1395
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:25,080
didn't register it on there there you go so look it's got the nice new uh what do

1396
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:28,760
they call that a beautiful what do they call that i forget the ribbon the ribbon

1397
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:32,280
it's got the ribbon that is the excel viewer now west go ahead and close that

1398
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:36,200
uh and get it out of here get it out of here west and click on install windows

1399
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:38,520
software there and let's just walk through that it's

1400
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:42,200
the bottom of the ui there uh and why don't you search for word

1401
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:44,360
viewer in the search box there because this is free

1402
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:47,960
it'll just automatically download it off the web it could install full-fledged

1403
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:50,760
office as well but you would actually have to have

1404
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:55,320
the installation media i see which we do not have here at jb1 studios no of

1405
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:58,520
course not so okay so search for word or or you

1406
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:01,080
can you could probably just put word in there or something like that

1407
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:04,360
and it will come up and and it has it here we go

1408
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:08,040
would you like 2003 or 2007 so this is the nice thing too

1409
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:12,120
it is sometimes you want older versions of windows software for compatibility

1410
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:14,440
testing you're getting from your client etc

1411
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:17,880
and so this bottle environment makes it possible to have different versions of

1412
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:21,160
windows software on your linux box so which one did you choose 2007

1413
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:25,000
yeah because that'll do the the docx so then you say continue

1414
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,280
and what's it say there it's going to go out and get those files english version

1415
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:32,200
you'll download the installer install into a new windows xp bottle named

1416
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:35,800
microsoft word viewer 2007 so even if you're just looking at the bottle you

1417
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:38,840
know what's in there and what's nice so you see how they did windows xp

1418
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:42,760
is what they do for windows software is the lowest common denominator

1419
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:45,160
that way it's not going to try to do something super fancy it's not going to

1420
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:49,240
work under linux all the updates all the patches right and and the software goes

1421
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:51,720
oh i'm on xp i'll just give you this and it's just

1422
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:55,560
honestly functional right it's just basic okay so hit next there whatever it

1423
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:58,600
is install whatever your option is and now it goes out and it's going to go

1424
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:01,480
out and pull out each individual dependency and say trial there because

1425
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:04,840
we're just doing the trial version now this is going to walk you through all

1426
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:07,720
of the software you would need to install before you could run the viewer

1427
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:11,400
chris i have to ask do you accept the license agreement

1428
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:15,560
hold on wes i'm not so sure uh

1429
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:21,880
yes i'll accept all right let's do it live on air you can just hit next you

1430
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:24,600
don't have to put anything in there and just yep next next next all right so

1431
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:26,600
you're going through it's it's bringing you through

1432
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:31,000
each type of dependency package like the redistributed files libraries the real

1433
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,560
experience installing microsoft software

1434
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:36,840
yeah it's a real msi installation you're going to choose your so there you go now

1435
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:40,440
you just now hit ok and now hit ok there and you'll see in

1436
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:43,400
the background crossover will finish things up it'll get any of the last

1437
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:46,600
things that need to be done is downloading these off of microsoft site

1438
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:49,240
right now for you you don't have to go get these files yourself

1439
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:52,440
and now it's done and now it's been added as an icon there

1440
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:57,640
and also wes it adds those lamo yeah and it also go into your menu there you

1441
01:28:57,640 --> 01:29:01,400
can close this go ahead and close this uh and then go into your menu there and

1442
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:04,360
if you look around like i think if you go into crossover anyways or maybe an

1443
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:07,560
office category yeah an office it i think go to your office or did it add

1444
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:11,000
them to your office category you know i don't i'd only see libre

1445
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,640
office right now okay yeah i'm not yeah i'm not sure if it

1446
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:16,440
does with the viewers it will it can integrate them oh here we go windows

1447
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:19,800
application there's a whole separate category oh yeah yeah yeah yeah it can

1448
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:22,840
integrate them in with the desktop menuing system as well

1449
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:25,800
that's really nice it is really nice and so this

1450
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:29,560
especially for you're trying to migrate your friend to linux right you install

1451
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:33,000
this you set it up and they're right in their start menu i

1452
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,880
say with quotation marks quote unquote it looks you know right like they can

1453
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:38,920
just load word if that's what they need for work or whatever yeah

1454
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:45,160
so it is uh it's a pretty nice ui and oh uh if you go go here wes

1455
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:49,960
to uh let's see i think it's a view i'm not sure what the

1456
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:52,920
menu option is there there's a way to view bottles or so

1457
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:56,280
bottles show bottles here we go yeah so there on the left there it has broken

1458
01:29:56,280 --> 01:30:00,760
out each container environment in a so you can have different service

1459
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:04,200
packs dot net installs if you right click on like one of them

1460
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:07,240
you have different options like you can shut down all of the running processes

1461
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:09,880
in that bottle so if you've got like a windows app that's being we can run a

1462
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:12,760
command install software into bottle that's awesome

1463
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:16,280
yeah and you can also launch control panel applets you can manage like

1464
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:19,800
your different control panel settings you can open the c drive right there you

1465
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:21,800
can modify it yourself if you need to which

1466
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:25,000
is something you need to do if you're going to use if you're going to play star

1467
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:28,040
star wars old republic through crossover you need to be able to right click on it

1468
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:30,680
and go edit one of the launcher dot settings

1469
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:34,440
wow files and it's it just makes it really easy to do all of that

1470
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:38,840
so uh anyways it's crossover office version 15 now here's the thing wes

1471
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:43,000
uh and us linux users we're not used to paying very much for software no we're

1472
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:47,080
not it's 60 bucks it's 60 bucks uh

1473
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:51,240
but they do have a promo code going right now i got info in the show notes

1474
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:55,320
and uh you can get it if you use like the promo code what is it here um

1475
01:30:55,320 --> 01:31:00,680
cx 15 you get 50 you get 25 off for their new religion and i will say if

1476
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:04,280
you are a user of wine you know these people contribute yeah

1477
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:06,840
like all this goes back upstream that's the other thing to mention

1478
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:10,040
so and so you are helping uh future development of the wine project and it's

1479
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:12,680
a lot of work can you imagine being a wine developer like

1480
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:16,680
that's a lot of thankless just like oh how do i make this microsoft crap

1481
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:20,040
work on the linux desktop yeah right that's a lot of work so

1482
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:23,000
it's kind of cool that there's a commercial effort to help support that

1483
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:27,160
effort yeah and the 60 bucks is for this version but they usually do

1484
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:31,640
many updates and like when the new versions of ubuntu or fedora or open

1485
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:36,120
suso when major versions come out they generally issue a new update and

1486
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:39,320
your purchase covers those updates for this version nice

1487
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:42,840
so i always buy every major version and then i just get all of the updates for

1488
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:46,520
like a year or whatever it is and i end up installing it on any serious

1489
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:49,880
workstation where i want to be able to run any windows application

1490
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:53,400
because you know i almost prefer to use things with regular straight out

1491
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:57,320
wine because i just drop to the command line wine the executable name i'm good

1492
01:31:57,320 --> 01:32:00,120
to go right yeah but if it's ever more advanced

1493
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:03,480
that there's dependencies or i want to be able to revert or take snapshots or

1494
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:06,760
something that's going to be installed like appliance life long term or

1495
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:09,800
like my game like star trek online i just want it to work

1496
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:13,640
and that's where i use crossover and i i don't know exactly how long i've been

1497
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:16,920
using it but i think i've i think i think since

1498
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:20,280
2003 but i'm not i'm i'm not quite sure it's been a long

1499
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:22,360
long time and i've bought every single version

1500
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:25,640
they've never ever paid me to promote it they've never paid me to talk about it

1501
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:29,240
and i almost don't even know you exist yeah no they don't exist

1502
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:32,360
uh we actually might talk to them on friday

1503
01:32:32,360 --> 01:32:35,480
uh before uh the linux action show they were going to join us today but the

1504
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:37,080
scheduling just didn't work out because their

1505
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:41,480
ceo is on vacation but he may come back on friday and if he is back we'll talk

1506
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:43,480
to him and maybe we get that in the linux

1507
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:47,400
action show so uh anyways yeah go check it out we'll

1508
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:50,040
have links in the show notes it's just a really great piece of commercial

1509
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:52,520
software that's managed to be around for a long

1510
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:56,040
time um and i i like that about it and it's

1511
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:58,840
available it's been available for the linux desktop and it's made switching

1512
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:01,400
possible and if quicken or something like that

1513
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:04,280
is one of those few applications you need to get and that's a big deal for a

1514
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:08,600
lot of small businesses huge huge huge actually it's a huge deal

1515
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:10,680
i've used i've had to use it myself in the past

1516
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:14,200
it's i think it's up there with auto cad and photoshop

1517
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:17,720
definitely i think it's a big deal they make it work oh also photoshop

1518
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:21,720
i think with starting with cs which isn't the latest

1519
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:27,480
but cs and earlier um work beautifully under crossover just give

1520
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:29,560
you all of the stuff you need to get it going

1521
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:33,000
you just point it at the installation file and it sets everything up for you

1522
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,040
integrates photoshopping with your desktop it can you can even associate

1523
01:33:36,040 --> 01:33:40,040
you know file extensions with photoshop it's like having adobe photoshop on your

1524
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:43,560
linux desktop full full full-fledged and if you're okay

1525
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:48,280
with things like version 7 of photoshop which really is

1526
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:52,200
fine really it is flawless under crossover

1527
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:55,720
there is like nothing that doesn't work it's amazing

1528
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:59,560
and and it i mean it is good enough under crossover that i think you could

1529
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:03,160
use it full time as your daily driver and it just that's a

1530
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:06,520
big deal so they take they make quicken and adobe photoshop

1531
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:09,960
very easy for non-experienced users to get going under linux and i just don't

1532
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:12,440
think the project and the company gets enough attention

1533
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:15,320
and the other thing that burns me is they make way more money on their mac

1534
01:34:15,320 --> 01:34:18,280
product which is total shit wow because they've been around for linux

1535
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:21,400
way longer and if linux users would just step up a

1536
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:23,720
little bit and buy something from time to time

1537
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:27,000
uh then we wouldn't yeah we don't pay any license fees so yeah and then they

1538
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,560
release cash in your pocket and then they release something for the mac and that's

1539
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:32,200
what sustains the business after all these it's just it drives me crazy

1540
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:37,560
so we go out there and buy something and uh yes that is true uh it is uh it is a

1541
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:40,760
proprietary which is negative in the freedom

1542
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:43,800
dimension but it is a commercial product that contributes upstream

1543
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:46,840
right i mean i think we see similar things with valve

1544
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:49,960
with netflix right these are all kind of areas that are

1545
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:53,640
open source ish in some ways yeah they're not quite at the end user

1546
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:56,680
perspective but they might help our cause in the long run

1547
01:34:56,680 --> 01:34:59,960
yeah uh all right so i wanted to mention something

1548
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:03,080
so now we're talking about stuff you can pay for let's talk about stuff you get

1549
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:06,760
for free uh we are doing swag for the holidays we

1550
01:35:06,760 --> 01:35:10,040
just gave away a really really cool linux action show

1551
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:13,320
glass coaster which was neat it was a thick piece of

1552
01:35:13,320 --> 01:35:15,480
glass with the linux action show logo in there

1553
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:18,520
uh we gave if we were giving away all kinds of swag

1554
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:22,520
if you have successful patreon payments in november or december for the

1555
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:25,880
patreon.com today or patreon.com on filter

1556
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:30,840
patrons pages patreon pages paid i'm confused patron pages

1557
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:34,760
uh then you just have to watch for swag links in the show notes of any show

1558
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:38,120
sometime in december like kota radio or other shows text

1559
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:41,080
snap shows like that there's swag link wait just

1560
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:43,320
click it there's just a link in there just swag links in there

1561
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:46,520
and then you get entered to draw and if you think about this

1562
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:50,600
the pool is not that big so you have to be a successful patron

1563
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:53,800
so you can just go which means you love jb a whole lot and you're helping us you

1564
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:58,360
keep us going patreon.com today you have to be a successful so that so

1565
01:35:58,360 --> 01:36:01,160
you know the total number of people that is because that number is right on the

1566
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:04,520
patreon page and then there is only a subset of those

1567
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:06,840
people who are going to click the link and enter

1568
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:12,120
to get the swag so i'm just saying is a hatched the chances of actually

1569
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:16,200
winning something are extremely high and uh wes you saw

1570
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:19,240
when you got here it's beautiful this is badass is what this is

1571
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:23,000
full christmas fever yeah so and and legitimately so

1572
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:26,920
each one of those boxes has wrapped swag for each show

1573
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:31,080
whoa each show has its own individual swag that is unique to that show that

1574

tuesday

1609
01:38:52,760 --> 01:39:14,920
oh wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait you said commercial software

1610
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:19,880
all right jbtitles.com now we have to name this beast i just like to say that

1611
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:24,520
crossover has age of empires 3 patch 114 up in here

1612
01:39:24,520 --> 01:39:27,720
now does it have a web installer because that's the real sweet spot when it just

1613
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:30,120
goes and gets the setup off of the web for you

1614
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:35,000
that's the it does aom.zone.com i have no idea do it hit install oh my god

1615
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,400
that's amazing i've been wanting to play that game so

1616
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:39,880
that's what i love is sometimes these scripts like sometimes you have to

1617
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:42,760
supply your own executable but sometimes they just go get the

1618
01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:47,000
executable it's like if if there's an ex if there's an exe on the web somewhere

1619
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:50,200
they will stick it in there in true windows style i love it

1620
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:53,240
so now we're gonna be playing some age of empires here in a little bit we won't

1621
01:39:53,240 --> 01:39:58,280
even have time for future shows no no screw that so um

1622
01:39:58,280 --> 01:40:02,280

1634
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:54,440
actually buy the memory for the haswell um boxes and this will work in this

1635
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:57,240
particular generation so i've got the faster clock

1636
01:40:57,240 --> 01:41:01,560
ram but um and i'm also going to have to eat some humble pie and take everything

1637
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:04,760
bad i said about black friday because this wouldn't have happened had it been

1638
01:41:04,760 --> 01:41:07,640
the black friday deals in the uk this year

1639
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:12,920

1640
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:15,720

01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:22,280
fancy nvme um ssds which is

1642
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:28,440
amazing oh yeah oh yeah read read performance is 2000 megabytes a

1643
01:41:28,440 --> 01:41:32,600
second and write performance oh my gosh oh 500

1644
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:36,680
megabytes per second so if you've ever booted a knuck

1645
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:39,880
and you've seen that intel knuck logo you know the big

1646
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:43,640
nuc appears in the center of the screen and that disappears

1647
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:47,320
i've got a slightly old monitor which i'm also going to sort out maybe in the new

1648
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:50,360
year but in the refresh cycle for the monitor

1649
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:53,480
to fade that out the system has booted and i'm at the

1650
01:41:53,480 --> 01:41:57,960
login screen that is amazing it's like are you running what i

1651
01:41:57,960 --> 01:42:01,720
assume you're running of course yes of course it's the fastest

1652
01:42:01,720 --> 01:42:05,160
booting operating system planet now that's right that's right

1653
01:42:05,160 --> 01:42:08,840
um so yeah that's made um that's made a huge difference it's quite amazing

1654
01:42:08,840 --> 01:42:12,760
actually those those new uh quad channel nvmes are um are

1655
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:15,720
amazing yeah yeah wow it makes me want to build

1656
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:20,680
a new rig yep do you have uh a is

1657
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:25,240
system d on this rig so you can run like system d analyze and tell us like your

1658
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:27,800
boot speed on this that would be very nice

1659
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:30,520
yeah yeah yeah

1660
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:36,600
uh huh give me a minute how do you oh link to post that's what

1661
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:41,400
you do a link to post but you can't you can't open that the uh boot the boot

1662
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:46,440
time was uh 1.15 seconds wow

1663
01:42:46,440 --> 01:42:51,800
that is hmm whoa probably faster than a resume from

1664
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:54,760
suspend would be yeah really yeah who needs power management

1665
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:57,880
anymore this is what i'm saying you know by the time the screen has realized it

1666
01:42:57,880 --> 01:43:02,440
needs to go from black to something else it's it's up and up

1667
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:07,640
and round what were the specs again it's uh i'll tell you what i'll find

1668
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:12,200
the exact model and i will paste the details you know what i'll see

1669
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:15,560
you know what i've i've i've realized that i i

1670
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:19,480
if i build a really nice computer i think it gets me two three years

1671
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:23,240
like if i build a really nice one and if i if i go cheap it's a year

1672
01:43:23,240 --> 01:43:26,920
it actually i think saves me money long term to buy nicer computers it probably

1673
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:29,080
does invest in the nice stuff now and look at

1674
01:43:29,080 --> 01:43:31,080
this this is officially three years old here

1675
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:37,480
right and so as yeah no you disagree well yeah my my the computer that it's

1676
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:43,320
replacing um is was purchased in 2008

1677
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:47,720
and that was a it's um dual quad core xeon

1678
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:52,520
with 32 gigs of ram and nvidia stuff and all the rest of it

1679
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:55,960
and it's got a sas raid and what have you

1680
01:43:55,960 --> 01:44:02,680
and that machine is still very very usable today um and more so because

1681
01:44:02,680 --> 01:44:06,920
because of black friday i've got four 250 gig

1682
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:14,520
