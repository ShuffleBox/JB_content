This is Linux Unplugged Episode 44 for June 10th, 2014.

00:30.000 --> 00:41.520
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's yabba-dabba excited to talk

00:41.520 --> 00:47.000
about Bedrock Linux. My name is Chris. And my name is Matt. Hey Matt, episode 44 and we've got

00:47.000 --> 00:51.480
the founder of Bedrock Linux on the line waiting for us just to get to him. He's been patiently

00:51.480 --> 00:56.960
here all pre-show. We've had a fun pre-show today and I'm excited to kind of uncover Bedrock Linux

00:56.960 --> 01:01.280
a little more. It's a pretty interesting distro that we reviewed on Sunday's Linux action show.

01:01.280 --> 01:06.560
I believe it was episode 316, if you haven't seen that one. It's not required reading but

01:06.560 --> 01:12.680
highly suggested reading if you want to be well-rounded. And then we'll also get to some

01:12.680 --> 01:19.080
feedback and if we've got some time. Matt, something's got me upset all day. Alienware

01:19.080 --> 01:25.760
has slapped Linux users in the face. They've taken a trout that's like two days old and they

01:25.760 --> 01:30.000
just slapped us all in the face with it. And I can't believe it so we're gonna get to that as

01:30.000 --> 01:34.600
well. Plus we've got some Steam updates and a couple of other things. So good show today. I'm

01:34.600 --> 01:40.080
excited about all this stuff. So I figured maybe if we were so inclined we'd start with our feedback

01:40.080 --> 01:44.400
and our first email this week and we'll get to just a couple of emails and then we're gonna get

01:44.400 --> 01:48.200
right to the Bedrock Linux stuff. But I had a couple of things I wanted to start with and the

01:48.200 --> 01:53.240
first one came from John. John wrote in to kind of rib us Arch users. He says, hey Chris and Matt,

01:53.240 --> 01:57.960
I just have to tease you for beginning your show by talking about Arch regressions and then go on

01:57.960 --> 02:02.760
to worry about Mint having potential to break. Currently Linux Mint works and there are a few

02:02.760 --> 02:07.440
problems I have with it. Yeah I might not work right on other distros but I, and I think he's

02:07.440 --> 02:12.240
talking about Cinnamon, I honestly doubt if Clem even cares about that. A quick look at the Linux

02:12.240 --> 02:16.880
Mint website will tell you they are self-sustaining distro then they are self-financed too. Maybe this

02:16.880 --> 02:21.280
is Mint's way of pushing back at the ultra accelerated pace that distros like Arch rev up.

02:21.280 --> 02:26.560
What is wrong with Debian style of a revenue distro? Maybe it's an issue of two different

02:26.560 --> 02:30.160
worlds. One world that's building a future of Linux and then there's the world that uses Linux

02:30.160 --> 02:35.120
to do things unrelated to the development of Linux. Those who want something that works because

02:35.120 --> 02:42.120
it's been rigorously tested. Cheers John. So Matt do you think maybe this is the Linux Mint's push

02:42.120 --> 02:47.320
back at these crazy rolling distro world that we seem to be moving towards? I think maybe

02:47.320 --> 02:53.800
inadvertently. I don't think it's done on purpose or with any type of real direct push back but I

02:53.800 --> 02:57.600
definitely think that they're going for, you know, they're going for some stability and they're also

02:57.600 --> 03:02.520
catering to a different audience of people. Yeah and I think there is a bit of like two worlds at

03:02.520 --> 03:07.720
play here too and I also think it's a good point that Linux Mint doesn't really need Cinnamon or

03:07.720 --> 03:12.360
Mate to be used anywhere. It's anywhere else. I mean it's in their benefit and best interest if

03:12.360 --> 03:17.340
it does and I'm sure they want to see it used elsewhere but they are self-funded by their users

03:17.340 --> 03:22.040
and so that allows them the flexibility to really focus on just building what they think is best

03:22.040 --> 03:27.080
for them and if that means creating their own desktop that only they have, if that's what Clem

03:27.080 --> 03:31.440
believes is the way to accomplish that mission it makes sense that's what he's gonna do. So yeah,

03:31.440 --> 03:36.000
I think it's interesting. We'll see. We'll keep watching it. I actually am really glad they're

03:36.000 --> 03:41.480
doing it. I think it's a grand experiment because I've always, you know, I've always speculated

03:41.480 --> 03:46.720
like if you know if I had a perfect Linux distro it would be something kind of like what Linux Mint

03:46.720 --> 03:52.200
is doing or like elementary does where only would be more user land updates really fresh user land

03:52.200 --> 03:57.500
but really stable base stuff as much as possible and that's essentially what we're gonna see for

03:57.500 --> 04:01.400
Mint so it's an experiment that I've been rattling around the back of my brain for a long time and

04:01.400 --> 04:07.360
now we're gonna see it come to life. So my cookie wrote in, my cookie, he says, hi Chris and we got

04:07.360 --> 04:11.200
this a lot and this is just a nice concise question so I wanted to get to this. On a previous

04:11.200 --> 04:16.240
Unplugged you hinted that Chase might end up on Linux Mint after thinking on what to choose. Yet

04:16.240 --> 04:21.040
once I watched the episode he ended up on Ubuntu. Why did Chase choose Ubuntu over Linux Mint? Now

04:21.040 --> 04:26.240
I wanted to get to this here because we've talked a lot about how to Linux here in the show and the

04:26.240 --> 04:31.920
current format of how to Linux is really the representation of months and months of thinking

04:31.920 --> 04:35.240
like and then Chase you know thinking about swishing and so we've come to a lot of we've

04:35.240 --> 04:38.480
had a lot of discussions and conclusions outside the show and then what you see in the show is the

04:38.480 --> 04:43.600
manifestation of all that work and the essential reason was we figured a lot of people watching

04:43.600 --> 04:48.160
will be starting there we're not sticking with any one particular distribution and Chase kind of

04:48.160 --> 04:54.440
felt like because the choice is so overwhelming he was he was willing to hold off on making full

04:54.440 --> 04:58.680
gone conclusions and try out Ubuntu see what he thought and then also be willing to try the thing

04:58.680 --> 05:03.760
so you have to stay tuned to find out what happens there my cookie but we one of the biggest biggest

05:03.760 --> 05:07.720
pieces of feedback was why didn't you put the explanation in the show it's because we'd already

05:07.720 --> 05:12.400
decided before the show and it is just a process and we wanted to make it quick because we feel a

05:12.400 --> 05:16.800
lot that's where a lot of people are gonna start so thanks for asking my cookie Matt before we get

05:16.800 --> 05:20.480
on before we get onto the rest of the show and we got one more email I want to stop right here

05:20.480 --> 05:26.000
and think ting that's right go over to Linux dot ting comm that'll save $25 off your first device

05:26.000 --> 05:33.040
or $25 off your first month of service and we got an email came in from Brad he says dear Chris and

05:33.040 --> 05:38.640
Brad I've switched to ting I've been saving for I've been saving up for a phone so I could make

05:38.640 --> 05:43.520
the switch and I finally accumulated the scratch and bought a Nexus 5 booyah I've been getting

05:43.520 --> 05:49.760
boned by t-mobile for years now and now I'm free free I say I mean it was like walking in McDonald's

05:49.760 --> 05:56.120
and paying for nine hamburgers and only eating one every month what the who does that I activated my

05:56.120 --> 06:01.600
phone entirely online in like ten minutes and like Chris likes to say Bob indeed was made my uncle

06:01.600 --> 06:06.400
with ting I'm totally only paying for what I use which isn't much and currently with the last

06:06.400 --> 06:10.960
discount I get the first month for free I actually end up only oh I'm sorry I only ended up owing

06:10.960 --> 06:16.200
them a buck seriously a buck a friggin dollar so thanks gentlemen if you're ever in LA I owe you a

06:16.200 --> 06:21.460
cupious amounts of beer sincerely Brad and his last name is pronounced kale oh like the healthy

06:21.460 --> 06:26.280
snack so go over to Linux dot ting comm to check it out ting why is ting different because there's

06:26.280 --> 06:31.160
no contracts there's no early termination fee and like Brad said you only pay for what you use it's a

06:31.160 --> 06:35.600
flat six dollars plus whatever the man's gonna put on top of that he's got to get his cut he or

06:35.600 --> 06:40.760
she the man's really not an actual person and then it's just your usage so your megabytes your

06:40.760 --> 06:44.800
messages your minutes whatever buckets you fall into after all that's added up that's what you pay

06:44.800 --> 06:51.280
and be like Brad I recommend go get the Nexus 5 $349 that's you own it price that's not you

06:51.280 --> 06:55.880
spreading the cost out over two years that's what you own and just like when you buy yourself a

06:55.880 --> 07:00.560
computer you'll want to own it it's your device that's what's great about ting you get this Nexus

07:00.560 --> 07:05.500
5 one of the best Android phones out there even still today $350 when you go to Linux dot ting

07:05.500 --> 07:10.200
comm then it's six dollars a month after that that's all you pay your usage plus ting has an

07:10.200 --> 07:14.120
awesome dashboard that lets you manage it and best of all if you ever get stuck or if you want

07:14.120 --> 07:18.040
to have multiple people on your account you'll appreciate this one they have rockin good customer

07:18.040 --> 07:24.040
service you can call anytime between 8 a.m. or 8 p.m. Eastern at 1 8 5 5 ting FTW and a real

07:24.040 --> 07:28.760
person answers the phone and that person it's not like a oh hi thanks for calling ting please hold

07:28.760 --> 07:33.160
or what's your problem and that person's like hi thanks for calling ting how can I help you I'm

07:33.160 --> 07:36.840
actually the person that's gonna help you and yes a real person just answered the phone when you

07:36.840 --> 07:40.960
call the company support number that's that's it's incredible and like Brad said their control

07:40.960 --> 07:46.920
panel so awesome Matt and I have both activated and deactivated multiple devices all through the

07:46.920 --> 07:51.000
online control panel with zero problems it's awesome and if we ever did get stuck we know

07:51.000 --> 07:56.440
we have that customer service really nice Linux dot ting comm that'll tell them hey thanks for

07:56.440 --> 08:00.760
supporting Linux unplug I really appreciate you guys keeping them on the air that also gives you

08:00.760 --> 08:05.080
a chance to try out their savings calculator just plug your current bill in now think about this too

08:05.080 --> 08:09.400
when you're plugging your bill into their savings calculator put the numbers in that you actually

08:09.400 --> 08:14.760
use not what you pay into because that's a gimmick that your cell carrier has tricked you into thinking

08:14.760 --> 08:18.800
is the way to pay for things when you're doing their savings calculator put your actual usage

08:18.800 --> 08:24.060
in there and then be it's astonished at the difference Linux dot ting comm and a big thank

08:24.060 --> 08:28.880
you to ting for sponsoring Linux unplugged you guys rock and go over to their blog too they've

08:28.880 --> 08:33.080
got another behind the scenes video they just posted up that you guys might want to check out

08:33.080 --> 08:38.920
so Matt join us on the mumble line is the founder of bedrock Linux paradigm hey paradigm welcome to

08:38.920 --> 08:45.360
the show thanks for being here man we really appreciate it so tell us so when did you start

08:45.360 --> 08:59.480
working on paradigm so I started there isn't really a good firm starting date I didn't realize

08:59.480 --> 09:05.520
what it became when I started playing around with it yeah so I'm guessing around 2008 to 2010 was

09:05.520 --> 09:11.240
when the ideas started for me waiting for it got me where and then the first public release was 2012

09:11.240 --> 09:17.440
and I gather like a lot of projects it was really like this is just something I want like I'm sick

09:17.440 --> 09:22.120
of having to pick between Debian and arch or whatever you just looked out of all and said

09:22.120 --> 09:28.440
I want all but at once right yes exactly that's bold and how has the response been to this because

09:28.440 --> 09:34.480
I know I mean I've seen presentations far back as 2012 but yet I still don't see a lot of talk

09:34.480 --> 09:38.600
about it I am seeing more these days so I do you think response is improving are people starting

09:38.600 --> 09:43.320
to grok the idea I think the main concern the main thing keeping people away is that it's still

09:43.320 --> 09:49.480
labeled alpha it there's still a lot of work that has to be done I expect that when that's when we're

09:49.480 --> 09:53.960
past that it's a stable release if there's gonna be more tension that's what's gonna happen I'm

09:53.960 --> 09:58.160
okay with the slow development sure it's actually kind of a good thing in a way isn't it because it

09:58.160 --> 10:02.840
sort of slowly brings in more people and and and sort of doesn't make it an insane base that's all

10:02.840 --> 10:08.400
of a sudden using your code so would you mind in your own words summarizing what bedrock Linux

10:08.400 --> 10:11.720
is and what makes it different for maybe folks who didn't watch the Sunday's Linux action show

10:11.720 --> 10:18.340
sure I'll try to use different phrasing than I did when you quoted me earlier on the show Sunday

10:18.340 --> 10:25.880
so when you use a Linux distribution what they actually do for you is provide a lot of software

10:25.880 --> 10:29.640
that they've packaged it's all out there so the question is whose package you put together to make

10:29.640 --> 10:34.880
sure it all works but you have to pick which group of packages from which distribution if you want

10:34.880 --> 10:38.680
something stable you know like rel or Debian if you want something cutting edge just like arch and

10:38.680 --> 10:43.480
so on and so on every just rises its own advantages and disadvantages maybe been better like Linux is

10:43.480 --> 10:48.080
that you can install software from any of those distributions so that it runs natively just like

10:48.080 --> 10:52.980
it was needed for the distro no VM overhead no containers restricting what you can do just if

10:52.980 --> 10:57.000
you if you want parts from different distros at the same time that rocks how you there's one way

10:57.000 --> 11:03.360
to go about it now if you were starting bedrock today 2014 of June would you start with something

11:03.360 --> 11:07.440
that was more Docker based or do you still think that this is perhaps a different approach or a

11:07.440 --> 11:12.600
better approach than just straight-up container ization so I actually just added today a new

11:12.600 --> 11:16.400
frequently asked questions thing on Docker since that that's coming quite a bit right

11:16.400 --> 11:22.680
Docker is doing something different Docker is purposefully containing things so that they can't

11:22.680 --> 11:26.680
interact with each other there's a lot of benefits to this I'm not saying it's a bad idea but it's a

11:26.680 --> 11:32.680
very different goal if you're using Docker you can't for example say install some program then

11:32.680 --> 11:37.240
Ron man to get the man page for it you have to actually go into the the Docker container for it

11:37.240 --> 11:42.600
so no I would not switch the techniques I still think that the technique I'm currently using is

11:42.600 --> 11:46.240
about the best way to go about it given the resources I have at hand and I think the thing

11:46.240 --> 11:51.880
to underscore here is this isn't virtual ization and so it is native metal performance and I could

11:51.880 --> 11:57.000
have an application running from an arch client and an application running from a Firefox client

11:57.000 --> 12:01.840
and they could interact they could pass data amongst each other yes exactly for the most part

12:01.840 --> 12:06.600
it all feels native like if you don't realize if you don't do anything to point out data usage it

12:06.600 --> 12:11.440
feels like any other distro so does this get massive like that on the disk am I do I end up

12:11.440 --> 12:16.600
essentially with the equivalent of an arch a full arch installation a Debian installation an Ubuntu

12:16.600 --> 12:21.760
you know a fedora whatever I decide to install as a client do I do I need to have just a ton of disk

12:21.760 --> 12:26.000
space that is definitely an issue with the techniques we're currently using we have some

12:26.000 --> 12:30.360
ideas and how to fix that in the long term but we're not gonna get them done anytime soon yeah

12:30.360 --> 12:36.640
I mean how would you even go about that the main concern with that is actually telling me package

12:36.640 --> 12:42.800
managers that certain dependencies have been met elsewhere and you have to go do a lot of work

12:42.800 --> 12:48.040
specific to each package manager to get that done in automated fashion it's also not entirely clear

12:48.040 --> 12:53.280
that a given library will meet the needs from like a different distro so what ends up happening on

12:53.280 --> 12:57.840
bedrock right now is that you'll have multiple versions of any given dependency if multiple

12:57.840 --> 13:02.120
things need them they're not shared but there are some theoretical things that could be done

13:02.120 --> 13:06.720
if it's a high enough priority could I run multiple versions of the same distribution so

13:06.720 --> 13:13.720
could I have 1204 and and 1404 as clients and and mix and match match between those two sure

13:13.720 --> 13:24.320
yeah I just I think I look at I look at bedrock Linux as as maybe a power desktop Linux users

13:24.320 --> 13:30.320
perfect scenario is that who you're targeting in your mind when you're developing this so the the

13:30.320 --> 13:35.160
key target audience for bedrock Linux is myself if other people want to use it great I'm just

13:35.160 --> 13:42.920
trying to make it for me and it's for your desktop or server you run it on a server laptop I do I'm

13:42.920 --> 13:47.360
not convinced it's the best option I think something like Coral West will give you advantageous

13:47.360 --> 13:52.120
what bedrock does isn't as helpful on a server because things aren't just like they don't need

13:52.120 --> 13:55.920
to interact quite as much as they wouldn't have desktop but it works fine okay well I've got some

13:55.920 --> 14:01.480
some functionality and usage questions for you so I'm gonna and also I'll move us up into the main

14:01.480 --> 14:05.800
mumble room too so they can jump in and ask questions so I guess where I wanted to start with

14:05.800 --> 14:13.480
is are there already tools in place to do client all client updates so I could execute a yum upgrade

14:13.480 --> 14:22.320
and an app git dash upgrade and a pac-man upgrade from one for one bedrock command so we had one that

14:22.320 --> 14:26.600
did that but I decided I wanted the name of that utility used elsewhere we end up dropping it

14:26.600 --> 14:31.400
temporarily in the long term we want to have we have a project that we're calling the package

14:31.400 --> 14:38.440
manager manager or PMM and in theory you could run some PMM commands that would do that okay and I

14:38.440 --> 14:43.840
kind of also had a question I noticed how do you choose the kernel so my bedrock installation was

14:43.840 --> 14:47.520
using an arch kernel is that something that installation you just pick the distros kernel

14:47.520 --> 14:53.520
you want originally I think I mean the first alpha I recommended compiling your own kernel

14:53.520 --> 14:57.560
which kept a lot of people away but after some experimentation I realized that for the most part

14:57.560 --> 15:04.160
any one external works and just about any distro you might lose some features like system tap but

15:04.160 --> 15:08.880
yeah you can just use whatever so my recommendation is that you install kernel from a client and just

15:08.880 --> 15:15.680
use that and so how about how many people are working on the bedrock Linux team now I'm the

15:15.680 --> 15:20.520
majority of it I think well over 90% of the lines of code currently in their mind but there are a

15:20.520 --> 15:25.080
good number of other people who contribute what they can when they have time I'm trying to give

15:25.080 --> 15:31.320
an estimate depending on where you draw the line it's maybe five total wouldn't be go ahead ask

15:31.320 --> 15:37.080
your question I was just curious what problem were you setting out to solve when you first created

15:37.080 --> 15:42.760
bedrock Linux so there's a famous story with RMS having trouble with a printer which is why you

15:42.760 --> 15:50.440
started the canoe projects I had a similar issue I had to I was using Debian stable at the time

15:50.440 --> 15:55.800
my printer broke I got a new one and the drivers didn't work and I did spend a lot of time making

15:55.800 --> 16:00.360
that work when I realized if I could just get this one package from Debian state or arch that

16:00.360 --> 16:05.240
would that would solve that completely and so I did that I set that up and I just kept iterating

16:05.240 --> 16:14.160
over it from there until there's it's its own distro I also like the story you shared where

16:14.160 --> 16:18.960
there was a bug with comp is and one distribution had one part of the solution the other distribution

16:18.960 --> 16:22.520
of the other part of the solution you're able to bring those two together and I've been in that

16:22.520 --> 16:26.800
scenario myself especially though see the reason why I asked you about the desktop question is

16:26.800 --> 16:31.320
because I have very very much been in the server space where we were just on the pre show talking

16:31.320 --> 16:36.960
about Red Hat Enterprise 7 and so many times I've been on a CentOS box or Red Hat Enterprise box and

16:36.960 --> 16:43.320
I've just thought if I could just manage this one set of applications through apt or if I could just

16:43.320 --> 16:50.720
get this PPA or whatever it would make so much of my work easier and bedrock sort of seems to me to

16:50.720 --> 16:57.760
have the promise if I could base the core bedrock kernel on a CentOS kernel so essentially I'm CentOS

16:57.760 --> 17:03.120
on the whole stack but bedrocks actually managing the user land I could essentially accomplish that

17:03.120 --> 17:08.520
couldn't I paradise yes and in fact that's what I'm doing on the server it's exactly the reason

17:08.520 --> 17:14.840
it's mostly diving stable but I do have occasional occasions from elsewhere go ahead crossroads so I

17:14.840 --> 17:22.520
was wondering how you'll handle the image system will you use system D or will you write your will

17:22.520 --> 17:29.320
you write your own in it the custom in its system for bedrock that's that's actually a really good

17:29.320 --> 17:34.520
question currently one of the main areas that better our clinics has issues isn't it most

17:34.520 --> 17:39.560
things just work as long as they're not closely tied to in it when better started there was no

17:39.560 --> 17:49.240
system D most things were system 5 or similar and that ended up working quite nicely system D I have

17:49.240 --> 17:53.760
to be here with my phrasing here say it's really picky about how it does certain things and it

17:53.760 --> 17:59.520
doesn't want to play with bedrock very well so we have to come up with some new solutions that

17:59.520 --> 18:04.560
particular issue currently bedrock Linux uses its own busybox based in it which is super duper

18:04.560 --> 18:10.320
limited but in the long term we're going to try to make other in its systems options just like you

18:10.320 --> 18:14.400
can have for the main user lane whatever packages you want I'm going to try to make it so that you

18:14.400 --> 18:19.600
can use whatever neat system you want Wow Riley go ahead yes I was wondering like have you had

18:19.600 --> 18:28.200
any issues with the bigger disk shows getting mad at you pulling down their packages and installing

18:28.200 --> 18:33.840
it on bedrock when it's not really that dish show like I remember a while back that canonical got

18:33.840 --> 18:45.400
mad at MIT for accessing their repos the servers sorry it's just that's that's misrepresenting what

18:45.400 --> 18:51.920
happened but go on but the broader question is have you heard have you heard any put have you

18:51.920 --> 19:02.600
got any pushback from upstream distros I've I've not had anyone be upset by that yet I think we

19:02.600 --> 19:05.960
may not be big enough yet to get that attention if that's something that's coming later off the

19:05.960 --> 19:12.320
handle it however that the question is really what is the distro that you're using is bedrock

19:12.320 --> 19:16.440
when it's just acting like a hypervisor you're really using some other distro in which case

19:16.440 --> 19:21.160
you're using the software they're providing and the repos they're providing for that purpose so

19:21.160 --> 19:26.240
there's some arguments can be made right it is their user land yes yeah it's just not their

19:26.240 --> 19:30.320
kernel which what's the difference if you downloaded Ubuntu and swapped out the kernel

19:30.320 --> 19:34.760
it's almost the same the same from the distribution standpoint go ahead blue Phoenix I know you had a

19:34.760 --> 19:41.240
question we wanted to get in what about switching in its system like gentoo does some applications

19:41.240 --> 19:46.680
I mean gentoo uses open RC but like if you're gonna use gnome then you can switch to system D

19:46.680 --> 19:55.240
so the the trouble with unit stuff is it gets really complicated specifically things like

19:55.240 --> 20:01.280
upstart and system D the way they're designed is really inflexible given what bedrock clinics is

20:01.280 --> 20:06.160
trying to do and some of the tools we're using like system D will actually check when it's

20:06.160 --> 20:09.760
starting if you're using some of the techniques that bedrock clinics it does do and then refuse

20:09.760 --> 20:17.760
to operate so it's not as simple as just switching it out there's me a bit more work I see heavens

20:17.760 --> 20:25.080
revenge has a question go ahead heavens okay well there is a situation in which I can't quite

20:25.080 --> 20:30.680
wrap my head around let's say you start from a base system and of course you know you usually

20:30.680 --> 20:36.600
start with installing X at least before you used to go distro or desktop environment first you'd

20:36.600 --> 20:42.400
go X first then maybe the toolkit and then maybe the desktop environment what happens when you go

20:42.400 --> 20:50.800
a stable X pull something bleeding edge like a bleeding edge KDE or GTK from arch and then go

20:50.800 --> 20:58.160
back and switch to a stable desktop environment where that is trying to find updated API calls

20:58.160 --> 21:08.280
in the stable version of the toolkit that you're using so if I if I followed that correctly your

21:08.280 --> 21:14.440
concern has to is going to be met by the fact that if something has a dependency that will be

21:14.440 --> 21:18.960
provided by the same distro which is one of the reasons we have to take so much disk space is we

21:18.960 --> 21:23.320
have multiple copies a lot of dependencies so something is using a given toolkit and they're

21:23.320 --> 21:27.880
sad it's it's missing they'll end up having their own so that that doesn't happen very good all

21:27.880 --> 21:33.800
right look static no literally there'll be multiple copies of something like GTK so something

21:33.800 --> 21:37.240
wants one specific version of GTK and something else wants a different version they'll both be

21:37.240 --> 21:41.880
installed on disk that seems I mean I know some people are gonna scoff at the disk space usually

21:41.880 --> 21:45.000
there but that seems like if you're if you want to do this kind of thing and disks are cheap that

21:45.000 --> 21:50.000
seems like a fair trade-off for what you're actually getting and so when you install KDE

21:50.000 --> 21:55.480
do you actually install a KDE and all of its complete dependency tree from that specific

21:55.480 --> 22:02.680
repo or distribution and then have little kind of hierarchies within their own roots yes if you

22:02.680 --> 22:08.000
install something like KDE you'll get the entire if you're installing it using that given distros

22:08.000 --> 22:12.040
package manager and it does its own dependency resolution the way it typically would natively

22:12.040 --> 22:15.920
you'll get all of those dependencies it's like if you were running that distribution and you just

22:15.920 --> 22:19.720
installed KDE it will do all of the actions it would do when you perform that action so if it

22:19.720 --> 22:25.960
if you if there's a meta KDE package that installs 300 dependencies it would do that okay I was

22:25.960 --> 22:31.280
thinking of excess shared containers which they share a little bit more interdependencies between

22:31.280 --> 22:38.680
them but I guess they're very very inter independent of each other okay so I wonder how oh go ahead

22:38.680 --> 22:44.640
yeah how closely independent they are or how how much they're interacting with each other is

22:44.640 --> 22:48.800
configurable given the way they're using it so if you want to try to do something like that you can

22:48.800 --> 22:53.760
by default I'm trying to find a same compromise between things not conflicting with each other

22:53.760 --> 22:59.200
and things just working interacting we'd expect all right I want to get a couple more questions

22:59.200 --> 23:05.500
in before we go so I wanted to have crossroads that kind of finish this up with his last two

23:05.500 --> 23:11.600
questions here go ahead crossroads okay so my first question is how does bedrock handle GUI

23:11.600 --> 23:19.040
so when it's when you have a GUI running how does that work how does one particular client display

23:19.040 --> 23:28.320
a GUI it's talks to Xorg or Wayland the same way it would natively like it doesn't they're not

23:28.320 --> 23:32.400
contained it doesn't know that it's not there it doesn't know that the version of Xorg is talking

23:32.400 --> 23:38.720
to happens to be different from what it's used to and my last question was oh if you could take

23:38.720 --> 23:42.920
a time machine five years in the future where would you want to see bedrock or where do you

23:42.920 --> 23:50.040
see it being in five years I see it being roughly where you see something like slackware who's a

23:50.040 --> 23:57.480
popularity like people notes they're not everyone uses it however it's you know I obviously be very

23:57.480 --> 24:01.560
different from slackware in terms of what the projects doing I expect I'd like to have a niche

24:01.560 --> 24:07.000
number of people who are using in a community but I don't expect it to take over everything I like

24:07.000 --> 24:11.120
that and so I think we have a lot of people that want to know how they can help contribute where

24:11.120 --> 24:18.120
should they go to get involved or see if there's a way they could help so on our website I have I

24:18.120 --> 24:22.240
think a quick question item on that but basically you can look our issue tracker there's something

24:22.240 --> 24:27.880
you think you can take go ahead and let me know and go at it if you see some other issues that

24:27.880 --> 24:31.680
are missing from there you can add them I think that the biggest thing though that that can be

24:31.680 --> 24:36.560
done is to actually install it and use it and let me know what issues you find because I can't fix

24:36.560 --> 24:41.600
issues that come up and workflow is different from mine like I don't actually use many desktop

24:41.600 --> 24:45.680
environments so if there's some issue with those I wouldn't be aware of them so yeah just use it

24:45.680 --> 24:50.320
and let me know how it goes very good well you are welcome to stick around and join us any time

24:50.320 --> 24:53.960
to the mumble room is always open when we're doing the unplug show and I'd like to get your

24:53.960 --> 24:59.040
guys's thoughts on on this next topic we have coming up to and we'll discuss more in the post

24:59.040 --> 25:02.400
show so it's been great and guys go over go over to the show notes we've got links for bedrock

25:02.400 --> 25:07.280
Linux and I think about you Matt but bedrock Linux to me is like one of the most interesting

25:07.280 --> 25:12.760
distributions in ten years oh easily I think it could actually set the pace for the way things

25:12.760 --> 25:17.240
are done in the future maybe not exactly the way it's being done currently but I think it does set

25:17.240 --> 25:21.680
a pace and a different set of expectations that we could watch expand over time I like that I like

25:21.680 --> 25:27.480
that that sort of you know slack where it has sort of a really soft spot in the community's heart

25:27.480 --> 25:32.920
there's a lot of passionate slackers out there and you know I think it's it's still a distribution

25:32.920 --> 25:36.440
that carries some weight every time we talk about on the show we end up hearing from somebody that's

25:36.440 --> 25:41.200
that's not a bad goal at all I would I'd be very happy to have a distribution at that level and I

25:41.200 --> 25:45.200
think it's possible bedrock Linux offers something that I think will really appeal to a certain set

25:45.200 --> 25:49.720
of Linux users so you heard the man go out there and try it out go to bedrock Linux a site and

25:49.720 --> 25:56.120
download it and deploy it and bang on it for him it's not not necessarily for those of you who are

25:56.120 --> 26:00.960
maybe not a little more gray in the beard it takes some Linux skills but if you've got some or if you

26:00.960 --> 26:04.800
want to challenge him you can go do it and you go always try it out in virtualization too so you

26:04.800 --> 26:09.000
could always snapshot and whatnot speaking of which man I want to thank our next sponsor on the Linux

26:09.000 --> 26:13.400
unplugged show and that is digital ocean go over to digital ocean calm and guess what we've got a

26:13.400 --> 26:19.440
nice June promo code unplugged June to get you a $10 credit over at digital ocean digital ocean

26:19.440 --> 26:23.400
is simple cloud hosting and they're dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way to spin

26:23.400 --> 26:29.000
up a cloud server users can create a cloud server in about 55 seconds maybe less if you're a pro

26:29.000 --> 26:36.000
like our audience and pricing plan started only five dollars a month for 512 megabytes of RAM a

26:36.000 --> 26:42.400
20 gigabyte SSD a blazing fast CPU and 1 terabyte of transfer in digital ocean has data center

26:42.400 --> 26:48.000
locations in New York San Francisco Singapore and Amsterdam man I'd love to be the IT guy that gets

26:48.000 --> 26:52.200
sent to work at the Amsterdam data center and of course their interface is simple their control

26:52.200 --> 26:56.560
panel is intuitive and power use can replicate on a much larger scale with their API and you're

26:56.560 --> 27:00.720
seeing people take advantage of that in really cool ways there's so many great things I could

27:00.720 --> 27:06.040
talk about with digital ocean I think what I'd like to focus on is how much I really appreciate

27:06.040 --> 27:10.360
how they've rocked so many aspects of this it made it they've it is a combination of their

27:10.360 --> 27:14.080
dashboard that I talk a lot about it's a combination of those SSD drives which is an early

27:14.080 --> 27:19.040
investment I think they really saw the light on that it's the really great utilization of KVM to

27:19.040 --> 27:23.080
get the density on these things so incredibly high and one of the other things that's really

27:23.080 --> 27:27.640
fantastic about digital ocean is they have been on the cutting edge of Docker support Docker 1.0

27:27.640 --> 27:31.920
came out yesterday digital oceans already down with it man and a great thing about digital ocean

27:31.920 --> 27:35.880
is they're making it really easy to deploy some really great open source tools and things like

27:35.880 --> 27:42.640
GitLab you can deploy GitLab to dot to a droplet on digital ocean in no time it's it's things like

27:42.640 --> 27:46.920
this where you can make a template image and then redeploy it when you need and they have hourly

27:46.920 --> 27:50.920
pricing so you can take this template get it up and running bang on it for a few hours and shut

27:50.920 --> 27:56.160
it down and with our toned up with our $10 credit when you use unplug June that's gonna last forever

27:56.160 --> 28:01.360
I mean it's this value combined with this technology and it's the technology that we all

28:01.360 --> 28:05.560
support it's the technology that we all love combined with their investment SSDs these data

28:05.560 --> 28:09.400
centers all over the world they really are a really cool company and they're doing something

28:09.400 --> 28:13.080
different they have a different recipe than everybody else and that's why developers and

28:13.080 --> 28:17.600
Linux users and power users and people that just want to learn alike are all responding so strongly

28:17.600 --> 28:22.800
to digital ocean go to digital ocean comm and use the promo code unplugged June go get a $10

28:22.800 --> 28:27.600
credit trap that $5 rig for two months you'll just get it for for two months for free that's

28:27.600 --> 28:32.680
a terabyte of transfer you can use and just put bit torrent sync up there put own cloud up there

28:32.680 --> 28:38.080
just begin to take back and control a little part put subsonic up there shoot I don't know put plex

28:38.080 --> 28:44.560
up don't know I don't know about that maybe maybe I put a VPN then you could do it well here's how

28:44.560 --> 28:48.120
what I did and I and I wouldn't necessarily go with that direction in the media but I think so

28:48.120 --> 28:52.080
we have some folks that do have plex up there you know it could work right it could work but

28:52.080 --> 28:56.480
I would want to make it secure yeah you wanted to make it secure I mean for myself I'm actually

28:56.480 --> 29:03.080
looking at doing an own cloud because I really want to make sure I have access to my documents

29:03.080 --> 29:07.720
number one going I'm also looking to drop Dropbox so this is a project I've taken up and I was

29:07.720 --> 29:13.080
originally just doing it just a bit torrent sync part of my house but was soon as soon as I started

29:13.080 --> 29:16.480
putting stuff up on my digital ocean droplet then I was like oh wait a minute now I can get

29:16.480 --> 29:20.880
to it from my Android phone when I'm on the road without having to mess with any firewall stuff on

29:20.880 --> 29:24.880
my home router and it it just and then it's like oh and then I have another sync point it's up in

29:24.880 --> 29:28.040
the cloud and it's like essentially off-site backup for me it just all these things started

29:28.040 --> 29:34.240
to click into place so check it out you guys all right so I'm a little upset I'm a little I don't

29:34.240 --> 29:38.160
want to I don't want to be all ranty and ravey I hate what I hate when I'm grumpy I know you guys

29:38.160 --> 29:46.320
do too so let's just jump in real quick we're just gonna do our valve update so Alienware got

29:46.320 --> 29:52.120
on my ass list today they had a little e3 announcement guess what ladies and gentlemen

29:52.120 --> 29:56.520
Alienware will be shipping their first steam machine in December despite the fact that valve

29:56.520 --> 30:02.200
has supposedly delayed them because they're taking a little shortcut Alienware's first steam machine

30:02.200 --> 30:07.040
will be shipping with Windows of course it will it's a it's a it's Dell jr. I mean what do you

30:07.040 --> 30:12.560
expect yeah they did it again Matt they did it again they did it again they switched to Windows

30:12.560 --> 30:16.200
they're they're shipping what they're calling the alpha version of the steam machine running

30:16.200 --> 30:20.880
Windows and the alien will develop Alienware developers has to have and this is a quote

30:20.880 --> 30:25.960
scripted up a new UI that makes the Windows interface more usable from a tent and from

30:25.960 --> 30:33.840
ten feet away and will make it easy to launch Steam big picture mode there you go hell you

30:33.840 --> 30:37.480
know it's Alienware I mean nothing they do really surprises me especially once that once

30:37.480 --> 30:41.240
uh Dell kind of took them under their wing they really went a totally different direction at that

30:41.240 --> 30:47.560
point it's really disappointing and I I mean like not only is it it's negative in the freedom

30:47.560 --> 30:54.640
dimension that's a given but also like I I can in a way understand like maybe like they were

30:54.640 --> 30:58.480
working hand-in-hand with valve and I was like yeah Alienware we're gonna do this you be our

30:58.480 --> 31:01.760
partner and then then all of a sudden I was like actually you know what just kidding we're gonna

31:01.760 --> 31:05.960
bump it to 2015 that's that's I mean that happened right valve so we're gonna bump steam machines

31:05.960 --> 31:10.200
and maybe Alienware was like well that's great Gabe but here I am with my with my wiener out

31:10.200 --> 31:15.560
and nothing's happening and now I'm kind of stuck to deliver I've got all these R&D guys we've paid

31:15.560 --> 31:19.840
for we've developed a product we've got all the shipping and marketing oh and by the way we've

31:19.840 --> 31:23.520
been working on a Windows one just in case your product sucked anyway so we're just gonna go with

31:23.520 --> 31:28.440
our plan B I feel like that's what happened well and it honestly makes me wonder how much which is

31:28.440 --> 31:32.360
really the plan B you know I mean really think about that if they were able to roll it out that

31:32.360 --> 31:36.640
easily but well I think they've been working on this from the beginning oh yeah that's kind of

31:36.640 --> 31:39.800
what I'm saying yeah I mean maybe or maybe they hacked it together I don't know maybe they did

31:39.800 --> 31:44.760
hack it together but I to me it feels like how do you just go well yeah but we've had these we've

31:44.760 --> 31:48.400
had some of our developers hacking together UI for this so we'll just go with that and you know

31:48.400 --> 31:55.160
got big picture mode this is yeah I don't know this is really disappointing and this is this

31:55.160 --> 31:59.600
is typical crap and I don't know I just I'm a little worried I don't like this is not a good

31:59.600 --> 32:04.320
start for the whole steam machine thing this is not this is not how I wanted it to begin but just

32:04.320 --> 32:09.160
sounds like still how passing things all over again with yeah I say that's all they've ever

32:09.160 --> 32:14.080
done well and but now the headline is is Alienware refit steam machine with Windows you're seeing

32:14.080 --> 32:17.740
that adventure beat it's on and gadget it's everywhere now that's the headline that's the

32:17.740 --> 32:22.960
headline now and it sets the tone and so that's gonna challenge valve to have to step up their

32:22.960 --> 32:28.120
game when they are ready to release and absolutely just really blow people away and that means

32:28.120 --> 32:34.640
getting in the headlines quick and early if the Reese they're scripting a new UI or whatever why

32:34.640 --> 32:40.800
are they doing that on Windows when that would be easier to do on a Linux system yeah I think it

32:40.800 --> 32:46.640
has Dell I think valve blew it I think I think what valve valve blew it by engaging with other

32:46.640 --> 32:50.480
companies valve should have just nutted up and just shipped a machine themselves and and not

32:50.480 --> 32:53.920
shipped it until it was ready and they should have it should have been the steam machine from

32:53.920 --> 33:00.040
valve and not worked with guys like the cube guys that blew it back at CES last year and these guys

33:00.040 --> 33:05.080
that are blowing it now this is not the first partner that's blowing it and this this is a

33:05.080 --> 33:10.680
big deal if they screw this up this is a big deal well I treat these guys just don't care what

33:10.680 --> 33:15.520
operating system they're shipping with they care whether they can supply the games that people want

33:15.520 --> 33:21.120
to put to their to the people who will buy steam boxes and the truth is that if you are going to

33:21.120 --> 33:27.320
ship a steam box today you have to have more triple a I agree and Linux just doesn't deliver

33:27.320 --> 33:35.080
there so they either have to wait and possibly another company could sweep in and ship with

33:35.080 --> 33:45.680
Windows and everything that valve supplies with Steam OS is actually available for for Windows

33:45.680 --> 33:51.520
already probably no one will stop you if you want to ship a set the box with that boot straight to

33:51.520 --> 33:58.000
this steam big picture a steam box running Windows is a failed product on launch you know why because

33:58.000 --> 34:02.800
we already have those those those already exist and they haven't gone anywhere it needs to be a

34:02.800 --> 34:08.520
differentiator it needs the steam box applies to somebody who wants to have a more appliance

34:08.520 --> 34:12.400
console like experience they don't want something that's running Windows that's just been lacquered

34:12.400 --> 34:16.400
over like media center was or what's what big picture mode is they want something it's a

34:16.400 --> 34:21.520
dedicated appliance box that's been blessed by valve the people who are maybe Mac users who

34:21.520 --> 34:25.760
can't play very many video games or people who are Xbox users who maybe don't really even mess

34:25.760 --> 34:29.680
with their PC very much maybe they have like a laptop you know like they don't even game on the

34:29.680 --> 34:35.240
PC that's who I see a steam box running Linux appealing to is somebody who wants a different

34:35.240 --> 34:40.320
solution because we already we've had big picture for over two years now I don't know a year at

34:40.320 --> 34:45.440
least yeah and it's gone nowhere right and we already have that and so now Alienware is gonna

34:45.440 --> 34:49.600
bundle up and package something with a too expensive price point because they are charging

34:49.600 --> 34:53.440
more for this because of the Windows license they said it in the press release they're gonna

34:53.440 --> 34:58.000
ship something that's more expensive that will play mediocre game graphics based on the specs

34:58.000 --> 35:03.680
of this thing and what there and it has this it has the steam box name it's a stinker all around

35:04.720 --> 35:12.560
I think it has to do with support no it doesn't I had Alienware that they sold with Ubuntu on it

35:12.560 --> 35:17.600
and then I had an issue with the CD drive when I called in the tech support uh when they found

35:17.600 --> 35:22.160
out I was using Ubuntu the first thing they said is we don't support Linux and I end up getting

35:22.160 --> 35:25.920
the escalated and it was a hardware problem because of the case design but their their

35:25.920 --> 35:30.240
first response is we don't support Linux yeah even though they sold it with Ubuntu on it right so

35:30.240 --> 35:37.920
go ahead run no go ahead run uh doesn't I could be wrong but doesn't Valve have a rule like a

35:37.920 --> 35:42.080
guidelines that you have to agree to in order to call it a steam machine or a steam box I don't

35:42.080 --> 35:47.040
know Google has AOSP I know I know that the press is calling it a steam machine that's what I was

35:47.040 --> 35:51.520
saying is uh they need to draw the line and saying and saying if you're gonna call this a steam box

35:51.520 --> 35:54.480
you need to make sure it runs Linux and not Windows you know if you look at the headline

35:54.480 --> 35:59.600
it says steam machine but I did I think that's I think that's a that's a very it doesn't matter

35:59.600 --> 36:03.920
that what matters is the perception that headline creates steam box steam machine it could be that's

36:03.920 --> 36:07.920
interchangeable for the for the impression it's going to create and despite how much I dislike

36:07.920 --> 36:13.840
companies doing this can't uh steam contact the the uh companies who are putting that headline

36:13.840 --> 36:19.120
out there uh or the media organizations and tell them that's not what this is please remove that

36:19.120 --> 36:22.960
you're insinuating you know you're you're talking about our product the steam machine that's not

36:22.960 --> 36:29.040
that yeah I don't know I don't know I mean maybe I mean I can answer that question so

36:29.920 --> 36:34.320
go ahead man well I I can answer that question um I I receive those all the time and usually after

36:34.320 --> 36:39.440
I'm done laughing at them and sending them to my inbox um yeah the point is is that send me a cease

36:39.440 --> 36:44.480
and desist until it's legal they can bite me um that that's that's the most of the philosophy

36:44.480 --> 36:49.600
of most editors unless there's a real compelling legal concern from the legal department no one

36:49.600 --> 36:54.880
cares it's an interpretive statement so the title being the steam machine well it's running steam

36:54.880 --> 36:58.640
and it is a machine that can be interpreted they can then fight it out in court or they

36:58.640 --> 37:02.640
can accept the fact that there really isn't much right and and the thing too is like valve is not

37:02.640 --> 37:07.360
going to want the bad pr but I want also the thing is is what the way alienware is positioning this

37:07.360 --> 37:13.840
is they're even calling it alpha this is rev one we're shipping our first version with windows

37:13.840 --> 37:20.160
and then later potentially maybe possibly kind of we might put linux on them in future versions that

37:20.160 --> 37:24.240
we won't be calling alpha anymore we just want to see if the concept works even though it won't be

37:24.240 --> 37:28.240
anything like the final product we want to see if the concept works and so that's why they're

37:28.240 --> 37:31.680
calling it a steam machine because eventually maybe it kind of could possibly run steam os

37:32.480 --> 37:36.960
you gotta wonder does anyone else here smell microsoft stink on this because they do have a

37:36.960 --> 37:43.040
real tight relationship this is what i've been saying um microsoft and dell are known to be

37:43.040 --> 37:51.760
like very simpatico together um what's that i would agree with heavens this is not the

37:51.760 --> 37:57.120
microsoft thing at all it's just better currently if you are going to ship like i said before if

37:57.120 --> 38:03.200
you're going to ship a steam box it's easier to do it with windows because of bigger library to

38:03.200 --> 38:12.320
games you'll appeal to wider uh i think people who do it don't care absolutely at all um about

38:12.320 --> 38:18.000
what operating systems they're shipping with and we care too much um the truth is probably

38:18.880 --> 38:25.280
yeah yeah we care too much about linux to have a kind of a clear perspective on this

38:25.280 --> 38:31.600
all right vr mac vr mac you want to give us a dose of reality go ahead i think the uh the thing

38:31.600 --> 38:35.120
that this all boils down to is the fact that dell's a business and regardless of if they

38:35.120 --> 38:39.040
have any sort of alliance with microsoft or whatever conspiracy you may think they're

38:39.040 --> 38:41.920
they're a business and all they really care about is making money and they see this as

38:41.920 --> 38:46.880
an opportunity to get a profit this is a really good opportunity for them too because as we know

38:46.880 --> 38:52.480
of x for playstation 4 and xbox one guess what they're using x86 chips yeah i just this is the

38:52.480 --> 38:56.720
future of gaming tell isn't very good at making money in the consumer space anymore i mean they're

38:56.720 --> 39:02.400
kind of laughed at or converging this is this is this has now become the ultimate dell product

39:02.400 --> 39:07.760
where they half ass it they they start ambitious and then they cut it and cut it down this isn't

39:07.760 --> 39:13.120
going to be a successful product this is already a product that nobody wants i mean it's like okay

39:13.120 --> 39:16.960
fine they want to go with windows great give me specs that i actually give a rat's butt about

39:16.960 --> 39:20.480
then i might at least acknowledge that they're actually trying the problem the problem is is

39:20.480 --> 39:26.160
when it runs windows you fundamentally have a complicated windows pc that you have to manage

39:26.160 --> 39:30.400
that's why windows the old traditional windows mobile failed it was too complicated for that

39:30.400 --> 39:36.880
type of device you you have to have a device that is dumb stupid i just want to effing play

39:36.880 --> 39:42.960
some video game simple i press a stupid little alien glowing button and it boots up this this

39:42.960 --> 39:49.040
shiny valve os and it boots right into this big picture mode and that's all it is it's nothing

39:49.040 --> 39:53.440
else it's not windows that's been scripted to have a 10 foot interface that you can launch

39:53.440 --> 39:58.400
big picture people don't want that it's going to be a failed product when they plug in their

39:58.400 --> 40:02.880
controller they're going to have to install some drivers yeah it ships with the xbox 360 wireless

40:02.880 --> 40:07.280
controller too that's what they're going with anyways it doesn't stink with microsoft at all

40:08.400 --> 40:12.560
yeah it's not even a little bit i said i i know some things about dell and microsoft that most

40:12.560 --> 40:16.960
people probably don't and i'm saying yes it does stick at microsoft of course you know what uh imicon

40:16.960 --> 40:20.480
points out in the chat room you never know maybe it will be successful and the steam machine name

40:20.480 --> 40:28.160
gets a good name and yeah right i don't think so uh yeah how about some uh how about some some good

40:28.160 --> 40:33.280
linux gaming news right so let's talk about linux taking over the gaming universe again uh i didn't

40:33.280 --> 40:38.400
really see this one coming today at least uh civilization 5 the strategy game is now native

40:38.400 --> 40:44.800
on linux it's an aspire port but it's a native aspire port the steam os release includes all

40:44.800 --> 40:50.800
civilization 5 dlc too and the expansion pack including gods and kings and brave new world this

40:50.800 --> 40:55.440
is over on gaming on linux.com uh and it was posted by uh liam who joined us a couple weeks

40:55.440 --> 41:02.080
ago on the show pretty big release for linux civilite this is one of the benchmark games and

41:02.080 --> 41:06.240
it's out it's out there right now you can go get it and download it i actually think i bought it

41:06.240 --> 41:11.520
like a while ago when it was on crazy sale sometimes i hedged my bets and so there you go

41:11.520 --> 41:15.680
that's a big game coming to linux and uh so that's a good that's some good news and i also

41:15.680 --> 41:20.400
wanted to share a little love with the krita product project krita am i saying that krita

41:20.400 --> 41:28.480
krita krita the uh the kde or the qt based uh digital painting software is doing a kick starter

41:28.480 --> 41:32.560
to sort of supercharge development and the main reason i wanted to give them a mention is because

41:32.560 --> 41:38.480
this is one of the most badass apps we have on desktop linux and i i i'm i'm very hopeful that

41:38.480 --> 41:43.280
crowdfunding can be a way for the open source community to fund these really standout applications

41:43.280 --> 41:48.960
and when you have a desktop linux application that not only has a good history but it has an

41:48.960 --> 41:55.360
ambitious target and has been delivering on a consistent basis i'm all about that so i wanted

41:55.360 --> 41:58.960
to give them a plug you can find a link to their kickstarter project or you can just go to kickstart.com

41:58.960 --> 42:04.160
and search for the krita project it's from the krita foundation they're trying to get to uh 15

42:04.160 --> 42:10.480
000 and they're at 2148 right now 73 backers with 29 days to go and they got all their goals

42:10.480 --> 42:15.600
outlined out there and stuff like that so good luck to them it's a really really good app um

42:15.600 --> 42:19.040
it's one of these apps that i kind of wish we had spent more time with on the linux action show

42:19.040 --> 42:23.680
demoing uh but i'm just so not skilled at this kind of stuff that it would be embarrassing right

42:23.680 --> 42:28.320
but if i was i would i would be showing this kind of stuff off so just give it a mention for one of

42:28.320 --> 42:33.200
our great desktop linux apps that's out there that you know this is this is one of the applications

42:33.200 --> 42:38.560
that any desktop environment proprietary or not would be proud to have definitely so there you go

42:38.560 --> 42:43.440
good work guys and good luck on the fundraiser they got a they got a video too that you can go

42:43.440 --> 42:48.480
catch with some catchy like uh you know kickstarter music and they got some green screen action going

42:48.480 --> 42:53.680
it's nice look at this green screen action they got going good work kickstarter videos is that you

42:53.680 --> 42:57.760
always want to like curl up with a cup of tea as you watch you know the whole thing i mean the

42:57.760 --> 43:01.120
whole kickstarter video thing you know that's like an industry now there's like people with their

43:01.120 --> 43:06.560
full-time business is uh recording kickstarter videos and indiegogo videos and stuff like that

43:06.560 --> 43:10.960
like the whole that's like their whole thing man that's what they do for a living that's crazy i

43:10.960 --> 43:14.480
mean if only we knew more people had that kind of equipment instead of thought of that i should have

43:14.480 --> 43:20.320
thought of that dang it all right well you guys can find links to all that stuff in the show notes

43:20.320 --> 43:25.120
also just a shout out uh two new shows over on jupiter broadcasting how to linux launched

43:25.120 --> 43:32.080
and episode one is out and uh tech talk today is daily monday through thursday episode six is out

43:32.080 --> 43:37.600
today we talked about netflix and verizon round two it's a pretty interesting spat that is directly

43:37.600 --> 43:42.320
related to all of the net neutrality stuff going on right now and has the potential to bust that

43:42.320 --> 43:46.400
stuff open so we've been covering that on tech talk today we've also covered the best from e3

43:46.400 --> 43:52.560
that's happened so far and you guys probably heard about that turing uh test that was supposedly

43:52.560 --> 43:57.920
beaten but not so much we bust that in today's episode of tech talk today and you can join us

43:57.920 --> 44:04.560
every day monday through thursday at jblive.tv 9 a.m pacific noon eastern and uh you know we

44:04.560 --> 44:09.120
have uh also we have the mumble room involved too so if you didn't get it if you don't get a chance
