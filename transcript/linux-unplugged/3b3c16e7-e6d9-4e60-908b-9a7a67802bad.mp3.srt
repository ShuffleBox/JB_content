1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,120
I was thinking about dropping the coming up

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,260
on this week's episode of Unplugged.

3
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:04,100
You know, I always like,

4
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,740
coming up on this week's episode of Unplugged.

5
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:06,580
The little pre-tease.

6
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,540
It just feels old.

7
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,540
You know, now that we got chapter markers and stuff,

8
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,820
like, I don't need to tell you what's coming up.

9
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,180
It's all right there.

10
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,020
Yeah.

11
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,180
You know, we now live in a post-chapter marker reality.

12
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,260
So I think I'm gonna drop it.

13
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,380
We'll see how it goes.

14
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:23,580
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 297 for April 16th, 2019.

15
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,580
Welcome into Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,880
that's gearing up for the big Ubuntu 19.04 release.

17
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,720
My name is Chris.

18
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,560
My name is Wes.

19
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,000
Hello, Wes.

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,820
So I'm not doing the whole coming up this week thing.

21
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,660
I'm not doing it anymore.

22
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,500
We're skipping it.

23
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,320
We're not skipping it anymore.

24
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,100
We're gonna get right into the content.

25
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,900
So to achieve that mission,

26
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,060
let's bring in our virtual lug.

27
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,700
Time-appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

28
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,540
Hello.

29
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,380
Hello.

30
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,200
Hello.

31
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,040
Hello.

32
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,880
Hello.

33
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,700
You want a lovely bunch.

34
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,540
Look at that.

35
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,360
Look at that over there.

36
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,200
We got Brent.

37
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,040
We got Elle.

38
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,260
We got Mimidus, Mini-Meg.

39
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,400
We got Neon Burner, which looks like Neon Burger

40
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,620
from where I'm at.

41
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:11,180
M. Mason's in there, Tech Mav, the project manager.

42
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,740
Turth and Wimpy in there, all repping our virtual lug.

43
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,740
And of course, joining us on a direct studio line

44
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,260
is the one, the only, Mr. Bacon.

45
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,080
Hello, cheese.

46
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,920
Hey, guys.

47
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,760
How's it going?

48
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,600
Everybody?

49
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,420
Everybody?

50
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,260
Pretty good.

51
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,620
I'm pretty excited today about Ubuntu 19.04.

52
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,940
Wes and I have been running it for quite a while

53
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,180
and have many thoughts to share.

54
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,880
And I have arrived somewhere

55
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,520
that I don't think any of you will expect.

56
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,600
I'm just gonna put it like that.

57
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,440
We'll just, we'll get there.

58
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,180
But what do you say we start with some community news?

59
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,020
We've got to.

60
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,220
We've got to, Wes,

61
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,460
because that's what we have lined up so far.

62
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,420
I thought maybe we'd do a couple like quick

63
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,160
like service announcements and then get in.

64
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,580
Normally we've been starting with birthdays,

65
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,180
but we're had a birthday, unless we missed one.

66
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,020
Did we miss one?

67
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:53,860
Raise your hand if so.

68
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,540
Is it, it's not anybody's birthday

69
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,820
in the mumble room, right?

70
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,580
Happy birthday again, Wes.

71
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,420
Yeah.

72
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,620
Thank you.

73
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,180
Yeah, there we go.

74
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,460
No, let's start with just a couple of bits of like,

75
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,580
this is gonna matter,

76
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,500
but not a lot of conversation needs to be had.

77
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,020
First up is Red Hat is announcing changes

78
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,920
to their certified engineer program.

79
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,240
Currently the RHCE is a Red Hat certified

80
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,660
system administrator, R-H-C-S-A,

81
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,460
geez, I have these acronyms.

82
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,340
This, Elle could explain this better than I could,

83
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,940
who possess additional skills, knowledge,

84
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,100
and abilities required in data center services.

85
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,340
In the updated program,

86
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,280
we are shifting the focus to automation of Linux systems,

87
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,900
like administration tasks using Red Hat Ansible Automation,

88
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,540
and we'll be changing the requirements

89
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,180
for achieving an RHCE credential.

90
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,020
Yeah, all right.

91
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,840
So in the next set of this stuff,

92
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,760
there's gonna be a new course and then a new exam.

93
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,940
So Red Hat System Administration 3, Linux Automation,

94
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,100
which is basically designed for Linux system administrators

95
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,300
and developers who need to automate provisioning,

96
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,300
configuration, application deployment, and orchestration.

97
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,540
Basically, you learn how to use Ansible.

98
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,580
It makes a lot of sense, right?

99
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,420
In the age of the cloud, in the age of automation,

100
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,300
data center knowledge is important,

101
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,260
but this seems to have maybe a wider scope.

102
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,260
To me, it feels like what Red Hat is saying here

103
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,660
is having a comprehensive understanding

104
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,260
of the automation tools is just as important

105
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,900
as having a comprehensive understanding

106
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,220
of the operating system.

107
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,180
That's the implicit statement.

108
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,220
That's a big statement.

109
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,060
It's true.

110
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,660
I mean, I think the market feels that way,

111
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,540
but it's Red Hat kind of updating

112
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,140
their really well-known industry programs to reflect that.

113
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,140
Yeah, well, I mean, you just have a lot of systems

114
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,860
that you probably have to take care of, right?

115
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,620
It's not about one Linux server or two in an HA pair.

116
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,460
It's about all the ones that you have

117
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,940
in various data centers and cloud programs.

118
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,140
While we're talking about big corporations using Linux,

119
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,420
this is kind of an interesting one

120
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,220
that folks have noticed on the Google I.O. schedule.

121
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:53,220
There is a Linux for Chromebooks secure development track.

122
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,460
Learn how Chrome OS gives you a secure, safe sandbox

123
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,300
for the web, Android, and Linux

124
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,500
through Chrome OS design principles.

125
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,860
Yeah, that's right.

126
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,180
Ah, ha-ha, this session will also cover ways

127
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,100
to handle challenges to high performance

128
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,580
and trade-offs with safety.

129
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,500
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

130
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,940
Well, that's something to watch.

131
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,660
So they're really going all in to position this thing

132
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,900
as a development platform.

133
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,500
I mean, they've slowly been piecing it together, right?

134
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,140
Every week, it seems like one little new piece

135
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,380
is added to Chromebook Linux app support.

136
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,780
Winby, I don't think I've heard your thoughts

137
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,500
on Google's moves here to clearly turn this thing

138
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,920
into kind of a Sputnik competitor.

139
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,940
Probably, I mean, yes, why not?

140
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,860
I mean, we saw from the OpenStack developer survey

141
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,700
that came out last week that there is 20-odd percent

142
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,220
of developers using Linux,

143
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,620
so wherever you can provide Linux to developers

144
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,660
is obviously going to be popular with developers, I think.

145
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,500
This is maybe my normal default reaction

146
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,500
for Google stuff like this,

147
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,220
but I am sitting a bit uneasy

148
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,700
after our conversation last week

149
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,060
about what makes desktop Linux, really.

150
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:00,900
Yep.

151
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,540
I'm less enthusiastic about this.

152
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,380
Yeah, I'm conflicted on this.

153
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,740
So we obviously had that conversation last week,

154
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,740
and there's a class of Linux devices

155
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,420
where you don't want to be able to do

156
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,060
all of those things that we described,

157
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,980
which is you express the ultimate flexibility

158
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,340
of the Linux desktop by being able to download,

159
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:28,620
compile, and boot off the kernel that you've just compiled.

160
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,220
That defines the true heritage

161
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,460
of Linux distributions in my mind.

162
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,780
However, if you're building IoT devices, for example,

163
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,020
you don't want to expose that kind of flexibility

164
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,460
to the device manufacturer, right?

165
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,380
You want to lock that stuff down and provide them

166
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:47,060
with a secure, updated environment.

167
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,900
And there's an argument to be made

168
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,340
for having a desktop environment

169
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,660
that kind of mimics that as well.

170
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,700
If you're only ever going

171
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,540
to be developing Android applications,

172
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,220
do you need all of the flexibility

173
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,020
that we see as an advantage?

174
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,620
Do you just need the ability

175
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,100
to install the development tools that you need

176
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,740
to create the development environment

177
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,660
that you need to get your job done

178
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,540
and then to go about the business

179
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,380
of creating Android apps or whatever it might be?

180
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,940
Does that type of developer actually need

181
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,500
all of the flexibility that we hold so dear?

182
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,660
Right, I mean, the same stuff when we talk

183
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,660
about the Windows subsystem for Linux, right?

184
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,540
And I think already too many developers,

185
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,020
Linux is a tool that you run on your servers, right?

186
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,140
You kind of view it as an environment

187
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,940
that I make for my application,

188
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,460
especially if it's going to be in some sort of container

189
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,940
or virtual machine.

190
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,460
So it's not necessarily the thing you play with

191
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,860
or are embedded in.

192
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,140
Yeah, so I'm being a little bit

193
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,460
of devil's advocate this week.

194
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,220
I'm playing the counter position.

195
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,060
The other thing is maybe it's just easy, right?

196
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,380
And then they're like, oh, this Linux stuff's

197
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,620
pretty handy and I like how it can do more stuff

198
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,380
than it can do in the outside application.

199
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,380
Maybe I should explore,

200
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,020
but that's going to be a tiny percentage realistically.

201
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,820
Once again, RMS was right.

202
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,540
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

203
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,660
He just deploys it as a container and good to go.

204
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:03,020
So there is some buzz around video

205
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,580
that the Linux, the Linux, oh my God, I'm that guy.

206
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,340
Oh my God, I'm that guy.

207
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,940
The Linus Link.

208
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,380
Juniper Broadcasting, is that it again?

209
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,420
I never really said it out loud.

210
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,540
The Linus Link Tech Show, is that what it's called?

211
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,260
Linus Link Tech Tips, that's what it is.

212
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,500
Linus Tech Tips.

213
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,340
Okay, okay.

214
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,180
LTT.

215
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,540
Yeah, and I do actually watch from time to time.

216
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,380
I don't know why I just,

217
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,340
I guess I've never had to say it out loud before.

218
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,340
There's a lot of buzz though around a video

219
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,820
that they did recently around gaming on Linux.

220
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:35,220
The title of the video is Microsoft should be very afraid.

221
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,660
A noob's guide to installing Linux gaming.

222
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,660
It's actually a pretty well done video,

223
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,580
which is a nice change of pace in general

224
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,260
for this kind of stuff.

225
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,620
But they really made a pretty good sales pitch

226
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,820
for both Manjaro and Pop!OS in there.

227
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,300
But I would say they really kind of sealed the deal

228
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,580
right here towards the end of the video.

229
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,940
For Pop!OS and Manjaro,

230
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,700
and actually for a number of other distros

231
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,220
we didn't cover today,

232
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,940
the steps basically boil down to install the OS,

233
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,260
install Steam or Lutris, and start playing.

234
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,300
That's what makes these distros

235
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,180
especially enticing for gamers.

236
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,500
But while Manjaro is set up well

237
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,340
to cater to gamers out of the box,

238
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,060
it's not going to be as stable as a distro like Ubuntu.

239
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,320
And that's why Pop!OS and others like it

240
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,500
try to bridge that gap with updated drivers

241
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,480
while still retaining excellent community support

242
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,800
and stable packages,

243
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,180
which makes them a good choice for getting your feet wet.

244
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,820
So Emma, I'm curious what System76

245
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,660
has seen as response to this video.

246
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:32,560
So we've had thousands of gigabytes of data downloaded.

247
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,500
We had, since then we've had 18,000,

248
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,620
almost 18,000 downloads of Pop!OS.

249
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,020
It's very exciting.

250
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,020
Are you seeing higher than average,

251
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,680
like people sticking around now

252
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,420
that the video has been out for a little bit?

253
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,560
Like are the downloads still remaining high?

254
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,500
Yes, we're seeing about 2,000 per day.

255
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,420
The first day was about 5,000,

256
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,740
and each day after has been 2,000 or more.

257
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,420
So.

258
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,900
Wow, congratulations.

259
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,740
That is an achievement right there.

260
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,580
That is fantastic.

261
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,060
And I think, you know,

262
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,580
overall, the last few months,

263
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,100
I've seen more and more people talking about Pop!OS,

264
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,660
using Pop!OS.

265
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,580
It's becoming more and more

266
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,300
of a well-established distribution.

267
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,300
Well, thank you.

268
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,540
You are almost enticing me, I have to admit.

269
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,540
Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, there's a lot of effort

270
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,060
that's been put in there to tune some things,

271
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,580
and I think people are talking about that,

272
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,820
and other people are picking it up,

273
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,820
and be like, oh, I want that.

274
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,460
Why doesn't my computer do it already?

275
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,860
Yeah, and I've heard rumors

276
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,140
that there'll be a new installer,

277
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,620
that the new installer will support CFS soon,

278
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,500
and things like that.

279
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,580
So there's other advantages

280
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,780
that start to make it appealing,

281
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,720
besides just a few other things,

282
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,860
like maybe a new theme,

283
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,440
or a different way to encrypt the hard drive.

284
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,980
But there's other things that have been coming along

285
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,100
that really seem like a pretty good innovation.

286
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,540
Or at least a nice value add,

287
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,460
in a case like this, easy access to Steam,

288
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,020
and what not, that got the attention

289
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,420
of the folks over at Linus Tech Tips,

290
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,260
and I got it.

291
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,080
Good job.

292
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,920
Thank you.

293
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,860
And I just, I'm really happy to hear

294
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,940
that you guys have gotten some traffic from it,

295
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,440
and I'd be curious to know

296
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,980
what the Manjaro project has seen,

297
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,860
because the Manjaro got a fair amount of mentions.

298
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,380
They lean Pop OS, though, towards the end,

299
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,700
and I think for good reason,

300
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,820
especially for the type of user.

301
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,000
Yeah, for the video that this,

302
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,080
and the audience they're aiming for,

303
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,620
that's probably the best advice.

304
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,100
But the title, Microsoft should be very worried,

305
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,620
all uppercase, very, very worried.

306
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,940
That's pretty good.

307
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,780
That's pretty good.

308
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,600
Pretty, pretty good.

309
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,960
So that's cool to hear, Emma.

310
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,800
That's really cool to hear

311
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,100
that you got some downloads from it.

312
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,860
Hello, Mr. Popey, I see you sneaking in there

313
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,700
under the wire.

314
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,780
Oh, hello.

315
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,580
How are you doing, sir?

316
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,420
I'm good, thank you.

317
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,620
It's like when you sneak into class,

318
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,400
and then the teacher calls you out for sneaking in.

319
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,620
I saw you see me out the corner of your eye, but yeah.

320
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,700
I know you were just getting back

321
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,540
from the DevWan conference,

322
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,260
and so I just wanted to get your report

323
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:54,440
at the first ever DevWan conference, and how it went.

324
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,740
Wait, what?

325
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,660
Oh, I thought you'd just go with it.

326
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,620
Oh man, I actually feel a little bad

327
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,740
about giving these guys such a hard time.

328
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,660
At least I did until I read this blog post.

329
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,240
But before I read this blog post,

330
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,780
I was starting to feel like maybe I should go easy.

331
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,860
Like they've actually got some genuine.

332
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,940
I mean, it's not like it's a problem.

333
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,220
They're not hurting anyone by.

334
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,500
And they're finding a market.

335
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,340
And they're, you know.

336
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,880
If there are users and people who are happy to develop

337
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,980
and use the operating system,

338
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,140
then all the better for them to do so.

339
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,060
It starts out, the blog post starts out pretty good.

340
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,940
It starts, the conference took place in Amsterdam

341
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,340
in one of the rooms of a building

342
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,940
that is floating on the water,

343
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,780
and looks a lot like an anchored submarine.

344
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,700
This white submarine gives us home

345
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,580
to offices of dyne.org, D-Y-N-E.org,

346
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,900
a nonprofit foundation dedicated to free software,

347
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,020
art, and sustainability.

348
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,380
All right, okay, they got some pictures of food.

349
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,800
They say each day was filled

350
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,380
with lots of interesting speakers

351
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,340
and intermittent hack sessions

352
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,880
where participants got the chance to exchange ideas,

353
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,740
share knowledge, and plan future steps

354
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,700
regarding their role in the open source community.

355
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,180
But things kind of take a turn to the left

356
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,540
or to the right, however you, I don't know.

357
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,580
They just take a turn for the worse.

358
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,380
They go down a different route, Wes.

359
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,140
It starts around here.

360
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,540
There was an omnipresent feeling

361
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,280
that the people attending the conference

362
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,860
were superheroes finally being able to put on their suits.

363
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,260
That's one of many things that are in this post

364
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,220
that are very, very hyperbolic.

365
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,100
Now, I get what they're going for.

366
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,180
I get what they're going for,

367
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,740
but it starts to really kind of go off the rails

368
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,580
in the language here,

369
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,020
and I think this is why I originally gave them

370
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,900
such a hard time is the way they say things.

371
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,820
Yeah, I like this.

372
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,840
The submarine-looking building gave home

373
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,220
to an event gathering open source superheroes

374
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,240
and all sorts of magical creatures

375
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,340
because to quote the first Dev1 docs print,

376
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,500
software freedom your way.

377
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,180
We must apply thought and attention to software development.

378
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,500
We share responsibility as users and developers

379
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,300
of software systems to foster values of cooperation

380
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,340
in the spirit of science, human cultures,

381
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,140
and the diversity of life.

382
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,380
That's pretty bold.

383
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,780
They got a mission there.

384
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,420
They're a project with a mission.

385
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,060
I can't really argue with any of that though.

386
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,340
I mean, they really grandiose in the way they talk,

387
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,220
and if you're gonna do something like this,

388
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,260
if you're gonna fork Debian

389
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,500
and make a system-D free version of Debian,

390
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,380
you've really gotta have some fundamental beliefs

391
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,500
to be willing to put yourself

392
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,020
through that kind of hell and torture.

393
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,860
I will also say whatever salad that they're having there

394
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,700
looks delicious.

395
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,940
Yeah, I see a lot of cilantro.

396
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,260
I think it's like a nacho thing, Wes.

397
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,220
I don't know if it's a salad.

398
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,700
Cause look at that melted, that's melted cheese, right?

399
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,740
Oh, okay.

400
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,820
Yeah, I think it's a salad.

401
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,700
Look, then they got the plates with the cilantro on them.

402
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,660
They're really big on the cilantro over there apparently.

403
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,540
I'm down with that.

404
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,660
Yeah, I don't mind a little cilantro.

405
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:41,660
So speaking of ZFS, it appears that work is in way

406
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,780
for Ubuntu 20.04-ish.

407
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,660
And gentlemen, correct me if you know anything differently.

408
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,020
Michael over at Ferronix writes

409
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:52,380
that the ZFS undertaking is a huge effort.

410
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,500
And we really haven't heard much about it.

411
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,860
Although I was actually sniffing around

412
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,100
and I did see some status updates

413
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,300
about like testing and restoring stuff.

414
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,000
So there is actual work underway.

415
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,900
And it looks like it'll probably land

416
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:09,660
for the user installer in 20.04, the LTS for next year.

417
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,140
Feels far away, but really,

418
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:14,180
it's not that far and there's a lot to get right here

419
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,300
and you don't wanna mess it up.

420
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,140
Yeah.

421
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:21,140
Well, I've seen some stuff at company sprints,

422
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,980
but I'm not sure if we're gonna land this for 20.04.

423
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,900
Really?

424
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,700
I'll have to go away and confer with my colleagues

425
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,860
to be absolutely certain,

426
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,820
but I think this is due to land after 20.04.

427
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,900
Now the ZFS stuff or something else like a new installer?

428
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,500
Both of those things, I believe.

429
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,380
I see, okay.

430
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,220
But the work has already started

431
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,460
and I've definitely seen some prototypes working

432
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,180
and I don't wanna give too much away,

433
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,220
but there's some very interesting strategies

434
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,560
that are being used to deploy this and it's pretty nifty.

435
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,500
I will say that the time it takes to install

436
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,860
is radically reduced using this mechanism.

437
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,860
It's pretty impressive.

438
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:03,140
Ooh, okay, now I'm properly teased.

439
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,460
I also wanted to give a little plug skis

440
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,660
to TechSnap, TechSnap.Systems slash 401.

441
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,060
Wes and Jim did everyday ZFS,

442
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:13,300
just really, really good information about ZFS,

443
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,180
especially for everyday use cases.

444
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,140
Busted some myths,

445
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,900
covered some of the license and legality stuff.

446
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,700
You know, Jim just lives and breathes ZFS

447
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,020
and it's kind of a TechSnap tradition,

448
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,260
so I thought we should have our take on it.

449
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,520
I was gonna say that.

450
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,700
It is a TechSnap tradition, so yeah.

451
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,060
TechSnap.Systems slash 401.

452
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,180
If you want that, I enjoyed it.

453
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,020
I enjoyed it.

454
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:32,840
I did too.

455
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,420
Yep, you guys make a good team.

456
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,140
I miss doing the show, but you guys make a good team.

457
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,660
Well, that's the community news.

458
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,620
Pretty brief today.

459
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,500
Pretty brief today, so I think we should move on.

460
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,860
Move on with the rest of the show.

461
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,700
Let's get into a little housekeeping.

462
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,260
And for fun, I'm gonna do it

463
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,380
with a little music this week.

464
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,220
Yeah?

465
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,620
Yeah, just to kind of keep it going.

466
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,460
Just to kind of keep going.

467
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,280
Keep our house clean.

468
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,020
We do have a couple of things to talk about

469
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,380
in the housekeeping this week.

470
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,220
Yeah, get out, get it tidy.

471
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,440
First of all, big, big deal.

472
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,900
Linux Academy is doing a 299-year promo right now.

473
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,140
It's a 33% discount.

474
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:06,980
That's great.

475
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,820
Go take advantage of that

476
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,620
by going to linuxacademy.com and sign up.

477
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,300
It's in effect for about a week or two.

478
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,140
I don't know.

479
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,180
It started yesterday, and it's a limited time offer,

480
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,020
so go check it out.

481
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,340
Divide that by 12, and you'll be like,

482
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,700
okay, yeah, that's a good deal.

483
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,540
Very good deal.

484
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,500
Plus, they're launching a bunch of content right now too.

485
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,940
Now, Friday, Friday on the jblive.tv stream,

486
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,300
we're doing a little hangout.

487
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,580
We'll be doing it at 2 p.m.

488
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,920
Jupiter Broadcasting Time, that's specific.

489
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,220
You can get it converted to your local time

490
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,600
at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

491
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,460
Just hanging out.

492
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,340
We wanted to do some community interaction stuff.

493
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,820
We'll do a week in review.

494
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,940
We'll review some of the show clips,

495
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,900
expand on a little further, hang out, chat with the crew.

496
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,140
We're gonna try to have a lot

497
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,740
of the Jupiter Broadcasting crew participate as they can.

498
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,900
Just a little hangout session, jblive.tv,

499
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,980
2 p.m. Pacific this Friday, and hopefully next Friday,

500
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,420
when we'll have people in town.

501
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,380
Oh, yeah.

502
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,060
People in town can stop by while they're in studio

503
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,780
and hang out with us on the Friday stream.

504
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,540
Always a good time to join live, join the IRC room too.

505
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,820
Totes.

506
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,140
Speaking of Linux Fest.

507
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,260
Oh, it's coming up.

508
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,380
Yeah, and if you're coming and you're gonna hang out

509
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,820
at our Linux Fest parking lot barbecue,

510
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:14,340
if you're driving, consider bringing your own chair, please.

511
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,220
We'll have some chairs,

512
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,540
especially for those of you who are flying in,

513
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,660
because I can't expect you to bring a chair on the airplane.

514
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,540
But if you're flying up and you have the room,

515
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,020
you might bring a camping chair too with you.

516
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,020
Everybody likes to sit, right?

517
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:26,860
Everybody likes to sit.

518
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:29,860
And last but not least, very awesome,

519
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,660
our community is self-organizing

520
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,860
in the Linux Fest Telegram group right now

521
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,140
for carpools from the airport.

522
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,860
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Linux Fest.

523
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,060
Angela has made a spreadsheet

524
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,460
that people can put their names in

525
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,900
and time of arrival and all that date stuff.

526
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,300
And then people can organize and give each other rides.

527
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,780
That's happening right now in our Telegram group.

528
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,940
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Linux Fest.

529
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:56,300
And last but not least, Mr. Bacon's here with the job report.

530
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,660
We got a special community job posting, don't we?

531
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,500
Yes, we do.

532
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,540
We had one of our community members, Jacob,

533
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:06,380
reach out to me this last week on our Telegram,

534
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,460
which you can find a link to that

535
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,060
if you go to Jupiterbroadcasting.com.

536
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,060
Up at the top, you'll see a Telegram icon.

537
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,540
Click on that and you can join us.

538
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,060
But he works for a company called Simplot.

539
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,820
They're an agriculture company.

540
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,460
So they do a lot of work with farmers and such.

541
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,620
They're currently looking for

542
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,580
an infrastructure engineer three

543
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:32,780
to work in their Boise, Idaho office.

544
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,340
They go in to talking about what you'll need to do.

545
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:40,060
And we'll have this link posted in the show notes.

546
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:44,060
But you'll provide rock-solid platforms to run workloads

547
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,780
such as MySQL, Apache, WebLogic, Tomcat,

548
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,260
HANA, Docker, OpenShift, Hadoop.

549
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,300
All those things, obviously,

550
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,100
you can get training for on Linux Academy.

551
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,580
Maybe we have some Linux Academy students out there

552
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,460
that might be interested.

553
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,740
This would be a good place to apply.

554
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,180
I've talked to Jacob and he said that the team

555
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,740
is a really awesome team to work with.

556
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:06,540
So if you're looking for a job, this might be for you.

557
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,420
There you go.

558
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,580
Combining farming and Linux together.

559
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,420
Amazing.

560
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,260
That'd be pretty good.

561
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,340
We'll have a link in the show notes.

562
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,820
Go check that out.

563
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,500
Thank you, Mr. Bacon, for the job report there.

564
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,060
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the housekeeping.

565
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:19,900
See, we got through it.

566
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,900
Good job, everybody.

567
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,980
Got through that pretty fast, actually.

568
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,980
I'm so proud of us.

569
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,100
I felt good.

570
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,020
That felt really good.

571
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:25,860
All right.

572
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,060
Well, I think this is why we're all

573
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,020
kind of in a rush today.

574
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,860
This is what we're really-

575
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,700
There's a lot to chew on.

576
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,700
This is what we're here for today.

577
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,700
Very, very much, very much so.

578
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:39,140
Looking forward to talking about Ubuntu 19.04, disco, dingo.

579
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:44,140
Everybody's doing disco, disco, disco, disco, disco, disco.

580
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:51,620
The new 19.04 release is a really big deal

581
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,180
for a non-LTS release.

582
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:56,580
In fact, I'd argue it's one of the bigger deals

583
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,860
for a non-LTS release in years.

584
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,900
In fact, even bigger than 17.10 was,

585
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,740
which was the first version that switched to GNOME.

586
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,380
And to give us some context,

587
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,180
while I feel this is sort of a big deal,

588
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,620
is I want to go back in time for a moment.

589
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:15,380
Let's go back almost two years right on the nose

590
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,940
when Noah and I were standing at Dell headquarters

591
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:22,540
covering the news that Canonical was dropping Unity.

592
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:26,180
So Mark Shuttleworth just sort of changed

593
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,100
the Linux landscape in a big way.

594
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,060
And I say that once we get into it,

595
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,120
I think you'll understand why I say that.

596
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,940
But what was announced was that Canonical,

597
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,940
starting with, was it 18.04?

598
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,080
Right, next LTS.

599
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,980
The next LTS, they're going to switch to GNOME by default.

600
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:47,980
And they will be de-investing efforts into Unity 8.

601
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,860
They will be sunsetting Unity 7.

602
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,740
They will be shipping GNOME by default

603
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,500
on the next LTS Ubuntu.

604
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,700
And the ramifications of that are ginormous.

605
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,820
There's a personnel ramification within Canonical.

606
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,580
And we actually ended up seeing shipping before 18.04.

607
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,080
It ended up shipping in one of the point releases

608
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,920
ahead of time.

609
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,180
And I think it is unquestionable that it has really,

610
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,200
it has really changed the Linux desktop

611
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,540
in the last couple of years.

612
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,220
It has been a couple of wild rides.

613
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,700
And while why I believe 19.04 is a bigger deal

614
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,260
than your average bear,

615
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,260
is because it is truly the release

616
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:26,260
that is the full net result of this new focus.

617
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,060
17.10 was the first go.

618
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,180
18.04 was a stable shot at it.

619
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,980
You know, let's make sure we're conservative here.

620
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,980
There's a lot to consider for an LTS release.

621
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,100
So this, you know, one more past that and...

622
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,620
And now with 19.04, you've got GNOME 3.32.

623
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:45,780
You've got Mesa 19.0, Linux kernel 5.0,

624
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,860
and the new default Yaru theme,

625
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,420
which gives it its own unique look again.

626
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:56,420
So Ubuntu looks modern, but unique again, and still.

627
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,480
And so I think it was these reasons perhaps

628
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,660
that you and I were,

629
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,080
I guess it wasn't just these reasons,

630
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,460
but it's these reasons amongst also all of the work

631
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,940
that's gone into GNOME Shell by Canonical,

632
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,540
by Red Hat employees, by Endless,

633
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:15,940
that have really made it much, much more performant.

634
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,980
And we had been watching the development of that,

635
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,260
you and I were like, we've got to try this.

636
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,580
There's just so much going on.

637
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,980
It kept feeling like it kept getting better and better.

638
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,420
Yeah, and we've been on Plasma at that point

639
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,540
for nearly a year.

640
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,820
A long time, yeah.

641
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,020
Almost, yeah.

642
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,380
And at least for me, yeah.

643
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,060
And nearly a year for you.

644
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,180
And it was just kind of time to like dip our toe

645
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,500
in the GNOME world again and see,

646
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,860
okay, how does 3.32 really shake up?

647
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,300
Like, is it better?

648
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,800
And you could just instantly,

649
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,700
instantly within moments of logging in,

650
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,540
notice a performance difference.

651
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,960
Animations were clearly smoother.

652
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,620
They just felt snappier.

653
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,260
Most of it is the things that you don't see.

654
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,460
It just is snappy.

655
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,620
Things happen quickly.

656
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,820
It's almost like there's the Joe style,

657
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,140
no transitions anywhere effect.

658
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,380
Yeah, and I thought, okay,

659
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:06,940
well, let's give it a go on Fedora Rawhide, right?

660
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,740
Because that's supposed to be a real GNOME showcase.

661
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,900
So let's give it a go over there

662
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,180
and see what 3.32 is like on Rawhide.

663
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,220
And it was pretty great.

664
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,900
It was quite great, actually.

665
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,700
Yeah, I remember you telling me that you were doing that.

666
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,140
Honestly, I know you, I know how much you like Fedora.

667
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,060
I expected you to be sitting out there

668
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,060
on Fedora for a while.

669
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,820
I did too.

670
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,080
But I will say this,

671
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:31,020
there are a few vendor modifications to the GNOME shell

672
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,540
that Canonical makes,

673
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:36,860
the combination of their doc and the Yaru theme

674
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,500
and the performance fixes that I think they've implemented

675
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,480
that aren't necessarily on Fedora yet,

676
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,440
kind of came together to make the GNOME 19.04 experience

677
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,440
superior, in my opinion.

678
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,960
And after running Rawhide for a couple of weeks,

679
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,040
I switched back to 19.04 and just went all in.

680
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:57,520
And I found the performance to be noticeably better.

681
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,680
Wow, and that is impressive.

682
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,920
It's funny to think about that we had two years ago

683
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,080
when we were first talking about this,

684
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,120
we were kind of wondering about what the future investments

685
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,160
of Canonical into the desktop might be, right?

686
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,480
Switching to GNOME, was this just gonna be,

687
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,280
we were like, is this gonna be a stock GNOME

688
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,400
or are we really gonna see something

689
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,800
that feels like Ubuntu?

690
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,240
And I think now we can say, we can answer that.

691
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,560
Yeah, in fact, going back in time again, two years,

692
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,000
you and Noah were sitting here on this very show

693
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,160
while I was driving up from Dell.

694
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,320
You lazy schmuck.

695
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,400
And we're pontificating on what this might mean

696
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,320
for future Linux users.

697
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,080
I think that it's gonna be a really great thing

698
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,840
for Linux as a whole to have the biggest manufacturers

699
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,400
of the desktop Linux operating system,

700
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,160
that being Red Hat and Canonical,

701
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,920
both of them working together

702
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,680
to form a single desktop environment.

703
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,240
And I think it's gonna be really good for the end users

704
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,520
because they're gonna have more freedom

705
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,040
to go from one to store the other

706
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,600
and it's all gonna look the same because,

707
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,960
hey, they're starting with GNOME.

708
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,440
And this idea that we'd see some real improvements

709
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,000
with everybody focusing on one desktop environment

710
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,560
was theoretical at the time.

711
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,800
But here we are two years later

712
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,640
and it's clearly had some great improvements for GNOME.

713
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,080
It's not 100% yet.

714
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,720
It has still crashed on me.

715
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,200
I'm gonna say, you've spent quite some time

716
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,080
on this here show talking about some of the problems

717
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,920
with GNOME.

718
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,680
And you had some shell crashes in 1904 as well.

719
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,520
Yeah, admittedly, I was kind of pushing things

720
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,360
to its limits.

721
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,320
I might keep Plasma as my audio workstation.

722
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,320
But the rest of the time, it was super pleasant.

723
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,200
And kind of, I might prefer that, honestly.

724
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,160
I might just like GNOME as everyday browsing.

725
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,520
It's kind of perfect for just, you know,

726
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,760
maybe a terminal, a couple of electron apps

727
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,600
and a web browser.

728
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,840
Where it doesn't need to be a mission critical workstation.

729
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,680
Mm-hmm.

730
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,520
It's not bad.

731
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,360
Not at all.

732
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,880
No, I really, it's snappy, it's easy, it's very intuitive.

733
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:48,120
And I like that I can just mostly, especially on 1904,

734
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,200
I can run the default.

735
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,200
I don't need to spend that sort of Plasma investment time

736
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,040
of tuning everything.

737
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:53,880
Right.

738
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,720
It just works.

739
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,360
I gotta give you a ding on that.

740
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,560
Because that is a big differentiator.

741
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,120
I just got right to work.

742
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:00,960
I really did.

743
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,000
I think I installed one or two extra extensions.

744
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,880
I like having the ping indicator up in my thing.

745
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,720
Yeah, that's right.

746
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,640
I like that.

747
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,360
And that might have been it.

748
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,360
That might have been it.

749
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,200
Yeah.

750
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,600
And I was good to go.

751
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,040
But 1904 isn't just the default release.

752
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,320
It is a ecosystem of flavors.

753
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,760
And I kind of wanted to turn it over to the mobile room

754
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,200
and talk with Mr. Popey and Mr. Wimpy about their thoughts

755
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,160
on the 1904 release.

756
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,440
Mr. Popey, I'll start with you.

757
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,640
Are you even trying out the betas anymore?

758
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,760
Or are you just sticking on 1804?

759
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,080
I was so excited about the performance improvements

760
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,480
in 1904 and other UX improvements.

761
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,720
I might get an opportunity to mention

762
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,480
that I upgraded two of my machines.

763
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,720
I've got a ThinkPad X220 and an Entroware Athena,

764
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,000
which is quite a beefy machine.

765
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,320
So I've got two ends of the scale,

766
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,600
one with an Nvidia GPU, one with an Intel GPU.

767
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,560
So I wanted to be able to see how this thing performs

768
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,720
on different chipsets at different ends of the scale.

769
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,560
And I love it.

770
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,400
It's really great.

771
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,080
It's so much better.

772
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,920
And I feel fine upgrading away from an LTS.

773
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,560
I'm usually the kind of person who sticks on LTSs.

774
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,120
On those two machines, I've moved.

775
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,360
That's the ultimate benchmark.

776
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,840
In fact, I want to come back to that very question

777
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,800
here in a second.

778
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,560
But you said two things I'd like to circle back to.

779
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,920
Number one, I'm curious to know what the performance

780
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,040
difference is like on Intel versus Nvidia.

781
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,600
And then I'm also curious what those other UI improvements

782
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,840
are that drew you in.

783
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,800
So I don't notice, really, a lot of difference

784
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,440
between the Intel laptop.

785
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,360
And it's a few years old.

786
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,000
It's like a 2012 Sandy Bridge i7.

787
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,640
So I mean, it's not a slouch.

788
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,920
But still, it's an Intel GPU.

789
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,200
And it's not a top-end brand new one.

790
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,400
And the Nvidia GPU is a 960 mobile device,

791
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,360
which is relatively common.

792
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,840
And it's, again, not the top of the range.

793
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,720
I'm not wimpy with 1070 Ti's coming out the wazoo.

794
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,680
1070?

795
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,680
I'm not a peasant.

796
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,040
Triggered.

797
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:06,600
Oh, man.

798
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:13,240
But the performance is comparable across them.

799
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,480
It's just the same.

800
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,720
It's the applications that are the problem now.

801
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,800
The shell isn't the problem anymore.

802
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,760
It's all these big fat applications

803
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,760
I'm running on top of them.

804
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,240
Sure.

805
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,320
And were there other?

806
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,360
You said there was some UI improvements, too.

807
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,840
Yeah, I've personally complained.

808
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,960
And I know many of our users did about some

809
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,320
of the UX of application switching

810
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,360
and the way the shell does application switching.

811
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,120
The alt tab and alt.

812
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,600
What's that key above tab?

813
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,840
In Unity land, we used to call it the key above tab.

814
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,560
Yeah, it's tilde, but it's not on a Mac.

815
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,040
It's grave.

816
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,120
Yeah, but it's not a grave.

817
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,120
It's a key above tab.

818
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,120
Oh, god.

819
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,520
It's, sorry.

820
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,520
But the improvements to the way switching windows

821
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,200
is massive for me because I often

822
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,800
have multiple windows for each application open.

823
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,240
And what I hate is alt tabbing between two applications

824
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,560
and being punched in the face by lots of windows

825
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,360
coming to the front.

826
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,480
I only want one of them.

827
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,840
And having to do a dance with multiple alt tab and alt grave

828
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,920
is just bizarre.

829
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,000
So we fixed that in 1904.

830
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,080
The desktop team fixed that in 1904.

831
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,800
I'll admit to being confused at first

832
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,800
because I got pretty used to the old admittedly

833
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,880
unintuitive method.

834
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,800
Yeah, yeah, totally.

835
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,160
And the sound panel is easy to use.

836
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,320
So it's a lot more intuitive.

837
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,120
Oh, I just love the new system preferences.

838
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,240
It's gotten so much better since I've used GNOME.

839
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,200
Yeah, GNOME upstream have done a really good job

840
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,200
with the redesign of the setting stuff.

841
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,760
And we're consuming that pretty much as it is.

842
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,480
It's great.

843
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,520
Now, what about you, Mr. Wimpy?

844
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,280
What are your thoughts on the 1904 release,

845
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,120
both from a Maté standpoint, but also just what

846
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,320
you hear around town?

847
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,000
Well, there's obviously, being a flavor,

848
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,280
there's obviously a number of advantages

849
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,520
that you get to inherit just by being based on top of Ubuntu.

850
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,000
So there's a couple of subtle things this time

851
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,240
around that are probably worth pointing out

852
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,000
that you might not notice unless you had it explained to you.

853
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,320
So everyone may have heard of or be familiar with WPA supplicant,

854
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,000
which is a tool to manage your Wi-Fi.

855
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,920
Yeah.

856
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:28,720
And the new hotness, maybe, is a tool called IWD.

857
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,840
So in Network Manager in this release,

858
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,360
you can optionally choose to use IWD

859
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:39,080
to manage your network authentication, which is good.

860
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,200
And that could well be a default in the future,

861
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,440
and that's one of the reasons why it's here for playing

862
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,200
and testing with.

863
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,920
And then a simple thing.

864
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,240
In the Boot Manager these days, you'll

865
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,200
find the Safe Graphics mode.

866
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,200
So for all of the different boot options,

867
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,120
you'll find a duplicate entry which says Safe Graphics Mode,

868
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,000
and that automatically sets no mode set.

869
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,320
And anyone not familiar with what that does,

870
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,600
that effectively sidesteps the DRM driver modules.

871
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,640
So if you have a GPU which is not well supported

872
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,200
by your kernel by default, you can

873
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,080
use that to get installed using a basic frame buffer

874
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,600
and then install your drivers after the fact

875
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,680
to get a working system.

876
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:25,120
And that's a small thing, but it's a nice little change.

877
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,200
So that's something that all of the flavors

878
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,760
get to benefit from.

879
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,600
In terms of Ubuntu MATE itself, it's

880
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,560
a bit of a dull release for us.

881
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,680
It's just bug fixes and finessing,

882
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,960
one of the reasons being I work alongside the Debian packaging

883
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,440
team.

884
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,800
They've got a release coming up.

885
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,960
Debian 10 is just around the corner,

886
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,240
and I've been doing all of the package

887
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,480
uplifts for MATE in Debian.

888
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,080
So we kind of put things on hiatus

889
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,360
because we've done this in the past

890
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,840
and made a right Horlicks of it where

891
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,000
we get this split of the versions of MATE in Debian

892
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,520
and the versions of MATE in Ubuntu,

893
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,960
and it all becomes a big pickle that we have to sort out.

894
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:10,160
So I've stuck alongside the Debian versions that are going

895
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,760
to be in Debian Buster.

896
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,520
I've committed all of my changes to Debian Git

897
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,360
last week for the new version of MATE,

898
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,400
including all of the fixes we needed

899
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,000
to do on some third party modules to get that stable.

900
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,880
So when we enter the 19.10 release,

901
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,880
we'll hit the ground running with MATE 1.22 from day one.

902
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,320
Now, I've been testing all of the flavors,

903
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,200
and I would just like to put a little hat tip out there

904
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,440
to the Ubuntu budget team.

905
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,660
That is a really, really nice implementation.

906
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,920
I was seriously impressed.

907
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,560
Yeah.

908
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,200
A great way to have a modern desktop

909
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,680
and run some GTK applications without using Home Shell.

910
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,800
Completely agree.

911
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,600
It's terrific.

912
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,640
It's really, really good.

913
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,440
I mean, it's been a while since I used it.

914
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,860
I think I last installed the 18.04 version, which was good,

915
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:03,560
but this version seems really bob on, really good.

916
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,920
So well done to the guys over there.

917
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,920
Congratulations on a fine release.

918
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,720
You should be very proud of yourselves.

919
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:16,480
You know, I'll also give a shout out to the Ubuntu release.

920
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,400
So I obviously spent the vast, vast majority

921
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,160
of my time on the Gnome Shell implementation of 19.04.

922
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:28,920
However, I have found it to be, it being Gnome Shell,

923
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:34,600
to be particularly challenging when I go beyond two monitors.

924
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,400
When I get into three and four monitors

925
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:41,240
that are like a DisplayPort over USB-C specifically, yeah.

926
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,160
That sounds complicated.

927
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:42,660
Right.

928
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,800
And so I grant you, it shouldn't be perfect, right?

929
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,000
I mean, it should be, but I understand why it's not.

930
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,120
But you like working.

931
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,960
Gnome Shell really kind of gets sporadic

932
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,340
about what monitor it's going to turn on when I boot up

933
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,760
and which ones don't get activated

934
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,160
and what orientate, because some of them are vertical.

935
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,660
And so what orientation is the screen?

936
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,640
And all of that basically changes every time I boot.

937
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,600
I never know what I'm going to get.

938
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,360
And maybe there's a method to the madness,

939
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,440
but I can't figure it out.

940
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,940
So after getting my feet fully wet on Gnome Shell

941
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:14,760
and really enjoying it, I think my inner Joe came out.

942
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,880
Everyone has one.

943
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:20,720
And I ended up installing the Zubuntu 1904 desktop.

944
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,920
And I have to say.

945
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:25,260
I'm kind of imagining you clicking over to the download

946
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:28,120
page and sneakily not admitting it to yourself

947
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,280
as you click the Download ISO button and install it.

948
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,880
I haven't even told you.

949
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,120
How could I?

950
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,720
He knew he was right this entire time.

951
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,760
That's amazing.

952
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,640
I have to say, it is extremely pleasant.

953
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,320
It is wicked fast.

954
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,820
It uses a tiny amount of resources.

955
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,360
All these things don't really matter.

956
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,760
I mean, that wicked fast matters.

957
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,080
But the resources, not as much, but it matters.

958
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,920
And yeah, there's things about it that are old school.

959
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,320
Like setting up my panel feels old school and stuff like that.

960
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,840
But once I have it set, man, like if it isn't just

961
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,600
set it and forget it and then just use your computer.

962
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,040
And just it's everything I got out of Gnome Shell,

963
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,080
but just straightforward and simpler.

964
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:14,160
And I really feel like it's a great recording workstation

965
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,880
desktop or a great workstation desktop.

966
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,920
I will very much be considering just switching my desktops

967
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,160
over to Xubuntu.

968
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,080
I mean, it makes sense.

969
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,000
It's been around.

970
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,960
Nothing needs to have changed except there's just

971
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,840
made steady improvements.

972
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,360
Now the question is, are there, and maybe Wimpy,

973
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,720
maybe you have an answer to this,

974
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,520
are there as many compelling reasons for me

975
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,920
to use 19.04 if I'm using Xubuntu?

976
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,080
Or should I just stay on 18.04 and use Xubuntu?

977
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,600
Because I don't think the XFCEs, I mean,

978
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,680
I didn't really check.

979
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,040
I mean, it feels like with XFCE it doesn't really matter.

980
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,800
It's, I just, I feel like it'd be the same XFCE regardless.

981
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,960
I think you're doing a little bit of a disservice to XFCE.

982
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,040
I know they are making the sort of steady march

983
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,480
to GTK3 only future.

984
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,880
And more of the component technologies

985
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,480
that make up their desktop offering

986
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,680
have been moved over to GTK3.

987
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,920
So that work is ongoing.

988
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,520
So and there's, if you follow Simon's blog,

989
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,480
this is a different Simon to Simon Quigley, obviously,

990
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,920
you will find that there's regular updates

991
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,720
on the improvements and new features

992
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,760
that they're adding to their suite of applications.

993
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,920
So, you know, they're going about their business

994
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,960
very methodically.

995
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,800
Yeah.

996
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,760
And not upsetting, you know, the Apple Car

997
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,920
in terms of, you know, how it looks and behaves.

998
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,840
You know, it's, I think Joe said, you know,

999
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:38,240
it was a comfortingly familiar when he installed 19.04.

1000
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,520
It is truly a fantastic power user experience.

1001
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,000
It is so simple, it is so straightforward.

1002
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,440
In fact, not even for power users,

1003
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,760
but just all the things I appreciate about a desktop,

1004
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,600
it is that.

1005
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,560
And no one complains that there are moving features.

1006
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,360
I was very, very, very, very impressed.

1007
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,860
So that brings me to the question

1008
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,600
that Popey alluded to earlier.

1009
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:01,600
Is it worth switching from an LTS 18.04 to 19.04

1010
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,160
and getting back on that upgrade train

1011
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,800
where you have to upgrade every so often?

1012
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,480
And I'm wondering what your take is, Wes,

1013
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,240
is it worth switching out, say, your laptop here,

1014
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:17,020
which has Kubuntu on it right now, 18.04,

1015
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:20,120
would you consider replacing that with 19.04?

1016
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:20,960
Yeah, absolutely.

1017
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,220
I mean, for my personal workstations,

1018
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,160
at least for ones that I touch every day,

1019
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,040
let's say, or nearly every day, that's reasonable.

1020
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,380
It's like a reasonable amount of work.

1021
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,520
It serves as a good, you know,

1022
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,480
good making sure that I have documentation

1023
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,460
about everything that I know and need to install

1024
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,280
on a workstation that I'm using.

1025
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,880
And especially in the case, you know,

1026
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,360
this time around with the GNOME improvements,

1027
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,920
I like having up-to-date packages.

1028
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,120
I used Arch for a long time.

1029
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,480
I've been using Ubuntu more recently,

1030
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,080
but I'm still that same Wes.

1031
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,680
It is just getting to that age where it's like,

1032
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,520
I could use a couple of packages.

1033
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,080
Now, you do have to balance that, right?

1034
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,220
Like, especially if you have like maybe a lot of PPAs

1035
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,600
that you have to wait to tell,

1036
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,680
they've got packages supported now with snaps

1037
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,180
and other systems that's less relevant,

1038
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,760
but it's still relevant to me.

1039
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,040
Yeah, the PPAs are the only pain point.

1040
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,160
Thank goodness there's so many workarounds around that now.

1041
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,320
That's my line too, the line you just drew right there.

1042
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,880
It's like, if it's my daily driver

1043
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,520
and I'm on that machine as my main workstation,

1044
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,320
I actually think it is worth the upgrade.

1045
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,620
Normally I would say, no, hold off.

1046
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,100
But in this particular case,

1047
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,680
the machines I'm going hands-on all the time, I'm upgrading.

1048
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,720
And the machines that are more appliances

1049
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,080
that I just like the ones here in the studio,

1050
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,200
I'm gonna leave on 1904.

1051
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,820
Yeah, and then usually if you upgrade at least one machine,

1052
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,200
at some point you'll figure out like,

1053
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,220
is this really enough better

1054
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,640
that I'm frustrated at the LTS release now?

1055
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,160
And if not, just leave it.

1056
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,400
I am a little annoyed

1057
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,680
because when I came back to Ubuntu,

1058
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,380
I just wanted to stay on one version for like five years

1059
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,000
because there's this weird part of me

1060
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,040
that really envies people that just like stick to an LTS

1061
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,640
for like the full five years.

1062
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,520
Because LTSs, in my opinion, go through like this life cycle.

1063
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:58,400
1804 is just cresting the boring period of the life cycle.

1064
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,480
And then it'll ride that for a while

1065
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,000
and that sort of like curves down

1066
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,320
and gets more and more boring.

1067
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,800
And especially as like a 1910 comes out

1068
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,640
and stuff like that,

1069
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,600
1804 is gonna seem really boring.

1070
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,100
And then when 2004 comes out,

1071
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,020
like boy, 1804 is gonna seem like a cow.

1072
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:20,020
But then it's sort of like it hits rock bottom around 2004.

1073
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,440
And then when 2010 comes out,

1074
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,760
it kind of starts to get interesting again.

1075
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,800
And then it's like back up,

1076
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:30,000
we're like 1404 and like we're 1604 is right now.

1077
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,820
And it's like still people love it.

1078
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,640
There's people that are still running 1604

1079
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,600
and it works great for them.

1080
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,440
And then you know what?

1081
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,560
They've got all their stuff set up,

1082
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,320
all their PPAs work, all their custom configs work.

1083
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,140
Yeah, when you're still in the support cycle,

1084
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,000
for the most part, it just works.

1085
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,400
I wanted to be that guy.

1086
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:49,120
Shall I offer you a hook to tempt you back to 1804?

1087
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,720
Yeah, do it.

1088
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,520
So those performance improvements

1089
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,440
that you've been able to observe in 1904,

1090
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,600
you're enjoying that, right?

1091
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,800
I am, especially the non-shell stuff.

1092
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,520
Right, so just to be clear

1093
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,160
for the benefit of the listeners,

1094
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,520
this is not work that Canonical are doing

1095
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,800
and holding to our chest, they're not sharing.

1096
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,600
This is all work that's going back upstream.

1097
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,640
However, some of those patches

1098
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,060
haven't completed peer review yet.

1099
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:19,080
So aren't merged into the upstream known project.

1100
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,840
And that's why we're carrying them

1101
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,880
as vendor patches within Ubuntu.

1102
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,360
So we can take advantage of those things now.

1103
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:30,720
That said, all of that hotness is in 1904.

1104
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,120
We have already backported it to 1810,

1105
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:38,000
and those patches will be landing in 1804 soon.

1106
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,960
How is that possible?

1107
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,720
It's a totally different version of Gnome Shell.

1108
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,000
Well, it is a different version,

1109
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,400
but Daniel Van Vo is a magician and he's making it happen.

1110
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,440
He is fixing multiple versions of Gnome Shell.

1111
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,140
Yeah, and this is not uncommon

1112
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,360
within the desktop team, right?

1113
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,320
If you look at some of the applications that we carry,

1114
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,560
we have multiple versions

1115
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,480
across the current supported releases,

1116
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,120
and they will be making patches

1117
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,040
that are different patch sets

1118
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,000
in order to deliver the same functionality

1119
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,800
across versions of applications.

1120
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:10,680
So they're not going to just upgrade 1804 to Gnome 3.3.2,

1121
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,000
they're going to patch the version,

1122
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,880
like what is it, 3.3.0 or whatever that shipped with?

1123
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,960
Yeah, I forget what it is.

1124
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,520
Was it 3.3.26 maybe, 3.3.28, something like that?

1125
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,360
That kind of boggles my mind a little bit.

1126
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,880
That is some work.

1127
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,440
That is some serious work.

1128
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,840
But it's important because people like sticking on LTSs

1129
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,840
and depending upon the LTS

1130
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,720
and depending upon which non-LTS you're looking at,

1131
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,640
I've mentioned this before, it's between 10 and 20 times

1132
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,120
the number of people stick on LTSs than non-LTSs.

1133
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,880
And if we said to everyone,

1134
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,920
hey, it sucks to be you on the LTS,

1135
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,080
we're over here enjoying better performance in non-LTS land,

1136
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,480
then our LTS customers would be very unhappy,

1137
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,400
or 10 times more of them, very unhappy.

1138
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,920
And so it makes total sense

1139
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,720
for the patches that can be back ported.

1140
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,800
And not all of them can, as Martin said,

1141
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,000
some of them are too intrusive and too structural

1142
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,680
and can't be back ported to an older release of Nome Shell

1143
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:10,040
or the underpinnings of Nome Shell.

1144
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,680
But those that can will be.

1145
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,560
And so you don't have to look with envy

1146
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:19,160
at the 1904 users who get all of the performance improvements.

1147
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,200
You'll get some of them as well.

1148
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,960
Somebody ought to send this episode to management

1149
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,760
over at Apple and tell them they can back port

1150
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,000
some of their fixes and old versions of Mac OS.

1151
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,960
Okay, but MiniMac, you get what I'm saying though, right?

1152
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,080
Like there are people that really benefit

1153
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,480
from just sticking with the LTS for like a really long time.

1154
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,760
I believe you're one of them.

1155
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,640
Yeah, in fact, I have one computer

1156
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,360
is my working horse desktop that I rarely upgrade.

1157
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,280
So it's still running 1604

1158
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:46,280
within an enlightenment E22 desktop.

1159
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,280
And I run with enlightenment, some snaps and PPAs,

1160
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,720
and that's working really, really great.

1161
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,600
So no questions asked.

1162
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,560
There's a sentence you don't hear very often

1163
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,760
running enlightenment.

1164
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,880
Yeah, that's great.

1165
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,040
We should get the MiniMac review of enlightenment.

1166
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,000
Totally should, yeah.

1167
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,840
I haven't used that yet.

1168
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1169
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:09,200
I will change my setup probably during this year

1170
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:13,200
and then I can give you a review of enlightenment desktop.

1171
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,320
For me, I think with the multi-monitor setup,

1172
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,640
it's still one of the best desktop environments

1173
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,960
you can have.

1174
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,000
All right, I want that.

1175
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,360
I want that, I want you to do that.

1176
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,200
I totally want that.

1177
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,520
Okay, promised, promised, excellent.

1178
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,840
All right, so that's the big question.

1179
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,160
And it sounds like, I mean, both Wimby and Popey

1180
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,240
are kind of telling me I don't need to upgrade.

1181
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,520
And I think we need to,

1182
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,360
I would like to give an answer to the audience.

1183
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,240
Is it worth upgrading from LTS

1184
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,320
and getting back on this upgrade train?

1185
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:42,160
And maybe it's not, if you're willing to wait around

1186
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,700
and wait for those, I mean, it'll take time

1187
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,480
for those things to get back ported.

1188
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,280
But it sounds like maybe it's not worth it yet,

1189
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,720
unless you really are a gnome shell enthusiast.

1190
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,280
There's pros and cons to staying on the LTS

1191
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,240
or jumping on the interims, right?

1192
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:58,800
If you're a Linux enthusiast,

1193
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,080
and I imagine most people listening to this are,

1194
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:05,680
then running the latest stuff is always sort of compelling

1195
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,520
on what you want to do,

1196
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,720
because you want to play with the latest technology

1197
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,920
and learn it and tinker with it.

1198
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,960
But by the same token, you don't need to do that.

1199
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,480
And there are benefits to staying on the LTS

1200
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,920
because the LTS is well supported out in the wider world.

1201
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,120
Outside of our bubble,

1202
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:26,280
those people that are producing software for Linux

1203
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,640
will absolutely produce packages and software for you

1204
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,120
for the current LTS version,

1205
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,480
not so much for the interim releases.

1206
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,840
So it really depends what you need

1207
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,520
to get out of your machine.

1208
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,720
If you don't need to listen to us for advice,

1209
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,440
then yeah, okay, upgrade.

1210
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:46,040
I would say, I think the consensus is,

1211
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,160
stick with the LTS

1212
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,520
unless you have a compelling reason to upgrade.

1213
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,480
If you're a performance hound,

1214
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,320
and you really, really care about

1215
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,840
the perceived performance of your desktop,

1216
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,280
I will say out of the box,

1217
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,560
the 1904 implementation is clearly faster.

1218
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:04,520
And I have been doing for about 48 hours,

1219
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,360
a little side-by-side GNOME boxes.

1220
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:10,480
I just did a base 1804 install out of the box

1221
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,160
and a base 1904.

1222
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,280
That's a good little experiment.

1223
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,320
Yeah, it was the most up-to-date daily 1904.

1224
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,280
No updates though installed on either,

1225
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,520
just installed them, rebooted once,

1226
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,320
got back to the desktop and then let it ran for 48 hours.

1227
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,920
And without a question,

1228
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,800
I mean, it's clear just by looking at the charts,

1229
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,360
the 1904 version out of the box uses less RAM

1230
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:34,160
and continues to use less RAM the longer GNOME shell runs.

1231
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,880
And I'm talking like,

1232
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,280
it's a difference of about 500 megabytes of RAM right now,

1233
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,680
difference, just sitting there running.

1234
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,520
Yikes.

1235
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:41,640
Yeah, so it really, you know,

1236
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,200
there is clear advantages to the new release.

1237
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,800
That sounds like some of that will be coming back

1238
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,800
to the older versions, maybe not all of it.

1239
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,320
And if you want it today,

1240
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,160
then you basically have to go to 1904.

1241
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,520
That's what it comes down to.

1242
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,040
If you're willing to wait, then you're good.

1243
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,480
Or if you're like me and maybe just gonna switch

1244
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:58,120
to XFCE or Xubuntu, it doesn't matter.

1245
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,960
I was, I just can't believe it.

1246
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,720
I just, you know, I thought I wanted something sexy.

1247
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:06,600
I thought I wanted a desktop that was like plasma,

1248
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,560
that is very, very modern because-

1249
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,240
I think you're making a transition here.

1250
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,600
I think I am.

1251
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,440
I think that's what it is.

1252
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,720
You're approaching the desktop a little bit differently.

1253
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,560
I think I am.

1254
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:18,120
It's going from like the computer is my video game

1255
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,440
and to the computer is my tool.

1256
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,760
And I want my tool to be as effective and efficient

1257
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:26,400
and at the best of doing just what I want it to do.

1258
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,840
And XFCE is really good for that.

1259
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,560
There's one other feature of 1904

1260
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,760
that might be worth touching on.

1261
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,000
Yeah, tell me about it.

1262
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,360
It's a feature in the installer.

1263
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,120
So when you run the install now,

1264
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:43,160
one of the tick boxes,

1265
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,880
it used to be where it used to say

1266
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,320
install third-party codecs and that sort of thing.

1267
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:53,320
That bit of text now says install third-party hardware

1268
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,320
drivers for graphics and wifi.

1269
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:00,760
If you have an Nvidia GPU and you tick that box,

1270
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,920
it will install the proprietary Nvidia drivers for you

1271
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:08,600
so that you've got Nvidia out of the box on your first boot.

1272
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:10,480
That's great.

1273
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,840
That's slick, wow.

1274
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,000
Yeah, it's a good release.

1275
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,960
It's a really good release.

1276
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,560
And I mean, you know, it's not an LTS,

1277
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:20,080
but it is a really good midterm release.

1278
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,760
The Yaru theme is sharp.

1279
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,240
I really like it.

1280
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,360
I installed GNOME tweaks.

1281
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,320
I used the dark mode of it, dark version of it,

1282
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,060
and I think it looks really good.

1283
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:28,900
I just left it.

1284
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:30,840
I mean, this is probably the least tweaking

1285
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,800
and modification I've ever done.

1286
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,240
I spent a lot more time setting up XFCE than I did GNOME Shell.

1287
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,480
So of course now my XFCE is like super dialed in.

1288
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,320
It's really awesome.

1289
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,520
I mean, yeah, once it's tuned, you can make it very lovely.

1290
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,760
All right, I believe for one last time.

1291
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:50,760
Everybody's doing the distro, distro, distro, distro.

1292
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:57,560
Distro, distro, distro, distro, distro, distro.

1293
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,680
Yeah, congratulations to the Canonical team.

1294
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,600
They got a great release.

1295
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:03,760
And now we look forward to other distros

1296
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,480
that are shipping at GNOME 3.3.2

1297
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,360
and see how their implementations stack up.

1298
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,840
There'll be a lot of,

1299
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:11,280
this is probably one of the more exciting release cycles

1300
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,680
that we've entered in a while

1301
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,980
because in a way we're entering a golden age

1302
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:16,120
of GNOME development now.

1303
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,800
And I'm really curious to see

1304
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,240
what the other distros do with it.

1305
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,200
What do you say, Wes?

1306
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,320
What do you say?

1307
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,720
A couple of picks before we get out of here.

1308
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:25,560
No, let's do it.

1309
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,380
We got two picks.

1310
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:27,440
I brought one to the table today

1311
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,880
and Wes brought one to the table.

1312
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:33,880
And let's just say, please, ladies and gentlemen,

1313
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,560
this next pick that we're about to cover here on the show,

1314
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:39,040
please, please do use it responsibly

1315
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,920
because you need to be a good internet citizen.

1316
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:45,520
It's called Party Loud,

1317
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:49,300
a simple tool to generate fake web browsing traffic

1318
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:52,680
and mitigate tracking by essentially blasting web trackers

1319
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,160
with a lot of noise.

1320
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,680
Oh yeah, that's right.

1321
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,720
You got a chance to give it a go.

1322
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,960
In fact, we'll have a link to an ASCII video

1323
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,640
in the show notes if people wanna see Wes's,

1324
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,480
what do you call this?

1325
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,200
A spoof session?

1326
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,560
A Party Loud session?

1327
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:06,440
Yeah, exactly.

1328
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,120
There's a previously, there's a script out there

1329
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,720
that's kind of popular, noisy.py,

1330
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,200
which was the inspiration for this,

1331
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,520
but that's Python, it's a little more complicated.

1332
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,280
Party Loud has the advantage of being

1333
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,320
pretty much just a simple bash script.

1334
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,560
You can and should read it yourself.

1335
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,720
And then otherwise it has a list predetermined.

1336
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,200
You can add your own of websites, queries,

1337
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,360
and then it basically just goes,

1338
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:29,020
spins up a couple of threads with your resolvers,

1339
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,480
goes out and pulls a bunch of websites

1340
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,800
and walks around on the various URLs that they offer.

1341
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,280
And it's like you're doing your own web browsing session.

1342
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,080
Nicely too, it does display it for you

1343
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,120
so you can see what it's doing,

1344
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,640
it's not just off lurking in the background.

1345
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,280
That's why I mentioned the ASCII video.

1346
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,440
It's pretty cool actually watching it go on

1347
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,120
and knock on the doors of all these trackers

1348
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,440
and be like, I'm over here, I'm over here,

1349
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,480
I'm over here, I'm over here.

1350
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,080
It might be convenient too if you just need

1351
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:53,200
some sort of simulated HTTP traffic for a while.

1352
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,360
Yeah, yeah, I don't know, yeah, for testing I suppose.

1353
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,880
Just be careful where you use it

1354
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,680
because it could be kind of network intensive I suppose.

1355
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,000
Its default configuration wasn't crazy,

1356
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,520
it was like every two seconds and had four or five sites.

1357
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,920
But yeah, I'm sure you could tune it to be pretty rough.

1358
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,560
Okay, four or five sites, that's not gonna be too bad.

1359
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,840
That's not gonna be too bad.

1360
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,320
All right, well tell me about,

1361
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,760
tell me about, did I, wait, or no, I found this one.

1362
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,360
Oh, I thought you found, what?

1363
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,440
Maybe we both found it.

1364
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,280
Maybe.

1365
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,120
Oh, maybe, oh, that's what it was is you linked it to me

1366
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,760
and then I added it to my bookmarks

1367
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:26,000
and then I took credit for it, that's what happened.

1368
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,000
It's called NCSpot and it is an NCurses Spotify client

1369
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,280
written in Rust.

1370
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,400
I heard all those things and it just screamed Chris to me.

1371
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,240
I know, that had to go in the show, right?

1372
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:41,440
It's Spotify on the command line, what else do you need to know?

1373
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,240
If you gotta use Spotify, this is the way to do it.

1374
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,040
This is so great and NCurses is wonderful.

1375
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,760
I don't know how you found this, Wes.

1376
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,200
I have not tried this one yet

1377
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,360
because I don't know that they have a release.

1378
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,640
I think you have to actually have a Rust tool chain installed

1379
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,160
and I don't own this laptop.

1380
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,720
I just can't.

1381
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,800
But I'm sure before long that will change

1382
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,440
or maybe you can just get Michael Dominic

1383
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,280
to compile it for you.

1384
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:08,480
I do actually think this would be perfect for the studio.

1385
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,640
I already want it, yeah, for playing music as well.

1386
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,160
We just put my credentials in there

1387
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,480
and just let it connect to my Spotify account.

1388
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,000
Yeah, that's not bad.

1389
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,520
That's pretty cool to have it on the command line

1390
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:21,000
and I'm a sucker for any kind of NCurses you want.

1391
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,440
They're just simple, functional and they look good.

1392
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,800
Yeah, Spotify on the command line, I can't even.

1393
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,080
You know, we ought to get some pics from the audience.

1394
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,600
We haven't got, I don't think we've got any for ages.

1395
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:32,440
Help us out.

1396
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,920
LinuxUnplugged.com slash contact.

1397
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:37,360
You can send us show feedback but also pick suggestions

1398
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,720
or you can tweet Wes or myself at Chris Elias

1399
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,720
or me at Wes Payne for him.

1400
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:43,560
I've got a pic.

1401
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:44,400
Yeah, oh, you do?

1402
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,440
I'd love to hear it. Amazing.

1403
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,400
I do.

1404
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,360
Now, don't everyone groan when you hear the name.

1405
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:52,160
Just hear what it does after I tell you the name.

1406
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,000
Okay.

1407
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,480
This is called Electron Player

1408
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:58,400
and it's, among other things,

1409
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,440
it's a Linux desktop Netflix client.

1410
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,520
Oh, what?

1411
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,520
Can you drop a link to that

1412
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,360
and show us what's on the show notes?

1413
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:10,360
Yeah, it's snapcraft.io forward slash electron player.

1414
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,680
I spoke to the author a little while ago

1415
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,880
and it also does YouTube and float plane

1416
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,920
and a couple of other streaming services

1417
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,680
but it's got all of the DRM modules baked in

1418
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,160
so you can unclutter your browser

1419
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,960
and dedicate some screen space

1420
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:29,400
to a desktop client video player.

1421
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,240
That's brilliant.

1422
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,080
That's great.

1423
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:33,120
That, oh, I love it.

1424
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,960
I'm giving that one another ding.

1425
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:35,800
Good pick.

1426
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:36,640
Yeah, we'll throw a link to that

1427
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,480
in the show notes right now.

1428
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,320
You know what?

1429
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,760
I'm gonna take that, Electron Player.

1430
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,680
That's a great use for Electron right there, right?

1431
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,800
Because you're using web streaming services anyways.

1432
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:44,640
That's a great use case.

1433
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,480
It kind of just makes sense.

1434
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,320
It does kind of just make sense.

1435
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,760
Go check out the Ubuntu podcast.

1436
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,720
Go get more Popey, Wimpy, and Mark II

1437
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:53,120
over at ubuntupodcast.org.

1438
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,080
You guys want to tease anything for an upcoming episode?

1439
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,840
Anything in the works?

1440
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,240
Next episode's out in a couple of days.

1441
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:02,800
We're apparently planning an extravaganza for Foss Talk Live

1442
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,280
but I've not been completely looped in

1443
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,400
on this extravaganza.

1444
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,640
The other two have got planned.

1445
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,880
So I'm looking forward to finding out

1446
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:09,920
what that's all about.

1447
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,560
And of course, both you gentlemen

1448
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:14,720
will be at Linux Fest Northwest in just a few days.

1449
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:15,880
Very exciting. We will.

1450
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,840
This time next week we'll be on a plane or something,

1451
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:18,800
I think, Popey and I.

1452
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,160
Yeah.

1453
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,640
I should be having stern words with him

1454
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,920
about GPUs as well.

1455
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:24,920
That's right.

1456
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:27,240
Make sure he never gets that wrong again.

1457
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,800
Yeah, when you get here, you got to stop by.

1458
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,200
Maybe we'll do dinner or something.

1459
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,640
Telegram me when you get in.

1460
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:35,040
I'm going to, I'll be waiting, watching your flights,

1461
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:35,880
tracking you now.

1462
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:36,720
You cannot escape him.

1463
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,080
We'll turn tracking on for you, Chris.

1464
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:41,200
Very, very good.

1465
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,160
All right, well, that brings us to the end

1466
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:46,600
of this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

1467
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,080
Links to everything we talked about

1468
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:49,480
are in your podcast player of choice

1469
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:52,160

1472
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,880
What else should we plug?

1473
00:53:58,880 --> 00:53:59,880
The Friday wrap up stream.

1474
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:00,720
Mention that again.

1475
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:04,680
Oh yeah, come join us live on Friday, 2 p.m. JB time.

1476
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:07,000
That and this are like the two times

1477
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
I get to see people live.

1478
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,080
So come say hi.

1479
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:13,040
You can also hang out here over at jblive.tv.

1480
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,480
We do this on a Tuesday.

1481
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,800
Go to Jupiterbroadcasting.com

1482
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,200
to get that converted to your local time.

1483
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,920
Thanks so much for joining us.

1484
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,000
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1485
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,520
Ah!

1486
00:54:53,520 --> 00:55:06,120
So Cheese, I'm curious, what do you think about Linus Tech Tips getting into Linux coverage?

1487
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:08,920
This is like the third or fourth Linux video they've done in a year.

1488
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:10,400
They're getting to, they're doing it more and more.

1489
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,400
Yeah.

1490
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,400
What do you think, Bacon?

1491
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,400
You know, it's kind of interesting.

1492
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:19,240
I have some friends that game on their desktops and use Windows primarily.

1493
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:24,640
And this past week, I guess they caught the video, I didn't plug it to them or anything,

1494
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:27,880
but they caught the video and they were asking me, dude, what's up with Linux?

1495
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:28,880
What is this?

1496
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:29,880
What's this all about?

1497
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:34,320
So I had to kind of give them the quick two minute rundown.

1498
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,920
Look at you, ambassador to Linux.

1499
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:36,920
Yeah, right?

1500
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,720
Well, and I've been telling them for years, man, that they need to look into it.

1501
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:43,880
But you know, until it revolves around gaming, I guess it doesn't matter to them.

1502
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:49,760
I am both very excited to get more Linux coverage and get more users over and both that and

1503
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:50,760
a little nervous.

1504
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:55,860
That's like, I don't necessarily know if gaming is the real hard sale we want to make.

1505
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:57,360
Come over and emulate your Windows games.

1506
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:01,840
I mean, I know I'm being harsh there, but I just feel like it's not the strongest foot

1507
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:02,840
forward.

1508
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:06,160
Like you want to come over and be a, you know, assistant administrator or developer or learn

1509
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,840
to develop, you know, educational stuff.

1510
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:09,840
Like that's great.

1511
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:13,120
I think Google saying that with Stadia, right?

1512
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:18,480
Yeah, it's just as Proton adds compatibility with more Windows games, it naturally opens

1513
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,400
it up to a larger audience.

1514
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,180
It's just it's sort of selling Linux on something that's getting much, much, much, much better

1515
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:30,120
at and has gotten much better at, but it's not selling it on its absolute strongest,

1516
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,120
strongest case.

1517
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,120
That's all.

1518
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,120
And I just.

1519
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,120
Right.

1520
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:37,040
It's hard to be like a really enthusiast evangelist when you're like, but also just to clarify,

1521
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,240
this has been a weak spot that it's getting better at.

1522
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:42,000
So it might not be perfect and a lot of stuff doesn't work great.

1523
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,720
And when you play that network game that uses DRM, it's probably not going to work quite

1524
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:46,720
right.

1525
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:51,220
And those kinds of things like, at the same time, I'm like, you know, anything that gets

1526
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:56,160
people interested and has them checking it out and downloading an ISO and giving it a

1527
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:02,240
go, you know, maybe for every, for every thousand, for 50 of them to a hundred of them, it sticks.

1528
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,240
Even that would be good.

1529
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,240
Yeah, absolutely.

1530
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:07,560
And, you know, MSS, they're seeing a bunch of big downloads, so that's great too.

1531
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:11,720
And I mean, gaming has come a long way on Linux, so it's probably good to talk about

1532
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:12,720
it a little more.

1533
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:18,480
And it's also interesting to hear people outside the quote unquote community talk about the

1534
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,480
distributions.

1535
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:22,560
Like the way they talk about Ubuntu and the way they talk about Manjaro and the way they

1536
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:23,560
talk about Pop OS.

1537
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,400
I find that to be really interesting too.

1538
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:32,240
It's sort of like getting to observe like a scientific experiment as they discover and

1539
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,240
learn and explore.

1540
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:35,760
Let's observe the humans as they try out Linux.

1541
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:36,760
Yeah.

1542
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:50,680
They're going to be so happy.
