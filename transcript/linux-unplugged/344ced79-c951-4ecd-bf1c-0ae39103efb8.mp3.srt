00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,040
Headline the anatomy of a linux user by ken stark, and i'm just going through here

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,520
Her computer was a decent machine a mid 2005 asus desktop with a dell 19-inch monitor

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,860
Unfortunately it had all the toolbars and pop-ups that a windows user can collect when not properly tendered

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,080
After getting all the files off the computer we began to product the process of installing linux

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,400
We sat together through the installation process, and I made sure she understood partitioning process inside of an hour

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,020
She had a bright and new shiny pc linux os

7
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,940
desktop and I think

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,740
that right there

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,740
pretty much

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,900
Exemplifies most of the people that I end up switching to linux right it's that easy it is it's that easy

11
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:45,100
And it you take hardware that already existed and is no longer useful, and we make it useful again

12
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,380
There's a lot of power to that that is so happy hacking

13
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:57,380
This is linux unplugged episode 147 for may 31st 2016

14
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:13,060
Welcome to linux unplugged your weekly linux talk show where we've kicked your host out of his seat and made him the soundboard operator

15
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,780
Where he let the batteries die in the mouse?

16
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,980
My name is Noah. My name is Wes welcome Wes pleasure to have you here, Noah all right, so this week

17
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,460
We have a ton of stuff coming up in

18
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:30,700
Linux unplugged we're gonna be talking to Ryan from mycroft. We're gonna be talking about openSUSE

19
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,260
I know that you've installed remix OS

20
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:37,220
Which is you've somehow decided to take your useful laptop and relegate it to an Android device

21
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,440
And we're gonna talk about Yubi keys which I have gone on the record numerous time extolling their

22
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,220
virtues and as it turns out they have turned from a

23
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:50,500
Open-source company into a closed-source company, and I just bought some but does that really matter. I don't know we'll find out

24
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,740
We'll talk about it and of course every week. We have to welcome

25
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,620
The mumble room which sometimes I forget about so hello

26
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,180
mumble room

27
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,900
Oh my gosh, we have we have a full mumble room and we have beer

28
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,260
Those are my two favorite things in the whole world beer this week is

29
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:14,300
Almeda Brewing Company Alameda

30
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,460
All right, so gentlemen with the beer tell me how the beer is

31
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:23,780
Hmm well, so hold on yeah, hold on still here. We got we I got him

32
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,100
I got a beer and West got a different beer. I got the pale ale from Alameda

33
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:33,700
I have their IPA the click a cat or clicky tat clicky tat. I think yellow wolf. It's pretty good. It's actually pretty good

34
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,420
It's from Portland, Oregon

35
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:39,540
It's from so the I'll be just be standing by in the background drinking well Brown by your drive, okay?

36
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,500
Yeah, that's I I had to have a Desi there you go no back to you

37
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,460
Yeah, polar bear is polar bear is on it. Just make sure to charge those mouse batteries

38
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,180
So we have beer and so that makes for a good show

39
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,340
I

40
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,220
Don't know how many of you remember arch assault and arch assault

41
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,420
for those of you who are not familiar is basically a

42
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:08,980
A distro kind of like Cali except based on arch. It's a distro specifically designed for penetration testing and

43
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,380
network security testing right

44
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,780
obviously when you're doing network security testing and penetration testing one of the really important things is

45
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:22,700
Is to stay up-to-date and to have up-to-date software and of course you want to be aware of up-to-date exploits

46
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,620
And so you want to go to pull down the latest packages, and so there's a fundamental

47
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,900
disconnect

48
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,860
You know to to some degree anyway when we are trying to do that on a distro

49
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:39,080
That is not rolling that is that is stuck in time right and so that's kind of where arch assault originally

50
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:44,340
Kind of took off and I had the pleasure of talking with these guys back at Southeast Linux fest

51
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,860
2014 I believe yeah, and we had a really good discussion

52
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:55,060
And they were showing you know the the the gentleman that I talked to he really took the the project to heart and he really

53
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,260
Spent a lot of time and effort and passion they had shirts they had you know little banners made up

54
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:03,740
And this is when the project is at its infancy right and so him and his wife are sitting see people that excited about it

55
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:08,100
Already yeah, yeah, you can you could feel the passion and him and his wife actually took the time

56
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:14,920
To settle this stuff was a very well-branded project, and I understand that they have gone through some changes well turns out

57
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,580
This week we learned that

58
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,700
They have announced a new name

59
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,500
So headline this is from softpedia

60
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:29,620
Dot-com the team over at arch assault a new Linux operating system based on the famous arch Linux distro

61
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:36,620
Designed for ethical hackers announced a few minutes ago on their Twitter account that they were changing the name to arch strike

62
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:43,320
Designed from the ground up as a security layer to arch Linux the arch assault project provides security researchers and

63
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:50,300
Hackers with one of the most powerful open source and totally free Linux kernel based operating systems for penetration testing and security

64
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,860
auditing operations under the new umbrella band

65
00:04:53,300 --> 00:05:01,420
Called arch strike the project promises a bleeding-edge pen test distro to anyone who wants to join the fight for freedom of expression privacy

66
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:09,620
On the internet and it can be considered a direct competitor to Kali Linux previously known as

67
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,220
Backtrack has anyone in the mumble room

68
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:18,200
Let's start with this has anyone in the mumble room participated in a penetration penetration testing

69
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,100
Or have you have experience with Kali Linux? I?

70
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:28,960
Have personally used Kali Linux for certain purposes. I can't legally say what?

71
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:35,020
That I've had limited experience with it. They worked fairly smooth when I tried it a few years ago

72
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:41,480
So I haven't had experience since then okay, so you have have you had a chance to try?

73
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,920
Have you have you heard of archers alters as the first year you're hearing about it

74
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:51,780
No, I've heard of arches Hulk. I'm sure other people have in the chat room. Yeah

75
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,000
The have you have you played with it at all

76
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,800
No, I haven't gone back to arch yet, so I'm debating going to arch

77
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:08,040
Yeah, I'm not sure if I would have used for a pen testing to show outside of a work environment

78
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,640
Well, I think so I I think I don't think this is geared

79
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,760
Outside of that spectrum right because so nobody installs a penetration

80
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:24,720
I mean well most most people most practical people that are not the star of a reality show

81
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,720
Don't install a penetration testing distro as their daily driver, right?

82
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,640
It's not it's not a terribly practical thing not to mention you have a bunch of software in there that you don't really need

83
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:40,420
So I'm you know my thought on it is that I think that arch assault is basically

84
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,580
designed to do what

85
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,300
What Cali is doing except do it on based on arch no

86
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,700
Yeah, that would be a fair assessment

87
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,620
It's really weird because I have seen reader posts on reddit or other

88
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:02,820
For websites where people all I'm gonna sell arch assault or Cali Linux

89
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:07,980
And I'm like why you don't need to unless you're doing this work. You don't need to

90
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:14,380
Use this operating system for that it doesn't make sense. Mm-hmm. I

91
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,260
Think more had had something to say as well. Yeah, I go ahead were it

92
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:24,260
Yeah, the I'm familiar with the guys from the arch assault and that arch strike team

93
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,420
And I just wanted to point out that it's not actually a distro in itself

94
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,460
It's more of a layer or a package set that goes on top of arch

95
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,940
so you have your normal working arch installation or

96
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:41,080
hand or gross or whichever variation you choose to use and then you can pull these packages in to give you all that

97
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:45,140
Functionality and then if you want to later down run you just pull them all out and go away. Oh nice

98
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,580
So way more useful to me. So you so

99
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,860
So you're telling me that they they do intend you to run this as a daily driver and then just pull down

100
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,220
This set of packages that you need to do your work

101
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:04,500
Exactly. So it's actually an addition to whatever your daily driver is. They're not gonna make this OS version

102
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,520
That's just for penetration testing and security tools

103
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:14,500
It's I'm gonna give you all the packages you want that arch itself doesn't have and we're to keep them up-to-date and rolling as best

104
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:19,720
We can gotcha my mind that works very like if I personally at least have a lot of arch based workflows as it's you know

105
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,400
The main distro I use right would fit very well in that right a repo your package is there now

106
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,980
You've built yourself a new pen testing laptop from your same install script

107
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:31,180
So you touch on something that I think is is really pertinent. So Chris for example does not

108
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,940
he lives inside of arch right and so

109
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,940
Taking him outside of that takes him not only outside his comfort zone

110
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:43,660
but it also decreases his efficiency right because he is the ability to find the tools and make them work in a given distro and

111
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:49,160
so if you take somebody that lives on arch all day and all night and now you put them into a work environment and they

112
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:55,260
Can bring in that that tool set that they need to do their job do their job and then relinquish it and go back to

113
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,220
You know, whatever. I think that as a global idea

114
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,620
I think opens up a lot of real possibilities for Linux

115
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:07,580
Anyone else in the mobile room have any thoughts or experience with arch assault or if warhead if you have more dad

116
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,920
I know that you're you're a pretty well heavily in communication with the guys that do this

117
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,940
Anyone and yeah, I can't really add too much to it. The change actually happened quite a while ago

118
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,660
It's just that somehow we realized that people had missed it

119
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:30,360
So we added it to the recent Twitter's and now soft media has it it's been resubmitted across blogs across the net for like two

120
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,620
days straight

121
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,620
Yeah, that's about how it goes, right?

122
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:38,020
All right. Well moving on headline from seuss.com

123
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:49,660
Seuss Linux Enterprise 12 SP service back to beta and open QA status of QA automation and

124
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:57,100
And the article goes on here to say in mid-may we have reached the beta phase of sluss 12 SP 2

125
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:02,740
So I would like to look back a little bit and see what we've achieved and it's not it's also it's not just less

126
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,640
in fact, there's some really cool stuff this one of the reasons I think we should talk about this is

127
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:12,140
Sless and the other projects are now sort of interweaved and Richard could could tell you about that

128
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,620
It's it's sort of fascinating because when you see a new beta of less coming that also means

129
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:20,740
There's a new version of something for us average users coming too. I think is that right Richard?

130
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:25,100
Yeah, I mean this is actually like the first time we've been doing this

131
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:32,440
Full hog this this interweaved. It's a bit of an experiment still so the yeah the sluss 12 SP 2 beta

132
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:37,620
Yeah, the beta phase has started beta ones just come out which

133
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,500
that's basically like the

134
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:46,340
The real go point for open suzer to now start working on a leap because that's the point where?

135
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,220
You know sleepy two customers now have their hands on the sleigh code

136
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,980
Well, if they have the hands on it open suzer has the hands on it, too

137
00:10:53,300 --> 00:11:00,400
So we've got that now in OBS and we've started building leap. So within like a day of well actually a day before that announcement

138
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,600
We've already got

139
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,620
Leap 42.2 out for one. So, you know sleaze in beta we're in alpha and

140
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:12,980
And we're basically kind of following that that mirrored route all the way up to November

141
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,300
So every time we have alpha 2 coming out

142
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,980
Any day now because sleaze doing beta 2 any day now

143
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,820
and you know following following this all the way along and

144
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:30,380
Yeah, it's it's really it's really interesting seeing this whole thing working because we're doing

145
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,260
really exciting things on both sides

146
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:38,460
Like on the enterprise side this service pack is definitely going to be something special

147
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:43,420
You don't normally see a an enterprise service pack that goes. Yeah. Okay

148
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:49,780
We'll have a new gnome and a new kernel and a new system D and I've probably missed something big in there

149
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,300
I do

150
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,860
Have a question about leap. Does it have support for?

151
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:03,220
It have support for does it have support for

152
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:10,660
Backfires no, no, no not ZFS. It's a oh

153
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:16,260
I can't believe it just slipped my mind. I thought about it and then a boom lost it

154
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,220
When it comes back, it's fun. Yeah. Yeah, so

155
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,260
You know Richard, I guess wait, can you give me some examples of?

156
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:31,180
Some of the common common things that you've seen some of the big things that you've seen less being used for lately. Oh

157
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,660
Slez is

158
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:41,780
Slez is doing really well as usual in all of those kind of big heavy mission critical enterprise environments. I mean sues is doing

159
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,980
Very well with that at the moment

160
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,900
I'm not allowed to speak too much about it because we're a public company

161
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,300
But you know figures are coming out soon and it'll be fun to talk about

162
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:57,820
Because it's it's looking it's being used really heavily in those sort of big hefty mission critical environments. Let's 12 is really kind of

163
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:02,380
Sues it in that place. So I joke with you guys from time to time

164
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:07,580
But the reality is I do encounter a sues, you know in the wild and I actually I was working for a client

165
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:14,220
Just a couple weeks ago that was using that was using sues enterprise and they were using it

166
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:20,340
Actually in a lotus notes domino hosted environment. Are you familiar with that? Yeah

167
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:29,740
It's actually it's so the the domino version was was version 8 5 3 and the lotus notes version was was 9 what they call

168
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:33,820
social edition, but the cool thing was is that they came to me and they had a

169
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:40,060
whole host of infrastructure that was hosted in this and they said our server died and we don't know what we're gonna do and

170
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:45,340
So and they were hosting this on on on Susan so I was kind of learning the ins and outs and while I'm doing this

171
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:49,780
I actually made a recommendation. I'm like, well, you know, it would take a couple days for us to get a server here for you

172
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,460
We could take a couple days to get a server here for you

173
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:59,660
but what we could do for the time being or for a permanent thing is we can rent you a server over a digital ocean comm

174
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:06,240
And they were actually able to use the code do unplugged to get a $10 credit off there

175
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,760
We guys cooking chicken, yeah

176
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:16,080
They were able to get $10 off which got him the first two months cuz they were actually able to run that on a $5 rig

177
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,840
And actually sometimes I think that people don't understand all the things you can do on just the $5 rig

178
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:27,720
The thing that they fall down on in that $5 rig is of course storage, but guess what digital ocean is working on that

179
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,640
I'm so excited. Are you signed up for the beta? Yes, I am. I'm signed up for the beta. That is neat

180
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,640
Yes

181
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,960
So they

182
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:41,080
Basically the the one one thing that I have I have desired

183
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,000
Well, there's actually two things I've desired from digital ocean

184
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,160
One is I want to be able to custom upload my ISOs

185
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:51,640
But because they have basically ever destroyed use anyway, not such a big deal. The second thing I want is more storage

186
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,680
So this block storage thing

187
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:57,440
I'm in the beta program and I think we're getting closer to actually getting it because I got an email from them

188
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:02,080
Three days ago or four days ago and they wanted a survey about all the things I was going to do

189
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:07,160
Oh, yeah, did you get that? I did. Yeah, so I answered that and and hopefully that means that we are getting

190
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,800
hopefully that means that we're getting much closer to the

191
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,280
It's actually having block storage is something I'm super looking forward to

192
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,880
Now I want to talk about

193
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,840
So I have numerous times gone on record and talked about how much I

194
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,160
Like the Yuba keys, right?

195
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:32,280
they have fundamentally changed the way that I do my job and at this point, I

196
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,960
Don't know that I'd say I can't live without a Yuba key

197
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:40,880
But I certainly can't live without the functionality and convenience that the Yuba key gives me. I mean, they're like it's um

198
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,800
It's a little bit like a root of trust in your in the way you operate, right? So quick recap

199
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,000
Yuba key what it's allowing me to do is

200
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:55,080
Without giving up the private key store my SSH certificates on a hardware based token that literally never leaves my side

201
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,320
And I say that as I'm looking around for it. I have two

202
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,680
I have one that I wear around my neck that I've taken off because it jingles when I'm in the studio and the second one

203
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,100
Is actually you can't see it, but it's it's just trust me. It's in there

204
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,440
They have recently come out with the four and said that

205
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:18,420
It is no longer going to be an open source device that they're gonna close source it now

206
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,560
the critical question is

207
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:27,360
It doesn't change anything because you couldn't really do anything with the source code anyway, right?

208
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,640
It's a hardware based device and you still have to trust and you couldn't change the firmware on the device, right?

209
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,120
And you still you're essentially you still have to trust the manufacturer

210
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:40,400
Needless to say I am a little concerned how many people in the mumble room are using Yuba key

211
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:48,240
Lots I see I I did just buy a Yuba key for before this news came out like oh, did you weeks before?

212
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:55,760
Yeah, okay. Well, I'm not I'm not ready to hand up my Yuba key. There is a competitor up that I am in seriously considering

213
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,800
And it is called the nitro key

214
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what it is

215
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,400
Yeah

216
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:04,680
Uh-huh

217
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:11,160
So and what the nitro key is is it's kind of the same thing where you have a hardware based device that allows you to store

218
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,240
A certificate now a couple things jump out at me

219
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,240
The first is that it is an open source device

220
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,620
So that I'm happy with it has an open source public post by Cardware public software software

221
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,120
The thing that I'm not so big on is

222
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,160
Look at the thing, right?

223
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:31,680
If I go up here and look this is a very large device

224
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,360
Also, it's a very plastic looking device

225
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,400
The Yuba key is sleek and the Yuba keys I got to tell you I have had one on my lanyard

226
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,400
I when I first bought it actually bought two

227
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,940
Actually, I bought a lot more to it, but I bought him for everyone in the company, right? Everyone in my company gets

228
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,680
Yeah, yeah, we issued about and because if I fire somebody I

229
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,800
Asked them for the Yuba key back. They give it back to me

230
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:59,260
I know that those servers are still secure because that Yuba key has never given up that private duplicate. You're right

231
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,360
But I bought two for myself

232
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,960
Originally and the idea was I was gonna have one around my neck and I was gonna leave one at home and my fireproof safe

233
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,640
It's kind of like a backup because I have contracts

234
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,320
with certain places that you know, um, I

235
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,920
Don't know really what I want to share in the air

236
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:21,440
But I have contracts with certain places that have very very high you need guarantees

237
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,480
security protocols

238
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:28,740
And so I am NOT allowed to access the the SSH files if I want to add a key

239
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:33,280
I have to write out a justification form and I have to explain everything and I have to give the key and I have to

240
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,860
Send it in then they have to make a change. It takes like three weeks and it's a real pain and so

241
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:41,420
Absolutely to avoid all that, you know, this has really changed everything, but I wanted to have two of them one

242
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,420
I kept it with me and then one I kept secure

243
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,860
and

244
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:50,500
What I noticed was that it was originally I was concerned that it was going to get broken or damaged

245
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,580
That's why I needed a backup turns out like those things are indestructible. I put my through by washing machine

246
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,100
It has fallen out of my Wow. I'm driving down the interstate

247
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,620
And you got it back. Yeah

248
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:04,540
My laptop has fallen over on top of it. Like they are practically indestructible. I

249
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:11,020
Can't say the same about this thing. It it does not look like it has the same build quality as

250
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,440
The Yuba key and that's a little concerning to me

251
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:20,900
Mumbo room, even if you guys don't have experience with the the Yuba key. Do you guys have any opinions or thoughts?

252
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:27,100
Yeah, I do the nitro key. I looked at their website and they're really lacking in detail

253
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:33,780
Like does that does it even retract? Does it have two slots like the Yuba key does with the long press and the short press?

254
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:38,420
And it just seemed like there was no real comparison between the different models, right?

255
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:44,140
It's quite early. I think for the for the company. So I have to wait and see I think if I'm not mistaken

256
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:47,300
It's based on the FST zero token that's already working with G knock

257
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,820
And so yeah, it does have a couple key slots and everything. It's similar to the way the Yuba key works

258
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:57,460
Okay now in terms of the open PGP stuff. Now, what is your thought William about what about the

259
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,020
About the lack of of Yuba key being open source. Does that matter?

260
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:05,540
It doesn't really matter to me because I still had to trust them as a manufacturing partner, right?

261
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:11,140
Like they are ultimately manufacturing it. They are, you know planting the firmware on it at build time. You can't change it

262
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:16,340
It's impossible thing. I don't necessarily like about the nitro key. Is that you can change the firmware and

263
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,940
Typically with Gina since they are using Gina it will wipe all the keys on there

264
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,840
But I feel like you could probably flash it in such a way that it won't necessarily wipe the keys

265
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:30,160
And so the security of that whole environment is kind of questionable, especially with that cheap plastic case

266
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:34,860
That's easy to take off right see and that's that's see and you're hitting on kind of where where I come at it

267
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:40,700
too is it it feels like the Yuba key was built for commercial enterprise grade use and it feels like the nitro key is like

268
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,700
somebody's really great garage idea

269
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:50,860
Basically, I would like to weigh in that, you know there we we used Yuba keys here for quite a lot of stuff

270
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:56,940
Especially for folks who are jumping into servers all the time, but Red Hat released an open source app on

271
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:01,700
On at least it's on Android. I don't know if it's on iOS called free OTP

272
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:07,400
It's essentially one-time password generator, but software, you know

273
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:12,360
So you can you can load that up on your phone and use it to generate your one-time pass

274
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,940
And it works with everything that we've got deployed

275
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:21,540
You can also use it in place of the g-auth indicator a Google indicator app. It's quite wonderful

276
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,180
Yeah, you know the thing is I I

277
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:31,700
I just there's something about me and I'm sure I'm gonna catch flack for saying this especially after Sunday's episode

278
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,500
But I have a problem with the idea of Google two-factor authentication

279
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:40,220
When I'm logging into my Google account on a Google server with a Google password

280
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:46,120
And then the two-factor authentication I have is a software app written by Google put on a Google device. I

281
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,380
mean

282
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,380
That's a lot of Google

283
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:56,700
iPhone man. Yeah. Yeah. Well the software still written by Google, right? I just the thing that I like about my YubiKey

284
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,140
What when it comes to two-factor authentication is like I feel like

285
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:06,380
The parties involved like last pass and YubiKey totally separate entities and really have nothing to gain, you know from working with each

286
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,940
I just I guess because Google have anything to gain from

287
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:15,700
Sidestepping their authentication parameters. They can already do that internally. Anyway, I would imagine that's kind of my point

288
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:20,540
What do they really have to gain from somehow subverting what they're trying to do with these different applications?

289
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:26,780
That's exactly my point when it comes to last pass might my last pass vaults encrypted client side with it with the with the key

290
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:31,820
You know, there's two-factor authentication that is totally separate from last pass with whereas Google is you know

291
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:39,060
You're making my point is they you're essentially you're essentially saying like it's basically to keep the honest people honest outside of Google because if Google

292
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,060
Really wanted to get to your stuff your host anyway

293
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,780
If I'm not misunderstanding you

294
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:48,860
Yes, but you're still using that two-factor for your Google services, so yeah

295
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,900
well, anyway, so I

296
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:57,660
Just there's something about me that likes having having those two separate. Maybe I admit maybe that's just maybe that's fun

297
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,900
Maybe I'm just maybe I'm an old fuddy-duddy. I don't know

298
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,540
but I

299
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:05,340
Haven't quite decided if I'm if I'm ready to jump ship on

300
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,300
On YubiKey or not. I feel like it could go both ways

301
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,300
anyone else in the mumbo-room have thoughts or

302
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:16,580
Opinion on the on the whole YubiKey situation, even if you haven't used it. I'm interested what you think. I

303
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,460
Think they should have kept it open source. Keep it free software

304
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,900
Okay, why do you say that? Why do you think it matters?

305
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:29,540
Because Williams right at the end of the day you're trusting it rather the manufacturer publishes the spec or not

306
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,060
You're you're essentially you're trusting them

307
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:36,220
I mean unless you have an electrical engineering degree and can go verify these things you're trusting the manufacturer anyway, right?

308
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:41,980
The hardware if it's got the code in the hard way, and you can't change it. That's fine

309
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,980
but if

310
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:49,980
You but it does have access to it and you can change the hard software on the hardware

311
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:53,340
You should have access to the source code

312
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,300
GPU G and a that

313
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,860
Yeah, the GPL

314
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:04,020
Please offer foundation. I'm a member here. Yeah, I'm gonna throw back to you William. What was your response to that?

315
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:08,700
My response was the YubiKey does not allow you to change the software. It's physically fused onto the board

316
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,700
Like you can't change it once it's printed

317
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,700
And so I'm where is there and correct me if I'm wrong and correct me if I'm wrong

318
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:23,740
Somebody correct me if I'm wrong doesn't Richard Stoneman himself advocate as it'd be okay to have binary blobs as long as they can't be changed

319
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,740
Yes, he does

320
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:31,260
He'd use the microwave example, I think for this where if your microwave has software running on it that you can't change. That's fine

321
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,300
And the YubiKey is kind of the same thing. It's a black box

322
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:39,980
So if you can validate that it works correctly then and the software can't be changed. That's fine, right Ryan

323
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,980
You're thinking there's a security

324
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,180
implication here

325
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:47,740
Well, it's just the ability to audit, you know, that's what that's what for me

326
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:54,540
Brint makes open source more secure. And so I I can't say that I really understand the reasoning here

327
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:59,180
I understand that it's a simple tool that generates, you know based on a counter, you know

328
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:03,740
The one-time password, but I don't like the ability to audit. I mean, I can

329
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:09,260
So, let's back up for a second first of all, that is one

330
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:14,620
Very well, that is one component of the YubiKey, right? There's a lot of different ways to do it

331
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:19,260
Very well, that is one component of the YubiKey, right? There is the there are three components the YubiKey

332
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,460
There is the smart card identification, which I'm using for SSH authentication

333
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:26,060
There's the one-time password authentication. Then there's the U2F standard. So

334
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:33,660
So it is a little bit more complex than just it is it is it is spinning out a random number generator

335
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,420
Coupled with a you know an algorithm to spin out a one-time password there

336
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:41,420
There is there so there is something to be said about like I eventually am

337
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:45,980
You know in trusting that the SSH certificate that I wrote onto this device

338
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:53,020
You know is is secure. So there's some argument to be made there. I just I question how valid it is in the world and I think

339
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,900
Was it wizard Jed you were going to say something?

340
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,380
Yeah

341
00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:00,940
I was going to say you can test every single one of these things in a really basic scenario

342
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,220
And the only thing you can't do and I believe it's for the YubiKey Neo

343
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:09,900
It has a an NFC that would be more difficult to test but it should also be just as easily tested

344
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:13,100
Yeah, yeah, it shouldn't be that hard to test

345
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,980
All right. Anyone else have closing thoughts on YubiKey?

346
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:22,060
Yeah, I think with the trust issue. I personally trust an open source company more than a closed source one

347
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:27,180
Um, but I mean if all you're doing is using it as a two-factor authenticated to get into your google account

348
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,100
I don't think it really matters

349
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:35,660
If you're using it for sort of encrypting your email that is super sensitive. I'd I'd be a bit more wary

350
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,580
well, I mean

351
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:43,740
So it to some some degree I am trusting that every server that I own or run has my YubiKey

352
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:47,340
ssh certificate in it. So I I mean there is a certain level of trust there, but

353
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:55,580
I'm hoping that they um that by them doing this that doesn't um that they're not doing this to their older products

354
00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:00,540
So you still have those available that are open source that you can use nothing

355
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:04,460
I've read suggests that they are doing this with any of their older stuff

356
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:09,500
It seems like all of this is is their new production, right? I don't think they're changing any of the old stuff

357
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:17,260
I want to talk about Krita 3.0 Krita 3.0 was released today the team at Krita releases 3.0 the animation release

358
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:24,220
Wrapping up a year of work. This is a really big release animation support integrated into Krita's core

359
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:32,220
Instant preview for better performance painting and drawing with brushes on big canvases ported to the latest version of qt platform and many bigger

360
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:39,180
And smaller new features and improvements to mention now. I know we have a number of different graphic artists in the community

361
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,500
I know. Mr. Rotten corpses. I know Odyssey Westra is

362
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,300
Has anyone had experience using Krita?

363
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:51,900
No one huh? Well not in any professional sense, how about in an unprofessional sense

364
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:59,100
And I guess like, you know, you're using this in place of GIMP or something like that. Well, here's why I ask wizard is because

365
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,580
There is a lot to be said for

366
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:06,620
An application that is easy and approachable and Wes

367
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:10,940
I know that you you and I kind of fall into this at the same time like you and I have very busy

368
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:15,180
Professional lives and so when it comes to our to enjoy software

369
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:18,380
We have to find software that's easily approachable and we can just sit down and do something right?

370
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:22,140
I mean if it's going to take more than a half hour to really get going or have some sort of progress

371
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:26,060
There's there's not I can't do that every day, right? Like maybe maybe a weekend if it's important software

372
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:29,340
But if it's really gonna be useful to me, I need to be able to figure it out pretty quick. Yeah

373
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:33,580
And and I feel the same way like I you know, I want to sit some sit down and bang something out

374
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:37,180
And one of the things I have used, you know, I found I found the GIMP to be

375
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,500
totally

376
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:44,940
Unintuitive I I can't I can crop pictures in the GIMP and I can make some minor changes, but really

377
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:49,100
The way I see it is like I can do all the things I've always been able to do in GIMP

378
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:53,100
But I haven't really learned how to do anything new and different quite some time. Whereas it feels like

379
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,140
Other software, it's a lot more easy to explore or I'm actually excited about the new features and

380
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,940
Krita is always talking about stuff

381
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:04,540
So wizard, I want to go back and ask what how how is it from somebody who who is not an artist?

382
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,860
Because I'm certainly not she's man stick figures

383
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:12,620
Yeah, so I mean I struggle with stick figures sometimes how is Krita when I sit down and you know

384
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:16,460
I'm looking at the I'm looking at the user interface. It actually looks you know

385
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:20,060
I guess fairly approachable. I mean there's an awful lot of tools and buttons

386
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:26,060
It is it's uh for for people that might have used, you know, proprietary software in the past

387
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:32,860
It's it's kind of a nice mix of you know, the Corel Draw of the past and uh, kind of photoshop of today

388
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:37,740
And it's and it's a good mix. It's not like uh, oh lord. Where why is this all messed up?

389
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:42,460
Why is everything everywhere else? Like you kind of get with GIMP and the best they don't mean that in a bad way, but

390
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:47,340
It's a very different from what you would expect it tends to take a little while to figure out

391
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:51,420
But it's it's kind of what you would expect where you expect things to be. It's like, oh, okay

392
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:56,700
Everything's fragile here along the left side. Oh, okay. Oh, there's the layering tool. There's this tool

393
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,940
Everything's where you would expect it to be

394
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:05,020
And it doesn't it doesn't take that learning curve like you need with GIMP where it's like, oh, okay

395
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:09,900
I see layers here. But you know, where is the patterns menu? Oh the patterns is behind it. It's a weird tab

396
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:14,140
You know and I I can speak, you know, they're apparently they're not here today

397
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:18,060
You know and I I can speak, you know, they're apparently they're not here to talk for themselves

398
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:21,820
but I I can tell you having talked to people like rotten corpse and people like odyssey westward that

399
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:27,260
You know, honestly restress told me on numerous occasions if it wasn't for projects like krita in my paint

400
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,020
He is a graphic designer would be on windows or mac

401
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:37,660
And so the important thing is even if you don't use tools like krita and I certainly don't I mean i'm i'm i'm

402
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,660
You guys probably have more art in your pinky finger than I have my whole body

403
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:44,220
I'm just not an artsy guy but uh

404
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:48,320
It's important to remember that these projects are fundamentally

405
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:55,660
Are are fundamental cornerstones to the people that are in that field and so uh, and I think it's a society like we

406
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,740
If someone wants to just get started

407
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:02,460
Maybe they're like in high school and they don't have money for professional software or they're just starting out in whatever

408
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:06,140
You know whatever age it's important for you to have free tools that are really

409
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:09,100
That can actually do what you want to do and let people be creative

410
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:13,520
Exactly exactly you you you you you lower that barrier to entry

411
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,080
And you take somebody that has that creative spirit and you give them professional grade tools and say here you go kid

412
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,040
Have some fun that you know, that can be a really empowering thing

413
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,320
Gentoo how many people use gentoo?

414
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:32,160
Uh, this again comes from soft pd headline the gentoo linux operating system has received an updated live dvd iso image dubbed choice edition

415
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:39,060
Which brings the latest gnu linux technologies according to the announcement gentoo linux choice edition live dvd has been released in celebration

416
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:45,520
Of the continued collaboration between gentoo developers and the community. It looks like it brings some of the latest software

417
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,200
releases such as the kde plasma 5.6 desktop environment

418
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,400
what

419
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,720
There's some sort of troll in the background folks

420
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,000
Um, so but how many people how many people are using yeah and zfs, right?

421
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,200
I was getting there uefi support and zfs on linux. How many people are using gentoo?

422
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,200
Is anyone using gentoo in the mumble room?

423
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,440
Have you used gentoo?

424
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,880
Yeah, I know a lot of x gentoo guys. Yeah, what are they on now?

425
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,520
tumbleweed

426
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,120
I've used it in the past. I don't have anything current. I've run it on a wee back in the day

427
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,120
That was a lot of fun. Mm-hmm

428
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,840
So chris and I were talking about doing a gentoo review have you heard about this?

429
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,120
Yeah, I I think you should I would also run if you guys are installing it on things

430
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,800
I would do it, too

431
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,840
That sounds like a blast

432
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:37,920
So the the fact that zfs on linux is becoming such a big thing and you can tell these early adopters things like arch

433
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,400
linux and things like gentoo, you know now

434
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:46,320
That tells you where the drive is for a given file system, right zfs is is a big deal

435
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,880
And what's funny is I still can't get it to work on abuntu

436
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,120
Yeah, I know that's funny

437
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,840
And I can kind of see gentoo as an interesting thing for like our container world

438
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:59,220
Like maybe you want to make yourself a really tiny minimal gentoo user land and since everything runs on x64

439
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,600
Virtualized things anyway, like the architecture doesn't matter as much and just run it like that

440
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,200
You know gentoo folks they are they're much like chris and his arch love, right?

441
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,240
They use it once they get hooked on that train. They use it for everything

442
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,120
And so i've got a really close friend of mine. He has it in his living room

443
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,240
It runs his projector his tv projector thing. It runs his media center and then for a living

444
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,080
He actually he hosts a website and he runs all of his

445
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:27,280
Uh all of his servers on gentoo as well because he becomes so familiar with it

446
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:27,760
Yeah

447
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,600
And the thing that he always says that he likes about it is that he can build that installation

448
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:37,280
To serve that given purpose in the living room. It's a media center in his in a server. It becomes his you know, his web server

449
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,960
um, and so I I think that it's important to get these

450
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,320
You know these features things like zfs that is going to fundamentally change how he can run it in on his server

451
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,160
Anyone in the mumble room have thoughts about zfs on on gentoo?

452
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:55,760
And not zfs on gentoo. How about zfs on linux in general or anything related to the current topic?

453
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:03,360
Does anybody know if they've actually got the zfs module compiled on that live cd or are they compiling it on the user's workstation?

454
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,080
You know, I don't know. Maybe if we do a gentoo review i'll be able to answer that for you

455
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,000
Yeah, because that that would actually be my question because you know

456
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,200
Ubuntu is going the way of having it pre-compiled and you're pulling it down and

457
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,640
Well other distros debbie and then I believe there's a couple others that are coming out and trying to do this dkms module

458
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,640
Which is built on the system. That'd be

459
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,680
That'd be an interesting way to see it. Like how are we doing this?

460
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:30,720
Are we doing it the nvidia way of compiling on the system that you're on or are you pulling down as a binary?

461
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,920
So in it for those of us like myself who are ignorant explain to me

462
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:43,220
Why that's important. Why does it matter if it's if I understand that that the the perception is that a dkms

463
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,700
Dks ms module is not going to be as

464
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,660
stable reliable

465
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:53,300
To start with the simple like I am not a lawyer thing but based on the free software

466
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:57,160
Uh the sff sff and software freedom conservancy

467
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:02,100
The the simple part is is basically with all this open source stuff

468
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:06,420
If you you know you as an individual user can do whatever the heck you want

469
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:11,240
But the gpl brings with it certain responsibilities for distributions

470
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,440
and so if a distribution is

471
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:21,400
Breaching the gpl the conditions of the gpl are very clear in this they can lose their right to distribute gpl

472
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,880
licensed software so

473
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:28,920
You know if you want to you know from a very narrow reading but you know, obviously ubuntu think otherwise

474
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,920
But you know ubuntu effectively are currently risking their right to ship gpl software. So

475
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,000
the

476
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:43,400
The you know, if you're just if you're doing like a debian or or you know, other others are ship the source

477
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,640
Users compile whatever the heck you want

478
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,600
That's generally seen as a loophole around all of that

479
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:54,840
But of course, yeah, if you know, how do you know it's going to compile properly?

480
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,520
How do you know it's going to work properly? There's more things to go wrong there because

481
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,000
Like your kernel is going to move

482
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,160
Then you need to make sure that's going to recompile properly blah blah. There are definitely more moving parts. That's for sure

483
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:10,360
Well, there are more moving parts. You know what? I like I like operating systems like centos and redhat that are predictable

484
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,080
And they just they have a nice even flow

485
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,520
You know what else I like I like when I can learn about those things

486
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:23,720
In a structured manner without having to guess and and and stab and search around the internet at places like linux academy

487
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:30,440
where I just got done doing my uh, my my redhat my redhat 7 training and now I realize that they are still releasing

488
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:35,160
Different versions of redhat 6 i'm thinking now I should go back because I still got a couple clients on 6

489
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,920
Maybe I need to go back and

490
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,280
Brush up on six skills

491
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:43,320
They still have the ability to I can still go take a course and brush up on that because now everything's changed

492
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:48,840
And I don't know about you west, but I have I have I fundamentally changed my behavior to

493
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,520
Everything is system d now, right? I go to stop a service system d

494
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:58,840
I go to start a service system d I go and enable like the whole check config to to enable something and service to start something

495
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:04,440
That my brain no longer works that way everything is I honestly it's it is until you go back to a six box

496
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,320
Then you're then it's not so great lost but you have linux academy to fall back on

497
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,680
So, uh linux academy is a great place to to go and learn about

498
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:18,040
Uh linux linux academy dot com slash unplugged and if you go to linux academy dot com slash unplugged

499
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:25,640
You can get a great uh, a great deal on signing up for linux and here chris has so kindly pulled up the redhat certified

500
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:31,160
engineer exam now if you're not familiar with the the the structure of certification in redhat

501
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:36,920
The first the entry level is the the csa the certified system administrator and then from there is the ce

502
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,600
which is the certified, uh engineer and then after that is the

503
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:45,720
Ca which is the certified architect and I don't remember exactly what the numbers are off the top of my head

504
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,800
But the last time I was talking with the redhat employee

505
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,760
He was there like they're like show shockingly low like the amount of certified architects in the world

506
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,320
like there's just there's a handful of them and like

507
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,540
I gotta tell you guys if you have one of these certifications

508
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,720
Maybe not so much the csa because that's kind of the entry level one

509
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,240
But definitely when you start approaching the ce and definitely if you get the ca

510
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:10,040
Man, you write your own ticket. That is a marketable skill to have because there are so few people

511
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,480
It's a lot of trust you can get yeah

512
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,400
And the other thing students, you know, it's gonna come with the you know

513
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:19,320
It's gonna come with a decent salary too because you know and and so and you can learn all of this stuff on linux academy

514
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,520
uh the uh

515
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,800
the uh

516
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:30,120
the the the the site is structured for people that are busy professionals that don't have a lot of time and

517
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:36,280
That has fundamentally enabled me to learn the things I need to learn it and again i'm comparing this

518
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:43,240
You know from from being going to a week-long class and now taking this class online at night. Yeah for sure. I think do

519
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:49,160
Uh for me, it's not even just about how busy I am. It's about how the how they break down the individual courseware

520
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,320
Yes, and so that I just look at that and I go okay. That's something I can accomplish. That's something I can do and

521
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:58,200
I no longer have this big nebulous question of this task. I want to complete

522
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:05,480
I have a very specific range of time. I need to commit and instructions and comprehensive study guides I can use and it's like, okay

523
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:09,800
I'm i'm ready for you to just pick that nugget and say i'm gonna i'm gonna tackle that nugget

524
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,480
I love that too. The nugget system is really cool

525
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,200
Like you just want to do a deep dive and they got availability planners, too

526
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,880
Just go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged to support the show

527
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,520
So, uh while i'm on the mic

528
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:25,560
Why don't I take over and start talking about something i've wanted to chat about for a little bit. It's the mycroft project now

529
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,800
Mr. Ryan was going to join us last week, but we got our wires crossed on timing

530
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,920
And that's actually sort of works out because there's something now

531
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:37,480
I want to talk about it's not directly related to the mycroft project, but it's sort of the power of open source

532
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,760
So let's get started by saying hey ryan. Welcome to linux unplugged

533
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,320
Hey, i'm glad to be back as always

534
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,200
Now I i'm assuming you saw this morning

535
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:53,400
This uh, super super cool gnome extension that brings mycroft for the desktop right into the gnome shell

536
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,120
Look at that. Yeah

537
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:02,040
It looks like it's professionally done. I mean, it's really really slick and this is just a great example of

538
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:07,560
What's one of the great benefits of having something like this be open source. So ryan what the heck what's new with the microsoft project?

539
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:12,920
There's a lot new. Um, so last week we released the code

540
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:17,560
Uh mycroft core, which is kind of the piece that ties it all together out to the

541
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:23,800
Open source community. Um, we know that it's an alpha. It's got a lot of bugs. We're going through and fixing them and

542
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,760
Honestly, you know once we put it out there

543
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,040
Immediately, you know, we got so much great feedback

544
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:36,280
But we also got like so many people trying it in so many new environments that now we're kind of just in crazy

545
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:43,560
Patching mode. So we'll be probably doing that for another week or two, you know, just trying to fix it all the bugs people found but uh,

546
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,920
So be ready for an alpha experience

547
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:51,400
But I encourage everybody to come play with it and even install this extension and provide feedback

548
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,040
this we it was so ironic because

549
00:40:54,600 --> 00:41:00,360
I was actually talking to a group and we have a we have a slack channel that you may can join you uh,

550
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,400
The documentation tells you how to do that

551
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:09,320
Um, but we were talking about start starting to make a gnome extension and then somebody linked me to this gnome extension

552
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,640
Oh, okay, and it was right before you pinged me on twitter

553
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:17,560
And so I learned about it just as we started talking about possibly talking about today, but it's awesome

554
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,520
It's freaking awesome, and i'm so happy to see it

555
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:27,000
So, uh, you seem like you've been pretty busy these days. How are how are things now in an open source project?

556
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,240
That's getting some attention like some interest from other parties. I have things

557
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,400
Do they feel like they've leveled up in difficulty for you?

558
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:38,920
Absolutely, absolutely leveled up in difficulty, but you know, the thing is

559
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:46,520
We're making jarvis an open source jarvis, you know, so it's we knew from the beginning. It wasn't going to be easy

560
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,600
and so, uh

561
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:55,320
As the project has grown I I actually we've hired four interns to help just manage all the little tasks good. Nice

562
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:59,640
And so, uh, we're we're also leveling up our account

563
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:05,480
We're also leveling up our capability to try and keep up with the the difficulty as things, you know

564
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,560
Increase but the cool thing is is we're in the right space, you know

565
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,360
Well, I would say it seems like there's a lot of attention here

566
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:15,160
I mean everyone's aware of google home just was announced

567
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,600
Of course, we don't know when it's going to ship yet

568
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:24,060
Everybody's familiar now with the amazon echo and the big rumor coming ahead of wwdc is third party api integration

569
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:28,680
With siri which apple seems to have directly linked to the information to put the word out there that

570
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:33,560
Third party integration is coming to siri. So it would seem every major player and then of course, let's not forget

571
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,720
Microsoft has that adorable cortana as well

572
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:41,160
You ever wonder if they see like this type of movement in the open source community?

573
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:45,000
And adjust accordingly, you know, you see like parsi mac parser

574
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:49,320
you know get released and you ever wonder if they they see like

575
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,160
uh

576
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:54,840
A project like adapt our intent parser get dropped out there and they're like, oh, well

577
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:59,640
We don't want a whole bunch of people adopting that, you know, so let's let's put something else out there

578
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,720
That ties kind of people into to our, you know ecosystem

579
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,240
So, I mean it's all great

580
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:11,100
We're making use of everything that these guys drop, you know and and evaluating them and seeing how they can improve microsoft

581
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,880
But it's just and it's great. It's great

582
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,800
That's what this whole point of this project was was to introduce an open source alternative

583
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:25,640
You know into the into the environment and to give people like us a chance to integrate this stuff into

584
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,360
you know, for instance gnome, yeah, we're

585
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,360
We're not going to be able to necessarily grab, you know

586
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:39,080
Cortana or would we really even want to like and integrate that into our linux desktops and into

587
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,360
You know these various random devices around our home

588
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:48,200
and so that's the whole point since the beginning was to provide a platform to enable people to do that and

589
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:55,240
You know just last week we we finished tech stars, which is an accelerator. It's like y combinator

590
00:43:55,240 --> 00:44:00,200
it's one of the big accelerators in the nation and that was powered by tech stars and sprint and

591
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,440
We got a lot of value out of that

592
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:08,760
But uh, you were asking about a video and I totally forgot that uh, josh's keynote was recorded there

593
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:12,120
And he talks about how open source has you know?

594
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:17,400
Rose to the occasion to rule like mobile and the desktop and how you know

595
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:23,080
This is just another space where it makes sense when you have this ubiquitous technology. That's going to be everywhere

596
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,000
What about to have it be open?

597
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:25,720
So okay

598
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,120
I follow you there ryan and I agree this is

599
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,880
And fundamentally an area that we have to have a great solid open source solution to

600
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:39,420
What about that ecosystem though? Like what makes google home attractive is that it ties in with the entire google ecosystem?

601
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:45,320
And all of the third parties that will integrate with it simply because google is a name that gets their respect

602
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,400
And so they're just so they'll work with google

603
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:53,320
Um, how do you compete when it seems like that is going to be one of the larger feature sets of these devices?

604
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,800
good question, so

605
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,120
the answer is that

606
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,920
uh, we don't you know the the answer is that

607
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,880
That sure you can have a google home device

608
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:10,280
That's this black box, you know that that you talk to but what about voice enabling? You know your oven?

609
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,400
What about voice enabling? You know the random?

610
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:17,480
Internet of things that are around your house or the new device that you create

611
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:21,400
Yeah, you we don't have we're looking at this all you're looking at this all wrong

612
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:28,040
It's it's what we're what what microsoft gives us an opportunity to do is to make voice command ubiquitous

613
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:34,120
Throughout the house, you know to to it doesn't have to be we we keep pushing down

614
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:40,840
What this stack can run on and the idea is to get it on the smallest micro processor possible?

615
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:47,400
So that your garage door opener can be voice enabled, you know, that's the goal and and to make voice

616
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:52,280
Be everywhere, you know and and uh, do you need to talk to your microwave?

617
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:59,240
Not necessarily, but it'd be freaking awesome if you could you know, uh same with the oven preheat to 375 degrees

618
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:04,360
And set a timer for 10 minutes, you know, this is something that I don't necessarily see

619
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,680
um people

620
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:14,520
I don't see people adopting google and echo and amazon solution simply because if i'm ge and i'm

621
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:19,720
Installing, you know one of those stacks if if they come available to where you can do this

622
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:25,800
If i'm installing it on an oven, I now my relationship with my customer is shared with amazon

623
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:29,160
You know and everything they say is going to be hoovered up by amazon

624
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:34,920
And it's the same with like a sonos speaker or a bose speaker if you were to put amazon's

625
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:39,880
You know technology on that speaker if you ask the speaker. What's the best speaker in the world? What is it going to say chris?

626
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,560
Is going to say the amazon echo. That's right

627
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:50,360
That's right. And so amazon like, you know, I know that that you can load amazon, uh the echo

628
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,960
software onto raspberry pi, but the the question is

629
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:59,560
Do you want that relationship with amazon to permeate everywhere? It's like when you ask siri

630
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:05,880
What's the best smartphone siri says the iphone of course, uh, you know boy it's so it's it's bigger than any one device

631
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,960
That's for sure. And it's it's

632
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:12,120
It's almost the raspberry pi of ai and voice

633
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:15,800
Where you can you can build it into anything and then give that all of a sudden

634
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:16,920
There's lots of devices out there

635
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,880
But the raspberry pi is when everybody knows you take a device like this and all of a sudden

636
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:25,160
You can put a computing you can put a computer in something that was never possible to have a computer at a price point never

637
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:31,160
Possible before yeah, and the thing is this is the big thing for years and years and years. We thought the most

638
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:35,160
Innovative way to talk to your computer was to point and grunt

639
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:40,280
And now we're at a point where that computers can understand what you're saying

640
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:44,440
And they can understand natural language and respond to that and that's powerful

641
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:49,240
You know that's going to change what we perceive to be computers

642
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:54,680
And what can be a computer because we they you need a speaker and a microphone in this case

643
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,760
And then you can have a conversation with this device and make it do what you want it to do

644
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:03,400
Wizard jet actually has a good use case for talking to your oven go ahead wizard

645
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:08,360
Yeah, you know, uh when everyone goes out and they realize oh I left my oven on you

646
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:12,440
You can actually go down and ask your phone. Oh, did I leave the oven on? Hey my craft?

647
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,160
Yeah, I try it

648
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:25,080
so the so some things that I i've been waiting to tell your audience, you know is is uh, we would we we've seen a

649
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,520
Successful funding around

650
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:34,120
So we'll have more details on that soon, which means that we're we're in this for the long haul

651
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:35,880
and uh

652
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:42,520
And we're going to be working with every community that will work with us to try to get the microsoft core

653
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:49,980
To permeate, you know throughout open source projects that you know, be it applications or or desktops

654
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:56,220
Or or anything, you know, I I used home assistant the other day home assistant.io

655
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,760
Which is a really cool project

656
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:03,480
And I noticed that they used you know, some really simple google speech to text

657
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,640
to do

658
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:11,820
Pretty simple commands and this is another place where you know microsoft might be able to help extend that capability

659
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:19,080
And so if you're if you're involved in a project that you think could benefit from voice, you know enablement

660
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:23,400
um, please come over and hang out with us and talk with us because

661
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:27,720
This is this is something that where we don't have to be behind this time

662
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:28,440
I mean

663
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:32,440
We're we might be a little behind as far as like if we're talking about the desktop

664
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:38,360
because windows 10 has had cortana for a little while but but there's now an option and the only thing holding it back

665
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:43,400
Is getting you know people contributing and porting it over to the different desktops and

666
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:47,400
And making sure that it's easy to use and enable and we saw that with the gnome extension

667
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:51,160
But unfortunately, there's just not enough people on the team to be an expert

668
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,840
In how to integrate into each of the desktop environments

669
00:49:55,160 --> 00:50:01,400
So i'd love to see you know this permeate as an option for people who want to voice enable their their

670
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:07,960
Uh desktop and and maybe even their linux powered phone and i'm looking at poppy

671
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:11,560
Even though i'm sure he's not listening right now, but i'm but i'm looking at him

672
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:19,000
So uh stereo blow you made a you made a comment in the chat room about the importance of some sort of

673
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,440
Open dictation system something like that. Could you expand on that a little bit?

674
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:30,680
Yeah, i'm not sure if people have tried to use a dictation on linux, but it's not that easy to get a

675
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:33,080
uh working uh dictation

676
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:37,160
uh going I mean you have the option of using something like

677
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,840
um dragon naturally speaking or something

678
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,960
but uh having a open

679
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:48,840
Dictation technology would be just great on linux. Mm-hmm

680
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:54,920
I like the idea too of all of these really interesting chat applications that are coming out now like you have

681
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:59,480
A silent circle and of course telegram and all these could use

682
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:06,620
Is they're working on early versions of bots, but wouldn't it be interesting to see them integrate some sort of micro functionality

683
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,000
Yes, that would be very cool

684
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,360
So it's kind of like the perfect time to be the plumbing of this kind of stuff because there's a lot of stuff in development

685
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,920
Want it and if we have like a really good friendly

686
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,640
Open source upstream. That's awesome

687
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:24,120
And it sounds like you guys will be a good horse to bet on it with the funding going successfully

688
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,200
It'll be around for a while. So that's good news, too

689
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:32,360
Yeah, and the other thing is you know one thing that holds us back in the in the keep that the jupiter broadcasting community can

690
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:40,280
Help with is we just need people to test on all different mics, you know, unfortunately, uh, we found some people whose laptop

691
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,680
Mics give them a really really difficult time

692
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:49,720
But that's great information to have and that's great information to take and and try to adjust the experience work

693
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:56,140
Everywhere, you know and we can only get that like we're not an enormous company. We don't have uh, you know

694
00:51:56,220 --> 00:52:00,220
20 million dollars and 100 engineers to throw at throughout a problem

695
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:04,780
So the best thing that people can do for us is to come over and provide us with feedback

696
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:06,860
And we're not perfect and we're not going to be perfect

697
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:10,380
You know, we're not it's going to be it's it's rough to do what we're doing

698
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:16,060
But the the best way to accelerate that process is to get feedback and and contributions

699
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:20,060
And so, um, I probably say the same thing every time but you know

700
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:25,180
We could really use the help of the open source community to help us kind of drive development and drive testing

701
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:31,980
So if people are if people have time and they want to contribute to a project we could really use the uh, the eyeballs

702
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:37,660
In the in the hands. Yeah, excellent. Thanks ryan. I think that would be really that's probably uh, you're helping out with the mics

703
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:40,140
That's something anybody can do without any development skills, uh swift

704
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:43,020
You had a you had something you want to mention regarding simon real quick as we wrap up

705
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:49,740
Yeah, I was going to talk about that. You can use that as dictation software. Yeah, it's not the prettiest in the world

706
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:56,380
But it is nice. Yeah something for people to look into so ryan. Well, thank you for stopping by and uh, giving us an update

707
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,860
It's a project. We've been following for a while here on the show and we can

708
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:02,380
I continue to find every single time we talk fascinating

709
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:09,580
So yeah, i'm I hope to uh, I still hope to head over your way and hook up. Uh, lady jupiter that would be amazing

710
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:12,540
We'll make it worth your time. Yeah

711
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:16,060
Okay. All right. I'll help you do that. Lady jupiter knows how to party. That is a great

712
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:20,700
As linux fest can attest, uh, so before we go any further speaking a party, you know

713
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:23,900
It's a party for your pocketbook ting go right there to go

714
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:28,540
So get yourself just a great cellular plan go to linux.ting.com to get our discount and support the show

715
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:34,620
It's your own terms wireless. So they got cdma and gsm you get to pick from which is dead simple

716
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:37,740
Which means if you have a better gsm signal in your area

717
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:40,620
Switch over to that if you have better cdma signal you can switch over to that

718
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:43,660
You're gonna get that. I love that flexibility. I love also

719
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:46,780
Well, I suppose what I really love about it is it's six dollars for the line

720
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:50,620
And then it's just your usage on top of that. That's the brilliance. That's where it's just simple and straightforward

721
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:52,620
It's how wireless should have been from the beginning

722
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:54,540
No contract

723
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:58,940
No other termination fee. No, you go to linux.ting.com you get 25 off your first device

724
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:03,340
If you got a compatible device and you might you get 25 in service credit

725
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:07,420
Now the average ting bill for per line is like 23 bucks

726
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:11,500
They're doing a giveaway of the anzatel one touch idol 3, which is a pretty decent

727
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:19,180
Freaking gsm 4.7 inch and 5.5 inch. Oh nice. Yeah android phone. I know so we got details on their blog

728
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:24,380
Right now you beat free. You can't be free wess. You can't beat free phone and then that ting service

729
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:26,140
You're paying nothing nine dollars for a sim

730
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:31,340
If you just need a sim card, uh, then they have great devices including the volt 2 for 66 bucks

731
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:35,820
If you're just looking for a nice android phone to just make calls and stuff. That's or do like telegram, right?

732
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:39,580
It perfect the netgear zings back in stock. That's great. That's great

733
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:44,060
They also have the uh, the old nexus 5 if you want something for under 200 bucks

734
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:45,580
That is a google experience phone

735
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:49,260
And of course, I got the 5x and the 6p and the internet phones and the samsung phones and all of them

736
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:55,100
Yeah, they got them all you go to linux.ting.com go there. Try them out. Like I said, there's no contract

737
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:58,780
There's no other termination fee. There's really no risk. They have a savings calculator right here

738
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:01,980
You go there you plug it in you see how much you would save and you know what wess

739
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:05,020
Girl, you're gonna save

740
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:09,660
So much wess. I can't okay. I can't wess. I can't you just have to go there for me

741
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:13,660
Yes, I can't linux.ting.com. You got to go there and try it out

742
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:16,780
See what i've been talking about that supports the show looking at what they got

743
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:21,900
Reading their blog learning more about the company maybe doing their savings calculator all of that's a way to support the show

744
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:27,340
And maybe save yourself some money. It's a great service. I've been I mean i'm like two and a half years now or something

745
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:30,800
Because it's almost freaking june which is crazy linux.ting.com

746
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,800
Linux.ting.com

747
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:37,760
So wess, uh, I don't know if the does the mumble room know that we asked you to sacrifice your laptop once again

748
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,840
I'm, not sure we did talk about it pre-show

749
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:40,800
Yeah

750
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:46,160
So, uh, i'll bring i'll bring the brown bear back in for this segment because I know he might have more interest in this

751
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:49,680
Than I do, but I I will confess I was the one that asked you

752
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:55,760
To do this. That's true. And you've actually gotten sacrifice. You've gotten remarkably further than I expected

753
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:59,440
Uh, I am I am damn impressed when I looked over at your machine and saw what you've been up to

754
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:05,840
So ladies and gentlemen, uh, we asked wess for the good of the virtual lug and our audience

755
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:11,120
Take a look at what might be a desktop linux competitor someday

756
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:17,940
Remix os for the pc. What is it wess? Well, it's a combination of remix os and android x86

757
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:24,960
Uh, and it's android on your laptop. Oh, that's what i'm running it on here anyway, and it's a it's kind of like a

758
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,120
It's like a regular desktop experience

759
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:32,880
Uh, maybe like a little windows 10 ish, but they've got like a pseudo desktop with like your android icons. It doesn't

760
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,080
It comes with like a guest mode

761
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:40,000
So you can start out and you can just run it like a you can burn it to a cd or a usb

762
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:45,680
And then run it in guest mode and it'll just be like a regular live cd without persistence or they have the uh, a resident mode

763
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:50,720
They call it where it will make itself like a little loopback image file and and write on there

764
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,680
So that's what i've been doing i put it on a usb drive and edited grub

765
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:57,760
And had to do a little futzing with grub that maybe that's my fault. Maybe that's their fault

766
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:03,360
You know, it's hard to say but i've got it running and it doesn't come with play services

767
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:07,600
But play services they have like a easy install for play services that took I don't know a minute

768
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:12,000
You just reboot and then the play store was there. So i've been able to install telegram. I've got slack

769
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,640
I've got google drive you did you got all those up?

770
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,880
There have been some couple caveats like google drive

771
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,960
I I can download the show notes as a pdf

772
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:22,800
I have not been able to get it to actually show me the show notes and be able to edit them

773
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:27,520
Uh, but telegram works slacks working great do this for me if you don't mind

774
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:32,160
Can you look and see if any what go pay is on there and here's and here's here's why I say that

775
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,920
We have a payment solution for for for the you know

776
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:40,720
So we do we we offer services in some weird places and i'm i'm an entrepreneur, right?

777
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:44,960
So I never tell somebody no so somebody calls me and says yeah, see if that installs and runs

778
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,360
Somebody calls me and says will you come service me at my rv or?

779
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:53,280
Or in the middle of a park in the middle of a parking lot or where some other weird places we've done

780
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:57,440
Somewhere you'll be able to get this right? Yeah, I have no problem going out there and doing service

781
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:01,760
The problem is billing somebody that I met in a parking lot or billing somebody at their rv

782
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,600
That poses a challenge. I'll send you an invoice. Yeah, right

783
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,080
And so and you know my my front desk staff they get you know

784
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:12,880
They get all hot and bothered anytime something isn't like laid out for them. And so one of the only in a foreign language

785
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:17,760
No, no, no, it's it's normally in it's normally in it's normally in english

786
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,600
uh

787
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:25,680
Yikes, okay. All right. Well, but it might work. Maybe we have to change the user agent or is that a thing?

788
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,160
The thing is though

789
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:31,280
I hate using tablets for that kind of stuff

790
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,800
It would be much more convenient if they could just boot into a vm

791
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,840
Type in the credit card number run it that way

792
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,280
and um

793
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:43,280
And so this kind of thing is not it's really not my wheelhouse, right?

794
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:48,560
like so for one I have a hard time really getting behind wanting to run android on a

795
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,600
Taking a perfectly good usable laptop and then running

796
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,240
android on it

797
00:58:54,320 --> 00:59:00,320
No, I feel yeah, I mean I I don't think i'll keep it and it is like android is it's okay on my phone

798
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,960
It works on the phone, but it's not perfect

799
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:07,600
Well where I do see a lot of value coming in is there is in any way go pay is one example

800
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,280
But I think there are others

801
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:14,400
There are a lot of applications that are not written for linux, but they are available on the play store, right?

802
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:18,480
Absolutely, and so the ability to have to be able to run those applications

803
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:21,520
Especially if I can virtualize if I can get it to run in a virtual box man

804
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:25,360
Now we're cooking with gas in the front right burner. I I you know, the you know

805
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:29,360
What go pay isn't even available. It's not a windows app. It's not available on macOS

806
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:33,920
Yeah, it is only available in ios or android and and you're seeing that more and more

807
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,800
There's a lot of applications that are only available

808
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:42,000
Inside of a mobile atmosphere and so and as a person who wants to use a desktop for everything

809
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:45,760
There is I I think that there is a lot of value to be had in

810
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:49,840
Being able to virtualize that stuff and being able to run that on my laptop. Totally

811
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:54,960
Now how have you have you run any intensive applications something like plex?

812
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:59,680
Or any sort of game? I do have plex installed. I've not tried actually watching it yet

813
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,600
I maybe I can get youtube going though

814
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:07,760
I will say it has been nicely integrated like my function keys for brightness and sound those are working right out of the box

815
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:12,960
No kidding. I mean it hasn't been slow. It seems to be compositing and accelerated wi-fi seems to work

816
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:17,760
Okay, wi-fi was there like in the installer process like no since then it's been just perfect

817
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:22,000
you know a lot of this leads me to wonder the direction that google is traveling and I I

818
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:29,440
I would not be at all surprised if in if in 10 years when you buy a macbook pro it's running ios and when you

819
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,440
buy a

820
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,600
A chromebook it's running android

821
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,800
I think that you know as these companies continue to invest more and more money and time and effort and

822
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:42,560
Into their mobile operating system and as companies start to develop apps

823
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:48,960
And put their infrastructure in you know a mobile atmosphere. In fact, I was doing contracting for a company just last week

824
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,520
And they had an app that I had to send all of the information into them

825
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:58,240
Right was not available from web browser could not do it from a desktop had to be done on a smartphone

826
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,960
In fact, they actually told me when you know when we were negotiating the contract out

827
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:05,120
They said, you know, we want a subcontract we want you to do xyz and we need you to

828
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:12,320
Use our app because that's how we it's actually it's honestly was kind of creepy because they they actually they could take control of the webcam

829
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:16,080
so they and the microphone so that they could see what was going on and

830
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,720
Again, this brings me back to

831
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:22,080
I think it would be really useful to be able to virtualize something like that

832
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:28,160
And have something like that available to me so that I can you know, I can complete the the assignment

833
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,160
But at the end of the day, then I can shut it down

834
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,480
I know and heck i'm installing that on my phone, right?

835
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:36,000
It just so happens that I happen to have an android tablet that I don't really like and didn't really want

836
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,840
Right, right. And so I you know, I just I load it on there

837
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:43,360
In fact, I have a google account specifically for things. They don't want to use but well youtube

838
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:46,960
Wow

839
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,320
And that's surprising playbook

840
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:53,760
I I don't know if you can hold that up to the the camera and they they can see the playback is remarkably smooth

841
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,440
If you can't see that

842
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,720
Yeah, i'd have to hear it with sound to know if you know, it's syncing up and stuff like that

843
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:01,120
So we'd have to maybe look at that a little bit closer

844
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:06,640
But based on what i'm seeing here, I think that's I think that's great performance and you know, the thing is really

845
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:11,760
What is that a core i5? Yeah, so I mean it's got like way more hardware

846
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,640
A little less ram than I should be proud of

847
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:19,280
So, you know, I I think that there's a lot of use cases mumble room do you guys

848
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:22,240
Uh, what do you guys think about running android on a laptop?

849
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,960
I would run it in a vm. Okay depressing

850
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:30,960
Depressing why why is it depressing? I'll do it in a vm as well

851
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,480
so

852
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:39,520
Now i'm gonna run, you know, all of these other os's in my laptop or in my computer. It's like well

853
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:45,280
It's like well, i'm gonna have all these off-baked experiences because nobody actually targets

854
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:48,000
The thing that i'm using

855
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,960
right, i'll just keep letting layers so that I have

856
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:55,200
um crappy experience on my laptop supporting these

857
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:58,560
Half-baked infrastructures. Mm-hmm. No, thank you

858
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:02,400
Now you say that you say that as a developer or as an end user?

859
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,320
both

860
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:09,440
Okay, right as a developer. I don't want to target a thousand platforms. I want people to adopt one thing

861
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,960
But at the same time, um as a user I look at it's like

862
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:18,480
I'm if I support these type of things these will become of uh incentive for developers, right?

863
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,040
and no

864
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:22,400
Okay

865
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:29,360
I you know, I I how about outside of just uh, how about outside of of development or sandboxing security concerns?

866
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,440
Does anyone see this as being like?

867
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,440
Man, you know, I would use linux more if there were just more apps available

868
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:39,840
So now this really enables me to do that and i'm going to blow away my linux installers anyone thinking that route

869
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43,280
I'm not i'm thinking the users might be like that

870
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:48,800
I'm actually thinking I already explained to my I know

871
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:53,680
Grandmother my father how to use android phone now

872
01:03:53,680 --> 01:04:00,800
Now I don't have to explain the same thing to them again how to you know use uh google docs

873
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,760
on their computer because the experience

874
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:12,000
Is the same if I use remix os or a similar android pc thing, right? So they they have one

875
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:17,840
Sort of device in their pocket and the same experience on their desktop

876
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:22,800
It could be used for for users like that who are not power users

877
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,000
um

878
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,880
They just want to streamline the experience everywhere, right?

879
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:32,960
You know what non-power users should just relegate themselves to alexa google now and things like that

880
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,080
Not actually touch the machine and uh one thing or not

881
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,080
These will actually save us

882
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:41,280
And then we can actually focus on getting linux as a platform

883
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:47,040
Which if you think about it works on windows on linux in solaris in bsd

884
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:52,640
And android is based on it. So why don't we just rip android and keep the linux layer?

885
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:56,640
Which actually is what we need so that binaries work target that platform instead

886
01:04:57,120 --> 01:05:01,920
Actually runs everywhere already. I find this. Uh, well, okay a couple of things about this that strike me is kind of nice

887
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:05,360
First of all nice or not. It definitely looks a lot like windows 10

888
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:11,840
But what I really think they've done right is the window controls the window border so you can use the android apps in a windowed environment

889
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:19,280
The window borders match the header color of the application. So it really looks nice. Yeah, it looks it looks like those

890
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:25,120
Applications are meant to be borderless windows and now that even desktop environments are dropping scroll bars

891
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:29,040
It doesn't look that weird to have an application with no scroll bars. It just looks like

892
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:34,480
A desktop app. I mean when you look at that, I wouldn't even know those are necessarily android apps, right? Yeah

893
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,880
Yeah, no for sure. It you know

894
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,600
And I think as that line gets blurred

895
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:42,320
I I see that as kind of a problem to be honest with you

896
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:46,080
I mean it it's great from the from the familiarity standpoint the press was saying, you know

897
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:50,880
how you know, you can show your parents to use this and the other but the thing I do get a little bit concerned about is

898
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:55,520
I like my desktop. I like I like my desktop operating system

899
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:58,640
And and it seems like every day we take steps to make

900
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:02,480
The desktop a little bit less relevant and mobile a little bit more relevant

901
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,880
And it seems like this is one more step in that direction

902
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:06,480
No, no

903
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:11,360
No in that case would gb more comfortable with running something like chrome os where you can run android apps

904
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,240
But you're keeping a more stock linux experience under the hood

905
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:18,640
You know, I feel like chrome os is the closest i've I have gotten

906
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,760
to uh to mainstream linux

907
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,560
That I could live with but it misses the beat

908
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:26,800
I mean we discussed this on linux action show a couple weeks ago

909
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:31,440
it misses the beat because one is we start to fall into this fallacy of

910
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:34,560
our team's winning rather than

911
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:41,200
We actually have a good solution chrome os. Let's face it is really not a whole lot better than mac os or windows

912
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,760
It technically has a linux kernel

913
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:46,320
And it technically has a linux shell

914
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:49,680
And that's pretty much where it ends and then

915
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:54,880
We're stuck. I mean I can't install gimp. I can't install inkscape. I can't install libreoffice

916
01:06:54,960 --> 01:07:01,120
I can't install I mean all of the things that I want to do with a linux installation feel like a traditional linux desktop

917
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:05,120
Linux desktop, right and all the freedoms that come with a linux desktop and all the you know

918
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:09,680
And the other thing is too is and i've said this before on the air and it is worth repeating because it applies to both

919
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,960
Chrome os and it applies to android on a laptop

920
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:21,120
I don't fundamentally trust those operating systems. And so I will not put highly sensitive information pictures videos documents, whatever

921
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:25,280
on a chrome os laptop or on a

922
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,880
Or on an android laptop and you know actually and to second that

923
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:32,320
All of those important files are encrypted with lux and I don't know about you

924
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:34,320
But I haven't really found a way to get lux to work

925
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:38,640
On chrome os or on android. I have not tried but uh, you're right

926
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:42,080
it's just

927
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,480
As far as the um

928
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:48,880
thing you mentioned earlier that um, you

929
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,680
still want your uh

930
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:59,120
Classic desktop experience and you don't want that mobile thing to take over that battle is already lost. Uh,

931
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:01,600
I think two or three years ago. I talked to uh,

932
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:05,200
Uh, I think he was a backend developer at tablo

933
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:10,100
Okay, and he said their user base is growing and it's growing steadily

934
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,800
But the desktop user base

935
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:18,080
Is stagnant all the new users that come in are phone and tablet users

936
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:21,360
So this is the next generation

937
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:23,360
well

938
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:30,160
It's a growth trend that just continues in that direction, right? So the next generation of consumers are all

939
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:33,760
People who want that mobile experience. Well, I have to be honest with you

940
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:35,520
I'm, really hoping what that means

941
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:40,880
is that it opens up a void in the desktop space and allows linux to take more of a foothold because I think that

942
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:46,480
I think that windows has been dying a slow death for a long time and I I I

943
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:52,080
I continue to hold that hope that that mac os really isn't making any serious headway into the desktop space

944
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:56,880
Uh, and so, you know, they're you know, really their their eggs are, you know a lot in mobile as well

945
01:08:57,280 --> 01:09:02,080
Um, so hopefully they just it kind of leaves that void and you know a lot of people do that a lot of people are

946
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:07,200
You know, they see laptop and desktops as the old generation the old way of doing things

947
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:11,440
Um, and if that's the case great leave that kind of stuff to me and that's what my generation

948
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:15,040
Maybe there are different types of people where like you just don't need it and okay

949
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:19,120
That's fine and you can zoom and create to the level that you can on those devices

950
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,520
Well chris said it best when we were at system 76

951
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:26,560
He goes yeah tablet living works great and mobile living works great until you need to get real work done. Then you need a laptop

952
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:31,760
Um, so it is what it is. Hey guys, then you buy an ipad pro

953
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:38,160
Yeah, which doesn't have a key which doesn't have a keyboard and is really more of a tablet and runs ios and so that's you know

954
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:42,400
You have these new microsoft tablets the surface book, you know

955
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:45,280
Yeah, i've tried getting linux to run on those those I haven't you know

956
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:49,040
Had much of a chance to get that to work well either. Hey guys, you know

957
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,720
One of the things that I uh, I come here every time I come here

958
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:58,320
I i'm excited to work with chris and i'm excited to meet up with rikai and have a chance to chat with wess and whatnot

959
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,440
but

960
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:02,720
The other thing I always try to look at is what is the network doing?

961
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:06,560
What changes is the network making what direction is the network growing?

962
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:09,200
And as a you know as a person on the outside

963
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:14,320
I always thought I kind of had a decent idea because I think chris does a really good job of keeping people up to date

964
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:23,520
but he he has been working night and day for the you know months to make some of these fundamental changes possible like the

965
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:29,920
Streaming services there are streaming servers that are going out to the different services and providing you guys with an uncut feed

966
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:31,760
of

967
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,720
All of the shows here and that's huge. Yeah, it's huge

968
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:39,680
but the the thing that I think often gets overlooked is a lot of people are great at doing addition on the internet and

969
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:43,200
Not so great at doing subtraction and the reality is that there's a cost associated with that, right?

970
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:46,000
When he is when he is paying rikai

971
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:51,440
To you know to to work on all of this stuff or when he's having me do all this stuff when he's having other

972
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:57,680
People come in and you know and try to get all this infrastructure not to mention actually pay for the physical infrastructure itself

973
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,440
And let me tell you

974
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:04,720
I mean I was here I watched firsthand how carefully he was counting

975
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:10,000
Costs trying to make every single penny count because we had to stretch it as far as humanly possible to make this possible

976
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,400
And then you get to the end of it and it's like well

977
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:15,600
We still aren't going to be able to make this work quite the way we really want it to well

978
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:20,640
We'll find a way we're gonna we're gonna shoehorn this we're gonna shoehorn that or we're gonna we'll we'll outsource this and thank god

979
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:25,360
we have you know resources like digital ocean that allow us to expand that but

980
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:31,460
I see so many people that they will pay for a ten dollar netflix subscription

981
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,640
My in-laws and I was showing chris the text this earlier

982
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:39,680
My in-laws have a netflix subscription that they don't use they pay every month for a netflix subscription

983
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:43,760
But because they bought one of these smart tvs that turned out to be outdated like in six months

984
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:48,080
By the way, I I think I did mention this to them like six months ago when they bought it

985
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:50,480
I imagine like I was like, you know smart tv not a great choice

986
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:54,640
And so the smart tv goes out of date and so this netflix app isn't working and I don't know

987
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:57,280
Working and I find out about this and i'm like, well, you know, you could buy

988
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,560
You know one of the little streaming sticks or whatever and stick in there and i'm explaining this to my in-laws and then it dawns

989
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,560
On me they are paying ten dollars a month

990
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:09,600
For content that they don't even watch right and don't touch and the reason for that is well

991
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:13,920
I think it's a couple fold one is I think they they buy into the netflix experience

992
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,400
They buy into the netflix desire that they have access to this on-demand content in the back of your mind

993
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:23,200
You know, you can watch it whenever you want exactly you never do exactly and and then second of all

994
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:27,360
It's they put it on you know, you put it on automatic, you know draft or whatever and you just forget about it

995
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:35,200
So I guess what i'm asking you guys to do is why not do that for jb the people here

996
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:37,200
I promise you the people in this building

997
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:42,400
Are working twice as hard than most of the people at netflix to bring you content and the thing is we don't restrict the content

998
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:47,600
We give it to you in labor respecting formats. We give it to you in the the the most common formats

999
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:51,360
You just you you download it and we don't even charge you for I mean you go to the website

1000
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:57,120
You just download it and all we're asking in return is that if you appreciate the content if you like what we do here

1001
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:59,680
You know, I used to have a friend he used to say

1002
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:06,000
Gratuitous, uh, it was uh rabbi lapin. He used to say, um

1003
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:09,020
gratuity is

1004
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:13,600
Is what you give people with president's faces on them and their tokens of appreciation, right?

1005
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:17,920
And and you know, there are so many different levels that you can contribute now

1006
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:23,120
um, you know i'm looking here you can get started at three bucks three bucks a month and

1007
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,440
That's a great way to say. Thank you

1008
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:28,320
And the thing is like I think a lot of people fall into this they say well

1009
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:30,720
I don't know if I you know, I don't know if that really does anything

1010
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:35,440
You know, the reality is if everyone that said that just signed up for three bucks a month

1011
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:37,920
Which by the way is a third of the cost of netflix

1012
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:42,160
So if you think about it, you're you're getting it at like 66 percent discount nothing

1013
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:44,640
Yeah, exactly and it it does a lot

1014
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:48,880
Of course if you can afford to help more than you know, and people do we get emails in all the time

1015
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,680
And you know, we don't always read them because it's quite frankly

1016
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:54,800
There's no good content weight to read flattering emails sometimes

1017
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:58,720
But there's a lot of people that have said the network has helped them get a new linux job

1018
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:04,240
The network has helped them, you know double their income because absolutely, you know, they're now working in a different field

1019
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:08,420
So I would just encourage you guys if you like the content we're producing here go over to patreon.com

1020
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:11,760
And sign up to be a patron

1021
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:14,800
If this became a wider spread thing

1022
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:20,880
If more people were involved in the patreon and putting their voting with their their money

1023
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:26,160
Chris and the entire network becomes beholden to them and them alone

1024
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:31,920
And so really you are you are you're not only saying thank you. You're not only saying

1025
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:38,320
Uh, we hear we see the content that you're doing. We appreciate the content that you're doing and we thank you, but you're also

1026
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,960
You're also buying a piece of power, right?

1027
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:44,720
You're also buying that that little bit of this is what I want to see done

1028
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,960
And you know, we try and listen to that. So we're at

1029
01:14:48,380 --> 01:14:50,400
3981 now every time that i've been here

1030
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,960
I kind of have i'm starting to get a record like if I come here

1031
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:57,200
And I and I make some ridiculous promise then something ridiculous happens, right?

1032
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:03,120
Right. I I don't know what I mean. I wore a window shirt. I mean, what else do you want from me? You know

1033
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:09,040
Uh, but I think it would be super cool if we could get to 4 000 patrons now that is

1034
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:14,480
That is what 19 patrons. It just had 19 people 19 people sign up

1035
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:18,720
We'd have like four that's a really nice that is doesn't that have a nice ring to it really does

1036
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,240
It has a nice ring to it

1037
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:23,120
I think that that would go over I I think then chris would be like

1038
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:29,200
No one west do not totally screw up the show when we let them do it and then and then our beatings are way less

1039
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:33,840
Severe they are they are he doesn't get nearly as he doesn't get nearly as as as upset with us

1040
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:38,800
And we might even get to eat tonight. Yeah, if only we could get 19 patrons. So let's try to make that a goal

1041
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:42,500
Let's see 19 patrons. We get 19 people to sign up for patreon.com

1042
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:44,960
slash today

1043
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:49,760
I'll have to think of something. I don't know what I again I just you know a window shirt. I don't know

1044
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:51,680
What else am I gonna do?

1045
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,680
um windows tattoo

1046
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:58,720
To that ain't gonna happen too far 10 000 patrons. It's not no it's not gonna happen

1047
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:01,700
Like even if they were my patrons, I know patreon.com

1048
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:05,440
Today anyone else in the mumble room have any closing thoughts?

1049
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:11,600
Not necessarily about patreon but just about linux in general you guys come on now

1050
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:16,960
We are

1051
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:22,720
You what? Yeah, I guess so I guess everything has

1052
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:28,640
Either we have gone through and said everything humanly possible or everyone is totally tuned out because we totally screwed it up

1053
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,120
But that's all right

1054
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:33,120
All right. Well, thank you very much

1055
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:38,000
Thank you very much mumble room for being a part of the linux unplugged this week

1056
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:41,600
I really appreciate the opportunity to step in here for hair master chris

1057
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:47,200
Well, he's out getting some much-needed rest and then he can just kind of pop in here when he has great things to say

1058
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:52,080
The hair doesn't maintain itself folks. No, no, it sure doesn't. Thanks a lot west for being here. I really appreciate it

1059
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:55,300
It's wonderful to see you know it great. Well, we'll see you right back here next week

1060
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:57,300
So

1061
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:17,300
I've never installed gnu slash linux zombies don't run linux

1062
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:24,360
Is and the value of this is negative

1063
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:34,360
So

1064
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:50,280
So get it out of here

1065
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:03,320
You know one thing I uh one thing i'd really like I wish that soundboard thing had like a waveform so I could see

1066
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:09,560
When it's about to hit the thingy. Yeah, I have one that does that wouldn't you? Yeah good show. No a good show

1067
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:12,920
Thank you. Good show. Oh boy to get warm in here or what? Yeah

1068
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:15,320
I changed

1069
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:21,240
I literally changed mid show I changed so that all that stuff about patreon air conditioning would be amazing. Oh my god

1070
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:25,560
Thank you mumble room. You guys are great. Think about how much longer they can work

1071
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:27,960
But you can't run it during the show, right?

1072
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:33,320
Dot com well if we got a unit that's across the yard and then we ducted it over here what we would do is

1073
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:37,560
Then we would run it into the furnace and then the essentially the furnace would be the distributor of the cold air

1074
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:41,080
That's the plan. You tell the real central air. Yeah, i've been looking into this

1075
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:45,720
It also means our furnace here in the studio is 18 years old now, so we'd have to replace the furnace, too

1076
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:48,300
Just get the whole job done. Jimmy titles

1077
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:55,080
Now we all gotta go boat. Oh, did you have fun noah? Yeah. Thank you. Good good

1078
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:58,200
Uh, the talking gnome noah's arch the gnome talks back

1079
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:04,440
Arch will strike kelly down titles on android. Oh, that is a pretty that's a more solid implementation than I expected

1080
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:06,680
Me too. That's what honestly. Yeah

1081
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:10,440
There was some reason I was like wanting someone to run android or I was wanting to run android

1082
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:12,760
I would use it like it's totally if there was an android app

1083
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:17,160
I had to have yeah, or if I had a device like this that I wanted to have a sling tv on or something

1084
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:19,160
Like that, okay. This will fix your android

1085
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:21,320
You got angros on that usb

1086
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:25,000
I like how every time you get on mic these days you paint me as like this

1087
01:19:26,340 --> 01:19:31,560
Unmovable arch user who is so in entrenched into arch. All right. All right. All right, mr

1088
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:37,480
Hot shot like like I couldn't point the machine running a running a distribution under the arch. Are you really?

1089
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:40,520
I mean, this is kind of unfortunate because that's running mint right there

1090
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:45,320
You see that mint menu right there, yeah, yeah

1091
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:49,800
I I just I just I just if it's here's where my

1092
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:53,960
Point to the machine that's that's not running arch that you didn't install for a review

1093
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:59,080
Well, okay, that's true. But also it just comes down to this if it's a computer. I want to install software on

1094
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:01,560
Then I don't use ubuntu

1095
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:04,040
That's just that's the calculus if it's a machine if it's a computer

1096
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:06,360
I'm gonna install one piece of software on like mumble and skype

1097
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:10,920
So two pieces of software then it's no big deal to run a ubuntu can handle that just fine

1098
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:14,200
You know, it's really easy to install telegram from the play store on android

1099
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:16,360
Yeah, you know, maybe you should oh, whoa

1100
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:22,440
What if skype was better on that on remix os and it is on desktop linux?

1101
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:25,080
Then we could start using that for our calls

1102
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:27,480
Actually just something quickly on telegram

1103
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:34,200
I didn't I didn't realize this I just got an ubuntu phone the first time ever and the telegram client on ubuntu

1104
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:38,520
Like ubuntu touched is beats the crap out of the android. I've heard it's really good

1105
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:42,120
Stickers yet

1106
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:44,120
It's uh, I don't know

1107
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:48,600
I'm going to send you a message. Let's see

1108
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:50,920
Okay, because last time I checked

1109
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:53,640
um even support stickers, which is like

1110
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:59,320
You know what, you know what, oh my god, I don't know i'm not normally this guy

1111
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:02,600
But this guy on reddit was giving me so much crap for how I covered

1112
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:05,960
The own cloud story in the linux action show this sunday

1113
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:09,160
and then I just realized that both frank

1114
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:11,560
and

1115
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:17,640
Joss tweeted out our coverage specifically. I was referring people to it, which gives me the sense that we were probably close to the mic

1116
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:21,480
Yeah, I saw that nailed today. What's that?

1117
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:24,360
They've got more news today

1118
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:25,960
the uh foundation

1119
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:27,960
Yeah from own cloud inc

1120
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:32,120
Like if you if you have a look at it like

1121
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:37,960
If you look at that in the context of everything that yos and frank and everybody said about why they left

1122
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:39,480
like

1123
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:42,520
The pieces are starting to come together. It's like it's pretty clear to me

1124
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:45,400
This is why they left

1125
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:47,800
This foundation

1126
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:53,960
Yeah, because like they like think about frank's initial bit of like who owns the community blah blah blah

1127
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:56,040
then look at the foundation thing and

1128
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:59,480
There's only two community elected seats on that board

1129
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:05,880
There's four corporate seats where any company can effectively buy their eligibility for that board

1130
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:11,240
There's one own cloud appointee. So that's out of a seven person board. The community's only two people

1131
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:15,320
And that's the kind of thing that I could see getting

1132
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:19,400
When you put that in the context of frank stuff that that's all looking really interesting

1133
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:24,920
Dude, you're totally right. Like I was reading that all backwards. I thought the foundation was a reaction to

1134
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:27,400
You know some of this bad

1135
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:36,280
It's press that they were getting because of people leaving but I bet you're right. I bet it's the opposite. I

1136
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:41,160
Mean the weird the weird thing with me I read that announcement and I read their their current spec and it's like okay

1137
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:44,840
I mean, I know i'm biased i'm, you know chairman of open sues of heaven's sake but

1138
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:48,840
looked at their rules and foundation charter and it's like

1139
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:52,280
They took everything out of the open suzer board spec

1140
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:54,920
And like ripped out the community part

1141
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:58,040
Yeah, people say i'm creating fud in this in the subreddit. I don't

1142
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:03,560
I find that I find that subreddit. Sometimes I just can't I can't track their same thinking. I don't think it's spreading fud

1143
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:05,960
I think it's I think it's like I guess

1144
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:11,000
What is exactly the fud of it? What's fun about saying these these people?

1145
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,640
And not only did I not cover it when it first started happening because it just seemed like drama

1146
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:17,880
But I waited till like multiple people left and another organization reported in this case. It was pharaonic

1147
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:20,600
I think even like I I don't think necessarily you did anything wrong

1148
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:22,360
But even if you covered it in a poor way

1149
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:26,520
I think it was clear that your intentions were there like you you've you've discussed that quite clearly

1150
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:28,760
I don't even yeah, I I guess when I look at it

1151
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:31,720
I I guess it feels like it feels like we're walking the line of

1152
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:36,440
If you talk about this stuff that equates to spreading fud and that's the line that makes me uncomfortable

1153
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:40,280
Don't say the bad things just don't ever talk about the bad things

1154
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:47,000
I think the bit the subreddit is trying to get onto and and I I agree with this part if this is a subreddit's point

1155
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:53,080
of there's a distinction between own cloud inc and the own cloud community and I think

1156
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:58,920
Yeah, what frank is trying to allude to actually part of the problem is that people don't see that distinction. So

1157
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:05,000
Your coverage is kind of evidence of that because you didn't really make a distinction between the two so you kind of equated

1158
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Well, no, I did specifically say

1159
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:12,360
Well, no, okay. So when we started the coverage, I did specifically say that there are two different entities

1160
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:17,240
But I think I I think it's because I am of the opinion that if frank and joss and others leave

1161
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:20,840
It's it is a bad sign. It's not necessarily they're doomed, but I am

1162
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:23,960
Honestly of the opinion that it is a bad development for them

1163
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
I don't think that's necessarily

1164
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:30,760
Bad analysis either. I think that is a concerning development

1165
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:37,400
I have no idea what they're planning besides. I have a pretty good suspicion. They're going to announce something tomorrow and

1166
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:42,520
obviously frank is a keynote speaker at open suzer conference later this month, but um

1167
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:44,920
the you know

1168
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:50,440
This could be like the libra office of the open office for own cloud. Hmm. Interesting

1169
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:55,000
Yeah, I I don't know if that's true this is purely speculation

1170
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,680
My end but you know, you know everybody said the same with libra office

1171
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:04,440
What are these crazy guys doing getting all idealistic and you know skipping away from that and it kind of worked out all right for them

1172
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:06,440
Well, you know i've had a lot of conversations with frank

1173
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:11,560
um, and he seems like a pretty intelligent individual and he seems like he's a pretty he's

1174
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:17,240
He very much is a big picture kind of person and uh, I I I think

1175
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:20,520
For that kind of project. He's a good person to be involved

1176
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:26,040
And so I just think it's a little unfortunate and hopefully if it does kind of go like the way of libra office open office

1177
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:29,240
Um, hopefully it'll sort of work out the same way. It has long-term, too

1178
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:35,080
For them, I don't know. This is linux unplugged episode 147

1179
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:38,920
For may 31st 2016

1180
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:42,520
Like what month is it what month is it?

1181
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:48,040
This is bsd unplugged, okay, here we go. All right, let's try again

1182
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:53,180
This is linux unplugged episode 147 for may 31st 2016

1183
01:25:53,180 --> 01:25:59,180
So

1184
01:26:12,380 --> 01:26:17,500
Welcome to linux unplugged your weekly linux talk show where we have kicked your host out of his seat and made him

1185
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:20,060
The soundboard operator. My name is noah

1186
01:26:20,060 --> 01:26:22,060
My name is west

1187
01:26:30,380 --> 01:26:35,580
This is what happens when we this is why we don't have nice things this is why we don't have nice things technology

1188
01:26:35,820 --> 01:26:42,380
All right, the one the one thing this thing's supposed to do the one thing the one job this computer literally has

1189
01:26:42,380 --> 01:26:50,460
Okay, no, it was micro usb. Probably wouldn't have that problem. There we go. One more time. No
