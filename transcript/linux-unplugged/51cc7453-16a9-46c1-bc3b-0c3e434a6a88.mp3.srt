1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,740
All right. Well, you remember that old 3D pinball game on Windows?

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,500
I mean, just about one of the only good things on Windows.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:14,060
Yeah. Well, someone managed to decompile it, get it running on Linux and put it on GitHub.

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,980
Oh, yeah. Yeah. You know, I should see if I can get a build of that.

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,660
I'm going to try real quick. See if we can get that.

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,420
I mean, we're not doing anything else right now.

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:28,980
You might as well. Actually, it was updated recently to a resizable window, scalable graphics.

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,780
Fancy. Yeah. Actually, pretty easy.

9
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,940
All right, Wes. Brace yourself. Let's see if we can launch it.

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,140
Let's find out. We'll find out live together.

11
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,660
Oh, this is great. OK, let's give it a shot.

12
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:45,260
Let's see if it works.

13
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,500
This is amazing. Look at that.

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:58,580
Uh oh, mumble room. You might just have to do the show without us today.

15
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,460
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

16
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,340
My name is Chris. My name is Wes.

17
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,380
And my name is Brent. Hello, gentlemen.

18
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,820
Pinball aside, the show must go on.

19
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,260
And this episode is brought to you by a cloud guru, the leader in learning for the cloud,

20
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,700
Linux and other modern tech skills, hundreds of courses and thousands of hands on labs.

21
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,700
Get certified, get hired, get learning at a cloud guru dot com.

22
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,380
Coming up on the show today.

23
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:34,340
Well, I just got done trying out the Pop OS 2110 beta on my Raspberry Pi 400.

24
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,100
And Jeremy from System 76 is going to stop by in a moment to chat with us about it.

25
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,060
Plus, we'll also have our thoughts on the perfect Linux laptop right now.

26
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,860
A little bit of community news in the show, as always, some pics and more.

27
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,900
So just get right to it before we do anything else.

28
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,100
Before I even attempt to introduce Jeremy, let's say time appropriate greetings to our virtual luck.

29
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,180
Hello, mumble room.

30
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,180
Hello, Brent.

31
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,180
Namaskaram.

32
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,980
Hello. Hello. Nice to see some solid numbers in there today.

33
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,820
And they all wear matching outfits. Wow.

34
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,660
I don't know how they coordinate that, but it is impressive.

35
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,340
You know, that matrix channel is useful for all kinds of things.

36
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,340
That's pretty great.

37
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:15,300
Well, so this last week, Pop OS 2110 entered the beta phase.

38
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,100
And, you know, we've been keeping an eye on things because it had been teased that there might be a Raspberry Pi version.

39
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:26,420
And sure enough, it appears an image for the Raspberry Pi for Pop OS 2110 has been published.

40
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:34,300
As soon as we saw that, well, we just had to reach out to Jeremy Saller, principal engineer at System 76 and Pop OS maintainer.

41
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,020
And he joins us now. Jeremy, welcome back to the show.

42
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,500
Thanks for having me. I love being here.

43
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,060
Thank you for being here. And I know behind the scenes you told us you're a little under the weather

44
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,580
and you still made it. So we really appreciate it.

45
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:52,780
And I had to reach out to you last minute, too, because as a Pi fan, I was pretty happy to see this.

46
00:02:52,900 --> 00:03:01,220
I think the Raspberry Pi with external SSD storage as the primary disk is starting to get to a pretty usable desktop state.

47
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:10,060
Like it's in the zone now. But I tried this out with an SD card, Jeremy, and it's definitely usable, but it's slower for sure.

48
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:19,020
And I'm wondering, as you've been tinkering with this, do you see storage the way storage works right now in the Pi as one of the limiting factors for like a butter smooth desktop Linux experience?

49
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,860
Yeah, so I've been I'm the primary person behind this.

50
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:29,460
I've been working on it in kind of pieces of chunks of time that I can cut out of my normal Pop OS duties.

51
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:37,580
And I do everything on an SD card because I want to see how bad it is for the average person.

52
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:49,580
I'm still using the Pi 400. So the the recommended configuration is the Pi 400, because it has a slight CPU overclock with four gigabytes of RAM or more and using an SD card.

53
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:55,100
And yeah, definitely the weakest part of the whole solution is the storage speed.

54
00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:04,420
If you start using a I have an external 10 gigabit per second USB 3.2 Gen 2 NVMe adapter.

55
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:11,620
That's a lot of jargon, but it's fast. It's probably 100 times faster than an SD card.

56
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:27,420
So when I'm using that, it definitely, definitely improves the experience to the point where I feel it is similar to a laptop from about five years ago, a kind of lower end laptop from about five years ago.

57
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,300
Which is fairly impressive when you consider the entry price of the Raspberry Pi, right?

58
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,780
Absolutely. For 100 bucks, you can't really do much better.

59
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,180
So I mean, I have to ask this question, right?

60
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:44,340
This is the obvious question, but aren't you just making it easier for people to not buy system 76 machines by doing this?

61
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,940
Absolutely not. And, you know, I thought the same thing, like, is this going to cannibalize our market?

62
00:04:49,940 --> 00:05:01,380
And I feel that when people have a low cost entry point, when they do finally have the budget for a more powerful computer, where are they going to go?

63
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:06,140
They're going to come back to the manufacturers of the operating system that they love.

64
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,180
And I know this happens.

65
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:17,300
So I think we've only amplified the thirst for our products among our customer base because they already had Raspberry Pis.

66
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:26,260
They already had our products. It was a very, you know, closed Venn diagram of the two, making them happy, only amps up our products even more.

67
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,340
Yeah, not to be cliche about it, but it is it's a it's a halo effect.

68
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:35,860
Right. OK, so I was curious because I'm not I'm not a developer and you're pretty deep into this stuff.

69
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:44,260
Do you find that it makes the X86 version of Pop OS better by doing these kinds of ports and working to get it up on the Raspberry Pi?

70
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:55,100
It definitely does. Part of the porting process was to do a complete 2110 has a lot of changes, and we haven't really explained those well yet.

71
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:01,820
And there's a lot of low level changes that have happened that you're going to see later on when we explain it.

72
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:07,260
So we are going to be switching to the stable kernel releases.

73
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:20,060
We're working on releasing the 5.14.13 kernel currently on 2110 that will hopefully have us on the mainline kernel indefinitely.

74
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:31,660
So rather than utilizing the Ubuntu kernel and then applying patches to it, the intention of that is to have a closer link with the upstream kernel development.

75
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:50,860
The major blocker to that is the NVIDIA driver. That's one of the changes. Another change is we're moving off Launchpad and we are moving our repositories to our own server apt.pop-os.org because Launchpad had all the build infrastructure for ARM64 already, we didn't have that.

76
00:06:50,860 --> 00:07:10,860
So we actually took a System76 Starling server, which we did not, honestly, we did not sell very many of, but it was one of our previous ARM offerings, and set it up as a build server so we could do ARM64 builds, and we re-architected the packaging of Pop!

77
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:40,780
We re-architected the packaging of Pop! OS to allow for Pop! Server, a server edition of Pop! OS. So all of this stuff happening basically because of the Raspberry Pi port, and we also redid our build system to write it in Rust and to ensure that it was able to spit out builds for X86, for ARM64, and hopefully in the future for RISC-V6.

78
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:58,860
So that all adds up to a lot of low-level changes to ensure that we are in place for what I see the architectures of the future being, which are ARCH64, RISC-V64, GC.

79
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:11,860
That's quite a bit of knock-on effect. I didn't expect all of that. I'd like to jump back just to the Launchpad transition. So this is everything, right? This is the build tools, this is the bug tracking, and this is also the package hosting.

80
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:34,860
All of that was moved off for 2110, so now it's all in-house Pop! OS stuff. That means we still do use the Ubuntu mirrors for Ubuntu packages, but all of the Pop! OS packages, which is about 100 packages, are coming from our own app.pop-os.org server.

81
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:51,860
So if I understand you, essentially the next release will be based on 22.04, which will be an LTS Ubuntu land, but you're going to maybe be using a different kernel from upstream, a mainline kernel with an LTS Ubuntu land on top of it?

82
00:08:51,860 --> 00:09:04,860
Yeah, we hope to continue. We're actually hoping to release that 5.14 kernel even on 20.04 LTS, so we'll be backporting it to our prior LTS release as well.

83
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:29,860
The intention is that Pop! OS will be the distribution that will run on any hardware possible with absolutely no compromises, and the biggest compromise with the Ubuntu kernel development cycle is the SRU process and the fact that new hardware can take at least two weeks, but usually a month, to get support.

84
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:39,860
And the biggest problem with the Fedora process, which does something similar to what we're trying to do, is they don't really care about the NVIDIA driver.

85
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:48,860
And I understand from their position why that would be the case. Anybody shipping the 5.14 kernel right now does not care about the NVIDIA driver.

86
00:09:48,860 --> 00:10:00,860
That includes Arch, that includes Fedora. The reason is that the NVIDIA driver has no stable configuration, no bugless configuration that works on the 5.14 kernel.

87
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:20,860
The last NVIDIA driver that was released, the 470.74 driver, had issues with G-Sync. It was the first driver to support 5.14, so you're either breaking G-Sync configurations or you are releasing the 5.14 kernel. You can't do both.

88
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:41,860
So our intention with switching to the mainline kernel is to ensure that these regressions don't happen as often, that we have as close to mainline as possible Linux kernel that also supports all of the available hardware in the entire desktop ecosystem.

89
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:53,860
I mean, that obviously would make Pop OS compelling to both gamers, but like you said, people that want other architectures. But the big but that I see is it seems like it really puts a lot more of the burden of testing on you guys.

90
00:10:53,860 --> 00:11:02,860
So are you thinking like you'll have some people in-house running the kernels for a bit, testing them, dogfooding them? Or what are your thoughts on how to accomplish the testing aspect?

91
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:25,860
I think it's very important for us to increase the size of our team, and we're doing that now. So we just put out a job posting for Pop OS developers. The only requirements are that you know Rust and that you have a good internet connection.

92
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:35,860
We wanted to limit the requirements so we would get as many applicants as possible, and we're going to be hiring multiple people from that role. It's not just one person being hired from that role.

93
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:44,860
So we're going to build out the engineering team, and I believe Neil has something to talk about. I might have misspoken on Fedora, so I'd love to hear that.

94
00:11:44,860 --> 00:12:03,860
Yeah, so we absolutely do care about the NVIDIA driver with the latest kernel stuff. Part of the complexity here is really getting NVIDIA to care. From a community perspective, we try to engage and make sure that things are patched, and we try to do the best we can in terms of testing.

95
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:19,860
The major complexity issue we have right now is that, for example, you brought up G-Sync. I don't know anybody on the team that actually checks this stuff that actually has a G-Sync monitor and knows how to correctly test for G-Sync.

96
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:28,860
It's not a question of whether or not Fedora wants to care about it or not. It's a question of, we just don't know how to. We don't know how to test and make sure that that works.

97
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:49,860
I completely understand the amount of hardware out there to test, and the reality is NVIDIA doesn't really care that much, so they're happy to leave. When 5.14 came along, it took them three months to make an NVIDIA driver that actually worked on 5.14, and then it had the G-Sync regression.

98
00:12:49,860 --> 00:13:12,860
The big problem is NVIDIA, but I feel that if there is somebody like System76 that does have the ability to test, and we do the same thing, we try to do the same thing Fedora is doing, we get to mainline kernels, then maybe it won't be such a problem for Arch and Fedora anymore if we're all targeting mainline kernels.

99
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:28,860
We can start saying, hey, as a team, as a desktop distribution team, Fedora, Arch, PopOS, and all the others, this new kernel has regressions with the NVIDIA driver.

100
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:44,860
We know that a significant portion of the desktop Linux market is using NVIDIA cards, even if the upstream Linux developers are willing to break the NVIDIA driver, we still do have to have something that works for the people who have NVIDIA GPUs.

101
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,860
Absolutely.

102
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:59,860
That's always been one of the best and most important roles that I think distro maintainers can take, and I know you guys also have customers that you want to keep happy, which is one of the reasons why I think it actually ends up working out for all end users.

103
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,860
Wow, there's a lot to unpack there, Jeremy.

104
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:07,860
It seems like there's a lot of things in motion, including things like a pop server and other things that may be down the pipe.

105
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:20,860
I'm wondering if you have any other kind of anecdotes to share with the Raspberry Pi, like expectations you might want to set or anything like that, because we're going to link to it in the show notes, and I have a feeling some people will check it out after the show.

106
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:32,860
Well, I'm pretty happy with it, just based on trying out Raspberry Pi OS and Ubuntu on the Pi, both Ubuntu server and Ubuntu desktop on the Pi.

107
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,860
I think it stacks up well compared to those.

108
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:47,860
You definitely need the four gigabytes RAM or more, and I would definitely prefer if people were trying USB 3.0 or faster storage.

109
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:52,860
Other than that, it's pretty much stock pop desktop.

110
00:14:52,860 --> 00:15:01,860
We haven't really made many changes at all to adapt it for the Raspberry Pi, other than making sure all the packages we're building for ARM64.

111
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,860
Right.

112
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,860
Very good.

113
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,860
Well, I enjoy it.

114
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:17,860
I think it makes for my ideal little use for the Pi 400 right now is kind of like an emergency go to machine that has my email accounts, my calendar, my web browser logged into my profile.

115
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:26,860
Even if I forget my laptop or my desktop is crashed for some reason, it's like it's my go bag of computers that is standing by.

116
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,860
And I think the pop desktop is kind of perfect on there.

117
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,860
So I just think the way it all works with the launcher and all of that has been ideal.

118
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,860
Jeremy, thanks for coming on the show and explaining all this to us.

119
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,860
Yeah, thanks for having me.

120
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:47,860
If you were wondering how you would know which games might work best on the deck versus those that might not.

121
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,860
Well, it seems Valve has a solution.

122
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,860
This week, they announced the Steam Deck Verified program.

123
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,860
This seems like a pretty good idea, right?

124
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:04,860
Because how were we as consumers, especially if you're not maybe as savvy as a news follower, like how would you really know what games work best on the deck or not?

125
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,860
And it seems like this is probably going to solve that.

126
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:15,860
Right. And it strikes me that we have inspired with the deck, it seems, a lot of Windows users to try Linux.

127
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:20,860
We've had some listeners that have been Windows users for a long time who are currently trying out the deck.

128
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:25,860
You see the Linus Tech Tips folks taking out a Linux challenge right now.

129
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,860
That's probably the most prominent one. That's probably the one I should have.

130
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,860
Of course.

131
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:35,860
But like the Linus Tech Tips challenge, a lot of people are missing the forest through the trees.

132
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:42,860
And this is something I've observed in the notes that we've received and something I've observed watching the Linus Tech Tips Linux switch challenge.

133
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:49,860
What Valve has done here with the deck is they've created a carefully crafted set of hardware and software to make sure that the end user gets a great experience.

134
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,860
And they've built for Linux.

135
00:16:53,860 --> 00:17:06,860
But a lot of these switch challengers, and I don't mean anything disparaging if you're a listener, you've got to understand you're cobbling together hardware that you've had forever that you bought specifically for Windows.

136
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:18,860
And you're getting frustrated when it doesn't work, which is a bit akin to like being a Windows user forever and then going out and getting one of these new Macs and then being frustrated that the hardware you bought to work with your Windows box doesn't work with your Mac.

137
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,860
Like, that'd be silly. Everybody would just take that as obvious on its face.

138
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:27,860
Well, yeah, you bought something that only works with Windows. Of course, it doesn't work with your fancy new M1X Mac or whatever.

139
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:32,860
So it's sort of like that same philosophy isn't being applied to the Linux switch.

140
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,860
Like Linux is just expected to work with everything, I guess.

141
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,860
And I mean, that would be awesome, but it's just not happening.

142
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:48,860
For most things, it does, right? For an incredible array of hardware. But unfortunately, hardware and drivers matter, and sometimes it just doesn't work.

143
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:55,860
Yeah. And I mean, I'd love it to, but it's like you're missing the point here.

144
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,860
I don't know. I see people struggling with this, and I think this is a great idea.

145
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,860
So the DECK really does teach us to get this working.

146
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:07,860
You need a curated set of hardware. You need a set of drivers you know that work.

147
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:16,860
And then putting a certified for the DECK program on top of this, it also kind of gives developers like a goalpost now, right?

148
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:21,860
Developers kind of have an idea of, well, what do we need to do to be DECK compatible?

149
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,860
Is it just Proton? Is there something more to it?

150
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:27,860
Like there's actually something to accomplish now for game developers.

151
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:34,860
And for consumers, I would assume there'll hopefully be a list that gets compiled either by Valve or someone.

152
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:39,860
And consumers can check that list before they buy a DECK, I would think.

153
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:45,860
Yeah. Hopefully this, you know, assuades any fears right now and makes both sides of the marketplace a little more interested in investing.

154
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,860
I'm curious, Brent, if you're in the market for a new machine.

155
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,860
One of our emails later in the show is about an ideal Linux laptop.

156
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:58,860
And Apple just announced these M1 Pro and M1 Macs based.

157
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,860
Macs? A Macs Mac. Are you curious? Are you tempted to get a Macs Mac, Brent?

158
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:07,860
I saw all the notes in our show notes ahead of time because I have that insight.

159
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,860
I got really excited. My antennae are tingling.

160
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:17,860
So I will say Alex and I built this sort of Franken X250 of mine here in front of me.

161
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,860
But it's just right. It's just disappointing.

162
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:30,860
So I'm really looking forward to getting something else and to, you know, with all of the offerings we've seen come out in the last few months.

163
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,860
I'm actually happy to say it's going to be a hard choice.

164
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:45,860
Yeah, I was kind of kidding about buying a MacBook, but we may be nearing a future where you could actually buy a current MacBook from Apple and get it home and put Linux on it.

165
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:52,860
We don't know yet, but it seems Asahi Linux feels like they have a good shot.

166
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,860
They feel like they've got a chance of getting this working.

167
00:19:54,860 --> 00:20:05,860
You know, that actually feels a little bit unbelievable to me because it feels like only a month or two ago we were talking about, you know, the very beginnings of having that work be done.

168
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:10,860
And how are we where we are now? It seems fabulous is the only word.

169
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,860
I know. We don't know for sure if these new machines will work.

170
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:24,860
No, we do not. Although it sounds like Hector Martin has ordered a new MacBook with one of these shiny new SOCs in it and is going to do a live bring up stream sometime soon.

171
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:34,860
So, yeah, fingers crossed, right? I mean, this is going to be a test of some of their design, some of their projections that, you know, the unique setup of this Apple Silicon might make this process going forward easier.

172
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,860
And now we kind of just have to hope.

173
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:46,860
Yeah, there are some unique ways that Apple set it up in such that a lot of what runs the internals of the M1 SOC is done in hardware.

174
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:51,860
And so the OS doesn't have to be directly in control, but it has to have interfaces to that.

175
00:20:51,860 --> 00:21:07,860
And they think because some of those interfaces haven't changed since very, very early in Apple's SOC days, they think there's a good chance that Apple won't change them for the next iteration just to keep things simpler for Mac OS development.

176
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:20,860
And knock on effect to that is it means a lot of the work they've done to bring Linux up on the M1, which is not all upstream, but a very significant amount of it is now upstream and the rest is pending upstream.

177
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:27,860
They think a lot of that work that they've done may just automatically apply to the new chips that Apple just announced.

178
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:31,860
And like Wes said, Hector is so confident that he's going to live stream it.

179
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:36,860
I think it's like next week or sometime you have to check his Twitter feed, but that'll be interesting.

180
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:40,860
He's just going to do it live and he's going to troubleshoot and work his way through it.

181
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:52,860
And the reason why we mentioned this is I think we have to acknowledge that from a technological standpoint, these are pretty impressive chips. What Apple is accomplishing here with performance to power ratio is really good to see, actually.

182
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,860
And I hope it drives the rest of the industry.

183
00:21:54,860 --> 00:22:07,860
And getting Linux onto that, I think, is going to be pretty significant because not only does it open up new hardware to more people and that on its face, more choice I think is always a good thing.

184
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:11,860
And if you don't think choice is a good thing, you're probably not very happy as a Linux user.

185
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:19,860
And then secondarily, I think just from a repairability and a lifespan and also a data forensic and security standpoint.

186
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:28,860
Just nerdery, too, right? I mean, like you put Linux on here and look at how much already we've learned more than we would have learned from Apple directly by Hector and the team's efforts, right?

187
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,860
Like we know so much more about the internals.

188
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,860
It's not that it doesn't feel weird, right, Brent?

189
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:38,860
But it's compelling hardware and it does, especially for a photographer, it does sort of address a specific market use.

190
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:46,860
Yeah, and I remember a time not even so long ago when we were all quite disappointed in Apple's hardware and then they just kind of leapfrogged everybody into this stuff.

191
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,860
It's really impressive to see and exciting.

192
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,860
I haven't been excited about Mac stuff for a long time.

193
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,860
I agree.

194
00:22:52,860 --> 00:23:03,860
In fact, on Koda Radio, I was quite critical of their Mac hardware over the last few years, especially the early butterfly keyboard systems that only had 16 gigs of RAM.

195
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:11,860
And now that we're seeing systems that can support 10 cores and 64 gigs of RAM, now you're starting to speak my language.

196
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,860
I start to take notice, too, when you're talking about doing all of that around 35 watts.

197
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,860
I find that unbelievable.

198
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,860
So I very much like to see my favorite operating system on there.

199
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:24,860
And I think the Asahi Linux team has probably got a pretty good shot.

200
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:28,860
I think if you were in Vegas and you were betting, I think the odds are on them.

201
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:36,860
But there's something else going on this year along with all of this stuff about new architectures and ARM in the background.

202
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:42,860
And let's be honest, in the space that actually makes money for Linux, the server market's in a bit of an upheaval.

203
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:48,860
And we've all kind of learned the lesson of how important a community enterprise Linux distribution is.

204
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:53,860
So we're keeping an eye on what's going on in that space as the December deadline for traditional CentOS approaches.

205
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:58,860
And this week, it looks like the AMA Linux folks have done the undoable.

206
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:02,860
Nobody would take this challenge on well and stick with it, I should say.

207
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:06,860
Jack, it sounds like AMA Linux is introducing a new migration tool.

208
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:14,860
And if I follow, it means I could migrate, say, from older versions of rail, potentially even like version seven to AMA Linux or what?

209
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,860
Tell me how this works.

210
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:24,860
Yeah, hey, so from versions of CentOS to really any enterprise Linux derivative distribution.

211
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:30,860
So that's AMA Linux, Oracle, even CentOS itself, and also Rocky Linux.

212
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,860
That's amazing.

213
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:38,860
You're telling me that I could just use this to get my butt off of rail seven on to just sent off stream.

214
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:45,860
Yes, if you wanted to, we're not billing it as a conversion away from rail.

215
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,860
Right. Right. Of course.

216
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,860
Why would you that be suicidal?

217
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,860
Well, I mean, it's not that's not what we're after.

218
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,860
And I think that's not the audience for it.

219
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:57,860
But I think it's more anyone that's still running like CentOS seven.

220
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:05,860
And we hope that eventually we'll be able to support CentOS six and maybe even an earlier version to just, you know,

221
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:10,860
come up to a newer version and, you know, bring their stuff into modernity.

222
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:19,860
Oh, my gosh. I can't I don't think I can express to you the level of gratitude I would have felt back in the day when I was administering rail systems.

223
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:26,860
And this was before they adopted Yammer, obviously DNF and moving older rail systems to newer rail systems.

224
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:34,860
Or what I used to end up having to do the hard way was hard migrate as an existing rail box to CentOS.

225
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,860
And it was almost always a couple of versions of rail behind.

226
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:42,860
So, I mean, it was to say it was an all nighter is an understatement.

227
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,860
So a tool like this.

228
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,860
Well, I just I'd be buying you guys all the beers right now.

229
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:53,860
So congratulations, because not a lot of people want to take this on because it seems like something that is fraught with landmines.

230
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,860
Listen, you still need to be careful.

231
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:04,860
You still need to make sure that, you know, you're following like sysadmin best practices and make backups.

232
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:08,860
And, you know, you may want to do like a dry run in the sandbox or something.

233
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:13,860
But, yeah, I mean, it's it's definitely doable if you're smart about it.

234
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:20,860
And I think that as time goes on, you know, listen, we're doing this as a community wide project.

235
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:29,860
So I think that as more people get involved, as more people test it and as more people contribute back, it will only get better and only get easier over time.

236
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:38,860
That's nice. And, yeah, I have no doubt that anyone in our audience, especially anyone who's been using CentOS or rail that's getting pretty old, they're going to do a dry run.

237
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,860
I have faith in them. Well, thanks for coming out and explaining this.

238
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:44,860
I know it's a busy day over there for you, Jack. So it's good to get the scoop directly.

239
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:48,860
So that way I didn't miss up the details. And it's a great tool to see. So thanks for joining us.

240
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:54,860
Yeah, absolutely. And if anyone wants more info, check out on the Linux dot org slash elevate.

241
00:26:54,860 --> 00:27:02,860
And, you know, where we look forward to working with everyone across the EL derivative community.

242
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:10,860
So hopefully this is something that, you know, us, Oracle, Rocky, even Santos and Rell themselves can all contribute to.

243
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:16,860
And we definitely look forward to that. I think that's something that's, you know, a little bit missing in the community today.

244
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:22,860
So hopefully this is something we can all come together on Lino dot com slash unplug.

245
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,860
Go there to get one hundred dollars and sixty day credit on a new account.

246
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,860
And you go there to support the show listener support.

247
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:33,860
And this is one of the ways you can support the show is what lets us stay independent and stay true to our listeners.

248
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:39,860
It's by your support. And you can do that by going to Lino dot com slash unplug and you get one hundred dollars and sixty day credit.

249
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:45,860
Lino is my favorite way to host something. I've been using them for over a couple of years now and I absolutely wholeheartedly recommend them.

250
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:51,860
Even if they weren't a sponsor, I'd still tell you this is the place to go. Don't tell Lino that though.

251
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,860
You know, it makes sense, really. They're independent. That always checks a box with me.

252
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,860
They've been around forever, 18 years, which is forever in Internet time.

253
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:03,860
And they have remained focused on their mission to make computing simple, affordable and accessible to all in the cloud.

254
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:08,860
And that's led to a best in class experience. Nobody checks all of the boxes. Lino checks.

255
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:12,860
Oh, yeah, there's lots of ways to host stuff.

256
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:18,860
And some companies check some of the boxes and some of those boxes are pretty important boxes, but nobody checks all of them.

257
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,860
And when you get one hundred dollars in credit, you can go see what I'm talking about.

258
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:27,860
Lino dot com slash unplug. For example, go deploy a next cloud server, maybe a Minecraft server.

259
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:31,860
Go build up a development environment or do what I do all the time and A.B.

260
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,860
test stuff, different distros or different projects.

261
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:41,860
I've mentioned this before to you, but one of my favorite activities on Linode is trying out several different permutations of a project and picking the one I like the most.

262
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:48,860
I did this a bit ago when we were looking at infrastructure options and I wanted to try out various different WordPress configurations.

263
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:55,860
But to get WordPress really fast, like, you know, rank really well in the Google search kind of fast, you got to kind of have to tweak it a little bit.

264
00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:02,860
And Linode has a one click that I ended up going with that was better than anything else I built myself, which is all based on top of the light speed stack.

265
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:06,860
You'd be really impressed by how fast you can actually get WordPress going on Linode.

266
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:15,860
And it doesn't take like a crazy expensive box either. In fact, their prices are 30 to 50 percent cheaper than the major hypervisors out there that want to lock you into their system anyways.

267
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:21,860
And they have an easy to use cloud dashboard that's so much more straightforward than anything else those guys have cooked up.

268
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:26,860
I don't know what they're doing over there. It must be designed by like a committee of 100 over there.

269
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:33,860
And then Linode layers on top. Great services you're going to eventually find are just invaluable, like S3 compatible object storage at fantastic prices.

270
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:41,860
DDoS protection, VLAN support, a powerful DNS manager and so much more that, you know, us nerds really appreciate.

271
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,860
But don't worry if you're brand new, you've never even spun up a server.

272
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:48,860
They've got stuff that'll work for you, too, like those one click deployments and a really nice interface.

273
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:55,860
And the best part, and even as pros use this sometime, the best customer support in the business.

274
00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:01,860
Man, I can't tell you how nice it is when your production stuff is having an issue to have somebody you can call that's willing to help.

275
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:06,860
Linode is great and it could be part of your multi cloud strategy or it can be your cloud like it is for us.

276
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:10,860
And they've been supporting open source initiatives that we love from the very beginning.

277
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:19,860
Like Kubuntu or the all things open conference, which Linode is at this week, or my beloved Linux Fest Northwest, which I hope will return to in person soon.

278
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,860
Either way, Linode is dedicated to offering the best in virtualized cloud computing.

279
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,860
If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode.

280
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:35,860
So go to linode.com slash unplugged, get that one hundred dollars and support the show. Linode dot com slash unplugged.

281
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:41,860
We do have some housekeeping, some things to take care of around here, and I want to say right up front, thank you, members.

282
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:45,860
We had a couple of people sign up last week, long timers, and it's awesome to see that.

283
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:49,860
If you've been thinking about supporting unplugged core dot com, go there, join us.

284
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:57,860
You get two feed options, a limited ad feed, nice and tight, same fold, Joe touch, just a shorter run time.

285
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:05,860
Or the big sucker, the live show, which as of right now is already an hour long.

286
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:09,860
So it's a lot more show and it's going to keep on going, too.

287
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,860
So you get that. There's tons of good content in there.

288
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:16,860
In fact, the businessmen in me says I should be monetizing that content or at least cutting it up and sharing it more often.

289
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:20,860
I may every now and then share a special one, but part of it is the loose atmosphere.

290
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,860
It's the version we just shouldn't be releasing.

291
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:26,860
Yeah. It's like the stuff you say because you're not releasing it. Right.

292
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,860
And then you release it.

293
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,860
Well, to our members, because we know that they get us right.

294
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,860
Like they get us. They're supporting us. So cool.

295
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,860
Yeah. So like a lot of trust in this member.

296
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,860
That's what it is. It's like we trust that they get us and that we can say stuff in front of them.

297
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,860
And so that's that's sort of one of the benefits of being a member.

298
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:46,860
UnpluggedCore.com to sign up for that. We'd love your feedback. We want to integrate more of it.

299
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:49,860
In fact, it's something that I'm trying to stay on top of more and more.

300
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:53,860
So please do Linux Unplugged.com slash contact for that.

301
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,860
Our Matrix community is continuing to grow.

302
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,860
This I'm really getting excited more and more about Matrix.

303
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:02,860
You know, there's a lot of platforms that are great. I'm on Discord. I'm on Telegram.

304
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:08,860
But I feel like long term Matrix is solving a lot of problems and opening a lot of doors.

305
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,860
Why not get in on that Linux Unplugged.com slash Matrix.

306
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:15,860
Go there. Join. There's a there's a lot of group.

307
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,860
There's all kinds of there's new spaces that kernels worked on that are beautiful.

308
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:22,860
So you can if you're just a Linux Unplugged listener, you can just focus in on that.

309
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:26,860
It's great. So that's over at Linux Unplugged.com slash Matrix.

310
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:31,860
And then I mentioned that love plug that happens on Sundays at noon Pacific in our Mumble room.

311
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,860
Details at Linux Unplugged.com slash Mumble so you can sign up.

312
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:41,860
And then the nice thing is you get to hang out with like minded Linux users and then you got a Mumble client that's already good to go.

313
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:47,860
So like perhaps you like Jose who joined us in Denver and has made it to the Mumble room today.

314
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,860
Jose, tell everybody where you're from.

315
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:53,860
I'm from Puerto Rico. I'm a self-taught web developer.

316
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:57,860
I have a freelance shop and I want a Raspberry Pi in Denver.

317
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:01,860
That's right. You did win the Raspberry Pi. And what time is it where you're at right now?

318
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:06,860
Right now, it's almost three thirty in the afternoon. It's basically Puerto Rico.

319
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,860
It's basically Eastern time, but we don't have daylight savings.

320
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,860
So that's the same time the whole year.

321
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:16,860
Jose's making in the middle of his workday. I'm just saying be like Jose.

322
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:19,860
You know, just take a long lunch and come join us on a Tuesday sometime.

323
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:23,860
You're not feeling great. Maybe something went wrong. Come hang out with your Linux friends.

324
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:27,860
Go get our Mumble set up. Linux Unplugged.com slash Mumble. Be like Jose.

325
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:31,860
Be a long time listener. And then eventually one of these days you can just pop you get an afternoon.

326
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,860
You can pop in. It's great. And you hang out and chat with us directly.

327
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:40,860
And you also, kind of a nice benefit, get the lowest latency, highest quality audio live stream.

328
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,860
Straight from the source. With all of our extra mistakes.

329
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,860
Hey, well, how about some feedback, huh?

330
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,860
Yeah.

331
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,860
Eric writes in and says Garuda saved his butt.

332
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:59,860
I'm a big fan of Arch on my personal laptop, so I've been testing out some of your recommendations like Endeavor OS and Garuda.

333
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:05,860
Well, I'm at my first in-person conference this week in over two years.

334
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:09,860
And I updated my laptop before leaving.

335
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:14,860
Didn't think much of it till I got to my hotel and tried to use my laptop.

336
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,860
Uh oh.

337
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:22,860
While updating my system really meant I ran Pac-Man, S.Y.U. and didn't check any outputs.

338
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:23,860
Oh, man.

339
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:28,860
When I got to my hotel, it wouldn't boot because there were no kernels to be found.

340
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,860
Oh, no.

341
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:35,860
Luckily, I had my handy dandy vent toy USB stick and started trying to set up my true environment.

342
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:40,860
When I realized Garuda had been taking ButterFS snapshots.

343
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,860
Heck yeah.

344
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:51,860
I proceeded to reboot my laptop, selected a previous snapshot, logged in, restored it, rebooted again, and I was up and running as if nothing had happened.

345
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:55,860
Man, isn't that what we've been talking about right here on the show?

346
00:34:55,860 --> 00:35:01,860
Why? Why we needed to up our file system game a little bit just to make these things more reliable workstations.

347
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,860
And yeah, he's rolling the dice with an update right before he leaves.

348
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:08,860
It sounds like one of my moves, but it was pretty nice that he can roll back, huh?

349
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,860
Yeah, no kidding.

350
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:17,860
Now, there is one thing Eric did know that he was very grateful that there's just this tight integration between Pac-Man and TimeShip and grub and all of that set up for you in Garuda.

351
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,860
Yeah.

352
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:23,860
He did just have one complaint, though, and I thought maybe you could inform him here, Chris.

353
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:28,860
This is also the first distro that I'm sticking with that uses KDE as the desktop environment.

354
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:33,860
And boy, is it sluggish on my laptop with an Intel N5000.

355
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,860
Do you have any plasma performance tips I can try?

356
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,860
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

357
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:46,860
So the that's one of those silver edition Intel processors that has like a one gigahertz or one point one gigahertz frequency.

358
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,860
It's pretty rough. It bursts up to two point seven.

359
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:52,860
But depending on your cooling, like it won't necessarily hold that for very long.

360
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:56,860
It is low power, though. That is that is nice. That's rough.

361
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:03,860
You can go into the you may have seen this already, but you can go into the compositor settings and you can try different versions of OpenGL.

362
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:11,860
You can also there's a there's an option there to speed up the animations or slow down the animations.

363
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,860
And I would recommend you play with that.

364
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:21,860
And I'm trying to think, is anybody in the Mumble Room have any plasma performance tips and any tips or ideas for making plasma run just a little bit quicker?

365
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:26,860
You know, I have turned off you know, you mentioned animations and stuff.

366
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,860
I go through and turn all that stuff off.

367
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:33,860
Like Wimpy was saying last week, sometimes it's nice to just have it be a little bit snappier.

368
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:39,860
I think maybe my laptop's a bit more performant, but I still it just makes a big difference, I find, on Katie.

369
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:46,860
And so I'd give that a shot. Go through all the settings and turn them low or off is even better if you can and if you don't care about that stuff.

370
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,860
Yeah. And you would know you're struggling with low end hardware at the moment.

371
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:53,860
I know. I know. I'm making it though. It's going OK.

372
00:36:53,860 --> 00:37:00,860
Counterintuitively, I would make sure that you are not falling back to CPU rendering compositing.

373
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:08,860
Yeah. If you're rendering on OpenGL, you'll actually get better performance than you would if you're on, say, X render or no compositing at all.

374
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:17,860
Because when you have no compositing or you're using X to do compositing, you will force the CPU to do all of the work instead of offloading it to the GPU.

375
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:24,860
And I'll take it one step further, Neil, depending on how good your GPU is. And in the end, 5000, this might not apply.

376
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:36,860
But if you have a more modern Intel GPU or any of the larger commercial GPUs, having some animation actually kind of papers over the loading time of the window in a way.

377
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:42,860
Because if you just turn off all animations, you will get the absolute fastest. The machine can draw that on the screen. Absolutely.

378
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:53,860
But that's not always a satisfying speed, to tell you the truth. And with the animation effect, like a little fade in or whatever it is, kind of papers over your perception of that a little bit.

379
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:58,860
Because the window is actually still rendering and drawing as it's fading in. And that just makes it a smoother process.

380
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,860
You don't always get a performance improvement.

381
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:09,860
And I actually find I become more sensitive of how my system's performing when I turn off all the animations because I can clearly see it struggling.

382
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:16,860
But it really depends on your combination of CPU and GPU. And it's just something you have to go through and kind of mess around with.

383
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:20,860
But if you have any tips, Linux Unplugged dot com slash contact, maybe we can compile them together.

384
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:30,860
Brian wrote in with a neat new tip about functionality in the kernel. He says you mentioned he's talking to me that you were trying out a battery charge threshold on your laptop using TLP.

385
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:35,860
And then I would forget to use TLP full charge almost all the time.

386
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:41,860
This bit me on the road trip and I'd go to use my laptop and it would have at best like a 65 percent charge. Right.

387
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:46,860
It's no good. But Brian points out that this functionality was recently exposed by the kernel.

388
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:54,860
So you don't actually need TLP to do this anymore. And then you can trigger the charge or charge threshold with system D.

389
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:57,860
And you can start as you could. He includes a unit file as an example.

390
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:06,860
You can start and stop a service that sets the thresholds or sets it to full charge. And he says I even automate it with a hotkey.

391
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:14,860
That's a pretty neat idea. And I didn't realize that battery charge threshold settings have been exposed by the kernel and that system D knew what to do with that.

392
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:21,860
That's awesome. Looks like it's nothing too crazy in the system to set up just using bash to echo some values under slash this.

393
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,860
But hey, that's the that's the power of Linux. Right. Oh, I see.

394
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:30,860
So he's using system D to orchestrate just like when to kick off a script or something like that.

395
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:35,860
Yeah. When it starts, it'll, you know, kind of set that. And then when it stops, it'll set things back.

396
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:41,860
Back in my day, we used cron. Yeah, that's one option to cron is bad.

397
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:48,860
You want to take Danny's? Well, Danny might find that last tip handy because he's shopping for a new laptop.

398
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:58,860
I'm a longtime Mac user who's dabbled with Linux since 2006. I need a new laptop and was wanting to run Linux Mint Cinnamon or Manjaro KDE.

399
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:02,860
But I also need to run some older Mac apps like Adobe CS5.

400
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:08,860
Should I make sure I buy Intel or is AMD OK if I use something like Quick EMU?

401
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:15,860
I'd love to buy MacBook Air M1 if I can afford it. But does Quick EMU work on it as well?

402
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:23,860
Thanks for any help, Danny. Hmm. At first when he said I wanted I want either Linux Mint Cinnamon or Manjaro KDE, I was like, what?

403
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:32,860
That is two opposite sides. But then I realized actually kind of what I like about Cinnamon is it's kind of like some of the best stuff about KDE and a GTK desktop.

404
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:36,860
So then I started it started to click. I still think it's kind of strange, though.

405
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:39,860
It's a pretty big dichotomy between Mint and Manjaro.

406
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:44,860
So he may want to revisit exactly what he wants out of a distribution and consider Fedora.

407
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,860
Hey, sometimes you like what you like.

408
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:54,860
You know, if you get a CPU that supports the right virtualization extensions, which is pretty much most all of them now for desktops and laptops, it should work either way.

409
00:40:54,860 --> 00:41:02,860
AMD or Intel. I wonder, though, if you have considered if you want Adobe CS5, you didn't see what other older Mac apps.

410
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:06,860
So this may not apply. But Adobe CS5 is also available for Windows.

411
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:14,860
And Wine is probably going to be a lot better time than a whole VM, right? Because Wine means not only are you running it natively on your system,

412
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:18,860
but you're also going to have access to your local native file system.

413
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:22,860
And so that's a lot simpler to work with. And it's going to work a lot more than you'd expected on the Mac.

414
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:27,860
But you absolutely can go QuickMU on the M1 platform. It's not completely done yet.

415
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:33,860
But check out UTM. It's a virtual machine manager for Mac that sits on top of QuickMU.

416
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:39,860
And we have our QMU and we have a link in the show notes and they tout Linux support in there.

417
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:45,860
It looks basic, but covering most of what you'd want from something like this.

418
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:49,860
And it absolutely can run Mac OS. That's maybe one of the advantages.

419
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,860
But you have to be on the M1 system.

420
00:41:51,860 --> 00:42:03,860
So perhaps it's a future scenario where you get Asahi Linux or some Asahi Linux enabled distribution on there and then you could install UTM and have a go.

421
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:06,860
Or use UTM and Mac OS and run Linux in that and run Windows in that.

422
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:13,860
I would strongly also look at the System76 Lemur Pro. I'd also consider the Framework laptop.

423
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:17,860
Oh yeah, Framework would be good. Their marketplace just opened. It seems like that's rolling out nicely.

424
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:21,860
Yeah. XPS 13 perennial option, check those out.

425
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:26,860
What was that laptop that you tried out, that gaming laptop that I think what Dylan has now?

426
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah. The Asus.

427
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:32,860
Yeah, the Asus, the G14. It's like one rev behind.

428
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:39,860
But it's got a decent RTX 2060 or 3060 in there and it has a 120Hz screen.

429
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:44,860
And as long as you're using something that's got like kernel 512 or 513, everything works out of the box.

430
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,860
Dylan's been really happy with it.

431
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,860
So, Manjaro KDE might work?

432
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:53,860
Yeah, yeah, that totally would. I don't think, I definitely want to double check Mint because I don't think

433
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:57,860
2004 based distros work out of the box on the G14.

434
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:03,860
But anything a little newer, like a newer version of POP or newer or 2110 Ubuntu, that would totally work.

435
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,860
That's totally doable.

436
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:09,860
We got several recommendations for different YouTube archival tools.

437
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,860
That was pretty nice.

438
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:17,860
Fefe sent in his. It's called YTCC and it's a command line tool to keep track of your favorite playlists on YouTube

439
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:20,860
and then archive them to custom folders based on your settings.

440
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:21,860
We'll have a link to that in the show notes.

441
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:27,860
He says it's command line only, but you set up the playlist you want to track and then you run it as a cron job

442
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:35,860
or maybe a unit in system D and it will go fetch new videos just periodically for you and store them locally.

443
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:38,860
Yeah, it can be YouTube channels, SoundCloud, RSS feeds.

444
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:41,860
And I love that this is kind of just a standalone tool.

445
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:42,860
You know, maybe you want a whole system.

446
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:45,860
But if you want to roll something yourself, you've kind of gotten to automation.

447
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,860
You want to do some of that yourself.

448
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:50,860
YTCC might just be a nice piece of that.

449
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:52,860
Hmm, very much.

450
00:43:52,860 --> 00:44:00,860
And I was thinking about this is I wish we had a way in Matrix to have like maybe there is, but not a Wiki per se.

451
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:05,860
But wouldn't it be amazing if we had a simple way to submit things like this that the audience sends us

452
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:11,860
and keep a list in Matrix somewhere and maybe the other pics that we do just like a pics room we make somewhere.

453
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:17,860
Yeah, it needs the key would be some buddy would have to be able to maintain it because these lists always,

454
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:22,860
always end up maintained ever every single list that any podcast ever starts.

455
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:23,860
It's not just us.

456
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:26,860
Eventually it gets unmaintained.

457
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:29,860
And I'd love to find a solution to that.

458
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:31,860
Probably something with the blockchain.

459
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,860
Brent, do you want to take our last email from Marcel?

460
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,860
Marcel has created a neat tool as well.

461
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:41,860
He writes, I wanted to share this system status message of the day generator I made with a friend.

462
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:45,860
And of course, it's written in rust.

463
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:49,860
I don't know if you click through the link that he sent us Brent, but it's beautiful.

464
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:57,860
You log into your box and his message of the day generator gives you a beautifully formatted weather report.

465
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:06,860
It shows you what your uptime is, if your SSL start is active, your file system usage, the last couple of logins.

466
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:10,860
And if you have failed a ban, it'll give you like a super brief summary of failed a ban.

467
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:12,860
And the last time that was checked.

468
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:20,860
And it man, it's like one of these things that I just love because it's a simple rust app with zero runtime dependencies.

469
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:22,860
And it just looks great.

470
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,860
So we obviously have to put this on the new server West.

471
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,860
Oh, yeah, I think so.

472
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:30,860
I mean, it looks so shiny, a nice reminder every time you log in and rust.

473
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:37,860
I kind of love in the read me here, the author says, I got stuck in dependency hell one too many times trying to update interpreted alternatives.

474
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,860
E.g. something like Python, probably.

475
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:42,860
And that's how it ended up in rust.

476
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:43,860
That's great.

477
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:51,860
You know, I kind of got back into having something in my message of the day, which shows up when you first log into the console or when you first open up a terminal.

478
00:45:51,860 --> 00:46:03,860
And I was using Geruda Linux and they auto start neo fetch and give you the neo fetch output, which is great, but takes a beat every now and then to do its analysis and run.

479
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:05,860
And of course, you know, I'm a speed hound.

480
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:09,860
So what I like about what Marcel's built here is it's so simple and it's so fast.

481
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:13,860
It really by the time your terminal is done, it's loaded and it gives you that output.

482
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:19,860
It's it's really choice and it's in the A.U.R.

483
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:25,860
I want to take just a bit here and mention that our friends over at Cloud Guru have a certified entry level Python programmer certification course.

484
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:33,860
Python power so much of what we often talk about on this show and getting a solid entry level Python understanding is invaluable.

485
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:39,860
And why not get certified in the process if you want a cloud guru has the certified entry level Python programmer certification,

486
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:45,860
a great way to learn about Python data types, control flow structures, data collections, functions and generators and a lot more.

487
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:53,860
By the time you complete the course, you should feel more than comfortable taking and passing the certified entry level Python programmer certification exam.

488
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:57,860
And more importantly, you'll have a good understanding of the fundamentals of Python programming.

489
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:09,860
We'll have a link in the sponsored section of the show notes or you can go to cloud guru dot com and search for a certified entry level Python programmer certification, a cloud guru dot com.

490
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:16,860
Well, Chris, I thought you might need just one more rust pick today. Somehow these have been sneaking in all episode.

491
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:23,860
Not that I'm complaining, but this one also involves wire guard.

492
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:32,860
Enter one ton across platform user space wire guard port forwarder that requires no system network configurations.

493
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:38,860
What? How can this be a thing, Wes? How can you set up a wire guard VPN with no network configuration?

494
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:44,860
Is it just like a user space go app that has to get it? It's still creating a network connection. I don't understand.

495
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:51,860
Yeah. So the use case here is let's say you have an existing wire guard end point, something like a router running wire guard.

496
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:55,860
And you have a peer on the wire guard network that's running a TCP server.

497
00:47:55,860 --> 00:48:00,860
If you want to be able to access that TCP service from a second computer, that's not part of your wire guard setup.

498
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:03,860
And for some reason, you can't install wire guard on.

499
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:10,860
Maybe you don't have root access. Maybe it's some server that you really don't want to install things on or, you know, it's just not blessed in some way.

500
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:13,860
Yeah, sure. That's where one ton enters the picture.

501
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:22,860
And it's using a bunch of neat libraries in rust that basically implements its own user space TCP stack to make this magic happen.

502
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:27,860
Oh, wow. That must have been a hell of a project. That's impressive.

503
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:39,860
This reminds me a lot of that tool we talked about years ago, sShuttle, that made sort of a quasi VPN connection through SSH without needing any super fancy setup.

504
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:41,860
But this sounds so much more elegant.

505
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:45,860
Yeah, I haven't had a chance to give it a shot yet, but I definitely will.

506
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:54,860
So small TCP is the TCP stack they're using. And then it's it's also using boring ton, which is that cloud flare rust implementation of wire guard.

507
00:48:54,860 --> 00:49:03,860
So much rust. It's ridiculous. I can't even anymore. I feel like this is the productification. I'm trying to think of the right term.

508
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:11,860
This is what we expected to start happening around wire guard once it got mainlined and we started to see wire guard filter out into the general population.

509
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:16,860
Something else that comes to mind that the audience is super excited about right now is tail scale.

510
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:25,860
And that's another product that truly is like a product with a service and a good user experience that sits on top of wire guard.

511
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:32,860
Now we have this one ton which lets you participate in a wire guard network without even having administrative access to your box.

512
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:35,860
I could see how that'd be super useful in a corporate environment.

513
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:39,860
This is really neat. And there's other products out there built on wire guard.

514
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:43,860
And it's sort of like it's like the it's like the sort of valve certified stamp for the deck.

515
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:50,860
This is like the you can trust the crypto stamp for a VPN product, assuming they're not using a bastard implementation of wire guard.

516
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:54,860
It means I can kind of trust the fundamentals of the software is running on top of.

517
00:49:54,860 --> 00:50:07,860
And I like the idea of of that specifically, because then I don't have to worry about if tail scales done some weird crypto that they can crack or they can read or or is going to get broken by some script kitty.

518
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:13,860
Because I know that they're using something that's tried and true and test. And if it gets updated, that update goes out everywhere.

519
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:18,860
And that makes these products, I think, to to me, just a little more trustworthy. I love to see this.

520
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:24,860
It's also kind of the you know, one of the reasons we love open source is like we can we can have this shared base that we all get to use.

521
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:32,860
And that just levels the playing field and raises things up so that, yeah, a whole bunch of other parties can build neat stuff on top without having to reinvent the wheel each time.

522
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:37,860
Yeah, I mean, and for me, you know, on Linux, like that's great. I prefer to go the route where it's built into the kernel.

523
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:40,860
I prefer to go to the route where I could use it with my other tools and all that kind of stuff.

524
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:45,860
I totally appreciate the use case for that. But I'd say with all of these, just double check that, you know,

525
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:50,860
they're not using some crazy esoteric wire guard or some crazy esoteric port or something like that.

526
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:54,860
You know, make sure it's it's good industry standard stuff. And that's a big part of the due diligence now, I think.

527
00:50:54,860 --> 00:51:01,860
So there you have it. And we'd love your picks. Let us know Linux unplugged dot com slash contact or join our telegram group, which is going all the time.

528
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:04,860
That's a Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash telegram.

529
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:08,860
You'll see several of the hosts in there throughout the week and drop links and interact with folks.

530
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:13,860
But if you absolutely want to get in the show, that contact page, that's really the way to do it.

531
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:16,860
And if you do the Twitter thing, you can also follow the show at Linux unplugged.

532
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:20,860
The network is at Jupiter signal where you can get notifications about the entire network.

533
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:25,860
Yes, there are other podcasts on the network and they release throughout the week.

534
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:28,860
This is a self hosted week, too, I think. So at the end of the week, towards the end of the week,

535
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:32,860
there's going to be a quarter radio first and then there'll be a new self hosted.

536
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:37,860
And if you if you follow us on Twitter, you find out so much to look forward to.

537
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:41,860
Yeah, there's also one of those fancy combined show feeds, right?

538
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:44,860
Where do people get that? That's a good idea. Go get the all shows feed.

539
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:50,860
In fact, if you go to Jupiter broadcasting dot com, there's a shows menu there with all the feeds for all the shows listed, including the all shows feed.

540
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:55,860
So that's really the pro tip. All the Carter all in one. It's up to you. That's right. That's right.

541
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:59,860
And you're always welcome to join us live. We do the show on Tuesdays at noon, Pacific three p.m.

542
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:03,860
Eastern at J.B. Live TV. We'd love to have you. See you next week.

543
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:09,860
Same bad time. Same bad station. Indeed. Go get yourself some Linux action news.

544
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,860
Go find out what's going on every single week in the world of Linux and open source.

545
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:19,860

00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:54,860
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday.

551
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:23,860
All right, J.B. Titles dot com, go pick our show title.

552
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:28,860
Brent, it's so nice to have you back. You've been traveling. You've had incidents that have happened.

553
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:33,860
I mean, it's been a bit. I am home for the first time in like four months.

554
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:39,860
Like you're your real actual home. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. My cats are here and I'm here. It's weird.

555
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:45,860
It doesn't it doesn't really feel like home anymore. I got to say that's the strangest feeling.

556
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:47,860
But I got to say, it feels good to be back.

557
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:57,860
And I also want to say one of the crazy incidents that I ran into was I got into quite a scary car crash a few weeks after our Denver meetup.

558
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:05,860
And I was near Denver when that happened. And I just wanted to say huge thanks to the whole J.B. community.

559
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:16,860
I got so wonderfully overwhelmed with messages from people in different ways, just saying, hey, man, hope you're doing all right.

560
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:27,860
And so got tons of love, lots from the self-hosted Discord, some from the Telegram group and people just messaging me just to say, hey, hope you're OK.

561
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:33,860
And I really appreciate that. It's exactly what I needed at that time. So thank you. Thank you, everyone. Super, super appreciate it.

562
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:37,860
I'm totally fine, by the way, miraculously. So I'll be here more regularly.

563
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:44,860
That is really good. Yeah. When we saw the pictures, it was one of those is one of those accidents you look at and you're like, how did he walk away from that?

564
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:53,860
There's not much of a car left there. And for anyone who's been in a car crash, this is my first, which I would not recommend it by any means.

565
00:54:53,860 --> 00:55:00,860
And it just is a scary thing. And it's one of those crashes for me where it just replayed in my head for about two weeks.

566
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:06,860
So it's a pretty bad one. I bet. Do you even know a few weeks later?

567
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:25,860
Yeah, I definitely do. I'm physically totally fine, but I got to say, like, super traumatic. And Chrissy and I were talking about how exactly the accident I had was one of your worst nightmares, which is, you know, traveling down the interstate and something just another car just appears in front of you.

568
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:30,860
There's not a single thing you can do except crash directly into them going at highway speeds.

569
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:41,860
And, you know, I was driving a Subaru at the time, and I'm pretty sure that thing kept me alive. And so thank you to the technology and those things.

570
00:55:41,860 --> 00:56:01,860
Thank you to the engineers at Subaru. They kept Brent alive.
