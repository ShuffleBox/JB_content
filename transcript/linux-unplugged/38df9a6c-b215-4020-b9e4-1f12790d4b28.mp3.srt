00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,400
Before we get the show rolling today,

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,140
I'm wondering if any of you in the Mamba Room

3
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,480
are working on any cool projects

4
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,760
we can share with the class.

5
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,680
I've been playing with some new things this week.

6
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,840
Oh yeah, what?

7
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,520
Well, an old thing renewed,

8
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:14,760
so I've been working on bringing Ubuntu MATE 18.04

9
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,100
to the Raspberry Pi 2, 3, and 3 Plus.

10
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,500
But in doing so, I have reacquainted myself

11
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,240
with SystemD Endspawn,

12
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,080
and I'm having a little love-in

13
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,120
with SystemD Endspawn this week.

14
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,680
Wes talks about this all the time.

15
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,520
This is like a way to kind of do like little mini containers

16
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,680
with using nothing but SystemD, right?

17
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,600
Yeah, it's a part of the SystemD tool set

18
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,040
that is for container management,

19
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,920
and it can do most of the things

20
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,120
most of the container tools can do.

21
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,740
But what I've been doing is pairing it up

22
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,720
with a piece of software called QMU User Static,

23
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,720
which is a fast processor emulator for ARM and MIPS

24
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,480
and a whole bunch, and PowerPC,

25
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,400
a whole bunch of sort of unusual processor architectures,

26
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,560
and I've been able to create containers

27
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,980
of ARM 32-bit and ARM 64-bit,

28
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,880
and actually do my build and testing

29
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,000
on my Intel workstation using foreign architecture

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,120
containers, even taking it to the point

31
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,280
where you can bind mount into the container

32
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,320
for things like X authority and pulse audio

33
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,400
and the display environment variables

34
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,920
and the X socket, and you can actually launch

35
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,520
X applications for ARM inside the container

36
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,200
and run them on your host operating system,

37
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,200
so it's really great for sort of debugging

38
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,680
and getting stuff tested.

39
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,040
Holy smokes, what's the speed impact like?

40
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,760
It's negligible overhead, this one certainly is,

41
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,400
but you know, I've done this sort of thing

42
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,200
inside CH routes in the past,

43
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,360
but there's some overhead you have to manage there yourself,

44
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,920
whereas system dnspawn does all of the isolation

45
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,320
for you automatically, and you don't have to do things

46
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,400
like binding to dev PTS and all that kind of monkeying

47
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,920
around it, it caters for that,

48
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,320
but in terms of performance, it's brilliant.

49
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,320
For me, operating these things and running

50
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,320
quite complicated build environments inside them,

51
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,960
it's like native performance.

52
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,960
A lot of fun when you bring up things like system monitors

53
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,520
and it tells you it's ARM 32-bit running

54
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,040
on an i9-9900K with 64 gigabytes of RAM,

55
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,800
but you know, it's, which I posted on Twitter

56
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,080
and had a few people looking sideways at the screenshot,

57
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,400
but yeah, it's a really potent combination

58
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,360
of QMU user static and system dnspawn.

59
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,960
That is pretty great, that's a hell of a way

60
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,800
to start a show.

61
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,680
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 291, for March 3rd, 2019.

62
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,760
Oh, hi there, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show

63
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,600
that this week is packed full of community news.

64
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,720
Looking at the price of the cloud,

65
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,720
has a bit of a rant about our home folders,

66
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,880
a few pics for you, and much, much more.

67
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,840
My name is Chris.

68
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,920
My name is Wes.

69
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,080
Hello, Mr. Payne, and this week,

70
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,840
I'm super excited to say in studio,

71
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,920
joining me is the CEO and founder of Linux Academy,

72
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,760
Anthony James.

73
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,600
Hello, Anthony.

74
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,240
Hey, thanks for having me, it's exciting to be here.

75
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,640
You got a nice little spot set up.

76
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,760
Do you like what I built here?

77
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,040
I do, very relaxing.

78
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,760
I know, the final piece really was that lamp.

79
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,120
That lamp really did it.

80
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,320
Not the giant penguin?

81
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,480
That was the first thing I put in here, actually.

82
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,320
Got to.

83
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,480
Coming up on this week's episode,

84
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,040
we got a really special episode,

85
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,440
because not only is Anthony here,

86
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,160
but we're joined by an outstanding cast of characters

87
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,040
in that Mumble Room.

88
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,200
Time, appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

89
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,040
Hey, everyone.

90
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,880
Good evening.

91
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,480
Hello, hello, virtual lug.

92
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,320
Yeah, in the room today, we got Bashful, Brent,

93
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:09,040
Cheese Bacon, Daniel Foray, Popey, and Wimpy,

94
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,680
all joining us to gather around the community news,

95
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,200
to curvuts about our home folders,

96
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,960
and to talk about potentially a realistic,

97
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,520
a real possible video editor for Linux.

98
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,360
We'll see.

99
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,760
We'll give you two different picks that we like right now.

100
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,320
You can walk away with at least one of them that will work.

101
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,440
But before we get to any of that,

102
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,720
let's kick off the community news with a bit of an update

103
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,240
for you Firefox users, which I know is a lot of you

104
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,000
out there.

105
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,280
Firefox 67 is going to take a new step

106
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,440
to help improve memory usage.

107
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,920
This has been something that you could do via an extension

108
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,280
for a long time now.

109
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,800
But Mozilla plans to introduce a new feature in Firefox 67

110
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,800
that will aim to improve the browser's memory usage

111
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,320
by essentially offloading tabs you don't use very often.

112
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,240
It's a pretty good idea.

113
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,600
Yeah, I think so.

114
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,080
Interestingly, the bug's been around for eight years,

115
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,880
and work kind of just started.

116
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,120
But as someone who does use those extensions

117
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,120
on another browser I won't name sometimes,

118
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,720
this seems like a great thing to have by default.

119
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,280
Now, right now, it's basically going to occur in low memory

120
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,720
situations, and they've got a simple priority list

121
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,800
to determine what actually gets unloaded.

122
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,200
So first it's regular tabs, then pin tabs,

123
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,560
then regular tabs that play audio,

124
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,000
and pin tabs that play audio, which

125
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,400
seems reasonable to me that'll probably

126
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,560
unload the things that you're not actually using.

127
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,560
Yeah, yeah, I could see the ones playing audio

128
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,520
would probably be, if you're letting them play,

129
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,560
you're probably using that tab, something like a YouTube video

130
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,440
or something playing in the background.

131
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,000
It is available right now in Nightly.

132
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,640
Why are we not letting the kernel do the right thing?

133
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,280
Because it already knows which pages of memory

134
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,640
you're using and which you're not,

135
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,560
and throws out the things you're not using.

136
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,880
Why are we re-implementing this at the application layer

137
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,560
as well?

138
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,800
Us platform compatibility.

139
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,080
Well, there's that, I think, in part

140
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,480
because they have to take whatever steps they can

141
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,680
to reduce the criticism they get for the memory usage.

142
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,240
They can't just wait around for the operating system to kill,

143
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,200
because people will look at their process list

144
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,480
and go, three gigabytes, what the heck is going on?

145
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,080
So they're not resolving the issue

146
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,040
by reducing the amount of RAM they're using.

147
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,600
They're throwing stuff out that they

148
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,480
think you might not be using, but you might actually

149
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,160
come back and need to use later on, a bit like swapping.

150
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,800
Yeah, that's exactly what they're doing.

151
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,440
Yeah, I'm not saying it's brilliant,

152
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,360
but it does seem like it would functionally

153
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,200
fix a bit of the problem.

154
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,880
I do kind of like, for the Chrome plug-in I use,

155
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,760
I kind of like, and maybe it's just an illusion

156
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,680
and it would all work better done in a different way,

157
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,720
but it's nice to be able to sort of pick and choose,

158
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,600
because I can suspend stuff if I know I'm just

159
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,040
about to launch a bunch of VMs.

160
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,520
And I want to keep these tabs, but I don't need anything

161
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,760
to do with them right now.

162
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,440
And I can unsuspend the ones I want.

163
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,400
That's a good point.

164
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,060
Well, it'll be landing in Firefox 67

165
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,240
either way, which is currently scheduled

166
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,720
to be released May 14, 2009, if you are subscribed

167
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,120
to the Stable channel.

168
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,100
So that'll be coming soon.

169
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,480
Why don't we talk about Chrome?

170
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,240
Seems like only fair.

171
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,600
We got to do equal representation.

172
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,480
I'm more of a Chrome user.

173
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,120
What about you, Anthony?

174
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,800
I use Chrome.

175
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,040
Are you?

176
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,560
Yeah.

177
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,040
Yeah.

178
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,560
I've tried to switch back to Firefox.

179
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,800
Have you ever tried to do that?

180
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,080
I use that for my cross, my dual browser testing.

181
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,560
Sure.

182
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,440
I got them both installed.

183
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:13,840
Yeah.

184
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,280
Oh, yeah.

185
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:14,760
Oh, yeah.

186
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,460
It feels, I don't know why, this is completely arbitrary.

187
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,400
It feels chunky.

188
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,320
Yeah, I feel like Chrome scrolls smoother,

189
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,160
and the pages load in a little smoother.

190
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,200
So the perception is it's smoother.

191
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:26,800
Yeah.

192
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,000
I know that Firefox has made a lot of improvements.

193
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,320
So I like to follow it.

194
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,200
I do keep it.

195
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,840
It's my second browser.

196
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,840
I usually have three web browsers on a computer,

197
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,840
and it's my second one.

198
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,400
What's your third web browser?

199
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,000
It depends on the system I'm on.

200
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,800
So if I'm on, like, Epiphany or GNOME Web would be a go-to.

201
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,320
Or if I'm on Plasma, a lot of times

202
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,800
I actually use Opera as my third browser.

203
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,880
If I'm on the Mac, I'll use Safari as a third browser.

204
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,000
So it just kind of depends on the desktop I'm on.

205
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,920
What about you?

206
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,400
Are you a three-browser man?

207
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:58,920
Yeah.

208
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,360
I use Firefox, Brave, and Opera.

209
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,040
OK.

210
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,840
Brave, huh?

211
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,280
Yeah, you know, I should work Brave in.

212
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,280
Oh, my god, you should.

213
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:13,560
For about three years now, Brave is my only browser on my phone.

214
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,400
So I disable and uninstall other browsers.

215
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,880
That's the only browser I've used for the longest time on my phone.

216
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:27,480
And I use Brave on my PCs for anything personal stuff-related.

217
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,760
So I use Firefox for work, and I use Brave for my home stuff.

218
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:36,200
And Opera is my, I want to test how things are looking and working

219
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,360
in another browser.

220
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,720
So what is it about Brave that draws you into it?

221
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:46,680
On the phone, it's because you get basically the same user experience

222
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,320
and reliability of the Chrome browser, because Brave is based on that.

223
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,120
But you get all of the ad stripping and privacy guarding

224
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,320
baked into the browser.

225
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,160
So you don't need to mess around with ad blockers.

226
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,960
You know, you don't need to root your device

227
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,560
and put ad blockers on at a system level.

228
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,940
The browser takes care of it for you.

229
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,240
And you can opt into their program of actually choosing

230
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,960
how you monetize in at the sites that you want to monetize based

231
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,320
on their value to you as an individual.

232
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,320
And the same is true for the desktop, too.

233
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,120
You know, it just mops up all of that cruft

234
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,600
that you have that is just pervasive on every website that you visit now.

235
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,160
OK.

236
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,920
That's a compelling reason to try it out.

237
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,160
I could add that as a third.

238
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,000
I could see that.

239
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,160
I was a fully paid up Chrome guy.

240
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:40,000
And then I think you convinced me to try out Firefox some time ago.

241
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,600
And I switched to Firefox, and that's it.

242
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,320
I stayed on it.

243
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,760
Once they figured out how to do container tabs properly,

244
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,320
that's a game changer for Firefox, container tabs.

245
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:49,920
Yes.

246
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,680
Yes.

247
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,440
That was the missing feature that I needed

248
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,880
to be able to successfully switch back to Firefox.

249
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,880
And I think I've been on Firefox again for just a touch over a year.

250
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,240
So whenever that feature got introduced.

251
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,920
Yeah, that's one of the great features.

252
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,480
And it's the only way I'm even like halfway

253
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,280
feeling comfortable ever going to Facebook

254
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,160
is because I have a container for it.

255
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,440
So I was actually queuing us up to talk about Chrome OS

256
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,640
because there's interesting things developing over there.

257
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,200
Two things that we picked out this week.

258
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:25,120
Number one is on Chrome OS 74, they seem

259
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,520
to be putting a lot of effort into improving the experience of running

260
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,420
Linux apps on Chromebook.

261
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,640
So a feature they recently added is the ability

262
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,720
to actually run desktop Linux applications on a Chromebook.

263
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,360
We've talked about this on and off.

264
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,720
And with the new version, they're making it a little more

265
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,820
like a real desktop application.

266
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,080
You're going to get audio playback.

267
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,800
You'll get hardware acceleration to be able to watch videos

268
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,260
because that was a challenge before.

269
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,420
You couldn't listen to music.

270
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,920
You couldn't watch videos.

271
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,680
Now, don't get your hopes up, Wes, because we're not

272
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,240
going to be podcasting from Chromebooks.

273
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,920
There's no support for audio in.

274
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,680
Oh, but I'd already made plans and bought several Chromebooks.

275
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,760
Whoops.

276
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,400
I kind of do feel like it's starting to get time

277
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,680
to get a Chromebook, though.

278
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,320
So what, this is 10 years after they come out with Chromebooks?

279
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,240
Yeah, yeah.

280
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,480
But now they're finally running desktop Linux applications.

281
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,960
They're going to support sound and audio.

282
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,680
I could see that.

283
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,200
I don't know.

284
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,280
I could see trying it out.

285
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,840
I was thinking about for my wife, who's writing a book right now,

286
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,060
and she just needs a system with a keyboard.

287
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,000
And she's actually ended up preferring

288
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,400
writing in Google Docs.

289
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,520
I think she's crazy.

290
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,800
I can't stand Google Docs.

291
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,680
But she loves it.

292
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,280
It's definitely a class of user that

293
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,320
would benefit from using a Chromebook with the added

294
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,160
functionality of having a catalog of Linux software.

295
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,320
But for me, there isn't a Chromebook

296
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,660
that's manufactured that has got the raw processing

297
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,740
power and storage that I need to do what I need to do.

298
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,680
And I imagine that that's true not just for developers,

299
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,640
but for people that are working with video or high end

300
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,160
photography as well.

301
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,040
Oh, for sure.

302
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,360
Sometimes you just need a little more oomph.

303
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,320
Does that mean that creative professionals and developers

304
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,600
are going to become more and more marginalized

305
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,860
by their hardware choices in the future?

306
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,480
I think that's what's already happening on the Mac side.

307
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,280
I think you're already seeing that reality on the Mac side.

308
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,280
That's why MacBooks have four ports at best.

309
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,480
And they offer them in like three sizes.

310
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,280
And it's a total reduction of choice over there.

311
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,560
That's something that my co-host, Michael Dominic,

312
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,480
had to struggle with quite a bit and ended up

313
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,520
switching the majority of his workload over to Linux

314
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,480
because of the limited hardware choices

315
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,360
that he needed just to be able to build software.

316
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,640
I think it is a big problem.

317
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,880
I don't know if you stepped into an Apple store recently,

318
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,440
but they offer workshops in the store, right?

319
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,480
Recently, my girlfriend went in to go do a video editing

320
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,400
workshop.

321
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,560
And all of their stuff is focused on iPad and iOS apps

322
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,640
on iPad.

323
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,360
They don't have glasses for video editing

324
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,920
on their professional hardware in their store anymore.

325
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,880
Wow.

326
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,520
Crazy.

327
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,200
I wouldn't blame them.

328
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,560
I'm struck by how often when I'm traveling,

329
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,800
and I see people at the airport or in an airplane that

330
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,120
are using iPads, and the diversity of types of people

331
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,960
from young children with these big rubber

332
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,680
cases around their iPad to individuals

333
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,880
that have got to be in their late 70s to early 80s

334
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,120
that are all joining the Wi-Fi network.

335
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,600
They're browsing the media that's available on the plane.

336
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,680
They're all able to use this device.

337
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,400
And I've never really experienced anything

338
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,520
like that in my life.

339
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,200
In fact, I remember when the iPad first started selling,

340
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,700
one of the things that was remarkable

341
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:47,320
was that Angela's parents hate technology.

342
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,880
They have one PC that they have to have to do business stuff.

343
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,760
And they've really taken to the iPad.

344
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,080
They have several iPads now.

345
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,200
And it seemed to cross a barrier for people that don't normally

346
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,000
use technology were able to pick up the iPad.

347
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,600
And so if I was Apple, I'd be looking at that going,

348
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,920
that's a huge market.

349
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,680
That is a way bigger market potential

350
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,120
than the Mac ever was.

351
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,360
Because the Mac fundamentally is a computer with a file system

352
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,560
and computer problems and accessories

353
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,040
that aren't compatible, all this stuff

354
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,240
that you just don't really have.

355
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,120
The accessory is either certified by Apple

356
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,000
or it doesn't work on the iOS land.

357
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,040
Well, I hate to say it, but if you think about it,

358
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,840
the reduction of choice forces simplicity,

359
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,920
which for the mass market and what they need to do,

360
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,360
specifically now what you can do with the video editing

361
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,720
on an iPad, it's very opinionated on how you do it.

362
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,560
You don't have all the extra applications on there,

363
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,600
the extra things that cause issues for the components.

364
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,280
It's more limited, but what works just works, right?

365
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,440
What's the major workflow they're trying to solve?

366
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,800
And then for every other workflow,

367
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,720
that's 10% video editors, high-level video production,

368
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,040
high-level graphic production, so on and so forth.

369
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,680
Right.

370
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,820
And I think the Chromebooks are eating

371
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,680
into another area of this market,

372
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,480
like an area that is more like Hadia's workload right now,

373
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,120
which her primary thing she wants

374
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,280
is she wants a very reliable computer with a decent keyboard

375
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,720
that gives her good access to Google Docs,

376
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,720
that if she goes somewhere to do a presentation,

377
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,920
she can hook up to a projector and it's going to work.

378
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,760
And if she comes back here and picks up,

379
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,280
she has a laptop running Plasma, Kubuntu,

380
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,520
then she can open that up and get access to the same doc.

381
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,780
And she can open up on her phone and read the same doc.

382
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,120
That's what her main use case is.

383
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,800
For her, it's kind of hard not to say, well, that's a Chromebook.

384
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,960
Well, now she has audio in her presentation.

385
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,460
Right.

386
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,560
That'll work.

387
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,120
Yeah.

388
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,840
She could install Open Office Presenter or Libre Office

389
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,360
Presenter or whatever and give a presentation.

390
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,440
You know, what's interesting is, and you probably already

391
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,280
know the answer to this, because honestly, I've

392
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,360
never been that interested in the Chromebooks to look into it.

393
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,960
But for what they're trying to do

394
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,120
to get the Linux apps and components working on there,

395
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,460
and for as bare minimum and as configurable

396
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,500
you can make a similar lightweight desktop for that,

397
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,920
it's interesting they decided just

398
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,000
to go a whole route of a whole operating system.

399
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,840
Because it's now almost like, hey, all you need is a browser.

400
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,100
Except for that's not true.

401
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:07,960
You need these other things.

402
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,240
So we're just going to add it in there where it already exists.

403
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:10,720
Isn't that fun?

404
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,220
Yeah.

405
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,280
I think that's about reaching the developer market.

406
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,120
I think it's about trying to reach a more technical audience

407
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,720
and bringing, like they've reached a certain saturation

408
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,560
with the Chromebook.

409
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,720
And now they want to get that market that maybe needs

410
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,560
a text editor, wants their favorite terminal,

411
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,400
maybe needs GIMP, and wants to be able to SSH into their box

412
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,080
that they're working on or something like that.

413
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,580
Right.

414
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,840
Just enough technical tools to keep you placated.

415
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,360
Yeah.

416
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,780
Or maybe Android Studio.

417
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,280
Maybe they're targeting Android developers in the future.

418
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,720
Make an Android development workstation out of Chrome OS.

419
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,520
That's true.

420
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,000
I wonder if the dumbed down devices

421
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,360
are going to maintain that hold as the generations move on.

422
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,280
Looking at the people who've grown up with technology

423
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,760
and whether they're going to want to be able to directly access

424
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,800
the power versus having that dumbed down experience, which

425
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,520
sure, maybe was great for my dad who's 70 and a bald cowboy who

426
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,000
loves it.

427
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,720
But what about the people that grew up with it?

428
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,440
Wait, is your dad really a cowboy?

429
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,160
Yeah, that's a whole other story.

430
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,600
Yeah, I grew up in the prairies.

431
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,920
Canada has cowboys in prairies?

432
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,560
Oh, yeah.

433
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,560
We got lots.

434
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,200
Lots and lots.

435
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,240
Tons.

436
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,000
I thought cowboys.

437
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,240
Whole provinces.

438
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,200
I don't understand this.

439
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,240
I got to learn the history of cowboys.

440
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,020
Even in British Columbia, there is a very large cattle industry.

441
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,240
And then you just start going east, all the way to Manitoba,

442
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,560
all the way into Ontario.

443
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,360
It's full cattle country.

444
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,760
Of course.

445
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,280
It makes total sense.

446
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,400
Can we think seriously about the phrase dumbed down?

447
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,800
You look how powerful the iPhone and Android devices

448
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,000
and the iPad is.

449
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,480
There are people now being empowered to be able to do stuff

450
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,400
like video editing, or even just like simple photo editing,

451
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,560
or full-on design with an Apple Pencil and iPad Pro,

452
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,920
stuff that was absolutely not possible 10 years ago

453
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,320
on a bog-standard PC, or even a high-end PC,

454
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,360
or stuff that would have been very difficult and out

455
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,440
of the price range of mere mortals.

456
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,080
I think dumbing down is the wrong phrase,

457
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:11,080
because just because we think that we had the capability

458
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,240
to do those things a few years ago,

459
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,480
there's a much wider and diverse range of the population who

460
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,920
are enabled with these devices and are

461
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,320
able to do stuff that they would never have dreamed

462
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,840
doing before with a thing that they

463
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,680
can carry around in their pocket or a thing

464
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,080
they can put in their purse.

465
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,000
That's a good point.

466
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,480
I guess after having said dumbed down and hearing that context,

467
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,440
I actually agree with you.

468
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,560
Yeah, I can agree completely too in the photography space,

469
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,400
because I've seen huge, massive swaths of populations

470
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,600
getting amazing cameras in their pockets.

471
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,200
And my initial reaction many, many years ago

472
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,600
was like, oh, as a photographer, all these people

473
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,880
are taking photos that feel substandard to what

474
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,440
I'm creating.

475
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,140
But now these days, that perspective

476
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,120
has completely changed.

477
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,920
And I think enabling anyone to be creative in any way,

478
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,520
whether it be photography, or design, or even some audio

479
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,720
stuff, it feels like everybody can

480
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,680
get a voice for much less buy-in to this technology.

481
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,120
It's really a huge success for the population.

482
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,160
It feels like a reset.

483
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,280
We've gone along an uphill, a bit like Moore's law.

484
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,160
It's going up, and up, and up, and up, and up.

485
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,680
And then we've kind of gone jump down a tiny bit in power.

486
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,000
These devices are very powerful, but they're not i9.

487
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,120
And we've kind of gone down.

488
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,960
But we've gone up in usability and up

489
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,120
with the creative capability of these devices

490
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,440
and the empowerment that these things give you,

491
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,280
even if we haven't gone full on with power.

492
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,160
But that will come.

493
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,320
I think every year a new Apple chip comes out,

494
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,400
a new Qualcomm chip comes out that's

495
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,760
more powerful than everything that's ever been before it.

496
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,240
I think we've just had a bit of a reset for a short period,

497
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,480
and it will climb again.

498
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,000
Maybe.

499
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,080
I hate to compare computers to cars.

500
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,320
But if you look at cars and you consider

501
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,920
how much has changed in the last 50 years

502
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,520
on what's accessible under the hood,

503
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,800
or how complicated they are, or how productized they are,

504
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,800
you could see technology going that general trend, where

505
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,120
the hood is a little more welded shut, as the old saying goes.

506
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,680
But the consumer isn't disadvantaged to say.

507
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,640
They're disadvantaged in terms of getting access

508
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,480
to those components, but they're enabled

509
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,480
by the plentiful accessibility to the technology,

510
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,440
the reduction in cost, the market options.

511
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,640
Like there's other things that improve when

512
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,520
other things are taken away.

513
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,880
And I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.

514
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,440
But I, having, and I've made this point on the show before,

515
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,520
but having worked in education, then taking 10 years off,

516
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:51,960
and then going back, there was a huge, huge gap in the interest

517
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,160
the students had.

518
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:58,640
We could fill three labs of students, 30 students each

519
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,160
in each lab, the first time I was in the education system.

520
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,840
When I came back, it was a team of five students.

521
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,720
So can I jump on this car analogy real quick?

522
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,140
I don't know if this makes sense.

523
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,140
It makes sense in my head, so follow with me here.

524
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,280
So it's a new baseline.

525
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,240
So I can talk to this, to the videos.

526
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,240
We'll start with the car.

527
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,640
If you think about it, 30 years ago,

528
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,200
even when I was growing up, 18, 19 years ago as a teenager,

529
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,000
it used to be the coolest thing ever

530
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,120
to be able to change an oil or change a headlight, right?

531
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,160
Something you would want to know.

532
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,400
You'd get in there like, hey, I can change my oil.

533
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,560
Nowadays, you've got to take off the first part of the car

534
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,600
to be able to change oil.

535
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,740
But instead of having teenagers or whoever

536
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,280
is interested in cars, like, hey, I can change my oil,

537
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,520
they're now modding their cars from a higher standpoint

538
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,040
with this new technology implementation, right?

539
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,400
And I haven't dove much into it.

540
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,780
I've just seen some stories on it.

541
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,800
Same thing for video.

542
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,560
15 years ago, to see some of the basic iPhone editing stuff,

543
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,760
that was professional level, $10,000 to have made,

544
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,760
needed giant computers.

545
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,480
But the baseline of knowledge, the baseline of capability

546
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,480
for the upcoming generation starts off

547
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,400
with what used to seem impossible for us to achieve.

548
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,860
Now that just means, what's that next impossible step that

549
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,080
seems impossible to them that we can't even imagine?

550
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,840
Yeah, you're right.

551
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:21,200
To Popi's point, it's more people I have access to.

552
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,920
My daughter has an iPad with a 1080p stabilized camera in it.

553
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,080
She has an HD camera in her tablet.

554
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,880
I would have loved to have something like that

555
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,160
when I was six years old.

556
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,440
I always wanted to have one of those game gears that

557
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,640
plugged in the TV antenna.

558
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,500
Yeah, that would be great.

559
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,360
I remember my first car, I had to do some maintenance on it.

560
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,740
And I stripped the engine down and regrounded the valves.

561
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,200
And I put a new drive shaft on it.

562
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,720
I did loads of work on that car.

563
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,480
These days, there's no way I'm going to do that.

564
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,640
I'll throw it at a man and give him a small bag of money

565
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,960
and hope he fixes it for me.

566
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,260
But there are people out there who still want to do that.

567
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:00,240
I think that's the key, is there are still

568
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,920
people out there on Linux, for example, who still

569
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,640
like editing their Xorg.conf, whereas the vast majority

570
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,600
of people don't care about that kind of thing

571
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,660
and don't really want to do that.

572
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,080
They just want the thing to work.

573
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,800
And I think the iPad and these generations of devices

574
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,360
service a very large proportion of the population who

575
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,800
don't want to put their hands under the bonnet of a car

576
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,760
and don't want to edit an Xorg.conf.

577
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,400
They want to edit a video.

578
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,920
And this services that need perfectly.

579
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,080
We can have both, right?

580
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,040
Yeah, we live in a world where you can have iPads

581
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,120
and you can go get a Raspberry Pi to play around with.

582
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,440
But do you think that Linux can offer both?

583
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,080
I remember Linux, maybe even 10 years ago,

584
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,460
was a lot more tinkery than it is now.

585
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,280
It seems to be getting far more user friendly.

586
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,880
So do you think that we can get there and offer both for anybody

587
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,880
in the same package?

588
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,880
I feel like that's kind of a fair criticism.

589
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,280
I think that is true to a degree.

590
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,000
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

591
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,560
But I actually have a story in here

592
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:01,340
about the systemd free Debian derivative, dev1.

593
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,800
They're planning a get together this spring.

594
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,720
There's going to be a dev1 conference.

595
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,000
They call it the, I think they call it the init system

596
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,040
independence conference or something like that.

597
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,880
So there are still circles with Slack out there, Brent.

598
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,340
I mean, there's still those circles

599
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,040
that are fully empowered.

600
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,840
When they first started, we laughed at them and said,

601
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,760
they're ridiculous.

602
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,880
But this is what happens.

603
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,440
People laughed at the Marte developers

604
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,340
when Marte was first created.

605
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,840
And they pointed out, oh, they're just doing a global search

606
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,440
or a place on the GNOME 2 code base.

607
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,120
But if you get enough enthusiasts who

608
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,240
are like-minded and feel passionately about the thing

609
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,760
that they're making, then you're going

610
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,200
to get conferences arranged around that project.

611
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,320
It's inevitable.

612
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,240
And it's bad on us for laughing and pointing the finger

613
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,640
at these people who don't want systemd on their distros.

614
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,280
Fair enough, they've got the choice.

615
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,560
And we've given them the tools to make it possible.

616
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,120
They're just making use of it.

617
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,540
I think something to keep in mind

618
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,020
is the nature of operating systems and computers

619
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,520
and technologies are changing so much,

620
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,680
sticking with the car analogy, moving to electric vehicles

621
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,360
where the vehicles do not have oil to change anymore.

622
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,520
But the common thread that we really

623
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,300
need to care about is things like telemetry

624
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,480
and these connected devices and our privacy.

625
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,920
And I think those are things that we

626
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,120
need to focus on more so than what

627
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,040
are the technical underpinnings that make the thing run.

628
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,720
Yes, that's a fair point.

629
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,480
I think that is something that we, as a community,

630
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,240
are particularly good at.

631
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,000
And we are always kind of asking those questions

632
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,780
and kind of watching that kind of stuff.

633
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:38,440
It is kind of hard, though, because there's so much of it

634
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:38,920
now.

635
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,280
It's just a full spectrum.

636
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,680
And maybe I'm just feeling that way

637
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,780
because we just got out of Mobile World Congress,

638
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,960
but holy smokes.

639
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,320
So let's shift gears for a moment

640
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,000
and let's talk about some good old traditional desktop stuff.

641
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,440
Gnome 3.32 is just a few weeks away.

642
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,560
And the biggest feature we've been waiting for for quite

643
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,400
a while has landed just recently.

644
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,960
Fractional scaling just squeezed in

645
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,640
before the big freeze.

646
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,560
Oh, that's right.

647
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:11,080
It's in the Git branches now, nearly three years

648
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,760
after the bug was first opened.

649
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,600
And of course, if you're not paying attention

650
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,160
or you don't have a high DPI screen,

651
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,160
maybe you don't know what fractional scaling is.

652
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,660
But I mean, it's really exactly what

653
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,120
it sounds like, having the scaling that is a fraction,

654
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,240
not just two, three, one, whatever.

655
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,960
So you can get just the right scaling for whatever size

656
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,040
display you might have.

657
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,600
It's nice to see it.

658
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,680
And it was looking like Gnome 3.32, 3.32, as I should say,

659
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:37,120
would be another cycle without it, which would be

660
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,720
another lap for elementary OS.

661
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,880
But it looks like it snuck in.

662
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,160
Yeah, it's just nice to see constant improvements, right?

663
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:47,320
This is Gnome 3.32, is that what you said?

664
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,000
Yes.

665
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,720
So there have been as many Gnome 3 releases now

666
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,560
as there were of Gnome 2 releases.

667
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,160
Wow.

668
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,120
Soak that in for a moment.

669
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,880
Wow, it feels like it's been a long haul to get here.

670
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,800
It really does feel like it's been a long haul.

671
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,800
OK, I just have one more community news story.

672
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,360
So let's cover this one pretty quickly.

673
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,240
Because I think this is, from a big picture,

674
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,200
pretty important for Canonical.

675
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,880
I think Canonical has a good advantage

676
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,740
when it comes to Kubernetes deployments.

677
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,040
And they have an announcement this week.

678
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,760
That they do.

679
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,400
Canonical today announced support for Container D

680
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,520
in the 1.14 release of the charmed Kubernetes

681
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,040
and their MicroK8s distributions,

682
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,360
which we talked about previously on Unplugged.

683
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:36,000
And Container D seems like it gets more and more momentum.

684
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,080
Wes, remind me again why Container D is the hotness.

685
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,040
I mean, really, it's just some simplification

686
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,560
to the whole craze that is the container runtime stack.

687
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,600
Before, you had stuff like, I mean, really, it all

688
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,260
started off with Docker, at least in the public's mind

689
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,240
recently, right?

690
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,160
And Docker did everything.

691
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,520
Container D spun off to have a nice, simple, separate daemon

692
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,480
that could just do all the container stuff, right?

693
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,680
Handle all the container lifecycle events

694
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,960
that you need, push and pull images.

695
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,280
Now, Docker, you can still use Docker if you know that

696
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:04,920
workflow.

697
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,920
But under the hood, it can just talk to Container D.

698
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,360
So it's just kind of simplification

699
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,320
and standardization within the industry, really.

700
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,160
Yeah, some much needed simplification, you might say.

701
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,320
That's good to know.

702
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,800
All right, well, then, before we move in to the meat

703
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:21,340
of the show, let's do a bit of housekeeping, a few items

704
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:21,880
to cover.

705
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,200
Next weekend is scale.

706
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:24,960
Come say hi to Wes.

707
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,760
Poppy and I, we're going to be at scale.

708
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,360
Very excited about that.

709
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,000
We have dinner planned.

710
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,040
You can get details for that at meetup.com

711
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:37,560
slash Jupiter Broadcasting, Saturday, March 9 at PF Chang's.

712
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,160
We'll be there stuffing our faces

713
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,880
and would love to hang out with you.

714
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,240
Looks like we have about 20 people signed up so far.

715
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,600
So if you're thinking about going,

716
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,880
go sign up so that way we can let PF Chang's know

717
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,920
what to expect.

718
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,720
Then when you're over at the meetup page,

719
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,680
check out the study groups we have coming up.

720
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,040
Today after the show, we're doing a study group

721
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,160
with Kenny on the fundamentals of Linux,

722
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,560
some really cool stuff on there.

723
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,640
We recently did a YAML study group.

724
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,840
We have virtual Linux Ansible fundamentals coming up,

725
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,480
as well as Kubernetes fundamentals

726
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,400
just around the corner.

727
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,560
We're doing a second study group in March.

728
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,240
All of those details up at meetup.com slash Jupiter

729
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,320
Broadcasting, including that second one

730
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,200
is going to be before the unplugged program.

731
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,960
So if the timing hasn't been working out for you,

732
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,960
this one might.

733
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:27,120
And then a plug for the seventh birthday of Linux Academy.

734
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,400
Congratulations.

735
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,360
That's huge.

736
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,400
It's a big day.

737
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,600
Does it feel like it's been 20 years,

738
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,880
or does it feel like it's been three?

739
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,000
Approximately 15 is what it feels like.

740
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,960
Not as bad.

741
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,040
So how do we go from, OK, I'm just curious, short version,

742
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,800
how do we go from, hey, it's our birthday,

743
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,440
to let's burn Chris's mouth off?

744
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,600
How did that, how to go from, hey, we've got a birthday,

745
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,320
to let's make Chris feel all the pain?

746
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,640
I'm happy to say that I had nothing to do with that.

747
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,520
Oh, really?

748
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,040
Outside of, of course, hosting it.

749
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:53,520
Yeah.

750
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,840
But that was not my idea.

751
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,480
Yeah, OK.

752
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,400
Well, there is a video coming up soon.

753
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,000
We did a chili challenge where Anthony asked us

754
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,480
trivia questions about the company.

755
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,520
And of course, because I'm the new guy,

756
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,840
there was small shot.

757
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,680
I had a small shot.

758
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,680
Well, you did know how many podcasts are offered.

759
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,600
Yeah, I got that one right.

760
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,120
Yeah, that was a good one.

761
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,920
And my mouth burned off.

762
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,500
And that video will be out soon.

763
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,120
Check out the Linux Academy com Twitter account

764
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,640
for when that gets posted.

765
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,960
And we have a whole bunch of live events coming up in April,

766
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,760
too.

767
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:26,240
So linuxacademy.com slash live, if you're

768
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,600
listening after the factor, you can remember that one.

769
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,600
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting, though.

770
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,880
That's where all the good stuff's going on for scale.

771
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,200
I'm very, very excited about that.

772
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,240
I think it's going to be a lot of fun.

773
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,680
Mostly just because Popeye's going to be there.

774
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,200
Since Popeye's going to be there, it's solid now.

775
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:40,880
Oh, yes.

776
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,000
I've just signed up for the meetup.

777
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,720
I didn't realize.

778
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,080
I thought I'd already done it, but I've actually

779
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,040
signed up for the Linux Fest Northwest one.

780
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,120
So I'm now going to two JBE meetups.

781
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,400
Great.

782
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,040
Super fan.

783
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,000
Yep, that's right.

784
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,480
The Linux Fest Northwest one is on there as well.

785
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,480
All right, so we also have another meetup

786
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,120
we should probably mention, speaking of Popeye.

787
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,280
Popeye and Wimpy are getting together

788
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,520
with their audience for the Ubuntu podcast

789
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,640
on March 16th, gettogether.com.

790
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,280
Or is it gettogether.community?

791
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,720
For that, I'll have a link in the show notes.

792
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,720
The Brew Dog, March 16th, 3 PM.

793
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,320
We've not had one of these before.

794
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,880
We did a tweet out at the end of last year

795
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,960
when we finished our last season and asked everyone, hey,

796
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,440
what kind of meetup would you like?

797
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,040
Would you like to have hacking session on laptops?

798
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,960
Would you like presentations?

799
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,280
Or should we go to a pub?

800
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,000
And overwhelmingly, everyone said, let's go to the pub.

801
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,440
So yes, we're doing that.

802
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,440
No way.

803
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,240
Surprise, surprise.

804
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,520
Yes, I know.

805
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,880
Yeah, who would have thought it?

806
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,080
English people voted to go to the pub.

807
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:43,960
Shocker.

808
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,920
My meetup advice is make sure the payment

809
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,400
stuff is clear up front.

810
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,480
Whatever it might be, make sure it is clear up front, right?

811
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,200
I'm editing it right now.

812
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,440
Don't tell anybody this.

813
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,840
Don't release this on the internet.

814
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,520
But I was somewhere once where I think

815
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,440
I watched Anthony get suckered into picking up

816
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,920
like a $2,100 meetup tab.

817
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,040
Yeah, Texas Linux Fest.

818
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,520
Yes.

819
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,320
And it was my bad because I brought the crowd.

820
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,760
It was, we're going to go out to lunch.

821
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,320
And it was like, oh, let's go out and do something.

822
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,700
And there was quite a crowd that followed us.

823
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,960
Plus, we had some of the staff, and it was just.

824
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,080
I just love doing that, though.

825
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,960
You know what I mean?

826
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,880
It's a give back to the community.

827
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,880
And plus, there's nothing better than hanging out

828
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,840
and just talking Linux and stuff with people.

829
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,720
All right, well, let's talk a little Linux.

830
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,080
Wes brought a soapbox into the studio about two weeks ago.

831
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,760
Just trying to keep it clean, you know.

832
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,320
Yeah, I mean, I'm usually the one that brings these.

833
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,600
Usually, it's about online journalism

834
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,060
and how it impacts open source communities.

835
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,360
That's usually my favorite one.

836
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,400
And it's even got a few trademarks on it now.

837
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,260
But Wes really brought this shiner in.

838
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,720
It's one that's been in my soapbox closet

839
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,400
for so long, and I'd never even thought

840
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,200
about talking on the show.

841
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,040
I thought maybe I was a crazy person.

842
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,800
But have you ever noticed how many damn hidden files

843
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,080
are in your home directory?

844
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,520
You do a good old-fashioned ls, it's not so bad.

845
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,760
Maybe you got a few inner case folders, things like that.

846
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:10,440
But you do an old ls-a, and all the hidden files are revealed.

847
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,800
It's a mess of it.

848
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,140
I encourage the listener, if you are in front of a computer

849
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:19,080
right now, do an old ls-a on your home directory.

850
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,080
It is extremely overrun with directories

851
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,800
that applications have crapped all over your home folder,

852
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,680
not following any particular standard,

853
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,680
making a mess out of things.

854
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,200
And I've just always thought it was just me

855
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,120
being a little precious, thinking

856
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,080
that it was my special computer, how dare they mess it up.

857
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,800
But I've seen a few articles.

858
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,920
And then when Wes walked in the door with this soapbox,

859
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,080
I knew I wasn't alone.

860
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,440
Let's see, I'm looking right now.

861
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,680
I have 42 directories, starting with a dot in front of them,

862
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,600
just littered around.

863
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,440
And then 27 files, totally separate from that.

864
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,360
You're an amateur.

865
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,720
Oh, really?

866
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,360
Oh, yeah, let's bring it, guys.

867
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,440
I've got 42 directories, like normal directories

868
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,760
in my home directory, and 117 hidden.

869
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,920
So yeah.

870
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,840
117?

871
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,080
What are you doing over there?

872
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,800
You're installing a bunch of software, aren't you?

873
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,560
This is the whole point.

874
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,160
They're hidden.

875
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,160
I don't care.

876
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,200
I don't see them.

877
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,920
Like, why should I care?

878
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,720
But they're there.

879
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,080
Because they're there.

880
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,400
That's like saying you shouldn't wash your hands.

881
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,360
So bed bugs, but I don't care.

882
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,000
They're hidden.

883
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,280
If I can't see them, they're not there.

884
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,780
That's good enough for me.

885
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:26,040
I'm surprised to hear this from a man of hygiene as yourself.

886
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,040
I agree.

887
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,360
Like, just get over yourself.

888
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:33,360
It's unfortunate that there are specifications

889
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,640
that you should be adhering to, to actually take care of where

890
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,960
these dot files get placed.

891
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,000
But the world isn't perfect.

892
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,440
And therefore, there is dot file proliferation.

893
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,680
But just, you can't, outside, out of mind, just get over it.

894
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,000
So you're saying there's no validity to the fact

895
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,840
that there is an XDG desktop standard that says clearly

896
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:57,120
that developers should put their configurations in the.config

897
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:00,240
folder and go to town in there to keep the user's home

898
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,000
directory clean.

899
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,500
Right.

900
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:05,240
And even the XDG specification doesn't say put it in.config.

901
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,920
It says use this environment variable declared

902
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,920
by your operating system that will put your.files

903
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,660
in the right place as prescribed by that OS.

904
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:17,080
So it's not even like randomly make it in.config.

905
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,280
Because on other platforms, that may not

906
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,080
be the right place to put it.

907
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,920
That aside, does it matter?

908
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,080
I think what it is is it's a result of the Unix and Linux

909
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,000
permissions model, where the developers have

910
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,360
no other guaranteed place to safely write something

911
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,240
that the user will have access to that won't

912
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,860
get destroyed on a reboot.

913
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:40,680
And so out of a lack of a better design,

914
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,760
they've had to just crap these files everywhere.

915
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,240
I think it's a bit of a shame.

916
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,920
I can think of two more reasons why.

917
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,000
Like one, that the application, let's look at Vim, for example,

918
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,440
predates the Free Desktop spec.

919
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:51,960
Sure.

920
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,160
So they can say, we're grandfathered in.

921
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,000
Screw you guys.

922
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,480
So Vim is in.vim in my home directory.

923
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,380
But what about developers who put stuff in the home directory

924
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:06,360
because that just looks like the right place to put it.

925
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,360
And they didn't know about the Free Desktop spec.

926
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:13,640
Maybe the Free Desktop spec isn't as well-publicized.

927
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:17,720
Maybe it's because we don't have rock-solid APIs like Apple

928
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,080
do, that people just go free-for-all, oh, that'll do,

929
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,880
and dump it in your home directory.

930
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,560
I'm looking at you, Thunderbird, that's in my home directory.

931
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,280
Yes, it's another one.

932
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,240
Yeah.

933
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:32,160
Thunderbird doesn't even ship a.desktop file, does it?

934
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,600
Or at least Firefox still doesn't.

935
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,100
Really?

936
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:35,600
Yeah, they do.

937
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,080
Yeah, they do.

938
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,240
Did they start adding one?

939
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,560
Because I remember it had to be patched in in the Ubuntu

940
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,320
Archive.

941
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,640
Yes, you're right.

942
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,480
Yeah, it was vendor-patched, wasn't it?

943
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,600
Wasn't this because of the branding debacle?

944
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,680
And now that's all gone away.

945
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,080
That does ring a bell.

946
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,040
That does ring a bell.

947
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,640
I'm pretty sure they don't carry a.desktop upstream.

948
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,480
Dan, you must agree with me.

949
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,560
This is a mess, right?

950
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,600
This is a mess.

951
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,480
This should be tidy.

952
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,840
There should be a platform solution to it.

953
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,240
And it should be all in one nice, clean spot

954
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,000
that is easy for the user to back up,

955
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,560
that doesn't make a mess of the root of the home directory.

956
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,480
Please tell me, Dan.

957
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,480
You're on my side.

958
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,480
Yeah, I kind of feel like the reason

959
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,860
that we need developers to care about this stuff

960
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,280
is so that we can provide platform features.

961
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,360
But if you're not actually providing those features,

962
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,720
there's no real incentive for them to follow the spec.

963
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,360
So I don't know.

964
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:29,340
Maybe containers will save us and will force developers

965
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,640
to do things more cleanly.

966
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,440
I have no idea.

967
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,940
No, the container file system will just be a horrible mess.

968
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:37,680
It'll just be inside the container.

969
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,400
Dang.

970
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,200
All right.

971
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,720
Wes, I tried.

972
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:45,160
I tried to represent the soapbox for you as best I could.

973
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,280
I'm sorry I failed you.

974
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,600
No, I mean, I think ultimately, it doesn't really matter.

975
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,560
It's just one of those small inconveniences.

976
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,160
And really, I only notice it when

977
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,760
I'm trying to teach new users.

978
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,300
And it's pretty far down on the list.

979
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,600
You know, I kind of just incidentally manage it.

980
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:01,080
And really, if you manage your backups or system at all,

981
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,000
you've found the few files that you might actually

982
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,480
need to care about already.

983
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,440
OK, now, I stood definitely on the I don't care bus

984
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,860
as I was traveling down the road.

985
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,720
But ding, ding, I want to get off.

986
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,600
I'm now looking at the things that are in my home directory.

987
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,360
And it is now starting to piss me off.

988
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:17,860
Amazing.

989
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,360
I love it.

990
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:18,860
I love it.

991
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,360
I love it.

992
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,360
I love it.

993
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,880
Whatever.

994
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:26,280
I can see a dot mumble overlay pipe, a dot mumble socket,

995
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,800
dot pulse dash cookie, dot selected underscore editor.

996
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,240
What the hell are these things doing in my home directory?

997
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,400
They're messing it up.

998
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,440
They're messing it up.

999
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,720
Disrespecting your home folder is the one spot

1000
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,960
on the system that's truly yours.

1001
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,800
And I go to great lengths to organize my home folder.

1002
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,520
It's just very disappointing.

1003
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,160
Are there any tools to clean this stuff up?

1004
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,480
I found a good one.

1005
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,840
Dot Lightworks, dot there can be only one.

1006
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,440
It's a zero byte file as well.

1007
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,280
Wimby, don't you have a dot file manager

1008
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,400
that backs these things up?

1009
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,180
And does it clean these things up too?

1010
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:04,240
Well, potentially it cleans them up

1011
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:10,120
if you reinstall your system and then you restore your dot file.

1012
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,240
So yes, I use a bit of software called Yadim,

1013
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,440
which is yet another dot files manager.

1014
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,760
You can find that at yadim.io.

1015
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,560
And it's basically a wrapper around git

1016
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,360
with a means of expressing these are the dot files or dot

1017
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:30,700
directories that I want to put under version control.

1018
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,800
And as you move between machines,

1019
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,160
you can check out and check in your configuration files

1020
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:41,240
so that your carefully curated configurations

1021
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,800
follow you everywhere.

1022
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,840
That makes it worse.

1023
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,560
Surely you're like spreading the virus far and wide

1024
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,840
to every machine.

1025
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,880
Well, these dot files are going to exist

1026
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,080
whether you like it or not.

1027
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:56,600
Dot git config, dot SSH, dot bash RC, the list goes on.

1028
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:01,840
So I may as well have my versions of those files.

1029
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,920
I don't get to choose where they get placed,

1030
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,880
but I can choose what gets placed inside them.

1031
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,040
So that's why I use a dot file manager.

1032
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,440
And I use it for more than just the dot files.

1033
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,640
Now I actually have, there are common directories

1034
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:20,080
you see in your home folder, downloads, music, videos.

1035
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,240
I have a couple of my own, my favorite

1036
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,760
being Cruft and another one called Development,

1037
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,160
for example.

1038
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,720
And those are in Yadim.

1039
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,720
So when I go to a new system I've just installed,

1040
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,240
I pull down my Yadim config, and it stands up

1041
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,280
all of my common directories.

1042
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,120
And even a folder called scripts,

1043
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,680
which is my tool belt of common stuff, is in there.

1044
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,160
So it makes the folders, too.

1045
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:42,680
Oh, yeah.

1046
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,880
Yeah, I've got a whole heap of stuff in there,

1047
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,320
all of my useful scripts.

1048
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,280
So I never have to worry, oh, where's

1049
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,520
that file that magically does this thing?

1050
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,680
Every computer, it's all the same.

1051
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,280
It's very fast.

1052
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:02,400
In fact, I had a disk fail earlier today about lunchtime.

1053
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,200
That is no biggie.

1054
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,280
I mean, I've got good backups.

1055
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,820
And because I've got these dot file things,

1056
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,880
I'm now up and running.

1057
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,800
So not going to name names, Popey, looking at you.

1058
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,000
But I was able to log into Mumble

1059
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,080
and move into the on-air channel because all

1060
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,280
of my Mumble certificates and everything

1061
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,740
are all in my dot file manager.

1062
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:21,600
And I was just back up and running within 20 minutes.

1063
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,440
Yet another dot file manager?

1064
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,600
Yeah, that one's pretty good.

1065
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,960
Follow Martin, too, except I did mine with Ansible scripts.

1066
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,960
And all of my configuration, software installations,

1067
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,360
and everything are done by a Git check-in.

1068
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,480
And then the script self-installs

1069
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,920
a cron job that uses Ansible pull

1070
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,440
to suck the configuration down to each machine that's

1071
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,280
configured.

1072
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,120
Very good.

1073
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,360
I don't think we're ever going to pick this stuff

1074
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:49,600
and make it sane until we have a free desktop cloud storage

1075
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,240
portal and a cloud settings portal

1076
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,200
so that users are complaining like, hey, GIMP

1077
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,120
didn't sync my settings to my next cloud.

1078
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,840
Use the things portal, and then it'll

1079
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,200
stop littering everywhere.

1080
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,560
That'd be a nice service that somebody could offer, really.

1081
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,360
That'd be good.

1082
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,600
That'd be really good.

1083
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:10,480
I like having a junk folder in my home directory.

1084
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,080
I like having a build folder in my home directory and a bin

1085
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,040
folder.

1086
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,720
So if I download something that is just

1087
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,520
like something to execute directly,

1088
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,060
I always move it to the bin folder.

1089
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,560
Or if it's something I have to build,

1090
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,320
I usually will do the git checkout in the build folder,

1091
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:27,080
build it there, and then move it to the bin directory.

1092
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,000
And then I'll create a.desktop file for it

1093
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,200
and actually integrate it into the Plasma launcher

1094
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,200
or something like that.

1095
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:35,720
I have a source folder that I use for downloading stuff

1096
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,720
that I'm compiling from source.

1097
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,840
And then development is my own projects

1098
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,780
that I have tucked away.

1099
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:42,280
Nice.

1100
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,240
It's a good setup.

1101
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,520
And that's why I care.

1102
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,120
I know I shouldn't care, but that's why I care so much.

1103
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,680
People have been tweeting me and telegramming me

1104
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,680
their pictures all week.

1105
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,840
It's been really funny to see the different junk

1106
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,760
in people's folders.

1107
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,440
And you get an idea of what kind of programs they run.

1108
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,840
I kind of enjoy looking at it.

1109
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,880
You can see those directories, though.

1110
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,640
You know, downloads, music, in your case, junk, in my case,

1111
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,440
cruft.

1112
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,120
But you can't see the.files.

1113
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,680
Unless you want to turn it on your file manager,

1114
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,920
and why would you do that yourself,

1115
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,520
see.files every time you open the file manager?

1116
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,160
You know, you don't see them.

1117
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,160
What's the big deal?

1118
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,760
Yeah, it's not really so much.

1119
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,960
It's just sort of the principle of it.

1120
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,520
And every now and then, it strikes me.

1121
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:25,120
And I had an opportunity to really think about it

1122
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,680
when Wes brought that soapbox into the studio.

1123
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,720
And I was just sitting there looking at that shiny box.

1124
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,620
And I thought, you know, you're right.

1125
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,560
That's my home folder, Wes.

1126
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,220
He likes to get me fired up like that.

1127
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:36,000
Wes will go in there and switch out an editor to Vim,

1128
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,440
maybe alias nano to Vim.

1129
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,160
You're just so fun to troll.

1130
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,520
It's not my fault.

1131
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,960
I think this is a slippery slope.

1132
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,080
And next, you'll be one of these nutters

1133
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:47,720
that is refusing to run a Linux desktop environment

1134
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,160
if there's any D-Bus in it.

1135
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,080
And you'll be compiling out D-Bus from every application

1136
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:52,960
imaginable.

1137
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,240
I happened across one such blog this week.

1138
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,820
And I was just looking at it thinking,

1139
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:58,320
why would you do this to yourself?

1140
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:01,900
Why would you go to these links to remove a useful technology

1141
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,800
from the Linux desktop?

1142
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,280
Were they on dev1 by chance?

1143
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,040
No, no, they were not.

1144
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,680
But you know, I was just reading it,

1145
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,400
thinking, Carlos, there's a lot of effort to go to.

1146
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,320
And I'd love to know the rationale as to why

1147
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,520
you would want to do that.

1148
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,040
Yeah.

1149
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,600
Yeah, some people like the challenge.

1150
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,880
Is there a desktop environment that doesn't use D-Bus at all?

1151
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,040
I don't think there is.

1152
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,520
I mean, doesn't XFCE, they use XConf.

1153
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,280
But I don't know if that's using D-Bus behind the scenes

1154
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:32,880
or not, or if it's their own X settings sort of overlay.

1155
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,100
What kind of system can you run without D-Bus?

1156
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,680
Well, I know, right?

1157
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,000
This is why sitting there and compiling,

1158
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,400
removing it from build options and what have you,

1159
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,360
it's just crazy to me.

1160
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:47,920
It's, you know, modern technology requires a means

1161
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,920
for inter-process communication.

1162
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,920
Yeah, we could have actually used a lot more of that.

1163
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,520
I find it curious that throughout this whole blog post,

1164
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,840
they didn't actually give the rationale for everything

1165
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,320
you were reading.

1166
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,680
No, that's just an assumed.

1167
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,480
Yeah, no, it was just describing the length

1168
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,800
they'd gone to to remove it.

1169
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,000
It was astonishing.

1170
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,600
Did it work at all afterwards?

1171
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,240
I mean, were they happy with the results?

1172
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,320
Well, they had to make a number of compromises

1173
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,400
in the applications that they were prepared to use.

1174
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,480
Because as Dan points out, there's

1175
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:19,040
a whole catalog of software that is a hard requirement now.

1176
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,000
Right, including like Network Manager and?

1177
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,720
Even like system level stuff like DNS Mask

1178
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,840
wants to use D-Bus by default now.

1179
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,520
You know, as our buddy Richard says,

1180
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,040
I think it's wasted effort.

1181
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,360
I think that is some wasted effort there, my friends.

1182
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,200
All right, well, I'm glad Anthony's here for this story.

1183
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,280
This is our last story of the day before we get to the picks.

1184
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:41,280
And I'd love to get your perspective on this one.

1185
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,560
So Lyft is doing an IPO.

1186
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,960
And as part of that, it has come out

1187
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:51,080
that they are paying Amazon at a minimum of $8 million

1188
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:54,680
a month until the end of 2021.

1189
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,360
It's all buried in there.

1190
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:59,640
They're contractually obligated to pay at least $300 million

1191
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,640
to Amazon Web Services.

1192
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,960
They're committed to spending between $8.33 million

1193
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,520
and $8.57 million a month to AWS.

1194
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,120
Really what struck me is that, I mean,

1195
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,400
they're committed to this, right?

1196
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,080
If they don't hit or exceed that $300 million threshold,

1197
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,640
well, they're going to have to pay the difference.

1198
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,160
Yeah.

1199
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,080
Is it based on a commitment?

1200
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,840
Or is it based on something like reserved instances

1201
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,200
or something silly like that?

1202
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,680
Yeah, it's like a price deal they got.

1203
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,000
Yeah, so what's happening, and we

1204
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,040
got to experience this with one of them as well.

1205
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:31,080
So what they're doing is they're locking in these contracts.

1206
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,000
And they're contractually obligated

1207
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,680
to hit a certain amount of revenue

1208
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:35,760
as part of the contract.

1209
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,280
Now, there's things that they do in return.

1210
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,560
Sometimes they're partnerships.

1211
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:42,120
Sometimes it's just access to stuff.

1212
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,400
Or they'll come in and help you with their infrastructure.

1213
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,980
It just depends on what you negotiate

1214
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:46,980
with the cloud provider.

1215
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:49,120
But it's contractually obligated to hit it.

1216
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,200
This is really remarkable, because the information

1217
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,080
recently reported that several companies have

1218
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:56,600
found that their AWS bills are getting surprisingly high.

1219
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,000
Dropbox notably recently switched off

1220
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,240
AWS to their own on-premises infrastructure

1221
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,640
due to monthly run costs.

1222
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,680
There was another startup that announced

1223
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,480
that they were also contractually

1224
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,640
obligated to make a certain payment level,

1225
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,080
like they would have a certain level of usage.

1226
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:15,160
And it strikes me, well, I guess the first thing that

1227
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,000
strikes me about this is what an intense amount of money

1228
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,200
to use what is essentially hosted free software

1229
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,000
at the core of it.

1230
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,080
Like, what a striking amount of money.

1231
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,760
That is really, really something.

1232
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,640
Per month, $300 million is what they

1233
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,800
have to pay total, which works out to be almost $9 million

1234
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,080
a month.

1235
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,520
It's good to be AWS, huh?

1236
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,600
I mean, there's companies that don't even

1237
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,520
get close to making that much money in an entire year.

1238
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,160
Yeah, but it's not unfeasible, though.

1239
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,040
Think of Lyft, at least Uber is.

1240
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,960
But Lyft's a global company.

1241
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,160
They've got to run at scale.

1242
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,000
They've got to run it high available.

1243
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,160
You don't want your Lyft application going down.

1244
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,560
Right, especially when you're driving somebody.

1245
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:52,200
Yeah, just to manage all the servers and application

1246
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,640
and development on that, the salary alone

1247
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,480
to run all that in-house and all the infrastructure

1248
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,080
and everything starts getting up there

1249
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,520
to be expensive versus AWS, where you

1250
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,000
can offload a lot of that.

1251
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,700
You still have a lot of control, but you

1252
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:06,160
don't have to own the hardware, worry

1253
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,320
about the scaling, and you can do it quicker.

1254
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,840
So sometimes for that convenience

1255
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,880
and that kind of safety net, it's what you're paying for.

1256
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,600
It's almost a little security versus.

1257
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,400
Right, and it's the core of their business.

1258
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,660
It's like what they do is that they're a service.

1259
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:20,040
They have to be online.

1260
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:20,800
Oh, yeah.

1261
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,400
Well, and they've got to be able to scale, too.

1262
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,360
And I mean, you've got to be able to scale up and scale down.

1263
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,040
And I mean, I guess at the end of the day,

1264
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,280
that's one of my favorite questions.

1265
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,920
Are they a hardware company?

1266
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:30,920
Are they an engineering?

1267
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,000
What do they specialize in?

1268
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,880
And then offload the stuff that you

1269
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,800
don't specialize in to somebody who does.

1270
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,680
Even if it costs a little bit of a premium,

1271
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,720
you need to stay focused on your core business.

1272
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,640
So it sounds like they're doing that.

1273
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,600
But I'll tell you what, I feel a lot better about our cloud

1274
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,560
bills now.

1275
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,840
That is good news.

1276
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,200
Yeah, well, that gives you an idea

1277
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,200
of where they could go, though.

1278
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,880
Here's another way to look at it,

1279
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:54,140
even when you're not the size of a Lyft.

1280
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,600
So I'm going to speak from experience

1281
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,040
here at my last company.

1282
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,280
When I started, we had 11 IT people.

1283
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,560
We could barely keep up with the engineers.

1284
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,320
We shifted everything into Amazon.

1285
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,640
Our staffing cut down to four people.

1286
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:11,360
We still kept up, and we were saving about $700,000 a year

1287
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:15,600
based on salaries, benefits, and everything like that.

1288
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:16,360
Sure.

1289
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,480
Well, if it wasn't for the cloud,

1290
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:18,640
we wouldn't be here today.

1291
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,240
We couldn't offer.

1292
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:23,720
I mean, when Linux Academy started, I had nothing.

1293
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,520
Like, I had dollars to my name.

1294
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,960
Wouldn't be able to do anything if it wasn't for the ability

1295
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,680
that you pay for what you use.

1296
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,960
I mean, if you would have had to pre-provision co-location

1297
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:35,120
space, or hardware, dedicated hosting, or something like

1298
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,560
that, it's just too expensive.

1299
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,080
Were the first systems on a dedicated box?

1300
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,080
No.

1301
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,720
It was all AWS when we first started.

1302
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,160
Now we're across the different stuff.

1303
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,640
It was all AWS.

1304
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,240
If your bills are getting expensive,

1305
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,360
it's because you're not managing your costs,

1306
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,400
because there's always going to be that discussion

1307
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,840
and evaluation of what your business requirements are.

1308
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:58,280
And if you have to accomplish x, you're going to have a cost.

1309
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,140
And if you're outside of your budget,

1310
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:01,480
it's because you're not watching it,

1311
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,960
or there's been a variable change in your business.

1312
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,680
And it's an evaluation.

1313
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,780
It's constantly changing.

1314
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:08,640
You constantly have to evaluate it.

1315
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,760
And if you need to stick to that hardcore budget,

1316
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,840
well, then you need to make some decisions on what

1317
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,160
you're going to cut to stay there.

1318
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,280
Yeah, yeah, I agree.

1319
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:19,600
And in a past role, we actually took a decision

1320
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:23,520
that it was cheaper to re-architect the application

1321
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:29,960
that we were deploying to use microservices and stay on AWS

1322
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,520
and manage our AWS instances better than it

1323
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:37,280
was to bring everything in-house, so to speak,

1324
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,240
and stick it on our own metal and continue

1325
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,840
operating our application in the way it was currently

1326
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:43,560
architected.

1327
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,480
So you do have to think creatively

1328
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,240
when you use Amazon and, or AWS, rather.

1329
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,160
And it's not a replacement for, I

1330
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:55,260
have a big server in the corner, and now I

1331
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,880
want a big server in the cloud.

1332
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,040
That is not what these cloud providers are

1333
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,080
designed to offer at all.

1334
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,880
That's a whole different scenario.

1335
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,160
I even had a VDI deployment where our hardware aged out.

1336
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,920
And the cost of replacing that hardware alone,

1337
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:15,040
we would have paid it off using the cloud in about four

1338
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,120
and a half years.

1339
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,040
By that time, you're almost ready for a hardware refresh

1340
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:18,640
again.

1341
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,040
It was a break even, but then you

1342
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,800
get all the management capabilities

1343
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:24,200
that you're not even breaking a sweat.

1344
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,640
Right, yeah.

1345
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:26,640
I remember this story.

1346
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,920
A few years ago, it came out, and I just looked it up again,

1347
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:32,760
and it turns out it's now a case study on AWS website,

1348
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,600
but it's from Zynga, or Zynga, or however they pronounce it,

1349
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,200
Z-Y-N-G-A, the gaming company.

1350
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:37,840
Zynga, I think?

1351
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,800
Zynga, yeah.

1352
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,920
And so what they did was when they,

1353
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:44,160
FarmVille or whatever on Facebook was huge,

1354
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,340
and they ended up thinking, hey, it's

1355
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:49,640
going to be cheaper for us to just host our own data center.

1356
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,720
And so they started on AWS, and they moved it

1357
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,160
onto their own data center.

1358
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,280
And there was a whole bunch of stuff that happened.

1359
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,320
The technology change that they had to do,

1360
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,080
the popularity of their games went down,

1361
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,880
and they had this complete overall cost commitment.

1362
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,920
Now, this kind of goes back to the article, though.

1363
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,800
If they would have had a contract like this,

1364
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,840
would they still have the cost commitment?

1365
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:11,520
Does Lyft have that cost commitment,

1366
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,800
or is there something in the contract that says,

1367
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,920
hey, maybe if the business starts going south?

1368
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,720
Because if you start removing the benefits of scaling up

1369
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,220
and down and paying for what you need

1370
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:23,500
and being tied into obligations, that's

1371
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:26,120
when it's potential that you start losing some

1372
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,620
of the advantages of the cloud.

1373
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:32,640
I think what's, to me, very clear

1374
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,120
is for a very, very long time now,

1375
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:38,080
and this really bears it out, the actual cost

1376
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,680
of the core software itself is a very minor factor

1377
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,320
in enterprise deployments.

1378
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,760
And so the way we're seeing that bear out here

1379
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:50,600
is the fact that AWS is often implementing

1380
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,120
open source software and then providing that as a service,

1381
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:56,760
the fact that the very similar functionality

1382
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,060
is available for completely free,

1383
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:03,960
and that's not acting as sort of a backstop to these costs.

1384
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:06,000
The costs seem to be independent of the fact

1385
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,500
that they're all based on software that's absolutely free.

1386
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,800
Like, that does not seem to be impacting the cost of AWS

1387
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,320
at all.

1388
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,700
All AWS is doing in these cloud providers

1389
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:15,360
is they're taking something that exists

1390
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,120
and they're putting their wrappers around it.

1391
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:19,320
Postgres, MariaDB.

1392
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,120
They're just wrapping RDS around it

1393
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,440
and writing some code to manage it on their end.

1394
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,480
I think it really underscores the cost of software

1395
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:28,040
isn't a huge deciding factor for businesses,

1396
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:30,280
because otherwise they'd be using the free stuff.

1397
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,640
It's everything else.

1398
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,320
It's the staffing, it's the implementation,

1399
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,480
it's the maintenance, it's the future proofing,

1400
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,320
it's the scaling.

1401
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,120
It's so many other things that go into it.

1402
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:38,400
Right.

1403
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,640
Cost might be a factor, right?

1404
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,280
It's one of those, but you can't ignore that.

1405
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,240
So you might not go with the premium Oracle database

1406
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,200
because Postgres is free.

1407
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,500
But yes, you still have to pay to keep the thing online

1408
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:47,800
and do your backups.

1409
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,720
One of the big sort of commercial avenues for Ubuntu

1410
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:55,200
is Bootstack, which is where we manage and operate

1411
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,640
clouds on behalf of organizations.

1412
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:00,120
So it's all the same open source stuff

1413
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,400
that everyone's familiar with.

1414
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,080
But they want professionals to just look after that.

1415
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:11,040
As Anthony said earlier, if IT is not your core business

1416
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,160
mission, then why would you do that?

1417
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,360
Pay somebody else to look after that bit for you

1418
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,160
so you can get on with the business

1419
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:21,160
of actually running your operation.

1420
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,720
Yeah, you've got to focus, right?

1421
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:26,320
You've got to choose only a few things

1422
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,520
to focus on as a company.

1423
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,480
Because if you've got to focus on and be experts

1424
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:32,720
in a lot of different things, that's a staffing nightmare.

1425
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,180
That's an expertise nightmare.

1426
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:36,080
That's an institutional knowledge nightmare.

1427
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,000
It's a risk.

1428
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Yeah.

1429
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,540
Yeah, it's something to see it, though,

1430
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:40,880
just to see it in hard numbers.

1431
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,800
You get glimpses because this stuff is usually all private,

1432
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,680
like how much people are paying and stuff.

1433
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,640
But when you file an IPO, these things come out.

1434
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,280
And so now we're seeing it.

1435
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,320
Now, when Uber goes for their IPO, we'll get an idea

1436
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,720
of what they're spending on this infrastructure cost, too,

1437
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,640
I would imagine.

1438
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,440
$300 million by 2022, though.

1439
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,200
That's significant.

1440
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,660
Really curious what that lock-in details.

1441
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:03,240
The Business Insider article says

1442
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,920
that Lyft still has to pay it, even if they

1443
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,400
don't reach that usage level.

1444
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,560
But you never know.

1445
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,080
There could be something else in the contract that says,

1446
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,880
hey, if we go completely bottoms up, this is over.

1447
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:13,880
Who knows, right?

1448
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,260
And what do they get in exchange?

1449
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:17,260
Because when you look at the traditional model,

1450
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:20,520
simply the only way they lock you in on anything,

1451
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:23,200
as far as a duration, is reserved instances.

1452
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,800
That's your largest cost savings.

1453
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,320
That's your contractual obligation.

1454
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:29,560
Outside of that, it's consume what you use and pay for that.

1455
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,480
So speaking from experience, what I can say

1456
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:33,320
is they try to entice you with some stuff,

1457
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:37,320
like you can have access to some of our in-house developers

1458
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,600
to help you solve some of your big technical challenges.

1459
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,880
And you get priority attention.

1460
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,760
And you get access into product managers.

1461
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,360
And they help.

1462
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,360
Those are the type of deals that actually

1463
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:52,400
help influence the feature roadmap inside of services.

1464
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,600
Yeah, where you're a big enough customer that can come in

1465
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,400
and say, hey, you've showed up on our radar.

1466
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,240
Let's talk.

1467
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,700
Or if the customer goes and says, hey, we have this problem.

1468
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:00,280
We need this.

1469
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:03,000
They will prioritize it in terms of development for them

1470
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:03,720
internally.

1471
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,440
It's not even size-driven, though.

1472
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,480
So I work for an MSP.

1473
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:10,640
We resell a managed Amazon service.

1474
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,000
So we manage Amazon for customers,

1475
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,760
because they don't even want to do that.

1476
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,640
Amazon, for the smallest deals, throws us

1477
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:21,400
a huge amount of credits to hand off to the customer.

1478
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,360
Like, I have a new customer that's three servers.

1479
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:28,000
They just issued me a $5,000 credit US for no reason

1480
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,560
other than to entice them to come in,

1481
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:32,840
because they know full well that once you're in there,

1482
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:33,720
you're going to spend.

1483
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,180
And that's just all there is to it.

1484
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:39,760
So they will go over backwards with architecture help.

1485
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,800
You get access to product managers.

1486
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,680
You can walk into their office and sit down

1487
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:44,640
and meet with them.

1488
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,200
They just want to get you hooked in,

1489
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,000
because they know you will spend.

1490
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:49,640
Simple.

1491
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,880
It's almost like the entire Amazon business model.

1492
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,040
Go in for market share.

1493
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,040
Get them on there first.

1494
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:55,140
Worry about profits later.

1495
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:58,680
But AWS is exceptionally profitable, actually.

1496
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,960
Well, market leader, they're just there first, right?

1497
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,200
It's like anyone who gets there first, you have an advantage.

1498
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:07,680
Yeah, and it's everybody else's game now to catch up.

1499
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:11,880
Well, so I think, still, there's something about it, though,

1500
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:14,440
that strikes me, just to conclude our thoughts.

1501
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:15,840
Just something about it strikes me

1502
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:19,200
that you could build something similar with free software

1503
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:19,720
yourself.

1504
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:22,080
Like, it's a very interesting time

1505
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:24,360
where something very similar is achievable on your own

1506
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:27,000
if you have the right time, the resources, and the reasons.

1507
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,760
Or you can go flip a switch and have it

1508
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:32,120
on this almost what seems like infinite scale.

1509
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:34,960
But it's the same essential free software underneath it all.

1510
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,000
Don't reinvent the wheel.

1511
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,040
Spend time inventing something new.

1512
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:38,800
Yeah.

1513
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:39,320
Yeah.

1514
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:42,240
And there's occasions when, depending

1515
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:46,120
on what you're working on, the focus of the business,

1516
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,200
you can't use the public cloud.

1517
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:51,320
You know, you may be the custodians of data

1518
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:55,120
that you simply don't have the agreement to put somewhere

1519
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,000
in a public instance.

1520
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
And one of the companies I worked for in the past,

1521
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,520
we created our own data center, effectively our own cloud.

1522
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:06,240
And we operated it because the customers that we were servicing,

1523
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,440
they all had sensitive data.

1524
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,460
And there was no way we would be successful as a business

1525
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:13,620
if we were using public cloud infrastructure.

1526
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:15,080
So we had to build our own.

1527
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:15,560
Right.

1528
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,080
There's stuff like VoIP comes to mind

1529
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,880
are the things we have latency guarantees

1530
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:19,680
that you have to make.

1531
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:20,520
Yeah.

1532
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:22,640
I'm not going to mention the nature of the business.

1533
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,280
But yeah, there's a lot of different strata

1534
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,720
of organizations where you simply cannot put it

1535
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:28,680
in the public cloud.

1536
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:29,600
The other thing that strikes me is

1537
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:32,320
it's harder sometimes to build those private clouds these days

1538
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:35,960
because people are using so much cloud infrastructure.

1539
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:37,720
Unless you're giant and can pay top dollar,

1540
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:39,460
those people go to build the public clouds,

1541
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:41,080
and they're not going to build yours.

1542
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:43,760
But even look at what Amazon's doing without posts,

1543
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:44,920
if you're familiar with it.

1544
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:47,560
It's basically Amazon in a box in your data center

1545
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:50,560
that they fully manage from the same console using

1546
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,720
the same APIs.

1547
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,800
When the cloud first came out, I was sitting here thinking,

1548
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,960
I don't know why it popped in my head.

1549
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,720
But I'm sure it's popped in everybody's head.

1550
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:02,480
They're just going to get rid of everybody's job.

1551
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,320
And then if they just spin stuff up,

1552
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,740
you don't have to worry about stuff.

1553
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:08,320
And then every year that goes by, every year that goes by,

1554
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:12,280
I would actually argue to say that architectures these days

1555
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:15,080
are more complicated than they were 10 years because

1556
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:15,640
of the cloud.

1557
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:18,680
You have 100 and some different AWS services,

1558
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,160
an infinite number of combination of things,

1559
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:23,720
awesome architectures like event-driven architectures

1560
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:25,800
that you're empowered to do.

1561
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:30,760
And now you can specialize in a specific component

1562
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:34,360
of expertise and just that in the cloud.

1563
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,360
Yeah, you're right.

1564
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:39,440
It's a continuing expansion.

1565
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,960
We were talking on Linux Action News this week

1566
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,960
about these little microcontroller devices

1567
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:46,840
for valves and whatnot that are now getting connected to AWS

1568
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:50,040
and getting managed by AWS.

1569
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:52,440
It's really everything.

1570
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:53,400
Not for everybody.

1571
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:56,480
We wouldn't be just very much pointed out very clearly.

1572
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:59,200
There are still plenty of use cases.

1573
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,160
Yeah, and you're right.

1574
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:02,280
It's getting even more complex now.

1575
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:05,000
And it gets even crazier when you start going multi-cloud

1576
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,280
or you have some on-premises, some on-cloud.

1577
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,320
It can be really complicated now.

1578
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:10,820
Well, Chris, if you were ever going

1579
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:14,640
to start a high-speed frequency trading software company,

1580
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:17,560
you would for sure have to have your own on-premises

1581
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:18,080
environment.

1582
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:18,920
I do know that.

1583
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:19,640
Oh, yeah?

1584
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:20,360
Yeah.

1585
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:21,840
The speed matters.

1586
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,320
That makes sense.

1587
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:24,600
Or what about Bitcoin?

1588
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,000
No, probably not Bitcoin.

1589
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,160
No, not Bitcoin.

1590
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,080
You can spin up all the GPUs.

1591
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:30,880
Well, before we get out of here, why don't we

1592
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,000
do a couple of app picks?

1593
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,680
I promised you at the top of the show that we would give you

1594
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:40,440
not one, but two different potential video editors

1595
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,120
for the Linux desktop this week.

1596
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:46,640
Both have brand new versions that came out just this week.

1597
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:50,720
First off, the one, the only Flowblade,

1598
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:53,000
describes itself as fast, precise, and stable.

1599
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,040
It's a GPL3-licensed video editor

1600
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,400
based on the MLT framework, which

1601
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,160
just got a brand new update.

1602
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,480
And one of the big things in here

1603
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:02,960
is composite, mix, filter, and animate.

1604
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,360
My review of this is it's still in early days,

1605
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,280
but it's getting better.

1606
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,800
When I mentioned that in the pre-show,

1607
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,920
Mr. Wimpris jumped in with Shotcut.

1608
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:16,640
Yeah, I'm deeply, deeply in love with Shotcut.

1609
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:21,040
I'm by no means a well-versed video editor,

1610
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:24,800
but I did some research in the middle of last year

1611
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:28,720
to choose a video editor that I was going to learn and use

1612
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,600
for projects in the future.

1613
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:35,120
And Shotcut came out as my preferred choice.

1614
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:37,640
And the guys behind Shotcut, and this is Dan Denady,

1615
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:42,440
he's got a long history in the video post-processing

1616
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:45,840
and video editing industry, and is also

1617
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:48,000
the guy behind MLT itself.

1618
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,300
So Shotcut is kind of like the reference implementation

1619
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:56,120
of what Melt can do on the back end.

1620
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:58,080
And there's lots of killer features,

1621
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:00,400
but the things that have really started to stand out

1622
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,960
in recent months in Shotcut is the key frame support.

1623
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,880
You can now have multi-point key frames,

1624
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,560
so you can move effects and transitions

1625
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:11,880
through multiple curves.

1626
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:14,040
Color grading is excellent.

1627
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:18,520
And the thing that I really love is first class

1628
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:23,240
encode your video, render your video out on the GPU, which

1629
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:26,240
for listeners at home, you only want to do on NVIDIA GPUs

1630
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:31,320
because the quality on AMD is particularly bad.

1631
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:34,160
It's quite bad on Intel.

1632
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:37,720
On 10-series NVIDIA cards, it's acceptable.

1633
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:41,160
And on 20-series NVIDIA cards, it's excellent.

1634
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,480
Ah, good to know.

1635
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:46,320
Yeah, and conveniently, snap, install Shotcut.

1636
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:48,880
You'll always have the latest version.

1637
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,400
Oh, I love it.

1638
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,360
Also, the new version not only updates

1639
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:58,840
to a new version of Qt, but it's got some feature in here,

1640
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:03,200
a new feature, added English Great Britain translation.

1641
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,480
I don't know what that would be.

1642
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,360
I don't know what that would be.

1643
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:05,840
Oh, yeah.

1644
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:06,600
That's strange.

1645
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:11,360
Yeah, it's excellent now that we have the text appearing

1646
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:13,840
in the application in traditional English

1647
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:15,680
rather than simplified English.

1648
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,400
Well, thank you for the pick.

1649
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,800
Shotcut and Flow Blade, we'll have links in the show notes.

1650
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:23,880
LinuxUnplugged.com slash episode number, which insert

1651
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:25,840
episode number here, which is 291.

1652
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:29,200
Or the links will be in your mobile podcast player.

1653
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,560
Guys, good luck.

1654
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:33,680
I think we have one more week or two before the meetup.

1655
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,200
But good luck with your Ubuntu meetup.

1656
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:38,040
And Popey, looking forward to seeing you at scale, sir.

1657
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:38,640
Oh, yes.

1658
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:39,800
I cannot wait.

1659
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,400
Yeah, it's going to be good times.

1660
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:44,520
All right, with that, we will begin to wrap it up.

1661
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:47,200
Go follow Anthony on Twitter, AnthonyDJames.

1662
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,440
I'm at ChrisLAS.

1663
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:50,400
Go follow Wes at WesPayne.

1664
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:53,960
Go check out Wes on the TechSnap program, TechSnap.Systems.

1665
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:56,480
I was hanging out with Jim Salter this week talking

1666
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,640
about proper passwords, right?

1667
01:03:58,640 --> 01:03:59,480
Is that what it was?

1668
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:00,240
Oh, yeah.

1669
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:04,280
How to do proper password storage, not plain text.

1670
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:06,520
Never, never plain text.

1671
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:08,760
No, it was a really good episode.

1672
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:11,400
It was a good take on a topic that we've heard before.

1673
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:12,480
I really liked it.

1674
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,040
A lot of good information in there.

1675
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:15,560
Hey, coming up in just a little bit,

1676
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:18,200
if you're listening live, is the study group.

1677
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,680
But if you missed it, there may be a YouTube channel

1678
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:22,360
in the meantime.

1679
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:24,280
Come back here next Tuesday.

1680
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:48,600
I'll see you guys next time.

1681
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:59,480
All right, let's do a little post-show and get out of here.

1682
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:00,360
Do our titles.

1683
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:02,000
We didn't have the votes going this week,

1684
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,200
so we've got to figure out what the heck we're

1685
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,240
going to title this thing.

1686
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,960
Brent's doing some great work, working

1687
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:07,960
the doc with some titles.

1688
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:09,280
Maybe you should read those out here.

1689
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,040
Propose them, Brent.

1690
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:10,680
Oh, really?

1691
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:11,680
Good job, Brent.

1692
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:13,240
See, you're going to win this one.

1693
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:16,040
Well, I'm not up against very many people here,

1694
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:18,600
so some of the best, I must say.

1695
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:19,160
That's true.

1696
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:19,800
That's true.

1697
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:20,840
What do you like the best, though?

1698
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:23,480
Is there one of them you like?

1699
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:25,400
Lifting the clouds.

1700
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:29,920
Lifting the clouds, flipping the switch on FOSS, dot or dash.

1701
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,880
I like that one.

1702
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:33,640
And clouding out open source.

1703
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:34,880
Clouding out?

1704
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,760
Clouding out, like crowding out?

1705
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:38,360
Like that kind of thing?

1706
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:38,920
Like crowding?

1707
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:40,600
Let it be what you want.

1708
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:42,920
$8 million a month in AWS.

1709
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:44,640
What?

1710
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:45,680
Really?

1711
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:46,560
Oh, oh, oh.

1712
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:48,560
I thought you meant that was, I was like, no way.

1713
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:49,440
I thought you said that.

1714
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:50,600
You think that was our bill?

1715
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:52,400
Yes.

1716
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,800
No way, I was going to say.

1717
01:05:56,240 --> 01:06:00,240
Isn't that what it was from Lyft, in the $8 million?

1718
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:03,280
Yeah, it was $8 million, $8.9 million a month, I think.

1719
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:06,120
All right, so dot or dash, clouding out open source,

1720
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:10,120
lifting the clouds, flipping the switch on FOSS?

1721
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:12,040
What about flipping the switch?

1722
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:13,120
What was that about?

1723
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:14,360
That was about ease of use.

1724
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:16,600
You mentioned it for, you can just

1725
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,800
turn the switch on a server now and concentrate

1726
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,100
on something more interesting.

1727
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:24,200
But if you had to ask, maybe it means it's not right.

1728
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:25,200
Hmm.

1729
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:25,800
All right.

1730
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:26,920
Well, that's horrible then.

1731
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:27,880
That's horrible.

1732
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:30,040
What are you guys doing for the rest of the evening?

1733
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:32,200
Assuming you're not listening to the study group.

1734
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,880
Nobody's going to tell me what they're doing tonight?

1735
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:36,120
Yeah, my wife just came in to give me

1736
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:37,920
my daughter's passport.

1737
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:38,800
Yeah, sorry.

1738
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,520
Good, keep that handy.

1739
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:42,920
I also, I'm building up a packing list for scale.

1740
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,720
Making sure I'm bringing along everything

1741
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:47,000
I need to bring along, because otherwise I'll forget.

1742
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:47,800
I'm terrible.

1743
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:48,840
My memory's awful.

1744
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:51,040
What's the most important thing on there?

1745
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:51,800
I can't tell you.

1746
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:52,600
It's a surprise.

1747
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:53,600
Oh.

1748
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:54,680
Oh.

1749
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:55,560
Oh.

1750
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:57,480
I bet it's for the bad vultures thing.

1751
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,520
Yeah, loads of stuff.

1752
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:00,760
They're just like, just in case.

1753
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,720
Because you know when you want to stand at an event,

1754
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:05,480
you've got to have everything just in case.

1755
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:10,320
All the extra bits involved, USB keys, and a Raspberry Pi,

1756
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:15,880
SD cards, and HDMI cables, and USB chargers, and all that crap.

1757
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:18,160
Always feel better with a pie in your pocket.

1758
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:20,920
Yes.

1759
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:24,240
Hadid got pulled over by TSA for traveling with my microphone.

1760
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:24,960
Really?

1761
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,240
This happens a few times, yeah.

1762
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,800
I meant to take the bag with me, but just the way it worked out.

1763
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,120
I guess it looks like a pipe bomb.

1764
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:31,720
Oh, I've had that.

1765
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:33,320
When I was flying to the States once,

1766
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:38,520
they said the check at the gate, just before I got on the plane,

1767
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:39,880
he emptied out my laptop bag.

1768
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:42,560
And I had my Zoom microphone in there.

1769
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:43,520
And he said, what's this?

1770
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:44,920
I said, it's a microphone.

1771
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:46,560
He said, what's that for?

1772
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:47,800
And I said, interviewing people.

1773
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,120
And he goes, are you a journalist?

1774
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:49,920
I was like, no.

1775
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:51,840
He goes, oh, because if you were a journalist,

1776
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:54,920
you wouldn't be allowed into the States on the visa you've got.

1777
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:56,480
I was like, uh, what?

1778
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:57,400
No, I'm not.

1779
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,640
So I was like, oh, shit.

1780
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:00,680
That's crazy.

1781
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:03,760
I always get stopped, both for the microphone and then

1782
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:08,200
a bag full of just photo gear that seems like no one would ever

1783
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:11,520
carry that much, and then a glass jar full of oatmeal.

1784
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,600
They always give me a strange look for that one.

1785
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:14,920
A glass jar full of oatmeal, Brent.

1786
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:15,520
I love you.

1787
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:16,480
You're so great.

1788
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:19,040
Yeah, what kind of glass jar?

1789
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:20,280
Like a mason jar, I'm picturing.

1790
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:21,400
It's got to be a mason jar.

1791
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:22,560
With a metal lid, though?

1792
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,120
Does it have a handle?

1793
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:24,880
No handle.

1794
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:27,120
It takes up too much room.

1795
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:27,680
Of course.

1796
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:29,160
But you get hot water on the plane

1797
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:31,960
and throw some chocolate in there, you're all good.

1798
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:33,000
Oh, my goodness.

1799
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,400
Clever.

1800
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,280
This is a travel hack we're getting.

1801
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:43,120
So you're getting the advantages of a dry, packable meal

1802
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,600
that you can then get hot water on the plane, you add,

1803
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:49,080
and you are also packing chocolates.

1804
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:50,520
This is huge, Brent.

1805
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:52,880
This is mind blowing.

1806
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,840
I am totally doing this on Wednesday.

1807
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:58,960
Why not just have a granola bar?

1808
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:02,400
Because it's hot and comfy, and the look on their face

1809
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:05,800
when they see a glass jar full of who knows what is priceless.

1810
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,720
Is that not considered, I guess, oatmeal's,

1811
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:09,240
I guess it makes sense.

1812
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:12,040
It's not like it's made oatmeal when you're going through TSA.

1813
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:13,720
It's not like liquid, right?

1814
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,600
I could see them thinking it's pretty weird.

1815
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,240
How far can you push the boundaries

1816
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:19,280
on taking stuff that is not liquid,

1817
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,480
but very clearly is made much better

1818
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:22,880
with hot water on the plane?

1819
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:23,960
How far can you go?

1820
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,960
Pobie, you do know that we have food in the States.

1821
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:27,960
You can just eat here.

1822
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,560
You don't have to pack the food.

1823
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:31,520
Well, yeah.

1824
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:34,080
So that's a big thing.

1825
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:36,040
All your filthy chlorine-washed chicken

1826
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:39,240
and like beef pumped full of barbiturates and stuff.

1827
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:40,760
I don't know if I can eat that.

1828
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:42,280
I've got to bring some oats.

1829
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:43,520
That's what I've got to do.

1830
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:44,040
Yeah.

1831
01:09:44,040 --> 01:10:11,600
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
