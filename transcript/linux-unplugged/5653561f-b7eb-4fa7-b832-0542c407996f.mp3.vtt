WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:04.120
Before we get into the show, I'm glad Wimpy's here because I bet he's noticed this

00:05.720 --> 00:09.560
Wimpy have you have you noticed that there is like a trend online now

00:09.760 --> 00:14.420
To just do like a screencast of Linux distros and and put some music to it like

00:15.760 --> 00:17.760
Have you noticed some of my posts?

00:18.080 --> 00:25.000
Here's like here's like here is exhibit a Ubuntu Mate 1604 here is exhibit B

00:25.000 --> 00:31.140
It was also very dramatic. Yeah, I like this one and then of course here is C right here. Here's a good one

00:32.400 --> 00:34.280
Yeah

00:34.280 --> 00:37.800
And of course you know you can put like elementary in there you can put solos in there

00:37.800 --> 00:43.520
You'll see all kinds of stuff come up like this is like a thing now. You've missed you've missed my favorite genre

00:43.520 --> 00:46.520
Oh, what's that? She's the this is the voice

00:47.080 --> 00:50.280
Synthesized reading. Oh, I have seen some of these

00:50.280 --> 00:54.600
Source site. Yeah, so you get these screen caps with a

00:55.920 --> 00:59.060
Yeah, it's yeah there and it's bad too. It's usually not so good

00:59.060 --> 01:03.540
Is there an audience for this shit? Is this something I should be doing here? Cuz I know okay

01:04.960 --> 01:09.180
Your audience is the people that show up in forums and that's all they've seen. Yeah, I guess

01:11.680 --> 01:18.680
The ones with music and stuff there is an audience for that and that's if you're wanting to

01:18.680 --> 01:20.680
demo something

01:22.120 --> 01:27.340
To an international audience, you know where you don't need to say anything where what you're doing is obvious and

01:28.080 --> 01:31.320
You know, why would you put a video up that has no sound at all?

01:31.800 --> 01:33.800
So I kind of can see

01:34.240 --> 01:40.360
An edge case for that, but they are growing in popularity and they have got sort of limited value

01:40.360 --> 01:47.760
This is Linux Unplugged episode 127 for January 12th, 2016

01:58.760 --> 02:04.140
Welcome to Linux Unplugged your weekly Linux podcast that's got a chicken in the slow cooker for dinner tonight

02:04.400 --> 02:08.200
My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hey there Wes. Guess what?

02:08.200 --> 02:10.680
We have a fun show on episode 127

02:10.680 --> 02:16.200
Oh a couple of topics that we've been fortunate enough to follow here on the unplugged show got some interesting updates this week

02:16.200 --> 02:21.960
So that's where we're gonna start then we're gonna get into feedback about butter FS as a home file system versus ZFS

02:21.960 --> 02:23.760
Oh, that's kind of nerdy

02:23.760 --> 02:30.400
Interview with the guys behind scale. There was a about a 10-minute interview. We ran in the Linux action show this Sunday. Well a

02:31.160 --> 02:35.200
Interesting part of that got left out got cut out from the interview so that we would fit in the show and we're gonna play

02:35.200 --> 02:41.200
That part it's about what's new at scale and what's big and different about scale in 2016. We'll play that and then

02:42.040 --> 02:44.040
Wes brace yourself

02:44.640 --> 02:46.640
for remix OS

02:47.000 --> 02:51.200
remix OS for the PC launch today, January 12th, 2016

02:52.200 --> 02:56.960
Are you excited? I am excited now. I don't know if I'm excited. We should try it and see we're gonna try it and see

02:56.960 --> 03:00.820
In fact, we're gonna try it and see we're gonna get a demo of it from them at the floor of CES

03:00.820 --> 03:05.800
I got more curious than excited. Yeah, I guess that's curious is the way to put it. And you know what Wes?

03:05.800 --> 03:10.380
I got a run right here on the machine. Oh, no way running right here on my machine in a virtual machine

03:10.380 --> 03:14.460
Well, that doesn't we'll do a little walk through right now. I know and then at the end of the show

03:15.720 --> 03:20.600
You ever get stuck being tech support and Fred with friends family. How do you get out of that?

03:20.600 --> 03:25.160
Or is it our duty? Is it our duty? We're gonna do a little debate deep questions here

03:25.160 --> 03:28.400
I know I know and you know how you know why we can do these deep probing

03:28.400 --> 03:34.360
Questions Wes. I think I do because we have that awesome mumble room time appropriate greetings virtual log

03:37.680 --> 03:44.040
Alright, so guess what we're gonna do a little topic updates before we get into that whole show and I love the name

03:44.040 --> 03:46.000
I mean, this is why I think one of the reasons we're doing in the show

03:46.000 --> 03:51.140
It's called snap craft snap craft 1.0 is a boon to snappy creator tool officially released

03:51.280 --> 03:55.240
It's canonical. It's got a tool out there now, and I don't know if anybody in the mumble room

03:55.240 --> 03:59.580
Might know any more about this than I do, but it's a new tool to generate

03:59.580 --> 04:04.360
I would assume custom snappy Ubuntu Linux images. It's pretty cool snap craft 1.0

04:04.400 --> 04:09.820
They're already talking about plans for a new version which is gonna support 1604 because the current one is based on

04:10.160 --> 04:11.920
1504 nice yeah

04:11.920 --> 04:15.880
And I think this is a great way to just let people go out there and make their own snappy based images

04:15.880 --> 04:20.000
I was wondering how exactly that custom tailoring was gonna work from like a hey

04:20.000 --> 04:24.920
I have an idea right and I want to use snappy to do it like let's say Ryan was sitting around here

04:24.920 --> 04:28.440
You know he's talking about doing the Minecraft project, and this is like you know down the road sure

04:28.440 --> 04:30.440
And you just want to go with Ubuntu snappy I

04:31.320 --> 04:34.360
Was kind of wondering what was that process like I think this kind of makes sense tools

04:34.360 --> 04:37.200
Do you need and I like the name snap craft? Yeah, that's fun

04:37.600 --> 04:40.980
You have any any insights or opinions poppy you want to share with the crowd?

04:42.040 --> 04:44.560
Yeah, it's kind of moved on pretty quickly

04:44.560 --> 04:49.880
I I don't work directly on snap craft or snapping myself, but I work with people who do of course and

04:49.880 --> 04:57.080
It's so it's it's a tool really for to overcome the problem that you know we've said we're gonna have a different

04:57.480 --> 05:01.440
packaging system in the personal desktop right and

05:02.760 --> 05:04.800
Part of the problem there is people say well

05:04.800 --> 05:08.600
I've got all these applications, and I I want them to be available to users

05:08.680 --> 05:11.480
But I don't want to have to learn a whole new packaging system

05:11.480 --> 05:14.320
It's hard enough to create RPMs and devs and whatever else

05:14.320 --> 05:19.000
I don't have to learn something else and that's where snap graph was born you create a single yaml file

05:19.000 --> 05:24.520
That defines the configuration run snap craft and boom out out pops a snappy package

05:24.520 --> 05:29.200
And you chuck it in the store, and you're done that sounds very easy to use yeah, that's great

05:29.440 --> 05:32.200
Hard to get simpler than yaml really yeah, yeah

05:32.200 --> 05:35.440
I wonder if you're gonna see I wonder if you're gonna see just

05:35.520 --> 05:40.480
This will just be like the obvious choice since there's something here to do now like there's just the same make these there

05:40.480 --> 05:43.480
I focus on robot operating system tools is kind of interesting

05:44.200 --> 05:46.200
Just like that term

05:46.200 --> 05:53.600
Yeah, you know operating systems for robots. Oh, man snappy will be the end of us all so I want to just give a mention

05:53.600 --> 05:56.880
We are we do have a beverage that West brought in look at this

05:56.880 --> 06:01.800
This is the vertex IPA that we're drinking on the show today with a BA score of 81

06:02.320 --> 06:07.720
That's not that's not super great for bear advocate. No. It's not no. It's not super great. What do you think though?

06:07.720 --> 06:12.080
It's got a 76 IBU. It's all right. Yeah, I was hoping for more honestly yeah

06:12.080 --> 06:17.000
Yeah, so you kind of you're agreeing with the yeah, I think so. I mean it's not bad. It's a fine beer all right

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Well, let's crack. We'll crack up on our second one

06:19.480 --> 06:24.800
And we'll be drinking this throughout the show if you at home want to pause and grab yourself an IPA you get to play along

06:24.800 --> 06:29.340
With our home version of the game also a virtual lug you're welcome to crack one open

06:30.320 --> 06:36.120
So did you see the news that KD plasma 5.6 has a new feature and that feature is

06:37.040 --> 06:40.720
support for the unity launcher according to a

06:40.720 --> 06:43.240
A developer on this is over on softpedia

06:43.440 --> 06:46.320
Grinding an article over on softpedia from a from a developer

06:46.320 --> 06:48.320
They're citing the new KD 5

06:48.580 --> 06:55.880
5.6 release will focus on being more user-friendly by removing any functionality that you the user think stands in your way to accomplish your daily tasks

06:56.200 --> 07:02.560
Like maybe removing activities there will be a lot of new features and updated applications in KD plasma 5.6 as well

07:02.800 --> 07:05.860
Let's start with the new unity

07:05.860 --> 07:13.420
Launcher support as it would appear that KD plasma 5.6 will borrow the unity API from canonicals Ubuntu Linux operating system

07:14.100 --> 07:18.980
To implement support for app notifications in the task manager for example

07:19.580 --> 07:22.240
Chromium web browser without a slip display download progress

07:23.060 --> 07:25.060
Telegram yeah, yeah

07:25.820 --> 07:31.460
but KD devs are planning to extend the functionality to a major of other majority of other applications to like dolphin and

07:31.460 --> 07:36.740
And other task manager and Thunderbird and whatnot I look forward to better media controls

07:36.740 --> 07:39.540
I mean, I think we've all enjoyed that for yeah, it's meant and go

07:41.460 --> 07:45.180
What is going on here exactly what's going on what's going? I mean, I love it

07:45.180 --> 07:50.020
I'm not I'm not disappointed in any sense of them of the word, but oh, why why why are we doing this?

07:50.020 --> 07:52.380
It seems like a change. Yeah style

07:53.180 --> 07:58.620
Interaction for the I just does anybody in the mobile room have any theories on why all of a sudden the plot of the KD

07:58.620 --> 08:02.420
Plat KD plasma desktop all of a sudden has an interest this far into the project

08:03.020 --> 08:04.700
Am I missing something?

08:04.700 --> 08:11.380
Well, isn't it just functionality? They don't already have they don't have the little progress bar on the icon all the

08:11.980 --> 08:16.340
Labels in the corner, and so they need to do it, so they're going with this right a sane API

08:16.340 --> 08:21.140
I can borrow it in the same way that you know we use components out of KDE on Ubuntu

08:21.140 --> 08:24.420
They now imagine if we just did this on a broader scale, okay?

08:24.940 --> 08:26.700
Just stop and imagine for a second

08:26.700 --> 08:30.740
You know what jumped out at me though, and I don't really know what this means, and I don't know if anybody has any insights

08:32.220 --> 08:37.980
It's gonna focus on being more user-friendly by removing any functionality that you the user think stands in your way to accomplish your daily

08:37.980 --> 08:39.540
Tasks what the heck does that mean?

08:39.540 --> 08:42.900
Sounds like they're gonna go gnome 3 on this business. I'm sure that's not that so

08:43.540 --> 08:50.020
It's kind of confusing when you read that it was a little removing activities. They're gonna go gnome 3 up on this business

08:50.020 --> 08:56.940
Yeah, that's what I was thinking although. I'm curious about it. I'm really curious about it, so we'll see I was you know I was

08:56.940 --> 09:01.260
Reading the blog post of some Linux switchers recently and they landed on plasma desktop and loved it

09:01.860 --> 09:09.700
So it appeals it a story to hear and I I really like that they're going with the unity API notification API because

09:10.980 --> 09:12.980
Well a crap ton of stuff already uses that

09:13.620 --> 09:19.740
So I I have gone on the record in the past and talked about butter fs and my issues with it

09:19.740 --> 09:23.900
And you know I I think I kind of you know it's interesting

09:23.900 --> 09:30.020
You know apparently to according to the Linux action show subreddit. I am just a strong hater of butter fs

09:30.020 --> 09:32.020
I'm a basher of butter fs

09:32.940 --> 09:34.940
Under the subreddit you paid a lot of things

09:35.940 --> 09:38.500
It's just mostly my name hard to be hard to be around you

09:40.100 --> 09:42.100
No do go on

09:42.100 --> 09:49.740
Oh, hey, it's Danica Patrick. Enjoy this episode and use code Linux all right, so here is here's the question

09:50.860 --> 09:55.100
In episode 399 you talked about ZFS as being more designed for the enterprise

09:55.300 --> 10:00.380
While butter fs is more suited for home use, but you never really said why you think that could you explain?

10:00.380 --> 10:02.600
Why you think this thanks love the show?

10:03.140 --> 10:06.820
Butter fs and so I wanted to give my background with butter fs so I had it on five rigs

10:06.820 --> 10:08.740
I got it still running on two of those rigs

10:08.740 --> 10:13.940
Servers laptops desktops your names it I've tried it on a bunch of different rigs for the most part

10:13.940 --> 10:20.460
I didn't have a really great time however butter fs. I think for a for a little bit of a

10:21.260 --> 10:27.380
Little bit simpler a little bit easier to understand doesn't have some of the same memory requirements as the fs has which is a big

10:27.380 --> 10:29.260
one for the home desktop and

10:29.260 --> 10:34.340
I think butter fs is a little more like you can work on mounted file systems in a way

10:34.340 --> 10:35.440
You can't work on them with set fs

10:35.440 --> 10:42.740
but the other thing about ZFS and you know even even huge advocates like Alan will admit this it truly is a

10:42.860 --> 10:50.020
file system designed from the enterprise standpoint from the very beginning and that includes the budget of an enterprise so in a lot of

10:50.020 --> 10:52.140
Times the the best-case scenario is well

10:52.140 --> 10:55.140
You should do that with two or four drives at a time two or four drives at a time

10:55.140 --> 10:58.420
I can't afford to do two or four drives at a time all the time right so

10:58.580 --> 11:01.500
Butter fs if you were working on a tighter budget you have less RAM

11:02.460 --> 11:03.860
very flexible

11:03.860 --> 11:07.740
Yeah, maybe you don't drive. Maybe you want copy-on-write. Maybe you don't want copy-on-write

11:07.740 --> 11:12.300
There's just there's a lot of things like with butter fs that it's gonna come built into your Linux distribution

11:12.300 --> 11:13.820
It's gonna be right out of the box

11:13.820 --> 11:17.360
It's gonna be a little bit easier to set up because you're gonna have built-in tools to use it

11:17.420 --> 11:19.060
Because they're gonna be built into the installer

11:19.060 --> 11:22.840
It doesn't require quite the amount of memory that ZFS does if you really want to push it

11:22.880 --> 11:24.980
So there's a lot of things about butter fs

11:24.980 --> 11:30.740
I think that are better for home users just because it's that sort of starting spot for butter fs

11:30.740 --> 11:37.060
Where ZFS especially in 1604 there's gonna be no graphical front-end hookups to it as far as we know at this point

11:37.060 --> 11:39.780
It's all command-line to set it up. It's just not really

11:40.660 --> 11:45.060
Feasible for home users. I think for my next home box. I'll build I think I might do ZFS

11:45.740 --> 11:50.780
Yeah, and if you were you know if you're a confident administrator if you want to take the time to you know really invest

11:50.820 --> 11:53.420
It's great for that and you know it performs very well

11:53.420 --> 11:55.020
It's a wonderful file system

11:55.020 --> 11:56.060
Mm-hmm, but I think you're right

11:56.060 --> 12:01.460
I think what you talked about too with like it works very well and butter fs works very well kind of in the cloud environments

12:01.460 --> 12:07.020
For service that you're gonna spin up. You just want you know you want root snapshots, etc. Yeah, yeah

12:07.700 --> 12:11.700
Wimpy, how long until Ubuntu Mate edition that lets me use ZFS from the install menu?

12:13.780 --> 12:15.780
That's a very good question

12:15.780 --> 12:21.580
There's a couple of file systems. I'd like to see added to Ubiquiti and you never know I've made a few

12:21.580 --> 12:29.060
contributions to Ubiquiti in the last year or so and I might make some more I'd like to see f2fs in there as well

12:29.060 --> 12:31.740
Mm-hmm, I do I do picture myself

12:31.740 --> 12:36.920
I don't know if you listen to tech talk today, but we covered the the new Skylake

12:37.460 --> 12:41.220
NUCs that I haven't been announced yet, but they were Intel is talking about it CES

12:41.740 --> 12:46.020
There's Skylake. They've got Thunderbolt 3. They've got PCI Express 3 Oh

12:46.020 --> 12:50.100
So the you know the PCI the PCI hard drives are gonna just be crazy fast awesome

12:50.100 --> 12:53.020
and you know you could get a couple of those things in there and

12:54.260 --> 13:00.900
Maybe an external drive array over Thunderbolt 3 using ZFS that could be I mean that could be a really nice Linux rig

13:02.140 --> 13:04.220
I'm definitely excited for the Ubuntu ZFS

13:04.220 --> 13:05.020
I use a

13:05.020 --> 13:10.620
LXC for a lot of development stuff and use ZFS for snapshots on the back end and right now you have to install the PPA

13:10.620 --> 13:12.620
And you know if it's more integrated

13:12.980 --> 13:18.960
Yeah, so I think that's sort of my thought anybody else have thoughts on using ZFS for your home or day-to-day rig as you know

13:18.960 --> 13:20.960
Just maybe single hard drive even

13:22.440 --> 13:26.640
It's a great choice if you want integrity I used to do this all the time the problem is I wanted to be able to

13:26.640 --> 13:28.640
Defrag my disk and so I had to go back to butter FS

13:29.920 --> 13:32.660
Yeah, yeah, that was really the main thing that pushed you back

13:33.360 --> 13:37.880
Yeah, just getting performance out of it as it pushed me back really even though. I did have a lot of RAM

13:38.640 --> 13:41.200
Just having it fragment itself over time was kind of a problem

13:41.200 --> 13:45.120
And I mean I could reformat you know every six months or something kind of alleviate the problem

13:45.120 --> 13:50.000
But I felt like butter FS was just worth it because I was keeping good backups anyway

13:50.000 --> 13:53.500
I wasn't too worried about my data being silently corrupted. That's not gonna happen

13:53.500 --> 13:57.960
It's gonna be very loud when it gets corrupted, and so if it did I would just revert to a backup right

13:57.960 --> 14:02.560
I never even had that happen butter FS has been rock-solid at least tells you you know pretty right

14:02.560 --> 14:05.880
You guys it's pretty obvious and butter FS is going to correct your data if it does

14:05.880 --> 14:11.800
And I just haven't had that issue so as long as you're keeping good backups. I don't see the problem. Yeah, yeah, okay, so mr.

14:11.800 --> 14:17.480
Kitty you think it's kind of telling that before butter if s even got a chance ZFS is already arriving for Linux

14:18.240 --> 14:21.420
Yeah, I thought it was really weird especially you know BF

14:22.280 --> 14:24.200
Btrfs being native

14:24.200 --> 14:26.120
to Linux whereas

14:26.120 --> 14:32.560
ZFS is something that takes a lot of work to have to pour it over and all this and that and it is rather telling

14:32.560 --> 14:34.240
That's something that was

14:34.240 --> 14:36.240
worked on for years

14:36.240 --> 14:42.040
Is not as ready as something that they had to pour it over and all that well

14:42.120 --> 14:44.760
You know ZFS has been worked on for years, too. Yeah

14:47.480 --> 14:53.680
It's not like Btrfs didn't get get a chance it had its opportunity. Yeah, I agree

14:53.680 --> 14:59.060
I think the market. I think the market is speaking right now saying you know what we watched it for a while and now

14:59.800 --> 15:03.400
Now we know that our customers want something they can trust and the brand

15:03.400 --> 15:08.200
ZFS is just stronger than brand butter fs and that's why you know

15:08.640 --> 15:10.640
canonicals willing to shiv it into a

15:10.880 --> 15:15.440
LTS using DKMS to make it possible for you because they cussed the customer demand

15:15.440 --> 15:18.820
They're so strong that that all of a sudden is deemed LTS worthy

15:19.200 --> 15:26.160
Because they need it in a long-term supported distro that people are shipping on their servers because that's where the customer demand is and I think

15:26.160 --> 15:30.360
That right there demonstrates how much demand there must be seen if they're willing to do that

15:30.360 --> 15:35.200
I also think the enterprise requirements are so you know so serious like that data really matters in some

15:35.600 --> 15:36.760
environments and like

15:36.760 --> 15:40.720
BSD now they interviewed Joss Pate's pixel from IX systems

15:40.720 --> 15:44.960
Yeah, and he said like you know open ZFS has been around for like 10 years and even now

15:44.960 --> 15:50.600
It's still an immature file system, so yeah, that's the case for ZFS right it makes sense that that would that's that is

15:50.600 --> 15:55.160
That is absolutely how enterprises think yeah, of course they cover this a lot on BSD now

15:55.160 --> 16:01.600
Yeah, they yeah that interview with Josh is great because Josh is out in the field supporting a lot of different people's I

16:01.880 --> 16:04.360
Jokingly called him the pool boy, but he's out there supporting a lot of people's

16:04.760 --> 16:06.120
CFS pools in production

16:06.120 --> 16:10.720
And he's just you know he's just seen a huge aggregate of data and so he's a I mean

16:10.720 --> 16:14.760
He's a in real world expert on it, and so he was over to IX systems

16:14.760 --> 16:17.920
And they let us talk to him and so yeah, that was a great episode

16:17.920 --> 16:21.640
That was just last week's episode of BSD now to go check that out

16:21.640 --> 16:26.040
Hmm. Yeah, all right the downtime is expensive data recovery is expensive and RAM and dis are cheap

16:26.120 --> 16:30.720
That's how the enterprise looks at ZFS, and that's why I really when I say it's an enterprise grade file system

16:30.720 --> 16:33.300
It's even meant from an enterprise budget, but our FS

16:33.300 --> 16:40.460
I think still has long-term potential, but I just think its potential is it's not gonna be these huge data sets

16:40.960 --> 16:45.460
And I think for some of us who are willing to do the administrative overhead or understand you know

16:45.460 --> 16:51.160
Philosophically what's great about file systems like CFS that are constantly doing checks on me and things like that we might choose to go

16:51.160 --> 16:53.660
CFS over butter fs even though it offers some of the same features

16:54.460 --> 17:01.300
So what will be what will be interesting to see is now that now the ZFS is sort of making gains in the Linux world

17:02.940 --> 17:04.940
It'll be interesting to see if

17:05.500 --> 17:07.500
B3FS just loses

17:07.900 --> 17:09.900
appeal at all or

17:09.900 --> 17:16.460
If it will be a slow burner and five ten years from now it will emerge as an alternative

17:16.620 --> 17:20.300
Yeah, it seems to me like because it because it's almost like the precious off now

17:20.940 --> 17:28.740
Yeah, I almost wonder if it won't be like you format your root or your home partitions or var or user you format

17:28.740 --> 17:33.460
Those in butter fs and your slash data or storage partitions are in ZFS

17:33.660 --> 17:38.500
because I wonder if one of the things that wouldn't push butter fs forward just for like the OS base OS is

17:38.500 --> 17:43.540
Maybe some sort of software deployment that uses butter fs sub volumes to deploy software

17:44.020 --> 17:46.500
Sort of like the Mac OS uses sparse volumes

17:46.980 --> 17:50.780
HFS sparse volumes to deploy software we've talked to Lenart about that

17:50.780 --> 17:55.140
And he says that's in that's entirely possible that you know we would mount a butter fs

17:55.580 --> 17:58.860
Volume and you would do a copy from the file systems

17:58.860 --> 18:00.480
You'd have the entire file system structure

18:00.480 --> 18:03.060
And it would be make a lot of sense that you would have butter fs

18:03.060 --> 18:06.600
Do you wouldn't have to have butter fs on your current file system to be able to mount a butter fs file system?

18:06.600 --> 18:12.740
But I could really see it I could see a you know integrating with snapshots and all that just makes Linux administration easy

18:12.740 --> 18:14.580
And it's just it's built right into the kernel

18:14.580 --> 18:19.140
And I could just see it over the next few years becoming used for that and then you just run it like that for a decade

18:19.140 --> 18:20.640
And it's gonna be a pretty tried and dreaming

18:20.640 --> 18:25.700
That's that's really how extended got its start, and then it you know it's a tried-and-true vial system now

18:26.640 --> 18:30.980
So you don't think it's too early to call better fs

18:31.460 --> 18:34.660
Dead on arrival yet. No I don't think so

18:34.660 --> 18:37.140
I don't know you don't know not for a lot of work cases

18:37.140 --> 18:40.940
I think there might be some workloads where the brand is too tarnished for at least a while

18:40.940 --> 18:43.140
Yeah, I don't think it's I don't think in the next two three

18:43.140 --> 18:49.000
I don't know I just kind of unfortunate because zfs had so much more money poured into it than butter fs

18:49.000 --> 18:50.020
Did to start off with yeah?

18:50.020 --> 18:50.500
Yeah

18:50.500 --> 18:55.540
Like they had it under development for five years at Sun before it was released and they were pouring money in via developers at least

18:55.540 --> 18:59.760
Three at a time yeah, whereas butter fs had Chris Mason for what a couple years on its own

19:00.020 --> 19:03.360
Yeah, people sending in patches is a totally different paradigm

19:03.360 --> 19:06.500
It's still only like four or five people. It's not the same community

19:07.740 --> 19:10.820
And we've also got B cache fs

19:11.180 --> 19:17.300
which has grown up out of the B cache initiative and they've now turned that into a

19:17.900 --> 19:22.020
Full file system, so that's going to be another copy-on-write file system

19:22.260 --> 19:27.600
So it'll be interesting to see how that develops over the coming years and whether you know

19:27.600 --> 19:33.800
Is it b3 fs could it be cache fs is it going to be z fs, but you know those desktop type?

19:34.560 --> 19:36.560
scenarios you're looking at where you're doing

19:36.800 --> 19:39.160
snapshots of your system by means of

19:39.680 --> 19:44.780
backup for restore for continuity of running your machine I think

19:45.280 --> 19:51.260
The jury's still out on that one. I think there's several contenders to open that space mm-hmm. Yeah, I agree

19:51.900 --> 19:55.520
Yeah, boy is the and you know what at the end of the day?

19:55.520 --> 19:59.280
We just have to remember we're in better shape than the Mac right. That's all that matters

20:01.320 --> 20:06.880
Sorry I couldn't help myself and cfs is better than hfs plus come on. I know I know you see I didn't

20:09.720 --> 20:14.080
Okay, so I want to talk about scale because there's some big changes that have happened plus

20:14.080 --> 20:19.400
We have some interview stuff that I think it's pretty neat that we didn't get a chance to talk about before so let's take a moment

20:19.400 --> 20:24.360
And tell you about how I'm gonna stay connected while I'm going down to scale and that's ting go to Linux dot ting

20:24.360 --> 20:27.840
Dot-com to support this show and get our discount ting is great

20:27.840 --> 20:30.520
It's no contract and you only pay for what you use

20:30.600 --> 20:32.600
Just your minutes your messages in your megabytes

20:32.600 --> 20:37.560
And they have a great dashboard to manage all of it that makes it really easy as a really easy and obvious as heck

20:37.640 --> 20:44.960
Where you're at Linux dot ting comm you'll get a $25 discount off your first device or West whoa little insider tip

20:45.160 --> 20:48.440
They have GSM and CDMA no way I thought that was impossible

20:48.520 --> 20:51.120
So if you got a phone compatible with one of their networks

20:51.120 --> 20:56.440
You can bring it over and get $25 of service credit just saying and they have great devices unlocked you own them outright

20:56.440 --> 21:03.360
Or you can bring your own and manage it all with either the ting dashboard the ting mobile app or tings awesome radical customer

21:03.480 --> 21:07.600
Support no contracts. No early termination fees. I said no contracts

21:07.760 --> 21:11.520
Yeah, if you stuck in a duopoly contract because you know they're even they're thinking about dropping those things

21:11.800 --> 21:17.680
They have an ETF relief program if you want a company that thinks that your internet should just be a dumb pipe go check out

21:17.680 --> 21:22.020
Ting go check out ting they they believe in the dumb pipe they want

21:22.160 --> 21:25.560
They want you to take their dumb pipe and put it in your device

21:25.560 --> 21:31.280
That's what they want you embrace tings pipe go to look at refuse ting could you no no they got a dumb pipe and they

21:31.280 --> 21:37.520
Want you to take it go to Linux dot com check out their store browse around see what they've got and also if you've been

21:37.520 --> 21:41.200
Thinking about it experiment with their savings calculator that thing is a lot of fun

21:41.200 --> 21:46.440
It's nicely designed it is and you know you can actually plug it into your existing account if you want and then go get that

21:46.440 --> 21:50.960
Business and also did you see the news that ting got a great rating from Consumer Reports?

21:51.360 --> 21:55.560
It's pretty great Linux dot ting comm rate as an understatement there five things

21:55.560 --> 21:59.360
You didn't know Google now could do they have a great blog too. They got a ting tip

21:59.640 --> 22:04.320
You know that Google now it does all kinds of things look at that. This is really nice. They put all that together

22:04.320 --> 22:06.320
I'm not gonna spoil it for you

22:06.680 --> 22:12.360
Also, did you know that Siri can beatbox? Did you know that no? I didn't yeah, let's try it right now. You're ready, okay?

22:12.360 --> 22:16.360
This is live every okay. Let's give it a shot. Hey Siri beatbox. Here's

22:18.680 --> 22:24.280
One I've been practicing boots and cats and boots and cats and boots and cats and boots and cats and boots

22:24.720 --> 22:30.080
Do this all day cats and boots and yeah, no we're good. We're good. You know what so they got the iOS devices

22:30.080 --> 22:33.480
They got the Android devices. They have the feature phones all ranging at different prices

22:33.680 --> 22:39.640
No contract you only pay for what you use the devices unlocked including they got the zing back again

22:39.640 --> 22:44.200
Which gives you that nice screen that tells you exactly how much data you've used you can manage the Wi-Fi password

22:44.200 --> 22:46.560
It is like what I'll show it to you right now

22:46.680 --> 22:52.160
This is like you know you know you know those really crappy my fight devices that have like they're really crappy web interface

22:52.160 --> 22:56.360
Oh, you have to wait till they're crappy DHCP server finally gets running to get one of their IP addresses

22:56.360 --> 23:01.520
You can log doesn't register host names. It doesn't know so the zing it's all just right here on the touchscreen

23:01.520 --> 23:06.360
You get to see the Wi-Fi password. You can change the Wi-Fi password. You can see devices connected. I love it

23:06.360 --> 23:11.200
Oh, wow also is connected right there. Yes. Yeah, that's great. They all they offer the karma, too

23:11.200 --> 23:17.240
if you want to get on that karma business that go check them out linux.ting.com great devices great plans great people and

23:18.240 --> 23:20.240
big supporters of net neutrality

23:20.400 --> 23:24.260
linux.ting.com and a big thanks to ting for supporting linux unplugged

23:24.760 --> 23:26.760
Linux.ting.com

23:27.480 --> 23:30.640
All right, so first up a couple of things about scale. I want to mention I

23:30.640 --> 23:37.920
Had to move the time I had to move the time alone. Yeah, yeah, so we go and set up our meeting and then Cory Doctor

23:37.920 --> 23:42.040
Oh, he's like hey. You know what that looks like a great time and day. I'm gonna schedule my you know

23:42.040 --> 23:44.160
Yeah, so he scheduled his keynote for that time

23:44.200 --> 23:49.320
So I'm like well, and you know what I really love is like some people in the meeper like I'll still come

23:49.320 --> 23:50.880
I'll skip Cory Doctor's keynote

23:50.880 --> 23:53.400
I'm like oh my god that guy is so cool the one guys like well

23:53.400 --> 23:57.240
I could come for like a little bit, and then I could maybe like sneak out, and I'm like no

23:57.240 --> 24:01.760
Here's what we're gonna. Do we're gonna change. We're gonna just change it so that way we can all go see Cory Doctor's keynote

24:01.760 --> 24:06.040
And instead of doing it really early so a whole bunch of geeks have to get up early after partying at scale

24:06.040 --> 24:07.280
We're gonna do it at lunch

24:07.280 --> 24:12.920
and then you can go recruit other folks at lunch and then bring them to the meetup and we'll convert them to the Jupiter

24:12.920 --> 24:17.800
Broadcasting way if you're gonna be down in Pasadena at scale go to meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting

24:18.160 --> 24:20.160
We got 21 people going already

24:20.360 --> 24:24.040
We're gonna get a power lunch after Cory Doctor's keynote and stuff

24:24.040 --> 24:30.120
Yeah, I'm pretty excited about it West so meetup calm slash Jupiter broadcasting if you want to get in on that

24:30.120 --> 24:32.960
You're gonna be there poppy. I added you to the event without even asking you

24:33.640 --> 24:35.960
I went to the meetup when you lost

24:40.880 --> 24:45.120
Who do I know that's gonna be down there, and I could give them admin access to this so that way if they need to do

24:45.120 --> 24:48.480
Something smart. I'm like well. I'll add poppy. He's gonna be down there. I trust him

24:48.480 --> 24:55.320
Yes, I just lost you in there already like good. That's taking care. That's love. Yeah, you know you got it

24:55.320 --> 24:59.320
You got to spread the love. I'm excited. I hope the lunch works out. I hope maybe we can bring a few extra friends

24:59.320 --> 25:03.160
You guys gotta show up. I mean you're anywhere near there. Yeah, it's gonna be good one

25:03.320 --> 25:06.080
And I don't know exactly how I'm getting there yet any of that's all up

25:06.080 --> 25:08.860
So maybe pick Chris up off the side of the road on your right. I'll be hitchin

25:09.320 --> 25:14.360
So I wanted to spend a little minute a couple of minutes here and play an interview

25:14.360 --> 25:18.920
From a couple of guys behind the scale effort now. There's a lot of people behind scale

25:18.920 --> 25:23.800
but Ilian and Gareth are one of the people are working very hard on bringing scale 14x together and

25:24.440 --> 25:26.600
Noah had a chance to talk with him last week

25:26.600 --> 25:30.880
We played a couple of minutes of their interview in the Linux action show and I got a couple of other minutes here

25:30.880 --> 25:33.400
I want to play for you about what's new at scale

25:33.400 --> 25:39.400
And what's kind of cool and separating it apart, and I think the context of it is you know things like ubi con check it out

25:39.400 --> 25:44.320
So we're one of the things that's happened with scale over the years as we've grown become a bit of a hub for other

25:44.320 --> 25:46.320
communities that want to run their events

25:46.800 --> 25:48.920
in or around us so

25:49.520 --> 25:51.520
for example will be you know the

25:52.080 --> 25:55.160
Bun to do the bun to community will be running ubu con

25:55.720 --> 26:02.760
Which is there is going to be their their new user and developer conference here at here at scale this year leading into that

26:03.360 --> 26:06.440
Similarly we have events from the Postgres community the mysql community

26:07.480 --> 26:09.280
DevOps day la so

26:09.280 --> 26:12.680
So when you come to scale really you're probably getting about ten events in in one

26:12.680 --> 26:14.680
Which is which is one great thing?

26:15.080 --> 26:20.000
So in terms of the keynotes that you mentioned. We've got folks like Cory doctor. Oh will be coming out

26:21.000 --> 26:23.400
mark shuttleworth will be a keynote as well talking about

26:25.200 --> 26:30.120
You know how open source fits in it fits in a world of app stores and embedded devices where we don't necessarily

26:30.400 --> 26:32.400
you know have access to the

26:32.560 --> 26:34.960
What we don't necessarily have access to

26:35.600 --> 26:38.560
You know to the source code as we're down from from apps or things like that

26:38.560 --> 26:42.960
And how do we make how do we continue to make open source be important in that in that sort of an environment?

26:43.560 --> 26:45.840
And then the last keynote will be Sarah sharp

26:46.520 --> 26:48.880
Talking about diversity in the open source community. She's a

26:49.600 --> 26:51.600
former Linux kernel developer that

26:52.400 --> 26:57.840
Has a lot of experience with with some of the challenges of being involved in our open source communities

26:58.280 --> 27:00.480
Yeah, yeah, that's absolutely terrific

27:01.000 --> 27:06.360
You know and the other thing that I I always look forward to in addition to the actual keynotes is

27:06.360 --> 27:09.200
a lot of the presentations that are given some you know

27:09.200 --> 27:15.740
They're not they're not necessarily everyone commuting in one big hall for one big presentation by a well-known name, but sometimes

27:16.400 --> 27:21.200
There are really cool presentations. I think it was last year or maybe it was a year before they had a

27:22.200 --> 27:27.200
Presentation of 20 Linux commands that you never knew that you needed but once you find out about them

27:27.200 --> 27:32.900
They should have been included by default in the distribution and man have I been able to implement some of that stuff

27:32.900 --> 27:38.060
Yeah, are there any particular presentations that you personally either of you are looking forward to seeing?

27:39.020 --> 27:43.060
Well, I mean going back to what I said before where we started the conference

27:43.660 --> 27:47.380
To to be a conference that we wanted to attend

27:47.380 --> 27:54.060
I think the ironic thing in that is that most of us never actually get to go to the presentations because we're busy

27:55.300 --> 27:57.420
Running the conference. Yeah. Yep

27:57.420 --> 28:03.180
and so but but one of the things that kind of touching on that I'm I'm always excited to see is

28:03.820 --> 28:06.420
Are those presentations kind of like what you mentioned?

28:07.460 --> 28:09.140
where you

28:09.140 --> 28:15.300
it's it's not a presentation that you necessarily or a talk that you necessarily think of a

28:15.660 --> 28:17.140
Head of time they're like, oh, yeah

28:17.140 --> 28:23.740
I'd really like to see a presentation on the 20 most commands that I didn't know about exactly. I'm excited about the presentations that

28:23.740 --> 28:31.180
Those type of presentations as well as the presentations by speakers that no one has ever heard of yeah because in my experience

28:31.780 --> 28:39.140
those always end up being really awesome presentations and the speakers end up becoming like really well-known speakers and and it just it's

28:39.540 --> 28:45.060
It makes me feel really good that they got their start at our event. Yeah, right on

28:45.060 --> 28:49.600
I'm I I can't tell you how excited I am to come to the conference

28:49.600 --> 28:54.260
So now I kind of I've been hogging the mic here for a little bit

28:54.260 --> 28:59.180
But West have you ever been to an event like scale before have you ever or have you gone to any kind of big?

28:59.180 --> 29:02.580
Linux convention where there's a lot of people coming in I went to scale once

29:02.580 --> 29:06.700
Oh you do you so I have been I tell you what I have been avoiding scale

29:06.700 --> 29:10.320
I've mentioned this before I've been avoiding scale from the very beginning just because it's you know

29:10.460 --> 29:14.300
Some of these some of the events they get too big and then I feel like I don't want to go to them anymore

29:14.300 --> 29:17.220
I'm kind of curious to see where they walk the line on this one

29:17.220 --> 29:22.060
But I'm maybe maybe next year. Maybe next year. We both go down. That sounds great. Wouldn't that be fun?

29:22.100 --> 29:24.580
That'd be really cool. And yeah

29:25.180 --> 29:31.220
So I hope to see you guys there at scale anybody in the mummer room any other any poppy anybody have any

29:31.700 --> 29:35.360
I've just had an email from one of the organizers saying that my talk has been accepted

29:38.540 --> 29:41.580
A thing that I developed with Stuart language

29:41.580 --> 29:42.020
I

29:42.020 --> 29:47.460
Kind of bought thing that we developed and it's quite cool and I wanted to talk about it and how we developed it now

29:47.460 --> 29:49.460
We did it in the community. Well

29:49.860 --> 29:53.540
That's awesome. Very nice. Very nice. You know, they rejected that Alan Jude

29:54.180 --> 29:59.740
Yeah, he had a time. Well, rightly so yeah, I know you want to talk about BSD BSD get that guy out of here

29:59.740 --> 30:03.140
So Linux Expo get him out of here. They can have a booth. Yeah

30:03.260 --> 30:09.380
Yeah, my here's my here would be my perfect scenario and I think I'm gonna do this at Linux fest Northwest

30:09.380 --> 30:15.780
Oh, I would be to park the rover outside the event and then just like have people come out like, you know

30:15.780 --> 30:16.620
Meet them on the ground be like, yeah

30:16.620 --> 30:21.580
Well, you come out to this location in the parking lot at this time and just do the interview there cryptic GPS cord

30:21.580 --> 30:24.540
It'd be amazing. Yeah, like a scavenger hunt

30:26.500 --> 30:27.660
Okay, now we're into it

30:27.660 --> 30:28.060
Okay

30:28.060 --> 30:32.700
so if we could do like a scavenger hunt where you could get little clues and they'd they'd walk around the event and then end up

30:32.700 --> 30:34.700
At the rover and then do an interview on JV

30:34.700 --> 30:39.940
That would be amazing, especially if we could have like GoPros mountain like key locations, right? Okay

30:39.940 --> 30:44.060
Well, maybe in the future one day we can dream big. You never know we dream now

30:44.420 --> 30:48.100
Maybe in a few years we can achieve the seeds of the future. These are the seeds

30:48.420 --> 30:51.660
Okay, so it's time for us to talk about remix OS

30:53.100 --> 30:59.460
Remix I'm gonna be honest. I didn't I didn't think they'd do it when I saw the when I saw the announcement

30:59.460 --> 31:01.340
I didn't even cover it as news

31:01.340 --> 31:06.080
Because I'm like, oh, come on. This is nothing. They got some crappy ARM based PC. That's too slow

31:07.100 --> 31:11.140
And I'm not interested in that and then they are gonna

31:11.780 --> 31:16.780
Supposedly release an ISO at some time in the future. When can I actually see this? Okay

31:16.780 --> 31:21.260
Yeah, let me know when the code ships and then we'll actually talk about it. Well today the code shipped

31:21.580 --> 31:25.660
Yeah, and they were at CES. They had a booth Wow giving demos

31:26.500 --> 31:28.340
So we're gonna cover all of that

31:28.340 --> 31:32.980
Remix OS is a desktop operating system based on Android

31:33.860 --> 31:35.860
and the idea is

31:36.180 --> 31:38.260
To turn Android into a desktop

31:39.460 --> 31:41.240
productivity

31:41.240 --> 31:42.220
platform

31:42.220 --> 31:47.660
So instead of just content consumption, right you can do content creation. So they're introducing windowing

31:47.860 --> 31:54.620
They're introducing file managers and things like this a launch bar and a menu all these people you're gonna will show you more about it

31:54.620 --> 31:56.620
And they're calling it remix OS

31:56.620 --> 32:01.980
You know the idea would be it's a it's a serious contender to something like Chrome OS or

32:02.500 --> 32:08.700
Even perhaps the Linux desktop itself itself. Yeah, so before we get into that, I'm gonna mention Linux Academy

32:09.100 --> 32:14.980
Love Linux Academy. This has been something really fun to watch throughout 2015 is to see them grow and they're not done in 2016

32:14.980 --> 32:17.060
In fact coming up on the 14th. They've got a big event

32:17.060 --> 32:23.540
It's got they got some announcements you can tune in and find out Linux Academy is a great platform to learn about all the technologies

32:23.540 --> 32:25.540
around Linux and Linux itself

32:25.540 --> 32:27.540
Start by going to linuxacademy.com

32:28.020 --> 32:33.060
Unplugged that supports the show keeps us going. Let's Linux Academy know you heard about it here

32:34.060 --> 32:39.600
They have so much to learn and and even if you've been using Linux forever

32:39.820 --> 32:41.340
There's so much good stuff

32:41.340 --> 32:48.300
Like not only are you gonna appreciate the fact that people just truly enthusiastic compassionate about this are putting together putting together a great system

32:48.820 --> 32:54.220
But as somebody who has like a pretty good sense of what's up and coming in the Linux world

32:54.220 --> 32:58.440
I'm pretty damn impressed with what they've been able to turn around into great courseware and content

32:59.180 --> 33:00.500
They have over

33:00.500 --> 33:02.500
2,000 courses with video

33:02.940 --> 33:09.180
instructor help is available downloadable comprehensive study guides distros all up the wazoo you can choose from and the courseware adjust to that

33:09.420 --> 33:15.240
Virtual servers you SSH into they spin up on-demand as part of the courseware. I gotta say it again instructor

33:15.240 --> 33:17.240
Help is available when you need it. I

33:17.580 --> 33:22.860
Really think this is a platform you should check out. I would say to like if you've been stuck in a spot for a while

33:22.860 --> 33:24.140
you

33:24.140 --> 33:28.580
Need to kind of see what interests you you want to kind of see what direction you want to go to this is a safe

33:28.580 --> 33:34.620
Playground because they have graded server exercises while you're working on the system. You're gonna get real-time information and feedback

33:35.580 --> 33:38.220
That's gonna give you a sense of where your strengths are pretty quickly

33:38.580 --> 33:43.740
We just keep seeing success stories of people who've gotten the job after studying at Linux Academy

33:43.740 --> 33:46.500
You know there's a lot of interest in this area

33:46.500 --> 33:50.900
Yeah, if you can show that you you know through something like Linux Academy that you're a competent

33:50.900 --> 33:54.340
Yeah, that is a nice thing to as Linux Academy is a rising star

33:54.420 --> 34:00.340
You you rise with them people in the industry know it already. Yeah, they have some really neat technology

34:00.340 --> 34:05.340
Their scenario based labs are pretty unique the fact that they're following the technologies that they are following are great

34:05.340 --> 34:08.020
You know their nugget system for when you don't have a lot of time

34:08.020 --> 34:11.300
You just want to deep dive into a single topic it makes a lot of sense

34:11.900 --> 34:18.380
They were on top they had some of the first and best content on openstack before anybody else because when that was becoming a huge

34:18.380 --> 34:23.120
Thing like well this is obvious right you know I know same thing with Docker right the same thing with a lot of the technologies

34:23.120 --> 34:27.060
Built around Linux now and including AWS that entire infrastructure I

34:28.220 --> 34:31.180
Really like it, and they've got some great stuff coming up. Just around the corner

34:31.180 --> 34:36.460
They're gonna announce on the 14th go to Linux Academy comm slash unplugged. You'll get our discount. That's the big thing

34:36.460 --> 34:38.460
But also you support this show

34:38.940 --> 34:45.260
This is a really solid platform, and if I worked in a job where my educator paid for like a little bit of oh

34:45.260 --> 34:48.620
Right or why my employer paid for a little bit of education

34:48.620 --> 34:53.660
Oh, man that like when I when I had when I was when I worked for somebody else a lot of times

34:53.660 --> 34:56.300
I was just here's the budget first for self education

34:56.340 --> 35:01.120
You know they can take online courses I could go to like a to a local you know a college

35:01.580 --> 35:06.660
But this is a great option. This is a really great option so Linux Academy comm slash unplugged

35:07.660 --> 35:09.700
Stay up to date on current technologies, too

35:09.940 --> 35:12.340
That's what's really cool about it is you can get all the current stuff

35:12.340 --> 35:18.660
Experts were really passionate about it instructor help available on-demand and you support this show holy smokes

35:19.340 --> 35:24.840
That's a win-win-win Linux Academy comm slash unplugged so remix OS

35:25.380 --> 35:29.460
I've been kicking the tires a little bit anybody in the mumble room tried remix OS

35:30.300 --> 35:33.100
Yep, all right, okay, okay, so

35:36.260 --> 35:38.420
Installing right now all right well before we talk about it

35:38.420 --> 35:42.700
Let me set up a little bit about remix OS and they have a they have a video here to do that for us

35:42.700 --> 35:44.700
So yeah, what's up?

35:45.260 --> 35:49.820
This is this is at CES. He takes a thumb drive. He plugs it into a Dell PC

35:50.420 --> 35:55.780
We're here at CES 2016, and we're really excited to announce remix OS for PCs

35:55.940 --> 36:01.660
It's a project a collaborative project between Android x86 and ourselves and on January 12th

36:01.660 --> 36:05.420
It'll be available for free download globally, so let's take a look

36:05.420 --> 36:10.060
Oh, this is the guest mode resident mode selection screen one saves no data

36:10.060 --> 36:15.540
That's a guest mode and the other saves all your data and apps. That's the resident mode, so let's go in and check it out

36:16.420 --> 36:22.500
On the 12th when you download you're going to get two files. What is an iso file one is an exe file?

36:22.540 --> 36:25.940
You're going to plug in a usb drive to a PC of your choice

36:25.940 --> 36:32.260
And you're going to run the exe file load the iso file into that program and then install it onto a usb drive

36:32.460 --> 36:34.460
all right, so we've done that and

36:34.460 --> 36:38.780
Probably what were your first thoughts when you had tried it out, and what did you try it on I?

36:41.140 --> 36:47.500
Don't know I tried in a VM. I I didn't want to dedicate a machine to this. Yeah, that's what I did here

36:47.500 --> 36:55.300
I've I've tried Android x86 on you know various machines in the past, and I thought I'd give this a go, but

36:55.940 --> 36:57.940
two things kind of threw me

36:58.780 --> 37:00.460
one

37:00.460 --> 37:05.320
I'm guessing you've tried it. Have you read the end user license agreement? No, I didn't that was I've not gotten there

37:05.320 --> 37:11.440
That's not the first thing I did. Yeah, I'm guessing yeah, I'm guessing most people would you probably want to read it?

37:11.440 --> 37:15.380
It's interesting and some of it is probably copy and pasted from

37:15.980 --> 37:20.760
Somewhere else and you can guess where from if I read you three lines from the EULA if that's okay. Yeah

37:21.740 --> 37:28.080
You agree that you irrevocably waive any and all ownership legal and moral rights to your user content

37:28.080 --> 37:34.240
How's that sounds like that sounds like they got it from Google, right? Okay? This one will give you a better clue

37:34.840 --> 37:40.420
You're also not allowed to oppose the basic principles determined in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China

37:40.920 --> 37:46.820
Harm its national honor or interests or undermine its national religious policy promoting cults and superstitions

37:47.480 --> 37:52.600
What you're not allowed to spread rumor disturb social order or undermine social stability

37:52.600 --> 37:57.000
Okay, so that's a little odd. Yeah

37:59.240 --> 38:01.160
Those are my favorite things to do

38:01.160 --> 38:03.000
Well, I mean you're outside China

38:03.000 --> 38:07.560
So, you know good luck People's Republic of China for enforcing those rules on those of us in the free West

38:07.560 --> 38:11.000
But if you did any of those things and then you went to China

38:11.600 --> 38:13.600
Might have a bit of a problem, huh?

38:13.680 --> 38:17.880
Don't go to China Chris. So yeah, cuz yeah, I definitely can't go to China

38:17.880 --> 38:22.840
So I've done all of those just in the last ten minutes. That sounds like a copy-pasta little thing, right? I mean, that's gotta be

38:22.840 --> 38:28.720
There's other Chinese companies that have that the Xiaomi phone company have it like right there on their website

38:28.720 --> 38:30.640
It's pretty much the same kind of thing

38:30.640 --> 38:36.160
But that yeah, that's what you get because they're you know, at least part Chinese company that side

38:36.160 --> 38:38.160
I did try it in a VM and

38:38.560 --> 38:42.720
You have to be you know, because it's Android and it's not a general purpose PC OS

38:42.960 --> 38:46.320
You have to be very specific about the hardware that you give it

38:46.320 --> 38:49.520
You know, it doesn't work on every PC is a general purpose, but yeah

38:49.520 --> 38:52.920
There are drivers missing so you have to be you have to tweak it a little bit in virtual box

38:52.920 --> 38:54.920
for example, but it does boot and

38:56.080 --> 39:01.400
It it's very it's very unlike Android in that it's it's got

39:02.080 --> 39:07.520
Windows for things like settings I went to the settings screen and I was expecting to get smacked in the face with the usual full

39:07.520 --> 39:14.240
Screen and right now settings. Yeah, but no it looked like you know, no more solace or something like that

39:14.240 --> 39:16.760
It looked like a normal modern desktop operating system

39:16.880 --> 39:19.960
And you know, I fiddled around with some of the settings and some of it works

39:19.960 --> 39:21.960
Some of it didn't I went to get a Google Play

39:22.800 --> 39:23.960
APK

39:23.960 --> 39:28.320
Because it doesn't ship with Google Play. It doesn't have Chrome or anything. It's got you know, none of the official apps

39:28.500 --> 39:32.800
So I went to get the Google Play APK and that wouldn't install

39:34.200 --> 39:39.000
In their videos they have the play they do have the place to end Chrome installed, right?

39:39.000 --> 39:40.800
So they put that on it's not on the ISO

39:40.800 --> 39:46.320
Yeah, I did try installing it, but it wouldn't open but I didn't give it a huge amount of time, you know

39:46.320 --> 39:48.520
Yeah, if I may step in here. Yeah

39:49.120 --> 39:56.800
So I installed it and there is in fact a semi-official version with GF's and I created a USB

39:57.360 --> 40:00.360
USB stick out of it and it's running bleeding

40:00.920 --> 40:04.400
How did you where did you find that? Is that not part of the regular loader? I

40:04.400 --> 40:12.160
I logged into the free node remix OS channel, which is semi-official also and so there were some leaking images

40:12.560 --> 40:18.120
But on the official server and there is a version from yesterday that comes with GF's installed

40:18.680 --> 40:20.040
so I

40:20.040 --> 40:25.960
Made an USB stick out of it and used it on an AC Chromebook and I was pretty successful

40:26.160 --> 40:30.760
So it's bleeding fast. I played Star Wars Angry Birds on it. I was watching live TV

40:30.760 --> 40:36.320
Yeah, so so it's there is some potential in this really there is some potential

40:36.760 --> 40:42.760
Yeah, there are there are definitely some Android apps. I wouldn't mind having on my on my desktop

40:43.880 --> 40:47.440
And you know, you've got you've got some other nice serious applications. So

40:48.400 --> 40:51.680
Before we go on they were at CES and here's a there's also it

40:51.680 --> 40:56.640
So there's a hardware component to this as well and a little more information about the project, too

40:57.200 --> 40:58.840
Hello everybody

40:58.840 --> 41:05.840
Welcome to the remix OS CES 2016 booth for all the people who couldn't make it but really wanted to be here

41:05.840 --> 41:07.840
I wanted to give you guys

41:07.880 --> 41:11.840
Inside look to what our booth looks like and what we're doing at our booth

41:11.840 --> 41:15.600
Okay, and they actually when you watch this video, they actually seem like kind of neat people

41:16.440 --> 41:22.040
They can think I'm passionate. Yeah about this. So here we are at CES International 2016

41:22.040 --> 41:27.320
It's a remix OS booth again, and we've got a few of our team members right now

41:27.320 --> 41:30.560
Showing off our product lines as you can see

41:30.560 --> 41:36.480
This is the end of the day here at CES, but it's still relatively busy at our booth. So let's take a look

41:39.640 --> 41:41.640
Yeah, I don't mind him

41:42.080 --> 41:44.960
Jeff behind the counter right now. He's actually showing off

41:45.560 --> 41:50.680
This is the mini which a lot of you already have you know and love if you don't love it

41:50.680 --> 41:52.680
right us, but that's that support and

41:52.680 --> 41:57.840
This is the mini in action right here on this screen. We've been showing it off at the booth

41:57.840 --> 42:02.680
It's been getting really well reception here at the show if you move on down the line

42:02.680 --> 42:09.440
This is Owen works with us on PO and what you see here is a very exciting project

42:09.440 --> 42:12.040
Let's keep going down and I'm going to show you this project right here

42:12.040 --> 42:21.080
So here at the show one of the biggest announcements we're making is this this is the remix

42:23.160 --> 42:28.980
I like that there. I like that. They're also just being really upfront. We're working with Android x86 to do this

42:28.980 --> 42:32.200
I think that's kind of cool. What it is is we've worked in

42:32.880 --> 42:35.360
collaboration with the Android x86 team

42:35.360 --> 42:43.040
Put remakes OS on top of Android x86 and allows remakes OS to boot from any Intel or AMD

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
chip PC

42:46.240 --> 42:47.520
Tower

42:47.520 --> 42:53.360
Laptops and about 60% of them out in the market or out in the world will work with this

42:54.080 --> 42:56.080
ISO file so

42:56.080 --> 42:58.120
And so it's a 40%

42:58.120 --> 43:02.520
It's a pretty that's a pretty you basically have to have you know let some legacy USB support and things like that

43:02.520 --> 43:06.880
But I don't know. I think it's it's interesting that you law obviously leaves me a little concerned

43:06.880 --> 43:14.280
But if I could install G apps or gaps on this thing and I could have chrome and I could have Netflix and Plex

43:15.280 --> 43:16.880
Might be kind of compelling

43:16.880 --> 43:22.800
So when it comes to chrome chrome is working without problems so at least with the USB stick

43:22.800 --> 43:24.800
And it's easy to create one you just

43:25.440 --> 43:31.520
Download unit boot in from the repos and then you can create your stick. You don't even lose your data on your stick

43:31.520 --> 43:33.640
It's just some persistent image files

43:33.640 --> 43:38.760
So you get a system image a data image and so on and they're persistent image for your data

43:39.080 --> 43:45.640
So the rest of the data that you have still have on the USB this the old daughter is stays on the disk

43:46.080 --> 43:50.840
So it's really cool. Hope you. What do you think about the fact that they're they're essentially promising convergence

43:50.840 --> 43:56.280
They're promising a desktop operating system that works with touch or the keyboard and they're saying whichever one you want to use

43:56.280 --> 43:58.600
Do you think it's possible to deliver it in this type of?

43:58.600 --> 44:02.720
It'll windowed system. Yeah, you know, it'll be

44:03.680 --> 44:08.160
As you'd expect Android to be on a on a desktop, you know with some modifications

44:08.160 --> 44:11.160
I think one of the problems they'll be is they're constantly chasing

44:11.760 --> 44:18.320
Google because you know IO has just been announced is going to be in May and they'll be talking about the next version of Android

44:18.320 --> 44:21.720
And so x8 Android x86 is always a little way behind

44:21.720 --> 44:27.520
Upstream and so they're constantly chasing Android and part of that means that they've got to keep forward porting all of their work

44:27.840 --> 44:33.280
So if they can keep that momentum going and they have enough contributors to

44:33.600 --> 44:39.080
Keep their stuff working then. Yeah, they could they could end up having an interesting converged device

44:39.080 --> 44:41.480
There's a lot of Android games. I mean

44:42.040 --> 44:46.280
You know right there this could be an interesting desktop for some people. I don't know

44:46.280 --> 44:48.280
Yeah, imagine imagine putting that on a desktop

44:48.280 --> 44:56.040
Yeah, yeah, and imagine doing it maybe at a school, right where you don't want to necessarily be cooked up to Google apps and Chrome

44:56.680 --> 45:01.680
But you want to take advantage of all the development and applications and the fact that a lot of people you're hiring are gonna know

45:01.680 --> 45:07.680
How to write Android apps. I think they're gonna have to be a little bit careful. I mean you can see why they've not

45:08.240 --> 45:09.760
Put a public

45:09.760 --> 45:14.200
URL up there with all the Google apps in there, but you know giving it away on IRC

45:14.200 --> 45:19.520
And you know done it kind of under the table kind of thing so that you know Google aren't gonna come after them

45:19.520 --> 45:23.880
Which you know if they if they started doing that kind of publicly then Google would come after them

45:23.880 --> 45:26.680
And that's something they've got to worry about they've got to have a you know

45:26.680 --> 45:32.200
Or they build a relationship with Google and start doing it properly rather than you know

45:32.920 --> 45:37.320
Based off of a OSP right? Yeah, that'd be a big indicator. See what happens, huh? Yeah

45:37.320 --> 45:40.680
And hopefully they don't go the way a sign engine mod and start integrating with Google

45:40.680 --> 45:47.000
Yeah, and hopefully they don't go the way a sign engine mod and start integrating Microsoft through all the OS like that's been happening lately

45:48.440 --> 45:53.240
Cortana and like you can now you can you can get Microsoft services. It's just all over

45:53.240 --> 45:57.960
It's just really great. They give a shot. They give a shout out to Ubuntu on there on their page, too

45:58.600 --> 46:02.640
So anyways if you're out there tried remix OS let us know what you think Linux action showed at reddit.com

46:02.840 --> 46:07.120
Anybody else in the mumble room and trying it or have any other thoughts they want to share about remix OS

46:08.200 --> 46:09.800
remix

46:09.800 --> 46:14.100
Remix OS. No, I did happen to just notice that they're already on

46:14.680 --> 46:16.680
2.0 on the latest ones. Oh

46:17.280 --> 46:23.960
Oh 2.0. Yeah, and at a booth at CES that suggests some funding. Don't you think it's a serious project?

46:23.960 --> 46:29.000
Yeah, that's not a cheap thing pull off. Yeah, so that's and they're also touting the performance

46:29.000 --> 46:31.960
They say we beat we've benchmarked remix OS performance using remix OS

46:32.360 --> 46:37.160
For PCs against some of the best Android hardware in the biz and quite honestly nothing comes close

46:37.160 --> 46:40.160
So they're running they show this benchmark here. This is so funny

46:40.360 --> 46:44.680
This they show this benchmark here of remix OS for the PC running on an i7

46:45.320 --> 46:50.840
4790 quad core up against a galaxy 5 note and a galaxy s6 and it just

46:51.440 --> 46:56.060
It is just like it's not even in the same dimension. It's so much. I 7 is so much faster

46:56.060 --> 47:00.080
Well, yeah, you think I guess the point is you could run your Android apps on a really fast machine

47:00.080 --> 47:04.820
That would be kind of interesting. Yeah, but yeah, I could see installing this for like

47:04.820 --> 47:09.540
a grandparent or something if they you know, they're already familiar maybe with Android on a tablet

47:09.540 --> 47:12.280
Oh, I see the Internet is already beginning to gripe about the EULA

47:12.280 --> 47:16.100
So the issues about the EULA have yeah, look at that, you know

47:16.100 --> 47:19.140
I did see the EULA come up first thing when I when I loaded it

47:21.180 --> 47:24.200
Harming national honor and interest national honor boy

47:24.200 --> 47:29.220
That's will be played back to you in a Chinese court in like three years Chris. That is a loose definition this day

47:29.220 --> 47:36.760
Yeah, well, what do they do about security updates? I don't know. That's a very good thing about Android

47:37.600 --> 47:44.560
On your Nexus devices getting a regular cadence of security updates a week. I mean obviously this is an alpha

47:44.560 --> 47:48.560
So it's completely unsupported and there will be no security updates, which is fair enough as you'd expect

47:49.080 --> 47:54.000
But I'd be interested to know what the future holds and what their plans are for delivering

47:54.000 --> 48:02.000
Delivering updates to all those, you know PC users, right? Yes, but it sounds like they have the operating system fairly separated out from user

48:02.000 --> 48:06.840
Data and so then they maybe they have something in mind that will be fairly manageable

48:07.440 --> 48:11.640
They don't know. Yeah, I have to wait and see you know, so here we are

48:11.640 --> 48:14.240
We're towards the end of the show when we were towards the end of the second

48:14.840 --> 48:20.040
Vertex IPA and I gotta say I mean, I'm glad you brought it, but I'm not loving the aftertaste

48:20.040 --> 48:23.560
Either that's kind of disappointed. It's a little it's a little dank of my mouth

48:23.560 --> 48:29.320
Yeah, right now. I feel like I'm gonna need a couple of cups of a couple glasses of water after this would not buy again

48:29.320 --> 48:33.720
Yeah, that's too bad. I'd like to like the bot. I mean the can is yeah

48:33.720 --> 48:37.000
It's got a good design on there. The dude's got a flag. He's got a nice hat. I like that

48:37.640 --> 48:40.800
Very nice seemed like it was made with care. Yeah. Yeah

48:41.880 --> 48:43.720
6.3 percent, huh?

48:43.720 --> 48:45.480
Where did you pick this up?

48:45.480 --> 48:50.520
Hagan, okay. Well, there you go. You know, Hagan's got a good selection. It was a good try. It was a good solid try

48:50.520 --> 48:54.800
I mean, I'm better next week. I would I would also pick that one if I can't I don't think you can really be blamed

48:54.800 --> 48:56.920
Okay, yeah. Thank you. All right

48:56.920 --> 49:02.320
well, so we have an interesting thread that West found this week is like I think we got to talk about this on the show and

49:03.000 --> 49:06.960
I answer kind of agree and I wonder if I want to challenge the premise a little bit too

49:06.960 --> 49:15.000
But before we get to that good talk about digital ocean do the big do and use the promo code do unplugged all one word

49:15.000 --> 49:16.160
lowercase

49:16.160 --> 49:18.160
Guess what ten dollar credit? Whoa?

49:18.960 --> 49:24.200
Linux rigs up in the cloud y'all on-demand less than 55 seconds

49:25.200 --> 49:32.160
$5 a month you get 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one CPU and a terabyte of transfer a

49:32.320 --> 49:35.920
Terabyte of transfer over digital ocean comm and if you use the promo code do unplugged

49:37.120 --> 49:42.400
$10 credit you can try that $5 rig two months for free and they've got data center locations in New York, San Francisco

49:42.400 --> 49:47.120
Singapore Amsterdam London Germany and children with Alan Jude up in Toronto

49:47.120 --> 49:50.280
Hey, hey, yeah, yeah, I think he just stops in there from time to time

49:50.720 --> 49:54.280
Yeah, I don't know for sure, but really what I like about digital ocean

49:55.240 --> 49:57.680
Well, I mean, I don't know why nobody else can figure this out

49:57.680 --> 50:03.400
But boy his digital ocean got just a huge head start on everybody so yeah, they've got SSDs. That's brilliant

50:03.400 --> 50:06.180
They would just you know they got in on that super early before any other

50:06.520 --> 50:10.240
Provider out there was willing to spend the money, so they totally leveraged that

50:10.240 --> 50:16.560
I think they were brilliant in the fact that they jumped on KVM and started building their product around KVM way before other vendors

50:16.560 --> 50:21.640
Were willing to consider KVM now. They're just introducing KVM as a feature right, but they're struggling

50:21.640 --> 50:27.320
They're struggling to keep up, and then they brought it all together with the incredible interface over digital ocean

50:27.320 --> 50:29.880
It's very simple very intuitive and very powerful

50:29.880 --> 50:34.760
It lets you destroy machines deploy machines one-click application deployments of an entire stacks

50:34.760 --> 50:42.120
Or you know you want like you want everything from Ubuntu Apache and a blogging platform in a single click boom

50:42.120 --> 50:45.560
It all gets deployed for you, or maybe you just want the base operating system

50:45.560 --> 50:52.080
They've got a bunch of great distributions you get to choose from Ubuntu CentOS Debian Fedora core OS and even free BSD

50:52.560 --> 50:54.560
one-click applications you can deploy

50:55.280 --> 50:57.120
fantastic tutorials and

50:57.120 --> 51:01.680
Incredible prices go to digital ocean comm and use the promo code do unplugged

51:01.680 --> 51:07.880
And see why it's been my Linux infrastructure on-demand whenever I need it. I mean really at five dollars a month

51:08.200 --> 51:12.680
There's almost nothing. I won't spin up on a digital ocean droplet, so I got an idea Chris

51:12.680 --> 51:18.000
Yeah, so sometimes. I just don't have a great route somewhere. You know Comcast. It's everyone's on Comcast

51:18.000 --> 51:21.680
Oh, and I get frustrated. Maybe I'm talking to Europe the worst you know maybe

51:22.440 --> 51:25.360
Last number last Tuesday's you're having all kinds of issues all kinds of issues

51:25.360 --> 51:30.000
Yes, right, but so what I do when I'm thinking maybe a script with their api's

51:30.000 --> 51:34.360
There's a need you spin up a DO droplet. Whatever is closest to you. I don't you could probably figure that

51:34.360 --> 51:39.360
I do the same friend myself. Yeah, and then SSH. Did you know you can spin up a tunnel interface?

51:39.360 --> 51:43.840
Oh, yeah, and have SSH provide IP transit. Yeah, so you just you spin that right?

51:43.840 --> 51:48.280
Oh, yeah, and then BAM you route everything through your have done that make a new. Oh, yeah

51:48.280 --> 51:53.920
I have I have legitimately done that when we've had Comcast issues. Yeah, so what I'm just saying

51:53.920 --> 51:57.720
There's other things in like Amsterdam that you might be in London

51:57.720 --> 52:00.120
I'm saying there might be a reason why you want to be located in London

52:00.120 --> 52:00.920
I'm not saying what it is

52:00.920 --> 52:05.600
But or if you're in London and all of a sudden it'd be really useful to be located in New York or Singapore or?

52:05.840 --> 52:10.840
Or Toronto or maybe San Francisco digital ocean makes it that easy it does for five dollars a month

52:10.840 --> 52:14.160
And if you use the promo code do unplug to get it two months for free so a big

52:14.160 --> 52:18.080
Thank you digital ocean for sponsoring the Linux unplug program you guys are the rock source

52:18.920 --> 52:20.240
All right

52:20.240 --> 52:26.560
So what do you do when you keep getting the geek squad treatment? He says I'm an IT manager for a website

52:26.560 --> 52:30.760
I manage developers and perform a lot of hands-on activities to work. I'm not really a hardware tech anymore

52:30.760 --> 52:38.520
However friends and family rarely make the decision or I'm sorry distinction when their tablet or their laptop or their desktop is broken

52:38.520 --> 52:44.480
And they often ask me for help obviously without any compensation as a matter of gentlemanly discourse

52:44.480 --> 52:49.200
I never ask for technical professional help for many of my friends or family if I do which isn't often

52:49.200 --> 52:53.480
I pay in exchange for the favor immediately or simply ask for instructions

52:53.480 --> 52:56.720
I also don't intrude on their personal time or expect anything inside a schedule

52:57.080 --> 53:00.980
Call these my I call these my golden rules of personal professional exchange

53:01.200 --> 53:06.140
But for some time now certain family members and close friends have mistakenly begun to treat me like the geek squad

53:06.320 --> 53:11.040
Except without pain and certainly just as insistent and impolite as one of their customers

53:11.040 --> 53:15.280
I don't mind helping and I don't understand their frustration and I and I understand their frustration

53:16.040 --> 53:21.040
But it started to chat me a little bit people get snippy when I don't feel like helping and they rely on me during

53:21.040 --> 53:26.960
outside hours quote-unquote which cuts into my personal time and weirdly enough blame me for their troubles as

53:27.160 --> 53:34.240
If I'm the one getting their pet hair into their desktop overheating their altar book while gaming from the comfort of their comforter or

53:34.560 --> 53:38.000
clicking pop-ups I shouldn't from an insurance browser from an insecure browser or

53:38.680 --> 53:44.400
I'm the one who invited they're breaking breaking out their phone and breaking their gorilla glass do I seem better

53:44.400 --> 53:50.640
Maybe anyways here's the question has anyone found a polite quick sensitive way to immediately shut down friends and family

53:50.640 --> 53:56.920
When they ask you to be the geek squad I have really found a foolproof rejection anti rejection method

53:58.720 --> 54:00.720
And I was wondering when we look at this

54:01.280 --> 54:06.560
What our mumble room and what West thinks because a lot of us probably get called in as the technical support?

54:06.560 --> 54:08.720
I imagine in this audience. I know I certainly do

54:09.480 --> 54:13.480
In fact you know and I because I know my mom's not gonna listen to this

54:13.480 --> 54:18.860
I just call her out so this last Sunday after the Linux action show okay

54:18.860 --> 54:23.040
Oh, I should back up even further so about a week ago. My mom messages me

54:23.040 --> 54:28.960
She says who do you use for hosting and I respond digital ocean right right and I'm like what is my mom care, right?

54:29.880 --> 54:37.560
And then like the next day my mom replies to me. Oh, I see they support HTML, and I'm like oh my god

54:38.120 --> 54:43.800
Yeah, mom. They support HTML after you deploy the Linux server you set up the Apache web server and then

54:43.800 --> 54:49.280
You can like or you like to the one click Apple app deployment, but like might mean open mom's not

54:49.280 --> 54:52.800
No, I'm not following exactly what needs to happen here, and so I'm like mom

54:52.800 --> 54:57.080
I'm not sure so sure you understand, so then she messages me like a couple of days ago

54:57.120 --> 54:59.720
Well, I would like to see you this weekend when can we can we get together?

54:59.840 --> 55:00.760
And I tell her well

55:00.760 --> 55:03.680
I have a little bit of time after I'm done with the Linux action show on Sunday

55:03.680 --> 55:07.720
But you know really like I just got done with the show what I would like to do is relax

55:07.720 --> 55:12.680
I would like your little bit of weekend. Yeah, like I got like a couple hours left on this Sunday

55:12.680 --> 55:15.040
There's a couch over there man. That sounds good

55:15.040 --> 55:15.520
No

55:15.520 --> 55:19.760
So mom wants to come up and she wants to consult with me on her new business endeavors website

55:19.760 --> 55:23.720
And it doesn't really there's not like a lot of discussion about like how busy I've been

55:23.960 --> 55:29.200
Or the fact that I'm prepping to go to scale trying to get a new running business running my own business

55:29.200 --> 55:30.760
It was my daughter's birthday

55:30.760 --> 55:36.400
It was also an anniversary and then on top of all of that like I'm doing the show this weekend like there was no consideration

55:36.400 --> 55:41.000
There's not really like I don't really have a good way to say sorry mom like I know this is important to you

55:41.000 --> 55:45.040
But I also have a life like I don't really know how to have that have you ever been in a position like that

55:45.360 --> 55:47.440
Yeah, definitely. I mean you know that's

55:48.040 --> 55:50.180
There's a big there's just some users that

55:50.960 --> 55:55.840
They don't understand like because you have the ability that ergo you are you are obligated to help

55:55.840 --> 56:00.160
It's not yeah, it's not placing value on your time and sometimes you just have to tell people that

56:00.840 --> 56:04.840
Marks, do you think it's weird to get into the discussion of monetary exchange for these things?

56:04.840 --> 56:11.240
I'm not sure about monetary exchange when it comes to family, but maybe some sort of like-for-like thing because you know

56:11.240 --> 56:15.840
Say you've got a fat. Yeah, so your sister's a nurse you might ask her to you know

56:15.840 --> 56:20.640
Take a look at your foot when it's if you've got something wrong with it, and you wouldn't well

56:20.640 --> 56:25.800
I mean obviously your your health system is different of course we wouldn't pay for for something like that over here, but

56:26.600 --> 56:28.600
you know why if

56:29.320 --> 56:33.160
If you've got if you've got a family member who has a profession and you'd you'd be

56:33.160 --> 56:38.680
Expect them or not necessarily expect them ask them to help you out with something based on their knowledge, then yeah sure

56:38.680 --> 56:42.480
Maybe you doing tech support for them for free isn't a big deal

56:43.000 --> 56:48.440
Here is my current excuse and this is why I couldn't get out of the one with my mom because I got a go-to

56:48.440 --> 56:50.440
that's pretty solid and

56:50.840 --> 56:52.960
Because if they are willing to take me up on it

56:52.960 --> 56:57.200
I'm willing to commit and my go-to is you know I switched away from Linux

56:57.200 --> 57:03.880
After Windows XP, and I don't really know Windows anymore. I'm a Linux user and so if you want to switch to Linux

57:03.880 --> 57:07.240
I can help you with that and if they do it if they buy it. I'm like all right. I'll commit to that

57:07.240 --> 57:12.320
Yeah, I like I don't mind, but when it comes to server hosting stuff like what what do I say? Yeah? Well?

57:13.120 --> 57:18.560
Sorry mom. I used to support ground there like it's it's not like you give her some tips on server administration

57:18.560 --> 57:24.360
Yeah, no now you're administering her server. Yeah, yeah, yeah, poppy everybody in your family must know you work for a technology company

57:24.360 --> 57:28.160
Yeah, poppy everybody in your family must know you work for a technology company you must get this

57:28.840 --> 57:35.480
Yeah, so there's a couple of things like my brother is completely non-technical. He's a hairdresser. I can't cut my own hair

57:35.480 --> 57:37.680
He cuts my hair. I saw his computers out

57:37.680 --> 57:42.860
So is that there's a as Mark said if there's someone in your family who can do something so that that seems reasonable to me

57:44.400 --> 57:46.400
however I I

57:46.760 --> 57:52.080
Can't say no to my mom right and I couldn't say no to my mother-in-law in fact

57:52.080 --> 57:57.080
Well, you've been on air my mother-in-law has has pinned me on Facebook and said hey

57:57.080 --> 58:00.620
That new hard drive is arrived for me to do time machine backups on my Mac

58:01.480 --> 58:05.660
But the box says it needs formatting for a Mac, and I'm my reply was yeah

58:05.660 --> 58:06.240
Well, that's fine

58:06.240 --> 58:11.320
Do you want me to help because she's my mother-in-law and she will cook me roast dinners. There is that?

58:12.160 --> 58:18.060
That is an exchange. I'm willing to go down with and the flipside and also point out. She is your mom dude

58:18.060 --> 58:23.000
No, I'm helping her. I'm helping her, but I'm telling you like I do I feel like I get roped into this stuff now

58:23.000 --> 58:26.680
The mom one is a difficult one. Yes, but you must have this with the family too, right?

58:26.680 --> 58:30.080
I mean they everybody must be aware of what you do. They must be where your technical guy

58:31.440 --> 58:33.280
yeah, and

58:33.280 --> 58:39.320
Ubuntu Marte was the solution to that problem so like yourself you get these questions about you know

58:40.280 --> 58:46.320
Well some of the so on my wife's side of the family all of all of those got migrated to Ubuntu

58:46.320 --> 58:47.600
versus

58:47.600 --> 58:51.280
X so a long time ago and on my side of the family

58:51.280 --> 58:55.320
They've been a little bit more resistance, and I played the same card. Oh well

58:55.320 --> 59:00.160
You know I haven't used Windows for years. You know I stopped using Linux that Windows a long long time ago

59:00.160 --> 59:03.320
I really don't know how it works and then

59:04.560 --> 59:07.880
On my wife's side of the family they were still running 10-0 for

59:08.960 --> 59:11.680
that was getting quite out of date and

59:11.680 --> 59:18.360
We tried some of things and then Ubuntu Marte sort of got created to sort of support them so now

59:19.080 --> 59:25.900
My solution to this problem is basically you spend 20 years using and learning Linux you then create a Linux distribution

59:26.040 --> 59:29.720
You then form a hardware partnership with a local hardware company

59:30.360 --> 59:34.800
When your family say they need help you say go to this website buy this computer

59:34.800 --> 59:37.600
And it comes pre-installed and I never have to do anything

59:37.600 --> 59:44.560
Unfortunately the length you really have to go to yeah, and it sounds it sounds sarcastic

59:44.560 --> 59:49.400
But it's true because three of my family have now bought computers from Entroware and I've had them

59:49.840 --> 59:57.360
Shipped pre-installed with Ubuntu Marte, and I haven't had to be involved go round there. It just works, so it's paid off

59:57.720 --> 59:59.720
Yeah

59:59.720 --> 01:00:05.760
And didn't you also buy and set up routers for all of your family I did yes, yeah, that's a good move

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:10.840
That is a good move. That is a flash them all with gargoyle. Yeah, I think that's I think that's something

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.320
I'm going to be doing to

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:14.320
the drawback to this approach is

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:19.920
Every month there are 10,000 other people who I don't know on the internet that are now all demanding

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:24.720
There is that problem, but you could think of them as extended family testers. They're testing

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:29.180
They're a new group of friends. I didn't have a year ago, so it's all good

01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:34.160
Yeah, I had like I think I mentioned a few weeks ago. I had a successful switch over the holidays

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:40.480
I was out. I went somewhere. I didn't even have an internet connection when I did it and I had an Ubuntu Marte

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:44.280
This is bragging rights. No internet. No internet connection

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:48.320
And I had I had I already had a flash to a thumb drive because I actually used my laptop bag to pack my clothes

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:51.040
And if I took the laptop out and I put my clothes in there

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:54.880
But I I left my front thing that has all my thumb drives loaded cuz like I'm not gonna unload all that crap

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:58.140
No, and that's always like I got there the guy was having problems with Windows 8 one

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:01.920
He was thinking about getting a Mac and it's like try this and so

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:04.680
Da-da-da-da. Mm-hmm. It worked out pretty good. It was a good success

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:11.920
It was like hey, I had a I had a Linux switch story over the holidays. That's amazing. Yeah, so I agree there is

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:17.800
two solutions that I feel pretty good about when it's your mom or your mother-in-law or

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:22.400
Or if you give them a switch to Linux, those are the conditions in which you should support them

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:25.320
I think it but here's the thing remember we can also be ambassadors

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:32.000
We can be ambassadors to these people in times of need. So if you have the emotional capacity, I encourage you to the option

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.560
Yeah, I mean it's all on you got to check with yourself

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:37.800
You got an ABC always be checking before you commit

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:42.440
But I'm just saying if you can you could be an ambassador to the open-source world

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:50.080
It's an opportunity to switch or at least get them started on maybe moving from Outlook to Thunderbird or from Internet Explorer to Firefox

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:51.600
Right. There's so many different ways

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:56.080
You can sometimes solve problems like if they're having a malware issue on their Windows box get them going with Firefox

01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:00.160
And that gets them started on the path and then down the road the switch is a lot easier

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:02.000
I also have to say the article do you touch on this?

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:08.840
But if you get some sort of beverage or delicious food item in exchange that sometimes can work out as well. Yeah

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:14.160
and a bit like you've just said the the other good one is I

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:21.480
think the non-technical people in the family are becoming more aware of the

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:24.940
security implications of running older Windows

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:27.160
operating systems

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:32.660
So what I've started doing is saying here's a USB stick that boots Linux

01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:36.680
When you need to do your online banking or your online shopping

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:38.700
use this

01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:44.920
Because it's secure and it will forget everything that you've just done when you unplug

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:48.300
Ah, so it's like Linux on training wheels because you're just doing it for a little bit

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:54.760
You're just using it for some web browsing stuff and it's for your important stuff to be secure

01:02:54.760 --> 01:03:00.800
Yeah, yeah, and and that sort of makes them think oh, you know, this is just like any other computer, right?

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:06.200
This isn't complicated. This isn't daunting and it's just a little sort of you know taster

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:10.720
That's actually really smart because then later on when they want to move on you'd be like, you know

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:14.880
That operating system you've been used for all your really important stuff. Why don't you choose that all the time, right?

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:18.640
And it's like oh, well, yeah, I trust that. Yeah, I like it. Oh

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:25.080
That is some that is some like level two like psychological switcher stuff right there. I like it

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:27.760
Yeah

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:32.640
Pocket Casey in the chat room asked if I when I have time what I love to he'd love to see a little coverage of the

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:38.400
Tink talk that would be really that would be very interesting. So pocket Casey if you could tweet me the day of that talk

01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:41.920
You could be the ambassador of that talk if you want and remind me while I'm there

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:45.480
I'll try to do it, but tell ask me now. There's no way I can remember but I would like to see that one

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:49.960
Yeah, I would as well because I didn't even hear about tink until West came along start talking

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:56.340
Linux action show dot reddit dot com. That's the subreddit you go to to submit content to this show or feedback next week

01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:01.340
Because of scale no will be sitting in for me. So it'll be West and Noah in the mumble room

01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:04.660
yeah, yeah, that should be a good time and I

01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:10.100
He'll you guys maybe might want to get the ball rolling earlier in slack than we normally do. We're pretty quick now

01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:13.980
We've got a down. That's true. We got it down. But you know, no that guy's new that guy

01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:17.620
He doesn't you know, so you got to watch out for him. So go check it out

01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:19.900
Thank you very much for being here everybody

01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:27.700
We do the Linux unplugged show live on Tuesdays over at jblive.tv at 2 p.m. Is that right or 1 p.m. Yeah

01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:34.060
Okay. Hmm seems really the day with you seems pretty wet, huh? You know what if I got confused I would just

01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:38.020
If I got confused, I would just go to Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar

01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:40.860
That's what I would do that's her that would converge my local time zone

01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:43.900
You could show you could show up live hang out in our virtual log hang on our chatter

01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:46.540
But if you can't just download it, we've got RSS feeds

01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:51.120
We appreciate it Linux action show dot reddit dot com Jupiter broadcasting comm slash contact to send us feedback

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:57.560
Thanks so much for tuning in and we'll see you right back here next week. Well, they will

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:23.120
Oh

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:37.600
Well, you see that where's West there hey there worse you see that

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:40.240
Marcus is trying out MB

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:43.880
Yeah, so tell us. So what do you think Mario? So you go with I got you. What do you think marks?

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:47.840
What do you think of the MB? Yeah, it's really good because I've got a

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:50.440
Cody box in my living room

01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:52.440
and I've been

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:54.760
having

01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:57.720
Reasonable success with with managing my library on it

01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:04.320
But I I'd like having all my music on my server and streaming that so I've had them and patchy running on there for a while

01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:10.200
Which is fairly decent, but it only does music and I've got my videos on the server, too

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:14.480
So it's nice to just have one solution. So I thought I'd stick MB on there and give it a go

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:17.000
and I found

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.520
It does the video library really well and since that's coding nicely

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:28.360
It doesn't sync the video library to Cody so nicely for some reason but because it's got the remote control feature

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:30.120
you can just

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:34.400
You just go into the web interface or the app on MB and you say send it to Cody

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:39.940
It's brilliant using the the MB plug-in at all for Cody

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:46.120
Yeah, so that's what I think you you put the MB plug-in in and that's what sinks your mute your video library

01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:52.080
I think and it also means that then your other MB apps will recognize it as somewhere that you can send media

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:56.660
It's worked very well my but you're saying the music part does not work as well

01:06:57.220 --> 01:07:03.740
Well, it works, but only if you use another app to like select the playlist or the music

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:10.800
So it doesn't sync the music library to Cody's music library for some reason. Where's where's either I am

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:13.920
Can you hear me? Where's is Chris recording yet? Yes

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:19.160
Yeah, yeah. Okay. Why why what's wrong? I've got a question for you Chris. Yeah, what's that?

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:22.400
15 arrived yet

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:29.600
No, that is you know what you know what I don't I don't even know what to say because now I'm going on this trip

01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:34.920
And I'm I'm I am literally in the position of like I'm like which one of the which one of the machines can I?

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:40.640
Sacrifice in the studio and not disrupt the shows that will be going next week because the thing is doing a job

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:45.080
What if I need to do production from the road like what if I need to do some production from the road?

01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:49.120
Can I do it all my xps 13? I don't think so. I need a larger screen machine

01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:51.880
just oh oh

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:54.160
Oh

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:59.320
Yeah, I would I would I would do anything to have that rig monitor built into the rover

01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:01.440
You know what? I would like at this point anything is

01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:04.160
I would just like you know what to be honest with you at this point

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:06.560
I would just like a refund I think and I just need to get something

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:11.520
You should contact them and ask them if they come to scale and maybe they could bring your laptop along yeah

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:13.520
I should I wonder if they will be a scale

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:21.280
Wonder hmm. You should drive the rover over to their office, and then just camp outside until he gives you empty empty your black tank in there

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:25.040
Wow I

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:28.600
Empty my tank in your direction sir

01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:32.880
Yikes yikes, so you know the thing is is

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:40.160
I've driven a gas vehicle my entire life, and this thing runs on top of basically a diesel chassis, right?

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:41.700
It's a it is a diesel it is more

01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:47.520
It's more of a diesel truck than it is anything else so it's got like air brakes and air suspension

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:50.200
and it has like glow plugs and

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:55.720
Like all the add a DF and a DF tank to help reduce the diesel emissions

01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:59.320
And so it's got like all this stuff that I have to learn how to operate

01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:03.520
Scaling up here plus. It's got plus. It's got a built-in generator with an auto start system

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:06.080
So I can set conditions for when the generator automatically kicks in

01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:12.480
But like I gotta learn how to manage all of these things in like well tomorrow morning basically

01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:17.240
And I don't have a great memory, so I think what it really means is as Chris because you should record it

01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:21.440
I'm gonna be good. Yes exactly. That's why I probably will record, and I'm gonna be googling while on the road

01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:28.480
Oh the good news is a diesel is quite a bit cheaper than gasoline fuel right now, so

01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:33.800
That's that's the good news. Yeah, yeah, that's great, and it's more more efficient as well

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:38.940
Yeah, and they might look at you a little funny if you show up with a GoPro on a bicycle helmet though

01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:41.960
Yeah, well it is a lot to learn before the trip

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:45.980
But I had to learn everything about the rover before the last trip, and I managed to pull that off

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:49.520
So I got I am I'm up for the challenge

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:52.880
I think but it is a lot it is a lot to when I think about it

01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:55.320
It is a lot to go through and then maybe none of it happens

01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:59.960
And then maybe I just end up taking the truck and the and the rover and then they it's it's it's whatever

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.960
It's no big deal

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:08.040
Yeah, I found it interesting listening to you talking about the rover and

01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:10.560
then

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:18.160
Sort of ending up living in the rover and then enjoying that space yeah, and I can identify with this because

01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:23.360
My wife's parents have got a barge, and I absolutely love living on the barge

01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:29.520
This is a narrowboat that goes up and down the canals in the UK so very thin and long

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:32.520
so not much space, but I kind of like the

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:38.940
Efficiency of living that you have to adopt when you're living in and you know small space like that

01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:42.680
So what is it about living in the RV that that you find?

01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:50.400
Yeah, it's pretty it's definitely an aspect of that so like there's no reason for me to go to a furniture store because I'm not

01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:56.680
Gonna be able to buy anything in that furnished furniture store and bring it home and that it's sort of freeing like when we have

01:10:56.680 --> 01:11:01.420
a really big mess to clean up it takes 10 15 minutes and the entire space is

01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:04.200
Immaculate and it's so nice

01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:08.720
So there is a lot less need of things and there's a lot less

01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:16.040
like maintenance and maintaining that a big place comes with you know a big place gets cluttered up

01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:19.800
There's stuff all over all of the wherever there's counter space or or wherever

01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:23.400
There's a flat surface stuff ends up getting stacked on top of it

01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:28.280
and then they have they have yards that have to be maintained, and I don't have time or energy for that and

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:34.380
I also hate my neighbors like I constantly I look for things like there's a new guy

01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:38.820
There's a new guy who he's a renter that lives over in the house across over there

01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:41.340
Hey, and he's out there, and he's smoking all the time when I'm outside

01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:42.860
So you know I'm here

01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:44.940
I am loading unloading stuff from the back of my truck

01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:50.600
You know grunting and huffing and puffing and this guy's just sitting out there for like 20 minutes watching me like a 20 minute smoke

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:52.820
Break just sitting there staring at me the whole time and then one

01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:58.780
And then like two weeks into it. I get out of my truck, and I lock it and I'm walking and he says hey

01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:01.340
Your lights are on

01:12:01.340 --> 01:12:06.460
Now I have been doing this for two weeks since this guy's moved in and he's the lights have always

01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:11.100
Automatically turned themselves off they have since the first time he's seen me show up for two weeks in a row

01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:15.840
The lights automatically turned themselves off and then two weeks into he's like hey your lights

01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:20.460
And like and I'm like I just stopped there. I'm like well. Yeah, they turn

01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:23.940
And it's not even like I'm like some famous in 2012

01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:27.260
It's not some fancy vehicle right the lights just turned themselves off so anyways I

01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:31.960
I developed Hicks about like and then I could tell you about these guys, so we tell you about these guys right

01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:35.380
These guys right here. They're coming and going at the same time

01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:38.900
I am all the time now obviously how long ago, and I tell you about this no, it's true

01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:41.780
It's I've observed the same. I had I've complained about it

01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:47.100
I've even sent you pictures of them coming and going when I'm coming and going why are they always coming to go when I'm coming?

01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:53.020
And going I come and go weird times. I'm a podcaster and yet they're coming and going at weird times. It's suspicious

01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:57.420
Maybe they have it's almost like you listen to the live stream, and then they're coming and going when I'm coming and going

01:12:58.060 --> 01:13:00.940
Great way to spy on your neighbor. Oh well. He just has this life

01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:07.120
Yeah, so and then and then and then this is another one where I think maybe I am I have some sort of condition

01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:09.420
I'm not very good at

01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:14.860
So that there's the neighbor thing so I like to be able to I like the ability to pick up and move so there might

01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:18.860
Be some sort of condition there where I just start to develop ticks about the people you know what it is is

01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:23.020
I observe a lot of patterns in people and then when they when they have bad patterns

01:13:23.020 --> 01:13:27.860
I can't help but notice them and then they drive me crazy because then like I have to build the narrative around why they have

01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:29.860
Such an awful pattern in their life

01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:34.940
Anyways, so it's nice to be able to pick up and move so that's one you know plus for the for the mobile lifestyle

01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:42.260
You know the other thing is is I really I really put a lot of my time and energy into the network like

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:47.940
So much so that I'm negligent to other aspects of my life not and it doesn't really matter how important it is

01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:49.740
It's like could be it could be a health issue

01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:53.420
It could be taking care of personal insurance doesn't really matter what it is

01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:55.940
I'm just not very good at addressing it and along with that

01:13:56.300 --> 01:14:01.140
Comes things like all of the crap you have to manage and pay and when I mean manage

01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:04.380
I mean even having to like go into bill pay and set up payments and

01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:11.820
and and send checks to your power company and your water company and your cable company and and the garbage company and all this all

01:14:11.820 --> 01:14:14.340
the all of the different organizations or or

01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:19.220
Utilities that you have to pay when you own a house. They just drive me crazy

01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:23.460
I don't have time to manage that I don't want to bother with any of it and so one of the nice things about where

01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:25.460
I'm staying at is it's

01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:27.140
All just part of the deal

01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:28.740
I pay a flat

01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:33.720
$35 and it's just all part of the deal I can use as much power as I want I use as much water as I

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:36.380
Want the garbage is built in all of its one

01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:42.380
But it's just one $35 charge that automatically goes on my card and that and I don't have to I don't have to mail anybody

01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:47.260
A check nothing. It's just very simple for me to manage and it lets me focus on other things

01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:50.140
So the smaller space lets me not have to focus on

01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:55.740
Maintaining my house and making it look nice and not having to worry about the yard and the smaller space keeps it efficient

01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:57.740
I don't need to buy a lot like

01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:01.880
If I do get this new rig, you know along with that new rig is well

01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:07.740
That's also my couch and my dining room table and my oven and my microwave and my refrigerator

01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:12.980
And so and my king-size bed now all of it will just be part of like I otherwise

01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:17.700
I would have to go out and buy all of those things individually like I don't have any of those things anymore

01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:19.440
So I would have to go buy a couch

01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:23.260
I would have to go buy a dining room table set with chairs, and I would have to go buy

01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:27.380
Recliner chairs, and I would have to go buy the televisions. I don't have any televisions right

01:15:27.380 --> 01:15:32.820
I don't to go buy the televisions and the bedding and all of that stuff it when you when you get a nice

01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:38.380
Rig it just all is nice, and it all just comes with it, and so it not only does it check all those other boxes

01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:44.060
But it also is mobile which is great for me to go do these events and do productions on the road and it has all

01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:47.780
It checks all the boxes as far as things you'd have to buy when you get a house that just come with it

01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:49.780
Don't write it. Yeah, I

01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:52.420
Like it a lot and on top of all of that

01:15:52.580 --> 01:15:59.100
It's pretty damn green because at max it can only pull 50 amps which you're never gonna pull that much and

01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:04.420
And and the average US house is 200 amps so by it uses less power

01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:09.100
It has we uses way less water in fact. We're actually very acutely aware of exactly how much water

01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:11.100
We use every single week. I know in gallons

01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:16.460
When's the last time you knew in gallons exactly how much water use every single week absolutely never right you need to live in

01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:18.460
the UK yeah

01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:22.580
So you know I mean it's it's very like we're and because also it's a smaller space

01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:26.060
We're buying less food. We have less waste we have less things

01:16:26.060 --> 01:16:31.860
We're getting that we're not using so it feels like it's also as a side effect a greener way to live

01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:34.380
Which also gives you a lot more?

01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:37.860
You know when you're not you're not having to go shopping for furniture

01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:41.740
And you're not having to spend so much time tidying and and all that kind of stuff

01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:56.500
It gives you a lot more time to round to us online. I think
