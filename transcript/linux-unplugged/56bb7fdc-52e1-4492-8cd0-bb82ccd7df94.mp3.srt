1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
Brent, you're eating breakfast in the hot tub?

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:03,880
Oh yeah.

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,120
What?

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,040
Okay, I have so many questions about this.

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,080
There's a bit of a story.

6
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,280
Why do we need to clear this up?

7
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,120
I'm curious.

8
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,960
Well, because it's too distracting to do the show.

9
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,440
So you're in a hot tub eating breakfast

10
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,880
with your dad and brother.

11
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,460
And I just, okay, are you dressed?

12
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,560
Are you wearing anything?

13
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,960
Oh, just, yeah, you know, a bathing suit or whatever.

14
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,940
Okay, all right.

15
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,680
So my father is visiting from, you know, Ontario.

16
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,320
He's been here for, I don't know, three months.

17
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,680
He won't leave.

18
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,720
So the one request that he had

19
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,360
was that we get a hot tub for him

20
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,220
so he could watch the mountains in the morning,

21
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,240
which is hilarious.

22
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,660
So anyways, his routine now has either been spend time

23
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,520
in the evening in it or in the morning,

24
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,040
you know, having his breakfast, so.

25
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,880
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

26
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,800
So your dad's eating breakfast in the hot tub

27
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,240
on an on regular basis, on an ongoing regular basis?

28
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,080
Oh yeah.

29
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,960
You know, kids, I'd love to visit,

30
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,040
but I just can't be bothered unless you get a hot tub

31
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,880
and then yeah, okay, I'm there.

32
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,720
You know what?

33
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,220
The only thing grosser than eating breakfast in a bathtub

34
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,240
is eating breakfast in the same bathwater

35
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,480
over and over and over again,

36
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,400
which sounds effectively like what he's doing here.

37
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,240
Oh, interesting.

38
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,280
But now I'm picturing three of you eating breakfast

39
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,480
in this hot tub.

40
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,280
It's just one big bowl of oatmeal, I think.

41
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,420
Yeah, I'm just like, what happens when you drop food?

42
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,560
Like, this is horrible.

43
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,560
Hello friends, and welcome back

44
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,780
to your weekly Linux talk show.

45
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,620
My name is Chris.

46
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,680
My name is Wes.

47
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,920
And my name is Brent.

48
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,220
Hello, gentlemen.

49
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,200
Well, we really screwed up this week.

50
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,360
This is a horrible show.

51
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,840
Don't listen to this week's episode.

52
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,220
I'd probably turn it off right now

53
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,660
because about 10 minutes before we started,

54
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:46,320
we deleted nearly 11, what was it, 10,000 lines?

55
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,160
I don't know.

56
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,000
We basically destroyed our entire show, doc.

57
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,120
Thousands of characters.

58
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,520
And decided to throw the topic out.

59
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,580
We had gathered together today to talk about IPFS.

60
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,440
We spent the week going deep into IPFS,

61
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,480
watching YouTube videos, reading articles,

62
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,680
trying out different applications,

63
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,320
hosting websites, deploying on different machines.

64
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,600
And we decided to throw all of that away

65
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,800
and not do it this week.

66
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,140
We're gonna do it in the future.

67
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,560
But we realized that the topic was deep enough.

68
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,680
It was like asking us to explain HTTP

69
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,600
and distributed network storage in one episode.

70
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,680
And then going into the things that are good about it

71
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,160
and the things that are bad about it,

72
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,920
which there are plenty on both sides.

73
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,800
So we decided to instead to break that off

74
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,080
into its own thing in the future.

75
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,560
We'll give you an update on that soon.

76
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,080
And instead, we just have a ton of stuff

77
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,840
that we wanna cover this week anyways.

78
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,640
We were looking at it and realized we had two shows in one.

79
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,640
And so we decided we just weren't really gonna give you

80
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,840
the best show on IPFS today.

81
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,760
But we can give you a good episode

82
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,240
if we focus on the other stuff.

83
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,160
Hey, that means there's still time to send us feedback.

84
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,040
If you have thoughts on how we should talk about IPFS

85
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,440
or if you got some tips for us.

86
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,920
Yeah, maybe before we get into the remainder

87
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,960
of the Zombie Doc this week,

88
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,480
I wanna mention the Jupiter Broadcasting East Coast Meetup.

89
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,480
I think it's been since like 2014

90
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,320
since we've made it out there.

91
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,360
And it's on, it's happening Saturday, April 9th, 2022

92
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,060
in Raleigh, North Carolina.

93
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,120
We're gonna meet up at a park.

94
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,160
I think it's just outside of Raleigh.

95
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,460
You know, I'm not a location expert,

96
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,840
but you generally, if it's right next to a big city,

97
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,960
you say the big city's name, you know.

98
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,440
But we got the address, 403 Nightdale Station Run.

99
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,280
There you go.

100
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,700
So it's Nightdale, North Carolina.

101
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,540
Who even heard of that?

102
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,360
See, nobody.

103
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,200
Or Kingdale?

104
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,040
What is that, Wes?

105
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,880
Get in there, is that Nightdale?

106
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,320
I can't read, I got bad eyes now, I'm 40.

107
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,320
Either way, you go to meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

108
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,420
I don't even know why you're listening to me.

109
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,800
You're not gonna remember it anyways.

110
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,240
So we have all the details up there.

111
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,360
Yeah, there's a button you can click.

112
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,020
You commit to going right there.

113
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,080
Let us know.

114
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,960
You think it's gonna be a banger, as they say.

115
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,580
Wes Payne's gonna be there.

116
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,280
Everybody knows Wes Payne, right?

117
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,120
Yeah.

118
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,360
Yeah, you take a deep breath with a pause

119
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,800
because he's like, I haven't booked the flight yet.

120
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,680
I have not, but I'm gonna go.

121
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,200
Alex does have a couch for you though.

122
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,020
Oh, that's amazing.

123
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,720
So you can save a little money there.

124
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,240
Brent's gonna be there on one of those couches too.

125
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,640
So Brent'll be there.

126
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,240
And our buddy, Michael Dominic,

127
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,760
from the Kota Radio program's gonna be there.

128
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,240
What?

129
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,320
Yep, yep.

130
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,960
Of course, Alex from Self Hosted will be there.

131
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,800
Of course.

132
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,200
So it's really coming together.

133
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,400
Looks like we're gonna have, so far,

134
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,900
about 50 people have said they're coming

135
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,880
from the community, but I'm starting to suspect

136
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,780
it's gonna be more than that,

137
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,240
since we saw about a month before it kicks off.

138
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,280
So join us in North Carolina on April 9th.

139
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,120
We wanna see you.

140
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,000
And I am trying to mention this ahead of time

141
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,800
because I want you guys to understand

142
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,200
my motivation for kind of mentioning this

143
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,280
every episode for a bit is we have people

144
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,580
who sometimes are a month or two behind.

145
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,280
And so they hear about a meetup that's in their area

146
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,480
a month after it's happened.

147
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,280
So I try to get ahead of it as much as I can

148
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,040
when we can and let you know it's coming.

149
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,840
So now with the standard meetup announcement

150
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,440
out of the way, I wanna start today's episode

151
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,120
by talking about our each individual thoughts

152
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,200
on how to engage with an open source developer

153
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,860
to give them some sort of feedback

154
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,560
or to ask for a bug fix in a project

155
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,780
that you're working on.

156
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:14,120
All three of us have recently had an experience with this.

157
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,280
Wes, I think, really got us thinking about this last week

158
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,280
when he mentioned his experience.

159
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,480
I also recently had an experience asking for something.

160
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,920
I asked for a developer who had created a hosted bot

161
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,840
that runs on his server.

162
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,760
I asked him to dockerize that up

163
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,280
and make a few modifications to make that

164
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,160
possible to self-host.

165
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,680
And it's kind of a big ask, right?

166
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,880
I'm going in there and I'm asking,

167
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,680
hey, I know this isn't really adding a feature

168
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,400
and you have a whole strategy here,

169
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,800
but I'd sure use and trust your application a lot more

170
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,200
if I could self-host it.

171
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,780
Yeah, I have no interest in all the stuff

172
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,920
that you're setting up over there,

173
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,680
but can I just copy it and run it myself?

174
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,280
And I felt a little apprehensive about asking for that.

175
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,640
It felt a little selfish.

176
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,680
Like, you know, who am I, right?

177
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,200
Just asking this developer to divert their time.

178
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,220
So I'll tell you how I handled that

179
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,760
and kind of how I made that happen.

180
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,320
And it worked out for the best.

181
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,440
But I thought maybe we'd start with Brent this week.

182
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,640
And Brent, I wanted to start,

183
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,900
how would you ask an open source developer for a fix?

184
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,400
And then could you tell us about your recent

185
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,000
bug squashing adventures that you've been on

186
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,840
for the last week?

187
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,520
Sure, yeah, I have a little story, actually,

188
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,680
that happened in the Telegram chat this week.

189
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,900
Stay a while and listen.

190
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:28,240
I was really diving into trying to do some bug testing.

191
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,740
Ubuntu, we mentioned, was having their bug testing week.

192
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,580
And I thought, jeez, I've been trying to do that

193
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,860
for a few years and I'm really gonna dive in this week.

194
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,700
Nice.

195
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,560
In the process, I ran into what I feel

196
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,800
is a little speed bump for myself.

197
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,480
I was using Wimpy's lovely Quick EMU

198
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,280
to try to get some VMs up and running

199
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,760
to run these daily images.

200
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,800
And I had an issue with copy and pasting

201
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,880
despite following all of the suggestions

202
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,280
on how to get that up and going.

203
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,600
Copy and pasting between the VM and my native machine.

204
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,000
You had read the docs.

205
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,400
Oh, many times over the last few months.

206
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,980
And so I thought, jeez, maybe this is something

207
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,840
people struggle with in our community.

208
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,200
And I wonder, I'd like to hear what you guys think.

209
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,400
But I feel like I'm not the most technical person

210
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,640
in our community.

211
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,540
And outside of our community, that says a lot

212
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,840
because typically I am.

213
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,840
But I often struggle with, you know, it's a Wimpy's app.

214
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,440
He's a friend of ours.

215
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,740
And so I could just like message him and say,

216
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,500
hey, Wimpy, I'm struggling with this thing.

217
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,240
Can you help me out?

218
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,120
But philosophically, I felt like, well, I don't,

219
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,360
Wimpy probably doesn't want everyone to go and, you know,

220
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,620
DM him about a little problem they're having

221
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,480
with an app that he's worked on.

222
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,080
So I thought, okay, well, how else would I do this

223
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,240
if I didn't know Wimpy?

224
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,060
And so I went into our community and I said,

225
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,920
hey, I know there's people who use this app,

226
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,840
you know, Quick EMU.

227
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,720
It's, you know, a little outside my pay grade

228
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,640
as far as what it's doing under the hood.

229
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,120
And I'm having this really simple issue.

230
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,000
And I wondered if anyone could help me.

231
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,560
And it actually began this really fascinating discussion.

232
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,020
Lucifer in the chat room helped me like wrap some ideas

233
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,920
around why it was okay to just like DM Wimpy directly

234
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,760
in our telegram group, for instance, and say,

235
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,680
hey, I'm having this small little issue.

236
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,920
And so I thought if I was the developer,

237
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,640
I wouldn't want to be bombarded with all these like,

238
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,320
you know, single people trying to make me solve

239
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,900
the smallest little issues with the software,

240
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,400
either because it is a bug or because it's just like

241
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,520
a use case that me as the user, I'm not,

242
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,400
I haven't figured out yet.

243
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,360
You know, there's a learning curve

244
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,840
to every single application.

245
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,520
I'd be curious to hear what the rationale was.

246
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,920
Cause I also think I would be hesitant.

247
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,880
I am every time I reach out to a developer, I am hesitant.

248
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,080
So here's my thought on this too, is with free software,

249
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,360
you have the opportunity to experience

250
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,620
one of the greatest things in software development.

251
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,840
And that is you can interact with the developer directly

252
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,000
in the right situation and in the right scenario,

253
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,280
in the right context, engage with them,

254
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,120
and they will actually fix the thing

255
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,960
that you're asking about.

256
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,480
Like it's such an incredible experience

257
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,120
when you are so familiar with the commercial

258
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,160
customer experience where you buy a product,

259
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,320
maybe they offer support,

260
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,480
but you could never ask them to change anything.

261
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,900
You could never actually talk to the person creating it.

262
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,680
And it's such an amazing experience

263
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,460
when you have that kind of interaction.

264
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,080
Yeah, I mean, right in the commercial world,

265
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,600
maybe you have like a rep that you talk to

266
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,840
and you're sort of like kind of pushing,

267
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,240
being like, look, this really causes this problem,

268
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,760
but you have no insight into what happens upstream.

269
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,120
How does that get prioritized?

270
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,840
Are you just a small little fish?

271
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,080
Right, cause along with doing this process,

272
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,640
there's generally a public bug tracker.

273
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,880
So you can watch the status of your thing.

274
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,160
And that's, even if it's not going anywhere,

275
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,900
it's at least more access than you normally get.

276
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,460
But to properly navigate this,

277
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,320
I think Brent, you do have to go in

278
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,980
with a little bit of caution like you did.

279
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,960
I think you have to kind of suss out

280
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,800
how does this developer prefer to be approached?

281
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,480
And I may actually start,

282
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,120
if I figure out how to contact them in a way

283
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,800
that feels like it's appropriate,

284
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,100
I may actually start with the question of,

285
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,120
what is your preferred way for me to ask for help

286
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,960
or file a bug?

287
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,520
Not here's my problem, but hey, I know you're busy.

288
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,440
So I need to, I'd like to file this issue

289
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,520
because I'd like to help you fix it,

290
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,580
but what's the best way for me to do that?

291
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,640
And not actually starting with the problem,

292
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,640
but starting with the question of,

293
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,780
how do I go about asking the problem?

294
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,620
Yeah, I hadn't considered that

295
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,920
because I figured giving a small synopsis

296
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,300
of what was going on would be helpful,

297
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,680
but I think you're right.

298
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,440
Every project seems to have a different preference

299
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,640
on where to solve various problems.

300
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,680
You know, a bug tracker is not the right place

301
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,680
to ask a very simple usage question.

302
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,200
Some projects have IRCs for that or discords

303
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,160
and other technologies to just get people connected

304
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,360
for really simple questions.

305
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,260
And so I think actually that's very simple

306
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,720
and yet really good advice, so thank you.

307
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,920
Yeah, I think it's like sort of an empathy thing

308
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,160
of trying to understand.

309
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,600
Some projects will have that spelled out.

310
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,440
Other times you might need to explicitly ask

311
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,600
because they don't yet have documentation established

312
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,560
that might tell you where to go with that.

313
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,040
You know, which communities or forums

314
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,400
or methods they prefer for what types of communication.

315
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,680
The other thing is sometimes projects

316
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,000
have been around a while and they just have a legacy

317
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,960
of different trackers or different places

318
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,060
for community online.

319
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:17,200
And so it's like, okay, which one do I actually engage with?

320
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,840
That can sometimes be a problem for podcasts too.

321
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,320
So how did the whole bug squashing thing go

322
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,320
and how did it go with Wimpy?

323
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,160
Tell us more.

324
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:24,980
Did you squash any bugs?

325
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,000
I feel like there is a conclusion to this story.

326
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yeah, I think it's an adventure

327
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,200
and I don't think it ever concludes.

328
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,880
So for the small story with Wimpy,

329
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,880
I actually had this discussion after bedtime where he's at

330
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,000
and he never got back to me.

331
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,260
I think because probably it went into

332
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,400
a totally different place.

333
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,320
You know, my original question actually evolved

334
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,000
into a discussion about something else,

335
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,420
which he may have been interested in.

336
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,000
Maybe he didn't even see it.

337
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,640
And I just got around the copy and pasting problem

338
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,480
because I wanted to keep going on the project.

339
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,440
So that's where that landed.

340
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,920
So if anyone has any ideas on how to help me with that,

341
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,760
I'd love to hear.

342
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,080
So now he's turning to the audience.

343
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,920
Right?

344
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,000
It's interesting because that was my original approach

345
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,920
in the Telegram group.

346
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,360
And there was some great suggestions there.

347
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,120
There was a good point that was made during that discussion,

348
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,240
which was sometimes reaching to the community

349
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,460
for some help on a project is sometimes detrimental

350
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:22,540
because you can get information that leads you

351
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,120
to a workaround that maybe the project

352
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,640
doesn't necessarily think is the best solution

353
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,460
to your problem.

354
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,740
And that is kind of what I ended up finding,

355
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,540
you know, on the stack exchanges and stuff like that.

356
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,140
You end up with these potential solutions to your problem,

357
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,820
but they're kind of hacky sometimes

358
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,780
and getting the answer from the project itself

359
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,940
is probably far better.

360
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,140
You know, there's a very interesting thing happening

361
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,660
right now in the Home Assistant community

362
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,260
where the project is recommending,

363
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,100
you're laughing at me, Wes,

364
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,260
but the project is recommending that people migrate

365
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,500
from the old Z-Wave implementation,

366
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,500
integration, to Z-Wave GIS.

367
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,100
And they've even created a wizard

368
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,820
and they've been pretty clear about it

369
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,660
for the last six months.

370
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,180
And then they made an implicit recommendation

371
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,020
in the last Home Assistant release.

372
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,020
And in the next Home Assistant release,

373
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,740
they're gonna break the old Z-Wave integration.

374
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,220
So you really gotta migrate.

375
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,660
And when you go look up how to do this migration,

376
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,020
what you'll find, especially on Reddit,

377
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,900
is a bunch of people telling you to do something

378
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,340
completely different than what the project recommends.

379
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,300
A lot more complicated, requires a lot more skill sets,

380
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,140
it requires understanding MQTT

381
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,060
and it's a whole different world.

382
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,300
And there's no like really simple migration wizard

383
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,820
that they've set up.

384
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:36,100
And it's just, it's like because things become

385
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,500
tribal knowledge, like this is how you do something.

386
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,060
And so when new people come along,

387
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,820
like there's almost just like so much momentum

388
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,700
behind recommending something.

389
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,460
And sometimes what happens is the project changes, right?

390
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,460
They pivot, they choose a new direction

391
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,700
and the community doesn't necessarily change with them.

392
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,340
It could be saying something as well

393
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,340
about really great project documentation.

394
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,260
I feel like some projects have such great documentation

395
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:06,100
that's so up to date that that tends to be the go-to

396
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,660
for this kind of knowledge.

397
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,300
But I've often ran into projects who maybe have

398
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:16,060
some stale documentation or it's not clear

399
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,100
in its descriptions.

400
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,700
And so often the community has to kind of use

401
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,860
these other strategies to suggest fixes

402
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,180
where the project isn't kind of giving the information

403
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,020
that's required.

404
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:29,020
So I wonder if as a project that might be a place

405
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,220
to put energy where it makes it far easier for end users

406
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,460
to accomplish the things the project,

407
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,020
the direction the project wants to take them in.

408
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,820
It seems like sometimes there's also a sort of dichotomy

409
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,100
between what's happening in the pure upstream development

410
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,020
and the various use cases downstream.

411
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,660
It just makes me think of GNOME and plugins.

412
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,140
Like there may be something that the upstream

413
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,540
is not really interested in continuing development work on,

414
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,780
but the community continues to rely on

415
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,220
or thinks is worth continued support.

416
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,420
That's a tricky relationship.

417
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,620
Turns out, yeah, when you think about it,

418
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,260
it probably happens a lot in free software, humans.

419
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,500
I mean, this is one of the benefits.

420
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,740
It's just, as we know, software comes with maintenance,

421
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,100
burdens and expectations.

422
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,020
Yeah, I follow what you're saying,

423
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:10,220
but some of that also just puts more work on the project.

424
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,860
That's why I kind of feel like in free software specifically,

425
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,540
maybe some of that work should be taken on by the community.

426
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,100
Like I am, when I really want a developer

427
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,420
to fix something for me,

428
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,140
I feel like the onus is on me to come to them,

429
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,980
find them in the most appropriate way possible.

430
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,100
And, you know, documentation would be great.

431
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,860
Right, if the developer shares a tip

432
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,260
on how you might address something,

433
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,540
that may be an area where the community can say like,

434
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,660
oh, look, yeah, okay, I can add that to the Wiki.

435
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,900
Yeah, speaking of which, it's been making me think recently

436
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,420
that we need to like open up a bug tracker for JB,

437
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,700
just in general, for feature requests and things like that.

438
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,460
So that's something I think we want to talk about.

439
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,180
So, you know, just to kind of summarize our thoughts

440
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,900
on the topic of this,

441
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,940
when I decided to engage with a developer

442
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,780
and ask them to dockerize this stuff,

443
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:56,180
I also offered to throw them 20 bucks as a thank you,

444
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,620
just because I felt like, it felt awkward at first,

445
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,180
like, hey, you know, I'll give you, I'll throw money at you.

446
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,340
But then I thought, I can say thank you,

447
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,940
but there really is value for them in their time

448
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,820
for doing that work.

449
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,620
And I'm gonna get value out of having that software

450
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,700
run on my land indefinitely now.

451
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,100
Like it's, then all of a sudden, like 20, 30, 40 bucks

452
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,340
felt like hardly anything.

453
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,500
I was extremely appreciative because I started thinking of,

454
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,420
like, well, how valuable is this to me?

455
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,060
And I actually ended up sending them 100 bucks

456
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,460
as a thank you for getting that work done.

457
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,740
And the other reason why I kind of kicked it up a little bit

458
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,220
is because after they did the work,

459
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,860
other people came and piled on

460
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,100
and started having other issues with it

461
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,820
that I felt like we created more work for them.

462
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,300
So that was the other reason I kicked it up a little bit.

463
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,500
It's just a way to say thank you.

464
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,940
But I wanna, while we're talking about value,

465
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,700
I wanna talk about a really neat experience

466
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,460
that I had this weekend.

467
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:55,820
So yesterday, listener Cole came up to Lady Joob's, my RV,

468
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,020
to see Joob's, to meet me in person and the family.

469
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,860
And Cole's been a listener for over a decade,

470
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,420
perhaps even longer since perhaps maybe

471
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,140
before Dylan was even born.

472
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,020
He's now a commercial electrician by trade.

473
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,540
He's done the sys admin thing and still a big geek,

474
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,180
loves that stuff.

475
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,500
And our recent conversations about value for value

476
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,700
have sort of really resonated with him.

477
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,460
He's never really participated in any online community,

478
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,540
so he's never been in Mumble or Telegram.

479
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,060
He's never emailed into the show,

480
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,580
but he's listened to every episode.

481
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,420
Wow.

482
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,540
And that's not too uncommon.

483
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,740
I mean, that's how I am for most of the podcasts I listen to.

484
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,740
Seriously, same.

485
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,660
Yeah, I think it's the norm.

486
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,460
And, but I think for Cole,

487
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,020
he was trying to think of a way to contribute

488
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,980
that wasn't just like a financial contribution,

489
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,940
but something that would be another value contribution.

490
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,900
And I like this concept a lot

491
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,460
because I think it could also be applied to free software.

492
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,140
And so I sort of feel like I have felt so down

493
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,820
about software development funding,

494
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,500
free software development funding,

495
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,420
since like Heartbleed and that kind of stuff.

496
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,340
And it's starting to turn around

497
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,020
when I'm starting to connect these pieces

498
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,020
and it's still early days,

499
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,380
but I'm starting to see something here.

500
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,580
And because it resonated with Cole too,

501
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,100
he's like, I wanna contribute.

502
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,500
I've been listening to JB for over a decade.

503
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
I've gotten value out of some of the shows

504
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,180
and I wanted to do something for you that's valuable.

505
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,260
And I'm a commercial electrician.

506
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,300
And he had heard the story about the rack in the RV

507
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,860
and chewing up my wiring.

508
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,740
So we just got our slides fixed over the summer.

509
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,100
And then it freezes like a bastard here

510
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,340
in the Pacific Northwest and rats get into my RV

511
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,100
and they chew through the wiring and break my slides.

512
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,180
So I said, well, let me come up and take a look at it.

513
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,340
And so, yeah, okay, come up.

514
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,300
And he comes up.

515
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,340
So I gave him the full tour,

516
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:34,180
but I did a bit more of a focus on the electrical setup

517
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,260
and on the solar system.

518
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,540
And I explained to him the rat situation

519
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,500
and that the wire they chewed through

520
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,340
and that had he had fixed

521
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,860
and I showed him that kind of stuff.

522
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,980
And it was obvious that his experience

523
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,300
was gonna be instantly valuable

524
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,740
because he kind of just pretty quickly piece things together

525
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,620
that I wouldn't have understood.

526
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:55,340
And he explained that the way these switches work,

527
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,260
there is a multiplexer sitting between the controller

528
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,860
and the switches to send the different signals

529
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,780
because there's two wires for in

530
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,700
and there's two wires for out.

531
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,780
So you have each switch has four wires total

532
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,940
that run back to a multiplexer.

533
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,300
And then the multiplexer just has one wire

534
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,740
or two wires going to the controller.

535
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,980
So it takes all these wires and multiplexes it down.

536
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,180
And I didn't know that,

537
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,100
but Cole recognized that right away.

538
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:25,020
And so we started hunting for the multiplexer.

539
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,700
Cole's here on the hunt for the multiplexer.

540
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,660
That is definitely a false floor.

541
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,180
If you think so, it could be hidden under there.

542
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:34,180
There is definitely a cavity there.

543
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,100
But what I'm thinking that probably actually is,

544
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,940
is just for power.

545
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,900
And when I'm looking at it,

546
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,700
it does look like from that wiring harness,

547
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,020
the wires go in two directions.

548
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:52,100
So I'm thinking that maybe the multiplexer

549
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,460
is behind that panel.

550
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,140
Oh, behind the panel itself.

551
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:57,980
Yeah, which would make sense.

552
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,940
Should we take the panel off?

553
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,780
Yeah, I was gonna see.

554
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,500
Okay, let's take it apart then.

555
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,340
Let's just see if you guys are okay with me.

556
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,180
Yeah.

557
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,020
I would also like.

558
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:06,860
Yeah, I'd be curious too

559
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,940
to see what it looks like under there.

560
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,860
Yeah, yeah, and then I'm gonna ring it out.

561
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,140
See if I can see continuity between those connections

562
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,500
and see what we can see.

563
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,780
So it's a big panel with half a dozen switches on it

564
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:23,620
and LED lights to indicate sensors for tanks

565
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,100
and all that kind of stuff.

566
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,900
And we've never removed it from the wall,

567
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,100
but I've always been curious what it must look like

568
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,220
because it's just a ton of different switches

569
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,420
and lights and stuff and sensors in one spot.

570
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,700
What are you?

571
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,020
Yeah.

572
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:39,620
So Cole also brought like all his own tools

573
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,180
because he knows me, he's listened for a while

574
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,740
and he knows I'm not very handy.

575
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,340
You don't have the tools.

576
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,180
He's very polite about it though.

577
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,460
Just bring what you need, you know?

578
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,340
Yeah, so he brought his own set

579
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,260
and he had that panel opened up right away.

580
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:56,020
And I tell you what we found in there

581
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:59,420
still sits with me right now in an uncomfortable way.

582
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,900
Well, your problem is right here.

583
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,940
What do you see?

584
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:05,060
Oh, did they get up in the wall then?

585
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,460
Oh yeah.

586
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,020
Oh my God.

587
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,420
This right here is where your problem is.

588
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,980
You did a fantastic job down there, I got to say.

589
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,820
I did?

590
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,740
Down there on that side?

591
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,860
Yeah, you did a good job.

592
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,020
Good.

593
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:22,180
So they chewed not only the spot you fixed today,

594
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,580
but they chewed this area.

595
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,860
They got on the back of this board and chewed this.

596
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,260
They crawled up the wall.

597
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,100
Yeah, you can see the connector here.

598
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,940
This is why this one doesn't work.

599
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,020
There's nothing here.

600
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:35,860
Wow.

601
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,700
Yeah, there's the sensor.

602
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,820
This brown wire here is the sensor wire.

603
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,060
That's why the sensor isn't working.

604
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:39,900
Yep.

605
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,980
I can see the other end of that wire that they chewed.

606
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,820
Yep.

607
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,100
That red guy up there.

608
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,940
They were in everywhere.

609
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,020
They got everywhere then.

610
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:47,860
Yeah.

611
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,860
That is disturbing.

612
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,100
Yeah, it's not good, that's for sure.

613
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,220
I'm surprised other crap isn't busted then.

614
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,780
I just hate that they use this corn coating.

615
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,500
I just really, I get why they do it.

616
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,500
They do it because people abandon cars.

617
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,180
People leave cars around for years and years and years

618
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:10,660
and they don't want, it makes ecological sense.

619
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,900
But it's basically building your house out of a snack.

620
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,140
Can you believe this?

621
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,780
So it's corn wiring.

622
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,340
Gingerbread RV over there.

623
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,380
And they love it.

624
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,220
They love it.

625
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,060
Cole's in the chat room right now.

626
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,580
He says, it's probably not a bunch of rats.

627
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,420
I don't know.

628
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,620
I don't even know.

629
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,740
As far as I ever saw on camera, it's hard to say

630
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,860
because I just caught a rat on camera.

631
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,900
I don't know if it's, you know.

632
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,620
You know, my folks had a problem with this one.

633
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,260
They're cars, but it was like a soy-based wine,

634
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:34,020
but same thing, tasty wire covering.

635
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,140
Who would have thought?

636
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,540
Yeah, unbelievable.

637
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:40,660
So then we did a run out to the hardware store

638
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:44,340
and I'm ashamed to admit it.

639
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,060
I don't own a soldering iron at home.

640
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,540
We have one here at the studio, but we did the math

641
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:51,540
and we're like, do we drive to the studio and pick it up?

642
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,220
Or do we just go to the hardware store

643
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,140
that's like five minutes away

644
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,100
and I just have one at home too.

645
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,420
So they had a decent soldering iron,

646
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,940
but they did not have like the best solder options

647
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,780
and stuff like that.

648
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,620
Yeah, of course not.

649
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,460
But he got it all done.

650
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,940
He helped Tadia learn how to do some of the soldering too.

651
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,540
It was her first experience and got it patched up

652
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,540
and it's working.

653
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,580
It's working.

654
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,060
Oh, you're like fully back in slide action.

655
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,260
Yeah, that's a quality of life improvement for us.

656
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,260
It's a lot of value.

657
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,620
It was huge and it was so nice of Cole

658
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,580
to come up and do that.

659
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,060
Well, it's almost the coming full circle

660
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:25,020
and just from the past year and a half or longer, right?

661
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,540
Like before your whole journey

662
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,500
of preparing this, like you just,

663
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,540
you're actually back in a fully functional lady juice, right?

664
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,500
Oh my gosh, man.

665
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,340
Oh my gosh.

666
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,780
And now I'm ready to like redo the whole tech setup.

667
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,060
I'm not exactly sure what hardware setup I'm going with yet,

668
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,660
but I'm like getting in that space.

669
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,900
I feel like talked a little bit last week

670
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,300
about some of the software I'm gonna load,

671
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,140
like a spring reload.

672
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,060
I think there's gonna be several Mac Studios.

673
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,900
Yeah, yeah.

674
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:51,060
A couple of Mac Studios running under the booth.

675
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:55,420
It's just about 12 grand of Macs in there, that's all.

676
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,140
Yeah, yeah, that should be great.

677
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,460
A lot of horsepower.

678
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,540
Of course, I think they're probably all would use

679
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,180
Intel emulation for all the software.

680
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,020
Right.

681
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,740
But wow, it's been great.

682
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,580
It's been really great.

683
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,100
And I'll have all that figured out soon.

684
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,340
I'll get all that.

685
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,580
And with Cole too, I was showing him some of my,

686
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,980
like how I hacked to bring the Starlink

687
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,820
and stuff like that.

688
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,660
Oh, nice, yeah.

689
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,900
Showing him ideas I had around cooling.

690
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,140
So it's all, you know, it's just really great.

691
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:22,700
It has been so like, you know, people say,

692
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,460
you know, you can be wealthy in ways

693
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,220
that are not money.

694
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,500
But it really feels like that is true

695
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,820
when it comes to our community.

696
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,660
Yeah.

697
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,260
And I think we have been particularly spoiled

698
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,460
here in the Pacific Northwest,

699
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,820
with just some really great people in this area.

700
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,300
And then we travel, and you know,

701
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,980
every time we're traveling,

702
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,500
we hear from people that are offering,

703
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,820
you know, hey, I got a driveway, you can stop in it.

704
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,020
And this is just wild, right?

705
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,500
Like you're in a strange place

706
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,340
and you automatically have friends.

707
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,700
Crazy people out there.

708
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,660
You crazy people.

709
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,260
Linode.com slash unplugged.

710
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,380
You know, I should call up my friends at Linode

711
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,540
and we should talk about having them come join us

712
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:59,340
at the barbecue, because they know a great meetup

713
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,980
when they see when they helped us put together

714
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,220
the Denver meetup.

715
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,220
They were absolutely essential in that.

716
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,740
Go sign up at Linode and support the show

717
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:08,340
by going to linode.com slash unplugged.

718
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,980
You'll get $100 in 60 day credit on your new account.

719
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,820
And you're gonna support this here show.

720
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,100
Linode's where we run everything up in the cloud.

721
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,820
These are, I'm in everything, everything.

722
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,900
And you can start with like a five.

723
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,260
This is how I personally started with Linode.

724
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,540
I mean, you know, you do you,

725
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:25,460
but I started with like a $5 a month system.

726
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,980
I put sync thing on it.

727
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,900
I was like, well, I will use this

728
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,380
to just move between all of my on-premises stuff.

729
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,700
I'm just gonna do all on-premises.

730
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,340
And I did use it like that for a while.

731
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,780
But as I started kind of just understanding more

732
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,340
about Linode, the company, the culture,

733
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,860
the people behind it,

734
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,860
I realized that I could trust it for my business.

735
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,420
I could trust it for my mission critical stuff.

736
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,580
I could trust it for my wife's business.

737
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,580
Like that kind of stuff really is what resonated with me

738
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,740
is I just understood it better.

739
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,260
And then, you know, as time comes up,

740
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,620
it has gone up, I've made friends over there

741
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,180
and I kind of see the way they work.

742
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,660
And I've been watching on some of the things

743
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,500
that they're building,

744
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,740
like their database as a service product

745
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,420
that they're rolling out right now.

746
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:05,460
And you get to choose from 11 data centers around the world

747
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,900
and every service level you go with,

748
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,020
from their $5 a month system

749
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:15,380
to their like crazy bonanza, epic CPUs and MVME storages

750
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,260
and all that kind of stuff this is,

751
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,220
they're gonna give you the same great customer support.

752
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:22,220
It doesn't matter, they got the best in the business.

753
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,460
And honestly, I've never really had to rely on it

754
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,460
cause everything's always been really great for me,

755
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:31,780
but I have heard such a consistent feedback

756
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,620
from the audience that,

757
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,300
hey, I got in a jam and they really helped me out.

758
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,900
I've heard that over and over again

759
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,220
and that they've always blown away everybody's expectations.

760
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,300
So I like to mention it because I think

761
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,700
in a moment when that matters,

762
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,140
that's gonna be nearly priceless.

763
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,300
And they're willing to do that for you

764
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,340
with a $5 a month account.

765
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,740
It's pretty impressive.

766
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,500
So go check them out, try it out, support the show,

767
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,900
go learn something, build something,

768
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,340
just enjoy the performance.

769
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:57,420
It's just a lot of fun to play with a system that fast

770
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,820
and you get a hundred dollars to do it

771
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,180
and it's a way to support the show.

772
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:03,500
So it's lino.com slash unplugged.

773
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:10,980
Well, I think it's that time again, feedback.

774
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,900
Ray wrote in this week, talking about experience

775
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,100
with free and open source software.

776
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,980
Wes's recent positive experience working

777
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:22,620
with an open source project inspired me to share my own.

778
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,940
After setting up TailScale on all my machines

779
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,380
to experiment with mesh networking,

780
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,180
I took an interest in HeadScale,

781
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,900
the open source version of the TailScale control plane.

782
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,500
Everything was working pretty great,

783
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:38,340
but I ran into an issue adding a particular machine

784
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,660
and went to the GitHub repo to seek some assistance.

785
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,580
I was directed to their Discord server

786
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,380
and within two minutes I was talking

787
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,460
with more than one HeadScale developer.

788
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,260
They were welcoming and helpful

789
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,820
and we actually discovered my issue

790
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,980
was due to a bug in the HeadScale code.

791
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,580
I filed a bug and the fix was merged within a week.

792
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,820
I wanted to highlight this project

793
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,900
because the process was so pleasant

794
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,380
and felt truly community led.

795
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,540
The people working on the project really believe in it

796
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:11,100
and are open to input and contributions.

797
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,780
That is great to hear.

798
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,260
I have also had a great experience.

799
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,860
I have a business relationship with them.

800
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,820
They are a sponsor of Self-Hosted, so disclosure there.

801
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:23,300
If you'd like to sign up and get a personal account for free

802
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:27,980
with up to 20 devices, it's tailscale.com slash SSH I think.

803
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:31,860
But I have interacted with them from that side.

804
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,340
And a couple of the people I chatted with

805
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,100
were already Self-Hosted listeners.

806
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,340
So that's always a good sign

807
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,460
because it shows you they're really into this stuff.

808
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,820
If they're listening to my geeky podcasts,

809
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,260
they must really like this stuff.

810
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,820
And that's kind of a sign to me that the staff are into it.

811
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,780
And I've had a good experience.

812
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:50,300
The same two, I will say, kind of a same line of thinking

813
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,420
is I feel like I always have to give an honorable mention

814
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,460
right here to the Nebula project.

815
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:57,020
Both Wes and I have had great interactions

816
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,740
with the Nebula developer.

817
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:03,340
It has been also a great solution for mesh VPN network.

818
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,100
So it's really nice to see some good options

819
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,660
in the space right now.

820
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,580
Now, we kind of got in trouble last week

821
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:13,860
because, well, we didn't plan last week's episode

822
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,000
much like this episode was completely unplanned.

823
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,580
And so we were just going with the flow

824
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:22,140
and I think we ended up hurting some sensitive ears.

825
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,500
Yeah, we actually got a piece of mail

826
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:27,460
that I think at once is both wonderful to hear

827
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,780
and also some really good criticism

828
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,380
that I think I agree with.

829
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:34,460
So Gene wrote in about our last episode.

830
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,540
He said, my toddler and I tend to listen

831
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,300
to your podcasts in the car.

832
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,700
That's the part where I think is really great.

833
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,940
I had to turn Linux Unplugged 448 off partway through

834
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:48,180
because you all were continually saying F-U-C-K

835
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:52,280
and that's not exactly what I want him parroting at daycare.

836
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,440
I'm really disappointed that we couldn't listen

837
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,720
to this episode together, but even more disappointed

838
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,900
that there was no warning at the top of the show

839
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,340
that this episode was going to not be kid friendly.

840
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,500
I'd really appreciate it if you all would keep kids in mind

841
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,300
when choosing your language for the show

842
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,260
as I really like sharing these shows with mine.

843
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,920
I thought that was great feedback.

844
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,820
It was tricky because the project itself,

845
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:18,820
if you both remember, was called Brain F-U-C-K

846
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:22,660
and that was hard to get around, but any thoughts on this?

847
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,380
You know, this is definitely something

848
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:27,620
that we bounce around a lot inside internally

849
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:32,220
because we don't believe in sort of pretense

850
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,440
of pretending we're something we're not,

851
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,760
but at the same time, you know, I'm a dad and I get this.

852
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,180
I think for the most part, we have very rarely sworn

853
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,580
on this show just because we want everybody

854
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,700
to be able to listen and we don't want that to be a barrier

855
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,900
for why you listen and we also love the idea

856
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,720
of kids listening.

857
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,700
I think that, you know, getting kids into technology,

858
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:56,300
especially something that's focused on open source,

859
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,460
free software and not centralized, you know,

860
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,580
typical things like Instagram and social media.

861
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,100
I think that's a great, I think that's great

862
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,740
to get kids thinking in that direction.

863
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:07,260
I think where it gets maybe tricky is that we're not,

864
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,020
we're kind of in the gray area in that I don't think

865
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,420
we're thinking about kids explicitly

866
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,840
when we're crafting the show or, you know,

867
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,080
like that's not necessarily where I could target audience,

868
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,660
even if it's a welcome subset and then at the same time,

869
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,540
we're not explicitly like some other podcast,

870
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:22,740
we're not explicitly saying that we're an adult only show.

871
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,220
Right, right, yep.

872
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,860
Yeah, so there is, it's just a balance that I think we walk.

873
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,960
Like we don't make the show for any one particular audience,

874
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,100
but we try to consider as many of them as possible.

875
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,660
That's probably the way to put that.

876
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,740
You know, and often the feedback that we get in that regard

877
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:39,300
as you just heard is, has a tone, you know,

878
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,260
I'll just leave it at that.

879
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,380
And so that sometimes makes it hard to internalize

880
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:45,420
that feedback in a way that doesn't make me angry.

881
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,340
But I think when you hear the message

882
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,980
that they're trying to get to, it's pretty understandable.

883
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:52,660
Yeah, I think asking for a heads up is entirely reasonable.

884
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,460
We heard from a lot of people about Bookstack

885
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,420
and David wrote in, he said,

886
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,380
I've been using Bookstack for a few months

887
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,480
and I think it's superb.

888
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,980
It's really elegant, it's easy to use

889
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,820
and it can be used internally for organizational info.

890
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:07,060
And I also got a, I think Cole recommended Bookstack

891
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:07,900
as well.

892
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,720
Is that right?

893
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,500
Lyndon also wrote in, said that I'm using Bookstack

894
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,460
for way too much.

895
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,340
It might be too good.

896
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,540
That's great.

897
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,380
I like when people tell us where they're coming in from too.

898
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,260
Like David's coming in from Wales.

899
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,100
That's amazing.

900
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:20,920
Aww.

901
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,760
Keep that up.

902
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,540
I think that's great.

903
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:27,100
Trev wrote in to say, Trev was on fire this week.

904
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,780
I think I saw Trev right into a couple of shows.

905
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:33,500
As an Emacs user, I use the vulnerable org mode

906
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:38,380
to organize my notes, agenda reminders and long time tasks.

907
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:42,300
Yes, we should have given org mode an honorable mention.

908
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,820
We did an episode of self-hosted on org mode.

909
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,940
Yeah, that was a great episode.

910
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,580
If you'd like to check that out.

911
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,780
All right, moving right along.

912
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,860
This is a lot of feedback you guys.

913
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,060
So I'm kind of moving at a quicker clip here

914
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:56,660
but we also got some mentions for Obsidian.

915
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,940
Obsidian I believe has also been talked a bit

916
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,380
about on self-hosted.

917
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:04,240
I am not somebody who I, Obsidian just doesn't work

918
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,500
for the way I work but I think it works for a lot of people

919
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,660
especially people who like to link things to other things

920
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,980
and then have visuals that show them their cluster

921
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,180
of linkages, Obsidian can be great for that.

922
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,860
And it's also a markdown at graphs on graphs on graphs.

923
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,820
Yeah.

924
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,660
Yeah.

925
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,740
Wow.

926
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,840
Whew.

927
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,000
I got to take a break from that.

928
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,840
It was too much.

929
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,440
It's a lot of, so this is actually maybe a chance for me

930
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,940
to get into a little bit of a soap box thing if I can.

931
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,820
Do you want the walnut soap box?

932
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:33,580
It needs to probably hold some weight for a bit

933
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:36,260
cause let's be honest, I could stand to lose a few pounds

934
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,920
and this is a big soap box here.

935
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:44,660
And now as the French say, it is time for the boost.

936
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,300
So I want to talk about these boosts for a minute

937
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,220
cause you probably heard we've been doing these

938
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,060
in the damn show.

939
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,400
They hardly make any damn sense.

940
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,780
Most of you don't know what the hell they are

941
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,700
and you don't know why all of a sudden we're doing them.

942
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,940
And I want to talk about this because this right here

943
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:04,820
is I hope the very groundwork for a revolutionary way

944
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:07,280
to monetize free software and content

945
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,420
that can remain independent.

946
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,260
And I'm going to start here.

947
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:14,100
This is, we're going to have a little dad time now

948
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,020
and I'm just going to tell you the way something is

949
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,960
and you're just going to have to accept it.

950
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,980
And that is that independent podcasting

951
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,460
has about three years left, maybe five

952
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,540
if you've got a huge established audience.

953
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:28,100
And outside of that, it's going to be Mad Max territory

954
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,480
for independent podcasts.

955
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,140
It's getting bad.

956
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:36,140
YouTube is large and it is specifically reaching out

957
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,940
to podcasters to move to its platform.

958
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,540
But you may already heard that.

959
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,720
What you do not know because you have not been

960
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,160
in these conversations, but I and friends have been

961
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:50,940
in these conversations, is that traditional podcast sponsors

962
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:54,020
have found that YouTube works better for them

963
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,340
than podcasts do.

964
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,780
They're wrong, but here's their rationale.

965
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,420
And when you hear it, you're going to see why they do this.

966
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:04,140
Number one, they love the idea of link down

967
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:04,960
in the description.

968
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,980
They think that makes more engagement.

969
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:10,460
And they think that means that people click through easily

970
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,060
more often because the links right there

971
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,820
down in the description.

972
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:18,220
Number two, is that YouTube is a giant centralized platform

973
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:22,220
that generates a lot of metadata about its audience

974
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,660
and about the creators and about the interconnections

975
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,360
between those creators and audience.

976
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,660
That allows sponsors to build tooling

977
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,580
to essentially slice and dice the market up for them.

978
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,420
So they can go in and say,

979
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,820
I want 10,000 people that are interested in this.

980
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:39,140
And I want to get this percentage of women

981
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,900
and I want to get a content creator

982
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,740
who's also connected with this content creator.

983
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,820
And I want to ride this hype wave over here.

984
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:48,580
What they do, and it's disgusting,

985
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,980
is they will engage directly with these channels

986
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,500
and they will do sponsored videos

987
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:57,500
with absolutely no disclosure that that video is sponsored.

988
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:01,280
Or it'll be like a really limp attempt at it.

989
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,720
Like maybe down in the description,

990
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,840
it'll say sponsored by.

991
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:09,040
And it turns out like the manufacturer of the laptop

992
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,260
was the one sponsoring the entire video,

993
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,720
but they don't actually say that in the video.

994
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,280
That kind of stuff is rampant on YouTube.

995
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,180
And the reality is sponsors love it.

996
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,220
They love that kind of native ad stuff.

997
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,020
They love it.

998
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,100
They love that they can use generic tooling

999
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,540
and they love that they can buy five or 10 creators

1000
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,980
in a couple of clicks

1001
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,980
and that those creators don't even have to disclose,

1002
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:32,820
even though they're supposed to,

1003
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,760
they don't even disclose

1004
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,740
that they're being sponsored sometimes.

1005
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,540
They love that kind of stuff.

1006
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:40,180
Then you've got Spotify who's squeezing the market,

1007
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,820
trying to centralize over there.

1008
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,020
Now, independent podcasting that's unmonetized,

1009
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,180
well, that's a hobby

1010
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,380
and that's gonna just continue as people prefer.

1011
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:53,380
But unique crafted content

1012
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:58,220
that is the sole focus of content creators is fading.

1013
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,060
It's going away.

1014
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:02,560
I mean, honestly, how many Linux content creators

1015
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,400
do you know that actually do Linux content creation

1016
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,540
full time?

1017
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,060
Counting myself, I can think of Joe.

1018
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,540
So that's two.

1019
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,300
Everybody else has contract work.

1020
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,900
They got side gigs.

1021
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,820
Maybe Nick over the Linux experiment is doing it full time.

1022
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,900
I'm not sure, but it's like maybe no more

1023
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,500
than three or four content creators.

1024
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,140
And then you got Larble over at Ferronix.

1025
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,340
When you start getting into the written media,

1026
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,420
you got a little bit more.

1027
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,580
You got Joe at OMG Ubuntu, you've got LWN.

1028
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:31,640
But again, this is like under a dozen at all

1029
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,300
for this entire ecosystem.

1030
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,460
Like I think our niche is particularly vulnerable

1031
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,620
to this problem.

1032
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:40,620
And this brings on an obvious need for a change,

1033
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,220
which is why this conversation around the boosts

1034
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,820
has been coming up more and memberships

1035
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,500
that we launched a little while ago,

1036
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,580
because I'm trying to get ahead of this thing.

1037
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,540
I have been doing this for 15 years

1038
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,180
and I figure I've got about five years left

1039
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,900
to figure out how to make this sustainable forever.

1040
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:59,500
It's been a good run, but the music's coming to an end.

1041
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,140
And when I first saw Boost, what I saw was,

1042
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,460
okay, that's a great way for somebody

1043
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,780
to contribute a one-off contribution.

1044
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,140
And I thought, okay, I could really see

1045
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,500
how that also work with free software.

1046
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,140
Like the two are very clear for me

1047
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,420
and we are the world's largest Linux podcast.

1048
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,660
So if we help establish a system like this

1049
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,560
that people adopt and consider normal,

1050
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,020
then that may actually help move the needle a little bit.

1051
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:22,140
Like if we do the groundwork here,

1052
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,260
it may actually open the flood gates at one point.

1053
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,940
Like there's a real possibility for the show

1054
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,800
to make a difference in this area.

1055
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,460
And it's early, right?

1056
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,220
Like my peers don't even know

1057
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,380
what the hell I'm talking about.

1058
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,480
Like they don't even know, they think I've lost my mind.

1059
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,260
They don't even have any idea because it's so new

1060
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,160
and they're focused on what they do, right?

1061
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,320
Like, so it's early days still.

1062
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,540
But what I have noticed,

1063
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,900
now that we've been doing the Boost for a little bit,

1064
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,500
is there's something extra special there.

1065
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,860
And let me give you a little bit of background here.

1066
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,260
The cheapest, easiest, simplest way to comment

1067
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,420
is always going to lead to the worst comments.

1068
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,700
YouTube and Reddit are an example of this.

1069
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,880
Very low friction to leave a comment,

1070
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,300
very little individual thought has to go into each comment.

1071
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,620
And so you just get the worst comments.

1072
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,620
You step it up to Telegram and Twitter,

1073
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:08,080
things get a little bit better, but not much.

1074
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,180
You know what I'm talking about.

1075
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:12,580
Then you step it up to email.

1076
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,500
There things usually get pretty good.

1077
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,500
You know, you get a range of the type of feedback,

1078
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,620
but it's generally been thought through.

1079
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,740
It's often a couple of paragraphs long.

1080
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:25,380
It's not very, not great on the back end

1081
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:28,100
in terms of us having to process it and put it on air

1082
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,140
and try to read through it in a way

1083
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,940
that doesn't put you to sleep and that kind of stuff.

1084
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:33,720
But you get links, you get references,

1085
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,220
you get an actual full thought out email.

1086
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:40,120
Like that was what, email has been the peak of feedback.

1087
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,980
And that's why we push people to the contact page.

1088
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:46,380
But Boost hit that golden ratio in a way

1089
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:50,500
that is fundamentally a big improvement

1090
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,420
for the production of the show.

1091
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,940
Because the feedback that comes in,

1092
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,480
because A, you have to have one of these new podcast apps,

1093
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,500
newpodcastapps.com.

1094
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,780
B, you gotta put some change in this wallet

1095
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,500
on this podcast app.

1096
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,220
And then C, you gotta subscribe to our show

1097
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,580
or listen to our show in the podcast app

1098
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,140
and send us a Boost in there.

1099
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,780
That eliminates 90% of people almost.

1100
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,700
And it's changing, right?

1101
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:15,560
It'll be 80%, and then it'll be 70%,

1102
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,280
just like the Linux desktop has been,

1103
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,560
just like Matrix has been,

1104
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,160
just like everything that our audience has pioneered.

1105
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,240
Early adopters start, and our audience is always

1106
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,740
some of the very first to try something

1107
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,940
that's a sensible technology.

1108
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,580
And so it kind of self-selects

1109
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,620
who's giving us feedback at the same time.

1110
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,800
They're like limited to 300 characters.

1111
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,820
So it's easy for us to process and consume them,

1112
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,740
and we can actually export them and sort them by show,

1113
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,180
and we can see what show they were listening to

1114
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,980
if they want to include that information.

1115
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:45,420
And they have the opportunity

1116
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,620
to give us a little bit of value.

1117
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:49,580
And sometimes it's like a hundredth of a penny, right?

1118
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,340
And then sometimes it's like a couple of bucks.

1119
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:55,260
And it comes into a system that we can process

1120
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,320
and then put into the show in a way that's quick.

1121
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:01,860
And it gives the audience a chance to buy in, right?

1122
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,500
It gives them a little bit of ownership.

1123
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,100
It gives them an opportunity to contribute something

1124
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,020
and supply a message.

1125
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:11,200
It's created this manageable, valuable channel

1126
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,500
for feedback and ideas that are coming into the show

1127
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,860
that are giving us ideas to try things

1128
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,540
we've never even considered before.

1129
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,500
And I just never expected that

1130
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,820
when we started using the Boost.

1131
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:22,820
And so that's why we've been featuring the Boost more.

1132
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:25,840
And because I think the ideals of the podcast index

1133
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:29,500
and the podcasting 2.0 movement are necessary

1134
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,660
for the long-term sustainability of independent podcasting.

1135
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,100
And that independent podcasting

1136
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,700
that has traditionally been ad financed

1137
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,840
is gonna have to go through some bit of transition.

1138
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,540
It may not be a hundred percent transition.

1139
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,740
I don't know, it's gonna be different for everybody.

1140
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,520
But that S is coming.

1141
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,940
And I think a lot of the people around me

1142
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:47,820
haven't even figured out

1143
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,100
until they're listening to this episode.

1144
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,700
And then they're gonna listen to the words I'm saying

1145
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,920
and they're gonna realize I've been doing this

1146
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,580
for a long time and I know what the hell I'm talking about.

1147
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,740
And they're gonna have to start making a change.

1148
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:00,900
Just like that bill's been coming due in free software.

1149
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,300
But I think we have an opportunity here to do it right

1150
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,780
and to do it in a way that orients everyone's priorities

1151
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:08,740
to the audience or to the software creators.

1152
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,500
It's a huge movement that could be happening.

1153
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,380
And it's not just this show.

1154
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:14,220
So I think that's the other thing to consider.

1155
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,780
So that right there is my soapbox.

1156
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:19,340
Why don't we do our first Boost?

1157
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:22,180
Awesome Matt wrote in again and he said,

1158
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,900
really enjoying episode 448.

1159
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,780
Encrypted show notes idea is great

1160
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,580
and would love to see that again.

1161
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,900
I would do it again.

1162
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,940
I had a lot of fun doing that episode.

1163
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,620
Yeah, but you can't pick the same encryption.

1164
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:33,780
No, I think you're right.

1165
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:36,540
I think we'd have to come up with a new method.

1166
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:40,620
Maybe could we allow for linking to our show notes?

1167
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:44,860
So like maybe all you have to encrypt is the URL.

1168
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,180
Is that too much of a cop out?

1169
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:48,940
Because then that wouldn't be this massive challenge

1170
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,460
massive chunk of text.

1171
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,360
Yeah, right, all right.

1172
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,580
Yeah, you'd allow, you'd allow it?

1173
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:56,540
I suppose some sort of uniform resource locating system.

1174
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,340
We'll start brainstorming on that.

1175
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,500
All right, watch out Wes, here comes one.

1176
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,900
Oh, this one's from sexy pants excellent.

1177
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,180
Okay.

1178
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,660
Maybe you should start a podcast

1179
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:10,380
covering your life with ADHD.

1180
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,220
There's a YouTube channel that covers it.

1181
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:14,260
How to ADHD.com.

1182
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,860
Maybe you should reach out to them and do an interview.

1183
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,020
I don't know.

1184
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:19,620
I too suffer from the beast

1185
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:22,540
and it's just such a pain and makes things so hard.

1186
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:23,380
Hmm.

1187
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,220
What do you think about that, Chris?

1188
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:26,180
And a podcast on it, huh?

1189
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:27,820
Maybe like we could do an extra.

1190
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:31,460
You know what's funny about that whole ADHD thing?

1191
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:35,140
I was diagnosed as a young lad

1192
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:38,860
and then re-diagnosed in my late 20s.

1193
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:41,760
And I feel like I was always in denial

1194
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,500
that it affected me.

1195
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,380
Like, oh, I've got control over this.

1196
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,180
I can manage this.

1197
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:52,340
And being a dad, I realized that is not true.

1198
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:56,580
I actually do, this is actually a real issue.

1199
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,420
This ADHD thing is real.

1200
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,780
And sometimes I have no governance

1201
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:03,500
over what my mind switches focus to.

1202
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,940
And it can be really tricky.

1203
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:06,580
I mean, even when we're doing the show

1204
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:09,020
I've got a pen in my hand right now so I can jot down notes.

1205
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:10,980
So that way I don't squirrel away

1206
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,660
and forget that I was gonna talk about something.

1207
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:14,660
So I've kind of, you know,

1208
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:17,180
created myself a few tools to manage it.

1209
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:20,380
But how to ADHD.com sounds like the place

1210
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:21,960
that he liked a lot.

1211
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,300
So thanks for sending that in.

1212
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,260
That is something to think about.

1213
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:27,500
I'd like to, I think talking about challenges

1214
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,960
of how to optimize how you work,

1215
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:29,900
how do you get in the zone,

1216
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,500
how do you do whatever you do really well.

1217
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,900
I love talking about that stuff.

1218
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,580
I feel like it's not like a love topic

1219
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,540
but I'd be willing to talk about it somewhere sometime.

1220
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:40,700
Maybe a live stream or something could do that.

1221
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:41,720
Nick wrote in, he said,

1222
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,780
hey guys, listening to Love 448 and I just heard

1223
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:46,460
you mentioned Tor.

1224
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:49,420
Check out Onion Share, an open source tool

1225
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:52,660
that lets you share files and even host a small website.

1226
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:54,100
Thanks for the show.

1227
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:56,860
And it's at onionshare.org.

1228
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,420
Also, just a quick pause before we get into it.

1229
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:01,100
This is another thing I like about the boosts

1230
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:04,320
is Nick sent that in while we were talking about it.

1231
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,420
So he's hearing us talk about it in the app, right?

1232
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:07,560
And he's hitting the boost button

1233
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,860
while we're talking about Tor,

1234
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:10,300
which I just think is super cool.

1235
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,780
Have we talked about Onion Share before?

1236
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,500
I feel like that must have come up on the show.

1237
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,580
Oh no, you know there's a flat pack.

1238
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,500
Yeah, yeah, we'll put a link to that in the show notes.

1239
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,620
This is, I feel like maybe not getting enough attention

1240
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:23,060
when I started looking at Onion Share

1241
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:24,780
because it, yeah, it lets you share files

1242
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:27,460
and receive files and send files and all that kind of stuff.

1243
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,060
But it's also a chat client.

1244
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:32,180
So you could do like a private chat over Tor.

1245
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:35,420
You can generate URLs to link people to files

1246
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:37,280
or to receive a file.

1247
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,540
It's got all that kind of stuff.

1248
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:41,580
Plus it's got this static website hosting

1249
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:44,620
that lets you host a static website on Tor.

1250
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:45,940
I mean, probably not the way

1251
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,980
you're gonna wanna run a serious website,

1252
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,420
but if you're just looking for something

1253
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:52,100
for a day or two or whatever, I mean, I don't know.

1254
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,580
This is really a lot.

1255
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:55,280
Like that hosting a static website

1256
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,540
kind of takes it up to the next level.

1257
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:57,980
Like the sending files and chatting,

1258
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:59,580
that almost feels like table stakes.

1259
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:02,620
But then I see you host a website, I'm like, oh damn.

1260
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:04,300
Looks like a nice little experience too.

1261
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:08,660
Yeah, so yeah, man, check out onionshare.org.

1262
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:10,020
That looks really good.

1263
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:13,420
We have been talking about Tor behind the scenes.

1264
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:15,820
And interestingly, if you go into the matrix

1265
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:20,580
and you look at the LUP feedback channel in matrix,

1266
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:22,340
they're like, that's what they've been talking about

1267
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:25,700
for the last week is Tor and Onion stuff.

1268
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:29,020
And just discussing like how Onion URLs work.

1269
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,280
It's actually a really cool conversation.

1270
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,460
And there's some conversation there about Obsidian as well.

1271
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,860
So onionshare.org, go check that out.

1272
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:39,020
And then one last thing while we're talking about podcasts

1273
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:42,900
and the boosts, there are now 5,000 podcasts

1274
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,940
according to Kevin Rook that are on the lightning network

1275
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,380
for monetization, 5,000 podcasts.

1276
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:50,820
So while it may sound early in our circle

1277
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:54,140
where we are at in the Linux community,

1278
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:56,780
there are other communities that are making this work

1279
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:57,760
and have figured it out.

1280
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,800
And that's where I'm kind of seeing some parallels

1281
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,540
that I think could apply to the free software community

1282
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:05,660
and what we're doing here.

1283
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:06,560
That's it.

1284
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,400
That's it.

1285
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,240
Are you good?

1286
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,080
Are we good?

1287
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,020
I got it out of my system.

1288
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:12,140
Thank you for letting me get on my soapbox.

1289
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:13,140
Yeah, it helps.

1290
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,460
You can keep the box.

1291
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:18,180
That's just cause my feet were messy, right?

1292
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:19,260
Yeah, that's yeah.

1293
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:20,460
Boost to grand.

1294
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:21,660
He spilled some onions too.

1295
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:22,540
Yeah, that's true.

1296
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:23,660
That's true.

1297
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:27,060
I see you snuck a pic into today's doc there, Chris,

1298
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:30,340
or at least what remains of today's doc.

1299
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:34,260
Heroic Games Launcher, an open source GOG

1300
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,420
and Epic Games Launcher, you know,

1301
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,740
for the stuff that isn't on Steam.

1302
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:40,340
Just basically that.

1303
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:43,860
And if you get in yourself a deck,

1304
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:48,860
it's a lot easier to just go the Flatpak route for stuff.

1305
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:51,300
And that's why I thought this is some pretty good timing

1306
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,740
for the Heroic Game Launcher to land as a Flatpak.

1307
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,460
So I have a link to it up on Flathub.

1308
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:56,940
And it's like what Wes said,

1309
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,620
you can bring in your GOG games

1310
00:47:58,620 --> 00:47:59,980
and probably more importantly for me,

1311
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:02,860
like I've got like maybe one Epic game ever.

1312
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:04,780
But I, you know, what am I gonna do?

1313
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:06,500
Install the Epic Windows software thing.

1314
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:07,580
It's just junk.

1315
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:09,220
So this lets you bypass all of that.

1316
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:13,660
And if you have yourself one of them Deckard Cain devices,

1317
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:14,580
you can put this on there.

1318
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:15,700
And then maybe tell us about it.

1319
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:18,380
Yeah, actually, I'd love to hear your thoughts on that.

1320
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:19,220
I'd be really curious.

1321
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:20,060
Let us know.

1322
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:21,420
You can tweet us at Linux Unplugged

1323
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:25,760
or the feedback page is linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

1324
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,180
Or you know what?

1325
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:29,520
Send us a gosh darn boost.

1326
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,020
We'd love to get those too.

1327
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32,820
And we have that up during the day.

1328
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:35,260
I watch them come in as people say stuff to us.

1329
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:36,820
And then links to everything we talked about today

1330
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:39,740
at linuxunplugged.com slash for Fortnite.

1331
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:40,560
Keep an eye out.

1332
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,820
We'll probably do some either,

1333
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:44,520
we'll either do an episode of Linux Unplugged

1334
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,980
or we'll do an extra in the future all about IPFS.

1335
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:49,060
We did a lot of work on it.

1336
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:51,140
We just, we feel like it deserves

1337
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:53,140
a little more breathing room, you know?

1338
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:54,180
You know, you can always subscribe

1339
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,640
to some sort of all shows feed

1340
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:56,680
if you just didn't wanna worry

1341
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:57,740
about where that might show up.

1342
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:59,740
Some kind of all shows feed.

1343
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:01,060
Then you just get it all.

1344
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:02,700
The self-hosted show, the Koda Radio show,

1345
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:07,300
Linux Action News, which is a great companion to this show.

1346
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:10,780
And of course, when we do an IPFS special

1347
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:13,300
or an extra or whatever, and this here show.

1348
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,460
You could also become a member at jupiter.signal

1349
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:16,300
and support us that way.

1350
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:19,340
And you get access to all the shows on the network,

1351
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:22,180
ad free, the extended LUP recording,

1352
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:26,500
self-hosted post-show and much more at jupiter.party.

1353
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,980
I think that's what it is.

1354
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:30,020
Come party with us at jupiter.party.

1355
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:30,840
There you go.

1356
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,500
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1357
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:34,820
That's pretty good.

1358
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:35,660
Okay.

1359
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:36,480
All right.

1360
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,320
See you back here next time.

1361
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:57,320
We'll see you back here next time.
