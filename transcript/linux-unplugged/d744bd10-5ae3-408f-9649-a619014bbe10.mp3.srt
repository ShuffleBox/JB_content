1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
Chris, have you heard the good news?

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,140
KDE's working on modernizing Kate, their text editor.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,340
Oh yeah, I love Kate.

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,180
It's great.

5
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,260
So what does modernizing it mean though?

6
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,580
What does a text editor need?

7
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:14,400
Okay, well, they say they wanna make it more like Atom.

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,320
Does that mean they're rewriting it in Electron?

9
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,160
Let's hope not.

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:30,160
Hello friends and welcome into Linux Unplugged 3.18. My name is Chris.

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,000
My name is Wes.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,120
Hello, Wes. Big show.

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,840
Huge show. Too big, maybe.

14
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,140
I know, it's an oversized show. We got an oversized load.

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,340
We're one of those podcasts going down the road right now and we have somebody ahead of us and behind of us saying,

16
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,760
Hey, this podcast is too big.

17
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,300
Wildly swerving all around.

18
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,060
That's how it goes.

19
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:45,560
Yeah.

20
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:54,800
Well, coming up, we'll have some really interesting community news as well as Phil, one of the co-founders of Manjaro will be joining us to talk about their big announcement.

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:02,640
They're going and really taking Manjaro to what would probably be described as an entirely new era for the distribution.

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,640
It's a big deal, so he'll be on in just a little bit.

23
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:14,720
We have a little bit of news we want to share ourselves this week and then something big is happening for Chromebooks that melts my brain a little bit.

24
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:24,520
In the beta channel right now, on Chrome OS, you can choose between Debian, Ubuntu or Fedora for your Linux user land.

25
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,100
And once you choose that, you get the full stack.

26
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:32,980
You get the package manager, you can install applications, even graphical ones, they get added to the Chrome OS launcher.

27
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,280
It's a full integration story, Wes.

28
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,580
Can you say a year of the Linux desktop, anyone?

29
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:43,540
So we thought, let's go back in time to the origination, the launch of Chrome OS.

30
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,540
How it all began.

31
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:48,720
And we'll cover that a little bit and then talk about this huge change.

32
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,360
But before we get any further, we've got to say good morning to Cheesy.

33
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,120
Hello, Cheese.

34
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,120
Hello, Internet.

35
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,620
How are you?

36
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,120
Hello.

37
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,000
Good, good.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,360
And time appropriate greetings to our virtual lug.

39
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,560
Hello, Mumble Room.

40
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,560
Happy Linux.

41
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,060
Happy Linux Tuesday, everyone.

42
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,760
Happy Linux Tuesday to you too, Jill.

43
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:12,000
Hello to Brent and Bruce and Byte and Al and Jill and Lord Desk and Minimech and TechMav, Alt, so that he might have a goatee.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,180
And of course, Turf is in there too, and we start out with something pretty fun.

45
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:25,380
We got a package that arrived in the studio this week, and I'm looking at that box, Wes, and I'm thinking that's something from System76.

46
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,180
Sure looks like it.

47
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,060
Do you want to do a live unboxing here on the show?

48
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,260
I mean, I've been having to resist opening it up all day.

49
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,000
All right, Wes Payne, let's do it.

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,900
Come on now, get to that big box.

51
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:40,100
Inside this, it looks like it's shaped like he's really going at it.

52
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:40,900
You're really excited.

53
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,100
There's no time to waste.

54
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,900
He's been waiting for this.

55
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,700
What are you seeing, Wes?

56
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,440
Okay, well, their characteristic lovely interior box art, that's of course here.

57
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,380
Oh, oh, they've got good instructions, and I see a beefy rig.

58
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,120
Yeah, that's right.

59
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:01,220
Ladies and gentlemen, in the box from System76 arriving in the studio is one of their Adder workstation laptops.

60
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:06,060
It's well packaged in that there's a lot of plastic between me and it that I'm currently working on getting through.

61
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:11,600
So what's neat about that is you can fold it such and that plastic gives, and it makes it really easy to do recycling too.

62
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:17,600
So you can pull that cardboard out, you let the bottoms out, and it releases the plastic and the laptop slides right out.

63
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,940
It's a really clever packaging system that they have.

64
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:26,380
So the Adder workstation is a laptop that they say is really built for content creators, researchers, and gamers.

65
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,980
It's a 15-inch large screen.

66
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:33,180
It's got an RTX 2070 in it, an eight-core Intel i9 CPU.

67
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,820
So we'll see what we got here.

68
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,260
Oh, yeah, there you go.

69
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,020
You got it out.

70
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,260
It's free.

71
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,560
What's the first impressions?

72
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,800
It's thick, but it's not huge for something this massive.

73
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,500
Yeah, it looks like some solid speakers right there underneath.

74
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,300
That stands out.

75
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,100
And you know, not as many ports as I might have expected.

76
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:51,940
Well, check the back.

77
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,140
One of the things they do is they put a lot of the big ports in the back,

78
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,540
which I think that's an old tradition that should have never gone away.

79
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,940
Power cord, HDMI port, it's all in the back.

80
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,940
So your big cables are not side to side, and I really like that.

81
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,460
Yeah, nice looking keyboard, good depth of travel on the keys, at least it feels like so far.

82
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,780
Yeah, and that screen is looking good.

83
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,060
So we'll give this the full kick of the tires.

84
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,820
If you have any suggestions or questions about a workstation laptop like this, let us know.

85
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,500
Tweet me at chrisles or go to linuxunplug.com slash contact and send your questions.

86
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:29,380
And so we're sending that to the lab now to kick it off and see how it performs.

87
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,780
What the hell is that?

88
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,220
That's the sound from the lab.

89
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,580
Is that a truck?

90
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,660
We'll let that go.

91
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,660
We'll let that pass.

92
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:43,260
Are we planning to benchmark this through the test suite or something like that to kind of see where we're at on it?

93
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:43,700
Oh, yes.

94
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,420
One of the things I've done, Cheesy, is I've benchmarked, you know, the machines that have been in here over the years,

95
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,620
but also all of our studio machines.

96
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,540
So it's really cool.

97
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,900
I can compare how systems that come in due to previous systems we reviewed,

98
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,860
but also how they compare just to our existing boxes.

99
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:03,060
So I can get an idea of like if we were to, say, replace a studio production machine with this piece of hardware,

100
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,620
we could see this level of improvement.

101
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,140
That's pretty fun because we have some monster systems in here.

102
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:12,220
So it's always interesting to see where they'll sort of rate on the leaderboard, if you will.

103
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,380
Now, what do you say we get into a little community news here, Wes Payne?

104
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,300
It's about time.

105
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:25,220
The one that I think a lot of people were surprised by in the community this week was Richard Stallman at the Microsoft Redmond campus giving a talk.

106
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:32,940
Yes, Microsoft invited the free software legend, Richard Stallman, to speak at the Microsoft Research Headquarters this week.

107
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:39,300
Microsoft Azure's Chief Technology Officer, Mark Razinovich, tweeted earlier this week, September 5th,

108
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:45,660
that Richard Stallman visited the campus and gave a talk at the Microsoft Research Lab.

109
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,500
Yeah, we've got a few inside details from someone at Microsoft.

110
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,100
He basically said Stallman gave a standard talk, you know, covering the importance of free software.

111
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,260
GPL version 3, GNU versus Linux.

112
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:02,340
Although it sounds like he also had a list of what he called small requests.

113
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:08,180
Make GitHub push users to use better software license hygiene, make hardware manufacturers publish their hardware specs,

114
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,860
and last but not least, make it easier to work around secure boot.

115
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,380
I like that one still on the list.

116
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,780
Yeah, I think the rest of us forgot about it.

117
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,660
Yeah, I did kind of move on.

118
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,620
But RMS never forgets.

119
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,780
He's like a dog with a bone on that kind of stuff.

120
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,660
He really like, he'll follow a cause to the end.

121
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,100
Get it out of here.

122
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:33,100
Also in Microsoft news, the first Windows subsystem for Linux conference has been announced.

123
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,220
That's how you know it's real.

124
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,540
It's actually taking place right in our neck of the woods, Chris.

125
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:43,940
It's going to be March 10th and 11th, 2020 at Building 20 on the Microsoft HQ in Redmond, Washington.

126
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:48,940
Now, it's still coming together, but we already know it's going to have presentations from Penguin,

127
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:54,740
Whitewater's Linux for Windows, of course, Microsoft's Windows subsystem for Linux team, and some folks from Canonical.

128
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,180
Hmm.

129
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,580
Guess what, too.

130
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,260
Rumor has it Westpane's going to be there as well.

131
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:00,860
I think I just went.

132
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,700
As well as myself.

133
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:07,340
Yeah, I've already talked with Hayden Barnes, the founder of Whitewater Foundry,

134
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,780
and he's one of the individuals working on this, and he would love to have you guys there.

135
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,300
And previous guests on the show.

136
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:17,820
And it's just a run down the old freeway for us, really.

137
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,260
It'll be interesting to see this sort of newer community of users take shape, right?

138
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,140
I mean, this is all kind of out in the open.

139
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:23,860
It's happening.

140
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,020
A lot of it's based on an open source, but it's a new generation.

141
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:33,260
Yeah, it was pretty surprising when I emailed their PR and I got a response back from Hayden himself, like, oh, well, OK, great.

142
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,780
It's really cool to see this becoming super serious, too.

143
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:41,220
I have a sense that it's no coincidence that Canonical's name is on that list.

144
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,620
I think they're taking it more seriously, too.

145
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,900
So we'll see where that goes in the future.

146
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:50,740
But this week, there's one story I think that really got people's attention.

147
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,260
Pretty big deal for a little Linux distro that could.

148
00:07:54,260 --> 00:08:01,060
It started out as an alternative to Arch, and now it's really developed into some favorite desktop Linux.

149
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:05,540
Well, this week, Manjaro announced that they're taking the next step.

150
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,460
Phil joins us.

151
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,820
He is one of the co-founders of Manjaro.

152
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:15,420
He was there when it was a hobby project, and now he's here to join us to talk about this big announcement.

153
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,060
Phil, welcome back to the show.

154
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:17,900
Hello.

155
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:22,420
Hello, sir, and congratulations on the big announcement.

156
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:30,900
Yes, it was pretty big and a lot of effort went into that and a lot of man hours as well.

157
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,300
And finally, we're there.

158
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:42,460
I imagine it takes many months of effort behind the scenes to get a company established, to make agreements with certain parties and work out details.

159
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,060
This must have been an area of some focus.

160
00:08:45,060 --> 00:09:01,580
Sure, we had a lot of airplane tickets, hotel stays and business talks with several people over there, even with lawyers and accountants and whatever is needed to get a company started.

161
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,140
So this has been in the works for a while.

162
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:12,260
My first thoughts from the headlines of this is what we're getting out of this is some more full time free software developers.

163
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,500
How many people are getting employed as part of this?

164
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,340
Well, at the start, it's two people.

165
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:23,940
One is Bernard Landauer, who is from Austria, and a second, it's me.

166
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:32,420
So we are becoming the heads of the company, both acting as CEOs, and from then we will see who we employ.

167
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,820
Now, a little little tease right now in the books.

168
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,820
We plan to have Bernard on next week to follow up on another topic.

169
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:43,140
But while we have you, Phil, I know Blue Systems is involved to some level.

170
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,140
Can you share like what their involvement is?

171
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:50,700
Well, they are our advisor and helped us to create a company.

172
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:56,900
And as you know, Blue Systems is in all areas of open source and we are proud to have them on board.

173
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,700
Yeah, they seem like they have taken on helping a lot of projects.

174
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,020
And this is another great one on their list now.

175
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:11,900
Also, I believe some aspects of the Linux Foundation are involved, like as far as donation transparencies and some of those tools, correct?

176
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:16,740
Yes, it's thanks to Jonathan, who is one of our community leaders.

177
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:21,940
He is gaining to secure all the donations we gained so far.

178
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:30,700
So in the past, it's me who is taking the risk and the full responsibility for all the donations collected by the project.

179
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:40,380
And now it's the perfect time to give that over to nonprofit organizations like Open Collective or the Linux Foundation, in this case, the Community Bridge.

180
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:44,860
OK, so there's been some confusion in the early reporting around this.

181
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,420
So I kind of want to make sure we get the details about this.

182
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,060
So what is the story?

183
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:55,380
Because there's, I think, confusion about where existing donations are going and these types of things.

184
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,700
Well, in the past, it's on my personal bank account.

185
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,580
So we couldn't give you tax deductions and such things.

186
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:19,380
And the confusion might be because our company has a chipperish name like GIMBihar and Kokage, which is in UK terms LLP, if that is a thing which helps you out.

187
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:26,660
And people think it's nonprofit, as Gartner and Lunduk says before on a YouTube channel.

188
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,540
But we are a full spectrum profit company now.

189
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:36,100
All right. And that's good to be clear about because, A, it's good to know what the donations go towards.

190
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:40,380
But also, B, it means that in the future, it gives you avenues to explore.

191
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:49,020
I mean, I'm just speculating, but other commercial ventures as well that are outside the core distribution itself, but perhaps hardware partnerships or other ventures, right?

192
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:55,460
Right. So we are in talks with several other partnerships, also hardware vendors already,

193
00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:02,660
which will be exploring the ARM and the standard Intel AMD area as well.

194
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,100
I'd love to know more about that when it gets closer.

195
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:10,380
OK, so what happens to existing donations like, say, the Patreon right now?

196
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,300
Where does that go away?

197
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,220
Do they get directed towards the company?

198
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,340
What happens in the future with that kind of stuff?

199
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,180
Actually, I don't know of any patron.

200
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:23,100
So if we have some patron, then some of the community has created that on their own.

201
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,500
But it's not related to us. There is a page.

202
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,500
Really? It's for the ARM community.

203
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,180
All right. There's a managerial arm.

204
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,460
They have it. They have it.

205
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,620
It's a sister project.

206
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:37,420
It's leaded by Dan, and Dan explored a lot of opportunities.

207
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:41,300
And if Patreon is one of them, sure, go for them.

208
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,300
I think they have also an open collective one beside us.

209
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,940
So let's say they explored a little bit earlier what they can do.

210
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:53,500
But in the end, the main project will support ARM as well.

211
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,660
So, yeah, if we have a patron, then sure.

212
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,820
That goes towards those efforts there individually.

213
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,300
That makes sense. Right.

214
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,580
So I guess I just kind of wanted to shift gears to a personal side of this.

215
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:10,180
This this must be a huge moment for you to take something that's been a passion project

216
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:17,620
and convert it to a legitimate business with transparency towards funding and be a full time job.

217
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,740
And I just kind of wanted to get your your state of mind on all of this right now.

218
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:28,740
Well, in the past, I was in sales, so I know all about how to get a business started and such.

219
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:33,020
So I actually learned that. Past then, I went to I.T.

220
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:41,140
I worked for big companies like BMW, Audi and other automotive companies in the past for several years.

221
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:51,140
And the last was for public relations or the public industry, where it's like more slow down to relax a little bit.

222
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:54,740
But my main project was always Manchara on site.

223
00:13:54,740 --> 00:14:03,900
And there was a point where I said, OK, is there a way to get it to main job or the main task as I do it anyway,

224
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:10,340
to have more free time for other things? And with Blue Systems, we got that chance and we took it.

225
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:15,060
Congratulations. I remember that moment when I was able to take my my passion,

226
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:19,260
the thing I really worked on and push it over into the full time employment threshold.

227
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:23,260
And it's a it's a big moment. And you realize that once you get your feet underneath you,

228
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,300
there's a lot of opportunity that opens up.

229
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,580
It could mean fascinating things for the future of the project.

230
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:35,220
And I wonder if you think it also isn't a bit of a statement of the popularity of both the distribution,

231
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,420
but also desktop Linux itself.

232
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:43,940
Yeah, we are we are a community centric and that is always community first.

233
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:47,100
And we want to keep that as that way.

234
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,100
Sure, we have to make our decisions in the commercial part of the entity.

235
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,580
But for the community itself, Manchara will always be free.

236
00:14:54,580 --> 00:15:00,500
We'll always gain the updates, as you know, and now we'll get more supportive.

237
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:06,740
And if a company is interested in some business support, we are not able to do that.

238
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,980
So it's a more win win situation for that.

239
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,420
What a moment. What a what a great moment.

240
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:16,060
And like I said earlier, it means more people working on free software.

241
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,060
So that's great.

242
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,100
It really solidifies the distribution, right?

243
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,420
Yeah, Manchara is here to stay.

244
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,300
Yeah, really, it's a it's a big moment.

245
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:27,260
It's like a it's reaching another threshold of legitimacy in the distribution world.

246
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,820
And I'm just really thrilled for you guys.

247
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:36,380
And I think what we're going to do after this call is we're going to, for a week,

248
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,580
try to get all of our work done on Manchara.

249
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,980
You ready? Oh, yeah, let's do it.

250
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,180
I mean, there's a USB right here.

251
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,820
I'll just get a burn today.

252
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,940
All right. So we'll report back in the next episode and see how it goes.

253
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,460
You've in fact, you've inspired us with all of this, Phil.

254
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:53,100
Yeah, it's always like we started an operating system.

255
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,460
What was useful for us?

256
00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:02,340
More people come to the to the group and started to develop some tools like Pamac

257
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:09,820
or the Manchara hardware tools and other tools which make the life of everyone

258
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,980
using Linux in general easier.

259
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:17,860
And our tools were always UI driven, so easy to use.

260
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:23,740
And we see a lot of Windows user enjoying Linux and some of them coming to Manchara.

261
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,420
So it's a plus.

262
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,900
And we all see that also in the forum.

263
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,620
So when we announced we are a company, we actually crashed it.

264
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:36,980
So we are now currently working on getting a better server,

265
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:42,780
more horsepower to compensate everybody's going to the beloved forum

266
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,780
and gain their knowledge out of it.

267
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:47,220
That must be a big part of the mission ahead, right?

268
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,060
Is factoring in some infrastructure improvements over time.

269
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:53,340
I think I saw you mentioned some of that in the announcement.

270
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:58,620
Sure. One of the things we plan is more continuous integration.

271
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:04,060
So all our ISOs we produce should be automatically tested,

272
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,700
which gain also more quality itself.

273
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,220
That's great.

274
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:11,300
And we can produce them faster in a more related way.

275
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,860
That is really great.

276
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:17,780
I think this also reflects a great kind of common thing that happens in open source

277
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,540
and a great kind of like, will it make it or will it not kind of make it story?

278
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,460
A project starts out and you'll hear common myths come up about a project.

279
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,980
Oh, it's it's just it's delayed arch.

280
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:33,540
And then and it's like this is this really kind of sum the whole thing down to one variable

281
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,540
and dismiss it kind of argument.

282
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,340
And people people will just stick to that for a long time.

283
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,660
But you guys stuck to it.

284
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,500
You clearly had a vision and you followed it.

285
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,700
You made you made choices like we recently had that conversation around free office

286
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,340
that pushed the distribution forward in certain areas.

287
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,740
And you make compromises when you feel like the community made a good point.

288
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:59,420
And so by sticking to that vision, by making something that truly solve problems for people

289
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:04,820
and by working with the community when they made a fair point and compromising,

290
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:08,860
I think you've you've kind of come on something special and unique.

291
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:12,100
And it's it's I think it's reflected in this as well.

292
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:16,660
Well, Phil, again, congratulations and look forward to seeing where the project goes next.

293
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,300
This is this is the beginning of a whole new era.

294
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,660
Sure. And hope we'll talk to you soon.

295
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:26,100
Now that we've chatted with Phil, I think next week we'll get a chance to chat with Bernard.

296
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,100
Oh, looking forward to it.

297
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,820
And we'll have Ran Mangiero.

298
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,900
I'm going to try out some of the community edition stuff.

299
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,420
I think it's going to be we sure do love making promises for ourselves.

300
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,900
I know we like throwing we like throwing work at it like but at least it's fun.

301
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,020
And it's been a while since I mean, I'm looking forward to it.

302
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,220
Yeah, same. I'm really excited for them.

303
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,500
You know, more people working on free software is always good.

304
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,060
Absolutely. And, you know, in the past, we've kind of talked about how do you make, you know,

305
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,380
these distros that we worry about?

306
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,660
Do we have too many distributions?

307
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:54,420
Are they just sort of small, independent people working on an operation?

308
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:58,820
This is a big step, solidifying them, showing that Mangiero is serious about being around

309
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,820
for a long time.

310
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:04,420
Yeah, they'll be here for a while, which I think is probably the biggest takeaway from

311
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,420
that story.

312
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,420
All right.

313
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,300
Well, let's make a little news ourselves.

314
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,460
We like to do that every now and then.

315
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:17,900
I am pretty excited to say time goes by really fast when you're having fun.

316
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:22,820
This Thursday will be our one year anniversary with Linux Academy.

317
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:26,140
Isn't that something?

318
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:30,780
Does it feel like it's been that long?

319
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,780
No, not really.

320
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:36,260
I mean, it's a weird mix of it just happened and it's been this way forever and no idea

321
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,740
how long it's been.

322
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,740
Right.

323
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,780
Which means it's been just over a bit of a year for Elle at Linux Academy.

324
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,380
So happy birthday, belated birthday to you too Elle.

325
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,740
Thank you very much.

326
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:49,860
So we are celebrating with the launch of Self-Hosted.

327
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,540
It's sort of a reverse birthday thing.

328
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,540
We give you presents.

329
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,540
That's how it works in the internet, man.

330
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,500
That's definitely how it works.

331
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:01,540
Self-Hosted launches episode one on Thursday the 12th.

332
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:08,660
Self-Hosted has probably some of the most experience we've ever, as a team, we all went

333
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,660
through a sprint.

334
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:14,820
We've really thought a lot about this and it's been a really, really rewarding process

335
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:22,580
and a huge shift for me because before this merger, a lot of times all of the creative

336
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,180
decisions were unilaterally just made by me.

337
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,180
Right.

338
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:29,780
I mean, you're the guy running the whole thing.

339
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:37,140
The idea of Tech Talk today from concept to launch happened in two hours on a Monday.

340
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,020
Wow.

341
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:42,700
On the drive to work, I got there and I was like, hey, Rekai, do you think we could do

342
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,700
this?

343
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,020
I was like, what if we did this?

344
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,020
What if we did this?

345
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:50,620
Then the next thing was like, hey, Enj, can you have somebody go get us some art?

346
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,340
The whole thing just kind of just snowballs, right?

347
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:57,140
But now we're much more deliberate because we want to measure twice and cut once.

348
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,980
We know we're going to put a lot of effort into whatever we decide to make, right?

349
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,980
We've got to get it right.

350
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,140
It's a real commitment, right?

351
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,500
Really Self-Hosted is our show where you can discover software and hardware to get the

352
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,860
most out of the devices on your network.

353
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:13,580
Control your smart devices, build things offline, take things that are available in the cloud

354
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,660
and build them for yourself using open source software.

355
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:20,220
But use the cloud, leverage it where it's appropriate, where it makes sense.

356
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:23,820
Being able to integrate, use the abilities that are there, but make sure that you stay

357
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,820
in control.

358
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,820
Exactly.

359
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,820
That's really the key of it.

360
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,120
So I'm very excited about Self-Hosted.

361
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,520
Episode one is this Thursday, it's Alex and myself.

362
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,700
And then episode two, it's a twice a month podcast because we know there's a lot of shows

363
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,740
out there.

364
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:40,060
So we're trying to make really good shows and not overwhelm you.

365
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,460
And there's always room for things to increase.

366
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,820
But we wanted to make sure that we really got this right, gave ourselves time to work

367
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:46,820
on it.

368
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:52,940
So then episode two with Wendell from Level One Text comes out on Thursday the 24th, if

369
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,940
I'm doing my date math right.

370
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,940
I think you are.

371
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,660
So it's every other Thursday, self-hosted.show slash subscribe.

372
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,300
If you want to get it, it'll be out this Thursday.

373
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,700
Oh man, launching a new show.

374
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,100
There's really nothing like it.

375
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,100
Good job, everybody.

376
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:10,500
Now, what if we wanted to ask questions, say we had our own Self-Hosted questions and we

377
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,780
wanted to direct them to you guys to possibly address on the show?

378
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,780
How would we do that?

379
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,780
Why cheesy?

380
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,780
That's such a great question.

381
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:22,140
You could tweet them at us with a hashtag ask SSH or a telegram and put that in there

382
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,260
in the telegram message and we'll get in a future show.

383
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,260
Awesome.

384
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,260
So yeah, that's something we'll be doing.

385
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,260
Thank you for bringing that up.

386
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,860
Plus, there's also the contact page, self-hosted.show slash contact.

387
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:35,020
But what if we wanted to launch two shows this week?

388
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,020
No, that's crazy.

389
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,020
That's crazy.

390
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,020
Now we're going to do it.

391
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,360
Actually, we've decided we're launching two shows.

392
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,420
There's another show we're launching that we haven't told you about.

393
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,340
It's actually already launched.

394
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,940
Two episodes are out already as we record this.

395
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,940
Look at this.

396
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,940
Isn't this fun?

397
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,940
LinuxHeadlines.show.

398
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,940
LinuxHeadlines.show.

399
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:58,820
Linux and open source headlines every weekday in under three minutes.

400
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,820
How about that?

401
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,820
That's it.

402
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,820
That's the show.

403
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:05,020
Ladies and gentlemen, very excited about the new project.

404
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:08,640
I think I got to do an extras episode that tells the history of this.

405
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,380
But this is something we have been trying to crack this formula since before the merger.

406
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,380
Oh, yeah.

407
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,380
A long time.

408
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:18,940
It's something that Joe and I kicked around for a very, very long time.

409
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,860
We've done internal pilots that we've canceled.

410
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,340
But now we've decided to really go into this and really commit.

411
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,300
So we're launching two new shows this week.

412
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:32,580
Check out LinuxHeadlines.show every weekday, the headlines you care about in three minutes

413
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,580
or less.

414
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,740
It really is a testament to how much has changed and the great support from Linux Academy that

415
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,820
we actually have the ability to do this and feel like we can get it right and launch two

416
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,820
shows in a single week.

417
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,460
Yeah, we have a whole team behind us.

418
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,460
It really makes a difference.

419
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,460
It really does.

420
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,860
And the idea here is you can get just the headlines.

421
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,580
You pop it on before you listen to a longer show.

422
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:54,280
We're going to target it for an afternoon drive release.

423
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,600
So we closely monitor the news.

424
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,380
And then we have a process we go through to select which goes into the headlines and we'll

425
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:04,580
try to get it out for your afternoon drive on the East Coast.

426
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,820
How great.

427
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,820
Are you excited?

428
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,820
Are you busy at work all day?

429
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,580
You just check in and go subscribe.

430
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,580
Yeah.

431
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,140
And we'll publish to the Smart Tubes as well.

432
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:15,260
So you'll get it as part of your flash briefing if you like.

433
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,900
That's all in the process right now.

434
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,020
It works great in that capacity.

435
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:22,060
And of course, we're putting everything we know to try to make it sound good.

436
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:27,860
So it's a good sounding, clean, crisp, tight show with links for more information if you

437
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,300
want to read it like we always do.

438
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,300
Of course.

439
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:34,480
You guys know we got a minimum standard we're going to meet and it's going to be great.

440
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,580
So we are now in a position where we've got Linux Unplugged that covers the community

441
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,580
stories.

442
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,580
The ones we can really get something going about.

443
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,580
Something we could chew on.

444
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,580
A nice conversation.

445
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:46,940
Then you got Linux Action News, which covers the stories in Linux and open source every

446
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:51,380
week that really need analysis, that need further discussion.

447
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:56,220
And that's five or six headlines that we've got further expansion and a lot of research.

448
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,860
We generally have contacted people involved with the stories.

449
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,860
Good analysis.

450
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,320
Keeping you up with threads that happen over time.

451
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,460
And then Headlines keeps you current on the daily updates in the Linux and open source

452
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,460
world.

453
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,460
Right there.

454
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:13,860
And I just I feel like we've really come up with something great.

455
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,900
We've boiled it down to the essential thing you need just to get in and get out.

456
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,900
We're not wasting your time.

457
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,900
Yeah.

458
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,900
Not a bunch of fluff or anything.

459
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,800
And we try to make sure, you know, we're human.

460
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,800
So we're still learning.

461
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,460
But we try to make sure we have something really good out of the gate.

462
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,220
We've been practicing for a little bit and I think we got it.

463
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,540
I think we do.

464
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:32,220
Linux Headlines dot show slash subscribe to get that RSS feed.

465
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,220
I am so thrilled.

466
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,940
We've been trying to crack the daily show format for a long time.

467
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,100
You know, there's a lot of different ways you can go.

468
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:44,520
You can overdo it with campy music and and trying to like emulate radio and you can underdeliver

469
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:48,940
by being too dry and too boring and you want to have some insights into what the audience

470
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,660
is interested in.

471
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:55,420
And so it's a big it's a big problem domain to solve and do it right.

472
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,060
Linux Headlines dot show.

473
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,260
Go check it out.

474
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,260
Very proud.

475
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,660
And self hosted dot show.

476
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,620
First episode comes out on Thursday.

477
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,880
Linux Headlines already publishing.

478
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,860
We started publishing on Monday.

479
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,820
So if you got six minutes, you can get all caught up.

480
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,820
It's easy.

481
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,820
It's easy.

482
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,820
It's really great.

483
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,820
It's and that's the great thing, too.

484
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,820
It's like it's not impossible just to get on the ground floor on both these shows.

485
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,400
Self Hosted is coming out twice a month.

486
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,300
So that's not going to overwhelm you.

487
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,100
And Linux Headlines is three minutes.

488
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:26,380
So it's I appreciate that there's a lot to listen to this day these days.

489
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,380
Right.

490
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,380
We do.

491
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,380
We do.

492
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,380
We very much do.

493
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,380
But we responded accordingly.

494
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,980
We're trying to make something that's still consumable and worth your time.

495
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,900
And of course, we'll have links in the show notes to it.

496
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,300
Linux on plug dot com slash three eighteen.

497
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,020
Big pat on the back for everybody.

498
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,560
Everybody on the team.

499
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,660
We've been really we've been whittling away at this problem.

500
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:50,100
And sometimes, you know, like we had a few ideas that we really loved.

501
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:54,180
We what we were like ready to publish really close and we had to say, no, it's not good

502
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,180
enough.

503
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,180
Just got to get it right.

504
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,180
Pretty excited.

505
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:00,540
Linux Headlines dot show and self hosted dot show.

506
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:07,820
Now, before we get into our Chrome OS discussion and we haven't even mentioned the machine

507
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:12,180
that we put this Frankenstein Chrome OS install on.

508
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,180
Yeah, you're right.

509
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,180
There's a certain.

510
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,180
We'll have to get to that.

511
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,180
But let's do a little housekeeping.

512
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,740
There's some good things to cover here.

513
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,900
First of all, new audio stream.

514
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,540
We had some troubles with our JBLive dot FM.

515
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:26,500
So if you want to tune into this year show live or any of our live shows, JBLive dot

516
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,100
stream now, they'll take you right to the M3U file.

517
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,100
Yeah.

518
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,100
High quality, low latency.

519
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,100
Boom.

520
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,100
Right in your ears.

521
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,100
I like it.

522
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:38,140
You could be like the you should do like a slogan that we play on the live show.

523
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,140
Yeah.

524
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,140
Right.

525
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,140
Each time it starts up.

526
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,140
You're listening to JBLive dot stream.

527
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,140
High quality, low latency.

528
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,140
Right in your ears.

529
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,140
Coming up.

530
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,140
I kind of like that, dude.

531
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,140
I think maybe you should do it there, Chris.

532
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:53,820
Anyway, so we're trying to get the FM URL working because it's hard coded into some

533
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,820
apps and stuff.

534
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:59,900
So JBLive dot stream, pop that in your browser VLC and it'll play the audio stream for you.

535
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:03,740
It's going 24 seven, but we do this show live on Tuesdays at 2 p.m.

536
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,740
Pacific.

537
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,460
So if you want to join us, JBLive dot stream and it's Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash

538
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,180
calendar to get that converted in your time zone.

539
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:17,000
Quick reminder, new courses in the month of September and details about those courses

540
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,300
will have linked in the show notes.

541
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:24,140
And another thing to keep on your radar, Texas Cyber Summit is coming up.

542
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:27,500
It's coming up and there's the Be New track.

543
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,200
What should we plug about Texas Cyber Summit this week, Elle?

544
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,200
We're going to be there.

545
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,200
That's worth mentioning.

546
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:37,740
There is so much going on that it's hard to just kind of focus on one thing.

547
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:41,300
But the one thing that I really want to announce is the fact that we're going to be doing some

548
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:47,020
ticket giveaways for people to kind of stay tuned and come and join us and have a great

549
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,580
time at the conference and the birthday party.

550
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,580
Absolutely.

551
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,580
The birthday party, too.

552
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,580
Details about that.

553
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:56,860
It's Jupiter broadcasting, Texas Cyber Summit, October 10th through the 12th at the Grand

554
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,860
Hyatt.

555
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,860
Should be a great time.

556
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,860
It should be.

557
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,860
It's been a little while since we've been to Texas.

558
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,860
I know.

559
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:02,860
We're missing it.

560
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,860
You know, we're going to be going just as it starts getting real crappy here.

561
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,860
So that's good timing.

562
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,860
Escape.

563
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,860
Yeah, that will be.

564
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,740
Then we come back and it's like, even worse.

565
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,740
Crap.

566
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,740
That's true.

567
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,640
There's also a Texas Cyber Summit telegram group.

568
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,560
If you want to get on that business, we have that linked in the show notes as well.

569
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:24,200
So get all of that Linux Unplugged dot com slash 318.

570
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,180
That's everything for the housekeeping.

571
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:34,520
Boy, Chrome OS really does seem like it's becoming the de facto desktop Linux, because

572
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:41,700
if you go by definitions of years past to be a to be desktop Linux, quote unquote, we

573
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,420
threw out a lot of definitions and there's a couple that really stuck.

574
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:49,740
One, you should be able to go to like your big box consumer store and buy a laptop with

575
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,900
it running on there.

576
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,900
Right.

577
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,900
Absolutely.

578
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,900
Chrome OS meets that criteria.

579
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,900
No doubt about it.

580
00:29:54,900 --> 00:30:00,300
But one that Wimpy threw out a while back in the past, episode two hundred and ninety

581
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:06,340
six of this here show at thirty seven minutes into the show, Wimpy mentions that to be truly

582
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:10,940
a desktop Linux operating system, you need to have the ability to download the source

583
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:15,660
code of the kernel and compile it and install it and reboot and load it yourself.

584
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:20,620
That we weren't so sure if Chrome OS was going to meet that particular criteria, but that

585
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,100
may be up for some debate now.

586
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:29,020
So before we go too far into this, I want to go back in time, if you will allow us,

587
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:36,700
go way back in time to the Linux Action Show in 2011, Brian and I were covering a Google

588
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:43,540
I.O. keynote, one of their early ones, and Chrome OS had been announced and we were trying

589
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,100
to figure out what to make of this.

590
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,100
All right.

591
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,580
So here's the one that I think we'll touch on first is now Chrome OS, because that's

592
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,580
that's Linux.

593
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,580
That's a Linux machine.

594
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:56,900
And so Chrome OS, I got a bit of a bit of a fanfare at Google I.O. and one of the things

595
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,860
that I thought was interesting is was it Sergey, right?

596
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:04,220
One of the Sergey Brin, the head dude now over there at Google, came out and said that

597
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:08,420
one of the reasons they're launching Chrome OS is because standard desktop operating systems,

598
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:13,420
Windows implied, standard desktop OSes are torturing users.

599
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,000
Torturing users, Wes.

600
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,860
That's what past Chris said, outstanding.

601
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,380
That's a strong sell.

602
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:23,180
And now when and keep in mind, when Chrome OS launched, it was a totally different thing.

603
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:27,560
Now it's capable of running desktop applications from Linux.

604
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,520
Chrome itself can do much more.

605
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,040
The Web is much more capable.

606
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,040
Connectivity is more common.

607
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:41,020
In 2011, Wi-Fi was just simply not as prevalent as it is today in the States.

608
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:46,660
Just about every kind of medium sized town will have some coffee shop with Wi-Fi.

609
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,660
Right.

610
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:51,860
I mean, the limitations have become less and Chrome OS has grown a lot of new abilities.

611
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,860
Exactly.

612
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,620
And Google has grown in influence.

613
00:31:55,620 --> 00:32:00,060
So it's been it's been something to watch Chrome OS over the years go from toy that

614
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,580
we kind of mocked a little bit.

615
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,420
When you watch that full episode, we're pretty harsh on it.

616
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:10,820
We mock the 100 megabytes of data bandwidth allocation.

617
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:13,120
We mock the lack of storage.

618
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,580
We mock the idea that you'd ever use something in the Web when you're offline.

619
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,980
Like, we really kind of have a go at it.

620
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:23,360
And while I actually feel like the criticisms that are brought up in that 2011 episode are

621
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:28,180
still valid today, it's clear it hasn't been a huge barrier for the market.

622
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,180
Right.

623
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:32,100
More of them keep getting made, getting sold and people are using them.

624
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:38,380
And something that I don't think we fully appreciated in 2011 that we now in 2019 just

625
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:42,420
have a foregone conclusion.

626
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,640
Education.

627
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,180
Education changed all of this.

628
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:50,500
I had a conversation with my son because I knew we were going to be talking about this.

629
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,300
He's been issued a Chromebook since the second grade.

630
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,780
He had them in kindergarten, but they were just shared in the classroom.

631
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,420
They would put them back in a storage unit.

632
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,620
But since second grade, he's in fifth grade now.

633
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:03,140
Since second grade, he's had his own assigned Chromebook.

634
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,500
He has signed in with the same Google account.

635
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,500
He has opted to change his password a couple of times, but I'm not even sure that's been

636
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,900
necessary.

637
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:14,020
Talking to him really, it made me realize that where you have institutions where they

638
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:18,980
have scale and they have enterprise grade connectivity, at least close to it, those

639
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:23,780
concerns about the cloud basically almost completely go away.

640
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:29,660
Well, I mean, I can tell you personally that my wife uses Chromebooks in her classroom

641
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:33,620
and they have what they call a Chromebook cart.

642
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:37,700
So all the Chromebooks go back into the cart where they're charged up at the end of the

643
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,700
day.

644
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:43,180
The cart gets pushed against the wall or whatever, or it can be moved to different rooms.

645
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:48,940
She so far loves Google's educational suite.

646
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:56,660
Is it maybe kind of sort of possibly indoctrinating kids to use Chrome OS in the future?

647
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,660
Maybe.

648
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,500
Is that maybe a gateway for them to learn a little bit more about Linux?

649
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,500
Possibly.

650
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:06,060
So, I mean, I think that there's, you know, it's interesting how they've kind of beat

651
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:10,940
some of the other players in that educational market and they're really, they just seem

652
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:14,100
to be going crazy right now in that arena.

653
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:19,100
My instinct on that about the indoctrination is it's a little bit of yes and no.

654
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:23,640
I don't know about you guys, but when I was going to school, Apple was really pushing

655
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,820
in education.

656
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,980
Apple twos were really common in my school.

657
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:32,540
And then later they were replaced by the Macintoshes, the sort of like the post Steve Jobs Macintosh

658
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,000
monster machines.

659
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,180
Our schools were filled with those.

660
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,180
Did you guys have that?

661
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,180
Absolutely.

662
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:42,340
Yeah, I had Macs, but then those were supplanted when Microsoft got into the same game of pushing

663
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,980
Windows PCs into schools everywhere.

664
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,700
So I kind of switched halfway through.

665
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,700
Yes.

666
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,060
Yeah, I witnessed a little, I witnessed, that's a story for an extras one day.

667
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,060
I witnessed quite a thing.

668
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,500
But same sort of thing.

669
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,500
It was a battle.

670
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:58,460
There was a, and even later when I was still in school, but became part of the district

671
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:05,580
IT department, as I did back then, there was a split internally in the IT department between

672
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,700
Mac and Windows.

673
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:10,540
There were the Mac technicians and they were a little arrogant.

674
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:13,820
And then there was the Windows technician and they had contempt for the Mac guys.

675
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,820
Of course.

676
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,940
And it was really something because I was just sort of a universalist.

677
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,840
I didn't really care, just liked technology.

678
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,420
And that was what I was into.

679
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,100
So I was like, you want me to fix a Mac?

680
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,100
That's fine.

681
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,100
You hadn't joined a gang yet.

682
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,100
Really?

683
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,100
You don't mind?

684
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,100
No.

685
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,100
But you fix the Windows computer.

686
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,100
I'm like, yeah, that's fine.

687
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:34,780
Of course, I eventually burned out on fixing the Windows computers.

688
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,140
And now we've burned out on fixing Mac.

689
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,140
So I just stick to Linux.

690
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,140
It is interesting though, right?

691
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:42,440
I mean, in some ways, education makes a lot of sense because you have fewer power users

692
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,900
that have special applications that they need to run or support.

693
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:50,020
And you have less sort of embedded other legacy applications existing.

694
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:54,420
So at least for the students, you can have this sort of fresh idea and actually take

695
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,420
hold.

696
00:35:55,420 --> 00:36:01,260
Well, and from the school district standpoint, you're not dealing with passing around files

697
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:04,620
in a way that is likely to expose the school to malware.

698
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,500
Yeah, it's a lot safer by default.

699
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,500
Right?

700
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,980
Students could take something home, they could get a USB drive infected, especially when

701
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,980
everybody's on Windows.

702
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,340
You know, everybody's heard this story.

703
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,420
Bring it back to the school, school gets the virus.

704
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:18,420
Now you got crypto encrypted, you know, files everywhere.

705
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:23,520
Then additionally, the school district doesn't have to worry about centralized disk storage

706
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,260
for all of the docs and the spreadsheets and the presentations because that's all online

707
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,260
in Google Drive.

708
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:33,260
And so that reduces their investment in server hardware and administration and overhead.

709
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,100
So it's a great ongoing cost.

710
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,360
Yeah, it's a great cost.

711
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,360
It's a big cost for them.

712
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,980
Sure, it's an ongoing cost, but it's great.

713
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:42,620
It's fantastic because we don't have to do all these things.

714
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,140
And at the end of the day, if a Chromebook breaks, it's on warranty.

715
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:47,260
It's on a service contract and we just get it replaced.

716
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:52,220
And we love it when these machines just get swapped out because they'll often just put

717
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,220
the newer version in.

718
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,300
It's great.

719
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,540
It's a pretty good.

720
00:36:55,540 --> 00:37:00,260
And when you're dealing with students who are hard on computers, you don't need a big

721
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,260
expensive machine.

722
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,820
You want something, you know, light and flexible.

723
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:07,700
Well, I mean, I'm curious as to, you know, because it's obvious that the Chromebook's

724
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:11,380
cheaper than Apple's offering with the iPad.

725
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:15,500
And if you're buying these in bulk for an entire district, you've got to be getting

726
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,500
a great deal.

727
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,700
And like you said, tag on the extra services.

728
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:24,100
It's really kind of a no brainer, it seems like for education these days to gravitate

729
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,100
that way.

730
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:30,380
I also think back to the indoctrination point, there is some benefit in just learning the

731
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:35,140
general concepts of like copy and paste and how spreadsheets work and how docs work and

732
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,480
the concept of saving your files.

733
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:42,580
Those are universal concepts that would apply just as equally to LibreOffice and Office

734
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,740
365.

735
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:47,180
So teaching the students those high level concepts that they can then apply to other

736
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,380
UIs is useful.

737
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:55,020
And I have to make this argument because I was the guy advocating to switch the school

738
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:59,740
district to LibreOffice and the parents would come to me and they would say, you can't do

739
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,740
that.

740
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:03,340
Our kids are going to go use Office in the real world.

741
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,860
And so they have to use Office in the schools.

742
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:08,580
And my counter argument was, that's not true.

743
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:13,220
By using LibreOffice, they will learn these fundamentals that they can apply to any software

744
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,220
suite.

745
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,920
Well, flip it around.

746
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,800
Now something else has come in, those things are still true.

747
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,200
And they're going to be interacting with other cloud services.

748
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:26,060
They're certainly going to go to Google to actually search the web.

749
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:29,380
So it's sort of inevitable.

750
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:37,360
One thing I've noticed with my two older kids is it indoctrinates a web-first mentality.

751
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:41,700
So Dylan had a little video project that he wanted to edit and a photo.

752
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:45,020
I think you were here when he wanted to do the Pokemon photo thing.

753
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,540
And he was really struggling using a desktop application.

754
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:51,060
And then I realized, you know what I could do is I could open up Photopea in a web browser

755
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,060
for him.

756
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,060
He'll get this.

757
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,780
And he just, it was like he was back at home.

758
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:58,380
And I'm sitting there one time trying to show him Katie in live and he laughs at me.

759
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:01,580
Oh dad, what are you doing?

760
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,580
Just open up Chrome.

761
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,660
What are you doing?

762
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:07,340
And then of course, because this web one has like all of these like stock search stuff

763
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,340
it can do.

764
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:12,380
So like it can go get the green screen background for him and all of these things that are so

765
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:15,020
much better when you have like infinite search and all this kind of stuff.

766
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:22,780
And I felt like that was probably the biggest side effect of him spending so much time on

767
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:28,340
Chrome OS is even now when he's on his elementary OS laptop, which is a Dell XPS.

768
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,460
He's doing everything in Chrome.

769
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,460
Right.

770
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:34,460
But isn't that true of, you know, adults too now people who aren't into, you know, tinkering

771
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,460
and playing with computers.

772
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:39,440
I mean, most people open Facebook or play some maybe some games on the web.

773
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,620
Check the news, send email.

774
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:46,540
So if this is the common consumer use of Linux, like when you, when you look at all the school

775
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:51,580
uses, when you look at average people that buy them, the fact that you can get them from

776
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:55,000
a store, it's kind of Linux for the masses much like Android was.

777
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,820
And now it's even easier because you, you loaded a project on a very ironic piece of

778
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:01,820
hardware.

779
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:04,660
So tell people about what this is and what machine we put it on.

780
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,660
Yeah.

781
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,660
Okay.

782
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:11,500
So this is cloud ready, which is a distribution basically of Chrome OS or maybe, maybe Chromium,

783
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:15,420
you know, they use the upstream sources for Chromium OS and then build and ship their

784
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,420
own.

785
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:19,880
Now we're using the free edition, but they also provide commercial editions that gets

786
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:24,460
you their support and also integration with all of Google's enterprise management sort

787
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,460
of features.

788
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,620
Take that in for a second.

789
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:32,300
So they are reselling a version of Chromium OS with their commercial support.

790
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:38,060
And the, the appeal is you can essentially install it on any x86 machine.

791
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,060
Yeah.

792
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,940
I mean, it kind of worked just like any other Linux distribution.

793
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,940
Downloaded the file.

794
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:47,940
I used Etcher to write it to a flash drive, got here, booted it up on the Librem 15.

795
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,000
The what?

796
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,900
You know, the Librem 15.

797
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:51,900
Turns out it makes a great Chromebook.

798
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,900
Yeah, it does.

799
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:53,900
Librem 15 really made it great.

800
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:57,540
It took a little bit to get installed, but now it's, it's up and running and we even

801
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:00,540
got the Linux application beta mode enabled.

802
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,540
Yeah.

803
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:04,840
Now that's, that is, oh wow.

804
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:08,420
So this is something I'd really been wanting to try for a really long time.

805
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,560
Two ways to get to it.

806
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:14,660
If you just launch the search, like launcher and type in terminal and hit enter, it just

807
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:18,140
brings up the screen and it says, Hey, do you want to set up a Linux environment?

808
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,260
That's so handy.

809
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:23,880
Or you just in the settings, you can go to Linux in beta, it has in parentheses and start

810
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:29,660
and it loads a Debian 9 environment with the full app repository.

811
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,100
You quickly installed dark table.

812
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,100
Yeah, we got up.

813
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,380
We could just edit photos like any Linux desktop.

814
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:41,780
Chrome OS picks up the dot desktop file, creates a launcher entry for it, the appropriate dark

815
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:46,620
table icon is right there in the Chrome launcher and you're running it.

816
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:50,780
No like weird borders around the window or anything normal.

817
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:54,300
And now the thing they're taking to the next level is they're letting you choose what distro

818
00:41:54,300 --> 00:42:03,500
you want in that environment or perhaps potentially even possibly all of them at once.

819
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,500
Isn't that crazy?

820
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:10,540
Uh, I mean like, am I supposed to be attracted to this?

821
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,740
I don't know.

822
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,460
Is this supposed to be something I'm attracted to?

823
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,460
I can't tell anymore.

824
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:18,740
Well, it is, um, you know, it's, it's kind of on the border lines now because before

825
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:20,540
it was almost like an appliance, right?

826
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,540
Mostly a black box.

827
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,580
You weren't going to tweak it too much.

828
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,820
You used it transactionally.

829
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:24,820
You weren't invested.

830
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,920
That was the entire point of the entire point.

831
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:31,660
And now that's a little less true, but only as much as you want it, right?

832
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:32,900
Cause you can blow this environment away.

833
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,300
You can, all your stuff is still going to be saved to the cloud, right?

834
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,220
You have to share folders into this Linux environment.

835
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:40,020
You don't have to go down these rabbit holes, right?

836
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:44,700
So maybe, you know, I think we've both gone through phases where you, your, your workstation

837
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:49,980
can be both a workstation and sort of a toy, a hobby machine when you're not looking to

838
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:50,980
do that.

839
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:51,980
Right?

840
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,060
This might, this might be perfect.

841
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,060
You know, it's not going to break.

842
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:57,580
You're not going to be able to do an app to get right before the show and have it not

843
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:00,100
loading to show you the show notes, right?

844
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,100
That's my favorite thing to do.

845
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:06,020
But if you want to go install or try to play with some random Linux app, probably good.

846
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:09,980
Or you know, you want to get this particular app from Debian and you want to get that particular

847
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:12,940
app from Fedora and you can just pick and choose.

848
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:16,100
I mean, it's also embracing a bunch of neat kernel features, right?

849
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,460
With containers and such to make all this possible.

850
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,460
So that's neat.

851
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:20,460
Yeah.

852
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:21,940
Both of us were like, yeah, performance seems just fine.

853
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:24,980
Even with something like dark table, it just seems fine.

854
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:30,900
It does see, feel like looking out Chrome OS, it's been probably since 2014, the last

855
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:31,900
time I gave it a serious go.

856
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:35,620
I think it was 2014 when we first got word of Crouton.

857
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:37,740
I was like, all right, I'll give, I'll give it a try.

858
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,820
Like every time something significant with Linux happens on the Chromebook, I'm like,

859
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:42,940
all right, okay, I'll give it a try.

860
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:45,580
So this time I was like, all right, I'll give it a try.

861
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:48,980
And I go in there and I check it out and I'm like, it's way more complicated than it used

862
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:49,980
to be.

863
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:53,180
Like it's got a full desktop now with like a whole different launcher set up.

864
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:56,180
Like if they've, they have complicated it up a little bit.

865
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:58,180
I mean, it's even got some decent window management.

866
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:00,620
We were splitting windows and dragging them around.

867
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:03,100
And it was doing the thing where it'll pair the two windows and then you can just drag

868
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:06,180
that one middle bar and it resizes both of them at the same time.

869
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,180
I love that.

870
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:09,180
I just think that's the best.

871
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,460
I kind of liked it.

872
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:11,460
Yeah.

873
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:12,460
It wasn't, it wasn't bad.

874
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:15,220
You know, I was thinking back, like, like when I was in college or similar times where

875
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:18,380
I didn't have a lot of time to mess around, but I was still, I was using Linux at the

876
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:19,380
time.

877
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:20,380
This would be fine.

878
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:22,400
You know, I was, I was doing stuff on other servers anyway.

879
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,500
If I wanted a little terminal to play with something, it's there.

880
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:32,060
That's why I like this project you found because it's a great way to like Chrome OS-ify a laptop

881
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:34,580
that you might just like keep at the couch or something.

882
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:38,180
I, I, for a little while, it was too nice of a machine to leave it like this, but for

883
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:42,660
a little while we had the XPS 13 and we just took it and wedged it between a cushion and

884
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:43,660
the couch.

885
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:44,660
Oh, nice.

886
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,620
It sounds really low tech, but it was perfect because you'd sit there and you're like,

887
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:47,860
I just want to look something up real quick.

888
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:52,580
And you'd just take out this tiny wedge of a computer, open it up and do a quick search.

889
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:56,580
And I used it all the time and I kind of miss having that, but I just couldn't commit to

890
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:57,860
putting something really nice.

891
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:59,420
That just seems like such a waste.

892
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:00,420
Right.

893
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:03,740
But maybe a Chromebook or an old laptop with, with cloud ready on it.

894
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,500
I mean, I'll give this cloud ready a go.

895
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:08,020
The free version seems perfectly fine.

896
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:12,620
And there's also other projects we'll have linked in the show notes that may take those

897
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:16,780
types of installs and perhaps Chrome OS-ify them as the projects.

898
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:17,780
Yeah.

899
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:20,700
There's various, there's various little attempts at, you know, making this work to be a little

900
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:21,700
more Linuxy.

901
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:24,780
You know, I was a little off put at first when you have to, you know, you install it

902
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:28,300
and of course you're prompted to log in with your, with your Google account, but, but that's

903
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,240
what happens on other operating systems.

904
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,340
And the nice part is you set it up, we set it up under your account and I wanted to go

905
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:35,820
play with it and you were off working, working somewhere else.

906
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:39,620
I just log in with my Google account and then suddenly it's, it's my Chromebook too, right?

907
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:42,820
Like it has all my links, it's signed in, it's ready to go.

908
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:47,440
And more importantly, we both had our own unique Linux environments.

909
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,600
So I, whatever I'd done in my Linux environment, whatever I'd set up was not applicable to

910
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,600
your account.

911
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:53,600
Right.

912
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,680
So you could go in there and set up your own environment and you didn't mess with mine.

913
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:00,380
And I, that is super nice because you can't even do that on a, on a Linux box, right?

914
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:01,380
Not by default.

915
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:02,380
No, no.

916
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:05,440
There is some potential there.

917
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:10,920
It leaves me with this weird feeling because it's, it feels much like the Android situation

918
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:15,920
where it's Linux, it's, it's Linux, but it's, it's re-imagined with some of the same base

919
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,960
parts, but it's not what we would have felt in 2011 when it came out, my, my vision for

920
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:27,420
Linux desktop for the masses involved some version of a desktop with gnome shell or plasma

921
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,420
on it.

922
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:35,720
That's always my, like that's my ideal desktop Linux is a mainstream free software desktop

923
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:38,020
is what everybody's using.

924
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:43,360
But the reality is, is Linux is a fundamental enabling technology that massive corporations

925
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:46,640
that have the means are going to use to publish their own product, right?

926
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:51,320
But they've got their own agendas, their own, their own designs on it, and they can use

927
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:54,360
those technologies because of those licenses and shape it to be whatever they want.

928
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:58,980
And it means that they don't have to invent how to do TCP IP and can instead focus on

929
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:04,720
things like services and a decent desktop feature set and things like power management,

930
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,920
power washing for restoring multi-user stuff, Linux environment containers.

931
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,880
I mean, there's a clear advantage for them.

932
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:17,640
And I, I guess I give Chrome OS more respect now after this than I did as a development

933
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:18,640
workstation.

934
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:22,640
I kind of thought that was sort of cute that they were trying to compete with WSL or, you

935
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,440
know, like Docker and, you know, all the different things that we just recently talked about

936
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,600
the code ready containers from Red Hat.

937
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:33,120
That's another attempt at this, like all these different attempts to make development on

938
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,120
the desktop match production.

939
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:39,760
Like that's one of Ubuntu's strengths is you can deploy Ubuntu LTS on your laptop and you

940
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:46,000
can develop on the same environment that you run in production.

941
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,760
Google's trying to give you all the options.

942
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,840
Hey, you got a Debian server in production, you got an Ubuntu server in production, just

943
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:52,840
great.

944
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,560
Just get Chrome OS.

945
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:55,560
We'll play with that.

946
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:56,560
It's pretty.

947
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:57,560
And you're already using Chrome anyway.

948
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,560
Yeah.

949
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:59,560
They're getting it.

950
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,560
Yeah.

951
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,400
You're already all, you got a Gmail, you're using Docs and Drive.

952
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,400
Listen.

953
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:06,800
We're going to have to install Firefox on there after the show, you realize, right?

954
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,120
Just, just to be fun.

955
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,600
We totally should.

956
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,720
We should do that.

957
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,720
We should totally do that.

958
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:15,800
Also, I just realized it'd be interesting to see what the battery life is like on that.

959
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,600
Well, you know, we might just leave it around for a while and start, start using it a bit.

960
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:24,480
It would almost, almost, if it didn't require installing PureOS, it would almost be worth

961
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,720
putting PureOS on there and see what the battery life is and then putting Chrome OS back on

962
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,280
there and see what the battery life is.

963
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,760
You know, just, just for science.

964
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,760
Yeah.

965
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:33,760
Just for science.

966
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,760
All right.

967
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:39,480
Well, these scientists are getting back to the lab, so I encourage you to join us next

968
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:44,560
week in that there chat room or mumble room, go to jblive.tv for that live extravaganza

969
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:49,560
or jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar for the time and links to everything, including

970
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:55,160
the new shows and all of that at linuxunplug.com slash 318.

971
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,280
Go get more Wes Payne over at the Tech Snaps.

972
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,280
Yeah.

973
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,280
And now Linux Headlines.

974
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,080
Wes, myself, and Drew bringing it to you every weekday.

975
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,780
Linux Headlines, that show.

976
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:09,120
And check out Self Hosted with Alex and Myself, episode one launches this week and then episode

977
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,760
two with Wendell coming up very soon.

978
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:36,600
We'll see you back here next Tuesday.

979
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:50,240
Well, there you have it, I was wondering if cloud ready was legit or not, but it seems

980
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,240
like it is.

981
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,240
Yeah.

982
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,240
Actually working pretty good.

983
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,240
It did.

984
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,240
It did work pretty good.

985
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:56,240
I think I might give it a go myself.

986
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,240
Yeah.

987
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,240
If you haven't, if you got a machine laying around.

988
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,240
I don't.

989
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,240
Yeah.

990
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,240
I don't know if there's, if it's possible to like compartmentalize it or install it.

991
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:04,400
Virtual machine would be your best bet because by default, I just wanted to wipe the whole

992
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,400
thing.

993
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,880
Initially we were thinking, we were thinking just do a VM, but then when we had the Librem

994
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,360
15 and the deliciousness of that irony, we couldn't resist.

995
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:17,880
I stumbled upon cloud ready too just recently because my Chromebook was end of life.

996
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:23,240
I was just surprised to see that Google has some life cycle for its Chrome devices.

997
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:29,640
I mean, what can be so hard to give updates for a single program?

998
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:35,680
I cannot understand that because even Windows XP or Windows 7 have a 10 years lifespan.

999
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,160
How long have you had that Chromebook?

1000
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:42,600
Well, that's an Asus 720, it came out in 2030.

1001
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:47,720
There was first a feature freeze, so installing Linux applications was not possible.

1002
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:53,720
I can somehow understand it because the hardware given to ROM was not the best one.

1003
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:59,360
But I mean, leaving the people out there now without security updates is something I cannot

1004
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,360
understand.

1005
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:03,280
I really cannot understand because hardware is known.

1006
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:08,560
When you have your conflict file for that hardware, you just push a button and it releases

1007
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:09,560
out.

1008
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:10,560
You know the kernel is going to be supported.

1009
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,560
Right.

1010
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:12,560
I can't argue with that.

1011
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,640
You would think out of all of the OSs, this would be the one that could support the longest.

1012
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,640
But who knows?

1013
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:20,640
I'm sure there's partner dynamics involved, as they would say.

1014
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:25,280
The thing is, as you told at the beginning, these are computers that are used in schools,

1015
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:30,980
that are used for people that are not that gifted when it comes to computer knowledge.

1016
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:34,680
So all they want is they see an icon and they say, I have to update.

1017
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:39,020
So they push a button, the system is rebooting, and everything is done.

1018
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:41,640
And after five or six years, you stop with that.

1019
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:47,160
And now you leave all the people with security issues with a program that has, I think, the

1020
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:51,480
worst attacking surface you can have on the internet, like the internet browser.

1021
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,480
Yeah, absolutely.

1022
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,060
That is, for me, not understandable at all.

1023
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:57,060
Really not.

1024
00:51:57,060 --> 00:52:01,400
I stumbled about cloud ready, and I probably will have to install that on my Chromebook

1025
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,400
now.

1026
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,320
I'd be curious to know if it works, because that's a great point you're making.

1027
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:09,240
And I think, obviously, the other elephant in the room on this conversation, that we've

1028
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:13,640
talked about so many times, I didn't go there, but the whole privacy aspect of it.

1029
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:19,360
It's just there's a clear privacy concern with Chromebooks that simply do not exist

1030
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,360
with desktop Linux.

1031
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,360
Not at all.

1032
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,360
Not in the same way at all.

1033
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,880
But that is an entire conversation in itself.

1034
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,640
So I didn't bring it up in this episode.

1035
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,440
And it's hard to tease that apart from the Chrome environment in general and using Google

1036
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:31,440
products.

1037
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,440
And Chromium.

1038
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,440
Yeah.

1039
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,200
So we just felt that we'd focus on the tech side of it.

1040
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,200
We don't need a two-hour on-board.

1041
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,200
Yeah.

1042
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,200
Oh, my gosh.

1043
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,640
Thinking about all that stuff, it's really something.

1044
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:44,720
I want to do a quick follow-up to a pic we did last week.

1045
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,760
So last week, I think it was, we talked about USB Top.

1046
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:54,920
But unfortunately, it is not available in Fedora, and it never will be, right, Carl?

1047
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:55,920
Never.

1048
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:56,920
It is there.

1049
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:57,920
It is there.

1050
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:58,920
What?

1051
00:52:58,920 --> 00:52:59,920
It is there.

1052
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:00,920
Yeah.

1053
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:01,920
That's right.

1054
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,920
After the show, Carl contacted me and said, hey, what do you think about me giving that

1055
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:03,920
a crack?

1056
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:04,920
Carl, you're the best.

1057
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:05,920
That's awesome.

1058
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:06,920
He knew.

1059
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:07,920
He knew we needed it.

1060
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:08,920
Yeah.

1061
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:09,920
It wasn't too bad.

1062
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:10,920
It wasn't?

1063
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:11,920
No.

1064
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:12,920
It was a pretty straightforward spec file.

1065
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:13,920
I love it.

1066
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:14,920
That's awesome.

1067
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:15,920
Best audience ever.

1068
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:16,920
OK.

1069
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:17,920
Ladies and gentlemen, another round of applause is due in this episode.

1070
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,640
We're very happy to say another episode of Brunch with Brent will be coming out tomorrow

1071
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:22,640
on the Extras feed.

1072
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:23,640
Hey-oh.

1073
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,680
Brent, we should tease this one a little bit.

1074
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,200
What can we expect from this week's episode of Brunch with Brent?

1075
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,720
Well, last week we had Drew on.

1076
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,800
I don't know if everyone caught that.

1077
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:37,240
And this week, Wes, you make it on with me.

1078
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,480
And we have a great, great conversation.

1079
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:44,120
We go into a whole bunch of stuff that is completely different than all of the previous

1080
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,760
Brunch with Brent, which is the case.

1081
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,380
Every new guest brings a new flavor.

1082
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:54,480
And so this week, I don't know, we chatted about a whole bunch of adventures in learning

1083
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,960
and problem solving, because Wes and I are all about that.

1084
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:03,640
We talked about the art of being introverted and agreeable, which that's me.

1085
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,560
That doesn't sound like us at all.

1086
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:07,120
No, not at all.

1087
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:10,440
And Wes really talked about the value of hammock time.

1088
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:14,280
And so you can learn more about that.

1089
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,280
Extras.show.

1090
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,280
Yeah.

1091
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,280
Hmm.

1092
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,280
That's hammock time.

1093
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,280
I want a hammock.

1094
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,600
Can we get one of those in the studio?

1095
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:21,600
I think we need one.

1096
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,800
I think that would be really good.

1097
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:24,800
Whew.

1098
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:29,880
I'm, you know, I can't believe we've launched The Daily Show a little bit.

1099
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,800
Because so many times in the past, we were like, nope, not good enough, damn it.

1100
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,600
And we've killed it.

1101
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:39,040
And so this time, I don't know, I think part of me thought we were never going to actually

1102
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,040
launch.

1103
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,040
It didn't feel like it, right?

1104
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,520
We were going to keep contemplating it, keep shooting it down for one reason or another.

1105
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,520
Yeah.

1106
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:50,880
But the thing where we had our breakthrough, I have to say, is I think by A, killing it

1107
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,400
and then giving space to reconsider it, like with no pressure.

1108
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:58,560
And then B, the test pilots we did, where we started.

1109
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:01,960
So we're kind of splitting up the work a little bit.

1110
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:04,720
So it'll be myself, Wes, and Drew.

1111
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,960
And that was kind of one of the breakthroughs we had, is we realized it's probably going

1112
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:11,480
to be a lot more sustainable if we don't make it all just Chris or just Joe.

1113
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,480
Not one of us goes crazy.

1114
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,480
Yeah.

1115
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:16,080
And so then we just kind of had to figure out like the math on that, how to set up like

1116
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,080
a backup system.

1117
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:20,160
And we have a check-in system that we have, because it's got to happen every single day.

1118
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,160
Right.

1119
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:25,120
I mean, we both had to learn how to and got to take advantage of the team system we have

1120
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,120
now.

1121
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,120
Yeah.

1122
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,120
Yeah.

1123
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,640
And we had to increase staffing a little bit because news research is a big part of what

1124
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:31,640
we do.

1125
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:36,320
And there's a pipeline now that brings in all of this news and it just required a little

1126
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:37,320
bit of staffing.

1127
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,320
Yeah.

1128
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,840
You don't have to, you know, draw the depths of all those barbaric Linux news sites out

1129
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:41,840
there.

1130
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:42,840
Just come to us.

1131
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,840
We got this.

1132
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:48,360
What's going to be a challenge for me, and it may even happen as soon as next week, possibly,

1133
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:53,480
because at some point I'm going to be on the road again and I'll have to do the show from

1134
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:54,480
the road somehow.

1135
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,000
But I got a decent mobile recording setup.

1136
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
That's true.

1137
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
We've been working on that.

1138
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Yeah.

1139
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
We're really going to have to figure it out now.

1140
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Mm-hmm.

1141
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Mm-hmm.

1142
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,240
Plus, we got a good backup system, so I could always pull the backup lever.

1143
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:06,240
Of course.

1144
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,220
And just be like, bail me out.

1145
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:09,360
So I could always do that, too.

1146
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,360
Yeah.

1147
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:12,800
So look for, you know, varied JB voices from time to time.

1148
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:13,800
Yeah.

1149
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,120
But I'll generally be there on Mondays for now.

1150
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:19,840
At least I would kick things off, and then Wes and I throughout the week, and then Drew

1151
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:20,840
on Fridays.

1152
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:21,840
Fridays with Drew.

1153
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:46,840
Yeah.
