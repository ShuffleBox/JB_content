WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.440
I'm very excited about today's show.

00:02.440 --> 00:05.800
We have something very cool in studio today.

00:05.800 --> 00:09.680
You can tell I'm excited about it because I'm flashing a USB drive right now, and I

00:09.680 --> 00:13.080
only do it when it's for something really important, and it is important.

00:13.080 --> 00:14.080
It is very important.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.080
Did you use Etcher?

00:15.080 --> 00:16.080
Yeah.

00:16.080 --> 00:17.080
You know what?

00:17.080 --> 00:18.080
I just like it.

00:18.080 --> 00:19.080
You know what?

00:19.080 --> 00:20.080
The only thing I appreciate about Etcher is you can plug in a thumb drive after you've

00:20.080 --> 00:21.080
launched it, and it still detects it.

00:21.080 --> 00:22.080
Yeah.

00:22.080 --> 00:23.080
Because sometimes, oh, stupid me.

00:23.080 --> 00:26.560
Did you get a chance to talk to the resin guys at the fest?

00:26.560 --> 00:28.040
No, I don't think so.

00:28.040 --> 00:29.560
Because they're the ones who make Etcher.

00:29.560 --> 00:31.240
Oh, well, I would have loved to.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.280
I did not.

00:32.280 --> 00:33.720
That would have been great.

00:33.720 --> 00:37.520
But somebody from the fest did drop something off on their way out of town.

00:37.520 --> 00:38.520
Oh?

00:38.520 --> 00:39.520
Oh?

00:39.520 --> 00:40.520
Yeah.

00:40.520 --> 00:41.520
Yeah.

00:41.520 --> 00:45.120
In studio today for the show, I'm doing a first hands-on with the new System76 Galagopro.

00:45.120 --> 00:46.120
Look at that thing.

00:46.120 --> 00:47.120
Yeah.

00:47.120 --> 00:48.960
So we'll be talking a little bit about it, and we're going to be using that flash drive

00:48.960 --> 00:51.280
to put a proper Arch install on this.

00:51.280 --> 00:53.160
I'll be testing under Ubuntu, too.

00:53.160 --> 00:54.160
I mean, because you have to.

00:54.160 --> 00:55.160
Yeah.

00:55.160 --> 00:57.200
Well, I mean, you've got to check it out as shipped.

00:57.200 --> 00:58.200
You've got to check it out as shipped.

00:58.200 --> 00:59.200
Yeah, absolutely.

00:59.200 --> 01:02.960
So let's get the System76 here in a little bit into the show.

01:02.960 --> 01:04.880
But first, you've got to get that flash drive.

01:04.880 --> 01:07.040
First we've got to get that flash drive taken care of.

01:07.040 --> 01:08.040
Then we can move on.

01:08.040 --> 01:09.040
Then we can move on.

01:09.040 --> 01:10.720
Then we can move on.

01:10.720 --> 01:27.720
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 196 for May 9, 2017.

01:27.720 --> 01:32.320
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, Jupyter Broadcasting's longest-running Linux talk show.

01:32.320 --> 01:33.320
My name is Chris.

01:33.320 --> 01:34.320
My name is Wes.

01:34.320 --> 01:35.320
Hello, Wes.

01:35.320 --> 01:39.200
Welcome to the flagship Linux program on the Jupyter Broadcasting network.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.200
That's right.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.200
Mwa ha!

01:41.200 --> 01:42.200
Mwa ha!

01:42.200 --> 01:43.200
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:43.200 --> 01:44.200
I'm sorry.

01:44.200 --> 01:45.200
I didn't mean to get it away there.

01:45.200 --> 01:46.200
With the power, you see.

01:46.200 --> 01:47.200
Yeah.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.200
Well, welcome to the show.

01:48.200 --> 01:49.960
I even managed to override the mic a little bit.

01:49.960 --> 01:51.160
I got so excited.

01:51.160 --> 01:55.400
We have a great show on the program, despite this clipping.

01:55.400 --> 02:02.800
Coming up, Wes, I'm thrilled to say in studio we have the System76 Galago Pro, which we

02:02.800 --> 02:06.840
will be giving our first hands-on impressions on in just a moment.

02:06.840 --> 02:09.200
We have some awesome news from the community.

02:09.200 --> 02:11.920
We have big news for the show itself.

02:11.920 --> 02:13.880
Which next level stuff.

02:13.880 --> 02:14.880
You know, I don't know if you noticed.

02:14.880 --> 02:15.880
Next level.

02:15.880 --> 02:16.920
I don't know if you noticed.

02:16.920 --> 02:18.160
We're getting close to episode 200.

02:18.160 --> 02:19.160
Yes, we are.

02:19.160 --> 02:20.160
I know.

02:20.160 --> 02:21.160
Isn't that wild?

02:21.160 --> 02:22.160
It's shocking, Wes.

02:22.160 --> 02:25.840
But we have a little celebration coming up, and we'll tell you about our first bits of

02:25.840 --> 02:26.840
those plans.

02:26.840 --> 02:29.920
Our friends over at Mozilla have some big news.

02:29.920 --> 02:40.320
Ubuntu is safe on the desktop, kinda, kinda, kinda, sorta.

02:40.320 --> 02:41.520
It's really confusing.

02:41.520 --> 02:47.400
I'll play Mark Shuttleworth's words directly, and then we'll discuss what it means.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.080
Server and IoT though, totally safe.

02:49.080 --> 02:50.080
Totally safe.

02:50.080 --> 02:51.080
You're locked in.

02:51.080 --> 02:52.080
Good to go.

02:52.080 --> 02:56.360
We have a lot of stuff coming up in the show, as well as some news, some open source projects,

02:56.360 --> 03:00.160
and new things that we want to talk about, including the first one, a tool to dump your

03:00.160 --> 03:03.640
login password for the current Linux users.

03:03.640 --> 03:04.640
We'll talk about all that stuff.

03:04.640 --> 03:06.360
But first, you know what we gotta do.

03:06.360 --> 03:07.840
You know what the appropriate thing is.

03:07.840 --> 03:09.920
You know what happens next.

03:09.920 --> 03:10.920
We bring in that virtual lug.

03:10.920 --> 03:11.920
Time appropriate.

03:11.920 --> 03:12.920
Greetings, Mumble Room.

03:12.920 --> 03:13.920
Hello.

03:13.920 --> 03:14.920
Hey.

03:14.920 --> 03:15.920
Hey.

03:15.920 --> 03:16.920
Give me a hug.

03:16.920 --> 03:17.920
Whoa.

03:17.920 --> 03:18.920
Dang.

03:18.920 --> 03:19.920
You know, that moved me a little bit.

03:19.920 --> 03:20.920
I'm gonna be honest.

03:20.920 --> 03:21.920
You moved me to belching.

03:21.920 --> 03:22.920
I appreciate it.

03:22.920 --> 03:23.920
Hello, guys.

03:23.920 --> 03:24.920
It's good to see you.

03:24.920 --> 03:25.920
I've missed you.

03:25.920 --> 03:27.680
I feel like it's been three weeks, even though I realize we haven't missed a beat.

03:27.680 --> 03:31.520
I wanted to prepare you though, because we all are now at risk.

03:31.520 --> 03:34.600
A great threat has fallen upon the Linux...

03:34.600 --> 03:35.600
What?

03:35.600 --> 03:36.600
What?

03:36.600 --> 03:37.600
Oh.

03:37.600 --> 03:38.600
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:38.600 --> 03:39.600
I thought I was on cable news.

03:39.600 --> 03:42.000
No, we have a cool new plugin to talk about, or application.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
It's called MiniPenguin.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.280
MiniPenguin, not mini, mini.

03:46.280 --> 03:49.600
And it's a tool to dump the login password from the current Linux desktop user.

03:49.600 --> 03:54.240
It's adapted from the idea behind a popular Windows tool called Mimikatz.

03:54.240 --> 03:55.480
And it's just what you think it is.

03:55.480 --> 03:59.440
You run it, and it takes advantage of the clear text credentials that are in memory

03:59.440 --> 04:03.100
by dumping the process and extracting lines that have the highly probable area that's

04:03.100 --> 04:04.920
containing the clear text passwords.

04:04.920 --> 04:05.920
Yeah.

04:05.920 --> 04:10.240
And so in this example, you can see he's able to pull down the Apache user and password.

04:10.240 --> 04:15.180
He's able to pull down the user that's running the GNOME process and the user that's running

04:15.180 --> 04:18.320
the VSFTPD process.

04:18.320 --> 04:22.000
So it's not necessarily limited to just the current user.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Yeah, that's wild, actually.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.480
Now, he's doing this with root credentials on this particular machine.

04:26.480 --> 04:28.620
So you have to have root credentials.

04:28.620 --> 04:32.800
But I think it's worth mentioning just this is possible.

04:32.800 --> 04:36.240
Because when you think about someone getting remote access to your machine, this helps

04:36.240 --> 04:39.600
kind of frame what they are capable of doing once they have access.

04:39.600 --> 04:41.520
And this is a good way to also audit and test, too.

04:41.520 --> 04:44.960
So it's also worth mentioning for legitimate uses.

04:44.960 --> 04:45.960
So you can go find it.

04:45.960 --> 04:47.480
We'll have it linked in the show notes.

04:47.480 --> 04:48.480
Meme program?

04:48.480 --> 04:49.480
Meme?

04:49.480 --> 04:50.480
Meme?

04:50.480 --> 04:51.480
I don't know.

04:51.480 --> 04:52.480
I don't know.

04:52.480 --> 04:54.120
So there you have it.

04:54.120 --> 04:55.680
We have C Sharp.

04:55.680 --> 04:56.960
You had a question on the top here.

04:56.960 --> 04:57.960
Go ahead.

04:57.960 --> 04:58.960
Yeah.

04:58.960 --> 05:04.440
Essentially, is this something that would be closed by GRSec or Pax, which have recently,

05:04.440 --> 05:09.280
as pointed out on the latest Linus Action news, they've kind of removed themselves from

05:09.280 --> 05:15.760
the process, the development process, or at least the patching process for the current.

05:15.760 --> 05:19.760
You mean sort of like the isolating processes from each other and not letting them snoop

05:19.760 --> 05:21.240
into areas of memory they're not supposed to?

05:21.240 --> 05:22.240
Yeah, I think that is-

05:22.240 --> 05:23.240
Yeah, exactly.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.240
Yeah.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.240
I think you're right.

05:25.240 --> 05:28.680
That's probably a great example of why things like that are pretty important.

05:28.680 --> 05:33.440
It's also a great example to remind us that this stuff sometimes is just running in memory

05:33.440 --> 05:34.440
somewhere.

05:34.440 --> 05:38.760
You can have the best encryption on your file system, and you can make sure that you keep

05:38.760 --> 05:40.160
all your applications up to date.

05:40.160 --> 05:43.360
But if someone's locally on your box and the stuff's in memory, well, there's not much

05:43.360 --> 05:44.640
you're going to be able to do about it.

05:44.640 --> 05:45.920
That's a lost cause.

05:45.920 --> 05:51.080
Yeah, unless you do something, like C Sharp's saying there, C's Harp, no, it's C Sharp.

05:51.080 --> 05:52.080
Like C Sharp.

05:52.080 --> 05:53.080
I get it, but it's with C.

05:53.080 --> 05:54.080
You got it.

05:54.080 --> 05:55.080
You're a clever one, Chris.

05:55.080 --> 05:57.820
Are you a C Sharp developer?

05:57.820 --> 05:59.640
It's more of a music pun than anything.

05:59.640 --> 06:00.640
Oh, really?

06:00.640 --> 06:03.640
But also a DSP pun, because I'm into DSP as well.

06:03.640 --> 06:04.640
Oh, nice.

06:04.640 --> 06:07.600
I actually went musical first, and then I thought, no, no, this is a geek crowd.

06:07.600 --> 06:08.600
It's probably heens.

06:08.600 --> 06:09.600
Yeah, I can tell.

06:09.600 --> 06:12.480
You guys have the best compression of pretty much every Linux podcast.

06:12.480 --> 06:13.480
Well, thank you.

06:13.480 --> 06:14.480
Aww.

06:14.480 --> 06:16.840
That's the nicest thing anybody has said to me all week.

06:16.840 --> 06:17.840
Dang it.

06:17.840 --> 06:20.960
Those are the things no one else will notice.

06:20.960 --> 06:21.960
Yeah, we also have the best-

06:21.960 --> 06:22.960
Oh, man.

06:22.960 --> 06:23.960
It's so appreciated.

06:23.960 --> 06:24.960
Anyways-

06:24.960 --> 06:25.960
We also have the best mic clipping.

06:25.960 --> 06:26.960
Nobody has our mic clipping.

06:26.960 --> 06:27.960
That's right.

06:27.960 --> 06:28.960
20 dB over, baby.

06:28.960 --> 06:29.960
Guaranteed.

06:29.960 --> 06:30.960
All right.

06:30.960 --> 06:38.760
Well, we've been following the saga of Thunderbird, and we have finally some resolution.

06:38.760 --> 06:40.560
Nothing's going to change.

06:40.560 --> 06:44.080
Pretty much the weird, awkward relationship continues.

06:44.080 --> 06:45.640
But you know what?

06:45.640 --> 06:46.640
That's my interpretation.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.620
I won't put words in Mozilla's mouth.

06:48.620 --> 06:55.760
On the mozilla.org blog, it says, the investigations on Thunderbird's future have concluded.

06:55.760 --> 07:00.000
The Mozilla Foundation has agreed to serve as the legal and fiscal home for the Thunderbird

07:00.000 --> 07:05.400
project, but Thunderbird will migrate off Mozilla Corporation's infrastructure, separating

07:05.400 --> 07:09.120
the operational aspects of the project.

07:09.120 --> 07:12.640
So this means just sort of like even less of what we had before?

07:12.640 --> 07:15.520
Yeah, I guess so.

07:15.520 --> 07:18.200
Not a strong change here.

07:18.200 --> 07:21.440
They write, legally, our existence is still under the Mozilla Foundation through their

07:21.440 --> 07:26.280
ownership of the trademark and their control of the update path and websites that we use.

07:26.280 --> 07:29.480
This arrangement has been working well from the Thunderbird point of view.

07:29.480 --> 07:32.640
But there are still pain points and build release, localization, and divergent plans

07:32.640 --> 07:35.080
with respect to add-ons, to name a few.

07:35.080 --> 07:38.400
These are pain points for both Thunderbird and Firefox, and we want them resolved.

07:38.400 --> 07:42.920
However, the council feels these pain points would not be addressed by moving somewhere

07:42.920 --> 07:43.920
else.

07:43.920 --> 07:46.640
Thus, not much is really changing.

07:46.640 --> 07:50.640
What's next is Thunderbird Council and the Mozilla Foundation executive team will maintain

07:50.640 --> 07:56.040
a good working relationship and talk and make decisions in a timely manner, they say.

07:56.040 --> 07:59.840
The Thunderbird Council and team will make meaningful progress, they say, and they're

07:59.840 --> 08:04.660
going to give either side six months notice if things get shitty and they want to separate.

08:04.660 --> 08:07.520
So this is what we get.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.440
This is what we get.

08:09.440 --> 08:17.720
Now, not addressed in here is the very fact that Thunderbird is really sort of up a creek

08:17.720 --> 08:23.200
because Firefox is moving away from Zool and they're implementing new process technologies

08:23.200 --> 08:27.280
that essentially break all the add-ons and hacks that Thunderbird uses to exist.

08:27.280 --> 08:29.800
And none of that really seems to be addressed in this post.

08:29.800 --> 08:32.760
Nothing really seems to be changing other than now that these guys are going to be responsible

08:32.760 --> 08:35.080
for running their own infrastructure.

08:35.080 --> 08:40.000
Also the section at the end titled, A Bright Future, that didn't sell to you.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.480
You're not optimistic.

08:41.480 --> 08:45.440
No, it just didn't grab me.

08:45.440 --> 08:46.440
Didn't really sell it to me.

08:46.440 --> 08:51.000
I think the real reason why is it feels like exactly what happened to Firefox, only way

08:51.000 --> 09:00.000
more dramatically worse because solutions like Nullius are really starting to gain traction.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.720
I talked to a dozen people at Linux Fest that are using Nullius.

09:03.720 --> 09:09.320
Noah is using Nullius now, you use Nullius.

09:09.320 --> 09:12.640
I know that there's several people in companies that we're familiar with now that are switching

09:12.640 --> 09:16.400
over to Linux on the desktop and Nullius for their mail client.

09:16.400 --> 09:18.880
And there's plenty of other really good ones too.

09:18.880 --> 09:23.120
We're going to talk about System76 in a little bit and they're eyeballing Geary.

09:23.120 --> 09:24.120
Is that right?

09:24.120 --> 09:25.120
Sure.

09:25.120 --> 09:27.160
Oh, future is not bright.

09:27.160 --> 09:28.160
Not bright.

09:28.160 --> 09:29.440
Mumble room any thoughts on Thunderbird before we move on?

09:29.440 --> 09:32.520
I hate to be a downer, but I know it's a topic that people actually seem to care about

09:32.520 --> 09:37.320
because we get lots of people submitting links to Thunderbird stories.

09:37.320 --> 09:42.320
I was trying to find this last time when we were talking about it and I couldn't find

09:42.320 --> 09:43.320
anything.

09:43.320 --> 09:47.480
So I found this blog now, but I really have no thoughts at this point outside of I'm still

09:47.480 --> 09:53.000
going to be using Thunderbird while I read this and then decide what it means to me.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.400
I think that's fair because it's not like the world is crumbling around you.

09:56.400 --> 10:00.280
You still have Thunderbird if it's working for you and you're perfectly fine for a while.

10:00.280 --> 10:01.280
Yeah.

10:01.280 --> 10:02.280
Okay.

10:02.280 --> 10:03.280
I think that's a fair assessment.

10:03.280 --> 10:04.280
Anybody else?

10:04.280 --> 10:05.280
Okay.

10:05.280 --> 10:10.560
I think the harder part is like what would you recommend to a new user if they're starting

10:10.560 --> 10:11.560
today?

10:11.560 --> 10:12.560
Yeah.

10:12.560 --> 10:13.560
Probably Noleus.

10:13.560 --> 10:14.560
Yeah.

10:14.560 --> 10:15.560
I wanted to also just mention really quick.

10:15.560 --> 10:18.040
This has come in across our radar a few times throughout the week.

10:18.040 --> 10:20.920
There's a – I'm going to say – I'm just going to call it a lap book.

10:20.920 --> 10:28.000
There's a 12.3-inch lap book for $329 pre-running Ubuntu, but it has something unique.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.560
It has a 2K screen.

10:29.560 --> 10:30.560
Oh.

10:30.560 --> 10:31.560
Which I really think is a sweet spot.

10:31.560 --> 10:32.560
That's interesting.

10:32.560 --> 10:33.560
I love a 2K screen.

10:33.560 --> 10:34.560
Oh, $329.

10:34.560 --> 10:35.560
That's a pretty nice price.

10:35.560 --> 10:36.560
Yeah.

10:36.560 --> 10:39.720
It's going to have an Intel N3450.

10:39.720 --> 10:45.600
So that's the Apollo Lake quad-core with 2.2 gigahertz burst, and it has an integrated

10:45.600 --> 10:46.600
Intel graphics 500.

10:46.600 --> 10:49.760
So not a workhorse, but hey, it'll open your Chrome.

10:49.760 --> 10:50.760
Yeah.

10:50.760 --> 10:55.800
And you get almost all of the perks of a high-resolution screen without the baggage of high DPI.

10:55.800 --> 10:57.680
You can get 6 gigs of RAM in it.

10:57.680 --> 11:00.600
It has a storage slot where you can add more storage through M.2.

11:00.600 --> 11:01.600
Not bad.

11:01.600 --> 11:02.600
Is that right?

11:02.600 --> 11:03.600
Not bad.

11:03.600 --> 11:10.840
It has a 36-hour battery, which is actually the same that the Galago Pro there has.

11:10.840 --> 11:11.840
Nice.

11:11.840 --> 11:13.960
This seems like it might be a really handy little travel laptop.

11:13.960 --> 11:16.480
Not your main thing, but throw it in your bag and go.

11:16.480 --> 11:17.480
Yeah.

11:17.480 --> 11:20.160
I mean, for $330, US greenbacks there.

11:20.160 --> 11:21.160
That is pretty good.

11:21.160 --> 11:22.640
And you can also, I think, get it with some Windows.

11:22.640 --> 11:23.640
I'm not familiar with it.

11:23.640 --> 11:24.640
Now there's a bad taste in my mouth.

11:24.640 --> 11:25.640
Yeah.

11:25.640 --> 11:29.920
It's got some sort of digital assistant that will read the weather to you or something.

11:29.920 --> 11:30.920
Some people like it.

11:30.920 --> 11:31.920
Yeah.

11:31.920 --> 11:32.920
Yeah.

11:32.920 --> 11:33.920
So there you go.

11:33.920 --> 11:35.600
Listen, Wes, I got a secret for you.

11:35.600 --> 11:38.120
If you want to dig into all things Linux, you want to get a little bit further.

11:38.120 --> 11:39.120
I really do.

11:39.120 --> 11:42.320
If you want to go further, go to Linux Academy.

11:42.320 --> 11:43.320
Just go there.

11:43.320 --> 11:44.320
LinuxAcademy.com.

11:44.320 --> 11:45.320
You go there.

11:45.320 --> 11:46.320
You can get a seven-day free trial.

11:46.320 --> 11:47.320
Learn.

11:47.320 --> 11:48.320
I'm not even going to say try it out.

11:48.320 --> 11:49.320
To learn.

11:49.320 --> 11:52.680
To learn passionately about things like Linux and things around Linux.

11:52.680 --> 11:57.160
AWS, for me, when I first had to go hands-on for a client, was a nightmare.

11:57.160 --> 11:59.400
There was no resource like Linux Academy back then.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.720
I just tried to go in and learn it myself.

12:01.720 --> 12:02.720
And it's doable.

12:02.720 --> 12:07.680
But, man, could I have gotten so much further and really, really used my time better if

12:07.680 --> 12:09.640
I had something like Linux Academy.

12:09.640 --> 12:12.520
Also now, same is true for Azure.

12:12.520 --> 12:14.200
OpenStack conference is going on right now.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.880
A lot of buzz around OpenStack.

12:15.880 --> 12:17.680
You've probably seen a lot of news this last week.

12:17.680 --> 12:20.440
If you follow the news closely about OpenStack, it's because they've got a big conference

12:20.440 --> 12:21.440
going on.

12:21.440 --> 12:22.440
That's right.

12:22.440 --> 12:23.560
We're going to be playing quotes from Mark Shuttleworth when he was interviewed there

12:23.560 --> 12:24.800
here in just a little bit.

12:24.800 --> 12:25.840
And it's a huge topic.

12:25.840 --> 12:27.920
And it's a huge industry trend.

12:27.920 --> 12:30.360
Especially for folks that want to build their own local cloud.

12:30.360 --> 12:33.360
They don't necessarily want to be on another provider, but they want to have some of the

12:33.360 --> 12:34.360
benefits.

12:34.360 --> 12:38.200
OpenStack is essential to, and really, Linux is essential to all of this.

12:38.200 --> 12:42.080
And so Linux Academy is the perfect blend, because it's all things Linux, put together

12:42.080 --> 12:45.840
by Linux enthusiasts, people that are passionate about this stuff.

12:45.840 --> 12:48.720
And then as they have grown, they've met the market demand.

12:48.720 --> 12:52.240
And now Linux Academy stands alone in this category.

12:52.240 --> 12:56.560
From containers to DevOps, big data, and all things nitty-bitty Linux, go to linuxacademy.com

12:56.560 --> 13:02.280
slash unplugged and sign up for a free seven-day trial at linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

13:02.280 --> 13:05.840
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

13:05.840 --> 13:07.680
I just had to do a little dance there.

13:07.680 --> 13:08.680
Did you see me?

13:08.680 --> 13:11.440
That was only for you too, because it's not like it's a video show.

13:11.440 --> 13:12.720
Nobody else got to see my dance, Wes.

13:12.720 --> 13:13.720
That was just you.

13:13.720 --> 13:14.920
Unplugged program.

13:14.920 --> 13:15.920
It was lovely.

13:15.920 --> 13:16.920
You should all be very jealous.

13:16.920 --> 13:20.920
If you're lucky, it'll show up somewhere.

13:20.920 --> 13:21.920
Apricity OS.

13:21.920 --> 13:22.920
Oh, Wes.

13:22.920 --> 13:24.960
Apricity OS.

13:24.960 --> 13:26.280
It comes to an end.

13:26.280 --> 13:28.560
Like all good things, it too comes to an end.

13:28.560 --> 13:31.840
They say it's been their privilege to develop the operating system and to be part of the

13:31.840 --> 13:32.840
community.

13:32.840 --> 13:38.520
But unfortunately, they no longer have the time required for the upkeep.

13:38.520 --> 13:41.440
I think they're shutting it all down too, like updates and all that kind of stuff.

13:41.440 --> 13:42.440
Boom.

13:42.440 --> 13:43.440
This was an Arch-based distro.

13:43.440 --> 13:46.520
I thought these were the big up-and-coming thing, like Arch-based distros were the new

13:46.520 --> 13:47.520
hits.

13:47.520 --> 13:48.520
The new hits.

13:48.520 --> 13:49.520
Yeah.

13:49.520 --> 13:50.520
Is the Arch bubble popped, Wes?

13:50.520 --> 13:51.520
Maybe.

13:51.520 --> 13:52.520
Boy.

13:52.520 --> 13:53.520
Dun-dun-dun.

13:53.520 --> 13:55.720
I mean, we've got Antigros.

13:55.720 --> 14:03.120
Sanjaro is like almost weirdly popular, it seems like.

14:03.120 --> 14:06.960
I did run Apricity for like the better part of six months.

14:06.960 --> 14:08.920
It was really just Arch.

14:08.920 --> 14:13.120
That's why I like to put it in here, because you actually rocked this as your daily driver.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.760
Good old Apricity.

14:14.760 --> 14:17.600
And it was a good out-of-the-box Arch experience, right?

14:17.600 --> 14:18.600
Yeah.

14:18.600 --> 14:20.720
Little did you know, they were struggling to keep it afloat.

14:20.720 --> 14:21.720
Right.

14:21.720 --> 14:25.680
And that's always the risk with these niche, smaller distros.

14:25.680 --> 14:26.680
It can be really hard.

14:26.680 --> 14:29.320
Like, okay, is this something they're dedicated to?

14:29.320 --> 14:34.120
How much, you know, I know like there's some questions like when Solus first appeared,

14:34.120 --> 14:38.360
how you decide, you know, the marketplace of ideas, which things are worthy of support,

14:38.360 --> 14:41.080
which things will actually get that support can be really hard to figure out.

14:41.080 --> 14:45.280
I don't know if Apricity was unique enough or had enough of its own thing or, you know,

14:45.280 --> 14:46.840
just not enough support.

14:46.840 --> 14:47.840
Yeah.

14:47.840 --> 14:50.400
I mean, I don't want to piss on its gravestone.

14:50.400 --> 14:55.840
I would say that I think when you were running it, I generally, you know, would have a reaction

14:55.840 --> 14:57.440
of, oh, I got to try that out.

14:57.440 --> 14:59.120
I never really had that draw.

14:59.120 --> 15:02.600
I was like, oh, okay, so it looks like I could get that with Antigros and I just changed

15:02.600 --> 15:03.600
the theme.

15:03.600 --> 15:07.200
And I never really could connect with what it, and I'm sure it was more than that, but

15:07.200 --> 15:09.920
it failed to connect with me to what it actually was.

15:09.920 --> 15:14.560
And so in that aspect, I'm more inclined to go with one of the larger Arch variants or

15:14.560 --> 15:17.400
Arch itself, if I want that experience.

15:17.400 --> 15:18.400
I think good on them.

15:18.400 --> 15:20.760
They decided they didn't have the time for it, better to move on.

15:20.760 --> 15:22.720
Yeah, there's a lot of trade-offs both ways.

15:22.720 --> 15:23.720
And yeah, exactly.

15:23.720 --> 15:24.720
Yeah.

15:24.720 --> 15:25.720
There you have it.

15:25.720 --> 15:26.960
Apricity, we barely knew ye.

15:26.960 --> 15:27.960
But thank you.

15:27.960 --> 15:28.960
It was fun.

15:28.960 --> 15:29.960
And it was great for Wes for a little while.

15:29.960 --> 15:34.200
I mean, if there's anyone who was using Apricity and hasn't tried Antigros, they certainly

15:34.200 --> 15:35.200
should.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.200
Yeah.

15:36.200 --> 15:37.200
Yeah.

15:37.200 --> 15:38.200
Go give it a look.

15:38.200 --> 15:39.200
Give it a look.

15:39.200 --> 15:40.200
Speaking of Antigros, ours just finished.

15:40.200 --> 15:41.200
Oh, did it?

15:41.200 --> 15:42.200
Oh, very nice.

15:42.200 --> 15:43.200
Thanks, Wes.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.200
Thanks for keeping an eye on that.

15:44.200 --> 15:45.680
You know who else is bailing out of Linux?

15:45.680 --> 15:46.680
Google.

15:46.680 --> 15:47.680
What?

15:47.680 --> 15:48.680
Google sort of.

15:48.680 --> 15:54.480
So do you have any familiarity with the Fuchsia smartphone OS project they have?

15:54.480 --> 15:55.480
A little bit.

15:55.480 --> 15:56.960
I hear it mentioned from time to time.

15:56.960 --> 16:00.360
Yeah, it's like their Skunk Works kind of like in the back room project.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.920
Oh, that's what that smell is.

16:01.920 --> 16:02.920
Yeah.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.400
And unlike Chrome OS or Android, no Linux.

16:05.400 --> 16:09.600
It uses a new Google-developed microkernel called Magenta.

16:09.600 --> 16:13.120
And Fuchsia is running on top of Magenta.

16:13.120 --> 16:16.720
And in this case, Google will not only be dumping the Linux kernel, but also the GPL.

16:16.720 --> 16:17.720
Oh, who?

16:17.720 --> 16:18.720
Yeah.

16:18.720 --> 16:19.720
What's the license here?

16:19.720 --> 16:24.400
It's BSD, Clause 3, MIT, and Apache 2.0.

16:24.400 --> 16:28.120
And dumping the Linux kernel might come as a bit of a shock to maybe some of you listening.

16:28.120 --> 16:31.760
But if you look at Android itself, they really haven't been keeping up with upstream Linux

16:31.760 --> 16:33.960
kernel releases for a while.

16:33.960 --> 16:36.280
Android is maybe a little better off.

16:36.280 --> 16:38.720
But like the Google Pixel, you know, the...

16:38.720 --> 16:40.040
I had that thing right in my pocket.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.040
Which I think is...

16:41.040 --> 16:45.440
I mean, I think they have a current newer build in development that runs off a newer

16:45.440 --> 16:46.440
kernel.

16:46.440 --> 16:49.080
And this new one, kernel 3.18, I believe.

16:49.080 --> 16:50.080
Hmm.

16:50.080 --> 16:51.080
Yeah.

16:51.080 --> 16:52.080
Sorry.

16:52.080 --> 16:53.080
That's rough.

16:53.080 --> 16:55.120
You should have seen...

16:55.120 --> 16:56.120
Oh, man.

16:56.120 --> 16:59.280
The only reason this should be a video show right now is so people could have seen your

16:59.280 --> 17:00.280
face when you...

17:00.280 --> 17:01.280
Ooh, he says.

17:01.280 --> 17:02.280
Oh.

17:02.280 --> 17:05.400
That's just no good.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.400
That was good, Wes.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.920
I mean, I'm a kernel hipster, but still.

17:07.920 --> 17:08.920
That was good.

17:08.920 --> 17:09.920
Yeah.

17:09.920 --> 17:13.920
Google's documentation describes Magenta as targeting modern phones and modern personal

17:13.920 --> 17:18.680
computers with fast processor and non-trivial amounts of RAM with arbitrary peripherals

17:18.680 --> 17:22.760
doing open-ended computation.

17:22.760 --> 17:27.480
Now this is also neat because the apps, they're written in another one of Google's background

17:27.480 --> 17:33.600
projects called Flutter, a project written in Dart, which is Google's reboot of JavaScript,

17:33.600 --> 17:39.160
which on mobile has a focus on high performance, like 120 frames per second type app performance.

17:39.160 --> 17:44.920
It's also Vulkan-based and their renderer is called Escher, and it promises to have

17:44.920 --> 17:48.920
volumetric soft shadow capabilities in its UI.

17:48.920 --> 17:50.160
Yeah.

17:50.160 --> 17:55.560
It's designed to run the design-heavy material design from Google.

17:55.560 --> 18:01.440
So their whole thing here is maybe a mobile phone OS that would free them away from the

18:01.440 --> 18:09.240
GPL, and if you look at it, the basic design elements just kind of look like Android.

18:09.240 --> 18:15.120
They are getting this to a point where this is going to be a one-to-one UI swap.

18:15.120 --> 18:20.400
If your stuff uses material design, like all of Google's stuff does, it's just going to

18:20.400 --> 18:21.400
look better.

18:21.400 --> 18:22.400
You wouldn't even know.

18:22.400 --> 18:25.200
Look at these design mock-ups and these early prototypes.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.540
It really does just look, yeah.

18:26.540 --> 18:27.540
Looks like Android.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.640
It's those shadows, man.

18:29.640 --> 18:34.200
So even before we ever really get to good Android apps on the Linux desktop, that whole

18:34.200 --> 18:35.800
hope is just going to go right away.

18:35.800 --> 18:40.880
Well, the problem is I have is I love that everybody here has got a Linux in their pocket

18:40.880 --> 18:41.880
line.

18:41.880 --> 18:42.880
You know, they've got the Linux in the pocket.

18:42.880 --> 18:43.880
Yeah, that is a good one, isn't it?

18:43.880 --> 18:45.480
We're all fucking around running with Linux.

18:45.480 --> 18:50.400
You know, I love that go-to because it's like so poignant, like how Android is Linux-powered

18:50.400 --> 18:53.360
and ergo Linux is everywhere.

18:53.360 --> 18:55.920
And then you get into the cloud and you get into networking and all, and then of course

18:55.920 --> 18:56.920
huge.

18:56.920 --> 19:00.360
It's just that whole line of, they're in our pocket, if they do this, they're going to

19:00.360 --> 19:01.520
exclude that.

19:01.520 --> 19:05.640
And that, Google would wrong me.

19:05.640 --> 19:06.640
That's all I care about.

19:06.640 --> 19:10.480
I really, I actually, in some regards, hope that they do drop Linux.

19:10.480 --> 19:18.240
I wonder if this will be worse for small players, you know, like with less hope of, you know,

19:18.240 --> 19:21.920
if there's less upstream development, they don't have the, you know, the crazy momentum

19:21.920 --> 19:25.880
that the Linux project has, what's the kind of, what's the hardware enablement story going

19:25.880 --> 19:26.880
to be like, right?

19:26.880 --> 19:30.160
I mean, it's no problem for Samsung to make sure their latest system on a chip works with

19:30.160 --> 19:32.640
it because they want to sell this, you know, use this platform.

19:32.640 --> 19:35.720
But what about like, you know, third-party retailers, are you trying to use, you know,

19:35.720 --> 19:37.040
more generally sourced components?

19:37.040 --> 19:38.640
I wonder if this will be worse.

19:38.640 --> 19:41.440
C-Sharp, you feel like it would be a bad development.

19:41.440 --> 19:46.000
I actually kind of feel like it could be a good development if they moved away from Linux.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
I don't know.

19:47.000 --> 19:52.040
I feel like if the NSA, which is so at odds with the citizenry, especially of the US,

19:52.040 --> 19:57.120
I mean, I'm in Canada, but is he constantly in contention with a government body, then

19:57.120 --> 20:02.800
I don't see how Google is really going to steamroll anything more than the NSA could,

20:02.800 --> 20:03.800
you know what I mean?

20:03.800 --> 20:04.800
Okay.

20:04.800 --> 20:05.800
Fair point.

20:05.800 --> 20:08.160
Well, Mini-Mech, you actually make a strong point.

20:08.160 --> 20:12.680
One of the best things that's happened to Linux is manufacturers have to support Android,

20:12.680 --> 20:13.680
huh?

20:13.680 --> 20:21.680
Well, the problem is, you see, that if manufacturers start to develop drivers only for that foxy

20:21.680 --> 20:27.080
system, Linux is out of the, yeah, you can't use it anymore.

20:27.080 --> 20:35.120
So these devices will become some kind of wallet garden controlled by Google.

20:35.120 --> 20:41.240
I've always felt like Linux is a bit like time travel and that you can use it for powers

20:41.240 --> 20:46.600
of absolute good, like Captain Kirk does to save the world from aliens that want to communicate

20:46.600 --> 20:48.240
with whales.

20:48.240 --> 20:52.120
Or you can use it to go back and save Hitler.

20:52.120 --> 20:58.820
And I feel like what Google does is they use Linux to surveil and monitor the people on

20:58.820 --> 21:06.020
a mass scale and then privatize that and sell it back to carriers, they use it for advertising,

21:06.020 --> 21:12.200
the government gets access to it through information requests, and they do all of it with the assistance

21:12.200 --> 21:13.200
of Linux.

21:13.200 --> 21:18.320
It's like using the ultimate tool for good for the ultimate suppression of the people,

21:18.320 --> 21:26.240
privatized domestic spying is a huge problem and they use Android to do it.

21:26.240 --> 21:28.520
And to me, I just, I can't get over it.

21:28.520 --> 21:33.080
It's like they took something great and they used it for evil, it feels like.

21:33.080 --> 21:38.760
And part of me hates the fact that Linux is complicit in this.

21:38.760 --> 21:43.920
And so if they stopped using Linux on Android, this mass surveillance operating system that

21:43.920 --> 21:50.440
we all happily buy and then pay carriers to track us even further and sell that information,

21:50.440 --> 21:55.760
at least they won't be using Linux to pull it all off, at least in the devices themselves.

21:55.760 --> 21:57.560
So that's worth it in your eyes?

21:57.560 --> 21:58.560
I don't know.

21:58.560 --> 22:00.680
Like relevance drop that Linux may have?

22:00.680 --> 22:01.680
I don't know.

22:01.680 --> 22:05.680
I mean, I feel like, I mean, I guess if this thing is awesome and gets a really good upstream

22:05.680 --> 22:09.280
community, but what will the governance look like, right, and will this ever be targeted

22:09.280 --> 22:10.280
for other devices?

22:10.280 --> 22:11.780
Will there be third party ROM?

22:11.780 --> 22:16.320
If they could do something that would make application or I'm sorry, operating system

22:16.320 --> 22:21.840
updates more deliverable to more devices and get more security patches out to consumers,

22:21.840 --> 22:24.360
this could be a net benefit for consumers too.

22:24.360 --> 22:25.360
That's true.

22:25.360 --> 22:27.560
I doubt that it's Linux that's preventing them from doing that.

22:27.560 --> 22:31.640
So in fact, all of the issues I think that I have with Android, it's none of its Linux.

22:31.640 --> 22:34.240
It's all performance stuff, which is on the Android layer.

22:34.240 --> 22:37.400
It's all the other things around Android and none of it's because of Linux.

22:37.400 --> 22:38.880
It's not the kernel that's stopping you.

22:38.880 --> 22:42.480
Yeah, it feels like if they wanted to solve some of their problems, dropping Linux isn't

22:42.480 --> 22:43.480
what they need to do.

22:43.480 --> 22:47.300
But at the same time, maybe it's, I don't know, maybe there could be some good for it.

22:47.300 --> 22:53.020
Although Minimac makes a really great point, I really think that Linux has benefited greatly

22:53.020 --> 22:57.960
from device manufacturers having to work with Android, especially at the embedded level.

22:57.960 --> 23:00.100
I think it's been huge.

23:00.100 --> 23:01.880
So that would be definitely a step back.

23:01.880 --> 23:02.880
Yeah, we'll see.

23:02.880 --> 23:03.880
We'll see.

23:03.880 --> 23:04.880
We'll see what happens.

23:04.880 --> 23:07.360
Project Fuchsia looks like it's going to be interesting, and we're seeing more screenshots.

23:07.360 --> 23:09.080
We're seeing more stuff about it.

23:09.080 --> 23:10.520
Yeah, becoming real.

23:10.520 --> 23:11.520
Yeah, exactly.

23:11.520 --> 23:15.440
I have something really, really cool to talk about.

23:15.440 --> 23:21.080
So last week we mentioned the caster soundboard, and this week, holy crap, Wes, I can say it

23:21.080 --> 23:24.220
has really gotten a life of its own.

23:24.220 --> 23:26.560
So thank you to everybody who's been taking a look at trying to make this thing better.

23:26.560 --> 23:30.480
We've been getting a lot of submissions and our poll requests.

23:30.480 --> 23:31.480
And it's also...

23:31.480 --> 23:32.480
Oh, that's awesome.

23:32.480 --> 23:36.400
We have the AUR, too, so now you can rebuild it from the AUR if you want to install it

23:36.400 --> 23:37.400
really easily.

23:37.400 --> 23:42.440
We have eight contributors, 31 commits, two branches already.

23:42.440 --> 23:45.040
And if you don't remember from last week, this is a soundboard for Hot Keen and Playing

23:45.040 --> 23:48.680
Back, all the little like sound bites and music intros and stuff like that we have on

23:48.680 --> 23:49.680
our shows.

23:49.680 --> 23:50.760
And look at this, Wes.

23:50.760 --> 23:51.760
You can...

23:51.760 --> 23:52.760
Here's how to build it from source.

23:52.760 --> 23:57.640
Here's how to install all the requirements on Fedora, Debian, even some Mac OS X thing.

23:57.640 --> 23:58.640
Oh, it's in brew.

23:58.640 --> 23:59.640
Look at that.

23:59.640 --> 24:00.640
Yeah, it's in brew.

24:00.640 --> 24:01.640
Yeah.

24:01.640 --> 24:02.640
It's so cute.

24:02.640 --> 24:03.640
And then you can pull it down.

24:03.640 --> 24:05.320
The whole thing is in the AUR, though.

24:05.320 --> 24:06.680
Gosh, that's cool.

24:06.680 --> 24:09.840
It's really neat to see the community come together like this because people are now

24:09.840 --> 24:12.600
pulling it down and playing with it.

24:12.600 --> 24:14.800
And like producer Michael before the show was saying, you know, I just have it down

24:14.800 --> 24:15.800
on my machine.

24:15.800 --> 24:16.800
I've been playing around with it.

24:16.800 --> 24:17.800
That's awesome.

24:17.800 --> 24:18.800
It's starting to look really cool.

24:18.800 --> 24:19.800
It's starting to really come together.

24:19.800 --> 24:20.800
Yeah.

24:20.800 --> 24:23.800
So if you want to check out, it's an open source soundboard that we're working on right

24:23.800 --> 24:25.240
now with the community.

24:25.240 --> 24:28.680
And we're adding in features that there really hasn't been something like this on Linux.

24:28.680 --> 24:33.520
There's a few on the Mac that are pretty good, but we're trying to do this on Linux.

24:33.520 --> 24:35.160
And Caster Soundboard is pretty much there.

24:35.160 --> 24:36.160
It's so awesome.

24:36.160 --> 24:37.440
And it's not even an Electron app.

24:37.440 --> 24:38.440
No.

24:38.440 --> 24:41.840
It's a C++ in the Qt 5 app, as they say.

24:41.840 --> 24:45.600
Caster Soundboard, an awesome community effort, originally created a couple of years by a

24:45.600 --> 24:46.600
community member.

24:46.600 --> 24:47.600
He's back, too.

24:47.600 --> 24:48.600
He's in there working.

24:48.600 --> 24:49.600
Oh, awesome.

24:49.600 --> 24:50.600
Yeah.

24:50.600 --> 24:51.600
That is so cool.

24:51.600 --> 24:52.600
Yeah.

24:52.600 --> 24:53.600
I really appreciate it.

24:53.600 --> 24:54.600
Yeah.

24:54.600 --> 24:55.600
Covariant sensor or covariant tensor.

24:55.600 --> 24:56.600
I can't remember.

24:56.600 --> 24:57.600
It's something like that.

24:57.600 --> 24:58.600
Yeah.

24:58.600 --> 24:59.600
Yeah.

24:59.600 --> 25:00.600
Michael's in there.

25:00.600 --> 25:01.600
Maelstrom's in there.

25:01.600 --> 25:02.600
Chasing Logic.

25:02.600 --> 25:03.600
Of course, the Beard's in there.

25:03.600 --> 25:04.600
ASC is in there.

25:04.600 --> 25:05.600
GDogg is in there.

25:05.600 --> 25:06.600
Freq Labs is in there.

25:06.600 --> 25:08.040
Freq Labs, whatever he goes by.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.700
So thank you guys for working on it.

25:09.700 --> 25:12.800
You can see the little spike right there in the activity.

25:12.800 --> 25:13.800
It's really cool.

25:13.800 --> 25:14.800
So it's Caster Soundboard.

25:14.800 --> 25:17.500
We'll have a link in the show notes if you want to play around with our free open source

25:17.500 --> 25:21.640
soundboard that we're developing for production purposes here at Jupiter Broadcasting, but

25:21.640 --> 25:25.440
really creating it so the entire community has something they can mess around with.

25:25.440 --> 25:29.720
And it's like caster soundboard-git if you want to install it from the AUR.

25:29.720 --> 25:34.960
Now, oh, I wish I, speaking of the soundboard, I wish I had my soundboard set up right now

25:34.960 --> 25:38.920
because I would totally do a breaking news clip because this is breaking news right here

25:38.920 --> 25:39.920
on the Unplugged show.

25:39.920 --> 25:40.920
Yeah, that's right.

25:40.920 --> 25:41.920
It is.

25:41.920 --> 25:43.840
So Linux Unplugged is at an interesting point.

25:43.840 --> 25:47.120
It's the last big Linux show that we have right now.

25:47.120 --> 25:48.720
User Air is about to start back up.

25:48.720 --> 25:50.560
Linux Action News is about to start.

25:50.560 --> 25:51.560
Ask NOAA is brand new.

25:51.560 --> 25:52.560
Brand new.

25:52.560 --> 25:53.560
Growing.

25:53.560 --> 25:54.560
Growing.

25:54.560 --> 26:01.400
And so really the now Linux powerhouse in the Jupiter Broadcasting lineup is Linux Unplugged.

26:01.400 --> 26:05.680
So let's take a moment and talk about something we're doing as episode 200 closely approaches.

26:05.680 --> 26:09.320
This is just between you and me and the audience and the community listening.

26:09.320 --> 26:18.320
So nobody tell anyone we're going to go into the Cone of Silence.

26:18.320 --> 26:19.840
I am deeply concerned.

26:19.840 --> 26:20.840
All right.

26:20.840 --> 26:21.840
So the Cone of Silence here.

26:21.840 --> 26:22.840
I just love that clip.

26:22.840 --> 26:26.200
I should have a reason to use it because I actually want you to tell everybody.

26:26.200 --> 26:31.120
We are launching a Linux Unplugged subreddit to replace the Linux Action Show subreddit.

26:31.120 --> 26:35.280
It always felt like Linux Unplugged was kind of like the younger sibling that was tagging

26:35.280 --> 26:38.160
along Linux Action Show and being like, I want to have fun too.

26:38.160 --> 26:39.160
I want to have a subreddit.

26:39.160 --> 26:40.160
We like Linux.

26:40.160 --> 26:41.160
Yeah.

26:41.160 --> 26:42.160
And so now, no, no.

26:42.160 --> 26:43.160
We're grown up.

26:43.160 --> 26:44.160
We graduated.

26:44.160 --> 26:50.200
And our Linux Unplugged is officially a thing and we're hoping it can be used to input content,

26:50.200 --> 26:57.560
give us feedback for the show, really kind of let's take another shot at this and make

26:57.560 --> 27:02.440
something that could be possibly known as one of the cool places to get really good

27:02.440 --> 27:06.000
conversation and discussion around a story and links around Linux.

27:06.000 --> 27:10.080
One of the things that I am really thankful for for the community of our Linux Action

27:10.080 --> 27:15.280
Show is what an awesome collection of just good Linux news resources it is.

27:15.280 --> 27:16.280
Absolutely.

27:16.280 --> 27:21.560
Other Linux subreddits, but we always had the best stuff and sometimes first.

27:21.560 --> 27:23.920
And I love that about our Linux Action Show.

27:23.920 --> 27:25.280
I'd love to see that continued at Linux Unplugged.

27:25.280 --> 27:27.360
And it was like an organic, like, this is exciting to me.

27:27.360 --> 27:29.280
I want people to, you know, talk about this.

27:29.280 --> 27:30.280
Yeah.

27:30.280 --> 27:33.320
And I would love to also, speaking of things, I just really love to see for like our goals

27:33.320 --> 27:34.320
and our intentions for this.

27:34.320 --> 27:39.240
I like this is like my high point items is the conversation around these stories, insights,

27:39.240 --> 27:43.360
people's opinions, but like a good level discussion that is really kind of valuable and helps

27:43.360 --> 27:46.760
give people a better idea or thought or see a different perspective on a story.

27:46.760 --> 27:50.040
Doesn't have nothing that gets like all like flame worry, but just good discussion and

27:50.040 --> 27:55.640
context around stories can be so valuable and also help weigh how the community is interpreting

27:55.640 --> 27:56.640
the story.

27:56.640 --> 27:59.600
So I know if I doesn't always necessarily decide if you go on a show, but man, it helps

27:59.600 --> 28:01.800
our discussion in the show a whole bunch.

28:01.800 --> 28:05.600
So if you want to participate, reddit.com slash r slash Linux Unplugged.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.300
We also don't forget we have the other subreddits.

28:07.300 --> 28:12.260
We have our Jupiter Broadcasting, our Ask Noah, Koda Radio, Techsnap on Filter.

28:12.260 --> 28:14.320
They're all rocking and rolling too.

28:14.320 --> 28:15.320
Yeah.

28:15.320 --> 28:18.820
I'm really thinking it could be neat and maybe like in the next 200 episodes, this place

28:18.820 --> 28:21.160
will blow up too.

28:21.160 --> 28:22.160
Yeah.

28:22.160 --> 28:23.160
What do you think, Wes?

28:23.160 --> 28:24.800
You think it's crazy to launch a subreddit in 2017?

28:24.800 --> 28:25.800
Are we nuts?

28:25.800 --> 28:27.040
No, I think it makes sense.

28:27.040 --> 28:28.040
Does it?

28:28.040 --> 28:29.040
I'm a little worried we might have lost it.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.040
Maybe we've gone crazy.

28:30.040 --> 28:31.040
Maybe.

28:31.040 --> 28:32.040
I mean, we'll see.

28:32.040 --> 28:33.040
Right.

28:33.040 --> 28:34.040
We're taking a risk.

28:34.040 --> 28:35.040
We're going to try it again.

28:35.040 --> 28:36.040
Yeah.

28:36.040 --> 28:37.040
Yeah.

28:37.040 --> 28:38.040
Yeah.

28:38.040 --> 28:39.040
I suppose so.

28:39.040 --> 28:40.040
I suppose.

28:40.040 --> 28:41.040
I mean, the Mumble Room is always good.

28:41.040 --> 28:42.040
It's like a direct place to talk to us.

28:42.040 --> 28:44.520
If you want to be live, go to jblive.tv on Tuesdays.

28:44.520 --> 28:48.360
We're almost always live at 2 p.m. Pacific and we just kind of lock it there so that

28:48.360 --> 28:49.960
way you know when to join the Mumble Room.

28:49.960 --> 28:53.440
You can get it converted to your local time at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar

28:53.440 --> 28:59.480
and you can get in our chat room and if you do bang mumble, you'll get the server information

28:59.480 --> 29:00.480
and then you connect.

29:00.480 --> 29:03.880
We do mic checks and we ask that you have headphones on, you have like a headset or

29:03.880 --> 29:08.160
a good microphone or some kind that we can at least hear you clearly and then you get

29:08.160 --> 29:12.200
in and you can chat with us one-on-one.

29:12.200 --> 29:13.200
Yeah all right.

29:13.200 --> 29:15.680
So anyways, I made a post up on the, I don't really have much more to add, I guess that's

29:15.680 --> 29:16.680
kind of it.

29:16.680 --> 29:20.080
I made a post up on the Linux Action Show subreddit if you guys want to read more and

29:20.080 --> 29:21.840
I have the details in there.

29:21.840 --> 29:24.160
That is linked in the show notes.

29:24.160 --> 29:25.160
Yeah.

29:25.160 --> 29:27.120
So thank you everyone to our Linux Action Show.

29:27.120 --> 29:31.920
That has been such an awesome resource for not just Linux Action Show but also the Unplugged

29:31.920 --> 29:32.920
program.

29:32.920 --> 29:37.200
The discussions there have been helpful, the stories have been helpful and I ask that we

29:37.200 --> 29:40.960
take the best of all of it and we move to Linux Unplugged subreddit.

29:40.960 --> 29:43.480
We take the best and we do it all over again.

29:43.480 --> 29:46.400
I'm not afraid to start to build all over.

29:46.400 --> 29:48.640
Just bring it up from the beginning again Wes.

29:48.640 --> 29:57.160
Also be sure to check out linuxactionnews.com, no ww right now, just linuxactionnews.com.

29:57.160 --> 30:01.620
Subscribe to the RSS feed there because episode one will be landing very soon.

30:01.620 --> 30:05.240
There is a prototype beta episode over there, skip it.

30:05.240 --> 30:06.240
It's fine.

30:06.240 --> 30:10.360
But you know, it's Joe and I sitting down for the first time trying out a show and it

30:10.360 --> 30:11.360
went good.

30:11.360 --> 30:12.360
And so we're like, all right, we'll publish it.

30:12.360 --> 30:14.520
We have something to create the RSS feed around and we can start working with us.

30:14.520 --> 30:16.600
But it's not intended as the first episode.

30:16.600 --> 30:18.560
It's more like a concept pilot episode.

30:18.560 --> 30:19.560
Practice.

30:19.560 --> 30:21.900
It's over there but the RSS feeds are live now.

30:21.900 --> 30:26.400
The episode page is up at linuxactionnews.com so check that out.

30:26.400 --> 30:31.600
Also Wimpy, who couldn't join us today, he's traveling, but did get a chance to stop by

30:31.600 --> 30:35.200
Ask Noah live at Linux Fest Northwest.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.520
Did they have a good conversation?

30:36.520 --> 30:37.520
Oh yeah.

30:37.520 --> 30:38.520
Oh yeah.

30:38.520 --> 30:40.360
So that's in the latest episode of Ask Noah.

30:40.360 --> 30:44.160
I would also suggest you check that out if you haven't listened to Ask Noah yet because

30:44.160 --> 30:51.360
a really thought provoking conversation and if you are an Electron lover or hater, I would

30:51.360 --> 30:53.200
really encourage you to listen to Ask Noah.

30:53.200 --> 30:54.560
Here's another thing that's really nice about Ask Noah.

30:54.560 --> 30:59.360
You always know exactly how long it is because he's also broadcasting on the radio so it's

30:59.360 --> 31:02.840
always exactly the same length so it's easy to fit into your schedule.

31:02.840 --> 31:05.320
Ask Noah 6 live from Linux Fest Northwest.

31:05.320 --> 31:07.920
If you miss Wimpy on the Unplugged program, check that out.

31:07.920 --> 31:12.160
They had a great conversation and of course you can find him on the Ubuntu podcast too.

31:12.160 --> 31:14.960
It was so great to get to meet Wimpy in person.

31:14.960 --> 31:15.960
Yeah.

31:15.960 --> 31:19.120
That was one of my highlights of the Fest this year.

31:19.120 --> 31:21.400
And he really made the best out of the Fest.

31:21.400 --> 31:22.920
Turns out he's even more fun in person.

31:22.920 --> 31:23.920
Yeah.

31:23.920 --> 31:30.240
You know what's great about Wimpy is this is what I really appreciated about him.

31:30.240 --> 31:35.840
If you got an inclination that he's a pretty cool guy online, it's like that but way more

31:35.840 --> 31:36.960
in person.

31:36.960 --> 31:37.960
And that's what's so great.

31:37.960 --> 31:42.920
It's like when you meet somebody in person and they're even cooler than they seem online.

31:42.920 --> 31:44.740
Just a genuinely really great guy and a gentleman.

31:44.740 --> 31:47.840
So it was great to get to meet Wimpy in person and hang out with him for the weekend.

31:47.840 --> 31:49.480
Odyssey, you made it back too, huh?

31:49.480 --> 31:51.080
So you survived the long drive?

31:51.080 --> 31:52.080
Good job, man.

31:52.080 --> 31:53.080
Yes, indeed.

31:53.080 --> 31:54.080
That's great.

31:54.080 --> 31:57.400
You made it back just in time for the Hanford site to start to have an emergency so that's

31:57.400 --> 31:58.400
got to feel good.

31:58.400 --> 31:59.400
Yeah.

31:59.400 --> 32:05.840
Yeah, Albert made it out here too as well as a whole bunch of other people but we had

32:05.840 --> 32:09.440
a good time and it was a pretty cool Fest.

32:09.440 --> 32:14.160
We had a little bit of coverage of it in the Linux action show on last Sunday if you want

32:14.160 --> 32:15.160
to check that out.

32:15.160 --> 32:16.160
All right.

32:16.160 --> 32:22.120
So I want to cover what's going on at Canonical and I want to talk about what Mark Shallower

32:22.120 --> 32:25.760
said today and then I want to do our first hands on with Gallego Pro.

32:25.760 --> 32:30.120
So we have much more to come so I want to thank Ting for setting us up for the next

32:30.120 --> 32:37.760
bit of the show and you can go to linux.ting.com to sign up and get $25 off your Ting plan

32:37.760 --> 32:44.480
in credit or if you bring a device or if you need a device, you can get $25 off a device.

32:44.480 --> 32:49.520
Now consider my friends, this could also be an opportunity to get a very reasonable usable

32:49.520 --> 32:53.160
smartphone that maybe gets updates for a little bit, things like that because one of the great

32:53.160 --> 32:58.520
things about Ting is they don't stand in the way of security updates, they don't have any

32:58.520 --> 33:01.680
games to play, they don't have some image they have to lay on there or some sort of

33:01.680 --> 33:05.080
weird ass services that the OS has to support.

33:05.080 --> 33:09.720
They don't care how you use Ting, it's just use what you want and then you pay for it.

33:09.720 --> 33:13.920
Your minutes, your messages and your megabytes, whatever you use and that's what you pay.

33:13.920 --> 33:19.640
It's $6 for the line and that includes their awesome great customer service, their fantastic

33:19.640 --> 33:21.200
dashboard to manage it all.

33:21.200 --> 33:25.720
That includes all of the great perks of Ting like anything you would expect from a standard

33:25.720 --> 33:31.000
phone line because it is like your voicemail, your text messaging, picture messaging, hotspot,

33:31.000 --> 33:35.400
tethering, it's all in there for $6 a month plus your usage.

33:35.400 --> 33:41.320
It's so fantastic, the average monthly bill per device for Ting customers is $23.

33:41.320 --> 33:46.560
I've been a Ting customer for over two years, linux.ting.com, you go there, you sign up,

33:46.560 --> 33:49.320
you try them out and you see what I've been talking about.

33:49.320 --> 33:52.920
Also, really great, they have CDMA and GSM network.

33:52.920 --> 33:56.400
So whatever works better in your neck of the woods, you can use on Ting and if you go to

33:56.400 --> 33:59.440
another neck, you can use a different network if you need to.

33:59.440 --> 34:04.760
It's for somebody like myself who likes to go on road trips, killer freaking feature.

34:04.760 --> 34:09.840
Linux.ting.com and a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring this here unplugged program.

34:09.840 --> 34:12.460
Linux.ting.com.

34:12.460 --> 34:19.160
So Canonical is on the path to IPO which is the initial public offering for those of you

34:19.160 --> 34:23.800
who might not be familiar with the term and that means they become a public company with

34:23.800 --> 34:26.440
all of the responsibilities and duties therein, i.e.

34:26.440 --> 34:29.320
Obligations to make profits and things like that.

34:29.320 --> 34:33.200
This is confirmed by Mark Shalloworth at the OpenStack Summit.

34:33.200 --> 34:41.160
He said that they are pushing on, so this is in the shadow of course of the recent announcement

34:41.160 --> 34:45.400
that they're dropping investments in Unity 8, the phone and convergence and that Mark

34:45.400 --> 34:50.680
would be coming, would be regaining the CEO title, stepping in for Jane.

34:50.680 --> 34:56.300
This is big and this is going to be a fundamental shift in the gearing of Canonical.

34:56.300 --> 34:58.460
Do not misunderstand.

34:58.460 --> 35:00.920
This is a huge development.

35:00.920 --> 35:07.840
It's going to mean a realigning of the company's priorities, refocusing and Mark seems pretty

35:07.840 --> 35:09.480
fired up about this.

35:09.480 --> 35:12.400
Putting the company on the path to IPO, he said we must figure out what steps we need

35:12.400 --> 35:17.160
to take moving forward, focusing Canonical on its most profitable business lines.

35:17.160 --> 35:18.160
Ubuntu is not going to die.

35:18.160 --> 35:22.560
Ubuntu is the default platform on cloud computing in Juju and storage and OpenStack and on

35:22.560 --> 35:23.560
the edge.

35:23.560 --> 35:24.880
He says it's nearly unstoppable.

35:24.880 --> 35:28.940
We need to work out our IoT path and at the same time we had to cut out those parts that

35:28.940 --> 35:32.680
couldn't meet investors' needs.

35:32.680 --> 35:36.680
The immediate work is to get all of the parts of the company profitable.

35:36.680 --> 35:41.440
I mean that sounds like what they'll need to do in the future.

35:41.440 --> 35:48.240
So it's within that context that Mark was at OpenStack and The Cube, welcome to The

35:48.240 --> 35:52.640
Cube live from the OpenStack Summit conference, asked him this question here.

35:52.640 --> 35:57.760
The three legs of computing, personal computing, data center computing or cloud computing and

35:57.760 --> 36:04.400
the edge, the IoT world, which is neither data center nor personal, of those I had dreamed

36:04.400 --> 36:09.720
of Ubuntu as sort of going mainstream in all three, clearly Ubuntu is the de facto standard

36:09.720 --> 36:16.360
now for cloud computing and the data center and also I think arguably for the edge.

36:16.360 --> 36:21.400
Where we failed and I feel responsible for miscalculating effectively is our push into

36:21.400 --> 36:25.800
personal computing, phones, tablets, PCs.

36:25.800 --> 36:33.200
Where we failed was our push into personal computing, phones, tablets and PCs.

36:33.200 --> 36:34.840
And PCs.

36:34.840 --> 36:37.420
And PCs.

36:37.420 --> 36:44.200
Where we failed, our past tense, past tense, which I think is also pretty important there.

36:44.200 --> 36:50.000
And yikes, you know that to me sounds like a man who had a bit of a dream and that dream

36:50.000 --> 36:56.080
got crushed and now he's dealing with a new reality and he's just done with it.

36:56.080 --> 37:00.360
And you know he's like really, he calls it my miscalculation I think is what he said.

37:00.360 --> 37:05.160
Ubuntu is sort of going mainstream in all three, clearly Ubuntu is the de facto standard

37:05.160 --> 37:11.800
now for cloud computing and the data center and also I think arguably for the edge.

37:11.800 --> 37:16.840
Where we failed and I feel responsible for miscalculating effectively is our push into

37:16.840 --> 37:20.920
personal computing, phones, tablets, PCs.

37:20.920 --> 37:23.240
Wow.

37:23.240 --> 37:26.840
That's a strong statement and I think that is a statement that if you take it into its

37:26.840 --> 37:32.760
full entirety it obviously represents a lot of reflecting on Mark on this particular issue.

37:32.760 --> 37:37.980
And so the question is in this context in which he now views the landscape, where does

37:37.980 --> 37:39.480
desktop Linux fit in?

37:39.480 --> 37:43.320
Where does Ubuntu on desktop fit in?

37:43.320 --> 37:47.800
And so I think the desktop remains really important to us in support of developers who

37:47.800 --> 37:52.920
are really the lifeblood of free software and open source and IT innovation.

37:52.920 --> 37:58.040
But as a business we chose to focus on these two, the cloud where we are very strong and

37:58.040 --> 38:03.680
IOT where I think the story is only just beginning but again we're at the center of everything.

38:03.680 --> 38:08.120
So they're going to focus on the desktop for developers essentially, which means it sounds

38:08.120 --> 38:11.880
like a narrow focus like this is going to be our market.

38:11.880 --> 38:13.920
You know what's interesting about that statement?

38:13.920 --> 38:14.920
Sounds like Fedora workstation.

38:14.920 --> 38:15.920
No you meant something else.

38:15.920 --> 38:22.320
Hey, you made me clip again Wes, you made me clip again, you are getting me this week,

38:22.320 --> 38:23.320
you are getting me.

38:23.320 --> 38:24.720
I apologize guys, it's all Wes' fault.

38:24.720 --> 38:25.720
It's my fault.

38:25.720 --> 38:26.720
It's all Wes' fault.

38:26.720 --> 38:35.680
It was good Wes, no, now you made me forget because I was so good.

38:35.680 --> 38:42.760
No it reflects exactly what Dell told us when we were down there Dell said you know we kept

38:42.760 --> 38:46.200
trying Linux and we thought it was going to be like this low cost desktop, we thought

38:46.200 --> 38:51.120
it was going to be the cheap way to maybe take a hundred bucks off of a PC.

38:51.120 --> 38:53.920
So that's how we initially positioned it and it wasn't selling.

38:53.920 --> 38:54.920
We didn't understand.

38:54.920 --> 38:57.440
We didn't want these Celeron machines and these Atom machines.

38:57.440 --> 39:01.240
What they wanted was they wanted to develop on Linux and so once we started creating the

39:01.240 --> 39:05.880
Project Sputnik and we focused on developers specifically with Project Sputnik, we started

39:05.880 --> 39:06.880
selling like crazy.

39:06.880 --> 39:08.840
Now we have a hundred percent year-over-year growth.

39:08.840 --> 39:11.640
They're selling numbers that are just intense right?

39:11.640 --> 39:19.560
Now the reason why that I think it's interesting that Mark's sentiment and Dell sentiment lines

39:19.560 --> 39:21.940
up is because it must be reflected in sales numbers.

39:21.940 --> 39:26.960
The part that's disconnected from all of this for me is the thing that we hear over and

39:26.960 --> 39:32.680
over again is that Ubuntu is selling like crazy in India and China and that it's almost

39:32.680 --> 39:36.040
half of the PC sales over there or that you go into the stores and the half of the store

39:36.040 --> 39:39.900
are Ubuntu machines and half the store are Windows machines and that Ubuntu is extremely

39:39.900 --> 39:45.400
successful in India and in China and are all of those developers?

39:45.400 --> 39:48.560
No because then you're told that the story is well these are people that don't have a

39:48.560 --> 39:53.000
market bias so they're able to go in and you know assess the computer not based on Windows

39:53.000 --> 39:57.360
or Mac or Linux but just is it a computer and they're buying these Ubuntu machines and

39:57.360 --> 39:58.400
it's successful there.

39:58.400 --> 40:01.680
So it would seem like they also are getting quite a bit of successful in the totally new

40:01.680 --> 40:07.880
user market but and I hear that a lot but then when we talk about it now we're just

40:07.880 --> 40:08.880
going to focus on developers.

40:08.880 --> 40:15.240
Hang on Chris, aren't a lot of those installations just getting wiped for a pirate version of

40:15.240 --> 40:16.240
Windows straight away?

40:16.240 --> 40:21.280
Perhaps, Dell would say no but I don't know.

40:21.280 --> 40:22.280
I don't know.

40:22.280 --> 40:24.480
Of course they would.

40:24.480 --> 40:29.560
Maybe and so you think that's why they're so easily ready to just jettison that type

40:29.560 --> 40:30.560
of user?

40:30.560 --> 40:33.960
They're not real Ubuntu users?

40:33.960 --> 40:40.200
Well yeah and as for the developers well what's the whole subsystem for Linux on Windows all

40:40.200 --> 40:41.200
about?

40:41.200 --> 40:43.400
Isn't that about developers?

40:43.400 --> 40:45.360
Yeah seemingly so.

40:45.360 --> 40:52.080
Yeah that or yeah let's not go down that path because that leads to a dark path because

40:52.080 --> 40:54.120
there's so many other solutions for that.

40:54.120 --> 40:55.400
I'm getting a mixed message.

40:55.400 --> 40:59.800
I'll tell you what I'm getting a mixed message because it's while it's consistent from what

40:59.800 --> 41:04.760
Dell would tell you Project Sputnik is only representative of their success in the US

41:04.760 --> 41:05.760
market.

41:05.760 --> 41:10.840
Outside of the US they're just selling to average users and I think Canonical is saying

41:10.840 --> 41:12.000
we're not going to be targeting those users anymore.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.840
I mean it doesn't seem like there's a lot of glamour there.

41:13.840 --> 41:20.040
I don't know about the profitability or the business incentives but like does it seemingly

41:20.040 --> 41:23.400
they're placing the bet that it matters more to become you know completely adopted and

41:23.400 --> 41:29.100
ingrained in these IoT and cloud markets than it does to be the low-end desktop for a lot

41:29.100 --> 41:30.220
of the world.

41:30.220 --> 41:33.800
Or just that like is the return not that great like they already have you know they'll continue

41:33.800 --> 41:38.120
making an open source desktop that you can install if people want to use it if hardware

41:38.120 --> 41:42.100
retailers they are already using it you know what does it get them to continue to invest

41:42.100 --> 41:43.100
in it?

41:43.100 --> 41:48.000
And I think the thing that we will just have to wait and see in this whole story is and

41:48.000 --> 41:51.800
it's almost it's getting to the point now where it's starting to I think pass its prime

41:51.800 --> 41:58.560
and we can move on until things develop but how much of a desktop experience do they end

41:58.560 --> 41:59.560
up creating?

41:59.560 --> 42:06.520
Like we will see the priority that the desktop has inside Canonical will be represented in

42:06.520 --> 42:13.360
what we get as a product in 1710 and 1804 if there is a significant amount of tweaks

42:13.360 --> 42:17.880
or theming or you know you can define significant however you like but if there is an amount

42:17.880 --> 42:23.820
of tweaks or customizations or changes to make it more palatable in some some way out

42:23.820 --> 42:31.660
of the box that would seem to imply resources testing personnel i.e. effort.

42:31.660 --> 42:37.460
If it is stock Ubuntu GNOME with no changes really just hardly any you know we've just

42:37.460 --> 42:41.600
repackaged things up we put it in our repo and now we're going to give you security fixes

42:41.600 --> 42:45.600
that to me would suggest a low amount of effort and energy putting and personnel etc. put

42:45.600 --> 42:49.880
into the desktop and that's just the proof will just be as your buddy Bill says in the

42:49.880 --> 42:55.960
puddin it'll just be in the puddin right there in that puddin yeah under the skin yeah just

42:55.960 --> 42:57.600
just right there skin deep.

42:57.600 --> 43:01.320
Mini Mac I will give you one more chance to chime in go ahead yeah thanks.

43:01.320 --> 43:06.280
So I guess Ubuntu will stay the base for a lot of distributions and they will continue

43:06.280 --> 43:11.600
to publish a somehow default configuration for that system but it's not their primary

43:11.600 --> 43:17.120
goal remember China has its own Ubuntu distribution called Kalin right I don't know if I spell

43:17.120 --> 43:22.460
it right but it will stay the base for a lot of distributions we all love.

43:22.460 --> 43:27.060
That is a great point and I'm surprised I forgot about that because that's exactly that's

43:27.060 --> 43:32.120
exactly solves that problem doesn't it of course it makes much that that actually that

43:32.120 --> 43:38.200
fills in the gap Kailin or Kalin Kailin of course that's why that's okay.

43:38.200 --> 43:39.200
What is it?

43:39.200 --> 43:46.640
Chillin yeah chillin right chillin right thanks Joe it's chillin that is of course that fills

43:46.640 --> 43:51.280
in that gap so that's why there's something stepping up to fill that need of that makes

43:51.280 --> 43:56.800
sense so that that really you know what geez the more I think about this the more sense

43:56.800 --> 44:01.920
this makes I think Canonical is going to knock it out of the park I think I think I've never

44:01.920 --> 44:05.800
been tempted to invest in a company I don't know if I should or not but man I would be

44:05.800 --> 44:10.720
tempted to buy a few shares in Canonical because what has been the criticism of Canonical all

44:10.720 --> 44:14.300
along why can't they just focus like they have these things that make money but they

44:14.300 --> 44:18.440
just keep going off and doing this stuff and now that's exactly what Mark is doing he's

44:18.440 --> 44:24.300
narrowing things down he's going to go with what works and they these are profitable aspects

44:24.300 --> 44:28.600
of the business it's not like they have to figure out a way to make they're not Twitter

44:28.600 --> 44:33.020
they already make money they just were spending it on stuff that wasn't making money they're

44:33.020 --> 44:37.160
already going to make money there if you were an investor that wanted to get in on this

44:37.160 --> 44:41.340
market how could you not be interested in investing in the company behind the thing

44:41.340 --> 44:48.280
that runs the most on AWS and Azure and Rackspace and on private clouds like how could you not

44:48.280 --> 44:53.120
want to invest in that company that has a very solid IOT offering that's pretty much

44:53.120 --> 44:57.480
ready to go and already being used by companies like Dell I would be pretty much in on that

44:57.480 --> 45:02.960
if I if so it seems like a slam dunk and if they're going to let some of their other projects

45:02.960 --> 45:10.580
like Chillin or Ubuntu Mate or the Plasma you know Kubuntu slash Neon groups they can

45:10.580 --> 45:15.120
continue to serve those markets they can then now focus on the very thing that seems to

45:15.120 --> 45:20.520
be selling XPSs and HPs and system 76 machines and make a great desktop there if they put

45:20.520 --> 45:25.580
energy into it so they could be lined up for like a super home run like if they do this

45:25.580 --> 45:31.440
right this could be they could be the next Red Hat don't you think and only I think in

45:31.440 --> 45:35.120
some ways they're better positioned I don't know about revenue wise but they're better

45:35.120 --> 45:40.460
positioned in terms of deployment in all of these markets that are making all of the money

45:40.460 --> 45:46.440
right now seems like investors are going to go nuts go ahead but is it not the case they've

45:46.440 --> 45:50.720
invested all this money into the community stuff and the flavors and now it's kind of

45:50.720 --> 45:54.800
like they can just almost abandon the desktop to them and they've put enough investment

45:54.800 --> 45:59.320
in and they'll keep helping them but they don't need to pay developers so much anymore

45:59.320 --> 46:03.040
because they've got a bun to go home which is fine and they're basically saying we're

46:03.040 --> 46:09.080
just going to ship stock that as far as I understand it yeah I think that is smart it's

46:09.080 --> 46:12.400
what they can make a difference on what they make money yeah exactly and they probably

46:12.400 --> 46:16.120
only need to support the desktop as much as it helps their own dog food in an internal

46:16.120 --> 46:22.640
uses right it's going to be great I was I've been everybody coming up at Linux we've been

46:22.640 --> 46:25.920
talking about this stuff talking about it's been a really big pot I don't think anybody's

46:25.920 --> 46:29.620
ever talked about Ubuntu as much as they did this year it in fact in years past I've actually

46:29.620 --> 46:32.960
been like where's Ubuntu this year there was a booth this year people were talking about

46:32.960 --> 46:38.600
it was a big topic of conversation and what I realized was is damn did Joe and I pick

46:38.600 --> 46:43.600
a good time to launch Linux action news yeah no kidding it's like nailed that and user

46:43.600 --> 46:46.520
error we're gonna have a bunch of discussions and this show where the mumble room and you

46:46.520 --> 46:51.120
and I can chew on this stuff like we've it's never been better time to have shows to be

46:51.120 --> 46:54.320
launching shows right now around Linux to where we can actually talk about this stuff

46:54.320 --> 46:58.960
in a way that's really appropriate for the size of the topic and all that just I think

46:58.960 --> 47:03.120
it's going to be an ongoing interesting point and we're going to be watching a massive transition

47:03.120 --> 47:07.880
by a big player and I don't think I've ever felt better about their potential I think

47:07.880 --> 47:12.100
if you step back and look what they're doing here it's going to be the most sustainable

47:12.100 --> 47:15.960
long term for that company we all were sitting here waiting for them to pull the plug on

47:15.960 --> 47:21.480
the is and it really is sad that it means it's a lot of people are losing their jobs

47:21.480 --> 47:28.400
and I think we'll be hearing more about that pretty soon and it's you know it is a very

47:28.400 --> 47:32.480
unfortunate aspect of this story and I don't want to underplay it because some of those

47:32.480 --> 47:35.800
folks some of us probably know and you know so there really are some ambitious things

47:35.800 --> 47:38.800
that they were trying to do that would have been awesome if they could have if they could

47:38.800 --> 47:42.440
have super like I was just talking about how awful Android is imagine if Ubuntu Touch

47:42.440 --> 47:47.560
had come along and saved us from that like there was I know I know so I don't mean to

47:47.560 --> 47:51.080
underplay that aspect of it but at the same time we were all holding our breath hoping

47:51.080 --> 47:54.240
that this thing didn't run the company into the ground because it seemed to us on the

47:54.240 --> 47:59.520
outside like it was an intractable force to to defeat right so well we can be sad or

47:59.520 --> 48:03.400
miss some of these elements it's certainly better than a world that didn't have a bunch

48:03.400 --> 48:08.800
of it all mm-hmm yeah yeah so there you go the Ubuntu desktop will remain important but

48:08.800 --> 48:13.520
it sounds like it's gonna be more developer focused if I follow with Mark's Mark who had

48:13.520 --> 48:18.520
to say I OBG Ubuntu also had a write-up on that particular aspect of the interview and

48:18.520 --> 48:23.920
I have the entire interview where Mark also talks about taking over CEO roles again and

48:23.920 --> 48:27.280
some of the products are doing specifically for OpenStack that is also available in the

48:27.280 --> 48:32.920
show notes and you can read Joey's write-up at OMG Ubuntu hey Wes you know what I do from

48:32.920 --> 48:38.000
time to time in fact I was just doing it this morning creating droplets what creating droplets

48:38.000 --> 48:42.800
Wes I'd be creating droplets like other people be creating problems I got you're not using

48:42.800 --> 48:49.120
that API that mm-hmm Wes I'm all about that API I'll tell you what to I'm all about that

48:49.120 --> 48:53.800
dashboard yeah I like that dashboard what I love about digital ocean is somebody came

48:53.800 --> 48:57.120
to me today and they're like I need to do something like you know what we could spin

48:57.120 --> 49:00.840
that up on a droplet in no time it's so nice to know that you can get started within seconds

49:00.840 --> 49:07.440
you can do a full support totally like installed stack with Ubuntu LTS Docker and an application

49:07.440 --> 49:12.360
ready to go or you can deploy a base system and set it up yourself beginner expert you're

49:12.360 --> 49:15.680
gonna have no problems if you're messing around in the container space and you know quote

49:15.680 --> 49:19.300
unquote messing as in probably running your entire infrastructure on it now at this point

49:19.300 --> 49:26.960
hey oh you got you got it you got it you got guys it's no problemo at digital ocean digital

49:26.960 --> 49:31.160
ocean honey badger about containers in a way that's epic you ever done anything like that

49:31.160 --> 49:36.440
anything anything like that craziness like oh I don't know Wes Docker LXD containers

49:36.440 --> 49:41.560
on that they're digital ocean infrastructure with the SSDs and the bandwidths and the CPUs

49:41.560 --> 49:46.200
yeah it's amazing I know it's it's amazing yeah I got next cloud going I've even got

49:46.200 --> 49:53.480
I'll tell you what new fedora installs oh go check out digital oceans new fedora update

in a big thank you to digital ocean for sponsoring this here unplugged program digital ocean.com

51:16.520 --> 51:21.800
I did a little dramatic there at the end he did just for you speaking of things that are

51:21.800 --> 51:27.360
dramatic holy smokes am I excited about this Gallego Pro this thing is dramatic a dramatic

51:27.360 --> 51:31.640
design a dramatic flair look at where the power buttons that isn't that cool right on

51:31.640 --> 51:36.180
the side interesting I like it a lot so yeah I have a I've had the opportunity here at

51:36.180 --> 51:40.880
Linux fest Northwest to steal a Gallego Pro and get my hot grabby little hands on it so

51:40.880 --> 51:44.200
I've been trying it out for about 24 hours at this point so I'm not doing a review I'm

51:44.200 --> 51:48.360
just giving you first on first impression hands on and be an unboxing but it's already

51:48.360 --> 51:51.800
out of the box it never was in a box never was you know it's true what's true it does

51:51.800 --> 51:56.160
have quite a bit of ports which is really a crazy number of ports and I've been reliably

51:56.160 --> 52:01.500
informed that the USB-C port on this is a four PCI lane Thunderbolt USB-C port which

52:01.500 --> 52:06.320
is what you would need for for a full external GPU that would be slick yeah wouldn't that

52:06.320 --> 52:12.320
be interesting if that developed later on so this Gallego Pro here is I think a pre-production

52:12.320 --> 52:17.880
so I'm sort of doing like a like a like a like a early review kind of look at it and

52:17.880 --> 52:21.480
right now I've just kind of got the in bag in hand experience carrying it around for

52:21.480 --> 52:26.280
about 24 hours it's really nice because it goes right in the bag a little bit of extra

52:26.280 --> 52:30.360
room because it's you know it's like 13 not huge yeah screens really nice and vibrant

52:30.360 --> 52:34.460
I like I like the availability of the ports I'm I'm still trying to work out what the

52:34.460 --> 52:37.720
battery life is like because like I said I've just been messing around with it a little

52:37.720 --> 52:41.320
bit and I'm get I get different readings at different times so there's there's all that

52:41.320 --> 52:45.320
we just tried putting an arch on this thing so that'll be you know that looks like it

52:45.320 --> 52:48.520
woke up from suspension yeah yeah and we're gonna be of course putting Ubuntu back on

52:48.520 --> 52:52.880
this thing and putting the system 76 PPA on there and all that it's got an NVMe hard drive

52:52.880 --> 52:58.560
in there yeah yeah in fact I think it actually has capacity for a 2.5 inch as well oh that's

52:58.560 --> 53:02.440
kind of awesome two hard drives on this little thing which I think is really nice if you've

53:02.440 --> 53:10.940
got a bunch of clips you're editing or whatever HDMI display port USB 3.0 a and of course

53:10.940 --> 53:16.080
is that Ethernet uh-huh that's Ethernet right there's got a little door and they say it's

53:16.080 --> 53:19.760
their best latch yet on those you know those Ethernet ports that have the little latch

53:19.760 --> 53:23.160
on them they say it's their best their best latch you know that's not one of those features

53:23.160 --> 53:28.000
that's big for me but I you know talk about it I understand you know I understand that

53:28.000 --> 53:32.680
for some people that really is important oh my gosh I mean for me it's it's like fundamentals

53:32.680 --> 53:37.720
here because every day I'm copying gigabytes and gigabytes of footage around I think just

53:37.720 --> 53:44.400
for me like I'm okay with the like USB C or USB dock just because if I need to use it

53:44.400 --> 53:47.600
then like I'm gonna set it I don't like I'm not going to a data center where I have to

53:47.600 --> 53:51.560
go plug in some Ethernet thing but I get that people do yeah I mean that makes sense yeah

53:51.560 --> 53:54.960
if yeah if you were if you could just like if your workflow was like I'll just sit down

53:54.960 --> 53:59.240
the dock and you know but it does say a lot about system 76 that they've thought and put

53:59.240 --> 54:02.680
in the care to put that there because they understand their user base and that people

54:02.680 --> 54:07.400
really do want it yeah I mean this is essentially what I like about it is you get the advantages

54:07.400 --> 54:13.240
of a thin and light machine but no dongles required right ww you had a question is this

54:13.240 --> 54:20.160
part of the new systems 76 they're going to design it and make it themselves or not yet

54:20.160 --> 54:24.600
no not yet they're so they're going to do desktops first and I bet I would bet we would

54:24.600 --> 54:31.260
see that around the beginning of 2018 and then we will see laptops shortly or maybe

54:31.260 --> 54:34.600
depending on how it goes a little bit after that because you think about it it's two problems

54:34.600 --> 54:38.280
you have to solve right first you have to get the manufacturing plant up and going and

54:38.280 --> 54:42.400
get all the robotics and any personnel staffing that's needed things like that then you got

54:42.400 --> 54:46.840
to get once you get the supply pipeline you you kind of have to work out some of the kinks

54:46.840 --> 54:51.720
and to do your own custom laptop you then are also custom designing the motherboard

54:51.720 --> 54:55.240
and things like that and so I think they've got a they've got to work through all of those

54:55.240 --> 55:00.760
stages so this is this is from an upstream provider that they've heavily customized in

55:00.760 --> 55:05.840
fact they are the only OEM offering it in this specific configuration too so they do

55:05.840 --> 55:10.400
have an exclusive on their hands but they didn't design the all of the internal motherboard

55:10.400 --> 55:13.880
components and stuff like that yet but they do work with the with them like right now

55:13.880 --> 55:17.240
they're working on refining some of the firmware firmware cooling functionality and stuff like

55:17.240 --> 55:23.440
that you got to keep it cool you do yeah what'd you think of the keyboard when you were messing

55:23.440 --> 55:27.040
around with it so far it was pretty good yeah it would felt comfortable yeah I nice to type

55:27.040 --> 55:32.520
on yeah I really didn't mind it yeah I'd say the key travels actually pretty decent really

55:32.520 --> 55:37.560
especially for a laptop this thin it's got a core i7 in the thing too which is nice for

55:37.560 --> 55:42.720
a laptop of this size yeah I'm looking forward to trying this thing out and coming back with

55:42.720 --> 55:45.960
a with a full review yeah I think I'll really be curious to see especially since you've

55:45.960 --> 55:51.200
spent so much time with with X various XPS models and yeah Dell offerings and previous

55:51.200 --> 55:55.160
system 76 right yeah yeah I had a chance to play with it some to add Linux fast where

55:55.160 --> 55:59.640
they have their new theme and stuff on there yeah and so they had known three installed

55:59.640 --> 56:03.600
with their system 76 pop theme and whatnot I don't know if this is a consequence of the

56:03.600 --> 56:07.040
high dpi and the beautiful screen but the one they had at their booth at least for a

56:07.040 --> 56:12.360
little while the trackpad it was just not I think the acceleration wasn't turned up

56:12.360 --> 56:15.880
or what hadn't been tuned at all so that was a little bit like that was not the best experience

56:15.880 --> 56:19.240
that I had there so I'll be really curious what you think of it after after some time

56:19.240 --> 56:22.440
yeah wonder if they had it with a wonder if their system there had lib input or not that's

56:22.440 --> 56:27.920
yeah I'm not sure a big difference so speaking of system 76 and their gnome intentions Carl

56:27.920 --> 56:33.920
the man behind system 76 has posted essentially like a gnome manifesto if you will over on

56:33.920 --> 56:37.760
the system 76 blog and he writes home sweet gnome it's been a while but we're excited

56:37.760 --> 56:42.000
to be back and we've been playing with our new toy for the last few weeks he says they're

56:42.000 --> 56:46.280
gonna make a consistent theme that was born to desire when the desire to provide customers

56:46.280 --> 56:50.560
with a consistent experience all the way through the OS pop is bright and beautiful and very

56:50.560 --> 56:56.080
system 76 they're gonna have pop ship on their computers with a boon to in 1710 this October

56:56.080 --> 56:59.800
and they're already testing it obviously there's different things in here like they talk a

56:59.800 --> 57:04.400
little bit maybe about working with Katie connect the integrating Katie connect with

57:04.400 --> 57:09.320
gnome and potentially it sounds like he implies maybe some iOS support because he says in

57:09.320 --> 57:14.880
this post Katie connect only works with Android friends so I have to buy a new phone maybe

57:14.880 --> 57:18.800
we can do something about that kind of like hey yeah I don't know what that awesome yeah

57:18.800 --> 57:29.280
this though this one we got to talk about this one I'm really you know I'm not so sure

57:29.280 --> 57:34.280
about PPAs anymore I feel like the world is moving on anybody writes in here specifically

57:34.280 --> 57:40.840
a portion about PPAs you say system 76 delivers fixes themes and drivers via the system 76

57:40.840 --> 57:45.680
PPA which is a boon to his personal package archive when a book to upgrades from one distribute

57:45.680 --> 57:51.360
version from one distribution version to the next it disables PPAs the stopping customers

57:51.360 --> 57:58.200
from receiving updates to their products disabling makes sense for unmaintained PPAs but for

57:58.200 --> 58:05.640
maintained PPAs there should be a mechanism to keep them active we will submit patches

58:05.640 --> 58:12.460
for update manager that adds a config file to allow listed PPAs to remain active during

58:12.460 --> 58:18.080
a release upgrade he says that we think other OEMs partners and projects will appreciate

58:18.080 --> 58:22.600
this functionality as well the only thing is that I'm reading there which kind of sets

58:22.600 --> 58:28.640
off like a worry for me here is it sounds like they're gonna fork update manager and

58:28.640 --> 58:31.560
even if it's a small fork like but they're gonna they're gonna have their own version

58:31.560 --> 58:35.720
of update manager that checks a config file and then they will submit that upstream and

58:35.720 --> 58:43.000
if OEMs or Ubuntu want to take that on they can the the the issue I would have with that

58:43.000 --> 58:52.560
is what at what point does it stop becoming Ubuntu so if you have a PPA a persistent PPA

58:52.560 --> 58:59.520
that persists through upgrades and you're applying fixes and patches to it between upgrades

58:59.520 --> 59:04.160
is that still Ubuntu then is that or is that more like system 76 to which might be a good

59:04.160 --> 59:11.280
idea as well maybe that's a good idea system 76 because I I I have found that the you know

59:11.280 --> 59:16.160
in total the disabling of PPAs is a better practice than keeping them enabled between

59:16.160 --> 59:22.000
upgrades in in whole now the idea here of course the system 76 could test and fix things

59:22.000 --> 59:25.600
before they ever ship it right but it seems like you could still end up with a window

59:25.600 --> 59:30.880
where customers are jumping on board they're upgrading before the PPA is ready then they

59:30.880 --> 59:35.440
and it doesn't get properly disabled and things get broken I mean it seems like this so this

59:35.440 --> 59:39.360
is the one part of all of this strategy I'm like this seems like there could be a little

59:39.360 --> 59:45.380
derivative of Ubuntu happening here there could be some upgrade shenanigans but if they

59:45.380 --> 59:49.700
manage it correctly and they test it which they do a lot of testing they should be able

59:49.700 --> 59:54.440
to hammer out I'd say 90% of the issues so it should be doable but it does sort of red

59:54.440 --> 59:58.520
raise a little bit of red flag and I do understand why they why they would want that right like

59:58.520 --> 01:00:02.440
especially for users like yeah I'm gonna update and but don't know enough to go you know check

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:05.940
out their PPA list or their sources list or anything like that to be like oh well why

01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:11.940
don't why don't I get the new themes or the you know whatever yeah I would wonder too

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:14.880
I would if it would become less of a problem so it sounds like they're gonna upstream a

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:19.880
lot of stuff mm-hmm and so if folks upstream just accepted some of these patches in then

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:23.060
they could reduce the amount of stuff they have to shove in the PPA over time to sort

01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:28.440
of sort of negating the issue over time maybe yeah but that would depend on upstream

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:32.520
picking them up but anyways if you're curious about what they're going with gnome this is

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:37.200
really interesting and they they toss in some details about the pop theme which I think

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:41.840
this is gonna be really cool to see system 76 get behind their own theme here and really

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:47.140
do something different because it it obviously could be used by other folks that aren't using

01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:51.360
system 76 machine so you could just end up having a well-known hardware OEM that's that's

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:54.440
keeping a theme alive that just ends up being a really well like theme on the gnome desktop

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:58.360
which could be pretty cool too we'll see because people are liking it the pop theme

01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:03.400
is pretty it's pretty good it's forked from a couple of other themes from I think both

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:09.000
a main gnome theme and also an icon theme and all that stuff I think I think we think

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:14.200
we had details about that in a previous show but we say goodbye to unity 8 and the and

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:18.000
the dreams of what that had and we say hello to different folks's take now on the Ubuntu

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:23.360
gnome desktop system 76 is definitely taking a leap here because we don't we don't really

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:27.800
even know what canonical is gonna do with their gnome yet so there we've heard more

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:31.420
from system 76 than just about anyone else yeah they're really they're really they're

01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:35.600
really going at it full speed and you know it's more than just words because they had

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:39.960
a gal go pro like I said at Linux fest running this stuff they're talking about right here

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:45.940
so they're testing and dogfooding it at system 76 right now and I was asking folks at the

01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:49.560
booth at system 76 as they walked up like what do you think what do you think what do

01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:52.840
you think and you know different people had different takes on it obviously because it's

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:56.880
always a taste thing it's always you know people have different opinions on that but

01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:00.760
it's definitely a very eye-catching theme and on high dpi it really looks sharp yeah

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:07.080
you get a good monitor so what do you think ww interesting times ahead oh yeah I mean

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:13.800
like like canonicals doing their move system 76 is kind of like going hey we're gonna up

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:21.120
our game and be you know evolving how we make these things and this could be an interesting

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:26.840
time to see how these two different companies have worked so close together either go step

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:31.360
separately or they still work or you know things like that it'll be interesting to see

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:37.880
sure yeah because what happens say if in 1804 it comes out that well we have this new Ubuntu

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:41.840
human theme for gnome and we're really happy with it and it's got all of our energy and

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:45.120
effort into this and this is what we think the Ubuntu desktop should look like then what

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:48.680
system 76 gonna do I would imagine they'll probably stick with their look because now

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:53.840
this is gonna be part of their branding switch to KDE yeah actually I think this is clever

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:57.920
on their part is I think what their plan is if I remember right now I suppose all this

01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:04.280
is subject to change but I think they're gonna have like a login menu entry item on like

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:11.160
light DM or GDM that says system 76 gnome session or stock gnome session so if you don't

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:14.240
want any of this stuff yeah you just choose that and then you just get the whatever the

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:19.160
stock Ubuntu gnome session is which is kind of like a kind of like a best of both worlds

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:21.880
yeah that's a good way yeah as long as it's not confusing for people that sounds pretty

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:26.600
nice yeah so if you have questions about the galago pro tweet me at Chris LAS and let me

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:30.440
know what they are and I'll try to work them into see if you can get him to run a fork

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:36.400
bomb yeah yeah maybe that's probably not what I'm gonna do but yeah I think probably I'll

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:39.800
have it I'll probably have my review ready by the next Linux unplugged oh cool yeah I'm

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:43.040
gonna just only gonna run arch on it for a couple of days and then I'm gonna load Ubuntu

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:47.280
with the system 76 PPA on there and give and that'll really what the majority of the review

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:52.240
is and I would imagine by that I'll have a better idea of laptop battery life and the

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:56.800
other thing I want to test is what's laptop battery life before I put things like TLP

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:59.920
on there and what's blacktop battery what kind of improvement are you able to get here

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:04.100
and I'm not gonna I probably won't come back with like exact numbers because it's always

01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:07.760
it's so varied based on workload and it's not like I have some sort of stringent regime

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:11.280
for battery testing so I'll just give you my impressions on it but I'll try to do my

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:15.680
best job so we'll probably have that question for you yeah yeah sure I've got a question

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:20.960
for you about the Gallego Pro could you please do me a favor and try and spin up the latest

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:26.360
alpha of Trisco I think it's Trisco 8 and see what works and what doesn't because look

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:30.400
I'm not going to use Trisco you're not going to use Trisco but if you spin it up and everything

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:35.760
works then that's a nice warm feeling isn't it that okay it's running Libre software the

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:40.280
graphics doesn't work if the Wi-Fi doesn't work then it tells you okay it's working in

01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:47.080
Ubuntu Fedora arch but it's using some binaries and then at least we'll know that a blob informal

01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:50.560
blob count yeah so put the latest Trisco on there and see what happens I can do I'll give

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:56.120
it a spin yeah that's a good idea thanks Joe if you and of course of course if you are

01:04:56.120 --> 01:05:00.960
particularly interested join us in the mumble room next week and answer your question directly

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:04.440
otherwise tweet me at Chris Elias I'll try to get some of them in there and if you want

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:12.040
to get the pop theme I suspect there's if you're on Ubuntu on 1704 or 1604 you can get

01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:19.440
the pop theme in unity or known by adding their PPA now this PPA I think this PPA I

01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:22.800
think is just the pop theme but I'm not sure so just double check on all of that it's all

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:27.640
they have all the information in the blog post as well as links to the github repo which

01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:34.560
I think so adaptia or adapt a was the original theme and paprias and Fira if I'm getting

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:40.600
those names right where the upstream projects that they've sort of forked from and I think

01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:45.600
they're contributing back up to those projects also yeah so check it out we have the post

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:49.400
in the show notes and congrats to some 76 for getting that out there and getting the

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:52.920
galago pro close to shipping it seems like there's a lot of excitement around there there

01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:56.040
was also a lot of discussions there you know one of the other things I don't know if I

01:05:56.040 --> 01:06:00.360
mentioned it's just one more Linux fest this is like littered with throughout the show

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:07.240
one more Linux fest observation was a lot of new users at Linux fest this year yeah

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:13.520
wasn't that wild yeah folks it didn't yet run Linux and so as a consequence the Linux

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:17.640
like 101 courses where the standout hit I was right as I was going out the door I talked

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:20.280
to the Linux fest organizers and I said so what were the big you know what were the big

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:24.120
talks what was everybody what was all the feedback and he said the 101 courses you know

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:30.240
those Linux newbie courses were great and in fact while we were at the booth during

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:36.800
those courses we had people stopping by the booth going yeah well I went to the 101 class

01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:41.240
but it's standing and people are out the door in a line and there's just there's too many

01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:44.840
people in there it's hot so I had to leave so I think they'll probably expand that next

01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:48.040
year so do you have to lay some Linux 101 on something yeah we just quizzed him real

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:53.200
quick I said call it Linux Academy I think it's a good sign that people that were just

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:57.560
genuinely just interested in technology but weren't yet Linux users were there there were

01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:01.760
more of everyone there was there was kids there yeah my kids include but there were

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:05.960
more kids there this year than normal I think in my impression of course I don't have hard

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:09.520
numbers but it seems like I've never seen as many women there as I saw which is it was

01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:12.600
a great sign and like I said new users which is a great sign and of course Brad which was

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:19.200
great yeah the diverse crowd great great great presenters good booths just just a great fest

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:23.200
overall and he said I didn't have official numbers by the time I was leaving but he said

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:26.760
it's probably their biggest one yeah that's awesome yeah yeah and boy did it show in that

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:31.880
Expo Hall and what oh my gosh I have to tell this story and maybe I'll try to get it in

01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:37.340
my vlog because it was it was so cool and I did have my vlogging camera with me but

01:07:37.340 --> 01:07:44.280
they had a gaming den yeah and it was the most badass gaming den I had ever seen so

01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:48.620
they they were all playing when I went up there Rocket League and so all of the machines

01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:53.800
were running Ubuntu all had Steam with Rocket League and then they had in this on the projector

01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:58.040
because it's like a big college classroom on the projector they had spectator view where

01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:02.640
you could see everyone playing so you could see the entire court awesome they had an elimination

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:06.400
hierarchy scoreboard where you could see who won and who was getting eliminated and who

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:12.240
was still the champion they had prizes they had great prizes they were giving away I mean

01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:15.320
I couldn't find the gaming den at first and I started hearing all the hooting and hollering

01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:20.760
I just went that direction and it was high-energy a ton of fun super well organized and you

01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:24.160
know you really go in there and you see all these folks that are new to Linux and they're

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:27.080
just sitting down playing video games like it's no big deal like of course it that's

01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:30.540
awesome of course Steam is on here and they just sit down there's there's like you didn't

01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:34.640
see people going like oh what do I do they just like click the Steam icon okay Rocket

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:37.840

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:41.400
playing he's never used Unity before he just sits downstairs playing launches Steam like

01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:47.880
this is so cool it was really the face we want to put up for new users like good effort

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:53.320
look a fun spirited they also had a robotics area where school kids have been building

01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:58.840
robots and they have this robot that shot balls and ran a Raspberry Pi that was running

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:04.000
Linux that did the optical image recognition so we could recognize objects in real time

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.080
and so it was a remote-controlled robot that would go and have some autonomy for a short

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:12.280
period of time while it recognized objects and then return control back to the remote

01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:17.080
user built by freaking students and up there up there own in one of the rooms up at Linux

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:22.320
Fest on the second floor so there was really cool stuff tucked around too it was neat and

01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:27.160
Sunday was way busier than any past Sunday and yeah it was like a whole other Saturday

01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:31.240

say goodbye Wes goodbye

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:49.480
so did you did you hear the big news the big news with Amazon echo and Alexa you can use

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:54.400
your voice to play music control smart home devices and get news and information yeah

01:11:54.400 --> 01:12:01.600
and now introducing the newest member of the family Amazon echo show hi there this is Doug

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:05.040
first time dad yeah we'll stop there because it's just starts getting patronizing after

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:11.120
that but did you see the news the yeah what do you think of the echo show Wes it looks

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:15.440
kind of I can see why they're doing it I don't know that I'm interested in it yeah they really

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:18.880
push the video calling really really pushing that and I'm like okay is there a time where

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:23.080
video calling is ever actually gonna become like a thing that people do a lot I don't

01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:27.600
know I mean ever I actually think I think FaceTime actually is pretty it's pretty successful

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:31.200
you know if you're gonna go for that but yeah I know it's like I can see it for a long you

01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:36.000
know family people you see infrequently yeah meetings yeah sure but like for day to day

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.920
I don't know they also introduced something else kind of new which I actually am excited

01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:46.440
about because I've got a couple of these devices and this is supposedly rolling out today Alexa

01:12:46.440 --> 01:13:08.440
call dad again calling dad oh boy what did you do Alexa answer Alexa hang up calling

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:12.480
through the echo devices is actually kind of useful because I've got some here in the

01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:16.600
studio I've got some and they also have a messaging feature so you know it doesn't have

01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:20.960
to be a call you can leave a message for specific individuals and it'll play that's actually

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:26.340
not a bad feature I think so people that are people and the thing is is again Amazon builds

01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:29.800
this lady in a tube once and sells it to you and then they just keep piling these services

01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:34.400
that is their way isn't it whoo welcome to the future West what actually other Alexa

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:39.160
devices right for the yeah oh yeah yeah of course yeah but they're Alexa send message

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:47.200
to link to map for like what I can't find it products for gorilla masks yeah I mean

01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:54.760
there's gonna be weirdness about it but the the thing about the whole echo strategies

01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:59.920
the echo themselves are Amazon's versions of the Alexa enabled product but there are

01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:04.880
many other products like GE just launched a lamp a really cool looking expensive lamp

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:10.280
that but so cool like you kind of would want it that also oh by the way has Alexa built

01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:37.080
into it right cancel
