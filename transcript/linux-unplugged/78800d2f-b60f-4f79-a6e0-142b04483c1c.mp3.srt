1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
Ladies and gentlemen, arriving in the studio

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,960
is our brand new PinePhone Braveheart Edition.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,320
Mr. Westpane, would you care to do the unboxing, sir?

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,120
Ooh, I love this.

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,760
I mean, even on the side, model, PinePhone,

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,120
Linux smartphone, how cool is that?

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,440
That's exactly what I want.

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,040
I know, it is so cool.

9
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,840
Now, truth be told, I've already taken it out of the box

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,280
once and played around with it a little bit,

11
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,120
but it's bigger than you'd expect, isn't it?

12
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,040
It is, but it's shiny.

13
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,080
I mean, it looks like a phone.

14
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,560
Yeah, it looks like a legit phone,

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,760
and it feels really good in the hand,

16
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,320
a lot better than I was expecting.

17
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,280
How about that?

18
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,000
Wow, nice finish on the back, smooth.

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,800
USB-C.

20
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,080
USB-C port right there on the bottom.

21
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,560
You know, it's maybe a little thicker

22
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,560
than some phones I'm used to, but not much.

23
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,480
I mean, I could be way off, but it feels no bigger or thicker

24
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,920
than, say, like the Nexus 6, yes, or whatever it was.

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,880
You're absolutely right.

26
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,960
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

27
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,120
It's real.

28
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,720
And when you hold it in the hand,

29
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,000
you have a real appreciation of the feat that

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,520
has just been pulled off here.

31
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,480
It even has a headphone port.

32
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:17,840
Hello, friends, and welcome in to your Unplugged program,

33
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,520
episode 340.

34
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,280
My name is Chris.

35
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,040
My name is Wes.

36
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,480
Hello, Wes.

37
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,480
This is really exciting.

38
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,040
I've been looking forward to episode 340,

39
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,880
and I didn't expect you to bring this entire taco plate.

40
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,280
This is really nice.

41
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,640
You know, I will apologize.

42
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,360
We will be eating some tacos during the show.

43
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,080
You know, it is episode 340, and that's how we're celebrating.

44
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,720
These look so tasty.

45
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,280
But on the show today, we have a lot of community news

46
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,800
to get into, including a brand new community news subsegment,

47
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,920
the first ever on the Unplugged program.

48
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,600
I've been on burnout still.

49
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,560
We've gotten some more feedback.

50
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,200
Our friends from elementary OS are here

51
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,200
to talk about the App Center and the success

52
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,800
of their fundraiser, and then we'll

53
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,560
wrap it up with some highlights from Fosdome 2020.

54
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,320
Pretty nice, Wes.

55
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,400
This is a giant show.

56
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,160
Pretty nice.

57
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,600
And of course, we have a slammed mumble room today.

58
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,560
Time appropriate greetings, virtual lug.

59
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,440
Hello.

60
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,840
Hello.

61
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,880
Hello.

62
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,760
Howdy.

63
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,280
Hey.

64
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,320
This is a record breaker.

65
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,840
That is definitely a record breaker.

66
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,960
This is so awesome.

67
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,280
Hello, everybody.

68
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,920
Ace, Nomad, Brent, Byte, Carl, Cassidy, Dan, Drifter, Dusty,

69
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,960
Frank, John, Colonel, MarioGrip2, MiniMech, Nervo, Steve,

70
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,200
and TechMav are just in the main on air.

71
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,080
And then there's a whole other group up in the quiet listening.

72
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,880
But also, a big, warm welcome back to Mr. Bacon.

73
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,440
Hey, Cheesy.

74
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,120
How you doing?

75
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,200
Hey, everybody.

76
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,040
I'm doing good, man.

77
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,240
Glad to be back.

78
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,160
We missed you.

79
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,360
Good to have you back.

80
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,480
Glad you're up and at least going enough

81
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,720
to join us on the show today because there's

82
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,720
a ton for us to get into.

83
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,720
And one of them is installed right here on my machine

84
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,960
right now, Wes.

85
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,560
Plasma 5.18 is out.

86
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,640
It's a doozy.

87
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,280
It's an LTS, which, of course, stands for Long Term Support.

88
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,440
Yeah, that means 5.18 will be updated and maintained

89
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,560
by the KDE contributors for the next two years.

90
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,480
Regular versions are just four months.

91
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,440
Boom.

92
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,600
So this is an overall continuing improvement to the look.

93
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,600
Better support for GTK applications

94
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,240
using client-side decorations.

95
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,080
And as well, I mean, I guess if you're coming,

96
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,120
thinking about this, if you're coming from the past LTS

97
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,960
release of Plasma, which was 5.12, which shipped in Kubuntu,

98
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,440
you have a totally new notification system,

99
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,280
all new web browser integration, new lock screen,

100
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,720
totally redesigned system settings panel,

101
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,200
totally new display management, including

102
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,400
what's it called, fractional scaling support in there,

103
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,720
flap hack support in Discover, night color features,

104
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,400
Thunderbolt device support.

105
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,800
It's a huge, huge, huge upgrade if you're

106
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,240
coming from the past LTS.

107
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,820
Still pretty good if you're coming just

108
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:00,920
from the previous release, though.

109
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,320
There's some nice things in there.

110
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,280
Oh, yes.

111
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,160
OK, so you mentioned fractional scaling.

112
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,200
That's now a lot less glitchy on X11.

113
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:08,960
Glitchy, you say.

114
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,600
Oh, yeah.

115
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,160
Less glitchy.

116
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:10,880
You don't want that.

117
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,440
I don't want glitches.

118
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,220
I mean, I'm not promising it's glitch-free,

119
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,360
but significantly less glitchy, let's say.

120
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,800
Hey, Wes, what's a glitch?

121
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,440
Oh, you've never encountered that.

122
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,280
I mean, what is it?

123
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,120
Like, technically, what is a glitch?

124
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,120
What is a glitch?

125
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,960
I don't know what a glitch is.

126
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,480
Are they talking about bugs?

127
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,600
Do they mean it's less buggy?

128
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,080
Is that what they mean?

129
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,040
What does a glitch mean?

130
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,680
A sudden, usually temporary malfunction or irregularity

131
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,400
of equipment.

132
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,080
Oh, a bug.

133
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,320
OK, OK, good, less bugs.

134
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:36,840
That's good.

135
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,560
Less bugs.

136
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,200
That's good.

137
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,280
Fewer bugs, probably is what Joe wants you to say.

138
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,000
Fewer bugs.

139
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,880
If you have an NVIDIA GPU, that info is now in case discard.

140
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,320
Hey, that's pretty handy.

141
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,240
And my favorite, a redesigned audio volume system widget.

142
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,240
I love that.

143
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,680
And Joey over at OMG Ubuntu has a really nice write-up

144
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,240
that I think is a little bit better

145
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,760
than the official write-up.

146
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,680
But that's not bad.

147
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,360
It's just Joey really did a great job of summarizing it.

148
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,000
So we'll link to that.

149
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,360
There's just another bit of hardware news to get into,

150
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,680
and that is this monster of a Thaleo desktop

151
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,760
that System76 launched.

152
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,400
It's a whole new line that's powered

153
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,920
by these brand new Ryzen Threadripper CPUs.

154
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,800
Yeah, so it's actually launched in conjunction

155
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,160
with these new Ryzen Threadripper 3990X.

156
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,840
And with that, we have the Thaleo Major R2,

157
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,760
which has those Threadripper CPU options.

158
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,080
And wow, there's a lot in here.

159
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,840
Yeah, so the base configuration starts 16 gigs of RAM,

160
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,000
250 gigabyte NVMe.

161
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,560
I said that right this time, right?

162
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:40,840
Didn't I?

163
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,320
Yes.

164
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,560
It's a graphics 550 and a 1,000-watt power supply.

165
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,160
But you can get the thing pretty loaded.

166
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,240
Yeah, I think these specs might be more suitable to you, Chris.

167
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,400
64-core Threadripper, 256 gigs of DDR4 RAM,

168
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,360
and 46 terabytes of storage.

169
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,040
I'm sorry, what?

170
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,200
Yeah, that's three NVMe SSDs and eight SATA drives.

171
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,840
I'm sorry, did you say how many terabytes of storage?

172
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,480
46.

173
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,480
OK.

174
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,000
On the graphics side, you can also

175
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
have dual NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 TIs.

176
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,640
I'm going to go configure one right now.

177
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,720
So I'll get a 64-core Threadripper system possibly.

178
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,480
Let's see, I'll start with, realistically,

179
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,160
I don't need 64 cores.

180
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,040
I'd probably be happy.

181
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,480
I could probably live with 24 cores.

182
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,320
Plenty of cores.

183
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,360
Probably.

184
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,360
I would like 32 gigs of RAM, but I actually

185
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,000
don't know if I need much more than that.

186
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,880
But think about that.

187
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,920
You're going to have the system for a long time.

188
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,840
I agree, but I have been surprised at the systems that

189
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,880
have 16 gigs of RAM.

190
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,120
I'm still getting work done.

191
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,000
It's a little tight, and the ones that have 32 and 64

192
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,240
feel about the same to me.

193
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,800
You're so reasonable.

194
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,280
But that 250-gig NVMe has to go.

195
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,600
Yeah, think of all the things you're

196
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,360
going to be doing on a system like this.

197
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,320
That's going to be a lot of large files.

198
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,040
Two terabytes on that sucker.

199
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,880
You can get an additional one.

200
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,520
I think I won't.

201
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,960
I think instead I'll do 2.5 storage,

202
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,800
and I'll go with a two-terabyte SSD for that one.

203
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,480
Oh, they offer just spinning rust, too.

204
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,480
All right, I'll do that.

205
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,560
I'll do a 500-gigabyte solid-state spinning rust.

206
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,600
I'm going to go pretty realistic on the old GPU.

207
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,320
I just love how the form is set up,

208
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,240
because the header is first GPU.

209
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,320
Yeah, that's true, right?

210
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,640
I'm going to go reasonable here.

211
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,720
I don't think I have to go crazy with the GPU.

212
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,680
I don't need a whole bunch of GPUs,

213
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,920
but I want this thing to play a decent amount of games.

214
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,360
So I'm going to go an RX 5700.

215
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,240
It's not the best I could do, but it'll work.

216
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,360
I don't need a second GPU.

217
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,960
I'm not going to get a display.

218
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,920
I'll stick to the base warranty to try to keep costs down.

219
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,200
And Westpac, can you read that final price there?

220
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,760
No, I can't.

221
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,520
Oh, yeah, $4,870.

222
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,120
That is a lot less than I was expecting.

223
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,360
It's not to say that it's not a lot of money,

224
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,080
but I think the Mac Pro just totally reset my expectations.

225
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,560
This thing would be no slouch.

226
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,800
I mean, I only got the 24-core version and 2 terabytes

227
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,440
of storage.

228
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,600
And I mean, dang, man.

229
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,760
And I mean, that's before you get to the whole,

230
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,040
it's made right here in the States,

231
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,320
and it's all kinds of open.

232
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,000
Oh, yeah, I'm not even making a comparison in that regard.

233
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,720
I'm just saying I think they're getting the pricing right,

234
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,640
and it's a really nice system for what you get.

235
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,000
And it looks like they've updated the cooling system

236
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,480
in there a little bit since the original Thalios that we saw.

237
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,040
Yes, and I mean, yeah, that's a totally reasonable amount,

238
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,520
especially for a business buying this for an employee.

239
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,960
Yeah, or me buying it for myself.

240
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,800
No, that's not true.

241
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,280
I just don't need that much power.

242
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,280
I don't need it.

243
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,160
Not yet.

244
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,160
Well, it looks like they did change the CPU intake

245
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:51,000
to include another die-cut kind of almost a Linux unplugged

246
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,640
rocket along the side of it.

247
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,160
That's cool.

248
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,160
And underneath it there, it looks

249
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,560
like some additional Morse code.

250
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,120
I don't know what it says, but they

251
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,720
are pretty cool about hiding little Easter eggs all

252
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,600
throughout their cases and stuff, too.

253
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,720
It probably says linuxunplug.com slash RSS.

254
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,600
Probably does.

255
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,040
It should.

256
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,400
All right, I promised it earlier,

257
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,840
we have a new subsegment here in the community news.

258
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,800
Ladies and gentlemen, I am proud to announce

259
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,760
the launch of Rustwatch.

260
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:32,960
I think that the sound clips guy you hired

261
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,560
is taking this job a little too seriously.

262
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,560
That was a little much.

263
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,560
Got to have him dial it down a little bit.

264
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,040
Well, it's the first time for this segment,

265
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,200
and you've been begging to add this to the show for weeks.

266
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,200
That was a lot, though.

267
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,240
That's a hell of an intro.

268
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:43,880
I know.

269
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,440
It's sort of too much.

270
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,240
Well, anyways, Rustwatch starts out with a fork of core boot.

271
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,880
This is going to be the pitch for Rustwatch.

272
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,960
What is getting rewritten in Rust this time around?

273
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,800
And this time, it's core boot, and the project

274
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,840
is called OrBoot.

275
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,600
You get it?

276
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,240
I love that name, personally.

277
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,920
And it currently plans to support Linux boot payloads.

278
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,680
Wes, why are we doing this?

279
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,560
You've got to rewrite everything in Rust, right?

280
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,880
There is some logic to it.

281
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,480
The whole point about Rustwatch is

282
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,400
to have some fun with the fact that it's like the new hotness,

283
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,720
but there is reason for it.

284
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,720
It is a safer language for maybe things like this.

285
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,120
And there's lots of the nice modern tool chain

286
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,680
that you have access to.

287
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,520
And in some cases, doing things again,

288
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,000
well, they can end up better designed,

289
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,320
learning from the past mistakes.

290
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,120
Sure, sure.

291
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,640
But it's not all roses here in the Rustwatch subsegment.

292
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,960
There's also some concerns about Rust infringing

293
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,120
on people's freedoms.

294
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,040
Of course, we have the four essential freedoms

295
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,280
and freedom number three is being imposed upon.

296
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,960
Here is the post from the hyper wiki they have.

297
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,720
Rust and also Cargo, the Rust package manager,

298
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,720
violates freedom to redistribute without their explicit

299
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,480
approval.

300
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,300
Their trademark license imposes requirements

301
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,400
for distributions of modified versions

302
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,720
that make it inconvenient to exercise freedom three.

303
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,400
And this has turned into a bit of a conversation that

304
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,200
has kind of taken a turn of, well,

305
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,440
the problem is distros can just take up our packages,

306
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,520
modify them, and call them the same thing.

307
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,160
And now this is the argument.

308
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,040
The distros want to be able to package it up

309
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,680
and call it Rust.

310
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,840
They don't want them to call it Rust without their approval

311
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,480
because they want to make sure it truly

312
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,760
is genuine their product.

313
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,800
Right.

314
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,600
An example might be if you were to strip out

315
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,400
the borrow checker, for example, which

316
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,360
is part of the important memory model used in Rust

317
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,600
to keep things safe.

318
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,280
And if you called that Rust, that

319
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,500
wouldn't really be Rust.

320
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,080
It's an interesting question because it

321
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,000
is sort of it's not necessarily violating those freedoms.

322
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,880
It's still entirely open source.

323
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,760
It's a trademark issue, kind of if you

324
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,680
remember the whole Ice Weasel Firefox business.

325
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,000
It's definitely similar to that.

326
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,120
But of course, the code is all still open source.

327
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,520
Steve Klabnik, who's a Rust developer,

328
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,320
did respond over at Hacker News and said, basically, yes,

329
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,400
the intention of the policy is to prevent people

330
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,480
from adding confusion around a fork of the language.

331
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,840
But we do know that distributions

332
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,760
make patches to Rust and still call it Rust.

333
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,560
And we're fine with that.

334
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,600
Nobody's asked to do it.

335
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,000
And we haven't instigated any problems with that.

336
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,680
So I think it is kind of a gray area.

337
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,080
It's not maybe as free as we would like to see.

338
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,680
But there are trade-offs to be made.

339
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,120
And I think the Rust team has done

340
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,560
a good job of managing their project

341
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,160
and has gained a lot of contributions,

342
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,400
even made a whole subsegment on this show for it.

343
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,640
So I don't know that it's the end of the world just yet.

344
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,520
Yeah.

345
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,040
Yeah, it seems like they'll work it out.

346
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,480
But it was interesting to see people go

347
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,800
to their edges of the mat and say, well, distributions

348
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,480
do this.

349
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,080
And then other people say, well, the four essential freedoms

350
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,720
guarantee us this.

351
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,760
But we'll sort it out and do it, of course.

352
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,040
And in the meantime, we'll keep an eye as part of Rust Watch.

353
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:11,160
Where did you find this guy?

354
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,040
Yeah, he's real cheesy.

355
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,920
If you hadn't brought the tacos, I don't know, Wes.

356
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,920
I just don't know.

357
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,400
Tacos smooth all wounds.

358
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,280
Well, something pretty neat happened this last week.

359
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,760
It really happened over the weekend.

360
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,200
The folks over at Elementary OS launched App Center

361
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,640
for Everyone on IndieGoGo, a fundraiser

362
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,320
to get the team together in Denver

363
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,560
to work essentially on a sprint.

364
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,160
And their goal was $10,000.

365
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,520
That was probably too low.

366
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,160
Because as we record this, they have reached 110%

367
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:42,880
of their funding.

368
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,600
They're now at $11,000.

369
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,280
Wow.

370
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,760
Congratulations, Dan and Cassidy.

371
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,240
Thanks.

372
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:47,960
Thank you.

373
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,440
So this is obviously a signal that your user base

374
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,440
gets what you're doing and encourages you to keep going.

375
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,680
Did you shoot a little too low, possibly?

376
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,400
Well, I think what we wanted to set up

377
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,320
is what the cost of the sprint was.

378
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,040
And we budgeted out pretty carefully

379
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,760
of what is actually it going to cost us to build this thing.

380
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,320
But yeah, I guess it might have been

381
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,360
that we could have shot for two weeks or two separate sprints.

382
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,240
We're talking now about how we could handle some stretch

383
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,120
goals.

384
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,640
And the kind of ideas are either following up

385
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,720
with another sprint, maybe that or something,

386
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,360
or as we originally planned with the campaign,

387
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,320
to use any extra funds to do remote contracted work.

388
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,200
Sure.

389
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,320
So Cassidy, I've noticed that you've been hustling like crazy,

390
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,160
trying to reach out to everybody who's

391
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,840
kicked in, contacting people to spread the word.

392
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,720
Has this been a full-time job for you for the last few days?

393
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,880
Kind of, yeah.

394
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,720
It's been a lot.

395
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,760
But it's been really fun.

396
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,360
I mean, Dan did most of the campaign setup

397
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,960
or a lot of the campaign setup work, recorded a video.

398
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,520
I helped edit that a little bit.

399
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,140
And we've been sending out the updates.

400
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,520
But we've heard from backers that they

401
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,360
like getting updates from the project,

402
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,600
even if they've already backed.

403
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,900
Like, we're not begging them for more money or anything.

404
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,280
But they like hearing, like, yeah, hey,

405
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,320
we hit this percentage.

406
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,880
We hit this number of backers.

407
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,520
Oh, hey, here's an update on the swag.

408
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,560
So I've been trying to be really transparent with that.

409
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,720
That's been really great.

410
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,440
So let's explain, before we go too far, what it

411
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,240
is that the goal is here, Dan.

412
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,760
It's App Center for Everyone.

413
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,200
What does that really mean?

414
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,760
The end result is a sprint that will hopefully produce what?

415
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,040
The idea is that when we first did App Center,

416
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,480
we did our fundraiser a couple of years ago.

417
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,040
And it was the pay-what-you-want app store for elementary OS.

418
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,520
As we've been working on it, technologies like Flatpak

419
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,660
have kind of evolved.

420
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:54,760
And we see developers that are looking at that

421
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,240
and saying, hey, I would really like to reach more users

422
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,800
than just elementary OS users.

423
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,940
But when I publish on Flat Hub, I

424
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,800
lose all the cool pay-what-you-want stuff

425
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,520
that comes with App Center.

426
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,720
We want to embrace Flatpak and make

427
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,360
that the standard in App Center so the developer will publish

428
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,480
in App Center, still use our pay-what-you-want model,

429
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,400
but also get a little bit of that wider spread

430
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,600
from Flatpak.

431
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,500
And there's a lot of cool privacy.

432
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,480
It's security implications and stability

433
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,680
and all kinds of stuff for users on that side of using Flatpak.

434
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,800
So that's kind of the big idea is we're taking everything

435
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,640
and rebuilding it from the ground up

436
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,200
around modern technology and all the cool stuff that

437
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,120
comes with it.

438
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,800
As if you were going to build it today, essentially.

439
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,760
How much is this related to some of the work

440
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,920
that Endless has been doing to create ways

441
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,400
to pay for Flatpaks?

442
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,840
So this is actually hand-in-hand with that work.

443
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,480
We've been in discussion with folks

444
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,560
at Endless and FlatHub and Flatpak itself.

445
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,240
And they've been really good about getting feedback

446
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,080
from elementary because they know,

447
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,320
we have a successful pay-what-you-want app store,

448
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,440
and they want to build that capability into Flatpak

449
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,560
itself.

450
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,080
So the new Flatpak Authenticators

451
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,200
is a technology that's enabling that,

452
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,640
and it's looking really good.

453
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,840
And so the end product would be a technology, a set of APIs

454
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,760
or a set of libraries or what, that developers

455
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,440
that are targeting any distribution

456
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,240
could use to enable payments for the Flatpak on, say, Fedora,

457
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,000
for example.

458
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,760
Correct?

459
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,960
The Flatpak Authenticator is part of,

460
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,300
it's associated with the Flatpak remote.

461
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,680
So we'd have an app center remote,

462
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,880
just like you have a FlatHub remote today.

463
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,960
And then when you add that remote to your system,

464
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,800
it automatically downloads the Authenticator

465
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,640
that goes along with that remote.

466
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,560
So then when you go to install a Flatpak from that remote,

467
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,680
it's up to the Authenticator, which is some sort of,

468
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,400
it can be like a website, or in our case,

469
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,200
it's a native GTK app.

470
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,780
So that'll come up and offer the pay what you want download.

471
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,440
So basically, if you target app center

472
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,600
and you put your app in the app center repo,

473
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,680
then you get those pay what you want payments on any Flatpak

474
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,600
platform.

475
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,360
I see.

476
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,680
So we're not necessarily talking about the app center software,

477
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,160
the store itself, coming to all distributions as a Flatpak,

478
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:19,320
but more of the availability to use this new functionality.

479
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,980
Yeah, that's the beauty of it is that you get to still use

480
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,440
GNOME software or KDD Discover or whatever

481
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,220
it is that you use to consume Flatpaks on your system,

482
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,960
even if it's like the command line,

483
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,520
it still throws the Authenticator

484
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,280
when you go to download.

485
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,520
So you can still use whatever your native system is

486
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,200
that you like.

487
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,240
You don't have to use the app center app,

488
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,520
but you still get to enjoy those apps,

489
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,120
and developers still have a way to monetize.

490
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,720
And we're building the back end in such a way

491
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,400
that it should be agnostic, and it

492
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,440
should be easy to stand up your own instance of it

493
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,400
so that FlatHub can take advantage of this as well.

494
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,200
And we want to really like where anybody can spin up

495
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,880
an app center or FlatHub instance,

496
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,680
their own pay what you want app stores.

497
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,120
Wow, that could be really neat.

498
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,040
So who sits in the middle of refunds?

499
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,660
So say somebody buys something via this process that

500
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,000
isn't an elementary OS app center user

501
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,880
and decides, ah, I don't like this.

502
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,240
I want a refund.

503
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,620
Is your project involved at all in that process,

504
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,200
or is that handled separately?

505
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,040
So the way it's currently set up is that apps are actually

506
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:33,200
sold by the app authors themselves.

507
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,520
So it's a more direct relationship.

508
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,160
While we are kind of an in-between that

509
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,480
helps distribute those applications,

510
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,680
the application is being sold by the app developer.

511
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,200
So now users will get an email with information

512
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:47,960
about the purchase.

513
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,680
And then they can, if they want, they

514
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,040
can request a refund that way.

515
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,000
And that'll actually go through the app developer.

516
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,400
Oh, interesting.

517
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,920
Nice and scalable, it sounds like.

518
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,240
So that's, yeah, so then it's just part of the support

519
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,480
process that developer would normally take on anyway,

520
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,320
and doesn't involve the project at all.

521
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,920
I think that was like one of the questions I thought, hmm,

522
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,200
I see people asking this, and I don't

523
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,000
know what the answer is to that.

524
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,080
That seems very elegant and how it already

525
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,080
operates in the app center today.

526
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,840
Exactly, and that's one of the awesome things

527
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,320
that Stripe gives us for free as part of their payments API

528
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,880
is they enable a direct relationship

529
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,880
between the developer and the users.

530
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,680
So it's really convenient.

531
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,920
Cheesy, you had a question as well.

532
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,200
So when you talk about streamlining this payment

533
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,800
process, are you also talking about giving me

534
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,600
the ability to set up an account that I can then

535
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,560
tie to a credit card that will remember

536
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,120
my purchases throughout the app center experience?

537
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,280
That's the big thing that we're looking at is, well, firstly,

538
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,840
we want to have something that's just

539
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,920
you being able to save the payment

540
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,400
and do like a one-click payment.

541
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,560
But the ultimate goal is that we would

542
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,080
like to have some kind of way for you

543
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,320
to log in on another computer and restore

544
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,880
your purchases over there.

545
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,920
And we want to just make sure that we

546
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,320
do that in a way that's secure and privacy respecting,

547
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,720
and we don't want to hold onto a bunch of private data.

548
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,520
So we're kind of working through different models of what

549
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,440
can be stored through Stripe's API,

550
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,680
and we can use tokens and their kind of proven security

551
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,840
infrastructure, and what works better

552
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,600
as local data stored on your computer,

553
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,640
and try to keep as much information off

554
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,520
of elementary servers as possible.

555
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,840
Yeah, I would agree with that.

556
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,880
Who wants that hassle?

557
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,800
Good.

558
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,120
I think that answers Colonel's question, too, that he had.

559
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,120
Yeah, it's clear that there's been a lot of thought

560
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,680
put into the design here.

561
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,400
It feels like the project is transitioning

562
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,400
to the next level of involvement with the wider community.

563
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,880
Because I think also, Cassidy, of your recent work

564
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,360
with the free desktop standard around dark theming,

565
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,360
and going to these events, and speaking there,

566
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,320
and having a presence, and being part of the conversation

567
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,680
around those things, as well as something like this,

568
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:08,480
working with Endless, and putting something actually

569
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,880
usable around Flatpak for payments.

570
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,040
It's going to have wider implications than just what

571
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,800
happens on elementary OS, but should also, hopefully,

572
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,440
improve the app ecosystem on elementary OS, as well.

573
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,240
So I think it's a very clever strategy, gentlemen.

574
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:23,960
Well done.

575
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,440
Thank you.

576
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,360
Yeah, we love that whole coopertition angle.

577
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,040
We can work together, and build things,

578
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,240
and compete a little bit.

579
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,440
But we're all building free software,

580
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,760
so let's just work together.

581
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,480
And the rest of us get to benefit.

582
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,680
I think, too, it's worth mentioning how important

583
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,520
I personally believe it is to have

584
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,600
a way to pay for decent third-party applications.

585
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:53,120
When I tried out the Mac with the eGPU a couple of weeks

586
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:59,560
ago, and loaded some application to manage Final Cut libraries,

587
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,400
just to several apps that are also available for iOS,

588
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,520
so I installed them on the Mac to match my iPhone.

589
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,960
And the quality of the applications,

590
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:14,600
while you pay $4, $5, $6 to $15 for them, is really strong.

591
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,600
It benefits from the platform having a clear direction

592
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,040
for developers to build applications,

593
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,360
publish them in a central repository,

594
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,480
and charge a fee so that way they can justify

595
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,640
the time spent on them.

596
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,760
Got the support they need to make it sustainable.

597
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,200
And they've managed to make it work

598
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,360
with their crazy, restrictive, overly controlled app center

599
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,200
model.

600
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,240
And this is something that's more universal,

601
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,760
that could be cross-distribution,

602
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,040
but still give us some of those core benefits.

603
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,160
It's a way to do it better than the way Apple does it,

604
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,240
but still reap some of those benefits

605
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,000
of giving developers the ability to feed themselves.

606
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,200
And I mean, since the days of Linux Action Show early,

607
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,760
I have been trying to harp on this point.

608
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,680
I've given up.

609
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,800
I really have.

610
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:03,480
You know, when Ubuntu's App Store didn't really work out,

611
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,040
and I just kind of gave up.

612
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,360
I just thought, all right, this isn't the path to monetization.

613
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,120
But then when I visited the Mac recently,

614
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,600
and you can see the collective benefits now

615
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,040
of many years of having these APIs,

616
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,120
and having these standards, and having these tools,

617
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,080
much like elementary OS does, actually,

618
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,880
having these things in place many years down the road

619
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,280
really does have its benefits.

620
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,760
And you guys are laying down some

621
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,920
of the most essential frameworks right now.

622
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,000
So I'm really pleased to see it got funded.

623
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,080
And I think it should probably be at $15,000, $20,000.

624
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,960
So I say everybody go fund it.

625
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,560
Well, I did.

626
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,560
We'll have a link in the show notes, of course.

627
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,000
Yep, indiegogo.com slash project slash appcenter dash

628
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,600
forward dash everyone.

629
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,200
Go there.

630
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,800
Let's get them going, because isn't this

631
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,040
exactly how we want to see other distributions operating, too?

632
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,800
And the thing that's pretty great about this

633
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,400
is it's a direct lever.

634
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,160
The users and the community are funding this.

635
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,960
They, as a team, are getting together and producing code.

636
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,160
It's a pretty great opportunity to be directly involved

637
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,160
with the development.

638
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,640
And I would argue an opportunity you

639
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,320
don't get with commercial software development

640
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,640
ever, other than going and buying their products directly,

641
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,320
which is a very detached way.

642
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,120
You're directly helping developers.

643
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,480
It's pretty special.

644
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,920
So good luck.

645
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,840
I will give it a ding for that one.

646
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,160
And great work, gentlemen.

647
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:20,920
Great work.

648
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,840
Thank you.

649
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,360
Thank you.

650
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,880
Glad to see it proceeding.

651
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,800
I think you launched it on a Friday, right?

652
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,880
Who does that?

653
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,480
Who launches it?

654
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,160
Or was it Thursday?

655
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:29,840
I can't remember.

656
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,040
Yeah, it was Friday morning.

657
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,120
It was kind of a weird time.

658
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,600
And it blew up over the weekend.

659
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,600
That's never going to work.

660
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,800
Yeah, well, by like Monday, midday, Monday,

661
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,560
you guys had already hit your goal, right?

662
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,080
Yeah.

663
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,240
Yeah, Monday afternoon.

664
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,480
I really think you really played the game of getting out there,

665
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,920
getting the word out there, casting the net as far

666
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,840
as possible, thanking people, being part of the community

667
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,760
while it was happening.

668
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,600
And I think it paid off.

669
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,640
And I'd love to hear how it goes.

670
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,240
I would love to be able to go.

671
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,440
Don't think it's going to be possible.

672
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,200
But I was putting feelers out there.

673
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,200
But if nothing else, love to have one of you guys join us

674
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,200
or both of you join us again to just kind of give us

675
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,840
an update afterwards to let everybody know how it went.

676
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,440
I think that'd be really cool if you could make it work.

677
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,240
We'll do, yeah.

678
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:11,880
Thank you, guys.

679
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,080
Wonderful.

680
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,960
One note before we get to Fosdom.

681
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,480
And I don't know if we're going to keep doing this anymore.

682
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,360
It's sort of gotten a life of its own.

683
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,120
And it's this burnout topic we've talked about.

684
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,440
And you'll recall this really kind of came up,

685
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:29,280
I want to say, almost a month ago on the show when, well,

686
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,880
it really kind of came up when a PPA maintainer got really

687
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,720
frustrated by demands that were being put on him

688
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,280
and pulled his PPAs, which included ZFS on Linux

689
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:43,360
for Ubuntu and a bunch of other really critical packages.

690
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,760
And that's when the burnout conversation came up.

691
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,280
And we found this clip from Fosdom,

692
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,560
which I think we'll just play now, because it almost

693
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,800
perfectly summarizes the issue that that developer was

694
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,400
going through, as well as, what was the blog we read, Wes,

695
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:56,960
that was super cool?

696
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,000
Oh, yeah, Drew DeVault's post about just

697
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,440
how hard and beautiful it is to work in FOS software.

698
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,080
That was a good post and really got us thinking about this.

699
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,720
And you found a clip from Fosdom.

700
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,360
It does have a bit of audio noise.

701
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,760
I think it's just on a wireless mic,

702
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,160
but it's totally understandable.

703
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,840
All projects go through, or successful projects,

704
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,680
go through a sort of, please, please contribute

705
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,400
to my project, please like me, to a, oh, my god,

706
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,360
what do I do with everybody liking me so much?

707
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,880
This is a scaling problem in open source.

708
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,000
And in Linux, the crisis point was actually reached in 2002,

709
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,840
which is pretty good.

710
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:35,480
This is 11 years after the initial project started.

711
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,200
Up till 2002, every patch that went into Linux,

712
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,760
and I believe you've seen Greg Crow Hartman's statistics

713
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,680
telling you today about how many tens to,

714
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,800
we're approaching hundreds of thousands of patches

715
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,120
emerged by each release cycle, every patch

716
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,720
was emailed personally to Linus and personally integrated

717
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,440
by him.

718
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,800
This gives you an idea, given the patch volume

719
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,480
we accept today, of why this model just wouldn't scale.

720
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,040
And like I said, the scaling point was reached in 2002.

721
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,960
Linus just was starting to burn out and couldn't cope.

722
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,120
But we talked about it a lot in terms

723
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,800
of software development, open source sustainability.

724
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,880
But one of the things I've heard from the audience

725
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,040
is it hits them at work as a system administrator,

726
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,920
or in sales, or Tim hit me up on Telegram

727
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,600
and said that he's just been fighting at home,

728
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,560
working at home, being burned out

729
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,760
by all of the things that are at home that are not work,

730
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,360
like the dishes or the laundry.

731
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,840
Everything else you're behind on.

732
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,800
Yeah, everything else.

733
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,160
And he finds it distracting, which is pretty cool,

734
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,400
because Brent, you chimed in.

735
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,680
You were in the conversation, and you

736
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,200
chimed in with a couple of suggestions

737
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,960
that you follow when you're working from home

738
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,120
and kind of feeling that way.

739
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,440
Support is a huge one.

740
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,320
Feeling like you're connected to other people

741
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,360
and sharing ideas is massive.

742
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,560
I think you'd mentioned in there going for a walk too.

743
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,200
And Alex suggested sometimes even just getting up

744
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,720
and switching locations.

745
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,600
Yeah, going for a walk changes up your ideas.

746
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,040
Like, you've done this, Chris.

747
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,560
Just go for a 10, 20 minute walk,

748
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:58,200
and it's amazing how that resets your mindset.

749
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,560
And also switching locations.

750
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,840
I try to only do work in that specific chair

751
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,440
in that corner of that room so that when I'm not there,

752
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,520
I'm not thinking of work.

753
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,800
But the opposite's also true.

754
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,320
When I'm sitting there, all I'm doing is work.

755
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,880
I'm trying not to do other stuff.

756
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,760
That's interesting.

757
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,560
Tim said that one of the things that he did

758
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,160
was he set a little bit of time aside

759
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,160
to just focus on cleaning his workbench first

760
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,760
and took it away from watching YouTube time,

761
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,600
which I thought.

762
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,440
Oh, that's nice.

763
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,040
We could probably all make a few cuts here or there.

764
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,720
Or even if you just set yourself,

765
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,080
okay, I'm gonna spend X amount of time every day

766
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,760
working on this thing that's driving me crazy.

767
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,080
Then when you are trying to focus on your work

768
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,760
and it starts to creep into your mind,

769
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,360
you can remind yourself, don't worry,

770
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,960
you've set time, you've dedicated time to deal with that.

771
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,080
It can help you stay focused

772
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,400
and gives you a little more energy too once you get it done.

773
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,280
My experiment, I talked about it last week,

774
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,960
was I launched The Chris Last Cast.

775
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,960
And that was really interesting

776
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,920
because it was a chance for me

777
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,960
to try totally different equipment,

778
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,080
totally different recording styles.

779
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:01,080
And I even did one episode that I honestly was scared.

780
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,600
I thought about pulling a couple of times,

781
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,520
which I haven't pushed myself in that way

782
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,400
in a really long time.

783
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:11,520
So that felt kind of like I was starting,

784
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,920
it felt new again.

785
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,760
It felt really new.

786
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,080
That was, I feel like that kind of energize

787
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,040
I got from taking a risk and then having it work out.

788
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,080
I have carried that momentum into the shows this week.

789
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,560
Here, it's been a really interesting kind of-

790
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,040
Even though it was, I mean, more work that you had to do

791
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,400
and a lot of investment,

792
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,800
I can still end up having benefits and dividends

793
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,840
way ahead of proportion.

794
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,800
But kind of like Tim, I just watched less YouTube.

795
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,640
That's really what I did.

796
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,480
Well, there you go.

797
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,440
And I launched a long-term project

798
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,040
called Work Life and RV at worklifeandrv.com.

799
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,640
And I launched a blog as well

800
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,880
that my wife and I did together.

801
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,360
And we blogged about our solar upgrade.

802
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,120
We've got pictures in there and our junkyard home base,

803
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:56,960
we did a blog-

804
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,800
Oh, it's really lovely.

805
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,280
I'm curious, what'd you use for your blog?

806
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,120
Oh, don't worry.

807
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:00,960
I'm gonna do an episode on it.

808
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,400
Okay, okay.

809
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,920
Yeah, that's definitely something self-hosted

810
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,160
that we're gonna be talking about,

811
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,120
which actually talked a little bit about

812
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,600
some of the hosting in, I think, self-hosted,

813
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,080
I wanna say 11, so you can catch that.

814
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,920
I don't know, I've had a lot of fun.

815
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,960
It was like, it was a total lark.

816
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,880
Like, I'll just try this.

817
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,360
And it went really well.

818
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,840
So I'm gonna stick with some of it.

819
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,720
Probably won't do it with very many Chris Lastcasts.

820
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,200
I'll probably keep it going a little bit though.

821
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,280
But the Work Life and RV thing really got a good reception.

822
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,120
And I've got a lot to say there.

823
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,280
And it just totally doesn't fit on the JB network.

824
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,640
Right, a little extra space on the side

825
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,800
so you don't have to compromise

826
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,080
on how you talk about it or cover it.

827
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,040
You can really dive in.

828
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,320
Yeah, and that's obviously something

829
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,160
I've got a lot of experience.

830
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,840
I've been doing it for five years.

831
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,360
You only talk about it all the time.

832
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,120
Yeah, off air, it's like pretty much all I talk about.

833
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,360
So it gives me an outlet that doesn't sort of,

834
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,200
you know, wreck the on-air content at JP.

835
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,520
But be honest about it.

836
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,360
It was just a really,

837
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,520
it was a really interesting experience.

838
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,160
It was a challenge that I put out there last week,

839
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,840
and I'm really glad that we did it.

840
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,840
And I got a few positive things.

841
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,200
I'd love to hear other people's results

842
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,440
at linuxunplug.com slash contact.

843
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,040
Your last episode of Chris Lastcast,

844
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,720
the one you did with Jason Spizak.

845
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,520
Man, that was a good episode.

846
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,800
I really loved it.

847
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,000
I ended up just sitting down and listening to it,

848
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,200
just me and the podcast for like an hour.

849
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,320
It was, it was great.

850
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,680
So please, hopefully you're getting some good,

851
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,040
good feedback and I'd love to hear more of that.

852
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,880
Well, thank you.

853
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,240
That was the one that I was the most nervous about

854
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,720
because I went out there with the title.

855
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,320
You know, I also was,

856
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,280
I gave me a chance to practice listening better

857
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,520
and not speaking as much.

858
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,040
And so I, at times I just put my hand over my mouth,

859
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,600
I would just listen and give,

860
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,240
give him the space to finish his thought,

861
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,440
which is something that I don't do as often

862
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,280
on the live shows because we are live

863
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,280
and we are sticking to a time limit and we move on.

864
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,320
Right, you have to manage the flow.

865
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,080
Yeah, and so it was a chance for me to practice a skill

866
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,480
that isn't my primary skill when I'm hosting,

867
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,520
but one that I need to develop further.

868
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,640
And Jason's great.

869
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,440
You know, he's got a, he's got a great audio setup.

870
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,480
He's got two different professional audio studios.

871
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,320
He runs them all on Linux.

872
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,160
Incredible.

873
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,480
And the man can talk about anything.

874
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,000
So, and he's, I think he's a, he's a wise man too.

875
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,320
So thank you, Brent.

876
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,360
I don't know if I would have done it

877
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,720
if this burnout topic hadn't come up,

878
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,480
but I felt like I needed to kind of get

879
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,280
the energy level up a little bit,

880
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,080
but I needed to do things out of the box

881
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,120
that would scare me and challenge me a little bit.

882
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,640
Right, get out of the, get out of the grind, feel refreshed.

883
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:29,040
Yeah, and, and then I, then I feel more focused than ever.

884
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,800
It's been an interesting process.

885
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,640
Been a good challenge.

886
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,640
It was, I'm glad we did it.

887
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,040
I almost want to, I almost want to keep it going,

888
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,000
but I think now I'm just going to try to find a balance,

889
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,520
which I think is what we all, we all have to do.

890
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,560
Few quick housekeeping items.

891
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,400
I don't have a bunch in here

892
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,640
other than to go say check out Brunch with Brent

893
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,040
with Peter Adams, if you haven't yet.

894
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,080
Part one and two are both posted.

895
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,040
He's the photographer behind the faces of open source,

896
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,000
a great thinker himself,

897
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,120
and that was also a great conversation.

898
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,440
And our telegram group.

899
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,160
Now I think over, is it over 1500 now, Sol?

900
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,000
Did we stay there?

901
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,840
Yes, I think so.

902
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,160
We were bouncing around all weekend.

903
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,760
No, we're at 1499.

904
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,840
Oh, oh, come on.

905
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,240
One, one away.

906
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,920
Here's my commitment.

907
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,040
If we can get all, if we can cross 1500

908
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,440
and get all of you in one space,

909
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,160
I will buy PBRs for everyone.

910
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,600
It's like 1500 bucks, dude, I mean.

911
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,040
I know, but dude, how, but come on.

912
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,080
We're never going to get everybody together.

913
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,840
But I do feel like we should get

914
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,360
like a telegram hangout going.

915
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,960
That would be really great.

916
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,760
Like a meetup every now and then.

917
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,400
Something, there's something there,

918
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,600
something there that we got to look into.

919
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,480
So that's at Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash telegram.

920
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,120
Conversation keep going after the here show.

921
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,400
So you can go check that out.

922
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,200
And that's really, I think all the housekeeping I got.

923
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,040
I think that's it, Wes.

924
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,360
You got anything else?

925
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,120
That looks pretty clean around here.

926
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:46,960
The bell has rung.

927
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,640
Yeah, well, that's what happens, you know,

928
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,280
when we clean up after ourselves.

929
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,040
So FOSDEM 2020.

930
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,920
FOSDEM was started in 2000.

931
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,120
It was a different name back then,

932
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,800
but essentially the same thing.

933
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,160
And entrance and participation is entirely free.

934
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,000
It's financed by sponsors who accept

935
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,520
the non-commercial nature of the event.

936
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,600
And there's donors amongst the visitors.

937
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,440
You can donate,

938
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,840
which a lot of people in our audience have.

939
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,680
Absolutely.

940
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,760
Donors receive a form and a token

941
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,040
that gives them like, you know, an extra little note.

942
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,280
Ooh.

943
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,120
Little, I don't know, what do you call that?

944
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:18,960
Flare?

945
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,880
Yeah, Flare.

946
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:23,840
And so it's like a four, 5,000 plus event.

947
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,720
Carl, you were there?

948
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,560
Yes, sir.

949
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,960
Did you get a rough figure of the numbers?

950
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,200
It's a little weird because the thing is spread

951
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,000
across a lot of different buildings on that college campus.

952
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,280
So every building's jam packed,

953
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,640
but you never get a sense of all of the people

954
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,080
all at one time.

955
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:39,920
Yeah, okay.

956
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,640
That would be hard to measure, you're right.

957
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,640
Carl, I'd like to get your take on FOSDEM

958
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,400
compared to events here in the States.

959
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,640
It was definitely very different.

960
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,760
It was the first FOSDEM I'd been to.

961
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,720
I've always heard about it.

962
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,080
The biggest thing that struck me

963
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,560
other than the number of people there

964
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,840
was that it was a lot different projects

965
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,920
that showed up there.

966
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,800
I've never seen Gnome at a Stateside conference,

967
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,640
for instance.

968
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,080
So I managed to get me a lot of Gnome stickers.

969
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,240
I got an F-Droid sticker.

970
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,240
I'd never seen them in a conference before.

971
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,640
A lot of projects like that, that for whatever reason,

972
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,560
have a lot more European contributors

973
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,240
and they're regulars there at FOSDEM,

974
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,600
but they don't come Stateside for whatever reason.

975
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,440
That makes sense.

976
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,680
I mean, I don't make it over there very often.

977
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,520
Indeed.

978
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,360
Which is a real shame.

979
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,840
So, I mean, I've always wanted to.

980
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,560
So I'm glad you're able to make it, Carl.

981
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,400
That's pretty great.

982
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,400
Would you go again?

983
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,520
Probably won't have a choice with my new job.

984
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,360
CentOS, I'm working on CentOS now for Red Hat.

985
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,960
And so they're probably going to have me go back there again.

986
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,560
Next year, I'd like to actually make it to a few more talks.

987
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,080
This year, I did spend most of my time at the CentOS booth

988
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,320
and meeting a lot of my new teammates.

989
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,440
I went to a couple of talks in the distribution dev room.

990
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,200
And what I realized was that I went in the morning,

991
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,920
but once you leave, you can't really get back in

992
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,280
because there's just a waiting,

993
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,680
a line of people waiting to get back in.

994
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,440
And so if you want to, if you have a dev room

995
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,040
that you want to see the talks at for the day,

996
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,960
get there early and just camp out there the entire day.

997
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,400
Like don't even drink water

998
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,920
because you'll have to get up to go to the bathroom.

999
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,480
Oh, Ace Nomad, there was a bit of a JB mini meetup

1000
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,480
at FOSDEM, eh?

1001
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,320
Yeah, there is.

1002
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,480
I saw ByteBitten for the first time

1003
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,200
as well as Bitten throughout the conference.

1004
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,160
And I knew there was a few other

1005
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,480
JB community members there as well.

1006
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,280
I actually got to meet Carl at the very, very tail end

1007
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,880
of the last part of the day for a couple of minutes.

1008
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,280
So yeah, it was great.

1009
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,120
That's neat.

1010
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:33,960
Fantastic.

1011
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,320
FOSDEM pumps out videos

1012
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,600
like no other conference pumps out videos.

1013
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,560
Very impressive.

1014
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,040
It might be like 800 videos for this event so far.

1015
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,160
And the turnaround between like when the conference happened

1016
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,040
and the videos being up, wow.

1017
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,720
Now we went through as many of these as we could

1018
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,320
and pulled out a few gems

1019
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,600
because there's some great stuff in there

1020
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,960
and nobody can go to everything

1021
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,960
and nobody could go through all of those clips

1022
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,080
but we gave it a good shot.

1023
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,800
And something about me recently

1024
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,160
has really been enjoying the history aspect

1025
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,240
of Unix and Linux.

1026
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,920
And guess what?

1027
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,360
I found a talk that talks about

1028
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,600
some of the very early linkages in Unix history.

1029
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,960
They were absolutely fundamental to get where we are today

1030
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,360
that we never talk about.

1031
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,080
And one of them was almost completely lost to time.

1032
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:24,320
And it's called the PDP-7

1033
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,360
and it's a huge machine.

1034
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,360
But what's a PDP-7?

1035
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,640
It's a mini computer

1036
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:35,440
that Digital Equipment Corporation, DEC, produced

1037
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,800
in the 60s and 70s.

1038
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,600
And it was one of a line of 18-bit computers.

1039
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,200
Now 18-bit sounds kind of weird.

1040
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,400
We're used to 16 or 32 or 64 bits.

1041
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,960
But at the time DEC came out with this,

1042
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,000
all the mainframes were 36 bits.

1043
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,880
So 18 made sense.

1044
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,520
It was like half a mainframe or something

1045
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,680
kind of in the thinking of the time.

1046
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,280
An 18-bit computer.

1047
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,600
Mini computer.

1048
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,480
And we wouldn't likely have the Berkeley BSDs

1049
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,160
if it wasn't for this rig.

1050
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,800
And it was lost to history

1051
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,600
because simply records were lost

1052
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,520
and documentation on these punch cards was lost.

1053
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,920
PDP-7 Unix is largely a footnote in history.

1054
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,360
Nobody uses it today, nobody knows about it today

1055
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:21,960
except maybe a quick question to a trivia,

1056
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,520
or an answer to a trivia question.

1057
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,720
But it was very important in building credibility

1058
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,480
for this group at Bell Labs.

1059
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:34,000
They had just spent five years with a failure in Multics

1060
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,920
and they needed some wind they could show.

1061
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,600
So they were able to use the PDP-7,

1062
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,840
show it to people, show how useful it was,

1063
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:45,000
and were able to get the patent department

1064
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
to buy the PDP-11 to port Unix to.

1065
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,200
For a long time it was believed

1066
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,640
the sources were lost to history.

1067
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,800
There's no binary artifacts from this time.

1068
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,160
Nothing really survived.

1069
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,440
But there have been a few recent discoveries.

1070
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:04,480
One of them was in the home of a man named Robert Morris.

1071
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,040
It's probably a name you're not familiar with.

1072
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,640
But he invented something you likely use every single day.

1073
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,840
In 2011, Robert Morris Sr. passed away.

1074
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:17,040
Now he was a security researcher at Bell Labs

1075
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,200
in the 60s, 70s, and 80s.

1076
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,720
And he did a lot of security things on Unix.

1077
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,600
Probably the one you're most familiar with is Etsy Password.

1078
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,640
And when he passed away he had a huge collection of papers

1079
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,200
that took a long time to go through.

1080
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,920
So his estate asked Doug McGilroy,

1081
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,640
who was another person from Bell Labs,

1082
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,480
to go through the papers

1083
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,040
and sort out the ones of historical relevance.

1084
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,840
And in here they find old Unix manuals,

1085
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,840
maybe even what might be source code

1086
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,400
that is literally printed out.

1087
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,280
But they don't go much further with it

1088
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,600
until about a year later.

1089
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,360
The next year, in 2016,

1090
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,040
Norm Wilson was going through his garage

1091
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,520
and found this notebook of Unix source

1092
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,560
that he had copied while he worked at Bell Labs.

1093
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:08,560
And it turns out that it was the PDP-7 kernel listing

1094
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,760
and the user utilities A through F.

1095
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:17,200
So a group with a twos group typed this all in

1096
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,280
because you might think this would work to OCR,

1097
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,560
but when you OCR it and you get all kinds of errors

1098
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,760
and you have to recheck it anyway,

1099
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,200
so it's faster just to type it all in.

1100
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,360
So they typed it all in and created an image

1101
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:32,600
and enhanced SimH simulator to run it.

1102
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:36,520
And now you can run PDP-7 Unix.

1103
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,840
You can run it because they typed in by hand

1104
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,440
the source code that was printed out.

1105
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,840
Glad I didn't have that job.

1106
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,760
I know.

1107
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,600
I know.

1108
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,360
And it was sort of the granddaddy

1109
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,760
to what later became the Unixs that became the BSDs

1110
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,680
that eventually became the BSD wars,

1111
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,160
which led to the revolution

1112
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,360
that was Linux and free software and-

1113
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:00,000
It's an amazingly rich history that we're a part of.

1114
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,400
Before we go from the past, there was one bit in there too,

1115
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,480
we'll link to the full talk,

1116
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,160
but there was one bit in there.

1117
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,400
That you really got to appreciate.

1118
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,800
And that was what a crap show early networking was.

1119
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,160
I mean, you might remember,

1120
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:19,400
if you can recall token ring networks and net buoy and IPX,

1121
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,200
there were so many different kinds of standards

1122
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,320
and ways to communicate.

1123
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,760
But more than that,

1124
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,400
there was fundamental philosophical differences

1125
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:31,240
on how the data should move around a network.

1126
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,480
Networking in Unix also goes back a long way.

1127
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,080
So a lot of people say, oh, it started with Berkeley

1128
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,160
and it turns out that there were a number of implementations

1129
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:42,480
before Berkeley did their stack.

1130
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,120
This is timeline wise, 1977.

1131
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,840
Before Berkeley at AT&T,

1132
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,200
there was something called data kit

1133
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,080
and at Berkeley, there was something called BerkNet.

1134
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:56,880
But BBN wrote the TCP IP stack

1135
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,240
that would actually later go into Berkeley.

1136
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,840
Berkeley added a sockets API,

1137
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,200
the BBN stack had a completely different API

1138
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,800
that was more file oriented

1139
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,400
and showed some of the limitations

1140
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,400
of the everything is a file paradigm.

1141
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,520
Isn't that fascinating?

1142
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,840
That of course was gonna be the Unix's first approach

1143
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,680
to networking.

1144
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,520
Just make it a file.

1145
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,360
Everything's a file.

1146
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,080
But the earliest ones, it's kind of a tie.

1147
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,360
There's something called Network Unix

1148
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:26,560
that the University of Illinois did in 74.

1149
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,480
And there's a spider cell network inside of AT&T.

1150
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,680
And I put both of these up there

1151
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,480
because it shows the split in thinking

1152
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,000
between these two groups.

1153
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,160
Everybody inside of AT&T was circuit switched.

1154
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,080
They're a phone company.

1155
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,040
They make circuit connections.

1156
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,160
So their networking was based on that.

1157
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,800
Everybody outside of AT&T was packet switched.

1158
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,640
Everything's virtual.

1159
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,880
We just send packets.

1160
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,440
And that's the school of thought that won.

1161
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,640
And that also explains why if you go back

1162
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,960
and look at these early Unix's,

1163
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,640
a lot of the ones from Bell Labs

1164
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,960
don't have any TCP IP stack

1165
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,600
because they had this giant blind spot.

1166
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,840
They thought everything was gonna be circuit switched.

1167
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,800
Wow, that's fascinating.

1168
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,800
I mean, it makes perfect sense, but wow.

1169
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,960
I know.

1170
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,680
It could have gone a different way.

1171
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,240
Now, to show you sort of the opposite side of FOSDEM,

1172
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,200
there's also a much more modern side.

1173
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,840
Ironically, right now while we stream,

1174
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,920
there's a conversation in the chat room

1175
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,520
about confusion around IRC.

1176
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,560
And this was one of the points that Matthew,

1177
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,920
I think it's Broberg?

1178
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,320
Yeah, that's a great name, Broberg.

1179
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,400
I love that. Absolutely.

1180
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,840
Matthew is making the point

1181
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:35,720
that none of you that are longtime Linux users

1182
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,040
are going to want to hear.

1183
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,080
And that is the next generation of contributors

1184
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:43,840
does not want to get on IRC.

1185
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,560
But my pathway is not the same

1186
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,720
as I know many others have gone through.

1187
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:53,080
That started with IRC just being a logical, simple thing.

1188
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:55,040
But for me, it's still this.

1189
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,920
Even though I understand where it comes from

1190
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,200
and I understand it had its place in time,

1191
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,880
I feel as if it's not as inviting

1192
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,720
as that incredible GitHub issue

1193
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,720
that didn't shame me or make me feel stupid.

1194
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,120
He's making the case that people

1195
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,280
who get into open source development

1196
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,920
sort of through the GitHub channels

1197
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,560
and Slack and all these other, Riot Chat,

1198
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,920
all these other platforms,

1199
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:20,800
they look at IRC as if it's something of the stone age.

1200
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,520
And he has numbers to back it up.

1201
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,560
To put it in some context,

1202
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,720
I understand when IRC came out

1203
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,320
and became the de facto standard,

1204
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,280
it's because there's a lot of empty space around.

1205
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,320
It was IRC or nothing to communicate.

1206
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,200
I guess telnetting and reading each other's things

1207
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,560
is something that I've read about as well,

1208
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:38,720
but I'll just put that aside.

1209
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,160
I don't know it very well.

1210
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,040
But if we fast forward to today,

1211
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,600
the stats I've been able to find

1212
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,840
is that IRC is hovering around 400,000 active users

1213
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,160
in the last year or so.

1214
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,640
And we look at some of the other

1215
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,040
synchronous communication channels

1216
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,360
that people are talking about.

1217
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,760
We've got Microsoft Teams.

1218
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:58,280
Okay, so 400,000 for IRC.

1219
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,120
This is a network effect.

1220
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,640
Do you have any guesses for Teams?

1221
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,160
Which you know is gonna be smaller than Slack.

1222
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,280
Yeah, it's gonna be smaller than Slack.

1223
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,720
Let's go with a million.

1224
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,400
Just people have to use that for work

1225
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,040
and don't necessarily love it.

1226
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,160
There's 13 million people on that.

1227
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,000
Slack, people love it.

1228
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,560
Open source communities hate it.

1229
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,320
12 million users.

1230
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,800
Riot.Iam, very impressive that they've grown

1231
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,240
to well over 11 million users.

1232
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,440
These numbers are odd because Teams, he says, is bigger,

1233
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,160
which I guess maybe it's possible.

1234
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,280
Microsoft has a reach.

1235
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,000
And Slack doesn't have the built-in market.

1236
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:31,840
Right, it's not just with your subscription.

1237
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,160
I can see it.

1238
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:36,320
But the really surprising one there was Riot Chat.

1239
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,160
That's great news.

1240
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,000
Yeah, it is.

1241
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,360
Google Chat, it's slowly waning in the background,

1242
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,280
but at four million.

1243
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,280
And that's just synchronous communication channels.

1244
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,440
And that's just recently.

1245
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,960
We zoom out even further and think about the ways

1246
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,480
in which we interact with communities

1247
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,960
in the technology space.

1248
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,440
You've got Twitter, which is my default place

1249
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,880
to conversate with community members.

1250
00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:00,200
At 126 million users, Telegram is way more massive

1251
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,000
than I ever realized at 200 million.

1252
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,360
And a lot more open source communities are talking there.

1253
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,800
Discord is humongous.

1254
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,240
Reddit is a complete beast when we think about it.

1255
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,840
Yeah, when you consider some of the online communities,

1256
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,120
it's even more.

1257
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:16,440
So right now we have 271 people in our IRC room.

1258
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:23,000
And we've now crossed the 1,500 line at the Telegram group.

1259
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I really feel like the end is nigh

1260
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,800
for IRC as a primary community communications tool.

1261
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:33,960
Yeah, I mean, does this mean IRC should just dwindle away

1262
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:34,800
and we move on?

1263
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,640
No, I think technology doesn't work like that.

1264
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,720
Even Betamax is actually still around.

1265
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,480
Not very much anymore, but for many years

1266
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,760
after the, quote unquote, Betamax VHS wars, production

1267
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,760
shops still used Betamax.

1268
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:52,560
Just because Sirius XM launches doesn't mean

1269
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,080
there's not FM radio still.

1270
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,560
It'll always be around.

1271
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:58,800
But I think when you're trying to draw in as many contributors

1272
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:03,280
as possible and bring in fresh contributors,

1273
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,400
I think it's something you've got to at least consider

1274
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,480
and think about.

1275
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,360
Yeah, it's not easy to get started with.

1276
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,960
And unless you really start learning it well,

1277
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,440
it doesn't have the features that people

1278
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,000
are used to or expecting, especially

1279
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,560
if you want contributors who are a little less dedicated

1280
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:20,160
and might just be doing this a couple weekends a month.

1281
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,280
Sure, and they want low barrier of entry.

1282
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,640
In his talk, he talks about how the whole Nixerv stuff,

1283
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,840
where it gets you to authenticate, is just too much.

1284
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:30,800
It was way too much.

1285
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,560
I felt like I was fighting the computer immediately

1286
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,560
as soon as I logged on.

1287
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:36,120
Cassidy, it sounds like you guys have some experience with this.

1288
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:38,200
Yeah, we used to do all of our development

1289
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,880
over on IRC for elementary.

1290
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,440
And honestly, one of the best decisions

1291
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:45,600
we've made as a project was moving away from IRC

1292
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,760
to two other mentalities.

1293
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,480
One is using non-real-time platforms better,

1294
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,240
like GitHub issue tracking.

1295
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,600
And then other chat apps are just a way better experience

1296
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,560
for people than IRC.

1297
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,440
And it's way easier.

1298
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,520
It lowers the barrier of entry to new contributors.

1299
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,200
The integration thing can be nice.

1300
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,000
And a lot of different platforms offer this,

1301
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,600
where you can tie it in with existing workflows

1302
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,320
or there's automatic notifications when

1303
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,560
somebody commits something.

1304
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,960
And you can have a conversation based around an issue

1305
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,880
right there in your main chat program.

1306
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,600
Yeah, exactly.

1307
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,320
We have a private Slack for contributors.

1308
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,080
And we call it our virtual private office.

1309
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,640
Because when you're working, you're in the office.

1310
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,280
You're in Slack.

1311
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,600
When you're not working, you close it.

1312
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,560
And you do all your communication right there.

1313
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:28,360
And it's great.

1314
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:29,000
Yeah.

1315
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,640
And it has a lot more support for I'm available.

1316
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,640
I'm in a meeting.

1317
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,440
Are you sure you want to disturb this person?

1318
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,720
Because they're in a different time zone.

1319
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,280
Like, these things matter when you're

1320
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,080
working in an international team.

1321
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,280
But I don't think it's gone.

1322
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,880
I'm not going to stop using IRC.

1323
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,520
But I think it will be relegated to probably

1324
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:47,680
the existing communities.

1325
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,760
I mean, those numbers are devastating.

1326
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,480
400,000.

1327
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,440
I mean, who knows if they're accurate.

1328
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,440
But they're probably in the ballpark.

1329
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,440
I mean, we just saw some news, what,

1330
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,560
that IBM was going with Slack and has 350,000 employees.

1331
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,600
So that's kind of the scale.

1332
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,280
Yeah, really.

1333
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,120
No kidding.

1334
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,400
All right, well, you found a talk

1335
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,160
that seemed to grab your attention called

1336
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,600
the selfish contributor.

1337
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,320
I'm going to take you on a journey

1338
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:09,560
through the deep, dark, motivational secrets,

1339
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,840
the seamy underbelly of open source,

1340
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,240
how people can actually get engineers

1341
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,640
to contribute efficiently to the open source project.

1342
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,600
I'm James Bottomley.

1343
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:22,560
I work for IBM, as you can see from my email address.

1344
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:25,120
I'm actually a very old school open source person.

1345
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,080
So my open source experience actually

1346
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:30,640
goes back to 1982 with looking at the source

1347
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,600
code of what was then BSD.

1348
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:37,720
So that means I've spent almost 40 years in open source.

1349
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:39,760
Yeah, James is also the SCSI maintainer.

1350
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,220
And he really has a long history in working with open source.

1351
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:44,240
In particular, has seen how, well,

1352
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,880
we like to talk about some of the altruistic motives involved

1353
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:47,440
in open source, right?

1354
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,720
You're helping the community.

1355
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,840
You're adding to the betterment of everyone.

1356
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,880
Really, a lot of things, open source is a shared good.

1357
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,480
But we have to acknowledge that a lot of people's actions

1358
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,280
are primarily self-interested, right?

1359
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:00,280
I mean, you're scratching your own itch.

1360
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,920
And he kind of acknowledges that.

1361
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,720
And you need to think about that if you

1362
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,160
want to make these projects work as well as they can.

1363
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:10,360
So the trap is that once you run into the scaling problem,

1364
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,320
the temptation is to flow control.

1365
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,720
I mean, you're all engineers.

1366
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:17,200
Everybody knows that if you've got a congestion problem,

1367
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,440
you flow control it.

1368
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:21,380
So the natural flow control you would think of

1369
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:24,920
is tap the source, push back on the contributors,

1370
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:26,960
try and slow down the contributions,

1371
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,480
make the pipeline flow much more evenly.

1372
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,920
And effectively, the temptation, therefore,

1373
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,440
is to try and push the problem onto the contributors,

1374
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,120
to raise barriers to contribution.

1375
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:36,620
Right.

1376
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:38,960
And that's sometimes what you see with things like IRC.

1377
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,520
Or in the kernel's case, we talked about that scaling

1378
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,320
problem with Linus.

1379
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:46,120
And they solved it at that level, at the maintainer level,

1380
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:49,560
with tooling, in particular, inventing Git and having

1381
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,000
a system with maintainers where you

1382
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,600
could have multiple trees managed and then merged

1383
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,360
together into one.

1384
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,280
And that's all kind of all about respecting

1385
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,800
your users and contributors.

1386
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:03,160
But conditioning contributions on mandatory unrelated actions,

1387
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:06,560
the quid pro quo, makes contributors feel used.

1388
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,760
You know, it feels like the project

1389
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,040
is stealing your free time.

1390
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,240
You're not giving it voluntarily because you

1391
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,520
want to get this patch upstream.

1392
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:14,840
Perhaps your employer has charged

1393
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,320
you to get this patch upstream.

1394
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,520
So you have to satisfy this quid pro quo

1395
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:19,680
to get this to happen.

1396
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,920
And it makes you feel very used and unhappy.

1397
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,960
Scaling problems must be solved in the acceptance layer.

1398
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,760
They must be solved by tooling.

1399
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,800
They must be solved by the maintainers.

1400
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,920
If you push the scaling problem down onto the contributors,

1401
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,680
you're setting your project up for failure eventually.

1402
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,800
I mean, it will chunter on for a long time.

1403
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,480
Perhaps it will be a popular project for a long time.

1404
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,200
But the moment your popularity starts

1405
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,880
to wane, as it did in the kernel a long time ago,

1406
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,000
is the moment that your contributors will

1407
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,640
start to remember all of the wrongs you've done to them

1408
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,240
and start to move off onto the trendier projects.

1409
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:56,280
If you want to keep a committed contributor base,

1410
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:57,600
you need to treat them well.

1411
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,840
Wow, this feels like we've just come full circle

1412
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,280
on a month-long conversation we've

1413
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,640
been having at the metal level on this show.

1414
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,760
That's really great.

1415
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,720
And there's so many more things.

1416
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:10,840
I really liked everything I grabbed.

1417
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,840
This with the server was really feeling

1418
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,200
the load on this last weekend.

1419
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,160
And it probably will be because they're still

1420
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:16,880
adding more videos.

1421
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,360
So people are still coming and checking.

1422
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,040
And not everything's actually like that.

1423
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,720
It's a tall order to get to them all.

1424
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,960
We'll have some of our favorites linked in the show notes.

1425
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,960
And they're definitely worth checking out, especially a

1426
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:28,000
couple there's been a lot of discussion lately around,

1427
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,880
do Linux distros still matter in the age of containers

1428
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,400
and Kubernetes?

1429
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,680
There's some good answers to that.

1430
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,560
Minimac has a follow-up to the IRC topic.

1431
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:37,640
Go ahead.

1432
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:40,120
I think IRC will stay forever.

1433
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,200
It's like ham radio.

1434
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,040
It will never die.

1435
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:44,160
And someday you'll be happy to have it.

1436
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,520
I could see that.

1437
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,760
It's very low bandwidth, number one.

1438
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,080
And the text-based nature of it means

1439
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:53,080
that it's always going to be advantageous for some reason.

1440
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:56,320
And like the conversation was continuing in the chat room,

1441
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,920
there's tools on top of IRC now that give it

1442
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,520
some of that additional image previewing or integration

1443
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,160
or those kinds of things.

1444
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:04,040
Your thoughts, Byte?

1445
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:08,680
Well, you at least need IRC for all those botnets.

1446
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:09,520
I do.

1447
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,920
I would hate to say goodbye to JBot, if nothing else.

1448
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:17,960
Now it's like, oh, yeah, JBot's like the old bot that's

1449
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,240
been around for so long now.

1450
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,480
It's the cute little broken robot that still kind of works.

1451
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,120
Yeah.

1452
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:24,040
It's over there running in the wall right now,

1453
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,440
but it's still grabbing title suggestions, which we are not

1454
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:27,840
getting enough of.

1455
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,320
Chat room.

1456
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,800
I will shut that IRC down.

1457
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,720
For shame.

1458
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,480
Well, Carl, any other kind of closing notes

1459
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,560
or anything else you want to touch on about FOSDEM?

1460
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:41,240
This is your moment to be our reporter on the scene.

1461
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,920
I don't know if there's anything that you felt like maybe

1462
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,560
we're missing in our chat here.

1463
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,960
Did you see the picture that I posted about kind

1464
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,240
of the summary of FOSDEM?

1465
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,520
I don't know if I did.

1466
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,760
If you go to FOSDEM's Wikipedia page,

1467
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:54,480
the main picture on there besides the logo

1468
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,120
is just one of the rooms with a full sign on it.

1469
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:00,360
They are very strict about fire code and things like that

1470
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:04,160
there, and so it's off-putting to a lot of people.

1471
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,680
This was my first one, but after going,

1472
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,040
I heard a lot of people complaining

1473
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,440
about how they couldn't get into any of the talks they wanted

1474
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,440
to.

1475
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,000
I mentioned the dev rooms where you just kind of had

1476
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,480
to camp out all day long, and you wouldn't get your seat back

1477
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,600
if you even went to the bathroom.

1478
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,920
It can be a little off-putting, but I don't really

1479
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,520
know how they would solve that when you have that many people

1480
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,400
interested in going.

1481
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,120
You don't want to just tell them not to come.

1482
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,380
One of their big appeals is that they

1483
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:30,840
don't require any registration.

1484
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:33,080
It's also free, as in money.

1485
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,800
It doesn't cost anything, and they just

1486
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,160
have so much attendance that they

1487
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,120
have a lot of logistical problems around it.

1488
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,080
Yeah.

1489
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:42,800
That is a tricky balance.

1490
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,040
I have tried to get into a talk and been told, nope,

1491
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,920
room's full, and they've had to say it 100 times,

1492
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,200
so they're kind of not very rough with it.

1493
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,400
Yeah, that's the way to put it.

1494
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:52,360
Not patient.

1495
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:53,120
Yeah.

1496
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,080
It definitely is part of what makes it great,

1497
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:59,000
but also part of what makes it not so great.

1498
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,640
Maybe they could think about how to scale that a little better.

1499
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:03,480
Not sure.

1500
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:07,080
Yeah, the Texas Cyber Summit that we went to, I think,

1501
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:10,960
was doing live streams at the event over a Wi-Fi network

1502
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:11,480
or something.

1503
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,080
Do you recall that?

1504
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,520
They had a way to tune into rooms

1505
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:14,680
that you weren't in for a lot of them.

1506
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,440
Oh, yeah, that was pretty convenient.

1507
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,800
And I don't know how much of that made it public,

1508
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,840
but they had a resource for goers

1509
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,520
that wanted to tune into it.

1510
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,840
But you don't go and travel all that way

1511
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,920
to get an audio feed with bad mic audio,

1512
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,200
because I mean, this mic audio, that's

1513
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,520
even after we've cleaned it up.

1514
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,960
We're cleaning it up and fixing their audio,

1515
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:33,960
and it still doesn't sound great.

1516
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,840
It's never quite like being in the room.

1517
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:38,000
It's really, yeah, it really is what it's about.

1518
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,960
Lots of people there, FOSDEM, they just completely

1519
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,400
ignore the sessions, just focus on the hallway track

1520
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,080
and face-to-face time with people,

1521
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:47,000
because FOSDEM's so good about their video recordings.

1522
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,560
That's what it is, man.

1523
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:49,560
It really is.

1524
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:52,040
After all, people used to say, oh, it's

1525
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,400
all about the hallway track, and I thought,

1526
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,680
that's a waste of money.

1527
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,560
You are irresponsible.

1528
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,840
You should be taking advantage of that time and learning.

1529
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:01,000
And not that that isn't part of going,

1530
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,080
but now here I am, like, 10 years into that plus,

1531
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:07,360
and it's like, oh, you know what really is the best part is

1532
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,720
seeing people catching up, talking

1533
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,840
about what they're doing, problems they're solving.

1534
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,840
It's really way more valuable than you realize.

1535
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,280
That's the community right there.

1536
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:16,120
I really like having a mix.

1537
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:18,600
The hallway track's great in getting to talk to people,

1538
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,720
but also there are some talks that, hey,

1539
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,800
I want to see that live, like right now, and ask questions.

1540
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:27,200
And it's just off-putting not being able to get into a room.

1541
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,280
Yeah.

1542
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:29,640
I still think we're going to have

1543
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:32,000
to find our way over there sooner rather than later.

1544
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,080
I know.

1545
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,200
I know.

1546
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,640
Yeah, although I kind of like, like,

1547
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:39,920
Linux Fest Northwest is about as big as I like.

1548
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:43,080
Scale is a little too much for me.

1549
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:46,000
And Texas Linux Fest is the perfect size for me,

1550
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,040
but I think it could also grow a bit.

1551
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:51,160
But there's a different, there's like a sort

1552
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,840
of a diminishing return on results

1553
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,040
when it starts getting too big.

1554
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:56,720
Right, and it becomes a little more chaotic and a little less

1555
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,080
sort of community feel.

1556
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:59,480
Could you imagine like another couple thousand

1557
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,640
at Linux Fest Northwest?

1558
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:01,160
That'd be tight.

1559
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:01,920
It'd be a lot.

1560
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:02,480
It'd be a lot.

1561
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,600
It's a nice campus, but it'd be a lot.

1562
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:07,480
OK, well, do check out the resources for FOSDEM.

1563
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:10,040
There's a lot to dig into, and it's still pretty neat

1564
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:13,280
to see a community-funded event like this going strong now

1565
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,000
for 20 years.

1566
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,360
And you're right, Wes.

1567
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,720
We do need to make it over there.

1568
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:19,080
All right, some picks?

1569
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:19,920
Of course.

1570
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,760
All right, before we exit this week,

1571
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,480
I want to follow up on something we just sort of tossed out

1572
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:24,960
recently.

1573
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:28,560
We said, there's that really cool thing

1574
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,120
you can run on the terminal that makes

1575
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,520
it look like you're doing a bunch of really cool hacker

1576
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:33,440
work.

1577
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,160
And yeah, we figured it out.

1578
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:38,880
It's called Hollywood, and it's available as a snap.

1579
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,520
Created by Dustin Kirkland.

1580
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,400
Yeah, yeah, and he's also published it

1581
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,880
as a Docker container.

1582
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:46,760
Oh, he can just go get it off of GitHub.

1583
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,560
It's the perfect thing to put up in a terminal window

1584
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:50,960
and put on a virtual desktop.

1585
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,840
And then anytime you need to look like you're

1586
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:55,280
working on something that's unbelievable that only Linux

1587
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,740
could do, you flip over to that.

1588
00:58:56,740 --> 00:59:01,760
He calls it Hollywood because it is quintessential kind

1589
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,040
of Hollywood crazy stuff going on your screen that looks

1590
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,200
like hacker-type activities.

1591
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:07,820
And I love it.

1592
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:08,520
I love it a lot.

1593
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:11,240
And he was tweeting Elon Musk last week.

1594
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:12,920
This is how I came across it again.

1595
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,720
He was tweeting Elon Musk, encouraging

1596
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:17,480
him to integrate it into the Tesla screens.

1597
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:20,880
Wouldn't that be amazing?

1598
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:21,960
And I'm like, yes.

1599
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:22,840
And it's running Linux, right?

1600
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:23,680
Isn't that thing running Linux?

1601
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:24,560
Of course.

1602
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,120
So I think you should get in on that.

1603
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,320
It really is impressive, too.

1604
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:29,180
I mean, they put in some time into work

1605
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:32,480
to get a diverse array of different technical information

1606
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,480
with all the fancy Unicode you could want.

1607
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,760
It's so great.

1608
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:39,600
And it pulls in a few bits, like your user name and stuff.

1609
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,920
So you can see a few things in there

1610
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,160
that look kind of legitimate going by.

1611
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,800
And then this one has been on our Get To list

1612
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:49,680
for a long time, in fact, so long that I haven't tried it

1613
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:50,920
recently.

1614
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:51,760
Is that a word, Wes?

1615
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:52,800
No.

1616
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,800
It's recently.

1617
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:55,720
You're close, though.

1618
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:57,000
So close, Wes.

1619
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,440
It's called SharePoint Sync.

1620
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:01,080
And it's an AirPlay audio receiver.

1621
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:03,520
So if you got yourself a receiver.

1622
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,680
I was confused by that at first.

1623
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,800
What's the problem?

1624
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,040
You explain it.

1625
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,600
Well, here's your use case scenario.

1626
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:11,280
But there's lots.

1627
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,320
I mean, you could toss this thing on an old Pyskys,

1628
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:15,020
hook it up to a speaker, and then you just

1629
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:16,520
got yourself a $50 home button.

1630
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:17,040
You know what I'm saying?

1631
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:17,560
There we go.

1632
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:19,960
But here's the more practical use case.

1633
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:22,200
Say you got yourself one of those iOS devices, which

1634
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,880
I know you don't, but let's just say you did.

1635
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:24,560
Sure, sure.

1636
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:26,640
There is a scenario that those of us

1637
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:29,400
who are listening to a podcast on the road run into when

1638
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,640
we get to work and we want to continue

1639
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,260
listening on our desktop speakers, where

1640
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:35,840
we got nicer speakers, you want to keep listening.

1641
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,840
So what you can do now is you get out of the car.

1642
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,080
You walk into the old office.

1643
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:40,080
You sit down at the old desk.

1644
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,800
You've got this running on your machine.

1645
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:43,040
You can hit this button.

1646
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,660
Your Linux box starts receiving the audio from your phone

1647
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:47,160
and starts playing it over your desktop speakers.

1648
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:48,280
You finish off the podcast.

1649
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,680
So that is neat.

1650
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,400
That's why I wanted it.

1651
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,200
That's why I got it.

1652
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,360
I kind of like you capturing from that proprietary world

1653
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:58,440
and playing with it right there in Linux.

1654
01:00:58,440 --> 01:00:59,920
And once you get it in Linux, you think about it.

1655
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,080
You could probably capture the audio pretty easily.

1656
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:03,240
You could do anything with it.

1657
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:04,440
So it's called SharePoint Sync.

1658
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:09,040
I don't know why they call it Microsoft's intranet name

1659
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:09,560
thing.

1660
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:10,920
SharePort.

1661
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:11,960
Oh, thanks.

1662
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:13,400
What is the matter with me?

1663
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,760
It's like once it's in the old noggin,

1664
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,760
once my peepers read it one way and put store it

1665
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:21,040
in the old noggin, that's just how it comes out.

1666
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,720
SharePoint wouldn't make any sense.

1667
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,000
That's the Microsoft thing.

1668
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,320
That would be a dumb name for a product like this.

1669
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,720
Although I'll be honest with you, SharePort, not much better.

1670
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:29,880
But you get the idea.

1671
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,040
Looks like a great project.

1672
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:31,640
Yeah.

1673
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:34,520
And it's supposedly, suppose, supposedly,

1674
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:38,440
suppose to synchronize with the AirPlay video tracking.

1675
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:41,200
So if you're watching a video on your internet phone,

1676
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,720
it'll be in sync with the audio coming out of the speakers.

1677
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:45,120
That is impressive.

1678
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:45,800
Yeah.

1679
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:49,640
And he has gone to extra care, as he puts it,

1680
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:53,800
to work well with Pulse Audio on desktop Linuxes.

1681
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:56,280
That's neat too, just like having your iOS device

1682
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:57,480
show up right in Pulse.

1683
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,000
Yeah.

1684
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:58,520
Awesome.

1685
01:01:58,520 --> 01:01:59,360
Kodi does it too.

1686
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:00,360
Kodi, it works in Kodi.

1687
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:01,880
Kodi, you can go into Kodi and turn this on.

1688
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:04,120
They're doing their own thing to make this possible.

1689
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:07,000
So you can also do it to like a TV hooked up

1690
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,720
to like some nice speakers with the old Kodi.

1691
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:10,600
That'll work as well.

1692
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:13,400
Turns out a lot of Linux users also have iPhones.

1693
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,600
Well, maybe.

1694
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,080
Maybe, or maybe it's just me.

1695
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:17,440
But now I'm just open about it.

1696
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,240
You know, I used to be ashamed, but yeah.

1697
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:21,560
Ain't nothing wrong with that.

1698
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:23,440
Oh, I think they're both great, honestly.

1699
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,080
I mean, the truth of the matter is I have a Pixel as well.

1700
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:27,120
And a PinePhone now.

1701
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:29,520
Yeah, and an iPhone.

1702
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:32,680
God, what is the matter with me?

1703
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:33,520
This is ridiculous.

1704
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,440
We've got to get out of here.

1705
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,360
I need to go do some reflecting on all of this.

1706
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:38,800
Maybe stop by the pawn shop.

1707
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:41,200
We need some more SIM cards.

1708
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,840
Actually, I did get a SIM card in.

1709
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:43,840
Got a Ting SIM card.

1710
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:44,360
Ting.

1711
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:45,720
Tell us a little more about Ting.

1712
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,120
You know, if you go to last.ting.com.

1713
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:49,560
I wonder if it's still there.

1714
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:50,200
I don't know.

1715
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,360
But you get $25.

1716
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:55,000
And listen, most Ting bills are around $23 or $24 a month

1717
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:55,520
there, cheese.

1718
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,920
So you can pay for your first month.

1719
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:00,320
All right, well listen, we're getting out of here.

1720
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:01,360
Be sure to tune in live.

1721
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,160
It's a lot of fun.

1722
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,360
It's a huge mumble room.

1723
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:05,520
You can get information if you just Google search for Jupiter

1724
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:06,160
colony mumble.

1725
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,560
The show is live on Tuesdays, jupiterbroadcasting.com,

1726
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:10,440
so that's calendar in your local time zone.

1727
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:12,240
And we'll see you back here next Tuesday.

1728
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:42,200
Hey!

1729
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:54,560
JBtitles.com. Everybody go vote. We got to get our titles in. JBtitles, JBtitles.com.

1730
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:55,560
Everyone go.

1731
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:56,560
We literally can't do it without you.

1732
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:59,800
Go vote. And also, I just want to take a second again and say, Dusty, I've been wanting you

1733
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:05,760
to join us forever. So I'm really glad that Carl twisted your arm and got you to do it.

1734
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:06,760
You work with CoreOS, right?

1735
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:07,760
Yep, that's right.

1736
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,240
What do you do with CoreOS?

1737
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:14,640
It hasn't changed a whole lot since the last time I interviewed with you, but mostly helping

1738
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:20,040
do the engineering side of things with Fedora CoreOS and also a little bit of community

1739
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:21,040
stewardship there.

1740
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:26,000
Okay, all right. So help me understand. So when you say this, really, it's Fedora CoreOS

1741
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,260
you work on now, not CoreOS anymore. So that's where I'm confused. So you're not actually

1742
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:35,000
maintaining or are you maintaining both of them? Are you doing that until September?

1743
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,520
What is the situation there?

1744
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:46,080
Yeah. So within our teams, we try to separate out the terminology a little bit. So for example,

1745
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:54,080
if you talk about the old offering from CoreOS Inc., we call that Container Linux because

1746
01:04:54,080 --> 01:05:01,160
they renamed it, I guess, a while back before any Red Hat acquisition or anything like that.

1747
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:08,040
So it's called Container Linux. And then if you're talking about some of the new offerings,

1748
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:14,280
we either call it Fedora CoreOS or there's the enterprise offering that OpenShift runs

1749
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:21,140
on top of that's called a RHEL CoreOS or some people call it Red Hat CoreOS.

1750
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:28,760
And so if somebody says CoreOS, they're referring to RHEL CoreOS, which works with OpenShift?

1751
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:32,360
When somebody says CoreOS, we have to ask them what they really mean.

1752
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:35,840
That's what I was trying to get to about you.

1753
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:38,240
He's not going to give you a clear answer on purpose.

1754
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:48,200
Yeah. So I primarily work on Fedora CoreOS that feeds into the Red Hat CoreOS piece that

1755
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:54,680
OpenShift runs on top of. So I do work there as well anytime bugs need to be fixed or whatnot,

1756
01:05:54,680 --> 01:06:00,580
I participate in those duties. But as far as Container Linux goes, I don't personally

1757
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:07,200
touch that as much just because the team of people who were doing that already had a lot

1758
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:12,640
of the knowledge. We did some cross pollination there. We have had some of our new team members

1759
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:18,000
run some of those processes to do releases and stuff, but we don't touch them as much

1760
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,680
as the people who were responsible for them before the acquisition.

1761
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:33,000
So you were on in 2018 around June. So how much has your role shifted since? I mean,

1762
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,280
that's quite a while ago now, a year and a half. How much have things shifted for you

1763
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:37,800
for your day-to-day roles?

1764
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:46,000
It's mostly the same. We've had a lot of work that we've done in the community, just taking

1765
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:51,760
the two projects, the Atomic Host project and the Container Linux projects and putting

1766
01:06:51,760 --> 01:07:00,660
them together has been quite a lot of work. Just mainly because Container Linux, the model

1767
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:10,000
there with the streams is pretty different than what Fedora is typically built on today.

1768
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:16,960
So with Fedora, we have rawhide, we have updates testing, we have updates. And that model is

1769
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:22,960
a little bit different than what Container Linux had with the alpha, beta stable.

1770
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:30,400
And so what we've tried to do is mold the Fedora model a little bit to get a stable

1771
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:36,760
and testing stream as well as something that we're calling Next, which is not quite what

1772
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:44,680
alpha was for Container Linux, but we'll more closely follow what rawhide is, or what the

1773
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:48,880
branch next release is for Fedora Core OS.

1774
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:54,440
So we've kind of gone through a lot of like, oh, evaluate what Container Linux was, their

1775
01:07:54,440 --> 01:08:00,720
release processes, their guarantees to the community, the technology underneath, evaluate

1776
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:06,880
what Atomic Host was, its relationship to Fedora, what kind of community we had, what

1777
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:11,820
are the things we wanted to support, what are the things we didn't want to support.

1778
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:18,760
And it's just been a very large effort to resolve all of those things, and then put

1779
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:24,280
it all together and start to build steam, start to do releases every two weeks, and

1780
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:28,560
start to exercise those release processes that we've recently defined.

1781
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:36,000
Wow, no kidding. Do you have a rough sense of the size of the Container Linux user base?

1782
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,600
Is it hundreds of thousands? I mean, do you have a rough ballpark number? I was looking

1783
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:45,000
at the transition plan and it looks like there's flat car for them if they want something that's

1784
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:49,940
a direct migration, but it looks like there's not a perfect solution for all particular

1785
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:57,000
use cases. And I wonder if this is like, are we talking like, is this a ginormous market

1786
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,400
disruption or is this going to impact a few thousand people? Like what's the ballpark

1787
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:01,400
figure there?

1788
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:09,760
Yeah, so I don't know exact numbers there. You know, it's definitely not less than 10,000

1789
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:18,200
and it's not, it's not a million either, right? But, you know, they had some, I guess, data

1790
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:24,240
on how many users were checking in on a daily basis. And then they also got data from different

1791
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:29,720
cloud providers letting them know, all right, here's how many instances were spun up, you

1792
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:38,640
know, in a given month or whatnot. And, you know, I'm not sure how reliable, you know,

1793
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:46,080
the numbers that I know about are, but it's not a small market and it's not a huge market

1794
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:51,280
either. It's somewhere in between. But what we've tried to do is communicate from the

1795
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:57,520
beginning about differences that are going to happen with, you know, the migration from

1796
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:04,600
what container Linux was and give people enough information from the beginning to be able

1797
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:11,280
to, you know, make decisions for what they need to do in the future. Fedora Core OS has

1798
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:16,680
had a preview came out in July of last year. So we've been taking feedback from community

1799
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:23,380
members, you know, ever since that came out and really trying to, you know, not just drop

1800
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:29,820
anybody right on their face. But luckily flat card does exist as well. So we had a guy come

1801
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:35,280
in earlier today and was like, Hey, can I migrate from container Linux? And unfortunately

1802
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:39,800
the answer is no, because it's a completely different model, right? We, we, our updates

1803
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:45,520
aren't based on a block device is based on a file system, right? So the answer is no,

1804
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:50,480
he can't directly upgrade his existing container Linux node to Fedora Core OS.

1805
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:54,160
You could probably move the container workloads though, if you set up a new host.

1806
01:10:54,160 --> 01:11:03,200
Exactly. Yeah. Part of the idea behind container Linux itself was that you essentially define

1807
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:10,480
how that node is going to be started and provisioned using Ignition from the beginning, right?

1808
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:16,600
And so if you define everything about that node in this one, you know, Ignition config,

1809
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:21,580
which is JSON, then you should be able to take that Ignition config to any number of

1810
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:27,280
nodes and just spawn them off, you know, just start them up, right? Um, so the idea there

1811
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:31,880
is that you encode everything that's needed for this node to know what it needs to do

1812
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:38,440
in life, um, in that config. And then it's really easy to start new nodes, right? So

1813
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:45,080
the idea there is, uh, you know, migration, as long as they have a configuration file

1814
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:49,720
that defines what that node's life is, or view of the world is, uh, is not that big

1815
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:56,000
of a deal because honestly, um, you know, spawning new instances should be kind of

1816
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:02,280
normal day-to-day stuff in, in our, um, you know, more cloud native world, right? There's

1817
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:06,820
existing bare metal instances that kind of don't live by that model, but we're trying

1818
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:12,880
to get people more to that model. Um, and so unfortunately for this guy, his case was

1819
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:18,520
that he was in a different state than where his server was, and he also didn't have any

1820
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:24,900
sort of lights out management for that server. So fortunately for people like that, um, there

1821
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:31,240
is flat car, right? So, you know, we're actually appreciative of that project existing for

1822
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:37,680
people to have somewhere to go if they really can't migrate to Fedora Coral West. But, um,

1823
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:42,080
you know, that's just an example of a community spawning up where a need exists, right?

1824
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:46,880
I love that. Um, well, I'm glad you're able to stop by and update us. I encourage you

1825
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:52,520
to join us anytime you have the time and I'll leave you, uh, with a bit of advice. If Carl

1826
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:56,420
ever tells you something's good eats, you trust that man at his word. He knows good

1827
01:12:56,420 --> 01:12:57,420
food.

1828
01:12:57,420 --> 01:13:18,520
That's all the time we have for today's episode of Fedora Coral West. We'll see you next time.
