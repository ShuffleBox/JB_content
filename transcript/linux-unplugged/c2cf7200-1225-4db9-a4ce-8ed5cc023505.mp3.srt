1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
It is really fun. There was a there was a very fun and sort of rewarding feeling

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,040
to be sitting in a gravel parking lot that I just kind of found somewhere not

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,540
connected to anything and broadcasting and doing a show. Totally free just yeah

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:21,520
like it's like whoo like no wires no connection just I plopped down and I'm

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,800
streaming on the internet and you know one of the funniest things when that

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,200
happened is that's when that's when Anthony found us and came up and joined

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,520
us for Linux Unplugged. It was like totally random and awesome and I didn't even

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,600
realize the time was part of a vlog that he was doing so like he had started he

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,560
had started like watching us on the rover as we came into town and so he was

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,400
doing his overall vlog update to his YouTube channel and so hit the visit was

11
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,960
part of the update so it was like a show within a show happening and I didn't

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,640
even know it until the end. How about that? This is Linux Unplugged episode 113

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,920
for October 6th 2015.

14
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,200
Welcome to Linux Unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's once again

15
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,360
broadcasting from the JB one studio my name is Chris and my name is Wes. Hey

16
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,280
Wes it's good to be back with you sir. Pleasure to have you. You and Noah did a

17
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,280
great job last week fantastic it was actually a really good collaborative

18
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,840
production by the whole crew producer RottenCorps and the producers helped out

19
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,240
a lot you were great Noah was fantastic. He sure was. I heard he was the Segway

20
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,080
master. Yep oh yeah you might learn a trick or two from him. Yeah yeah the

21
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,840
Segway master I love it although when you combine Google Glasses with the

22
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,600
Segway that's a pretty nerdy image. Yep half robot half Noah. That's a strong

23
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,400
brand so thank you to Noah for sitting in there for the show and I actually

24
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,480
invited him to make it I'd invite him if he could make it he said he's pretty

25
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,400
busy today but he might be able to stop by later in the show. Hey that'd be fun.

26
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,800
Might join us in the Mumba room so we'll just see. You know on today's episode we've

27
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,800
got a few things we're gonna dig into. Number one it's Microsoft Day happy

28
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,280
Microsoft Day everybody did you enjoy that? Was that good for you? Yeah they

29
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,840
actually had a pretty respectable showing they unveiled the Surface Book

30
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,380
now we're gonna look at and see if it's possible it could run Linux and what

31
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,480
that would mean and you might be surprised at the answer about that then

32
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,040
later on in the show we're gonna talk about keeping Linux performing well over

33
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,440
the long time I'm talking about desktops I went away on the road trip as you guys

34
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,040
know and when I got back my tried-and-true my favorite workstation the

35
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,600
one that never disappoints is not running very good and we're gonna talk

36
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,460
about ways to maybe speed up your Linux system if it starts to slow down over

37
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,160
time and maybe hopefully get some input from the Mumba room and then last but

38
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,640
not least we're gonna talk about some updates from the Linux development

39
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,440
community so before we dive into all of that stuff let's bring in the Mumble

40
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:48,640
room time appropriate greetings virtual lug. Hello you guys it's good to hear you

41
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,360
without dropping about 75% of my packets that's nice now I know I actually have a

42
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,720
good connection oh yeah that's cool that's cool all right so I wanted to

43
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,320
start with something that came out yesterday it's just sort of a warm-up to

44
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,560
the show today and perhaps maybe something we all should consider a

45
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:11,600
possibility of a world without Linux yeah well sort of this is the Linux

46
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,120
foundations attempt to kind of make us stop and think what would the world be

47
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,880
like if Linux hadn't come along and they just released episode 1

48
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:31,480
hey what's the name of that Michael Jackson song oh how does it go

49
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:38,840
right you know the one huh da da da da he something like that oh yeah shoot

50
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:46,560
what is it um let me look it up

51
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,400
he goes to the library obviously that's how you look things up there's no

52
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,640
internet got it Billie Jean Billie Jean now it's

53
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:01,880
nighttime a world without Linux would mean a world without the internet

54
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:09,040
did that come out I think you're going to need these picks up the keys a world

55
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,200
without Linux is hard to imagine thanks to hundreds of thousands of individuals

56
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,760
and companies who support Linux we don't have to learn more and help support

57
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:22,680
Linux today hashtag world without Linux of course there's a hashtag well there

58
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,800
has to be yeah yeah so there you go the Linux so it's not bad right that's not

59
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,520
so bad they're gonna have another episode are we there yet and then they're

60
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,840
gonna have they're gonna like four episodes what do you think West I think

61
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,120
North Ranger in the IRC's got it down the BST folks probably will not

62
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,280
appreciate this that said I think it's good to point it you know well Linux may

63
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,880
not be the only free internet scale you know operating system that exists it is

64
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,600
widely deployed and it gives us a lot of freedoms that we would not otherwise

65
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,840
have so I'm glad that they're doing this some of the points might be a little

66
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,160
strong-armed but it was a nice video yeah the production value yeah it's okay

67
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,800
yes that's actually good it was good production value I know Poby is excited

68
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,480
about this next update I just wanted to talk about real quick before we get into

69
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:07,360
the main show and it's the n1 it's a beautiful open source email app for

70
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,160
Linux and it clocks in at a pretty hefty think like 20 megabytes or something

71
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,600
like that but it's it's like it's here to kick Thunderbird 64 64 megabytes

72
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,440
thank you that was 20 Wow and does anybody know like West you have a guess

73
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,840
why it clocks in at 64 megabytes those static dependencies I believe it would

74
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:32,200
be based on top of chromium it's like it's like Haru pad or Adam right the

75
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,000
chromium and no jazz I think is bundled in there as well you got a no jazz for

76
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,480
the events yeah naturally so I don't know do we hate this or are we okay with

77
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,840
giant applications look at look okay what if we get a really great functional

78
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:50,360
app that comes with Linux support out of the box don't we don't we like that you

79
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,160
know if it if it works really well I'm mostly curious to see how personal

80
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,800
deployments of the back end servers go that's what's gonna make it a break

81
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,480
it from yeah yeah what do you think wimpy yeah I agree I'm actually I've

82
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,640
just received my activation key for it so I'm actually oh great eating it right

83
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:11,960
now yeah okay but yes I'm I'm interested as well to know how the back end

84
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:17,120
integration is going to work longer term so are we just don't just what don't

85
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:24,720
give them your like primary email account because yeah right well the

86
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,280
sync engines open source right so I mean people could go poke around in there and

87
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,960
well I guess it probably I guess if the server is closed up I'm not sure what

88
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,960
the code of the server license of the server is but I assume the server is

89
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,080
open source too if you're installing it right yes okay so alright do we not then

90
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,400
hate the fact this is a 64 megabyte application that you have to run just to

91
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,080
check your email no I don't care I don't care the file size that's tiny really if

92
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,600
it means it's gonna work and it means that when they do an update the thing

93
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,880
isn't dependent upon some other random library on my system it all just works

94
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,400
that's great yeah especially if that means it's easy to deploy to you know

95
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,680
random machines that you just need it to work oh right that's a good point too

96
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,720
huh all right I think I'm gonna containers as well I think you could like

97
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,240
slap this in the container and you're done you know you don't have a truckload

98
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,440
of dependencies that it needs all right I'm signing up for I'm asking for an

99
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,800
invite right now boom oh look I can connect my github account isn't that

100
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,960
lovely all right I'll do that too I'm not sure why I have to oh okay you have

101
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:30,200
to do that and and star it and that speeds up your I wouldn't hurry too much

102
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,400
because it doesn't work oh thank you thank you all right well I did it

103
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,680
anyways please try to connect to your account again try again something went

104
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,640
wrong so yeah okay so we're we're starting to see a more and more

105
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,920
applications like I mentioned another one that I believe is also built so

106
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:53,600
similar to n1 is heru pad which is the the markdown editor I use which I not

107
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,760
only love but now I consider to be essential tool one of the things it does

108
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,840
is not only does it hotkey all the markdown stuff but it does live

109
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,900
rendering and you can apply your website CSS file to that live rendering so you

110
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,280
literally see what it looks like on your website as you're writing it you know

111
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,880
the fonts and the way you you know the way the block quotes look and

112
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:14,200
everything it's just such a fan but here's the downside I mean this is a

113
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,600
pretty fast system of course I just launched it so it's probably gonna

114
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:21,160
launch pretty quick but I just clicked it I mean it's it's it's heavy I can

115
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,960
tell it it's it's one of the slowest launching applications I have in my

116
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,400
desktop and it's a damn text editor right yeah I find that people have

117
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,000
similar complaints with it does not me just a little bit right but I don't

118
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,920
give anyone a shot so all right cool guys well wimpy let me know how far you

119
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:39,840
get in the process well I'm a bit further along but now it won't actually

120
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,400
proceed through this I'm at the point where it says choose your layout style

121
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:49,440
and there's a button says looks good which doesn't we have a layout style

122
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,640
called looks good that would probably never but now you've got list view or

123
00:08:53,640 --> 00:09:01,040
split view so I can I can select those and I can say what key bindings I use

124
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:07,400
so gmail Apple Mail or outlook your options and interesting good looks good

125
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:13,720
and that's me clicking the mouse and it not doing anything I managed to get my

126
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,560
my install done before you lot all jumped on it so I was playing with it

127
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,920
early in the morning and was like yeah this is good then I tweet it and it all

128
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,320
breaks and they put a paywall invite thing in front of it so oh so poppy what

129
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,200
jumped out at you the kind of you were impressed by when you say it's good so I

130
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,440
like the UI it's quite clean it's very familiar if you're using if you're a gmail

131
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,200
user it's very obvious what's going on you've got the folders down the left and

132
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,760
the emails in the middle and then you get some detail about the contact on the

133
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,760
right-hand side it's quite pretty I'm just very wary about the fact that this

134
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:52,360
server can retain my email for 60 days even after I revoke their access to my

135
00:09:52,360 --> 00:10:00,300
email that's yeah yeah okay it's working now oh so are you guys there is like a

136
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:07,760
couple of apps there's like a mailbox is one but Google bought them but inbox is

137
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,440
another it's sort of similar for it's like a mobile it's a mobile app that

138
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,640
does something similar like it's almost proxies the mail and then categorizes

139
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:18,560
it for you it's becoming like a service that is a little creepy and so that is

140
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,000
an area that see the problem with email right is that you get all your password

141
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,760
reset emails very personal you get I get credit card I mean credit card companies

142
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,880
are now starting to email statements they're like all this kind of stuff that

143
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,880
if somebody got compromised and it seems like anybody can get compromised these

144
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:40,200
days so I'm using a gash account to get it set up it's actually running now but

145
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,200
I had to go into Google Mail and actually tell it to have access to all

146
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:50,880
mail folders you can't use the you know what the tick boxes to filter out what

147
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,160
gets displayed in the mail client and basically somebody said it looks like

148
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,480
Google Mail it does it looks exactly like Gmail just in a window the way the

149
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:07,760
folders are laid out and I'm not actually a big fan of the Google Mail UI so I'm

150
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:14,600
just thinking what's the what's the USP here hmm I guess well it can connect to

151
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,320
multiple different accounts right it will it will look the same with it like

152
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:24,960
if you're if you like the the Gmail paradigm but the way you view mail this

153
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:30,120
thing can connect to Yahoo Outlook and all the others and you have that unified

154
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,080
interface so it all looks consistent rather than having four different user

155
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:37,040
interfaces for those four different accounts yeah plus I connect to your I

156
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:42,720
map but see I can do that but I can do that say with Gary right now and the

157
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,180
the other one that I was talking about earlier is Zimbra have a desktop mail

158
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:51,560
client Zimbra desktop and that has integration with all the popular email

159
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,400
services and it includes integration with you know your contacts and your

160
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:01,720
calendars and that's built on web technologies as well so that's a very

161
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:07,040
competent email client I think hmm I'm I'm I know and producer rotten corpse

162
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,680
would recommend claw right now I'm I'm I don't want to I don't want to

163
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,640
disparage you because I have a couple things they just inherently like about

164
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,800
it is it's it looks like a pretty good product that's just available day one on

165
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,680
Linux but now looking at these screenshots I can totally see what you

166
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,160
guys are saying about Gmail it yeah it's I would think that is a screenshot from

167
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:31,420
Gmail yeah yeah yeah so I do like though that it if you pulls in multiple

168
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,800
services I'm going to check it out I'm just not quite sure what it's gonna give

169
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,080
me I think I know it's gonna give me over Thunderbird Thunderbird just feels

170
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:43,640
like a 90s product now I mean I love it still it's my boo and I love the fact

171
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,520
that enigma is super easy to integrate with it that's my favorite thing about

172
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,720
it yes but Gary and now and one are knocking on the door and the thing is

173
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,080
email is a monster for me it is a demon that I have to slay a couple of times a

174
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,960
week and it is a take no prisoners event and I want anything that makes me get

175
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,200
through that as fast as possible and does a little tree and anything that

176
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,200
helps me triage is good and that's not really Thunderbird Thunderbirds strong

177
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,600
sweet and strong suit and it's just I could I am definitely looking for

178
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,520
replacement the one thing I like more about Geary is it feels like it's

179
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,600
faster to move through but important if you're doing a lot of emails yeah is

180
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,240
this I the one thing I like about this is the label support and the starring

181
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,680
and also it looks like a little bit of thread support and then you have reading

182
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,720
this helpful and you have contact information on the far right pane which

183
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,360
is useful for me too especially because then sometimes I can put faces to

184
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,520
listeners names and stuff and that's really nice for me so that that is I

185
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,360
something I achieved today through extensions that I would really like to

186
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,680
have that so this I mean I emails a serious enough task for me that I'm

187
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,040
willing to burn some drive space and CPU cycles on something that's a really good

188
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,280
tool yeah I'd love to go to use this for my my work exchange server yeah it'll

189
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,680
just all depend on that back end stuff yeah well they think they're gonna

190
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,760
support they do support plugins so somebody might be able to write an

191
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,240
exchange plug-in I think it supports exchange already no I'm just worried

192
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:10,000
about these data retention no way so if I can deploy it all locally yeah you

193
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,720
can't change mail retention yes exactly you don't want retention might not be

194
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,640
pleased yeah but wow it does have exchange

195
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:22,440
support yeah which is impressive I have to check out this open it's been in

196
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,720
development for nearly a year okay so looking at the github repository the

197
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:33,720
first commits for about 11 months ago and yeah it is working now so a little

198
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:39,480
bit of a bumpy start with them how it was you know getting the setup going but

199
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,720
now it's working now I found some of the options it's quite nice I use gearing

200
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,200
myself at the moment I've been using that for a month or so and I think I'll

201
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:54,360
give this a try basically I've just got mailing lists and everything on this

202
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,080
account hmm so I'll use it for that because that's where I get sort of

203
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:04,280
volume of email that I have to filter and work through so I'll give it a go

204
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:09,480
but um it does look nice once I've got it in split for you now and that looks

205
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,960
much better that's much more usable I might follow up with you and see how it

206
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:19,840
goes fascinated yeah all right good job thank you and one nice stuff they call

207
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,600
it a beautiful open source email app I don't know it does look like I don't

208
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,400
know if it's beautiful it does look pretty good though it looks kind of like

209
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,600
a Mac app to me yes it does look like a Mac don't know if that makes it

210
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:34,200
beautiful it's clear to it's clear to read good yeah the screenshots it does

211
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:39,360
look pretty nice yeah all right current anyway yeah yeah if you guys listening

212
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,240
at home want to check it out we have a link in the show notes I'll give a plug

213
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,440
now that I'm back there's probably gonna be one more rover log and the hat we

214
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,800
have them all posted now so far at Jupiter broadcasting comm slash rover

215
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,160
and there's some electrical stuff we did in there you guys probably heard about

216
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,440
last week the rover logs I'm just give them a plug because they've people have

217
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,640
been I think surprised when they watch them that they've enjoyed them they like

218
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,280
they thought I actually have been I've been surprised people enjoy them in fact

219
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,920
we've gotten some attention from YouTube over them as well they were featured on

220
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,440
the YouTube travel section which is pretty cool turns out you're pretty

221
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,400
interesting guy Chris well I don't know about that but the rover logs at least

222
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,080
work out to be interesting and so if you haven't checked them out there's

223
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,320
probably one more coming at least and then I'll decide where to go from that

224
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,960
and speaking of the rover you know one of the things that was awesome about the

225
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,720
road trip was the rovers internet was provided by ting you can go to right now

226
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,240
Linux dot ting comm to get our Linux unplugged discount and support the show

227
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,040
ting is mobile that makes sense as my mobile service provider and we have the

228
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,040
a netgear zing on the road and I you know for the most part the netgear zing I

229
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,520
really like it and sometimes it was a little slow for me just on the UI but I

230
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,120
very often had to interact with the zing seems like a really good product and I'm

231
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,120
I'm surprised that there's not more of them out there there and perhaps maybe

232
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,040
that's just because of the networks that ting's on ting has a CDMA and GSM

233
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,960
network and I was using the zing on a CDMA network and it's a really nice way

234
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,480
to go because now that I'm not going to be on the road trip this is not

235
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,800
something I would use a ton and that's what's really nice about the ting model

236
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,080
is in aggregate it's gonna save me a ton of money because you only pay for what

237
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,760
you use and there's no contract so it's six dollars to have the zing and six

238
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,760
dollars for any line and then you just pay for the usage on top of that well

239
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,920
say I go on a two-week road trip and I use a lot of data maybe that month I pay

240
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,240
for that data right but for the rest of the year I'm maybe not on a road trip

241
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:30,560
and it is incredibly cheap to have a my fi device ready to go on the ting CDMA

242
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,560
network now like I said ting does have two networks you probably have a pretty

243
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,760
good chance of having a compatible device and if you do and if you do when

244
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,240
you go to linux.ting.com they're gonna give you a service credit that'll

245
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,200
probably pay for more than your first month they also have an early

246
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,360
termination relief program which helps you get out of a contract if you're in

247
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,520
one of those duopoly contracts right now which come on let's be honest that

248
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,680
contract thing is starting to feel like a dinosaur you got to get out of it if

249
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,760
you're still in one and ting will help you save money you can go to their

250
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:59,760
savings calculator and putting your actual usage in there before taxes crazy

251
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,880
how much I'll save yeah I don't like to over $2,000 for two years which is

252
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,320
basically you could get a computer for that I think it's you know right now too

253
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,480
with the new with the new Nexus devices check this out West if you go to

254
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,680
linux.ting.com they're gonna take some money off these devices so these

255
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,240
devices are unlocked you own these right there's no contract when you buy them

256
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,920
and I'm flipping through them right now if you're watching the video version I'm

257
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,160
gonna land down here on the new Nexus devices where I just saw them here and

258
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,160
the Nexus 6p you can get it directly from Ting right there look at that that's

259
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:37,120
awesome the Moto X pure edition $399 unlocked directly from Ting LG Nexus 5x

260
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:43,520
$379 unlocked no contract pay for what you use $6 a month for the line comes

261
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:49,560
ready to go no problems that is nice that is really nice I I'm I'm attempted

262
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,920
I I'm they finally added a freaking fingerprint sensor to the Nexus and I

263
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,720
USBC yeah and those are I'm looking to try that that new standard out those are

264
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,680
check boxes that got ticked for me so you can get that one 379 when you go to

265
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,840
linux.ting.com and I think with this one they're gonna because that price is

266
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,000
already so low they're just gonna give you a service credit so quite literally

267
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,240
for 379 your first month you wouldn't probably even have to pay for it

268
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,760
especially if you're Wi-Fi savvy when it comes to data usage I mean it's $25

269
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,800
service credit is gonna last you that first month that's how low Ting is and

270
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:25,680
and you I mean that's oh that's a really actually a really sweet way to get that

271
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,960
phone unlocked linux.ting.com go over there check them out just see what they

272
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,920
offer try out their savings calculator see if maybe it works for you and a big

273
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,000
thanks to Ting for sponsoring Linux unplugged and thanks for the rover data

274
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,660
all right so today I couldn't help it because I was back doing tech talk today

275
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:44,720
in studio and I was immersed immersed in Microsoft Day and I just want to cover

276
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,400
it right really quickly on the Linux unplugged show the surface book yeah I

277
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,560
get it out of your system now they call it surface book was announced today and

278
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,680
be honest mumble room it's not a bad rig is it it actually looks like a pretty

279
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:04,200
impressive piece of kit anybody disagree pretty good so it just for those of you

280
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,480
that are not familiar with it it is a 13 inch laptop it has a high-resolution

281
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:14,080
like 246 or whatever is 214 ppi screen it's really high-resolution screen it

282
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:20,200
has i7 or i5 core processors it comes with an NVIDIA GPU with DDR 5 so it's a

283
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:25,880
pretty current NVIDIA GPU USB 3 connectors and the key feature about it

284
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,240
is that it breaks off and it actually also becomes a tablet when you break it

285
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,360
off from a tablet it still has pretty good battery life it switches to Intel

286
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,520
graphics on the fly you snap it back together and now it's it's a full-fledged

287
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,900
laptop and Microsoft has developed this latching technology that actually

288
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:45,760
electrifies the latch so it's not like a spring-loaded latch they created this

289
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,840
tough wire that they call it and when they add current to it it seizes and it

290
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,800
latches it and you're able to from the hands-on demos say you can hold the

291
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,720
laptop in the corner of the screen and bounce it and it feels like a solid piece

292
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,960
of connected machinery and then you hit the release valve and it discharges the

293
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,200
tough wire and it comes right out and it disconnects from the base now when it

294
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,800
disconnects from the base it goes to an integrated GPU but otherwise it remains

295
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:15,560
a pretty nice machine now here's the full specs it weighs in at 3 pounds 13.5

296
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:20,480
inch pixel sense display with 3000 by 2000 resolution which does work out to

297
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:26,600
be a 267 ppi as a sixth generation Intel core i5 or i7 processor that means you

298
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:31,000
get the HD graphics the 520 graphics and then the discrete is the NVIDIA GeForce

299
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,300
graphics you can get an 8 or 16 gigabytes of RAM up to a 1 terabyte of

300
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:41,840
SSD has 802.11 ACBGN Bluetooth 4 obviously 2 USB 3.0 ports and mini

301
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,560
display out 8 megapixel rear 5 megapixel front windows hello face

302
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:52,240
authentication and up to 12 hours of battery life ships with Windows 10

303
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:58,120
obviously price of 1499 base you get it with an i7 and even 512 megabytes of

304
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:02,160
storage now it is PCI Express storage and that price very quickly shoots up to

305
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:09,120
$2,700 in some of the configurations that we were trying but in the demos

306
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,400
they showed it actually has pretty impressive performance they showed live

307
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:18,640
transitions in premiere they showed live edits and AutoCAD and the thing can flip

308
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,160
around and and act as a tablet it can break off and just be a standalone

309
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,780
tablet but you can flip it around and have it on the keyboard still have the

310
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:31,000
GPU and discrete have our still and having tablet form factor we started

311
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,360
looking into the specs trying to figure out how likely this thing could run

312
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:39,040
Linux and PCMag had a hands-on at the Microsoft showing and they were looking

313
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:43,320
specifically at the latching mechanism and they talk about how the GPU is

314
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,800
located in the base of the system back where the keyboard is and supposedly a

315
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,240
pretty decent keyboard too and they say the latching mechanism has a wide

316
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,240
electrical connector and they say no doubt a PCI based interface to

317
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,960
facilitate communication between the GPU and the rest of the system so we were

318
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,600
speculating the pre-show that if this is a truly a PCI interconnect between the

319
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,440
top of the machine and this keyboard accessory it is very possible that the

320
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,920
keyboard and that trackpad are coming in over USB on that interconnect and the

321
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,200
battery obviously is coming over the PCI connector now we don't know exactly

322
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,400
what the solution would be for graphics but it's very likely this would work

323
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,720
with Linux yet that if it has enough standard compliance stuff that you know

324
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,840
we can with a little work people can get drivers adapted for that would be great

325
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:31,080
and I'm thinking worst case scenario you would have to just use the discrete

326
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:36,760
graphics or just the Intel graphics right if this was a reasonable approach

327
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,280
West if you if you were in the market for a really high-end quote-unquote

328
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:45,320
laptop and you wanted to run Linux I would consider it you know I mean it

329
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,720
depends on how well the laptop part works I do a lot of stuff on the command

330
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,440
line obviously but it's really interesting to see Microsoft as a

331
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,320
hardware vendor if they do make stuff that Linux can run then I wouldn't be

332
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,040
opposed to it you know I don't need their included bundled OS and let's say

333
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:05,200
let's say a work is buying well if it works fine yeah I would definitely

334
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,040
consider it yeah if it ran Linux with the you know only a reasonable number of

335
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,320
tweaks then I would definitely consider it so if yeah if you were like I say you

336
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,720
worked in a workplace and they were decided to start buying the Microsoft

337
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,800
gear I don't know I hope you would you like this would you try this would this

338
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:26,840
be something you'd be willing to run well well my first reaction is when you

339
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,560
when you suggest like you break down the connectors and how things interconnect

340
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:36,720
that's all magic and great but have you tried an Nvidia Prime or you know

341
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,560
bumblebee based system how long have they been around and they're two GPUs in

342
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:45,520
one laptop without any wacky connector that pulls them apart and puts them back

343
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,160
together again and we can't even get that working properly yeah let alone

344
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:53,720
something that dynamically appears and disappears off the PCI bus where there

345
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:58,480
may or may not be you know data currently in flight so then is this

346
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,440
Microsoft successfully bringing a type of convergence to the market in your

347
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:07,160
opinion no I mean we've seen this before there's this I mean that that

348
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:12,680
device is not glaringly different than the surface ASUS ASUS transformer or the

349
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,520
transformer yeah I mean or something like that if you think about it it's

350
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,000
not that much but really if you think about it it's not that much different

351
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,880
is it than the surface Pro well the fact that they've put some of the brains

352
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:30,360
inside the keyboard is a bit interesting and it's a bit different but I'm not

353
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,400
interested if it's if it's running Windows to be honest right yeah I don't

354
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,240
need yet another Windows machine yeah okay so anybody else in the mumble room

355
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,760
would you be tempted if maybe work was buying or the even for yourself if you

356
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,000
knew for fairly certainty that's in some way in some form Linux would work

357
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:57,240
anybody want to bite Sean I'm looking at you I'd bite but only if I could get

358
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:02,580
Linux running smoothly I won't have that Windows baloney on my system what if it

359
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:05,880
came down I see here's here's why I'm wondering if this is doable because I

360
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,760
think people make bigger compromises today to run Linux on a MacBook often

361
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,060
you know simple things like your Ethernet port doesn't work unless you

362
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:17,160
boot the operating system with it connected and that you have to figure out

363
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,920
how to get your webcam to work every time you want it to start and the

364
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,880
thermal controls are just recently been added there's a lot of compromises I

365
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,040
know I always bring this up but there's a lot of compromises people make for

366
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:30,640
their hipster hardware and Microsoft may have made a device here that may be

367
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,480
easier to run Linux on than the MacBook Pro we will have to see change things

368
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,800
I'm not it's I've still I've got a I've got a five-year-old MacBook Pro here and

369
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:46,080
they still doesn't run Linux the bar is not that high like they could do it this

370
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,920
to me is the real test of Microsoft by the way one of the things that Satya

371
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:53,160
set up on stage today is they don't want people to feel like they have to run

372
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:58,000
Windows they want them to they want to want to run Windows and we'll see if

373
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,960
that's true with this surface Pro or surface book sorry if it if it requires

374
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,480
Windows to make that magic work and it's not done at the hardware level then I

375
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,240
don't know how much I believe them in that statement but if this is something

376
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,640
that developers could buy and load any operating system they want on then I'm

377
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,400
starting to believe them I think this is a real good test because this is the

378
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,200
first time they've ever made a laptop yeah it's interesting in the new Satya

379
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,640
era yeah as they say and and I do I do agree I think the convergence

380
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,440
comparisons are a little are a little weak I've been seeing a lot of that

381
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,160
online it seems a little it's not really convergence the thing that's just a

382
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,640
fancy new connector really yeah tell me it's convergence when you open up

383
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:42,000
Internet Explorer windows file explorer tell me how converge that is yes it's

384
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,720
not convergence all right so any other thoughts guys on the surface I just

385
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,240
wanted to touch on it because it's like the big topic today everybody's

386
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,120
Microsoft blew it out of the park Microsoft stock went up a whole bunch it

387
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:56,240
was a pretty good presentation I got to give the guy that he at least had his

388
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:02,520
own take on it so any last thoughts going once twice all right we'll leave

389
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:06,160
that if you guys want to read the specs you can find the link in the show notes

390
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,840
I'll take a moment and mention digital ocean I love me some digital ocean

391
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,520
because they're a simple cloud hosting provider that's dedicated to making it

392
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,880
really easy to get your own Linux rig up on a cloud server that's super fast

393
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:20,520
they got tier one connections all connected to SSD drives and for like

394
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,760
five dollars a month you won't you won't believe how much you're gonna get so

395
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,360
you'll get start five dollars a month five dollars right here that's I less

396
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,480
than a hamburger a month you can get 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one

397
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:37,420
CPU and a terabyte of transfer but if you use our promo code do unplugged do

398
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:40,440
unplug that's one word lowercase then you're gonna get a $10 credit you can

399
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,480
try the $5 rig out two months for free there's so much you can do with that and

400
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,040
their pricing plans are really straightforward they step right up very

401
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,760
simply they have a whole bunch of distros you can choose from maybe it's a

402
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:53,020
good opportunity to play with core OS or free BSD hurts me hurts me a little bit

403
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:56,680
to say it West but they do have free BSL it's gotten to you well you got to

404
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,360
respect how they do it too like they work with the projects to make sure that

405
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,920
it's like totally legit and you're getting updates from the projects and

406
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,000
they're coordinating and then like they roll out a ton of documentation that's

407
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,880
really well written and edited and it's just like it's a full package deal and

408
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,400
ironically you know it's their commitment to using things like full

409
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,320
heart you know KVM virtualization that let them do this kind of thing oh yeah

410
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,600
oh for sure for sure and they just launched a new data center up in Canada

411
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:23,360
too so if you want to store some data up in Toronto they have tour one one of the

412
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,400
many data centers they have been New York Amsterdam San Francisco Singapore

413
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:31,480
London Germany and now one in Toronto and you can deploy up there it's they

414
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,440
have one-click application deployments too it's very very nice so just remember

415
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,040
do one plug also if you want to just build something around the digital ocean

416
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,160
infrastructure they have a really nice API that makes it very easy to develop

417
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,800
your own app to do deployments and because they have hourly pricing really

418
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,880
if you want to just be a boss like if you like say you're launching something

419
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,880
or maybe you've got a project and it's day one for very very very little just

420
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:57,080
like very like cents on the dollar you can run a digital ocean server hourly

421
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:02,360
just scale up as you need it using their API shut her down when you don't and

422
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,680
it's serious on-demand infrastructure it's really cool so just use our promo

423
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,160
code do unplug to support the show there's lots of different ways from own

424
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:14,200
cloud sync bit torrent sync sync thing X to go there's a lot of ways people in

425
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,280
our community minecraft mumble in most users our virtual lug is running off a

426
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:22,040
digital ocean droplet right now it's really cool do unplug is how you can get

427
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,040
started and a big thank you to digital ocean for sponsoring the unplugged

428
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:29,960
program okay I I can't believe I'm about to say this because I feel like I'm a

429
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,540
frickin Windows user all of a sudden little embarrassing not to be

430
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:36,160
derogatory to those of you listening using Windows I shouldn't said that but

431
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:41,440
I got back from my road trip and I said I mean I'm not even joking when I say

432
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,920
this is I love this machine so much that when I sat down on it for the first time

433
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,600
I got back from the road trip I got a little excited like I like oh I get to

434
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,080
use this computer again I've missed it does anybody if you know what if you

435
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,600
have a computer like that you know what I'm talking about it's your bae your boo

436
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:01,000
is that what the kids say okay yeah you're very hip I thank you thank you I

437
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,440
try it's I try to be very very hip it's it's my thing and and the value of this

438
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,960
is negative so I sit down to use this computer and something something

439
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:15,440
something bad happened something real bad happened producer Matt was clipping

440
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,320
shows for on filter like crazy and the Dropbox folder sitting on my home drive

441
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,280
grew to unbelievable sizes and filled up my home drive ouch XFS partition I

442
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:30,200
thought no big deal I went in uncheck some selective sync stuff deleted a few

443
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,560
dozen ISOs that had been sitting in my download folder for a while good to go

444
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,560
you know just those little things you forget about yeah time to time and I get

445
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:42,920
back I'm now 70% free on my home drive it's funny of space yeah however however

446
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:48,720
the machine is running like dog crap like it's taking applications very

447
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:54,000
noticeable load times I can hear the drive crunching like crazy I my flash

448
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,040
video is like all hyper sped up it's all weird all of a sudden like the machine

449
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:02,560
is just hurting and I've never really had this problem with Linux but you know

450
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:07,120
I noticed that the Linux Foundation has launched a Linux performance tuning

451
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:14,760
course LFS for 26 for the low low price of $2,500 and I change really I thought

452
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,440
I bet I bet here on Linux unplugged we could come up with a few performance

453
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:22,560
tips for absolutely free that are maybe not 20 maybe but not as good as the

454
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:26,880
$2,500 ones but I thought maybe with between you and I in the virtual lug we

455
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,700
can come up with a couple of tips to just kind of keep your Linux rig running

456
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,440
a top performance over its lifetime I'm not saying this is like registry

457
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,040
cleaning kind of tools and crap like that but you know just ideas maybe

458
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:41,800
to just tricks people have picked up along the way yeah and so I don't know

459
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,720
if you guys in the mumble room if you want to think of a couple and if you're

460
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,800
in the chairman you have one and you can join the mumble room feel feel free to

461
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,120
jump in the mumble room and make your suggestion but I'm gonna I'm gonna start

462
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,280
with the elephant in the room the one we're all gonna probably talk about

463
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:57,440
that's the swap file that seems like the easy one to go to now all of us have

464
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,760
plenty of RAM I'm sure maybe maybe not but I guess if you have to swap the

465
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,720
number one thing that I'm I'm feeling right now is I think my swap partition

466
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,560
is on the same drive as my home drive I think I made that mistake when I set it

467
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,960
up I'm gonna just say right here and right now if you've got an old SSD you

468
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,360
want to burn through really bad or something like that if you can try to

469
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,040
put your swap files on a separate disk I actually I know a lot of you probably

470
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,840
listening just completely disable swap and if anybody wants to make that

471
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:30,320
argument in the mumble room you're welcome to for me I'm not comfortable

472
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,800
yet I don't know if it's just because I used to I just to me it seems crazy what

473
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,120
if I need to debug a crash I don't know I don't know how this works without my

474
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:40,480
swap file so I just have to put I just mentioned out there if you need a swap

475
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,000
file try to put it on a separate disk I think that's one of the things that I am

476
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,200
for some reason feeling the pain of right now you can also mess with your

477
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:53,600
swappiness but I'll leave that to so like heavens in the in the chatroom says

478
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,520
I sweat my I set my swappiness value to one which depending on your swappiness

479
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:01,200
value is how likely your system's gonna go to use it I'm a con the chatroom says

480
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,120
that he hasn't used a swap file for a few years now I know that's really super

481
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:07,080
common yeah it is definitely yeah do you have you ran a system without a swap

482
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,320
file yeah I think some of mine do it's kind of hit or miss depending on when I

483
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,280
set them up and how I was feeling that day but what would be like the deciding

484
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,400
factor for you you know if it's if it's something where I'm running a more

485
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,960
defined set of software I'm not worried about crashes I kind of know what

486
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,640
performance I'm expecting yeah then it's fine yeah you have plenty of RAM yeah

487
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,800
and if I have plenty of RAM then it's not a big deal you know some systems you

488
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,640
can always you know is there some on there yeah mumble room anybody in there

489
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:36,520
going swap free forever oh no on some machines I'm already swapped for a yeah

490
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:43,720
now why is that would be if it's not a laptop and I don't need it for

491
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:50,280
suspending and hibernating okay then I just use that RAM instead for a swap

492
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:54,120
maybe I should maybe I should kill my swap file poppy you were sounded pretty

493
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:58,960
adamant that you you would always have a swap file yeah I never don't have a swap

494
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,120
file now is that for sleep reasons are you always on laptops or is there

495
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:07,960
another reason because disk space is cheap and there's no reason not to have

496
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,920
one that's kind of been my approach is it but now I'm wondering if maybe I'm

497
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,680
paying for it by having it on the same drive as my home folder well that's

498
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,240
what's using it it's only a problem if you're you if it's swapping that's why

499
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,000
it's that's why it's not a problem so if you're not using it why do you care

500
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,760
come on in the chat room says what a what is swap so think of swap is like a

501
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,520
space on your disk that's been allocated for the operating system to store stuff

502
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,040
that doesn't necessarily need to be in RAM so that way the stuff that needs to

503
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,680
be in RAM has space extra slow really horrible RAM yeah when your system is

504
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,520
going to swap you're in a usually you know in a bad state so I I might

505
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:46,320
consider just because you know I could turn it off I could swap off yeah and

506
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,880
just see see how it goes maybe you have some homework for next week yeah I'm

507
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,720
gonna I'm actually gonna write that down yeah go ahead you said that you were

508
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:00,000
running on XFS yes is that right yeah and you've just deleted and purged a

509
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:07,120
load of stuff mm-hmm have you checked the defragmentation status of the volume

510
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:11,160
no I haven't really they actually just did it this morning so I could definitely

511
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:15,320
do it check the frag check the defrag level like on a good old Windows box

512
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:22,800
yeah an XFS has got online defragmenting right so the the fragmentation factor

513
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:28,360
that it reports is between 0 and 100% and the closer to 0 the better so if

514
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:33,960
your fragmentation factor is up you know in the 70s 80s then time to defrag the

515
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:39,880
volume and the utilities exist to do that so you've got XFS underscore DB

516
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:46,160
which is for debugging but that's the tool that you can use to expose the

517
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:54,080
fragmentation factor and then there's XFS FSR which is the file system

518
00:36:54,080 --> 00:37:00,360
reorganizer and that can actually do the defragmenting I see yeah and I found

519
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:05,280
that ArchWiki actually has a really nice write-up on it yep naturally and there's

520
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:12,720
also XFS BMAP and you can use that to defragment individual files hmm so if

521
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,840
you've got a large ISO for example that has been downloaded whilst or many

522
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:25,920
fragmentation or something I mean I used to use it because I had large data files

523
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,840
from crash recorders or from aircraft hmm and I'd get loads and loads of those

524
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:34,040
and you'd find that in individually those were then fragmented and I could

525
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:38,880
defragment those and speed up the analysis time oh interesting made it

526
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,240
that much of a difference huh well oh yeah oh yeah significant it can it can

527
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:49,080
take your system from being sloppy and slow to being like you've just installed

528
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:54,200
it now rotten you wanted to make a special mention of but Abel but Abel yeah

529
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,520
I was gonna I would I don't know how to say it either but I would say like

530
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:04,720
baobab yeah yeah yeah now what is this it's a disk usually disk usage analyzer

531
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:09,960
mm-hmm oh yes of course yes yes that's a good one also West wanted to give a

532
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:14,280
plug for ncdu yes that's just you know one of those tools in my toolkit that I

533
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:19,400
turn to yeah much all the time nice and fast right love curses interfaces yeah

534
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:24,920
that's a that's also a good one I so I guess I guess I wanted things that so

535
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,280
I'm taking notes I'm gonna I'm gonna do the defrag obviously I'm gonna turn

536
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:33,600
swap off what are you guys's thoughts on West the the tool that you mentioned to

537
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,720
store your browser profile on RAM tell me about that oh yeah profile sync Damon

538
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,320
there's also anything sink Damon I'm not using them currently but I've used them

539
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,480
in the past and it just it just kind of transparently handles moving all your

540
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,320
browser profiles kind of stuff that can be resource-intensive to grab from the

541
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:53,360
disk or to frequently update on the disk so it keeps them in rain so this is a

542
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:56,760
Damon the design so I'm reading from the wiki here designed to manage user

543
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:01,520
specified directories referred to as sync targets from here on out and temp

544
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,960
FS and periodically sync them back to the physical disk this is accomplished

545
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,800
via sim linking step up and sim linking step and an innovative use of our sync

546
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,000
to maintain a synchronization between temp FS copies and the media bound

547
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:19,040
backups additionally and with there's a typo with features such as crash

548
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:26,120
recovery so ASD features okay so this so if I'm understanding West this is a

549
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:30,360
system sink Damon that sinks between my disk and a RAM disk and then it with the

550
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,360
applications end up using sim links which point to files in a RAM disk

551
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,920
exactly and then and it manages you know copies on the disk periodically so that

552
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,560
you if if your system goes down you won't lose everything that's pretty cool

553
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:47,040
that is that would I mean a big part of what I do is I'm sitting here doing show

554
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:51,440
prep or I'm or I'm showing a website on air it'd be really nice to have my web

555
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,520
browser performing really well and one of the things that seems to have taken

556
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,680
the biggest hit is my web browser yeah right and so you know especially if

557
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,840
that's that's the kind of workflow you have you ever used it yeah I've used in

558
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:05,600
the past I was using Firefox exclusively it was it worked pretty well though I was

559
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,800
happy with so there's two of them anything any anything sink Damon I'll

560
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,080
have a link to that in the show notes and then what was the other one profile

561
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:14,840
sink Damon which is made I think anything is an extension or outgrowth of

562
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:19,240
profile sink okay that one's just for browser profiles ah that might be a

563
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,520
little safer yes but this can be useful to if you have other applications that

564
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:27,000
you would like you know certain things to be in RAM I've played with not using

565
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,680
this but you know played with however having running your all your root system

566
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:34,600
in RAM people do that this is kind of fun this might turn into this might turn

567
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:39,280
into an ongoing series of me trying to run more and more crap out of RAM all

568
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,240
right so any other tips before I ask I'm gonna ask the doozy of the question

569
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,720
anybody else in the mumble room have any other performance tips they do on their

570
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:51,360
rig to keep things running fast anybody still do pre-linking anything like that

571
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:57,160
well Chris you said that you were running your home directory on SSD and

572
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:02,880
what I what I concern with is if you're running swap on there wouldn't that be

573
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,600
actually doing way more rights to the system than it should yeah I can if

574
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,740
you're using it yeah I can't remember how often I mean I only now have the

575
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:13,920
sense that maybe I'm swapping I in the general in the past I don't really ever

576
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,720
have the sense I'm actually using the swap file so that is a good question I

577
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:21,400
don't know how frequently it's being updated maybe another good reason to

578
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:26,280
swap off I only have SSDs in the machine and then I have a I have a raid

579
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:31,800
zero of drives I use for editing or Steam I mean to be clear you should also

580
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:36,040
know that most people if you have a significant amount of RAM you won't

581
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:40,200
really touch swap unless you're doing like high computations and stuff or a

582
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:44,040
bunch of virtual machines it's not a ton of RAM I think it's like 16 gigs it's

583
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:48,240
not like a ton which is kind of crazy that's that's a ton in consumer level

584
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:54,200
really is it though yeah yeah I run yes the average like a consumer starting

585
00:41:54,200 --> 00:42:00,840
thing is like four to two to four he's still no XPS 13 with four gigs that's

586
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:05,360
no they haven't gotten better about that yet now you can get six and eight and

587
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:09,720
stuff very commonly for about like 350 to 450 I can't even imagine less than

588
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:14,480
decent price how you gonna run multiple VMs with less than eight how you gonna

589
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,600
VM how you gonna do that come on get out of here get out of here don't you

590
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:23,520
optimize actually what I think them I can't no I I got actually I actually

591
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,480
could see it working especially with a lean Linux desktop I mean it's

592
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,840
definitely doable and containers will help you there yeah I could honestly see

593
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,280
getting by with less RAM especially if you're using on the server side I kind

594
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,920
of I'm half joking but at the same time I I really am kind of disappointed that

595
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,480
they're not selling it with more RAM these days because I really would like

596
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:46,040
to I mean I I would like to have like 32 yeah exactly when you go to five 500 or

597
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:52,680
more you get into like the 8 gig grams yeah okay I I guess for me I I I feel

598
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,920
like boy if I could afford it I'd be up 32 on most of my machines now okay

599
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:00,480
anybody have a thought because this is a suggestion that's coming to the show a

600
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,360
few times I've never actually I almost pulled the trigger on at once but I

601
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:08,400
never have actually switched out my IO scheduler now for those of you that

602
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,080
don't know you can get different schedulers in the Linux kernel it just

603
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:15,440
depends on which one it's built with that support different types of disk

604
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,360
input and output operations you could say so there's the CFQ scheduler the

605
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:23,320
completely fair queuing scheduler there's the NNOP scheduler and deadline

606
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:26,400
and then there's the one that probably is that the one that people know what

607
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:31,360
I'm talking about that the BFQ scheduler the budget fair scheduler and it's

608
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,720
available in some Linux branches right now and a lot of people say the BFQ

609
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:39,600
scheduler is significantly faster if you have SSD drives I don't actually know if

610
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:46,880
this is really worth the switch okay heavens heavens you can post the

611
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,520
correction in the chat room but this is my rough I'm giving you a layman's

612
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,680
understanding of how the how the how the BFQ scheduler affects disk IO operation

613
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:57,400
so essentially there is requests that come into the kernel and the kernel has

614
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,960
to handle a lot of things you know get something off a disk feed something to

615
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:05,080
somebody else talk to the network and the BFQ scheduler can give say preference

616
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:09,080
if you have an SSD drive to the disk IO scheduler versus the network controller

617
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:13,440
things like that right so BFQ is perhaps maybe another way to put it is more

618
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,640
bias towards the disk scheduler in a sense and so if I'm getting it if I'm

619
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:21,400
understanding correctly you say you have BFQ and as your as your overall queue

620
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:25,200
scheduler then your disk performance can be much higher instead of waiting to go

621
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,360
to the disk it more often goes to this now this is just based on what I've read

622
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:31,040
reading on people that have tried it and said that performance is way better

623
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,400
right and people are typically looking for responsiveness on the desktop yeah

624
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,800
and so for example a great example is you know if you have a bunch of GDK

625
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,520
dependencies in the background that are loading instead of just sitting around

626
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:44,160
there waiting for those GDK dependencies to finish BFQ might go check in with the

627
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,520
disk scheduler and see what it needs and take care of that for a minute and have

628
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,720
the data ready something like that is really layman's understanding but that

629
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:53,360
seems to be the end result which you see as a user is things open up much faster

630
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:56,680
you can run multiple applications you can launch multiple applications at the

631
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:00,040
same time in the launch while the disk is already being heavily accessed seems

632
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,840
to be the general takeaway from BFQ anybody in the mumble room ever played

633
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:11,280
with anything like this rotten yeah I do maybe yeah I do one I do on not so

634
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,680
powerful equipment I don't bother on more modern systems you do notice a

635
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:20,480
difference on so for example on the Raspberry Pi I definitely notice the

636
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:25,240
difference by changing the combination of file systems and IO schedulers and on

637
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:32,440
older much much older hardware sort of Pentium 4m type devices even retrofitted

638
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:38,080
with SSDs you can see a measurable improvement in disk performance by

639
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:43,600
changing my ways is that performance sort of show itself well the most

640
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:47,280
obvious one is that you can see that the boot speed is dramatically decreased

641
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,400
hmm that's a good time so that's probably launching of simultaneous files

642
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:58,240
and things like that just as yeah but where you really notice it is if you're

643
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:04,200
extracting a large archive in one process and browsing the web in the

644
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:09,400
other you don't get that stop start pausing you know and and stuttering as

645
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,880
you you know launching tabs and switching between tabs it all happens

646
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:18,640
far more fluidly mmm I like that usually I believe it a cost to the

647
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:24,800
decompression throughput but but that's fine if you use your desktop yeah right

648
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,960
right right right right and it's interesting because in a server

649
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:31,240
workload that might not be what you want no probably not but on a desktop work

650
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:35,480
now that is what you want and unlike I say I only do this on on the older

651
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:40,360
hardware where you know there's there's clearly measurable benefit on the newer

652
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:46,920
hardware that the differences are so so small it's not worth the time to tweak

653
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:51,480
it interesting I that was sort of my takeaway seemed like from the reviews I

654
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,680
was reading it was in some cases so a couple of them that were seemed pretty

655
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,880
obvious were simultaneous application launching like everything just remained

656
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:03,880
very fluid they all didn't nothing really stuttered it was all very smooth

657
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:08,160
but outside of that I didn't see huge differences and it seemed like a lot of

658
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,320
work for a minor return so that's why I was kind of putting it out there when

659
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:14,240
if people have actually experimented with it because every now and then when

660
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,160
I when I I guess what brought it up again is I remember watching that demo

661
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:22,280
and then today using this machine thinking oh these applications are

662
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:26,080
launching so slow and like I launched telegram which is not a huge app and

663
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:30,320
like everything seizes on the machine that was loading and stops loading for a

664
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:34,120
second like even the terminal window and it's this is performing horrible and I

665
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,520
started thinking I remember the BFQ scheduler was much better about

666
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,240
prioritizing these kinds of things on the desktop I saw I did a little reading

667
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:45,040
into it read a few reviews and it's I don't know it's something to try anyway

668
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:49,160
it seems possible and worth trying but I'm a little skeptical since nobody's

669
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:52,320
really building it in if I would imagine by now if it really made that much of a

670
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:57,080
difference some distro would be yeah I think one does I think one distro out

671
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:01,520
there based on arched I ship with it built in but yeah if you guys also does

672
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:06,600
the BFQ or BF that was the one I was thinking of yeah it's Abbey on and and

673
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,280
have you noticed any difference when you play with her have you played with it

674
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:14,440
I have played with it I haven't really noticed well from my personal attempts I

675
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:18,520
haven't really noticed much of a huge increase because I really noticed much of

676
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,200
a difference when I'm compiling and doing a whole bunch of stuff and it's

677
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:27,080
really stressing like my rig Sabian is built from Gentoo right not arch if I

678
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:31,880
recall yes yeah and I think one of the reasons I was drawn to try it from a

679
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:35,200
while ago was because it uses BFQ and I don't remember really noticing any

680
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,320
difference now I think about it but they you know out of the box they're trying

681
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:41,400
to make it as performant as possible and it's an interesting take on it so I

682
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,580
wonder I don't know we'll see where it goes there are some branches Linux

683
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:47,440
kernel out there that have it already too if you if you have any suggestions

684
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:52,520
Linux actually showed at reddit.com and look for a lucky episode 113 of Linux

685
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:56,400
unplugged and leave a comment in there and I'll try it if it's a reasonable and

686
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,440
quick I don't want to rebuild my kernel necessarily well that's that's what's

687
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:04,160
nice about the IO scheduler you can change that yeah yeah that was actually

688
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,640
one of the neat things about one of the demos I was watching is he would

689
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:10,240
literally turn he would switch them and you could watch it you could watch the

690
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:14,680
difference I think he was using Fedora and that was pretty remarkable so all

691
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:17,120
right you know another way you could maybe make your sister run a little

692
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,760
better is probably just learn more about it go over to linuxacademy.com slash

693
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:25,320
unplugged Linux Academy is the sponsor of the Linux unplugged program and man

694
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:28,880
do they have some really cool stuff coming up so on October 15th they have a

695
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,440
really big live show they're gonna do and they've been working on this thing

696
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,520
that I'm gonna I have the notes here but I can't tell you yet because it's a big

697
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:39,400
secret but they're working on it for a year and there's a lot of updates coming

698
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:42,600
not only that but they just rolled out a new HTML 5 player with a new CDN back

699
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:47,040
end so all of that great content works even better now and you know one of the

700
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,880
things about Linux Academy that really stands out is they allow you to choose

701
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:53,360
from seven plus distributions the courseware the virtual machines they

702
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:57,680
match that the other thing though is instructor help is available with that

703
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:01,960
stuff the stuff that the self-paced courses can still have actual instructor

704
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:05,480
help that's awesome they have new lab features that are launching later this

705
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:09,480
month a new practice exam phase one system will be launching this week and a

706
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,000
new community feature we're gonna hear more about very soon there's a lot of

707
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,280
really good stuff coming out also they have the new Linux Foundation certified

708
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,880
system administrators course and the Linux Foundation certified engineer

709
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,160
course have to definitely check that out and they're also proud to announce

710
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,840
they're an open stack corporate partner now so they're officially an open stack

711
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,640
training partner you can check that out too at Linux Academy go to Linux

712
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,880
Academy.com slash unplugged and learn about the whole stack around Linux

713
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:35,240
everything from small nuggets just deep dive into a single topic like using

714
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:39,120
tar to back up your system or our sync to the really big stuff that's scenario

715
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:42,720
based training where you get real hands-on go to Linux Academy.com slash

716
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,720
unplugged to get our discount and you can take the tour it's a really great

717
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,760
service and it's built by people that are crazy passionate about Linux I love

718
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:55,400
that about them and they're working so hard Linux Academy.com slash unplugged oh

719
00:50:55,400 --> 00:51:00,560
and they just rolled out a new dashboard hey fancy that yeah got a whole new look

720
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:04,400
check that out as well if you're already a member Linux Academy.com slash unplugged

721
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,000
and a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the unplugged program you

722
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,640
guys are awesome so I don't really know how to cover this next story in fact

723
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:17,760
it's so I'm dreading it so much that Wes and I were trying to figure out how to

724
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:22,280
handle this on the show because it's really not our area of expertise and

725
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:27,200
there is very valid points on all sides but some important things happen this

726
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,040
week I just want to touch on them and I want to keep the conversation as light

727
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:34,380
as possible but I also don't want to ignore it I think that would be and it's

728
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:41,240
one way sort of disrespectful so this week Matthew Garrett and another kernel

729
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:47,440
contributor her name is Sarah Sharp yes thank you both decided to step away from

730
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:54,240
the Linux kernel community in a sense and in both site essentially the tone

731
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:59,440
the language and the overall interacting with people on the Linux kernel mailing

732
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,360
list and mostly you could sum up as it's accused of being a toxic environment

733
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:10,400
and this keeps coming up as a theme over and over again and it may give us some

734
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,600
insight into some of the change that happened earlier this year perhaps when

735
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:18,960
it comes to the code of conduct that was submitted to the Linux kernel and I'm

736
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,640
trying to wrap my head around why we keep running into this and I simply I

737
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:30,600
simply wonder now this might sound maybe too simplistic but I definitely noticed

738
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,240
just on this road trip that I just went on and I think I was telling you about

739
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:38,080
this at lunch too like there is a difference in culture from Washington to

740
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:42,120
Grand Forks like everywhere I went each location people talked differently

741
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:45,120
different expectations they behaved differently like I was telling you about

742
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,480
the guy at the whiskey store who gave us the you know the the squinty eye then

743
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,440
you go to another town and it's like they're pouring you free drinks and if

744
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,540
they're embracing you get like everywhere has its own culture and its

745
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:58,680
own way of doing things and you take that and you blow it up on a global

746
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:02,120
scale and then we're all working together but then the other thing that

747
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:08,400
seems to be completely counter to a organic open environment is you have

748
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,800
people that are coming at it from the corporate standpoint where this is their

749
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:15,360
job and they're here to do a job and then you have people that are doing it

750
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:18,360
because it's their life's work and their life's passion and they're they would be

751
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:21,560
doing it whether they're getting paid or not and you have two completely

752
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:27,020
different types of work mindsets coming together to work on something and they

753
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:30,760
the two different groups completely behave differently not to mention a lot

754
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:34,040
of these people may have never met each other face-to-face right right and then

755
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:37,560
you have people that you know handle different types of language completely

756
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:41,160
differently trying to work together and I just look at this and think how is it

757
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:45,640
possible to have any project at this scale and not have this happen I'm not

758
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:51,520
trying to justify the actions but I'm wondering is it are we are we are we

759
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:56,000
capable at this stage of our ability to communicate online to really solve this

760
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,640
problem is online communications just still too primitive to truly solve this

761
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:05,840
problem could it be if Linus is it possible if if Linus just spoke a little

762
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:11,080
more nicely and treated new people with really you know with a really more

763
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:16,080
gentle touch would that really change things what do you think Wes does is it

764
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:21,040
possible you know you know I'm not sure and it's it's a it's it's tough to try

765
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:26,040
to draw the line between you know making improvements and versus different styles

766
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:29,720
you know I think Linus has touched on that on the mailing list before you know

767
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,360
different different people have different expectations and take things

768
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:36,040
different ways which is which is entirely valid but that said it does you

769
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:39,160
know it gives me pause that you know both of these people are clearly very

770
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:42,520
talented technically you know and they've contributed a lot to the kernel

771
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:46,800
and so it is yeah it's at least interesting that they choose to leave

772
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:49,800
obviously well we're lucky that we still get to enjoy what they do in other

773
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:53,760
open-source projects mm-hmm but as a Linux user I'd like to you know I'd

774
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,680
like to have an environment where people are excited to join and are not turned

775
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:00,760
away right yeah that is definitely you don't want to have a reputation for

776
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:04,640
being I'm a con did bring up in the chat room did bring up a good point though

777
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:08,760
there is the issue of you know do we want you know is this something where

778
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:12,200
you need to step away and and this is of course a personal choice but or should

779
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:15,720
there should there be a stand-up of people who want to change and represent

780
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:19,960
that change within the kernel community mmm I don't know if people just leave

781
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:22,880
them there's not representation right does that just leave the people you know

782
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:27,080
who are interacting in the style that a subset of people don't enjoy yeah this

783
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:31,240
is a tough this is a challenging one because it's it's it's unfortunately a

784
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:37,160
topic that it's really it's it's a bad it's a bad image to have it's a really

785
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:41,440
bad image to have right and it's really at the core of Linux anybody in the

786
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,920
mumble room have a thought on if this is problem is something we're at anywhere

787
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:48,160
close to solving because I feel like we're so far out from having an answer

788
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:54,840
here I think one of the first questions you asked was you alluded to the fact

789
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:59,960
that this keeps happening and that things aren't changing and there's a

790
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:05,760
good reason for that the same people work in that team you know if if you

791
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,520
don't change anything then nothing is going to change it is as simple as that

792
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:15,560
if and if the people who are at the top and who control the style of

793
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:19,880
communication that happens in that team and have other people looking up to them

794
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:25,000
and take guidance on how to act if those people don't change then nothing will

795
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,760
change and this will carry on and you'll be left with only those people who have

796
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:37,680
a very strong stomach and a very thick skin and who can cope with the kind of

797
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:43,800
beatings that that Linus gives out and you won't be able to have the other

798
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:48,920
talent from the people who don't have a thick skin and and aren't willing to put

799
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:53,360
up with that crap and so you're you're you're limiting the contributions that

800
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:57,520
you can possibly get not because of someone's technical ability but because

801
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:03,360
of their willingness to put up with the crap that they have to in that group

802
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:10,580
hmm I I just that so your argument which is a good one is sort of assumes the

803
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:14,520
foregone conclusion that something must change that the way it's being done now

804
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:19,760
is wrong and I don't necessarily disagree but I guess the thing I don't

805
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:25,600
like about that is that begins to walk a path that leads to Linus and I don't

806
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:30,100
really want there to be this sort of Linus must go sentiment-building because

807
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:34,680
that seems like that could be destructive but he's not a god he's he's

808
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:41,200
a guy who is an unpleasant person he is he said that himself yeah recent Linus

809
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:45,540
conference he said I'm not a nice person to deal with you know it that's a kind

810
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:51,000
of it's one of those phrases that people use that that people say oh well I tell

811
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:56,960
like it is and what I am and I know that's the way I am and I say what I

812
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:01,560
like and yeah you know that's that's it well okay that's fair enough but stay

813
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:05,480
the fuck away from me because you're not a pleasant person to be around I do

814
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:09,440
follow that logic why you have to be around these well and unfortunately some

815
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:14,360
of these people have to because it's their job I I just I the the only of

816
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:18,720
course the counter argument would be the very success of Linux itself right and

817
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:23,720
so I the when when the line of logic is that Linus is the problem then I say

818
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:28,360
well then what was everything we've accomplished so far how he has been not

819
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:32,160
necessarily the person developed it but you do have to wonder if we would really

820
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:36,520
have the world's best kernel right now if he wasn't extremely critical and I'm

821
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,800
not trying to justify I'm throwing that if that's a possibility it's sort of

822
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:44,400
like it's sort of like Apple is a nicer softer company without Steve Jobs but

823
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:49,000
they have also lost something without him correlation is not causation there

824
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:54,400
isn't you can't just say that because Linus wears glasses everyone who wears

825
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:58,440
glasses must be a really good kernel hacker you you can't necessarily say that

826
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:07,400
no no no no no since I've been wearing glasses that's what he's like and Linux

827
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:12,280
is has been successful doesn't mean it is successful because that's what he's

828
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:17,280
like right now I agree no I agree with you I agree with you I just I think it

829
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,400
is still is a dangerous line of thinking but it maybe it's I mean maybe it is

830
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:24,080
time I okay let's let's okay let's put it to you if you were in if you're

831
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:27,960
working in an office and someone was talking to you the way that Linus talked

832
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:33,640
to Sarah would you you know if you you would you just shrug that off if it

833
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:37,520
happened repeatedly and your your main line of work was to interact with that

834
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:42,400
person would you let that stand I put it to you that most people would probably

835
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:46,040
take that person to one side and say hey I think you're being unreasonable I

836
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:49,720
think you're you're acting like a dick I think you're the way you're acting in

837
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:54,120
front of our peers because this is public it's not like these two people are

838
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:58,200
sat in a room right and they have a tete-a-tete in the room this is like

839
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:02,800
wider than people sitting in a meeting room this is public on a mailing list

840
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:07,760
everyone is seeing him tearing strips off people that's unreasonable and in a

841
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:11,960
business place he would be reprimanded why the Linux Foundation not doing

842
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:16,360
something about this well I you know I've read the quotes I'm not I can't

843
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:21,600
really think of one that is particularly offensive people have gone through no I

844
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:23,840
mean people have gone through and collected the quotes that they believe

845
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:28,160
are in question here right but you're not on the receiving end of them no I'm

846
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,760
just saying they're not none of them are none of them are all that particularly

847
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:34,480
so the worst one I could find and I know this is just through my reading this

848
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:40,200
morning but the worst quote I found was something that implied sucking Microsoft

849
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:43,160
off that was thrown at Matthew Garrett wasn't thrown at Sarah was thrown at

850
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:47,720
Matthew Garrett that seems to be the worst I could find on the kernel mailing

851
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:55,640
list and it's okay that's crude but you know I don't know I I the the sometimes

852
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:58,520
from the outside the story looks a lot worse to be honest with you poppy to

853
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:01,120
answer your question I have worked environments where people yell and

854
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:06,840
scream like that and it's not wonderful it's not great but sometimes it just is

855
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:12,560
how those people work unfortunately and I don't like it but it's sort of it's

856
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:15,400
sort of posted everywhere when you walk in the door what happens I mean

857
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:19,760
everybody's not like it's a secret like you said all that stuff is in public so

858
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:26,200
right but in a place like that you can you know you can act and effect change

859
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:30,960
you know if whether whether you feel it's really unreasonable or not you know

860
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:34,040
the person who's the recipient that can effect some kind of change by

861
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:37,960
approaching management or approaching the other person's management or the HR

862
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:41,040
department or whatever the process is in that company there are processes is the

863
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:46,200
point yeah it's very difficult I mean they're already they already they

864
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:50,320
already have submitted the code of conduct then the new updated one that

865
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:54,440
Craig's image doesn't actually identify anything that you're not supposed to do

866
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:58,280
in any way but the problem is there's only one person at the top of this tree

867
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:02,080
and that's Linus you can't you can't say our screw this I'll go to that other

868
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:06,080
Linux down the road like you would quit a job and go to a different job mm-hmm

869
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:09,480
you know if your if your job is to contribute to Linux chances are if it's

870
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:13,680
if it's high enough up the up the food chain you're gonna interact with the

871
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:20,600
LKML at some point so it's it's it's difficult because there is only one yeah

872
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:25,200
there can only be one so heavens you wanted to jump in about Linus being

873
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:30,200
blunt and harsh what are your thoughts well he's been this way for quite a long

874
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:35,200
while and this problem hasn't popped up until recently mainly with her just

875
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:39,080
because everyone else can deal with it and she can maybe she should you step

876
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:42,800
down so she's not doing but doesn't that assume doesn't that assume that other

877
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:45,680
people that assumes that other people haven't burnt out and left and just

878
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:49,840
didn't say anything well possibly more engaged with other

879
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:54,200
communities yeah what was that wimpy also what didn't get started in the

880
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:59,120
first place right now go ahead BST go ahead heavens ideally of course would be

881
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:04,720
a slightly nicer place to be but the Linux kernel yes I do believe he should

882
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:10,840
be very blunt and straightforward to be really that's that's your solution if

883
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:14,560
you don't like it you should find another project clearly technical as

884
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:20,360
possible the problem that she was talking about in her blog post was not

885
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:27,020
about the fact that any technical mistakes that she made was insulting to

886
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:31,880
her she said that she wanted that if she made a technical mistake that she wanted

887
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:35,920
in the color color out on it and that she didn't have a problem with technical

888
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:39,880
insults it was the personal insults that they were thrown at her I don't know what

889
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:43,880
they were I couldn't I couldn't find any myself but the I didn't look that hard

890
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:50,880
but the the point is is that if if there are personal insults then what is the

891
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:54,360
net what is it necessary to actually insult the person who's providing the

892
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:58,280
code if they're genuinely trying to provide good code rather than saying

893
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:02,680
here's where you screwed up like this is garbage code here's how to fix it or

894
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:07,920
here's a new suggestion or something and when that happens they usually say okay

895
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:12,440
yeah you're right I'll take care of it but if it goes to a personal level why

896
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:17,080
would you be too busy for a person one he's also wanting to retire you know

897
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:21,280
you're you're so setting associating this to Linus it's not necessary yeah I

898
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,840
guess a lot of the maintainer other maintainers are where so that's a good

899
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:27,280
point right she was she was talking about the community as a whole she did

900
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:33,600
not specify Linus or anyone at all right right and I think I think that kind of

901
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:37,080
when it obviously when it crosses line into personal that's where it gets

902
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:40,320
unfortunate and it should that there's no excuse for that really that's just

903
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:44,000
being mean it's just that is straight up just being mean North Ranger I wanted

904
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,480
to give you a chance to jump in yeah I mean rotten corpse makes a great point

905
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:53,680
about you know when you cross that line into a personal insult and I'm kind of

906
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:57,560
torn because I want to see you know people like Sarah people like Matthew if

907
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:02,640
they are being personally insulted to you know to call out those bulliers but

908
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:06,800
on the flip side I don't know that they can do that because of you know

909
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:11,160
potential backlash they might have for for being tattletales or whatever you

910
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:15,760
might want to call it it just I guess going back to the core point it

911
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:20,560
frustrates me because here we are in episode 113 I feel like every two months

912
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:24,320
we have a story where maybe it's not that frequent but it feels like we've

913
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:28,920
done plenty of these stories about people getting hurt upset and it seems

914
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:35,400
like this just keeps keeps happening in the blog post Sarah did say that things

915
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:38,920
are changing and things are right improvements she just doesn't want to

916
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:42,200
deal with it having to be involved with it anymore regardless of that there is

917
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:46,880
being there are changes being made she just doesn't want to be there in the in

918
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:52,160
the midst of them change I think it's I think it's fair to to say that it's very

919
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:55,800
unfortunate if this is something that singles out and happens to women but we

920
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:59,240
have seen it happen we've seen it happen to blonde white men I mean supposedly

921
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:05,000
Lenart Pottering had his life threatened over system D so this has been an issue

922
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:11,440
where it just goes too far over and over and over again and passionate community

923
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:15,080
yeah I just I don't I mean I don't I don't know quite how to make reason out

924
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:19,600
of it it doesn't it does seem to be a problem that doesn't just be unique to

925
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,360
Linux kernel mailing list either although I think you could make an

926
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:26,280
argument that's an area where perhaps conduct needs to be above bar as much

927
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:29,200
as possible because it's under so much scrutiny and it represents as a core

928
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:33,720
part of its business critical now you know yeah it's yeah yeah there's and as

929
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:38,400
I said there's only one but the business critical thing actually adds more

930
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:43,720
importance to making sure everything is right yeah yes I think the idea that the

931
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:49,000
the way that they handle the technical aspects of it is perfectly fine and even

932
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,920
if they're yelling at each other and because if someone does something that

933
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:56,600
is worthy of being yelled at they should be yelled at because that's the only

934
01:06:56,600 --> 01:07:00,640
thing that's effective in a even though they're people being paid for and it's

935
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:04,040
their job they aren't being paid by the Linux

936
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:07,640
foundation for most I think it's worth making the distinction to that what some

937
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:10,120
people consider being yelled at other people do not consider yelling too

938
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:13,200
because there are cultural differences and there's very large cultural

939
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:18,360
differences in some cases right and the main thing is though like these people

940
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:21,960
are saying like you know they're being paid to work on it so they don't have a

941
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:28,440
choice but the people who are yelling at them aren't paying them so how can they

942
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:34,640
you know convey the message of how the severity of their mistake when they have

943
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:39,040
no actual control except for this is not coming in like that's all they can do

944
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:44,880
though like here they if they maybe you know in certain cases be severe or not

945
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:51,760
it depends on if the technical aspect of it isn't merit or not so as in my

946
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:55,200
opinion if the technical thing happens and you get yelled at because the code

947
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:58,880
is terrible well then the code is terrible whatever fix it so here's the

948
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:03,680
as long as it doesn't go personal as Noah would say here's the thing and this

949
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:07,600
is sort of my big takeaway is if you have something that's open and you want

950
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:11,320
contributions and you want quality contributions it's probably worth the

951
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:15,480
project's time and effort to make contributions feel or make contributors

952
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:19,360
feel as welcome and invited as possible because that only is going to make your

953
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:24,840
project better and so I think it is in the best interest of open source

954
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:28,960
projects health to have a good community and part of that is how you interact

955
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:32,360
with that community so now the Linux kernel isn't really suffering from this

956
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:35,440
particular problem they can afford to be rather aggressive but there are a lot of

957
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:38,920
projects out there so many of which we have talked about today that could use

958
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:44,080
contributions and for them it's in their best interest to work with the community

959
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:47,800
now what I would hate to see is a bunch of middle management PMO types come in

960
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:50,840
and try to tell all these projects how to work with their community but that is

961
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:55,760
a topic for a future show if anybody has any closing thoughts I'll hear it but

962
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:59,480
I'll go ahead run well you'll I'll give you the closing word yeah I just wanted

963
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:03,960
to play devil's advocate here in the sense of like the way you just said

964
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:08,520
about how that they need to you know be more opening to people but there are

965
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:12,600
certain cases where there's some people that you you don't want to submit code

966
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:16,680
to because it takes more time to weed through their code to see if it's

967
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:19,680
actually useful or not that there have been people who have been banned from

968
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:23,400
the mailing list because they were submitting code that was complete

969
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:27,400
garbage yeah just so that they could get their own for a couple reasons they

970
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:30,960
could get their name in the kernel or certain things like that and in certain

971
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:35,720
cases they were like actively breaking you know user land and everything and

972
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:41,560
right like a cardinal sin of a colonel so they were basically doing like they

973
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:49,120
have to set an environment that is a weird hybrid of community and hostility

974
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:56,480
so it's you know how can you really I mean it's it's a situation where I don't

975
01:09:56,480 --> 01:10:00,480
think anyone could really you know find iron it out it's gonna be hard to find

976
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:03,720
the balance that's what I say is it's just gonna be an ongoing problem too but

977
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:06,880
I do hope it tends towards making people feel more welcome and getting more

978
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:10,520
contributors because that's gonna make the projects better and get new ideas in

979
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:14,280
there too so why don't we kind of end it on a positive note right there episode

980
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:18,120

here next week.

995
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:38,120
if I'm being honest my my strong desire was actually to just reload my machine

996
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:41,520
with the latest Androgros ISO I already had written to a to a USB thumb drive

997
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:47,480
like new install I'm like no no I can recover it I can rebuild it I can make

998
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:51,240
it stronger and better than before I've seen some people on the arch forums who

999
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:54,480
just have it set up every night they just reinstall yeah well you know you

1000
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:57,920
just pull them especially if you already have like maybe you cash the packages

1001
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:02,480
locally you know you have a some you know chef for ansible and just build it

1002
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:05,680
all up again it's ready to go in the morning Androgros is good I'm telling

1003
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:10,080
you I'm loving the latest Androgros build loving their installer option for

1004
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:13,240
long-term kernel support is brilliant when you're doing a desktop arch machine

1005
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:17,600
and one checkbox steam installation you know it's also my default for installing

1006
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:21,440
arch now I don't I don't use their installer but it's such a nice live CD

1007
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:25,800
to boot into and then you just install arch in a shrew every now and then every

1008
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:29,400
now and then I swear I get like a bad ISO or something and the installers just

1009
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:34,440
totally wonky but I either then I just jump either between the daily build or

1010
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:37,920
the latest stable release and whichever one fails me I just switch switching

1011
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:42,440
one of those gonna work yeah and I have to say I just recently reloaded a

1012
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:46,120
machine that we had set aside for Windows 10 testing that I was like no

1013
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:51,640
more gone with you and I just was like I'm gonna do Androgros again and I got

1014
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:57,160
their latest their latest build and the fact is is this machine now that I think

1015
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:59,680
about it I'm giving it to somebody that's gonna be using it that won't be

1016
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:03,840
doing updates very often and having that LTS kernel I feel a lot better about

1017
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:06,460
giving them an arch system all of a sudden even though for me I don't do it

1018
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:09,640
right right but for someone in a different a little different use case

1019
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:13,440
yeah that's a little more peace of mind installing and and of course anybody

1020
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:17,320
installing arch could do that but for some reason when I was setting up this

1021
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:20,280
machine for them it didn't cross my mind I tell you if I had done the arch

1022
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:23,960
installation myself yeah I probably would have just neglected to think of

1023
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:28,240
that yep so I was pretty appreciative of that just had the option as the default

1024
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:31,880
or it really makes arch super approachable yeah you don't have to have

1025
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:35,200
you know carefully designed your system for a day beforehand you can just

1026
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:39,360
install it and yeah away you go yeah and the default the default gnome desktop is

1027
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:42,280
the one I generally go with is pretty nice I change it up pretty quickly but

1028
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:50,000
it's easy enough to do that yeah so yes in fact I think probably the only time

1029
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:55,280
I'll ever install arch vanilla straight a standard old arch is on a server right

1030
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:59,120
if I'm for some reason deciding that server should be running arch mm-hmm but

1031
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:03,320
I don't know how much I'm gonna do that I'm on the fence on that still I do it

1032
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:08,240
for a for a few machines that I use daily but anything beyond that I wouldn't

1033
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:12,560
depends on how willing you are and how much time you have and so I think it

1034
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:17,520
also depends on what's the server doing right exactly so is the server is a

1035
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:22,160
server hosting web pages over nginx and a pad or Apache and and it has a

1036
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:27,200
database or is it a Plex machine with Dropbox and BitTorrent sync yes exactly

1037
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:32,120
and I'm more inclined to say Ubuntu is a good is a good solution or CentOS is a

1038
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:36,800
good solution for the first one yes and arch is a better solution for the Plex

1039
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:42,240
media server type thing because then you have the AUR and you could just right

1040
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:45,520
off the top of my head I mean the advantage there is in the AUR you've got

1041
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:49,560
the Plex and the Plex pass version yep you can also get like the git versions

1042
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:52,360
or whatever like the beta builds and stuff the nightly's or whatever you need

1043
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:58,880
yeah and so it's a very minimal update and if you so we have two servers the

1044
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:04,040
run arch that hosts Plex one here at the studio and one at my house nice and both

1045
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:08,240
of them are just really minimal installs with Plex and a couple other things yep

1046
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:12,320
and then it just keeps the updates fairly small and so I think now we're at

1047
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:15,520
like two to three months in between updates but it really hasn't been an

1048
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:19,120
issue yet yes you know that's what I've been doing for the one that runs MB at

1049
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:23,560
my house and and there are ways to you know you can you can update frequently

1050
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:27,320
if you need to or you can take snapshots if you know Sousa style if you're

1051
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:31,820
worried about you know if you need it to be a little more productiony and you

1052
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:35,920
know ever the the evergreen releases from open Sousa are a good LTS but I

1053
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:38,760
think maybe for me the the leap stuff might be even better hey so what do you

1054
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:41,760
think about this user in the chairman says how do you manage your dot files and

1055
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:44,760
integral so I'm looking for the best way to do it and when he says manage I'm

1056
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:48,080
thinking maybe keeping them consistent across his machines is that what you

1057
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:52,080
think he's talking about when he says manage yeah you know yeah it could be

1058
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:57,280
consistent it could be versioned it could be backed up so I used to try it

1059
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:01,240
I used to try to do this over Dropbox and that burned me so bad that I never

1060
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:04,560
bothered again and actually what it what the way it kind of burned me was is one

1061
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,680
machine got updated to a new version of KDE and then the other machine stuff

1062
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:09,880
synced over and it was just a mess and it's like of course that was gonna

1063
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:13,680
happen to me I was just kind of trying it and that didn't go well have you ever

1064
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:17,080
used anything West to like get or anything like that to keep your yeah you

1065
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:20,320
know and it depends again like so many things on how involved you want to be

1066
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:23,240
how often you need to touch it how you know like magically behind the scenes it

1067
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:29,280
works yeah but yes I have mine I use a good new stow to create sim links for my

1068
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:34,560
configuration files in both Etsy and my files the new stow yeah on now hold on

1069
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:37,320
now hold on that sounds app pick material I gotta take a look tell me

1070
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:42,000
about good news still I just got a sim link manager GNU oh okay

1071
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:50,480
STO okay and I'm slightly I learned to use it for a particular project several

1072
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:54,400
years ago that's why it's on my toolkit okay but it lets you set up it lets you

1073
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:58,600
easily set up sort of sort of like you would see inside of like an RPM package

1074
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:02,000
where you have a tree that gets mirrored out to the real file system and so it

1075
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,680
makes it really easy to keep your configuration files okay you know so

1076
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:08,440
usually when I set things up or if I'm converting a server you can just move a

1077
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:12,000
file to your to your storage location and then in stow will automatically if

1078
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,180
you set it up create a sim link so you can edit your files just like they

1079
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:19,680
actually lived in Etsy yeah but they can all be under one folder yeah and then

1080
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:22,600
that way whenever you have changes you know you can make a new branch on get

1081
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:27,160
you and then you're backing up that one folder yes exactly so that's just a git

1082
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:31,200
repo and you're sinking out across your machines yeah well and then and then

1083
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:33,640
that's you can have you know you can have different branches if you have you

1084
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:36,280
know different configuration files that need to be in a different syntax that's

1085
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:38,680
sounding to get a little complicated though yeah and so it depends you know

1086
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:41,920
most of my machines are similar enough that I can just sync them you know I

1087
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:45,360
can just pull down the repo you could have a easy little script that would

1088
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:49,640
keep it in sync if you'd like who it really depends on how you know how

1089
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:54,240
different your configurations need to be yeah per machine so user links in the

1090
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:59,880
chat room an actual specific how-to on how to use stow to kind of do exactly

1091
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:02,880
what we're talking about how to manage your dot files so I will throw a link to

1092
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:06,560
that in the show notes so here it is using the new stow to manage your dot

1093
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:10,360
files this might be exactly what you know and this will work well if your

1094
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:14,880
idea of a file manager is the terminal so it's not for everyone but yeah yeah

1095
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:19,440
I've had some good use use cases I like that it seems to me like kind of an

1096
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:23,400
intermediate step you're not ready to go full ansible or chef you know what's

1097
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:27,160
funny about that statement though is the the command line I laugh at the command

1098
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:29,880
line being my file manager until I really need to get something done or I

1099
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:33,000
don't have any damn time to fool around and then all of a sudden but you damn

1100
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,280
right the command line is my file manager that's all I'll you move is move

1101
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:40,440
and it will always work and LS responds immediately I don't have to wait for

1102
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:45,080
Nautilus to enumerate icons or whatever no preview files no I just want the file

1103
01:18:45,080 --> 01:19:02,280
list I want to know who owns this file right now
