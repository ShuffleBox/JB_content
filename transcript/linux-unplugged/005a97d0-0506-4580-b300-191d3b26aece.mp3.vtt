WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.720
Before we get started I got to give props to mr. Popey who pointed me out to this pretty sweet deal

00:06.600 --> 00:10.560
Over by googs. You can get two gigabytes of additional Google Drive storage

00:10.560 --> 00:15.800
If you just do a security audit check up on your Google account really seems like kind of a good idea anyways, right?

00:15.800 --> 00:18.600
Well, yeah, I mean pay me to do something. I should be doing anyhow. Yeah

00:19.120 --> 00:23.200
Yeah, you know you're not okay to call it the googs anymore, right? We got in trouble didn't we? Yeah, we did

00:23.200 --> 00:30.420
I gotta hear the story. There's just people are complaining as usual people don't like

00:30.640 --> 00:36.920
Yeah, people complain about system D. But we like that. So no, I guess googs is actually like a slam term in some areas

00:37.120 --> 00:42.720
Like oh, oh, it's a cultural thing. Okay. Yeah. I'm I know that see I got googs. I didn't know Google

00:42.720 --> 00:44.560
Yeah, I didn't know that either

00:44.560 --> 00:49.920
Googs is actually kind of an endearing term. And meanwhile, no, they're saying googs. He's a guy who walks around wearing Google Glass. Yeah

00:49.920 --> 00:55.440
Well, a good comparison is if you walk into a house in the 70s in the US and you say wow look at that shag

00:55.440 --> 00:59.920
You're talking about carpet you do that in the UK. I'm pretty sure you're talking about two people doing the monkey

01:00.520 --> 01:04.920
So, you know, I mean it's it's cultural. It's cultural. You could call it Google

01:07.640 --> 01:11.660
It's like it's like if Google and I were like lovers

01:12.280 --> 01:15.220
Like oh googs like that. We might know what my love nickname

01:15.220 --> 01:20.260
Boy, there's there's really here's the thing Chris because I always have to start stories with here's the thing

01:22.060 --> 01:27.460
The thing is I don't ever call anything by its actual name. I don't call Walmart Walmart. I call it Wally world

01:27.460 --> 01:32.460
I don't call Google Google. I call it gooks. I mean I have abbreviated names for everything. It's an opportunity for fun

01:32.780 --> 01:38.240
But I might they might be confusing it with that word. I do the same thing. I call mate a mate

01:38.580 --> 01:40.580
And Tara gross and I don't know

01:40.580 --> 01:46.360
To it's to two distinct syllables. It's supposed to be my tape. Yeah, right, right

01:46.700 --> 01:48.940
Mate pay attention to feedback Chris. Yeah, I know

01:51.140 --> 01:57.580
Once again, I can't help but point out that all of you will say something wrong at some point

01:57.580 --> 02:01.020
And so long as you get the message across it doesn't really matter how you say

02:01.020 --> 02:08.540
Oh, that was so beautiful. I know it actually made me feel better about myself

02:12.540 --> 02:18.580
Welcome to the Linux Unplugged show or a weekly Linux talk show. That's definitely stuck in the Pacific Northwest rain

02:19.100 --> 02:21.760
My name is Chris. Hey, my name is soggy

02:23.500 --> 02:28.740
Right, I I was really nice my wife and kids stopped by a few minutes before the show started and

02:28.740 --> 02:32.700
You know, that's that's a nice treat when they show up in the middle of the day

02:32.700 --> 02:37.100
One of the benefits of working for yourself, I suppose but you know what wasn't so nice

02:37.940 --> 02:41.460
What's that? You know, I go out there to be you know, just say goodbye and you know, sure

02:41.460 --> 02:43.860
you know get everybody else situated buckle in the kids and

02:44.380 --> 02:49.260
I wore my jacket and in that time I got rain and it's a pretty heavy jacket

02:49.260 --> 02:55.180
I got rain through my jacket and the shirt underneath I'm wearing got totally soaked. So I'm standing here. Oh wearing wet clothes

02:55.180 --> 03:02.340
Man, you know, they they that's funny. They have these things on sticks that apparently project the rain around you

03:02.340 --> 03:04.340
I think they're called umbrellas

03:04.660 --> 03:08.100
And living in Washington, I'm just you know, I should have stock

03:08.580 --> 03:14.180
Well, it's it's manly in in this day and age to have an umbrella. It's no longer like a city we could do that now

03:14.220 --> 03:16.860
Okay. Yeah, it's totally okay black umbrella. You're fine

03:18.140 --> 03:21.780
Well Matt we have a great show today umbrella notwithstanding

03:21.780 --> 03:29.500
Later on in today's show after we get through the feedback. We're gonna talk about Ubuntu phone. It's here. It's real starting next week

03:29.500 --> 03:32.340
You'll be able to pre-order yourself a BQ phone run Ubuntu touch

03:32.380 --> 03:36.780
We'll give you more details about that what the pricing is gonna be what the software situation looks like right now

03:37.020 --> 03:40.700
We're gonna pick up Opie's ear on the launch event. They had an insiders event

03:40.700 --> 03:45.300
I don't know what the heck that means, but I know people got their hands on special units. That also sounds very interesting

03:45.300 --> 03:51.140
That in the show and then we're gonna really do a deep dive on this because normally we would

03:51.500 --> 03:56.500
Cover a lot of this in the Linux action show on Sunday, but Linux action show this week was pre-recorded

03:56.500 --> 03:58.860
So we didn't get a chance to fit this in so there's so much to talk about

03:59.140 --> 04:05.420
So we're gonna we're gonna go in deep on that this week. But first gotta talk a little about own cloud 8.0 just came out and

04:06.860 --> 04:12.380
I wanted to kind of noodle around with the mumble room see who's in the mumble room using the own cloud

04:12.380 --> 04:15.700
So let's bring them in time appropriate greens mumble room. Hey guys

04:18.580 --> 04:23.020
Oh, so we got a great note in the subreddit from seal 20 and

04:23.860 --> 04:25.420
He's talking about kids from a rose

04:25.420 --> 04:29.900
I was wondering how many people use own cloud in the last community and for what with the release of 8

04:29.900 --> 04:33.340
I thought it'd be nice to ask the community. I'll start by describing my use case

04:33.340 --> 04:37.300
He's got it on a cent OS 6 VPS own cloud 7 soon to be version 8

04:37.300 --> 04:43.420
He uses that obviously the core own cloud components the contacts the gallery the documents the tasks news music chat

04:43.820 --> 04:49.520
Calendar all that stuff. He's got six users on it. He's using mobile apps using cal dev and car dev and own cloud sync

04:50.300 --> 04:54.540
Completely he's using as a complete replacement for Dropbox almost a replacement for Google

04:54.540 --> 04:57.380
He shares photos with it shares files that are too big for email

04:58.100 --> 05:01.260
Isn't currently using encryption has about 300 gigs in own cloud

05:01.260 --> 05:07.240
Anybody in the mumble room currently experimenting with own cloud maybe done the upgrade own cloud 8 by chance

05:07.240 --> 05:11.480
I have fun cloud now, which you know, is it so I use it. Yeah, I'm still using 7

05:11.480 --> 05:16.040
No, what are you using on cloud for now? I yeah. Well, I started unbeknownst to me

05:16.720 --> 05:21.200
You're not supposed to put all of your data into own cloud. It's not it's not quite there yet

05:21.200 --> 05:26.440
Oh, so somebody forgot to tell me that and so I put every last bit of it

05:26.440 --> 05:30.920
I tried it for a couple of weeks first on my laptop and everything worked out great

05:30.920 --> 05:36.760
So I moved all of my data that I carry my laptop on a daily basis to own cloud and for the first couple of months

05:36.760 --> 05:40.480
I thought I thought things were dandy every time I'd restore my laptop, which is you know

05:40.480 --> 05:42.520
Once every three weeks or switch laptops

05:42.520 --> 05:47.540
I would I just sign into own cloud and all my files would show up and then one day I went to look for a

05:47.540 --> 05:48.520
File and it wasn't there

05:48.520 --> 05:54.880
And so I started doing I started doing comparisons of the backup side made of my laptops and realized that over time

05:54.880 --> 06:01.080
I had just been slowly losing files. No, and then what well, yeah, and then I brought it up to everyone thinking that everyone

06:01.280 --> 06:06.820
Would have a solution and everyone's answer was yeah, you know that that that happens with a lot sometimes no

06:08.680 --> 06:10.680
Well, so

06:10.760 --> 06:13.220
I'm kind of out on cloud for the time being well, yeah

06:13.640 --> 06:18.960
Yeah, I've noticed a lot of people online say I use own club, but I don't use the sync feature

06:18.960 --> 06:24.860
And and then I think that's kind of how I use it. I do use own cloud sync

06:24.920 --> 06:29.180
But I only use own cloud sync for a director that holds maybe 200 text files

06:29.360 --> 06:33.500
That's about all I think and a few pictures things like that that I'm using for in production stuff

06:33.500 --> 06:36.040
And then when it gets to heavy lifting for sinking

06:36.720 --> 06:42.400
That's when I go bit torrent sync and I use a dedicated sync system to handle a lot of file sinking

06:42.400 --> 06:47.680
I have to had issues with own cloud more in like I get all in and then I start hitting performance issues

06:47.680 --> 06:50.040
Haven't had that as much with the later versions

06:50.520 --> 06:54.300
So I've been bit a little bit by own cloud too. So I am a little trepidatious

06:54.300 --> 06:58.060
What I use own cloud for today is card dav and cal dav sinking. I

06:58.660 --> 07:03.260
Use it for minimal file stuff. Like for example, we have our assets for our shows

07:04.340 --> 07:07.800
women's tech radio or how to Linux or Linux unplug that there's you know

07:07.820 --> 07:13.240
You have PNG is of the logos and you have whatever the designers sent you the file and all this stuff that we need to share

07:13.240 --> 07:15.240
Amongst people own clouds great for that

07:15.240 --> 07:20.680
Outside of that I have ran into a few issues that have made me go kind of slow

07:20.920 --> 07:26.580
And another one that we got in this kind of along the same thing is a 19 caster in the subreddit

07:27.080 --> 07:30.120
And big bold letter says read the documentation

07:31.000 --> 07:36.600
Before you upgrade to own cloud 8 because if you just do a pseudo app just upgrade it could break your own cloud install

07:37.400 --> 07:39.360
So there you gave some links what you need to read

07:39.360 --> 07:41.380
So if you if you are upgrading to own cloud 8 soon

07:41.380 --> 07:45.020
I checked it out. Anyone else in the mumble room want to share their own cloud story

07:45.580 --> 07:48.260
Yeah, I've really never had a problem with own cloud

07:48.580 --> 07:53.880
I'm running on cloud 7 on open VSD and it's a manual install of own cloud

07:53.880 --> 07:56.500
Not a not a distro install or anything like that

07:56.500 --> 08:00.940
And honestly, I use it for syncing my files and I've never had a problem in this

08:01.460 --> 08:03.620
Quite a few of us that use it that sync across

08:04.140 --> 08:09.580
own cloud different files different folders all that sort of stuff and and I haven't noticed any any

08:09.580 --> 08:15.300
File drops or anything like that and and performance wise it's been spot-on. So no problems here

08:15.300 --> 08:18.680
No, do you remember what version of own cloud it was where you had data loss?

08:20.140 --> 08:23.100
And I'm wondering if it was like if it was like seven seven

08:23.100 --> 08:26.220
Oh, oh, I was gonna say like if it was like version six or five

08:26.220 --> 08:28.300
I think that's when they initially introduced file sync

08:28.300 --> 08:30.820
My question is to the gentleman that was just speaking

08:30.820 --> 08:34.380
Did you have you do you have any files that are over like six or seven gigs?

08:34.380 --> 08:36.380
And have you noticed any problems with those?

08:36.380 --> 08:43.820
No, I don't true. I don't try to push that that size file in Australia. We our uplinks are absolutely pathetic

08:43.820 --> 08:47.620
So we we sort of don't push big files, but I mean, you know

08:47.620 --> 08:54.940
I've got a couple hundred Meg files and the checksums are still still spot-on on those. You know, they're ISOs. So

08:56.340 --> 09:03.260
Yeah from from my point of view. I don't move gigs, but that could be a PHP limitation where you've got a configuration issue

09:03.260 --> 09:11.580
Post yeah, that is that is something people that are running on cloud installs often run into is like settings in their PHP config

09:11.580 --> 09:15.900
That prevent file size or timeout issues and things like that is a is a common issue

09:16.420 --> 09:18.760
And the guys talk about that they do address that

09:19.460 --> 09:25.500
Yeah, I'm running it on nginx with PHP FPM. So that's the only difference. I bet that's it

09:25.500 --> 09:27.500
Well, I bet that's a pretty good setup though

09:27.500 --> 09:33.860
Oh, yeah from a performance point of view. It's stable. It doesn't use system too much system resources

09:33.860 --> 09:35.860
It's actually only running on a on a

09:36.660 --> 09:38.660
VPS of you know a 512

09:39.700 --> 09:46.080
Meg of RAM and you know, 20 20 or 20 or 30 something something only you use or do you have multiple users?

09:46.700 --> 09:48.700
Now multiple users

09:49.020 --> 09:50.420
Very nice. Well, I'm glad to get this

09:50.420 --> 09:52.020
So we got it. We got a little mixed input mine

09:52.020 --> 09:55.780
Mine has been somewhere in between what Noah's experienced, but I have had some issues

09:55.780 --> 09:59.420
So just take it easy and start what I do is whenever it comes to data like this

09:59.420 --> 10:03.380
I start slow, you know, and and I'm sure Matt would tell you to have a backup

10:04.060 --> 10:09.780
Always backups for your backups. Yeah, and are you still are you still primarily using bit torrent sync matter?

10:09.780 --> 10:11.260
Are you kind of now?

10:11.260 --> 10:15.480
Are you been able to get off the box sauce because I'm having no getting fully off the Dropbox sauce still

10:15.480 --> 10:20.620
I tend to use Dropbox for more of a I won't say backup because that would be entirely accurate

10:20.620 --> 10:24.740
But for more long-term sending things back and forth as far as like over the web

10:24.740 --> 10:29.100
But as far as like just on the land bit torrent sync is definitely what I do

10:29.100 --> 10:32.620
It just makes sense because it's easy if something breaks, it's stupid easy to fix

10:33.500 --> 10:35.540
You know, I just haven't had any problems with it

10:35.540 --> 10:39.460
And I'm gonna give a obligatory plug for sync thing because we always get in trouble. We don't mention sync thing

10:41.100 --> 10:47.140
Yeah, I I happen to like bit torrent sync a lot because I publicly share keys with folks and we sync over the internet

10:47.140 --> 10:51.620
But if you if you don't have that requirement and you're like doing LAN thinking or syncing even not over land

10:51.620 --> 10:54.000
But just a few machines sync thing is a very viable option

10:54.000 --> 10:59.440
Yeah, I like bit torrent sync, especially when it comes to large files. Yeah, it doesn't give me grief

10:59.440 --> 11:03.080
I don't have to worry about it. It just works and I can walk away and go have coffee. It doesn't matter. Yeah

11:03.520 --> 11:07.560
Easy. Hey, you know one way you can make all of this work is with a digital ocean droplet

11:07.560 --> 11:10.080
Whether it's own cloud or bit torrent sync or even sync thing

11:10.360 --> 11:13.980
Digital ocean would be a great place to host that head over to digital ocean comm right now

11:13.980 --> 11:18.900
In fact right after this one of our next emails is somebody's hosting something really really really cool on digital ocean

11:18.900 --> 11:22.180
And again, it gave me a great idea of something I might try but I'll show that to you in a second

11:22.180 --> 11:27.300
Uh digital ocean though. It's it's a it's a perfect opportunity for you to play with something like this or put it in a full

11:27.300 --> 11:32.580
Production like we do here at Jupiter broadcasting. That's the great thing about digital ocean because of the value that they have you can go

11:33.420 --> 11:39.660
You can easily easily justify going over there and and setting up a machine purely purely for educational reasons, right?

11:39.660 --> 11:44.100
But because these are all SSD power because they have tier one bandwidth because it's Linux and KVM

11:44.160 --> 11:50.300
You could also put in a full-scale production like we do and like my co-host on quota radio does for his clients

11:50.300 --> 11:54.900
He puts their client back in app stuff on digital ocean and you can transfer those images around

11:54.900 --> 12:00.440
It's great because digital ocean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way for you to get started

12:00.980 --> 12:02.540
Go over there in less than a minute

12:02.540 --> 12:06.600
You'll have your own cloud server spun up and pricing plans start only five dollars per month for

12:06.700 --> 12:12.060
512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one CPU and a terabyte of frickin transfer. That's amazing

12:12.060 --> 12:16.500
And they have data center locations in New York San Francisco Singapore Amsterdam in London

12:16.500 --> 12:20.900
So you can get that deal that geo diversity go out there and set up your own CDN or

12:21.620 --> 12:24.860
Quite honestly one of the things I use that for and it's a small thing

12:24.860 --> 12:31.380
but it to me it's like it's a nice thing I can do for the unfiltered audience without much cost because it's just five dollars is

12:31.380 --> 12:33.380
I have a

12:33.820 --> 12:38.540
Droplet in New York and I have a droplet in San Francisco and I have a droplet in Washington

12:38.540 --> 12:44.180
All right, I'm sorry. I have a server in Washington and all three of them act as like a three-way CDN

12:44.180 --> 12:49.020
so if you are in on the East Coast you can pull from my East Coast server much faster than you're gonna pull from my

12:49.020 --> 12:54.620
West Coast server and if you're across the pond you can pull from all three locations at the same time and all of them come

12:54.620 --> 12:58.300
From different routes. So it's it's a really cool way that I did like a cheap

12:59.060 --> 13:04.420
Really kind of overnight bit torrent sync CDN and it's is a perfect probably not but man

13:04.420 --> 13:07.260
Does it do the job for five dollars a month plus?

13:07.260 --> 13:12.820
I've got other stuff running on that rig and I'm always setting up new droplets because it's so quick to get started that interface

13:12.820 --> 13:15.140
It's like it's no it's no barrier at all

13:15.140 --> 13:20.420
I can just sit down and get working because the control panel is so crazy intuitive and you can replicate the control panel on a

13:20.420 --> 13:23.380
Larger scale with their API so that way if you end up getting a lot of droplets

13:23.500 --> 13:29.200
You can scale the management of those droplets using that API taking advantage of tools already created by the community or ones you create

13:29.200 --> 13:33.700
Yourself if you got the skills plus they've got great tutorials to help you get anything set up you need

13:33.700 --> 13:37.180
This is really a great combination. They're taking Linux, right? They're taking SSDs

13:37.180 --> 13:41.620
They're taking all this tier one bandwidth in these connections that they've managed to get in these great data centers

13:41.620 --> 13:44.380
and they've brought all of it together with incredible customer service a

13:45.500 --> 13:51.020
Expanding community that means great apps great tutorials incredible value backed by Linux

Go all in a big boy

14:18.700 --> 14:19.940
Absolutely, you know something here

14:19.940 --> 14:25.360
I did recently as I was working with a client and they were looking at setting up something with Moodle and that's like

14:25.360 --> 14:28.760
Oh, well, you know I can set Moodle up and when I was googling around sure enough. They had a

14:29.260 --> 14:31.260
digital ocean tutorial

14:31.380 --> 14:36.440
Very very awesome and it was cool because I could go through with this client actually show them how it was being set up and what

14:36.440 --> 14:38.360
All these things meant and all that sort of stuff. That's very awesome

14:38.360 --> 14:40.980
Yeah, you know and that is a nice piece of mind for them, too

14:40.980 --> 14:45.160
Is I'm gonna set this up on a digital ocean droplet right you and I ever part ways

14:45.320 --> 14:49.020
You're not high and dry. They've got all of this information for you and you can yeah

14:49.020 --> 14:51.780
That is slick and you know more and more when I'm searching for stuff

14:51.780 --> 14:56.060
I'm seeing the digital ocean tutorial show up in the search results because they're just they're just great

14:56.700 --> 15:00.900
So David my favorite. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. No, that's to say my favorite part was where they're like, oh, hey

15:00.900 --> 15:05.700
That's great. But you have control over it because it's on your droplet and like ah, but I don't and I clicked a few buttons

15:05.700 --> 15:11.460
It's yours. Yeah, it's your droplet. Yep. So David set up something kind of cool on one of his droplets

15:11.460 --> 15:14.340
He says I'm a longtime fan of less and I want to tell you about a project

15:14.340 --> 15:18.400
I have been working on it's a website called distro Plaza running at

15:19.020 --> 15:24.340
Www.distroplaza.com you guys can go check it out while I talk about it if you want and it lets anyone upload a torrent of any

15:24.420 --> 15:25.720
distribution for free

15:25.720 --> 15:30.900
Every distro upload it gets a download page a forum a blog and a place for users to review the distro

15:30.900 --> 15:36.180
Distributions also get user groups where they can use where you just can stay informed about what's going on with their favorite distro

15:36.380 --> 15:40.740
Distro Plaza launched in January on digital ocean. Thanks to the awesome promo code JB provides

15:40.740 --> 15:43.060
I would love to hear some feedback on distro Plaza

15:43.060 --> 15:46.580
And if you think any other features that would be good for distro Plaza, I'd love to know you can check it out

15:46.580 --> 15:48.460
distro plaza.com

15:48.460 --> 15:51.900
And so we're looking at it right here. And so the idea is you have a you know

15:51.900 --> 15:54.660
You have a distro you love a lot you upload the torrent

15:55.060 --> 16:00.260
So now they're seeding the torrent here or part of that they give you the forms. Here's the official Ubuntu forms

16:00.260 --> 16:04.540
Here's their forms for it. Here's blogs. It would be specifically around Ubuntu. It's empty

16:04.540 --> 16:07.660
I mean it needs content. And the other thing is I think it needs content from outside sources

16:07.660 --> 16:11.900
I don't think you can depend on self-generated content. That would be my feedback to distro Plaza, but

16:12.820 --> 16:16.180
It's kind of neat. It's a neat idea. It is a neat idea

16:16.180 --> 16:16.540
Yeah

16:16.540 --> 16:19.420
I could definitely see a direction where this could be really really powerful

16:19.780 --> 16:24.940
Like a one-stop place to get information get the downloads the thing is this has been tried before so you got to really figure out

16:24.940 --> 16:31.420
A way to do something different here. I think right right. I I would I would caution against so I would go one direction or the other

16:31.420 --> 16:36.820
I would definitely caution against the community aspect of it unless you're vetting specific people that you trust or at least you know

16:36.820 --> 16:39.580
No, I'm gonna just spam spam your stuff. You could try that approach

16:39.580 --> 16:44.020
But I think really the idea of showing folks that you know, you're this type of person

16:44.020 --> 16:45.420
You should be looking at these distros

16:45.420 --> 16:50.060
You're that type of person you should be looking at that distros and look at the other attempts that have been made try and fine-tune

16:50.060 --> 16:52.060
That dial it in a little better. I don't know

16:52.060 --> 16:57.340
Maybe some previous things failed. Yeah, cuz there's some that have tried that aren't really that great

16:58.060 --> 17:04.380
This actually is very clean. I like the layout. So good. It's very promising mumble room any thoughts any advice for our friend

17:04.380 --> 17:09.180
David who wants to set up distro Plaza a place to feature distros and talk about them and download them

17:11.260 --> 17:13.260
No going once, okay

17:13.300 --> 17:14.580
Nobody had well, there you go David

17:14.580 --> 17:19.300
You got Matt nice advice and the the mumble room will check it out after the show perhaps you can you can to listener distro Plaza

17:19.300 --> 17:22.780
calm one last topic and then we're out of the feedback

17:22.780 --> 17:25.460
I know I know but I want to give everybody a chance to chime in

17:25.460 --> 17:30.420
I love the community interaction. In fact, it was one of the reasons why we started this show. It's wax of the reason. Yeah, so

17:31.100 --> 17:37.900
Well, right then it sounded to me like Chris was pronouncing you block as you block, but I think it's pronounced mu block

17:37.900 --> 17:43.340
He's not even shitting. You know the one that spelt you block. It's actually obviously it's a moo

17:43.340 --> 17:47.860
Yeah, how because it's actually a Greek you so it's pronounced

17:47.860 --> 17:52.260
Oh, yeah, like a micro since it's a lightweight regarding but anyways, he says back to adblock plus

17:52.260 --> 17:57.580
I started using adblock plus shortly after it started even back when there's no option to allow Google text ads

17:57.700 --> 18:01.780
He thinks that people care too much about it the acceptable ads program that we talked about last week

18:01.780 --> 18:06.180
It's easy to change subscriptions in adblock plus so the one doesn't have a whitelist ads if you don't want them

18:06.220 --> 18:10.220
But I think adblock plus is playing with fire a little bit. It reminds me a bit of the net neutrality issue

18:10.980 --> 18:12.980
How block plus wants to provide?

18:13.300 --> 18:16.020
To provide some privilege to some ads over others

18:16.020 --> 18:23.140
Resources or money in other words and are necessary to review ads and decide what is acceptable and when it isn't they have chosen to

18:23.140 --> 18:27.340
Let companies pay to be reviewed faster, which effectively means companies can get in ahead of other people

18:27.780 --> 18:33.100
They will stay they will say that the prioritization does not impact their criteria for what is acceptable ad

18:33.340 --> 18:38.020
But their money incentives for the program really don't line up with what is best for the user and this is something I didn't realize

18:38.020 --> 18:42.020
I didn't realize that I knew you could pay adblock plus not to be on their block list

18:42.020 --> 18:46.580
I didn't know that you could pay adblock plus to grease the wheels a little bit sort of like when you're getting a passport

18:46.580 --> 18:48.580
You want to you want to rush it?

18:48.620 --> 18:54.340
Yeah, see here's the and I I did and here's why I don't care because I mean I care in a sense

18:54.340 --> 19:00.380
But I think it's important to really really take this way until it's being bundled into browsers or forced onto people

19:00.900 --> 19:03.340
It'll take care of itself. I think it'll snuff itself out

19:03.340 --> 19:05.620
I think he's gonna pay a heavy price for it because I think it's a bad idea

19:06.220 --> 19:09.300
But if it was pre-installed, yeah, that would be very scary

19:09.300 --> 19:13.020
That would be very that'd be frightening because then it then it isn't that neutrality issue at that point

19:13.020 --> 19:16.060
Yeah, and it is you're right is the user's opt-in. So yeah, that's a good point

19:16.060 --> 19:23.080
Yeah, but it definitely I agree that it's a it's a very shady sleazy not very long-term healthy kind of approach. So

19:23.820 --> 19:27.580
Yeah, I still remain I still I think one of the reasons one to read this emails

19:27.580 --> 19:29.940
I'm still pretty undecided on the whole ad blocking thing

19:29.940 --> 19:35.260
I mean obviously where this show is an ad supported show and so I wouldn't want people to block ads on this show

19:35.260 --> 19:36.600
I'm sure a lot of people skip them

19:36.600 --> 19:39.420
I would hope they don't and we try to change them up a little bit

19:39.420 --> 19:41.940
So that way you won't and it would cut it would hurt us

19:41.940 --> 19:46.260
Like so if if there was such a thing as ad block for podcasts and 90% of the people listened

19:46.260 --> 19:47.980
We would go out of business

19:47.980 --> 19:51.980
Well, so here when it comes to advertising and this includes Adsense or audio ads

19:51.980 --> 19:54.460
The thing you have to remember is is that advertisement?

19:54.460 --> 20:00.140
Does it have any slim potential of offering a true benefit to the user our ads do we like them?

20:00.140 --> 20:03.260
We feel that they're awesome things that we're excited about we want to share them

20:03.260 --> 20:11.020
even Adsense to a limited degree, especially when it first came out did potentially offer some advantage to a user they go to a

20:11.420 --> 20:12.940
Maybe a decor website

20:12.940 --> 20:16.260
They're gonna have decor ads that might help them enhance enhance what they're wanting to do

20:16.260 --> 20:21.180
Now that being said when you have flashing banners and pop unders, that's not a value-added situation

20:21.580 --> 20:26.620
That needs to die in a fire. So, you know, so my philosophy on that is you know

20:27.100 --> 20:31.040
People are gonna use these apps. They want to do that. That's fine. So in tech circles

20:31.040 --> 20:34.300
Yes, ad blocking is gonna happen outside of tech circles. It's a mood issue

20:34.740 --> 20:41.300
I think we're in a good position because our stuff is audio based and video based where it's really not as not as big

20:41.300 --> 20:44.580
Of an issue in that regard except for obviously Adsense and things like that

20:44.580 --> 20:46.900
But yeah, and I think you made a good point like it's the wash

20:46.900 --> 20:51.020
It's on it and this is and then we'll get off this because it's not strictly related

20:51.020 --> 20:55.100
But I guess this is why I have kind of kept opting back to turning off ad blockers is

20:55.660 --> 20:59.700
Because if the publisher wants to publish a full-screen takeover ad

20:59.700 --> 21:02.820
Then I want to be able to judge them for that

21:02.820 --> 21:06.540
And so like one of them like you said one of the things is we make sure like the ads we pick

21:06.540 --> 21:11.780
There's not a single sponsor. We have that, you know, we don't actually use like right exactly. That's a big deal

21:11.780 --> 21:15.820
We actually like these so it's not like we're just you know, picking random people out of a hat, you know

21:16.340 --> 21:19.640
And so yeah, that's that's where I think they so they cross the line

21:19.640 --> 21:24.700
They sort of like they sort of take the audience for granted in that regard and they shove too much in their face

21:24.700 --> 21:27.780
And it's never it's it's it can't work when you when you do that much as its noise

21:27.780 --> 21:30.500
And that's why people I think resort to using ad block

21:30.500 --> 21:34.780
I think it's and most importantly does it inhibit the user experience?

21:34.780 --> 21:42.660
That's when an ad block is acceptable at any case in any scenario if it's in literally legitimately inhibiting an experience now a quick

21:43.100 --> 21:45.940
Commercial before YouTube video is not inhibiting your experience

21:46.300 --> 21:49.140
20 a few seconds in it gives you the option to skip it get over yourself

21:49.140 --> 21:50.040
Yeah, yeah

21:50.040 --> 21:54.700
but if it's a big but if you're on a mobile phone and you've got that big ad that just covers up the entire screen and

21:54.700 --> 21:59.420
It's playing video and you can't find the X that's inhibiting my experience. They need to that needs to stop. Yeah

22:00.860 --> 22:03.340
And now I would like to take a moment to tell you about vitamins and

22:07.260 --> 22:09.260
And power shakes, yeah

22:11.780 --> 22:16.700
I we the numbers been pretty quiet on the ad issue anybody have any final thoughts before we close the book on this topic

22:16.700 --> 22:18.700
Mamba room. This is your chance

22:19.060 --> 22:21.060
well, you know, it's

22:21.060 --> 22:24.100
the adverts on TV and

22:26.020 --> 22:32.700
Podcasts and you know radio or whatever. They're they're all a lot a lot more difficult to

22:34.460 --> 22:37.100
Get away from than adverts on the web

22:37.100 --> 22:39.140
I mean brevets on TV

22:39.140 --> 22:44.020
I used to have a PVR that actually had an advert skip button and all it was was a

22:44.300 --> 22:50.160
One-minute forward skip and I knew that I could go bam bam bam bam and forward skip through the TV others and I had no

22:50.160 --> 22:54.080
moral compunction during that whatsoever right yet the

22:54.640 --> 22:59.200
Yeah, and there's a big TV company and I'm paying for the delivery of that that service to my house

22:59.200 --> 23:01.480
Anyway, whereas an independent

23:02.120 --> 23:05.600
Content creator on the web. It's it's a different story. There's like

23:06.680 --> 23:14.360
Sometimes one guy who's creating that website and maintaining it keeping it running running the server and creating the content as their full-time job

23:14.360 --> 23:17.200
And so I generally don't run adblock at all

23:17.200 --> 23:22.800
Unless the site looks like a bag of crap like for Onyx in which case I will

23:25.600 --> 23:32.120
So far that's totally that's totally larval like you're explaining these one guy runs the whole thing he matches all of that but yeah

23:32.800 --> 23:37.480
Right. It's a tough line to walk and it's particularly hard. I mean not to not to take this in a weird direction

23:38.560 --> 23:45.800
But it is particularly hard to monetize probably more hard than normal in the free and open source software community because oh, yeah

23:45.800 --> 23:50.680
yeah, you know what I mean, so like I mean not necessarily I mean obviously people are willing to pay with in the I mean

23:50.680 --> 23:55.400
Look at the humble bundle and our patreon people are willing to pay when they feel there's value there

23:55.400 --> 24:00.760
But I think some people are a little afraid of that and I can understand people also pay when they're guilt-tripped into it

24:00.760 --> 24:06.760
I mean look last week what happened to the the GNU PG developer guy story comes out and suddenly his

24:07.280 --> 24:11.360
Donation goes from like 20,000 euros up to 120,000 years in a day

24:11.360 --> 24:18.920
And you know when people feel guilty about it, then yeah, they they will throw a few coins in in sure

24:18.920 --> 24:22.480
So, you know help maintain it but often they won't do anything

24:22.480 --> 24:28.840
You know people will pay the minimum for humble bundle no matter what anyone says about the fact that Linux users pay more

24:29.200 --> 24:31.640
Many people pay the absolute. Yeah

24:32.280 --> 24:38.020
They they need to so, you know, and everyone's in the same boat. Nobody has like buckets of money for us, right? Yeah

24:38.020 --> 24:43.260
It's a lot of things also try to get under Google's example when it comes to things

24:43.260 --> 24:48.940
So they don't really know of many other alternative ways to fund their project. They just do that the Google way had

24:49.380 --> 24:50.740
otherwise

24:50.740 --> 24:57.020
Yeah, but I think having or asking or saying that you need something and if it's a really good project like, you know

24:57.020 --> 24:59.020
GNU PG or

24:59.180 --> 25:05.100
AdLock if you ask their users and you have a good product that's worth paying for well, I pay for it. Mm-hmm

25:05.100 --> 25:12.740
Yeah, that's exactly how I feel, too. Yeah, I'll make two points is I think that it really behooves the content creators to do their

25:12.740 --> 25:14.580
due diligence and

25:14.580 --> 25:20.460
Looking into who's advertising and how they're advertising such as you guys do and the other thing is, you know

25:20.860 --> 25:26.900
sometimes you'll get caught up in people using ad block because of all the sites that don't do that due diligence and

25:26.900 --> 25:29.300
We have to be reminded to go turn it off for your pages

25:29.300 --> 25:34.740
Mm-hmm. Well and read it has a nice approach if you use ad block and read it

25:34.740 --> 25:37.260
It says hey, you know, you're using ad block and that's cool

25:37.260 --> 25:39.940
But if you don't use it, they actually have a little banner that appears to says hey

25:39.940 --> 25:43.420
Thank you for not using ad block on our site. Yeah, that's that's the way to do it

25:43.420 --> 25:47.940
I find reddit ads are pretty pretty tame. Yeah, I don't really mind them at all

25:48.420 --> 25:51.460
And and I do like being thanked for turning off ad block

25:51.460 --> 25:59.620
I know that's a stupid thing, but I do kind of like it. It helps. It's psychological. You can't argue. Like you know what? You're welcome

25:59.620 --> 26:03.140
Because that exact little thing is what's reminded me in some instances

26:03.140 --> 26:08.060
Oh, I have ad block on or you block and you go turn it off. Yeah, and I just whitelist them now

26:08.060 --> 26:11.900
I mean, it's like I'm okay with that. Yeah. Yeah, good point. All right

26:11.900 --> 26:14.940
Well, you know what a chat room wants to talk about it

26:14.940 --> 26:18.780
Maybe in just a second before we get into the world just real briefly then we're gonna be a bunch of fun stuff

26:18.780 --> 26:24.700
Chairman really wants to talk about this Raspberry Pi 2 problem. Oh, yeah. So yeah, okay. We'll do that

26:24.700 --> 26:26.700
We'll do that. I think we'll have a quick one on that

26:26.740 --> 26:31.420
Why don't we you know what? We'll mention one of our great sponsors one of the ones that we use one that I've used for

26:31.420 --> 26:35.140
Over two years now. I've been a ting customer for over two years. I think math clocking up on that, too

26:35.260 --> 26:40.020
It's got a really close. If not, I mean, it's got it. I mean really it's yeah, it's got to be close two years

26:40.020 --> 26:41.660
and so I

26:41.660 --> 26:47.580
Can say now confidently that I am truly a ting user and I do recommend them start by going to linux.ting.com

26:47.580 --> 26:50.340
That's gonna give you $25 off your first device now

26:50.340 --> 26:55.220
I'll tell you why that's a big deal here in a second if you have a ting compatible device and because they're adding

26:55.220 --> 26:57.220
GSM there's more and more all the time

26:57.860 --> 27:01.700
You're gonna get a $25 credit that credit might just pay for your first month. Here's why?

27:02.940 --> 27:04.620
No contract

27:04.620 --> 27:12.500
No early termination fee. You only pay for what you use what you only pay for what you use. I know I know it's crazy

27:12.500 --> 27:17.860
You're here's what you're saying. You're saying Chris crazy things too crazy. They can't afford to do that. You know what you're wrong

27:18.060 --> 27:20.060
You're wrong Kyra's here to tell you why?

27:20.180 --> 27:23.740
Ting keeps rates simple. We don't make you pick a plan instead

27:23.740 --> 27:28.540
You just use your phone as you normally would how much you use determines how much you pay each month

27:28.740 --> 27:31.180
You can have as many devices as you want on one account

27:31.500 --> 27:32.380
That's good

27:32.380 --> 27:36.540
Because when you use more you pay less per minute message or megabyte of data

27:36.740 --> 27:41.700
Your usage plus six dollars per active device on your account plus taxes is your monthly bill

27:41.700 --> 27:44.700
Simple that's what we mean when we say

27:46.420 --> 27:53.180
Mobile that makes sense. Yeah, go over to linux.ting.com just get that savings by the way remember how I said that $25 matters

27:53.900 --> 27:57.900
From time to time ting get some great deals in on my fi hotspots

27:57.900 --> 28:02.540
And they just got back in the Novotel my fi 5580 once you go to linux.ting.com

28:02.660 --> 28:05.940
That's a $96 tri-band LTE hotspot

28:06.660 --> 28:09.920
$96 you own that thing. It's not it's not locked either you own it

28:09.920 --> 28:13.160
It's yours, and it's six dollars for the line

28:13.300 --> 28:17.860
You can even turn that off when you don't need it, and then you just pay for the data usage

28:17.860 --> 28:19.260
Why wouldn't you just have that in your pocket now?

28:19.260 --> 28:24.060
They don't have this device all the time, so I mentioned it right now again. It's the Novotel my fi 5580

28:24.740 --> 28:31.940
$96 tri-band LTE hotspot with a LCD screen on the front that gives you your signal stats your connected devices your battery information

28:32.180 --> 28:37.140
What type of cellular network you're on and this is great even if you just use it when you travel?

28:37.140 --> 28:41.260
This is an unbelievable value, and they got every kind of device you'd want start by going to linux.ting.com

28:41.340 --> 28:44.580
And if you have any questions you can call them at one eight five five ting

28:44.980 --> 28:47.140
FTW also on their blog right now if

28:47.580 --> 28:49.100
And I know from some of the emails

28:49.100 --> 28:54.500
I've gotten net neutrality and title two are on your mind ting has been very upfront about their position and

28:54.660 --> 28:59.380
What they think is important in this debate and discussion, and they have another blog post up on there

28:59.380 --> 29:01.500
It's on its ting.com slash blog

29:01.540 --> 29:03.740
But start by going to linux.ting.com to read that

29:03.740 --> 29:08.620
And they also up on the blog have a tip for how you can download Google Maps for offline use if

29:08.820 --> 29:11.340
You're gonna go somewhere. We don't have signal or you want to save some data

29:12.140 --> 29:15.740
Turns out there's actually a really great way to save the maps in Google Maps offline

29:15.740 --> 29:19.280
So you can get them without even a connection they have that up on their blog as well linux.ting.com

29:19.620 --> 29:24.040
And a big thank you to ting for sponsoring linux unplugged and thank you all of you for out there and trying them

29:24.040 --> 29:27.300
I can say I really do recommend them and by the end of February

29:27.740 --> 29:30.740
Things are really gonna get crazy for ting when they're rolling it when they're rocking

29:30.740 --> 29:37.660
GSM and CDMA at the same time that is it's gonna be huge huge. Who else is doing that nobody exactly nobody else is doing that

29:38.220 --> 29:39.820
Linux nothing calm

29:39.820 --> 29:41.060
Okay, so real quick

29:41.060 --> 29:45.220
I guess it turns out this new Raspberry Pi 2 that we were talking about last week

29:45.500 --> 29:50.360
If if you expose it to a bright flash like a xeon flash like on a camera flash

29:50.460 --> 29:52.660
Not just like room like you don't just turn on the light

29:52.660 --> 29:58.260
But like you really explores it to a bright light it like kills power to the device and causes it to reboot

29:58.260 --> 30:02.140
So you can reboot a Raspberry Pi 2 by flashing a light at it

30:02.300 --> 30:07.700
So what you're telling me is no Raspberry Pi's can be used in

30:08.180 --> 30:11.340
porn studios photography situations, I mean like so

30:14.460 --> 30:19.020
I mean, you know, well, I got one in my basement, you know, so you just totally killed my dream here, right?

30:19.020 --> 30:23.300
I mean, it's like oh my god that just that totally just see I can't that just totally changes everything

30:23.300 --> 30:24.700
I gotta go and get nuts or something

30:24.700 --> 30:29.380
I know I think people just find this to be funny because it's probably not and I guess there's even like an epoxy paint people

30:29.380 --> 30:34.020
Already using to cover up the chip and and make it so it's not but it's just it's hilarious. Oh

30:35.060 --> 30:39.780
In a go-go way you have something to comment about lasers on the Raspberry Pi. This sounds um

30:40.500 --> 30:45.860
But someone I was reading a reddit. Someone also said the laser also affects the Raspberry Pi and does the same effect

30:46.780 --> 30:48.780
lasers freaking lasers

30:50.260 --> 30:52.260
On their head

30:52.260 --> 30:57.340
Yeah, I didn't I don't know what to make of this but I know people that adore them I thought that was funny

30:57.700 --> 30:58.340
So yeah

30:58.340 --> 31:02.740
Is it me or does it strike me as Jerry Springer in a way like you could actually have a Raspberry Pi sitting on a on

31:02.740 --> 31:06.940
A chair and you know the other person with lasers and flashlights attached to them having this conversation

31:06.940 --> 31:08.580
I don't know the whole thing just seems silly

31:08.580 --> 31:13.620
I was picturing like like elite government agents who take over like a

31:14.100 --> 31:20.020
Middle-eastern compound that using Raspberry Pis by going in flashing lights at the Raspberry Pi is causing the security grid to crash and then they

31:20.020 --> 31:23.220
Infiltrate and drop troops in and and it's a big American

31:23.220 --> 31:27.360
It's the next big American movie and it all happened because they flashed lights at Raspberry Pis

31:28.380 --> 31:30.380
No, that's pretty in-depth

31:31.580 --> 31:34.860
That's where I was going with that. All right. Oh any other thoughts?

31:35.620 --> 31:39.920
They'll just put that in the black hatchet or something. Yeah, sure. Yeah, exactly

31:40.740 --> 31:45.500
Advertising as a feature you could yeah, you know, you could set up lighting in your in your server room

31:45.500 --> 31:50.140
We have a bunch of Raspberry Pis and you could flash the lights when you need all your servers to reboot. There you go. Yeah

31:50.700 --> 31:56.860
All right. Yeah, let's let's let's talk about what we're all really here gathered today to talk about and that's this new BQ phone

31:57.380 --> 32:02.740
That goes on sale next week. It's like around 170. I think what is it? Like probably like a hundred?

32:02.740 --> 32:05.520
I don't know about 175 dollars. I don't know what it's going for exactly us

32:06.100 --> 32:07.580
and

32:07.580 --> 32:10.060
There's even a little video now. I don't think there's a lot of words in this video

32:10.060 --> 32:12.180
So I'll just I'll just put up on the stream so we can look at it

32:12.180 --> 32:16.460
I mean, it's it's definitely a very fancy video after all of the waiting

32:16.460 --> 32:20.580
I mean it I know it's only been a couple of years, but it feels I mean, that's a long time

32:21.300 --> 32:25.300
In the scheme of developing something like this. That's not actually a long time

32:25.540 --> 32:28.500
But more people sitting on the outside. It feels like a long time

32:28.900 --> 32:34.840
And so this is this video is extremely well done. I hope I don't know if you know any of the background on this video like

32:35.940 --> 32:41.300
This is the first time I saw it was last Friday. It was it was shown off at

32:41.300 --> 32:46.420
An event in London and I'd never seen before and actually that's at the bits where you see outside

32:46.420 --> 32:48.980
They go on top of a building is actually on top of our office building

32:49.620 --> 32:54.780
Yeah, I can recognize certain, you know parts. Oh, that's funny in the video

32:54.780 --> 32:57.420
Yeah, I think and we'll have the video linked in the show notes

32:57.420 --> 33:03.580
I think one of the things the video does really well for me is it it's essentially without being too obvious about it showing me

33:04.220 --> 33:10.420
You know kind of how Ubuntu touch would sort of fit in with like the ideal daily lifestyle that of course nobody truly lives

33:10.420 --> 33:17.180
But if you live that like it I get like contextual information becomes available to me just by watching that commercial like it's surprisingly effective

33:17.820 --> 33:22.380
Life at your fingertips is the slogan. That's pretty good. This is really well done. I

33:23.740 --> 33:27.100
Think so, I think they did a nice job with it. I think it's gonna be interesting to see where it goes to

33:28.420 --> 33:33.340
So the Aquarius e4 5 4.5. It's 4.5 inch screen, huh?

33:35.260 --> 33:39.140
Well, so there you go, so the bq phone it's not like it's not a screamer of a phone

33:39.140 --> 33:41.140
It's not gonna blow you away with its stats

33:41.620 --> 33:45.780
It's got a 4.5 inch screen runs at 540 by 960 resolution

33:46.260 --> 33:53.860
1.3 gigahertz quad-core ARM Cortex a7 media tech CPU a molly 400 GPU at 500 megahertz again

33:53.860 --> 34:01.320
Media tech 8 gigabyte EMC storage 1 gigabyte of RAM 2150 mil amp battery dual micro sim and 8 megapixel rear shooter

34:02.300 --> 34:07.840
As far as first goes it's not bad, especially if you consider that, you know for a certain sector of the market

34:07.840 --> 34:09.840
That's plenty phone. Oh, yeah

34:10.540 --> 34:17.180
I think anyone coming into the smartphone space for the first time is gonna be pleasantly surprised and I think that's really where they're gonna hit

34:17.180 --> 34:20.540
Their sweet spot now, that's where I would target. I think that seems like that's what they're doing now

34:20.540 --> 34:22.740
It's not launching in the US yet. Yeah

34:24.620 --> 34:27.980
But it is available it'll be available I wonder I wonder if I'll still be able to buy it

34:29.700 --> 34:31.700
The the

34:31.700 --> 34:38.940
The event that will happen last Friday there were 30 people invited from this is around the world

34:39.180 --> 34:44.900
Yeah, it's called the yeah, the insiders event the Ubuntu inside is they were actually invited a couple of months ago

34:44.900 --> 34:49.380
We built a list of people that we thought might be interesting to come along and and see it

34:49.380 --> 34:53.540
and there was a couple of journalists a couple of video bloggers and

34:54.220 --> 34:55.700
some

34:55.700 --> 34:58.380
some like blogger bloggers like written bloggers and

34:58.380 --> 35:05.980
Members of our community developers and what you might call outsiders from the community

35:06.660 --> 35:12.460
Just come along and we give them a phone and they get to be the the first

35:12.940 --> 35:14.660
People with one of these devices

35:14.660 --> 35:20.000
We also gave them a few little tidbits of information over the over the month leading up to it

35:20.380 --> 35:25.060
and then we flew them out to London on on Friday and they they came and saw the

35:25.220 --> 35:27.540
that video and a couple of talks by

35:27.540 --> 35:30.380
I was a guy from BQ there. There was a

35:31.580 --> 35:33.580
Couple of people from canonical giving talks

35:34.380 --> 35:36.380
It was really good fun

35:37.020 --> 35:38.380
Phone right?

35:38.380 --> 35:44.220
Yeah, we gave them all phone and it was in a special presentation origami presentation box

35:44.900 --> 35:46.900
there was a phone and a

35:47.700 --> 35:54.500
Pair of nice headphones. Yeah, it even it even warranted the Ubuntu phones first official unboxing video

35:54.500 --> 35:59.460
Which omg Ubuntu picked up and ran that Ubuntu phone box is slick. I gotta say that's a nice looking box

35:59.940 --> 36:01.940
it was funny the

36:02.140 --> 36:04.860
We were asking them. Look do you mind if we video you?

36:05.260 --> 36:08.980
Opening because we know what it's like, you know, people want to see the thing on the box

36:08.980 --> 36:12.540
Yeah, and so the video that you're showing now of that's Jordan Keys

36:13.420 --> 36:17.220
Unboxing yes his he actually ran back to his hotel room

36:17.540 --> 36:23.100
Or ran back to another room in order to to do that and then we went out for beer in the evening while his video

36:23.100 --> 36:27.140
Was rendering out and then he uploaded it to YouTube when he got back after a few beers

36:28.020 --> 36:30.020
It was it was good. It was a good day

36:30.180 --> 36:32.900
I noticed too that I noticed that they come with a

36:33.540 --> 36:38.420
The the insiders edition came with a very nice set of just headphones like an extra perk there. That's really cool

36:39.060 --> 36:45.700
yeah, yeah, we wanted to give them a little bit of something extra say thank you for taking part and and you know

36:46.220 --> 36:47.660
Coming all the way to the UK

36:47.660 --> 36:49.020
I mean some of them flew over

36:49.020 --> 36:53.740
Some of them didn't have far to come but it was nice of them to come over and just take part and and give us

36:53.740 --> 36:56.740
Feedback as well, you know, we've been capturing feedback from them

36:56.740 --> 37:01.900
You know, I was walking around on the Friday with a notebook old-style paper notebook right now

37:01.900 --> 37:04.500
We're saying hey what about this and how does that work?

37:04.500 --> 37:08.380
And why is this like this and I was making lists and you know

37:08.380 --> 37:12.620
I've been giving feedback to developers and filing bugs like, you know

37:12.780 --> 37:17.820
Doing all the due diligence because these are the first people that have seen them outside canonical. We've all seen it evolve

37:17.820 --> 37:22.540
You know, I've had one of those phones since August last year and I use it every day

37:23.060 --> 37:25.780
But there are things you just don't notice and then when someone

37:26.380 --> 37:31.220
Why why is it doing allowing me to do this? Anything? Oh, wow. Yeah, you're right. Yeah

37:32.020 --> 37:36.040
It's just something because you use it every day. You just don't think that's yet. Very much do that

37:36.040 --> 37:42.380
Yeah, very much. So that is very true. So so actually they they go on sale as a flash sale starting tomorrow

37:42.460 --> 37:45.980
Which is Wednesday the 11th of February at 8

37:45.980 --> 37:47.980
8 o'clock

37:48.060 --> 37:54.180
UTC so it's 9 central European flash sale means only gonna be available for a limited time or suckers like me

37:54.180 --> 37:57.060
Are we gonna be able to buy it or is it only gonna be a region?

37:57.060 --> 38:04.140
It's all day. So it's 9 9 the central European time till 6 central. So 8 till 5 UTC

38:05.020 --> 38:09.500
So yeah, it's a fairly lengthy amount of time throughout the day. It's not like, you know, a 10-minute flash

38:09.500 --> 38:14.900
So it's not like the whole world has to be dos. So I might actually website for the day

38:14.900 --> 38:16.900
I know you could try

38:17.660 --> 38:21.100
Yeah, I'm certainly going to bed early so I could get up

38:21.100 --> 38:26.980
It's like Christmas for me tomorrow because I'm gonna be ordering one. Obviously. Yeah, you know, we're all gonna be ordering them

38:26.980 --> 38:28.920
Are you pretty excited?

38:28.920 --> 38:32.780
Yeah, it's it's you know, the fact that you know

38:32.780 --> 38:36.460
I started working at canonical three years ago knowing that this was gonna happen and

38:36.860 --> 38:40.140
It's taken a long time for us to get here and we've you know

38:40.140 --> 38:47.820
we've had a lot of flack along the way and the method by which we've developed this and the software choices that we've made and

38:48.300 --> 38:49.420
the

38:49.420 --> 38:54.800
Hardware specification of the first device, you know, this is remember. This is the first Ubuntu phone, right?

38:55.460 --> 38:59.020
Hopefully one of many devices, you know if we come back on

39:00.100 --> 39:01.940
unplugged episode

39:01.940 --> 39:05.820
600 they'll be you know a plethora of these phones out there who knows

39:05.820 --> 39:11.060
You know, are you already looking at the next device a little bit because I know they we've already said the next one is there

39:11.060 --> 39:16.340
Yeah, yeah, that one's gonna be a little more like a larger screen, right one thing and yeah

39:16.340 --> 39:21.040
It's yeah, it's quite a bigger screen and more it's more cores more round, you know

39:21.040 --> 39:24.340
Yeah more and bigger of everything. But yeah

39:26.300 --> 39:28.620
How important was it, you know

39:28.620 --> 39:33.220
You mentioned that you've had one iteration of this another since August is that part of why you know

39:33.220 --> 39:37.740
you got to start and you kind of have to lock in the specs at some place and then start developing for that and so

39:38.420 --> 39:42.300
This bq phone. Yeah, it's sort of been locked in for a while. I take it

39:42.900 --> 39:48.860
Right, and so we initially were you know, we've had loads of different hardware over the the time that we've developed this

39:48.860 --> 39:53.140
We started off with a tablet edition on an Asus transformer TF 101

39:53.140 --> 39:53.420
Yeah

39:53.420 --> 40:00.180
And we've moved through very and Nokia n9 and various Samsung galaxies and Nexus devices and you know

40:00.180 --> 40:05.300
Then we got a partner in bq so we grabbed a bunch of those devices and we started doing the hardware

40:05.500 --> 40:11.460
Enablement and making sure all the apps work because you know if we've been focusing on the Nexus 4 then we discover that

40:11.460 --> 40:16.020
Oh, actually certain dialogues don't feel on the screen. I was this thing slightly different

40:16.020 --> 40:22.360
so so we have to make sure all our apps and the dash is responsive and you know scales down to

40:22.700 --> 40:26.820
Devices of this size and it's actually made us more disciplined having a device that has

40:26.820 --> 40:33.620
more constrained hardware resources is probably better for us if we had the MX for first and

40:34.100 --> 40:36.980
Had your octo core with 2 gig of RAM, right?

40:36.980 --> 40:43.380
We could have gone nuts and you know made some decisions that actually we'd regret later because we'd have to try and scale it back

40:43.620 --> 40:44.700
whereas

40:44.700 --> 40:46.700
from what I'm told

40:47.240 --> 40:51.100
Even unoptimized on the MX for it flies along. I haven't actually got one myself

40:51.780 --> 40:53.620
But I'm told it flies along

40:53.620 --> 40:58.540
And it's you know, it's pretty good on this bq device and we've still got some more optimization to do

40:59.140 --> 41:05.620
So yeah, there's still work and we're still ongoing and and the good thing is that we continue to deliver updates to that device

41:05.620 --> 41:07.700
so even when we've moved on to the to the

41:08.180 --> 41:13.740
MX for and the next device and the next device all the previous devices continue to get those updates

41:13.940 --> 41:16.560
The MX for looks so sweet

41:17.460 --> 41:22.260
Wow, this looks like a yeah. Yeah, I mean I want the bq just to have the experience

41:22.260 --> 41:25.620
But I think the one I'm gonna land on would be the MX for this is an incredible phone

41:25.620 --> 41:31.460
I want them all. Yeah. Well sure, of course. That's like trading cards. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah, exactly. Yeah

41:32.260 --> 41:33.900
so

41:33.900 --> 41:37.960
How much how much energy do you do you suspect canonical will put into?

41:38.980 --> 41:41.760
Sort of like I don't want to know if a generic image is the right one

41:41.760 --> 41:47.880
But an image that's essentially with some modifications that'll work on most smartphones. Is that something canonical ever come?

41:47.880 --> 41:52.940
You can't really do that because the arm architecture so let you so there's a couple of things

41:52.940 --> 41:58.940
Yeah, arm doesn't really have the concept that the PC world has in terms of a CPI and device discovery

41:58.940 --> 42:02.280
You know, that's that that's very mature on the PC and you can have one code base

42:02.700 --> 42:08.580
Stickers USB stick in it and it will boot auto discover everything and figure out what drivers to load at runtime

42:09.380 --> 42:11.380
And the second problem is most

42:12.180 --> 42:15.660
SOC is most of the chips that are in phones have

42:15.660 --> 42:18.100
binary blobs and you know

42:18.100 --> 42:22.740
That's that's sad and disappointing and but that's just the world we we live in right now

42:22.740 --> 42:26.900
There are no free soft fully free software phones. None. No whatsoever

42:26.900 --> 42:32.380
So whenever anyone complains to us that we're not a fully free software phone. Well, good luck finding one

42:32.380 --> 42:34.740
Well, yeah, if you want to if you want to phone just phone calls

42:35.460 --> 42:39.780
Right. Yeah, or is usable in any way shape or form. Yeah, so

42:39.780 --> 42:46.060
We you know, we we have to build an image that is used, you know usable on a specific device

42:46.060 --> 42:51.220
but that's that's actually where we've been quite cunning with this is that we have multiple layers to the

42:51.660 --> 42:54.420
To the image that goes on the on the phone

42:54.420 --> 42:58.620
There's the very base layer which is the device specific part and that's you know

42:58.620 --> 43:02.580
There'll be a device specific bit for BQ a device specific bit for the MX for and then

43:04.220 --> 43:08.620
What is that is that is that a specific kernel what what is that layer composed of?

43:08.620 --> 43:17.020
Yeah, so that's the that's effectively the kernel and the drivers for things like the GPU the radios and all that the sensors

43:17.020 --> 43:21.540
You know, so so for example if a device comes along that has a fingerprint sensor just for the sake of argument

43:21.540 --> 43:25.100
You know, we might want to support that and there'll be a device specific thing driver

43:25.100 --> 43:30.660
Yeah, we need to go in but on top of that is the second layer, which is the user space bit

43:30.660 --> 43:32.220
which has got all of our

43:32.220 --> 43:35.420
Ubuntu stuff in and the dash and then on top of that is your apps

43:35.420 --> 43:41.100
But also the the OEM or the carrier can put their own

43:41.940 --> 43:46.280
additional bit on top so so we control a bit in the middle that's that's the

43:47.340 --> 43:49.340
the app the the

43:49.380 --> 43:54.980
Api's and all the stuff people right? Yeah and the dash and the common bit that you would see across all the devices

43:55.540 --> 43:58.180
The bit at the bottom is the device enablement

43:58.180 --> 44:00.580
And so that means that when a new device comes out

44:00.580 --> 44:04.580
All we need to do is do the device enablement and then it's the same user space that runs on those

44:04.580 --> 44:08.260
And so when and when when we want to update an old device

44:08.260 --> 44:12.620
We just update the middle section and the device enablement bit stays the same

44:13.500 --> 44:20.000
That's a really good approach and you can see it means you don't have that fragmentation that that Android has we have you know

44:20.000 --> 44:24.220
We can have as lots of different devices on the market and they're all effectively running the same code

44:24.220 --> 44:26.660
well, and it seems like it's approachable by just a

44:27.580 --> 44:31.360
You know a fairly well organized community could come together and say, all right

44:31.360 --> 44:36.580
Well, we'll take on supporting the Nexus 4 for another couple of years or we'll make a Nexus 5 port and me as a more

44:36.580 --> 44:41.540
sophisticated user could say you know what I know this community I'll go use their image because if I'm following you the only thing they

44:41.540 --> 44:45.180
Would really have to modify would be that first layer that that lower level bits, right?

44:45.460 --> 44:50.900
Right, and so someone has already created the Nexus 5 as you know, and you know, it has issues

44:50.900 --> 44:57.260
It's not perfect hardware wise we're gonna continue to maintain the Nexus 4 Nexus 7 and Nexus 10 and then what other

44:57.260 --> 45:01.260
wherever other devices come along that we have to support, you know for

45:02.060 --> 45:05.960
Contractual agreement for things like BQ and Meizu and and and so on

45:06.780 --> 45:11.980
So we'll continue to maintain, you know a whole bunch of devices going going forward. Hmm

45:12.020 --> 45:12.620
All right

45:12.620 --> 45:16.820
I got a couple more questions and then and then I'll open up the moment because I know they have a couple questions

45:16.820 --> 45:20.420
This is really I I'm exceptional. I'm exceptionally excited about this because I know we've all I

45:20.980 --> 45:25.740
We've all just been watching this and so this is a really exciting first step and I know the BQ phone isn't perfect

45:25.740 --> 45:31.540
maybe we'll talk about that too and and kind of get poppies idea on sort of what expectations we should have maybe performance wise and

45:32.140 --> 45:36.300
You know battery life and things like that. But first I'll tell you about Linux Academy

45:36.300 --> 45:39.680
Linux Academy is a sponsor that I think is truly great for our audience

45:40.300 --> 45:41.960
And maybe it's I'm a little biased

45:41.960 --> 45:49.380
I I believe that when somebody or a group of people are extremely passionate about something if they can line up the right things

45:49.860 --> 45:53.140
They can provide an incredible wealth of content and information

45:53.140 --> 45:58.340
and I think this is so so perfectly demonstrated with Linux Academy and

45:58.940 --> 46:02.540
To sort of validate this theory that I've been thinking of I sort of look at the other

46:03.460 --> 46:11.300
Larger outlets for sort of semi equivalent content and it's just a joke. They so obviously are checked out. They're not Linux users

46:11.300 --> 46:15.340
They're not passionate about open source. They couldn't care right they're monetizing and that's fine

46:15.340 --> 46:16.700
There's just there is room for that

46:16.700 --> 46:23.940
But if you're spending your money, why not go somewhere called Linux Academy created by Linux enthusiasts and open source professionals

46:23.940 --> 46:28.460
Who truly believe in this stuff who combined with educators and developers to create a platform for you to learn things like?

46:28.860 --> 46:33.540
Docker like OpenStack like just DevOps in general pearl python ruby

46:34.140 --> 46:41.100
R-sync backups the basic Linux administration Apache engine X they have coursewares on all of this stuff

46:41.100 --> 46:44.560
They have live streams that you can watch and ask the educators questions directly

46:44.560 --> 46:49.340
You can choose from seven plus Linux distributions. They have scenario based labs at Linux Academy

46:49.340 --> 46:51.460
So not only do they have standard lab servers

46:51.460 --> 46:56.380
You'll receive access to their scenario based labs that put you in the middle of tasks common to everyday environments

46:56.380 --> 46:59.540
So you'll actually get real experience with these scenario based labs

47:00.060 --> 47:02.180
They also have a really really great community

47:02.180 --> 47:07.020
So if you're maybe slowing down a little bit or having a downtime that community can kind of give you that boost you need

47:07.260 --> 47:11.820
It's really neat and I've been able to kind of jump in there and get my feet wet from time to time and get an idea

47:11.820 --> 47:16.380
Of what kind of things I might want to pursue and in fact this recently happened to me with Ruby where I was like

47:16.380 --> 47:18.820
I I feel like maybe it's time

47:18.820 --> 47:24.200
I just I don't want to get stagnant maybe keep myself moving forward pick some pick a new skill set to pick up

47:24.200 --> 47:27.320
But I thought you know really probably be very beneficial for me to learn a little development

47:27.320 --> 47:31.520
I've always been sort of been able to roughly read some stuff, but I can't really do much more than that

47:31.520 --> 47:34.020
And I thought well we have some Ruby use in-house

47:35.020 --> 47:38.620
Maybe I should learn Ruby and it wasn't really until I went to Linux Academy

47:38.620 --> 47:43.180
And I saw kids can take five hours and 30 minutes to learn Ruby, and I don't know what I've got

47:43.180 --> 47:44.580
I can figure out five hours

47:44.580 --> 47:50.460
Like what I put it in that in that terms like I can wrap my brain around that that's a concept I get and

47:50.740 --> 47:52.340
They'll let me set up a learning plan

47:52.340 --> 47:55.780
So I just say how much time I have and then they'll work with me and they can do the same for you

47:55.780 --> 47:57.780
It doesn't matter if you have a little time or a lot of time

47:57.820 --> 48:05.420
Linux Academy is where you want to go check them out Linux Academy dot-com slash unplug go over there get our special discount I

48:05.420 --> 48:07.900
Think you're gonna be really impressed

48:08.540 --> 48:12.660
I think yeah, I know I've been you know I know I've been talking about Linux Academy

48:12.660 --> 48:14.660
I've been talking about learning Ruby, and I'll tell you I

48:15.300 --> 48:17.940
Think that realization for me has just sort of resubmitted

48:18.260 --> 48:22.460
Submitted for me why I think this is such a great resource and why it can be such a great resource for you

48:22.780 --> 48:25.060
And I want you to try it. I want you to have that moment

48:26.100 --> 48:28.100
It's extremely empowering

48:28.140 --> 48:34.300
It gives you a level of control over your future that I I think if you're if you don't have that it's worth going over

48:34.300 --> 48:37.220
There and trying it for a little while. I don't have a better way to put it

48:37.220 --> 48:40.500
It was it was extremely gratifying to know that I could set a goal for myself

48:40.500 --> 48:46.100
And that this was a tool that would help me accomplish that goal, and it's not a bullshit goal either

48:46.100 --> 48:51.780
It's actually making myself better educating myself and learning something new I would like all of you to experience that

48:52.420 --> 48:55.820
Go over to Linux Academy dot-com slash unplugged

48:56.380 --> 49:00.100
Get our special discount. Thanks to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Linux unplugged show

49:00.100 --> 49:05.100
I think you guys be really impressed all right, so mr.. Popey

49:05.100 --> 49:07.420
I got to ask you now we've talked a lot of good stuff

49:07.420 --> 49:11.860
Is there any disclaimers you want to make about like expectations like if I buy one of these?

49:12.180 --> 49:15.060
Is there maybe gonna be performance issues you think it's gonna work, okay?

49:15.820 --> 49:20.580
So the first thing I'd say is don't expect every single app you've got on you know whatever phone

49:20.580 --> 49:25.340
You currently use to be there. We we you know we're realistic about this

49:25.340 --> 49:30.260
You know we're new to the market, and we don't have the app ecosystem that the other platforms have

49:30.260 --> 49:35.460
We just don't yet have the Skype and the what's app. You know they're not there yet, so you do have tell them

49:36.220 --> 49:42.260
Yeah, yeah, which is really cool. Yeah, that's a neat mobile app as well. Yeah, it's it's open source

49:42.260 --> 49:44.100
It's the codes on launchpad

49:44.100 --> 49:49.500
You can you know contribute if you want to if you want to add features that that you've seen in other telegram apps then

49:49.500 --> 49:54.460
Knock yourself out, and it even does badge like little numbers for unread messages in there. That's really cool

49:54.460 --> 49:58.540
Yeah, and you get notifications and all that alright, so that's a good disclaimer. You're not gonna

49:58.540 --> 50:02.420
Have all your apps probably pretty expected you could probably fill in some of the gaps with web apps

50:02.420 --> 50:06.580
But it's just probably not quite there. It's not gonna be there for a while, but that's pretty expected. I think

50:08.180 --> 50:14.340
Right and and part of this is you know I think some of the stuff we do have

50:15.220 --> 50:20.420
Conversations with software vendors all the time you know we have a team of people who are constantly discussing

50:20.420 --> 50:26.420
you know you should bring your app to Ubuntu or you should bring your framework to Ubuntu or whatever it is and so we're

50:26.420 --> 50:30.620
We're constantly having those conversations, and we know that they're those companies are are

50:31.620 --> 50:36.220
Keeping an eye on Ubuntu. Should we say yeah kind of seeing where things go and I

50:37.180 --> 50:42.860
Have noticed what what the hell is it about you guys where you managed to get?

50:43.220 --> 50:49.460
Just managed to get attention like no other company in the Linux space does like I mentioned to you today on the pre show

50:49.460 --> 50:54.420
I was just digging around for stories for tech talk, and I just kept coming up with all these various outlets

50:54.620 --> 50:57.060
They're not even really attached to the Linux or the open source community

50:57.320 --> 51:02.220
Necessarily talking about it like for example the one that stood out with me this morning was I was going over some Bitcoin headlines

51:02.220 --> 51:05.900
And one of the top Bitcoin headlines one of the top stories in Bitcoin today

51:06.060 --> 51:10.220
Was the launch of the Ubuntu touch phone and if there was a Bitcoin wallet available for it?

51:11.340 --> 51:15.900
Like it's not interesting to just see how it permeates it seems to reach out to a level of consumers

51:15.900 --> 51:21.300
It's not like Apple or Microsoft level of reach, but it seems like a wider reach than pretty much

51:21.300 --> 51:25.980
Anybody else in the Linux space gets and I've seen a lot more people talking about Ubuntu touch than I would have expected I

51:26.580 --> 51:28.980
Think partly the fact that it's that

51:29.740 --> 51:32.900
Real Linux device you know yeah, I know

51:33.420 --> 51:35.420
Android is Linux at heart really

51:35.700 --> 51:41.900
But it is a real Linux device in that you know you can SSH into it and do all the kinds of stupid

51:41.900 --> 51:48.220
stuff that you would do on a normal Linux machine and and that actually enables quite a lot of creativity for

51:48.460 --> 51:54.420
In terms of what you want to run on the device and and you talking about the Bitcoin wallet

51:54.420 --> 52:00.380
There is a Bitcoin wallet in the store, and it's been in the store for a long long time about 18 months. It's been there

52:01.900 --> 52:05.540
Central place I can go to find all the apps available for my Ubuntu phone

52:06.060 --> 52:11.060
There is we we haven't made a web front end yet, but someone in the community

52:11.060 --> 52:14.620
Looked at our store API and built one for us

52:14.900 --> 52:17.900
So there is one and you can go to it

52:17.900 --> 52:21.620
And I'll give you the link and you can put it in the show notes and you can browse the apps that are in the

52:21.620 --> 52:25.580
Store and you can see the ratings and all the kinds of stuff that you would see on like iTunes

52:27.100 --> 52:29.100
Q5 you had a question right

52:29.260 --> 52:34.460
Yeah, now I'm gonna frame this poppy and that let's say this Ubuntu phone is incredibly successful

52:34.460 --> 52:35.800
We're five years down the road

52:35.800 --> 52:41.820
There's multiple devices out there my question has to do with that because one thing I've noticed with Android devices is you buy a

52:41.820 --> 52:48.720
Device you load it up with apps everything runs great a couple years go by even though the you know your hardware is the same

52:48.860 --> 52:55.740
The apps run like poo because of the automatic updates the programmers the developers of the applications are now building them for

52:55.740 --> 53:00.420
the newer hardware which then doesn't run on what you have and I'm wondering if as

53:00.420 --> 53:06.820
You know Ubuntu has you know older software updates for older repos if there's gonna be something similar on the phone side of things

53:07.020 --> 53:09.020
so that if you get a phone

53:09.060 --> 53:12.500
you don't have to worry about a semi planned obsolescence because

53:12.900 --> 53:17.500
Applications are being updated and basically update to the point where your hardware can't run them anymore

53:18.300 --> 53:21.380
So it's a it's a great question. I've been bitten by that myself

53:21.380 --> 53:25.420
I have an iPad first generation and there's half a dozen apps on there

53:25.420 --> 53:30.700
I just cannot run anymore because when I first run them they say you need to update me and when you try and update them

53:30.700 --> 53:33.460
It says oh you need iOS 7 or you need iOS 8 or something?

53:33.460 --> 53:35.460
And so yeah, I can appreciate that problem

53:35.700 --> 53:36.900
one of the

53:36.900 --> 53:39.780
One of the issues that there's a few issues one is you know

53:39.780 --> 53:45.260
We can't necessarily control what app developers do if they won't if they see a new

53:46.140 --> 53:49.140
device that comes on the market that has a 4k screen and

53:50.540 --> 53:52.540
128 gig of storage and

53:52.540 --> 53:57.580
16 core CPU and they want to do something amazing with that whatever it might be

53:57.580 --> 54:02.380
Let's say they make the most amazing touchscreen video editor on Linux on a phone

54:02.500 --> 54:08.760
that's got that kind of specs then yeah, I would expect that to run like a pig on the BQ device because this is a

54:09.380 --> 54:16.260
960 by 440 display with a few cores and 1 gig of RAM so that you're gonna have a bad time and I don't

54:16.260 --> 54:20.980
Think that's our you know department to start telling app developers. No, no, no, no

54:20.980 --> 54:27.860
You need to write your your apps as if you're running motif on you know on a Pentium 200 in order to you know

54:27.860 --> 54:33.380
Come into our app store. I don't think that's what she we should be doing. We should foster innovation and you know, the

54:34.060 --> 54:38.120
Advancement of more complex and fun and interactive and useful applications on the device

54:38.120 --> 54:40.740
I don't think we should bring them in in terms of the platform

54:40.780 --> 54:43.460
We are trying to keep our platform as lean as possible

54:43.460 --> 54:46.160
And as I said before having this as our first device

54:46.160 --> 54:50.840
Helps us to get to that goal because we've committed to continue to maintain this

54:51.840 --> 54:56.000
Device, it's not like I'm not trying to throw stones but with the

54:56.720 --> 55:03.080
Firefox OS first phone that I bought the ZTE open. There's no updates for it. Whereas the Firefox flame

55:03.080 --> 55:05.800
I can move to Firefox OS 2.0

55:05.960 --> 55:10.240
But I have no way of doing that that I'm aware of on the ZTE open and we don't want to be in that situation

55:10.240 --> 55:12.240
Where we leave devices behind

55:12.240 --> 55:17.560
You know, my question wasn't are you going to force developers to you know, maintain

55:18.360 --> 55:20.160
You know like you can't

55:20.160 --> 55:26.520
Do anything newer on your programs because of older devices what I'm specifically asking is will there be a way unlike for instance the Google

55:26.520 --> 55:28.920
Play Store where once an application is updated

55:28.920 --> 55:35.120
You do not have the option to reuse the older version if your phone auto updated unless you can somewhere find

55:35.320 --> 55:40.160
The APK online to be able to sideload it like will write when an application is updated

55:40.160 --> 55:46.400
Will the original older version still be available for those who don't have the money to go out and buy that new 4k?

55:46.400 --> 55:51.760
Yeah, that's a good question actually and we're working on the best way to do that

55:51.760 --> 55:52.060
Yeah

55:52.060 --> 55:54.060
whether we whether we need to support having

55:54.440 --> 56:01.340
multiple different versions of the same app in the store to support different versions of the framework of different versions of the

56:02.220 --> 56:05.440
Devices that we've got out in in, you know consumer land

56:05.440 --> 56:10.920
we haven't got a solution for that at the moment my workaround is that I

56:11.240 --> 56:14.080
Personally mirror all of the clicks in the store every single day

56:14.080 --> 56:18.420
So I have a copy of every version of every app that's in the store on my home server

56:18.640 --> 56:22.720
You know, that's my personal way of doing it. But yeah, you you

56:25.280 --> 56:27.700
You might be able to manually back up those click packages

56:29.160 --> 56:33.760
Yeah, I mean if I wanted the old version of telegram for some reason I could maybe somehow keep that

56:33.760 --> 56:39.720
I mean, it's you could we've got the tools you can you can get a click package and you can side load it over a

56:39.720 --> 56:42.080
USB cable and just type a command and it installs it

56:42.080 --> 56:46.400
You know, I I have done that today installed loads of because I wanted to test the upgrade process

56:46.400 --> 56:50.080
I installed a load of old apps on the phone and then went through the upgrade process

56:50.080 --> 56:52.400
So yeah, you can do that kind of thing

56:52.400 --> 56:57.820
We do make it possible for you to side load old versions of stuff. Is that something that canonical will try?

56:57.920 --> 57:03.020
Well, would they have a problem if someone in the community took up that role of hosting all the older versions?

57:03.020 --> 57:04.960
Or would they be okay with that?

57:04.960 --> 57:08.360
well, we got to remember is that the packages in the store are

57:09.440 --> 57:15.340
Licensed under certain terms and they're not necessarily all GPL the developers. Yes some of them

57:15.880 --> 57:18.580
Yeah, it's up to them whether their apps are you know?

57:19.200 --> 57:23.960
Distributable redistributable or not, you know that and now it's something you would have to check, you know

57:23.960 --> 57:30.140
There's actually some some decent apps that I use like readability and instant. There's an instant paper web app in here

57:30.140 --> 57:33.420
There's a rotten tomatoes. I mean some of these are web apps to be sure but hey

57:33.420 --> 57:36.500
You know web apps fine as long as it takes me right to it for the most part

57:36.500 --> 57:39.020
I don't need things to be native for like rotten tomatoes

57:39.980 --> 57:42.020
Right, and there's a few games, you know

57:42.020 --> 57:44.780
We need I I would love for there to be more games on there because you know

57:44.780 --> 57:49.200
I'm the same as anyone I sit there and when I'm bored, I pick up my phone and start playing stupid games

57:49.200 --> 57:53.340
There's a couple of really good ones. There's one called machines versus machines, which is a really nice

57:53.340 --> 58:01.580
desktop tower defense game which is infuriating and I'm almost a hundred percent certain canonical have lost a lot of productivity over the

58:01.580 --> 58:03.580
last

58:04.340 --> 58:08.380
Game in there. I like this a lot. This is really neat

58:08.380 --> 58:12.060
It is that I'll have a link to this app store website me pulling in the reviews here

58:12.060 --> 58:15.700
This is really tiny tiny RSS app. Very nice. Oh, very cool

58:15.700 --> 58:19.060
Yeah, I mean the nice thing that that store nobody asked him to do that

58:19.060 --> 58:26.300
he just noticed that we had a well-documented API for the store and so he created his own his own web front-end and

58:27.220 --> 58:31.580
Put it on github. So anyone can can can do that. I've noticed a couple of other

58:32.580 --> 58:34.580
Questions in the IRC. Yeah

58:34.900 --> 58:40.020
So and I go go says is there tethering the answer is yes and no there isn't a gooey for at the moment

58:40.060 --> 58:44.020
But I think it is possible with a couple of commands. You can tether to the device

58:44.020 --> 58:49.540
And we do plan to have it so that you can press buttons in order to tether in the same way

58:49.540 --> 58:53.660
You would expect to do that on other devices. And the other question is is there a mobile terminal? Yes

58:53.660 --> 58:55.540
Yes, of course there is

58:55.540 --> 58:57.540
so it seems like

58:58.180 --> 59:00.960
For a lot of us the selection of apps won't be a big deal

59:00.960 --> 59:06.780
But for the average consumer like, you know, an audible app is kind of important maybe ways or something like that

59:06.940 --> 59:11.500
That's gonna be the big fight, but I guess that only gets solved after some hardware has been on the market for a little while

59:11.500 --> 59:18.340
Right. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. And once you've got a couple of those out there and you can go to places like MWC or

59:18.860 --> 59:24.500
GDC or you know any of the conferences over the next six months and start waving the device around and say look, you know

59:24.500 --> 59:25.860
We've got this

59:25.860 --> 59:30.700
open hardware open platform with you know hardware in the in the market and you know

59:30.700 --> 59:36.420
Here's our SDK and here are people who've developed apps and here's a selection of code that you could look at to show you

59:36.420 --> 59:38.940
How to develop your own apps, maybe we can get people ported

59:38.940 --> 59:41.540
I mean, I I thought I understood the difference

59:41.540 --> 59:45.420
I thought I understood what a scope was but I got to tell you some of these apps in here that are called scopes

59:45.420 --> 59:50.340
Look like apps. I don't know. It's like this gmail scope looks like an app to me, but this is just a scope

59:50.340 --> 59:55.700
Right. What does that mean? Yeah, so so the scopes are away, you know when you showed that video earlier

59:55.700 --> 59:59.300
Yeah, the the people in the video were just looking at scopes. They were just

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:04.660
Take the phone out of the pocket and swipe to one side, right? You just swipe across check what the weather's like

01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:05.940
It's all about

01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:11.980
Specific information at your fingertips right kind of like right and think I've explained is Google now without the creepy

01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:15.860
And the rituals you do every day like, you know

01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:20.020
You check what the weather's gonna be like before you get before you get up you you know, you might

01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:24.740
See what appointments you have that day to see whether you need to wear a suit or we can dress down

01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:31.420
So you check your calendar and you all these kind of little things that ordinarily might be siloed away in lots of different applications

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:36.380
Like I have to open the weather app or I have to open my calendar app, right? I have to go and check my email app

01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:41.380
And and rather than you have to open each of these apps one after the other that information is pushed to the front screen

01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:45.780
So it's just a case of swipe swipe swipe and you see that information right there

01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:48.980
I think that's that's the key goal is and that's where the whole you know

01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:53.180
Your information at your fingertips is just a quick swipe away

01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:58.740
Big deep in that isn't that what isn't that canonical saying in a way and they're not saying it's bad thing

01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:00.740
But isn't that canonical in a way saying you know what?

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:05.660
Guys some stuff doesn't need to be an app your your stuff is is a feature

01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:08.340
It's not it's not a dedicated app. Just write a scope

01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:11.860
It kind of feels like a little bit like saying to developers. Sorry your app

01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:16.900
I know you want to brand it you want to have a yahoo weather app and you want to give everybody the yahoo weather experience

01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:21.300
But really people just wanna know if it's gonna rain that she could just be in a scope. Is that kind of the message?

01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:22.060
Yeah

01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:26.760
Do you think you know especially is and you can aggregate data from multiple scopes?

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:30.740
so, you know, I could say well, I I like the the

01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:36.340
Weather reports I get from yahoo and I like the weather reports I get from the weather channel

01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:38.840
But I also like knowing how windy it's gonna be

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:43.100
So there's this where this website where I go to find out what the winds gonna be like

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:47.700
So when I go surfing, you know, I have a better idea and yahoo don't show me that kind of data

01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:50.860
So it's nice to be able to aggregate all of that kind of information

01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:56.620
So you can get multiple perspectives on the same piece of data if that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah, I do like that

01:01:56.620 --> 01:01:58.700
You get you can get alternative opinions

01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:04.460
And of course one thing you'd the first app you'd want to get for your Ubuntu touch device is the jupiter broadcasting app

01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:06.140
Well, of course, obviously

01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:08.920
Which is pretty cool and it actually resizes pretty well, too

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:13.620
I think this is and this app this app is really well done the authors put

01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:18.260
You know the host information right there and it's just a really well done app. It's really cool

01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:21.260
It's it's one of the it's I think one of our best mobile apps out there

01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:25.480
Of course, I love all our mobile apps, but I think it's one of our best on and it's on Ubuntu touch right now

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:31.180
So the author of that Simon was actually one of the insiders. We invited him along

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:35.180
so he's one of the people who got invited last Friday to come along and get a

01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:37.700
Phone and the headphones and all that

01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:44.920
Kind of thank you for yeah, I'm glad because I know working with him on that app

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:48.180
He was super excited about the platform or he is super excited about the platform

01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:52.340
So yeah, and and the other nice thing is what we've said to all these people who came along last Friday

01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:54.340
It's important to know that they're all they're not all

01:02:54.340 --> 01:03:00.860
Yes, men, they're not all people who we've said you must say positive things about Ubuntu. We've given them the phone

01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:03.360
They can say whatever they like, you know, we've had people

01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:09.440
Posting YouTube videos telling us that the boot performance is bad. Yeah, telling us that the scrolling performance is bad

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:15.780
That's exactly what we want. We want them to tell us their experience not tell us only the positive things

01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:19.620
Tell us what's wrong with it as well. You gotta fix that stuff too. Yeah, exactly. That's good

01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:22.980
That's a good outlook to have about it. I think I I

01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:24.980
I wonder if

01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:28.540
You know if I even like a podcast app could be a scope thing

01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:32.100
I mean, that's a fascinating thing that I think I want to play with more as I get the device and I wonder if I

01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:37.500
Well, yeah, there is a jet. There is a generic cast app that's written by Mike Sheldon

01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:41.340
He's one of the one of our employees. Is that the bird on screen keyboard?

01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:45.740
Is that popular? Yeah, and I think he's looking at developing a scope as well

01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:48.580
So you could just scroll across like first thing in the morning on your commute

01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:53.300
You just scroll across to your podcast scope and it lists all the you know

01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:57.540
Upcoming episodes or what's new in the book and you can just hit the button and make play

01:03:57.580 --> 01:04:00.980
Rather than having to go screwing around with your podcast. Yeah, so

01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:04.960
The other thing I think of is and then I'm then I'm then all my questions are done and we can

01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:10.040
Wrap up but anyways people are sick of hearing about it. Yeah

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:16.300
One of the things like I know whenever we're writing apps for platforms is what kind of what kind of features is the platform?

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:18.740
Just gonna give me for free. Can it just do video playback?

01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:20.460
Like if I just say put a video element here

01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:23.100
We'll just do video playback or do I have to write the player?

01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:27.660
Figure out how I'm gonna pull down the mp4 file figure out how I'm gonna break that up and play to the user

01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:32.380
Especially when I'm moving on connections, is there like, you know, like on iOS there's like a core video

01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:35.300
I'm a core is there anything like that on a bunch of touch yet? Or is that in development?

01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:40.620
Yeah, there is so we have a bunch of core services that the platform provides. So for example

01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:46.700
For example, there's location services so that if you develop a map app, you just request the location and

01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:53.420
The user gets prompted to say do you want this app to know your location and you accept or deny and yeah

01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:59.700
Then you're done and the app can then find out your location and that that location detection is provided by our location service

01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:03.740
Similarly if you if you're writing a podcast app and you want to be able to download

01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:07.900
You know video podcasts that take a very long time to download

01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:09.900
you can

01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:11.260
Use the download service

01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:14.260
so when you choose to when the developer chooses to download a

01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:19.860
Long video podcast it downloads in the background and then when it finishes it signals to the app that it's done

01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:26.060
What was the other one? Oh media playback. So yeah, we have a media hub, which does audio playback

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:30.900
We have video playback as well. And we also have a media scanner service

01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:32.580
So if you put your music on the device

01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:37.980
It will scan all your music figure out what the ID three tags are go and get the artwork all that kind of stuff as well

01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:41.500
Oh, that's really cool. And then last but not least how much do you want?

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:44.000
One of these cases that has the cutout for the notification thing

01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:47.060
That is really cool. No idea that thing existed

01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:52.300
It turns out the BQ guy who was at the thing last Friday had one and I just didn't notice it

01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:58.940
He yeah, you touch phone gets its own exclusive phone case with a custom cutout for that little notification ring

01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:01.300
That's how sweet is that? That's really cool

01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:06.620
That's awesome. That is neat. All right. Anybody the mum broom have any questions for Pope before we wrap up on the

01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:11.380
Idea, okay. Go ahead. W. Popey. You can answer not answer. It's totally up to you

01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:13.540
Okay

01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:18.920
My questions are if we import this to the US if like one of us decides to

01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:23.660
would I be able to like put it on Tang or some other mobile network and

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:30.420
how good is like the Wi-Fi on this if let's say I just don't want to use a mobile network and

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:34.500
Just use it on Wi-Fi just to contact people online

01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:40.220
So you could you could get it shipped to the US and in fact, we have some of our employees

01:06:40.220 --> 01:06:42.220
Who are in the US who use it?

01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:48.060
The downside is because the US uses different frequencies for 3G. You'd only get

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:51.500
GSM 2G

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:54.500
It does have Wi-Fi. So yes, it'll do

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:59.740
2.4 I think and 5 gig like I'd have to check that but

01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:06.820
Yeah, it does. It does Wi-Fi perfectly. I I mine mine is mostly on my my Wi-Fi. Actually, I think it's only 2.4

01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:10.220
Yeah, it doesn't do 5g. It's 2.4. Okay, so

01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:14.740
Yeah, that's not too uncommon when you're bringing a phone over kind of depends on what bands are in it

01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:17.820
I didn't last yeah, it's a bit of a bummer. You know, we get

01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:22.180
Unfortunately, it's um, it's it's a bit out of our control

01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:24.180
Okay, I had one last question

01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:31.020
Could you do you have any insights to share about the integrated traffic data service that's going to be shipping with the phones in the UK?

01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:35.820
And is that something we're gonna see more of where maybe canonical has a bit of a hole in in

01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:41.700
Something the phone does that maybe some of the shipping ones already do and so instead you just partner with somebody who does that like

01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:47.860
Like Ironix here with the traffic data. Can you you know, you know, I I learn about that from OMG

01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:53.020
I'm too so Joey who runs OMG a bunch who came last Friday as well and you know, he writes a blog post or

01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:57.420
Tweets about something I think oh, that's cool. I didn't know we did that. Yeah, so

01:07:58.020 --> 01:08:01.020
These insiders are not just you know, I don't know

01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:03.980
Maybe there was an ounce with I missed because we've all been heads down for the phone

01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:09.540
Yeah, they say they say it's a partnership with I in our X to do or I and Rick's or whatever to do the traffic

01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:12.220
And I think that when I saw that I was like that seems like hey, you know what?

01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:14.580
We have a gap here and we can plug it with a partnership

01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:19.820
It makes sense to me right and that's exactly what we did for the location services. So we you know, how

01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:22.340
Android have Google have their own

01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:30.380
Location services and Apple have their own location services. We partnered with Nokia here for our location services

01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:34.980
So they provided some software to us that allows us to do the fast fix

01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:41.220
Location detection so that it does a GPS when you're you know, when you're out and about near Wi-Fi access points

01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:45.700
It can find you pretty quickly without that. It would take a long time to get a GPS lock. It's

01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:50.260
Painfully long so we partnered with them. So yeah, there is a there is a precedent for us

01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:53.820
Partnering with other companies to provide services for the phone. Hmm

01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:57.900
Okay, any last questions for mr. Pope before we wrap this thing up. I

01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:01.060
Think you just saw he sold me on it

01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:04.660
Yeah, oh and we have a torch app. So, you know

01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:08.620
That base is covered as well. Yes, gotta gotta be able to make sure I can

01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:14.100
Find my way in the dark. Yeah, so very cool and exciting to see an actual ship date. So tomorrow's the day

01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:17.420
Yep

01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:21.420
Oh my gosh, oh, oh really so then there'll be another so there's gonna be another one later

01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:26.500
Maybe yeah want I got to figure out what those times are Pacific time

01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:28.580
And I'm gonna set an alarm and I want to try to get one. I

01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:35.780
Mean seems like we've all been waiting for so long, right and it's not it's under $200. So it's a pretty good deal

01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:40.780
Yeah, it's it's pretty cheap really, you know 126 pounds. What is it 169 euros?

01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:44.500
I don't know what I is in funny money you have over there. Yeah, it's not it's not

01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:48.100
Expensive. No, it's pretty cool to see it actually come to fruition

01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:54.100
All right. Well, I think we'll wrap it up right there and if I get one eventually

01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:56.620
I'll give you a review

01:09:56.620 --> 01:10:00.660
However, it is and I'll watch it as it goes like I kind of other reason I kind of want to beat you so I

01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:03.540
Can get the you know, I can get updates and kind of track the price of the phone

01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:07.940
So I can get the you know, I can get updates and kind of track the progress as the platform matures because there's gonna be things

01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:11.340
It'll be pushed out as you know, they find stuff and it'd be good to keep track of that

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:17.380
So very true. I'll give you a report next week. If I managed to grab one. It's already tomorrow here says Juba in the chat room

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:22.100
Well, that's true. That's a little confusing and the people could be listening at any time. We're talking to people in the future

01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:26.140
I mean, how cool is that? We're time travelers. That's right. We're time travelers. We'll put Rogers

01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:31.220
Thank you for letting us pick your brain all that. Yeah, it was a it was a good download of information

01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:38.140
Yeah, thank you. Cheers guys. Yeah, congratulations to you and everybody over there to cannot seem for working your asses off to get this far

01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:42.580
I think if nothing else, that's a hell of an accomplishment and just right there. All right

01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:46.540
Well, then we'll wrap it up here on the Linux unplugged show. We'd love to have you visit us

01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:51.140
Why don't you join us? You know, you could do this with us. Yeah, you could come over to the website Tuesdays

01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:52.100
We start at 2 p.m

01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:57.420
Pacific you go to Jupiter broadcasting comm slash counter to get that in your local time zone and join us in that there IRC

01:10:57.420 --> 01:11:01.340
Chat room share your opinions as we go or even better join us in the mobile room

01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:05.120
maybe we can hear you and what you actually think about these things because I think

01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:10.700
We have a pretty smart audience. You probably have a pretty educated opinion on a lot of this stuff. Why not contribute?

01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:15.980
We're just gonna check your mic. You can also go to Linux action show dot reddit.com and submit content that way Matt

01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:20.780
Have a great week. I'll talk to you next week. Sounds good. See you then. All right, everybody

01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:27.820
Thanks so much for to this week's episode of Linux unplugged. We'll see you right back here next Tuesday

01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:52.780
Okay, I've got a

01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:10.900
$10,000 ethernet cable to sell you. Are you ready for this for a $10,000 internet cable? Yeah, let me get my checkbook

01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:12.620
Now here's the good thing Matt

01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:15.780
If you if you're willing to pay ten thousand dollars for this ethernet cable

01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:21.620
Not only am I gonna include data in this ethernet cable, but for no additional charge on top of the 10,000

01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:27.380
I'm also gonna give you high fidelity audio. Hmm. No, I just better be a unidirectional one

01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:29.380
Cuz I don't want any of your cheap bi-directional

01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:35.940
Now that I've got you interested I should probably disclaim it's actually ten thousand five hundred dollars for this cable

01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:42.100
It's got an RJ 45 connector made from silver with tabs that are virtually unbreakable

01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:46.900
The plug comes with the added strain relief and a firm lock to keep it in place that way

01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:52.260
No critical data is lost silver, huh? I'm gonna wager. This is put out by monster. I'm just call that a hunch

01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:57.860
You know what they're doing all this crap. Oh my gosh makes it sound better. Wow

01:12:57.860 --> 01:13:02.420
It does look amazing though. This does look like that. It's got a really cool braided cable, too

01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:08.140
This is the coolest looking HD or ethernet cable. I've ever seen I'd probably wear it like mr. T. I'll be honest with you

01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:12.860
Audio quest diamond. Yeah, you could it would be a piece of jewelry. All right, JB titles calm

01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:17.180
Yeah, I have a feeling it's gonna be something to do with the Ubuntu phone. I don't know could be yeah

01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:23.740
Yeah, so, you know how you know how I talk about Chrome and how I like Chrome. Oh, you're a Chrome maniac

01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:30.780
Yeah, so over the weekend my Chrome profile just got corrupted for some reason and now every time I launch Chrome

01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:33.500
it thinks it's launched for the first time ever which

01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:40.140
It's not like an unusable because it sinks so well and so fast that all of my stuff sinks back

01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:43.680
but the one thing I really end up missing is my URL

01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:50.840
Autocompletion and the reason why that's handy is turns out like I need to type while I'm doing a podcast often and it's really nice

01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:56.500
If I could just type in JB T and then JB titles is automatically and I just enter so that way I don't otherwise

01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:58.500
I'm over here going like hey, welcome to

01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:00.500
Hold on. I got it

01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:06.580
Hold on. I'm typing. All right. Welcome to the show. No, did you not restore your Chrome profile from your backup?

01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:09.180
my what

01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:13.260
Well, it's a fun trick that I've used I've never done this on chroma

01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:17.460
I used to do it in Firefox a lot and I keep like multiple I I create when I

01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:22.980
Profile. Yeah, and then I got all my autocompletes done and then I move them away and that way when it goes to crap and it

01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:24.980
Will there you go?

01:14:24.980 --> 01:14:31.420
I'm paranoid now. We're tinfoil hats. Ubuntu is calling is not bad. Ubuntu phones arrivals also pretty good

01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:36.340
I like both of those. I like Ubuntu calling. It's cool. Ubuntu is calling

01:14:36.980 --> 01:14:41.980
Very Avon. It's kind of working for me the Ubuntu blob phone. Oh my gosh. It's already starting

01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:53.740
Yep, yep, ahoy Ubuntu. All right, JBtitles.com suck my googs. No, I suck my googs. Oh boy

01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:59.020
Yeah, and I just got that out of my brain too. Oh, right. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, man

01:14:59.020 --> 01:15:05.300
You guys hey might as well my you know what we started with it. We might as well end with it, right?

01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:07.820
Yeah, it's the circle. It's the circle of life

01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:23.820
Circle of googs
