WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.840
Is anybody in here running any docker images in the mumble room?

00:05.400 --> 00:07.400
Anybody use docker?

00:10.320 --> 00:12.640
Well, I think docker is getting pretty popular

00:12.640 --> 00:13.440
Yeah

00:13.440 --> 00:17.600
And I'm worried that we are creating ourselves a bit of a long-term problem with docker

00:17.880 --> 00:21.920
They could give us a bit of a bad name and the BSD guys are gonna give us a hard time about it

00:21.920 --> 00:24.300
We got to get our act together when it comes to docker containers

00:24.300 --> 00:26.300
So a study was just done recently

00:26.300 --> 00:32.440
Showing that over 30% of official docker images in the docker hub contain high priority security vulnerabilities

00:33.220 --> 00:35.020
Honestly, what did you expect?

00:35.020 --> 00:42.260
So what I mean really what did you expect? I mean that is the fundamental trade-off either we have everything is linked

00:42.260 --> 00:46.820
So you have the binary and that links to all these libraries and those libraries are dynamically updated which let's face it in practice

00:47.020 --> 00:52.780
Never works. Well, it well, I wouldn't say never okay fine. I mean it almost never work. I don't know

00:52.780 --> 00:55.020
I think that's a little harsh. It's not harsh eventually

00:55.020 --> 00:57.300
It will cause a problem eventually usually causes a problem

00:57.300 --> 00:58.220
But if you think about it

00:58.220 --> 01:01.900
That is that problem happens the minority of the time because your system works the majority of the time

01:01.900 --> 01:05.500
That's true. So so in the grand scheme of things, I agree with you

01:05.500 --> 01:07.340
However, yeah from the I follow what you say

01:07.340 --> 01:12.140
But it comes to like if you need that one piece of software that one piece of software doesn't work and I have been bitten

01:12.140 --> 01:17.060
By this so many times that I I admit that I am I am like I'm overly sensitive to the issue

01:17.060 --> 01:17.340
Yeah

01:17.340 --> 01:20.540
But well and you're working at it from an enterprise angle to where it's much more of an issue

01:20.540 --> 01:24.620
Right because these companies like I said, they release cut they release software for one version of Linux

01:24.620 --> 01:25.340
Oh, here's the issue though

01:25.340 --> 01:31.700
I mean, yeah, I guess it's not that surprising but we're talking things like these Docker containers are vulnerable to shell shock heart bleed poodle

01:31.700 --> 01:32.500
Etc

01:32.500 --> 01:36.420
And then images published by Docker users not explicitly verified by any authority

01:36.420 --> 01:42.060
Like if you just go to like the general images in the Docker hub, it goes up to 40% of the images having serious

01:42.700 --> 01:45.380
security vulnerabilities over 40% and

01:46.100 --> 01:48.100
a lot of them are old

01:48.140 --> 01:51.180
Mercurial when you look at the official images is the number one source of

01:51.180 --> 01:56.020
Vulnerabilities, but of course when you look at community images ones that are not from the official hub

01:56.020 --> 01:58.400
Then the vulnerabilities primarily come from bash

01:58.900 --> 02:00.960
apt open SSL

02:01.740 --> 02:06.660
File bin utils mercurial rpm like, you know the basic stuff sequel pseudo

02:07.580 --> 02:11.860
HTTP W get like these things are just not getting patched and they're getting these weird vulnerabilities

02:11.860 --> 02:18.660
So now I think you're being too harsh. Really? Well, here's this look at this. Okay, but the numbers Noah are are disgraceful

02:18.660 --> 02:23.700
I mean, we're talking we're talking really well known vulnerabilities that have been taken care of we're talking it

02:23.700 --> 02:27.940
We're talking like you put this stuff into production unless you have taken serious mitigation steps

02:28.740 --> 02:33.860
40% of these images created by the community have critical vulnerabilities and by the way, dude

02:33.860 --> 02:38.620
if you drop from critical down to medium vulnerabilities and you include everything rated as medium then

02:39.620 --> 02:44.740
70% of the images have vulnerabilities. Yeah, but so let's start with this you start with a

02:44.740 --> 02:49.540
Technology that is relatively new right Docker has not been around a terribly long time

02:49.540 --> 02:54.340
He is still they I mean that you people granted people were putting into production before Docker even said

02:56.540 --> 02:59.140
But the reality is it was just last year

02:59.140 --> 03:01.620
I think it was that self when the guy came out and said alright

03:01.620 --> 03:04.740
We've actually fully we actually now support you to put this into production

03:04.740 --> 03:09.740
Yeah, not like it's been out that long to begin with second of all, they're doing something relatively groundbreaking

03:09.740 --> 03:17.460
Runbreaking from the standpoint that we don't really have any sort of cross-platform container that can you know cross distro cross?

03:17.460 --> 03:20.060
Yeah, that's true. Okay, so then you have that working for you

03:20.060 --> 03:25.100
Then add to that the fact that the people that are doing this the people that are smart enough and the people that have the

03:25.100 --> 03:27.220
Resource to do this have other things to do

03:27.380 --> 03:33.180
So they might be able to create this Docker container, but the ability to sit there and maintain it and update it constantly

03:33.180 --> 03:37.480
Yeah, I think I better things to do right? Well, so Corky you think this is just fundamentally

03:37.480 --> 03:40.560
The flaw with having a Docker hub

03:41.600 --> 03:43.560
Well, I don't think we really need it

03:43.560 --> 03:50.360
the whole point of having a hub is to replace what official package repositories if we just

03:50.640 --> 03:58.480
Did what the rocket project is really about just taking the container and then sticking it in package repos

03:58.600 --> 04:02.920
such as the Ubuntu repos or the arch repos and have people

04:03.360 --> 04:05.360
install and

04:05.360 --> 04:07.360
it use

04:07.640 --> 04:14.800
Docker containers from official package repositories, would this be a big issue? That's an interesting approach, you know

04:14.800 --> 04:16.720
I was gonna argue with you. You're right

04:16.720 --> 04:20.880
I mean, I guess you could take the rocket approach and that that and do it at the distro level

04:20.880 --> 04:26.640
I wanted to back up and say is doesn't this actually justify the need of a hub because here's a different approach

04:27.320 --> 04:28.920
What if okay?

04:28.920 --> 04:34.520
So what these guys are doing this this guy at Banny Ops that wrote up the post is they're doing a analysis of the code

04:34.520 --> 04:40.520
They're scanning it. They're checking out these images. They're running a vulnerability assessments against them and they're creating like Nessus reports

04:40.520 --> 04:42.520
or whatever the hell they're using

04:42.560 --> 04:47.920
Somebody at the Docker company could just as easily do this Docker could automate this process

04:48.120 --> 04:52.560
Docker could automate the flagging of images that have known vulnerabilities. It could even rate them with scores

04:52.560 --> 04:54.560
They can say this one is had high vulnerabilities

04:54.560 --> 04:59.680
Docker could do all of this and they could add that as a value add to the Docker hub because I I think there is

04:59.680 --> 05:02.400
A place in the market for the Docker hub, you know, we were talking about

05:02.400 --> 05:06.880
This new that new office suite that's going to be server-side Google Docs competitor

05:06.880 --> 05:11.800
And they're bringing it to Linux for the first time and they're off their option for distribution when they come to Linux for the first

05:11.800 --> 05:18.560
Time is a Docker image because they can wrap their heads around a centralized repository that distributes these Docker containers down to end-users

05:18.600 --> 05:22.120
For server just for server software for server software deployment

05:22.680 --> 05:26.520
It does make some sense have one spot to go for all Linux distros

05:26.520 --> 05:27.600
I don't know if I wanted to be Docker

05:27.600 --> 05:29.440
I don't know if I wanted to be owned by a company

05:29.440 --> 05:34.320
But I think it's interesting to give the market a chance to play this out because you could see a value add by doing that

05:34.320 --> 05:38.800
Automated vulnerability assessment automated checking rating things, you know Docker could staff that up

05:39.280 --> 05:44.320
Almost treat it like App Store reviews without all the dickishness of it and make sure people know

05:44.960 --> 05:51.280
Right now though and almost feel like Docker is being negligent in this matter because these are on their platform because these are being offered

05:51.280 --> 05:55.800
Up to their end-users. Is it not the responsibility to make sure I guess how far do you take it?

05:55.800 --> 05:59.480
Because if you say it's Docker's responsibility to make sure that these things don't have vulnerabilities

05:59.480 --> 06:03.560
Then isn't it also Docker's responsibility to make sure they don't have backdoors or rootkits, right?

06:03.560 --> 06:08.360
I mean, I wouldn't say that what I would say is it's Docker's responsibility if they're going to have a central hub

06:09.480 --> 06:17.020
To give an interface that will allow people to to communicate what they like and what they don't like so take Torrance

06:17.020 --> 06:23.540
For example, right there is a there is a there is a great system in place and it's not mandated by you know

06:23.540 --> 06:26.160
By any user group. It's not mandated by by any committee

06:26.160 --> 06:28.800
But the reality is when you go on to the pirate bay

06:28.800 --> 06:31.460
I can tell you the best torrent to download from the worst

06:32.000 --> 06:38.400
Because that that's all being rated on voted on and if there was some that had that had some some snarky snark

06:38.400 --> 06:39.920
That was connected to that torrent

06:39.920 --> 06:43.000
I would know about that because it would be in the comments or if there's some sort of yeah

06:43.040 --> 06:46.800
So is that really that hard to implement? That's kind of what you're talking about, right?

06:46.800 --> 06:50.280
Yeah, I guess that actually works and even like at the AUR level like I know yeah

06:50.280 --> 06:53.760
Yeah, yeah, I'm going right comments and usually know what's up. Mm-hmm. That's a good point

06:53.760 --> 06:56.080
And I guess that would sort of be a good middle ground for now

06:56.080 --> 07:00.820
And then the other thing is from their perspective all they have to do is provide the infrastructure everything else

07:01.000 --> 07:03.220
It will be provided by the users

07:03.760 --> 07:05.460
Yeah, yeah right now

07:05.460 --> 07:08.720
It's a bit of a it's a bit of a clown show and they need to get it cleaned up

07:08.880 --> 07:13.740
Because it's all happening really fast around them and people aren't gonna take it seriously if it has these kinds of problems

07:13.740 --> 07:17.120
I think and I think you know, there's gonna be competitors out there. They're coming up

07:17.120 --> 07:22.440
I mean canonicals launching their own format. You got obviously the rocket stuff coming out of the core OS project

07:22.440 --> 07:28.000
You got the free BSD guys have had jails and had this fixed up figured out for a really really long time already

07:28.240 --> 07:32.780
Plus they can back it up with a great file system that also provides a lot of advantages in conjunction with jails

07:32.780 --> 07:36.000
Right, and we should just get all that done in just a couple months here. Yeah

07:37.880 --> 07:39.880
Come on I mean like so

07:40.320 --> 07:45.200
July is that about when it came out like officially officially they were yeah when they said

07:45.200 --> 07:49.360
It was when the latest Red Hat Enterprise 7 shipped. Okay, that would have been yeah

07:49.360 --> 07:52.960
So June July somewhere around that was that was and I'm using air quotes here 1-0

07:52.960 --> 07:58.240
Yeah, but 1-0 shipped it shouldn't have been a 1-0, but I think I think they had that new partnership with Red Hat

07:58.240 --> 08:01.600
Yeah, you know Red Hat didn't want to ship a non 1-0 thing in Red Hat Enterprise

08:01.600 --> 08:06.000
And so I think they called it 1.0. Yeah, even though they didn't even have like signing and things like that

08:06.000 --> 08:10.240
Yeah, but yeah, it is new. The thing is the reason but here's what?

08:10.800 --> 08:13.300
Here's where and then we can get off this cuz probably people don't care too much

08:13.300 --> 08:15.520
But I think here's where we would give them a little too much slack

08:16.240 --> 08:21.440
It's new. Mm-hmm, but the technology they're using they didn't invent right?

08:21.440 --> 08:25.120
Yes, they're using kernel features like right the container ization has been around

08:25.120 --> 08:25.680
Oh, yeah

08:25.680 --> 08:30.880
What they invented is the layer that sits on top that does the github like checkout check in the container formats

08:30.880 --> 08:34.800
They came like they the specs they came up with all of that stuff and that's super value-added

08:34.800 --> 08:40.120
That's obviously made a huge difference and cannot be downplayed. But at the same time that's the layer they're working at

08:40.120 --> 08:42.340
I mean obviously they're working with those other layers too because you know

08:42.340 --> 08:44.520
They have coded that layer there there they have interest there, right?

08:44.520 --> 08:48.880
But what I'm trying to say is like this is the area they should be focusing on

08:48.880 --> 08:53.560
This is where their energy should be going. So like there is only so much so much room

08:53.560 --> 08:58.520
I'm willing to give them it's not like they're creating the entire container ization from whole cloth and they have that entire burden

08:58.520 --> 09:02.240
Yeah, so yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. I agree

09:03.160 --> 09:04.640
That's it

09:04.640 --> 09:06.640
Not the trip set or anything. Oh

09:06.640 --> 09:13.080
Also, also why why can I say sorry? Why are people complaining about the pack that?

09:13.840 --> 09:16.780
Containers having vulnerabilities when they can just update them

09:17.880 --> 09:23.640
Vulnerable software in the containers themselves. Yeah, here's the issue and I was just reading I was just reading a blog post about this

09:24.960 --> 09:30.780
Had this, you know, and this is part of what I think gets me a little pissy about this issue. I don't

09:30.780 --> 09:38.580
know if you ever he ever worked with a developer who just really hates the sysadmin like the sysadmin is the guy that slows me down

09:38.860 --> 09:40.820
He's always worried about security permissions

09:40.820 --> 09:45.340
He's always got a firewall rule that I have to go talk to him about guy wants to do updates and it breaks my program

09:45.340 --> 09:51.060
Like they just hate the sysadmin right? Yeah in fairness. A lot of sysadmins hate the developers. Yeah. Yep. Absolutely. All right, and

09:52.380 --> 09:55.060
so one of these guys one of these developers is

09:55.060 --> 10:01.100
Brogging about why docker is so great and it's not because it you know makes it takes care of you know, all the different distros

10:01.100 --> 10:04.380
And it makes a single point of just deploying software through the hub

10:04.380 --> 10:04.980
No, no

10:04.980 --> 10:12.680
The reason why this guy likes docker is because now the sysadmin doesn't screw his stuff up with silly updates and permissions

10:12.680 --> 10:14.980
He just gives the silly sysadmin. He didn't say silly

10:14.980 --> 10:20.260
He just gives the silly sysadmin one file and it's a two-step process to get his creation right up on the server

10:20.260 --> 10:22.820
And then he doesn't in his words mess it up anymore

10:22.820 --> 10:25.500
And the whole idea is and the reason why I'm bringing this up is right

10:26.540 --> 10:30.380
There is a mentality where people are creating docker images and they are creating these things thinking

10:30.460 --> 10:34.580
This is a static world that will never change the world around it is gonna be updated

10:34.580 --> 10:39.660
It's gonna be chaotic libraries gonna change kernels are gonna change whatever but this container everything in this world this Ubuntu

10:39.660 --> 10:45.460
Yeah, 1404 little world in here or 1204 little world here will never ever change. You don't want to know something Chris

10:45.460 --> 10:49.760
I like that. I know but that's an administrator and I like that. That's the problem though

10:49.760 --> 10:55.220
That's because then the things were those processes maybe say like what what do you what for example?

10:55.220 --> 10:58.340
Let's say you put the Zimbra inside a container wouldn't that be you know?

10:58.340 --> 11:02.380
Just get Zimbra in a container and keep it nice and contained on it on a CentOS box

11:02.460 --> 11:05.300
The problem is what if in that container?

11:05.700 --> 11:11.700
Zimbra is using a version of IMAP that gets to be a year old or so that has another heart bleed like vulnerability in right?

11:11.780 --> 11:16.020
Well, then you have to go update that container to get rid of that vulnerability

11:16.020 --> 11:20.940
But now you are doing something that was against the original design of the people that distributed that container

11:20.940 --> 11:25.780
So your only option at that point is to essentially and I might have this wrong, but I believe the container

11:25.780 --> 11:28.380
Well, you you yeah, you essentially not this is the right wrong word

11:28.380 --> 11:33.060
But you essentially like fork the container you copy it and now begin running your own version of you maintain separately

11:33.060 --> 11:34.700
Right than the one that comes from Docker Hub, right?

11:34.700 --> 11:39.540
So there are a couple things one is I would rather have an insecure program than no program

11:39.660 --> 11:42.580
So if my choices are to run something insecure

11:42.580 --> 11:46.700
Are you sure like are you sure like in the in like, you know, like something that could be really bad like that

11:46.700 --> 11:49.300
You know where people can read the memory on your server and stuff like that

11:49.300 --> 11:55.260
I'm I go back to to to a client I had and this was not all that terribly long goes in fact one of the first

11:55.260 --> 11:59.400
things I it's I we had set up them up with the system 76 computer and the

11:59.620 --> 12:03.740
the version of Ubuntu that had shipped with the system 76 was

12:04.100 --> 12:12.060
Newer than the last LTS, but the Intel drivers to get the Wi-Fi to work had to have that that newer kernel

12:12.060 --> 12:15.140
So we ran into this weird issue where the software

12:15.580 --> 12:20.780
Software manufacturer would not give us they didn't have a version that would run on the newest version of Ubuntu

12:20.780 --> 12:21.880
Right, but he didn't have Wi-Fi

12:21.880 --> 12:27.180
So the solution was as crappy as it sounds he bought a brand new laptop and he had to have a USB dongle for a couple

12:27.180 --> 12:28.220
months until and

12:28.220 --> 12:33.940
So if my and I think if that was if that was a wider scale if we're going out to a server something like that

12:33.940 --> 12:40.100
If my choices are there's some sort of security vulnerability and granted heart bleed is a bit of an extreme example

12:40.100 --> 12:45.780
That would probably require us to sit down and talk about if using that software then is really still the best course of action

12:45.780 --> 12:48.940
But if if it's anything slightly smaller than that

12:48.940 --> 12:55.540
I would rather have the software work at all rather than even if it has some security flaws then not have access to that solution

12:56.540 --> 13:01.980
Yeah, I mean I can I can follow that line of thought for especially a class of software and use cases like

13:02.740 --> 13:04.740
word processor or

13:04.900 --> 13:08.820
Anything that doesn't have anything that doesn't here's where I draw the line

13:08.820 --> 13:14.260
Mm-hmm anything that could potentially reveal my user information or other users of the systems information

13:14.260 --> 13:17.520
So like say Jupiter broadcasting had its own mail server, right?

13:17.940 --> 13:23.000
And we were running it very likely if we did that we would be running it on a container on a digital ocean droplet

13:23.000 --> 13:27.860
Right, and let's say let's go back to this timber thing. Let's say we got a compromise. Mm-hmm now

13:29.100 --> 13:33.860
Maybe I wouldn't care so much about my information leaking out because I'd probably have a unique password for that server

13:33.860 --> 13:36.160
And so they just compromise just that account getting my email would suck

13:36.160 --> 13:40.200
But I do have the responsibility of everybody else that log. Yeah, right

13:40.200 --> 13:45.560
And so if you know Rekha is logging in and Alan's logging in and you're logging into it and Angela's like everybody's logging into this

13:45.560 --> 13:47.000
thing

13:47.000 --> 13:52.180
If that thing starts to have a year old see the problem is too is the longer these vulnerabilities hang around things like shell

13:52.180 --> 13:59.640
Shock and heart bleed. Mm-hmm. Those are so well known and there's such low-hanging fruit and some of them like heart bleed can be diagnosed

13:59.640 --> 14:03.800
Remotely that they just get they just get written into into IP scanner scripts

14:03.800 --> 14:10.600
yeah, and then you know, it becomes really almost no effort for them to start banging on your box and reading, you know, what I

14:11.560 --> 14:15.840
It's like because it's so easy for them to do it and because other people are impacted by it

14:15.840 --> 14:19.480
I feel like I have the responsibility to keep it even up to date even if I don't care about my own personal data

14:19.480 --> 14:22.580
Right, so I'm not saying that security isn't important, right?

14:22.580 --> 14:25.160
I'm not saying that we shouldn't have a methodology for updating

14:25.160 --> 14:30.400
I'm saying that the priority level should be get the software to work then let's make it secure and

14:30.400 --> 14:37.240
So that means that the security then falls upon whoever is releasing that docker container

14:38.320 --> 14:40.600
That shouldn't necessarily rely on you

14:40.600 --> 14:44.440
So when something like heart bleed comes out and all this data is leaked

14:44.440 --> 14:47.960
We I think we should just treat docker containers just like we would treat a piece of software

14:48.280 --> 14:51.520
Thunderbird had a had a security for saying the vendor should update it

14:51.520 --> 14:55.160
Right. Well, I'm just saying you wouldn't you wouldn't expect to say well Thunderbird has a security vulnerability

14:55.160 --> 14:56.760
I better log in there and and open the

14:56.760 --> 15:00.680
So shouldn't the way it work is like so say let's go back to Zimbra again because it's like we can both wrap our brain around

15:00.680 --> 15:04.320
This shouldn't December guys. Let's say they're distributing their software by a docker containers

15:05.720 --> 15:07.120
shouldn't they

15:07.120 --> 15:09.800
Test it in a docker container on their network

15:10.280 --> 15:14.840
Certify that the latest security updates work and then publish that version of the docker hub and then have that

15:14.920 --> 15:18.160
Distributed down to all of the people that are subscribed to that docker container

15:18.200 --> 15:23.100
yeah, shouldn't it basically be like a software vendor update because if they can test in a container and

15:23.100 --> 15:28.060
Verify it works and push those changes up to the docker hub and then everybody else is in a container

15:28.060 --> 15:32.100
It's not like there's random library vulnerabilities are randomness or anything like that

15:32.100 --> 15:36.620
They can just overwrite the same files like it seems like the solution here is for the vendor to patch

15:36.620 --> 15:40.860
But then the vendors in order to do that are gonna expect some money like you want us to update your our images

15:40.860 --> 15:42.740
Then you're gonna have to pay us for a support contract

15:42.740 --> 15:48.220
Yeah, there's no there's no way vendors are gonna update an Ubuntu 1404 container for five years for free, right? Yeah

15:48.860 --> 15:50.860
Yeah, that's probably they would I don't know

15:50.860 --> 15:54.660
Maybe they would just maybe they would because that's how people are getting their software. I

15:55.300 --> 15:56.940
Don't know but it's an interesting

15:56.940 --> 15:58.020
It's an interesting world

15:58.020 --> 16:02.980
We're moving into a software over the over the next couple of years on Linux is gonna change a lot

16:08.380 --> 16:14.080
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that invites you to insert your own Monday morning joke

16:14.300 --> 16:19.500
My name is Chris. My name is Noah. Hey Noah. Hey Monday here. Happy Monday. Happy Monday

16:19.500 --> 16:24.100
So we're doing this show on a Monday cuz Noah's here. He's flying out this evening. What are you flying out? Well?

16:25.180 --> 16:28.760
Hopefully tomorrow tomorrow morning or whatever. Yeah, we wanted to record today

16:28.760 --> 16:33.660
Yeah, we say tomorrow morning, but really that involves leaving here at like 1 30 in the morning Wow

16:34.260 --> 16:38.940
Yikes yikes. Well, so that's we're gonna get you now before we have to worry about that coming up on today's show

16:39.460 --> 16:42.740
We're gonna follow up on our fedora 22 review in just a little bit

16:42.740 --> 16:50.380
We're gonna spend some time talking about Gnome 3.18 the upcoming version of Gnome and also Gnome 3.16 victory lap

16:51.220 --> 16:55.060
As of fedora 22. Yeah, I know. I know. I know I'm being a little insinuating

16:55.380 --> 17:02.700
Also, we're gonna talk about the new Google Cardboard how it could work for Linux Dell's perhaps huge embrace of Ubuntu

17:02.980 --> 17:05.180
This is a big deal. We're gonna talk about that

17:05.340 --> 17:10.340
And then also we have a little surprise coming up in the feedback section of the show Noah. It's a packed show

17:10.340 --> 17:15.100
So like somehow even though you and I were just on air less than 24 hours ago doing the Linux action show

17:15.100 --> 17:17.500
Yeah, we just talked about Linux. How is there more Linux to talk about?

17:17.500 --> 17:22.000
We literally just literally been less than 24 hours since we did last yeah, does that blow your mind a little bit

17:22.000 --> 17:24.640
Yeah, it's been like less than 12 hours since last actually got published

17:25.900 --> 17:31.120
Wow talk about a content factory. Hey, so let's get into the catch-up

17:31.120 --> 17:34.580
There's some interesting stories that have actually managed to develop since we put together Linux actions

17:34.580 --> 17:36.020
Even though it's only been a couple of hours

17:36.020 --> 17:43.500
So I want to bring in the mumble room time appropriate greetings virtual lug I'm like is anybody there

17:47.500 --> 17:52.940
Wow, okay, we lost them all so Google I oh was last Thursday

17:52.940 --> 17:56.760
And it was the biggest IO in the history of the world

17:56.760 --> 18:01.420
Which isn't that actually hard of a record to set when you think about there's only been so many IOs and Google just keeps

18:01.420 --> 18:03.700
Getting bigger, but it was a monster

18:03.700 --> 18:08.260
It was like a four-hour keynote, and I am excited pretty much about one thing

18:08.260 --> 18:12.100
I mean, I'm excited about a few things that came out, but hear more my hear more of my thoughts in code radio

18:12.140 --> 18:14.140
but for us Linux users I

18:14.500 --> 18:17.860
Think there's some potentially I think we need to get on board with this you familiar with Google Cardboard

18:17.860 --> 18:22.540
I am yeah, they're VR cardboard that they gave out at last year's

18:23.540 --> 18:25.220
Google IO you know it's funny

18:25.220 --> 18:31.080
I've heard this described a couple of ways some people say this is Google flailing saying they can't come up with any ideas in the

18:31.080 --> 18:34.060
VR market, and so they're just dropping this on the public and saying here figure it out

18:34.060 --> 18:37.620
I am not such a pessimist so they updated their two point

18:37.620 --> 18:39.700
They just a Google Cardboard VR 2.0

18:39.700 --> 18:45.740
And it just supports up to six inch screens now including internet phones if you're a masochist and it is

18:46.300 --> 18:48.860
Completely published as an open spec. There's already websites

18:48.860 --> 18:51.860
That's they're selling an entire kit for like $20 or whatever

18:51.860 --> 18:56.240
Uh-huh and you basically get a fully usable VR environment

18:56.240 --> 18:59.400
When it comes with little glasses that it comes preset in there that are in there

18:59.400 --> 19:04.860
And you just put your smartphone in there, and you have legitimate virtual reality for $30

19:04.860 --> 19:06.860
And there's already apps out there to do this

19:07.140 --> 19:09.600
There's already apps in the Play Store to take advantage of it

19:09.600 --> 19:13.340
And there's nothing that says you couldn't hook it up to a Linux box and create

19:13.740 --> 19:20.300
this could be the avenue for the community to create their the beginnings of their own open source response to the

19:20.900 --> 19:25.460
Oculus Rift yeah, yeah, you know what's neat about that is if that so imagine this

19:25.460 --> 19:30.500
Oculus wants to take this the the quote-unquote high road with yeah with with

19:32.380 --> 19:33.700
Microsoft

19:33.700 --> 19:39.140
Microsoft they make do they make small things well they make that the that challenger to Linux I

19:40.100 --> 19:42.580
Microsoft it's that sounds like a viagra competitor to me

19:43.180 --> 19:45.980
Windows they make Windows you've ever used it yeah, man

19:45.980 --> 19:50.220
It cost a lot of money because it crashes a lot and stuff, but and they break you know like yeah

19:50.220 --> 19:53.020
Yeah, yeah, but they have but it has tiles so

19:53.020 --> 19:55.020
okay, but they

19:55.300 --> 19:57.300
So they're gonna take that road

19:57.380 --> 20:04.420
Imagine this imagine imagine when imagine when this takes off like the Raspberry Pi does and everyone that wants to play

20:05.080 --> 20:06.840
Everyone wants to play with it goes there well

20:06.840 --> 20:10.780
I could get that thing, but I'm locked into the games that they tell me I can play with the operating system

20:10.780 --> 20:13.500
They tell me I can play with and and the SDK that they're gonna

20:13.500 --> 20:18.780
Tell me when it's gonna release and then there's this and it's like I think do it's almost a bigger competitor to Samsung Samsung

20:18.780 --> 20:22.140
Gear VR is essentially this you put a smartphone in the gear VR, but Corky

20:22.140 --> 20:25.740
Do you oh, I'm sorry it was in a go-go in a go-go

20:25.740 --> 20:30.560
Do you think that maybe we're just getting too excited that Google cardboard is kind of a crappy product?

20:31.380 --> 20:37.940
Yeah, mainly the cardboard bit because I I got the last version for Christmas, and it was and by

20:38.900 --> 20:42.140
The end of February it kind of had fallen apart

20:43.140 --> 20:44.820
so

20:44.820 --> 20:50.460
Would it would it make you feel better that there is several different companies that right now that are working on

20:50.460 --> 20:52.900
3d printed versions of Google Cardboard

20:52.900 --> 20:58.420
So it's a much sturdier case you can print it out at home or buy it it comes with the lenses you can get it

20:58.420 --> 21:03.340
In different colors, there's a lot of people that are working on different kinds of moldings for the Google Cardboard, too

21:03.340 --> 21:07.240
It doesn't actually have to be cardboard. It's just the nice thing about cardboard is you can make it yourself, and it's

21:08.020 --> 21:10.520
It's sturdy and it's so great thing about the correlation

21:11.300 --> 21:14.740
Yeah, but not all phones work with it either because some

21:14.740 --> 21:20.620
For what there's one feature that requires a compass because it's like this trigger on the side yeah

21:20.980 --> 21:23.260
And not all phones have a compass

21:23.820 --> 21:28.780
Yeah, and there is definitely limitations there. I know I mean I kind of look at that as like saying well

21:29.100 --> 21:34.680
Not all HDMI monitors. No, no, it's not are gonna work with are gonna work with the raspberry pi

21:34.680 --> 21:36.460
I also look at this as sort of a Model T

21:36.460 --> 21:42.300
That is available to the community to tinker with not like not like a full-on competitor like honestly

21:42.300 --> 21:47.680
We need to start somewhere. It's kind of my philosophy about it is and when you get that price point down

21:47.680 --> 21:52.320
so and this is the thing that was great about the pie, and that's this is what's great about this thing is I

21:53.200 --> 21:58.280
Cannot afford to spend five or six or seven hundred dollars on a computer for a project that may or may not work

21:58.440 --> 22:02.380
But I can spend the I can spend the the money

22:03.320 --> 22:09.160
$30-$40 on a piece of cardboard to to put my phone in to play with it, and if it doesn't work. That's fine

22:09.160 --> 22:13.560
Yeah, yeah, I do agree with you there, and I I look forward to seeing where it goes

22:13.680 --> 22:16.080
Hopefully there's something that comes out of it. It doesn't just fizzle away

22:16.080 --> 22:21.280
I don't think it will but I'd like to see the open-source community embrace it there could be I mean just think about the potential

22:21.280 --> 22:23.700
Windowing environments all kinds of things could be really cool

22:24.200 --> 22:25.480
but

22:25.480 --> 22:30.460
We'll have to wait and see hey Noah. I know that you and I've talked about Dell before mm-hmm

22:30.880 --> 22:32.880
Matt wasn't a huge fan Adele. Yeah

22:33.600 --> 22:37.780
I'm not a huge fan. I I I talk about Dell kind of like I talk about

22:37.780 --> 22:42.180
Cars and things like that like I feel like Dell's like a pretty good choice

22:42.180 --> 22:43.580
It's not always gonna blow me away

22:43.580 --> 22:46.940
But it's gonna get me a pretty good value for the price and come with a warranty so full disclosure

22:47.620 --> 22:52.820
As you know I'm an I we own an IT company, and we are partnered with Dell so

22:54.340 --> 22:56.340
My I'm probably a little biased

22:56.580 --> 23:00.940
Because I've been we've had a very very good experience with Dell and part of that experience

23:01.100 --> 23:04.580
Probably comes from the fact that Dell really values their commercial market

23:04.580 --> 23:10.100
Which is kind of funny because when Dell started they started really valuing that consumer market and somehow

23:10.100 --> 23:13.880
They kind of made that switch, but from a business perspective the nice thing about Dell is as Dell partner

23:14.180 --> 23:17.220
When I want parts they just they ship them to me and to supply them to a client

23:17.700 --> 23:20.500
So my my experience with Dell has always been

23:21.340 --> 23:24.580
pretty solid on the business side a little a

23:25.140 --> 23:30.280
Little adversarial like when doing large server purchases and things like that and then screwing me a few times on things

23:30.280 --> 23:35.220
I didn't really need are selling me like an entire series of bad tape drives an entire series of bad perk controllers

23:35.220 --> 23:38.760
Which was the entire reason for the partner program because now you don't deal with those people you deal with me

23:38.760 --> 23:40.780
Yeah, and I can come on to your site

23:40.780 --> 23:43.620
And I can look and then and I just go into a portal and order that stuff

23:43.620 --> 23:49.500
Yeah, and but you know and but my preferred my preference there though is I mean not to deal with people like you yeah

23:49.500 --> 23:52.440
I'm sure like I actually prefer like the IX approach

23:52.440 --> 23:55.780
Yeah, and that's sort of when I realized where I have the issues with Dell

23:55.780 --> 23:59.660
But if you remove that layer of Dell I like I like things like their service tag set up

23:59.660 --> 24:01.820
I like that you know they have a really good database

24:01.820 --> 24:06.420
And you just really look up all the drivers for your machine and and like they have to be fair like when we have those

24:06.420 --> 24:09.740
Tape drives that just failed one after another they're always very solid about replacing them right

24:10.020 --> 24:15.980
And so I what I've always met ran down with issues with Dell has been in the consumer space and sort of how they like

24:16.580 --> 24:21.940
They kind of keep putting their foot in with Linux, and then they dump it and they're like oh just kidding in the US

24:21.980 --> 24:25.240
Yes in the US because in other parts of the world. That's a very different story

24:25.240 --> 24:30.600
Right and that's what's been very frustrating for me is to see them be committed in other parts of the world and be like why

24:30.600 --> 24:36.760
Aren't you committing here? Just stick to it like you do in other places. Just stick to it. Yeah, and so I was really happy

24:37.160 --> 24:39.160
That when they first launched the spots

24:39.600 --> 24:44.400
Sorry, China China China for China for example, and yeah, and India yeah

24:44.400 --> 24:49.320
I mean so they have they have they have widely push in fact if you go to like the kiosks in the mall here

24:49.320 --> 24:53.080
We see kiosks in the mall that have Dell computers if you go over to China or India

24:53.080 --> 24:55.380
You go into those into those malls

24:55.380 --> 24:56.820
You're gonna see a lot of Ubuntu kiosks

24:56.820 --> 25:01.620
And they're gonna push the computers that that run Ubuntu and the reason for that is is because the market is so much

25:01.620 --> 25:03.660
I think the market is better there

25:03.660 --> 25:08.060
They believe the market is better there to push those open source solutions that they can do that in the US

25:08.180 --> 25:14.580
Yeah, I guess and I guess it's probably partially driven by cost and partially you know other other factors political. Maybe I don't know

25:15.300 --> 25:17.140
but

25:17.140 --> 25:21.900
That has always kind of left a bad taste in my mouth when it comes to Dell's approach the Sputnik program first gave me some

25:21.900 --> 25:27.860
Hope and then the spike and then they then they launched the XPS 13 spotting version which is a pretty solid machine

25:27.980 --> 25:32.860
So I when I saw this article this kind of grabbed my attention like this seems to be

25:33.340 --> 25:38.020
Another pretty big step in the right direction for Dell's commitment to Ubuntu

25:38.700 --> 25:43.420
Check this out Noah. You know of course Dell and canonical have been longtime partners, and they just updated

25:43.420 --> 25:47.260
What was that $200 Ubuntu Dell laptop? Yeah? I just I was just pulling that up

25:47.260 --> 25:53.160
It is the it is the it's it's a 250. It's a 250 $49 laptop

25:53.160 --> 25:57.160
And in fact I have a person in my mind of who might be the first recipient

25:58.580 --> 26:03.140
It's like a week out right right right so what's gonna end up happening is I think I'm gonna start her with a

26:03.740 --> 26:07.160
With with another computer that I have set up, but if it takes off, and she's like you know

26:07.160 --> 26:12.700
I really like this thing just be nice to have it on some newer hardware. It's the inspiron 15 3000

26:12.700 --> 26:17.500
Yes, it's available for $249 and comes pre-installed with Ubuntu and

26:18.580 --> 26:21.580
Specs on it and all there. Yeah, I have it actually right in front of me. It is a

26:22.400 --> 26:26.940
So it's for four gigabytes of RAM. It's an Intel Celeron, which is basically what you expect

26:26.940 --> 26:29.220
Well, so what this is I know I know what this is Chris

26:29.860 --> 26:32.940
That's right, but it's a Chromebook that I can just that comes with Linux

26:33.460 --> 26:35.820
And I think that'll do all right 500 gig

26:35.820 --> 26:38.920
It's a spinning it's a spinning rust drive of course integrated graphics

26:38.920 --> 26:45.240
And then 1366 by 768 by 4 for 250 you could go you go of new egg spend another 80 bucks and put a decent SSD

26:45.240 --> 26:50.820
In there right and the thing is for the people that are checking their email for the people that are browsing Facebook

26:51.500 --> 26:56.500
Editing editing some basic work documents not doing anything too heavy. This is a great computer form yeah

26:56.500 --> 26:59.700
I think that's I think it's a real sell for down. Yeah, that's yeah

26:59.700 --> 27:04.460
That's it so they're playing at the XPS level which is around a grand another playing down at the $250 level

27:04.460 --> 27:10.820
I think the $250 level is I'm surprised somebody else like HP or somebody else doesn't come out and say let's take our Chromebook hard

27:10.820 --> 27:12.740
We're just put Ubuntu on exactly why not what's it up?

27:12.740 --> 27:17.060
What's gonna? Is it off there because they I think that those companies think that there is a bigger investment to be made on

27:17.380 --> 27:21.300
Google's Chrome OS yeah, and I honestly I honestly suspected to that

27:21.740 --> 27:27.580
Intel and Google have been subsidizing the hardware, and I believe Intel is pulling back on that now to a degree yeah, so anyways

27:28.140 --> 27:30.620
Dell tweeted out on the 27th of May

27:30.620 --> 27:36.220
Del's a delcarespro account at delcarespro mm-hmm tweeted out time for a new OS

27:36.860 --> 27:43.420
Time for a new OS why not try hashtag Ubuntu check out our Ubuntu installation guide this is coming from Dell's official

27:43.420 --> 27:50.180
Yeah, verified Twitter account insane time for a new OS check out Ubuntu from Dell's freaking Twitter account. That's pretty cool

27:50.340 --> 27:53.260
I'm gonna check how many followers that maybe they don't have any followers, so it doesn't matter

27:53.260 --> 27:55.820
Well, they have say of almost they have 10,000 followers

27:55.820 --> 28:00.340
So that's not bad. You know there's the Dell's global technical support for business customers

28:00.340 --> 28:04.460
Follow us to get valuable information and support your company's IT infrastructure

28:04.460 --> 28:10.860
And they're recommending people try out Ubuntu, and they've included a link to a Dell support article

28:10.860 --> 28:13.900
Which is how to install Ubuntu Linux on your Dell PC?

28:14.700 --> 28:18.360
Yeah, this is legit look at this article. This is legit. Yeah

28:18.500 --> 28:22.400
Yeah, and you know the thing is there are other things that Dell can push

28:22.400 --> 28:26.720
And you are the chat room is figuring it out that Dell can sell this computer and say listen

28:27.120 --> 28:29.440
You don't need an upgrade for an antivirus it

28:30.200 --> 28:33.720
It's not necessary, so yeah, that's not necessarily a perk for Dell though

28:33.720 --> 28:36.160
Those are those are upsells that don't make money. That's money

28:36.160 --> 28:39.640
That's that's true, but the but Dell also makes money off of selling their computers

28:39.640 --> 28:42.520
And if they can get away with saying this is a more competitive product

28:42.520 --> 28:47.560
Then the then other offerings from other manufacturers that puts a leg up everyone's buying this

28:47.560 --> 28:54.400
$259 computer instead of the instead of the instead of the $300 HP that is at best buy well

28:54.400 --> 28:57.600
If they can deploy Ubuntu, I don't know what their arrangement is with canonical

28:57.600 --> 29:01.200
But I gotta imagine they're probably not paying for every seat of Ubuntu mm-hmm

29:01.720 --> 29:04.360
So no, and I don't really know the details of Dell very well

29:04.360 --> 29:06.880
I don't know maybe you follow them, but are they now a private company? Yeah?

29:06.880 --> 29:11.280
Well, so this may be the result of all this that this is that's a complicated question to the best of my understanding

29:11.840 --> 29:15.660
They are owned by a private company, which is owned by

29:15.660 --> 29:18.220
Actually, I believe it's Microsoft

29:19.020 --> 29:26.220
The company that the company that took that the company that gave them the money to buy Dell back is backed by Microsoft investors

29:26.220 --> 29:29.500
I got an idea so when in doubt you know you know what we do when in jail

29:29.500 --> 29:32.520
We ask we just ask okay, Google

29:33.800 --> 29:35.800
Who owns Dell?

29:36.700 --> 29:38.940
Let's see what according to the Dallas Morning News

29:38.940 --> 29:46.100
Dell Inc. which had grown to one of the biggest computer makers in the world during 25 years as a public company is now privately held

29:46.500 --> 29:54.220
Michael Dell the 48 year old company founder and CEO owns about three-quarters of the company and his investment ally Silver Lake Partners

29:54.980 --> 30:01.700
That's right. Okay, okay, so if you look Silver Lake is some partners. Yeah is somehow in bed with Mike. Yeah

30:01.700 --> 30:04.660
Yeah, I do remember that now. I wonder if okay Google

30:04.660 --> 30:20.780
Who is Silver Lake Partners? According to Wikipedia, Silver Lake is an American private equity firm focused on leverage, buyout, and growth capital investments in technology, technology-enabled and related industries.

30:21.300 --> 30:25.900
Yeah, founded in 1999 it says so that's interesting. That's really yeah

30:25.900 --> 30:32.660
So and I actually said it my Dell rep is very very much aware of my of my strong Linux preference, right?

30:32.660 --> 30:39.420
And so he knows better that he knows better than to ever recommend a product or tell me about a product that I can't put Linux

30:39.420 --> 30:43.020
Yeah, so when this came through I actually called him and I said hey, you know

30:43.020 --> 30:44.300
How is this gonna affect things?

30:44.300 --> 30:48.580
Because right now every Dell I've ever bought I've been able to throw Linux on and it works right out of the box

30:48.580 --> 30:52.300
Is that gonna change with me? And he said no, it's not because you're worried about the Microsoft connection

30:52.300 --> 30:55.340
Yeah, and this seems to be an indication. Maybe you shouldn't be worried. Yeah

30:55.340 --> 30:59.580
Well in his and here's the thing I know you can't actually trust to be quite honest

30:59.580 --> 31:04.780
I don't actually trust everything he says because he's yeah, he's gonna he's gonna sell me the company

31:04.780 --> 31:05.780
So he knows what I want to hear

31:05.780 --> 31:07.420
Yeah, because I made it very clear to him in the past

31:07.420 --> 31:10.500
So I know what he's gonna say even before I asked but I wanted to get it on record here

31:10.500 --> 31:16.020
We are and this is why I brought this whole topic up is because here we are on the preface of like what's Dell doing?

31:16.020 --> 31:19.520
Are they doing some good stuff here? I mean they're shipping more machines than ever with Ubuntu

31:19.520 --> 31:22.940
They're tweeting out to their business customers switch to Ubuntu

31:22.940 --> 31:27.900
They're creating guides on their support site how to switch your Dell machine over to Ubuntu, but then they're owned

31:27.900 --> 31:29.900
by

31:30.500 --> 31:35.340
They are they are owned by Michael Dell Michael Dell got his money from a finance company

31:35.340 --> 31:41.820
Which yeah, but so there are so many steps of removal from Microsoft that the influence may be maybe not there at the end

31:41.820 --> 31:45.640
I'm excited to see where this is going. I'm getting excited. Yeah, are you getting excited about well?

31:45.640 --> 31:51.420
I'm getting excited because I've been excited for a little while because as a Dell partner, that's that's what we sell

31:51.420 --> 31:52.600
That's what we give to customers

31:52.600 --> 31:56.160
So I need to be able to go into those clients and say well you bought your computer with Windows

31:56.160 --> 31:58.820
I want to put Linux on it, and I've never had a problem doing that

31:58.820 --> 32:00.700
And I don't ever want to have a problem doing that right

32:01.140 --> 32:04.860
but the thing that is exciting about this two hundred forty nine dollar laptop is I

32:05.460 --> 32:09.560
Am the kind of person that if I see somebody that is not using Linux

32:09.560 --> 32:13.800
I would like to get them to use Linux and to do that oftentimes that means they're just buy them a machine

32:15.300 --> 32:18.140
What that means I was trying to think of a more graceful way to say it

32:18.140 --> 32:22.580
But the reality is is a lot of times if I come to your house, and you have everything set up

32:22.580 --> 32:27.060
You're not just gonna. Let me erase your computer. Yeah, put something else on it, but you will yeah

32:27.060 --> 32:28.620
Well if I'm like here play with this new toy

32:28.620 --> 32:31.580
Yeah, you'd give it a shot especially if it's nicer, and then once you get it hooked

32:31.580 --> 32:34.560
And I just dealt with this I just dealt with this before I came out here

32:34.560 --> 32:38.980
There was a guy that I had we he actually bought a Lenovo yoga based off of

32:39.460 --> 32:41.820
My recommendation based off what Angela was doing yeah?

32:41.820 --> 32:44.900
And the way I got him to switch was I didn't give him a laptop

32:44.900 --> 32:47.900
But I gave him a hard drive with Linux on it and put it in his existing laptop

32:47.900 --> 32:52.500
And he just didn't want to go back yeah, and then he bought hardware, and yep windows is gone

32:52.500 --> 32:58.220
Yeah, but so this two hundred forty nine dollar laptop is because there's a limit to how much I can do that right yeah

32:58.220 --> 33:01.840
I have a finite budget, but two hundred forty nine dollar laptop brand new

33:02.260 --> 33:05.500
That's it with a warranty. I mean you might go into my cost a little more

33:05.500 --> 33:07.500
And maybe they'll let you customize and put an SSD in there

33:08.220 --> 33:10.960
Rotten corpse you have information about the Silver Lake connection there

33:11.660 --> 33:18.300
Yeah, the reason why there was a connection to Microsoft is because they're like owned inside of a consortium. They owned part of

33:19.140 --> 33:20.820
70% of Skype oh

33:20.820 --> 33:24.460
Okay, oh interesting so when they sold the Skype and they become part of

33:25.020 --> 33:31.700
They like it wasn't completely like there's actually some kind of stuff with like the CEOs of Silver Lake or some kind of connected

33:31.700 --> 33:36.440
As well, but it was it all started with Skype in 2000 I see thank you for the information and Corky

33:36.440 --> 33:40.140
You think maybe we're getting too excited. Maybe there's a much more practical reason for this

33:41.140 --> 33:46.440
I think I haven't checked recently, but Dell has traditionally had a

33:46.440 --> 33:52.160
Banner saying Dell recommends Windows 8 for quite a while. Yeah, that must have been an

33:52.880 --> 34:00.080
Advertising deal and if that's come to an end, and they know no longer a contractually obliged to

34:00.760 --> 34:05.240
Recommend Windows right they might be taking advantage with this could you imagine?

34:05.920 --> 34:11.060
Yeah, because you're right they probably had a they have they might even had a they might had a marketing deal

34:11.060 --> 34:16.720
That was so lucrative and so important to Dell that it might have been something like you need to position your company as

34:17.120 --> 34:21.480
Supporting Windows like your entire company needs to position and then Dell's wiggling these Ubuntu machines out

34:21.480 --> 34:24.740
And then if that deal expires they're no longer. I mean who knows yeah

34:24.740 --> 34:28.200
Maybe the reality is the band in a go-go is checking their sites as the banners are gone

34:28.200 --> 34:32.280
I don't I don't take too much stock in that because the reality is Dell

34:32.600 --> 34:37.280
Doesn't exist to advocate for Linux or open source Dell is has one goal, and I don't make money

34:37.280 --> 34:39.440
Oh for sure well, but so what I'm where I'm going with that is

34:39.440 --> 34:44.960
This idea that if Dell wants if Dell wants to sell

34:45.560 --> 34:50.320
Computers they're gonna sell with whatever with whatever they think the market wants and so if Microsoft says

34:50.640 --> 34:54.840
They want to recommend Windows 8 so be it but if the people that are looking to buy Ubuntu

34:54.840 --> 34:59.200
I don't think that's gonna cut into their sales whether that banners there or not because the people that want to buy a bunch of

34:59.200 --> 35:03.800
Laptop will just know I think what I'm saying and maybe Corky's implying too is that?

35:04.760 --> 35:07.600
That marketing contract we're assuming mm-hmm

35:07.600 --> 35:08.960
would

35:08.960 --> 35:13.920
Prevent them from outwardly positioning themselves as supporting Ubuntu like tweeting it and creating guides and things like that right

35:13.920 --> 35:15.920
I don't I don't but there's

35:16.600 --> 35:22.640
Yeah, huh, I mean Microsoft's in Microsoft's here's what what here's here's the difference between a million dollar contract and a ten million dollar contract

35:22.640 --> 35:24.840
Position your entire company. Here's a ten million dollar contract

35:25.200 --> 35:31.200
So where is the money coming from to position themselves to support Ubuntu selling more machines as that contract expires?

35:31.200 --> 35:33.300
They're no longer getting that money. They just want to sell more machines

35:33.300 --> 35:38.600
Why not market your Ubuntu machines something haven't heavily marketed before also if I was them I'd be hedging my bets

35:38.600 --> 35:42.040
So that so that's my that's my question. Why is it that you think that that?

35:42.920 --> 35:47.600
That they're going to sell more machines by saying we support it, but I like Corky's there Corky

35:47.600 --> 35:51.680
You have a good theory, and I'm totally on board with it. Yeah. Well. I'm just trying to understand. I just Corky Corky

35:51.680 --> 35:55.220
What's yours? Why why would Dell be doing this right now? You think it's a negotiation tactic?

35:55.960 --> 36:03.120
Well, I well, I hope it's a positive thing, but then this is Dell so maybe they're just trying to force Microsoft

36:03.120 --> 36:04.600
to up their bid

36:04.600 --> 36:07.400
with renewing this advertising bid I

36:08.800 --> 36:13.200
The reason why I give that stock right is because I think some of the reasons why they've flirted with the Ubuntu market in

36:13.200 --> 36:15.480
The past of them pulled out is they were negotiating with Microsoft

36:15.480 --> 36:19.680
Yeah, that could be I guess what I'm getting at is I don't see I guess what I'm saying is

36:19.680 --> 36:22.820
I don't think it's going to affect their their their Ubuntu market

36:23.760 --> 36:28.320
To a certain extent anyway if they if they remove all those banners and say we support Ubuntu

36:28.320 --> 36:32.720
Or they don't do that because I think the people that are buying an Ubuntu laptop are buying it for two reasons either one

36:32.720 --> 36:36.440
They know the advantages or they want a cheap computer right well

36:36.440 --> 36:44.180
So then then the banner being gone and that might that that that deal expiring probably won't change their dynamic much unless now

36:44.180 --> 36:47.360
They're promoting it more outwardly like through Twitter and on the support calls and things like that

36:47.360 --> 36:50.080
They weren't doing before we can hope we can hope we can know well

36:50.080 --> 36:52.640
I think what we should do is a little market research yeah

36:53.320 --> 36:57.720
Next time you call Dell you ought to ask him about Ubuntu and see what they say sure well my rep like you said

36:57.720 --> 37:03.320
But he know yeah, yeah, yeah your reps gonna. I mean he's a little different cuz he'll look up and before he even gets on

37:03.320 --> 37:04.280
The phone with me, and he'll say well

37:04.280 --> 37:09.640
This is the latest machine we have that runs Linux and you're you'd be happy to know that we had a client that bought a couple

37:09.640 --> 37:15.200
Hundred of these particular latitude series, and they all worked with Linux flawlessly and all right boys

37:15.280 --> 37:16.320
You know all of a sudden

37:16.320 --> 37:21.680
I'm just arguing like notifications like crazy on my phone today like now Spotify's noting notify me about tracks added to the radio stations

37:21.680 --> 37:26.140
I've listened because you're popular. I guess I want I guess what I need to do

37:26.140 --> 37:27.800
I need to Zen out

37:27.800 --> 37:32.920
I need to go to my I need to go to my comfort zone my my sweet spot my place of

37:33.760 --> 37:36.880
Absolute education and focus and learning that's right my friends

37:36.880 --> 37:42.640
I call it the man cave where I bring up Linux Academy comm and I begin to learn and you can too by going to

37:42.640 --> 37:49.040
Linux academy comm slash unplugged sponsor of the unplug program perfect sponsor, and no I you got to check out Linux Academy

37:50.080 --> 37:53.440
Yeah, I have a membership. Whatever it is a subscription. Yeah, yeah, yeah

37:53.440 --> 37:59.240
Go to Linux go to Linux Academy comm slash unplug to get the Linux unplugged 33% discount and then go check out their features

37:59.520 --> 38:04.520
It's a really great service created by people that are truly passionate about Linux and open source, and they do a great job

38:04.960 --> 38:07.280
They have self-paced courses you can get

38:07.920 --> 38:11.920
All the content you can download it offline and like take it at your own pace, too

38:11.920 --> 38:17.880
Which is great for commuters if you want to read the stuff and they have over 1500 video courses for you to take they have

38:17.880 --> 38:21.240
Scenario based lab so you get a real hands-on like experience

38:21.240 --> 38:26.880
Seven plus Linux distributions and the courseware will automatically adjust to those distros and the virtual machines adjust to those distros

38:26.880 --> 38:28.640
I love that

38:28.640 --> 38:33.800
Have you seen some of the new stuff they've rolled out recently so I went to the when when when rel

38:33.840 --> 38:37.720
Release when rel released rel 7 usually I pay my you know

38:37.720 --> 38:42.000
Whatever it is $800 thousand dollars to go out for two days and get a little refresher course

38:42.000 --> 38:44.800
Yeah, and then they tell me all the things that are new and then I go take the cert

38:45.320 --> 38:50.760
I did all that on Linux Academy this year because Linux Academy has they actually have a course or I

38:50.760 --> 38:55.280
Already have there's there's two courses. There's a course of teach me about Red Hat Enterprise Linux, right?

38:55.280 --> 39:00.760
And then there's a I understand Red Hat Enterprise Linux. I just I've been supporting six. I want to support seven

39:00.760 --> 39:03.200
So tell me what are the what are the headlines?

39:03.200 --> 39:07.720
Give me the bullet points of what if what has changed between six and seven that is so nice

39:07.720 --> 39:12.120
It is because I don't have the time no I know right and you know the thing is training events

39:12.120 --> 39:16.800
The problem is even if the training is really condensed because they do Red Hat does a fantastic job about getting it real down

39:16.800 --> 39:19.080
Yeah, but it's still it's a day. I have to arrive a day ahead of time

39:19.080 --> 39:22.960
Yeah, I have to rent a hotel right the rest of the day after I'm done with the class is blown

39:22.960 --> 39:26.720
So you're probably you're already gonna run a car. I am running a car. I'm paying for meals out

39:26.720 --> 39:29.760
Yeah, there's this huge expense that time suck

39:29.760 --> 39:34.400
Yeah of going to these things and now I can do that on my laptop when I want in my skippies at night

39:34.400 --> 39:36.360
I know and these guys are mostly and this is the best stuff

39:36.360 --> 39:39.440
This is the best stuff around on how to do this and they've got the you can you know

39:39.440 --> 39:42.880
You can get all of the study material. You can bring that with you. They're always keeping the stuff relevant

39:42.880 --> 39:45.960
They just rolled out some new Red Hat stuff. It's really nice

39:45.960 --> 39:49.200
And I think you know and you know what you got to do you got to think about it

39:49.200 --> 39:51.800
They're gonna they're starting to roll out public profiles

39:51.800 --> 39:56.000
So when you're really like your achievement courses and stuff like that on the public profile like you're embarrassed

39:57.600 --> 40:00.600
You know what Pete the Red Hat stuff like if you did nothing with the Red Hat stuff

40:00.600 --> 40:02.480
It's like at least to be all hardcore stuff on your thing

40:02.480 --> 40:07.360
Well, it's one of those things where like I just do things I'm interested in and then I only a car

40:07.360 --> 40:12.520
I only will look at the area you need. Yeah, that's nice though. It is they've got right? Yes

40:12.520 --> 40:17.080
I know you wouldn't want to publicly show that they've got they've really got like so much great stuff

40:17.080 --> 40:20.740
Like are you gonna try out their Python courses actually so funny you mentioned that

40:21.240 --> 40:24.460
So the not being a developer, but I kind of want to look I'm like you

40:24.460 --> 40:27.120
I kind of want to dabble in the idea of development because I like to understand these things

40:27.120 --> 40:33.020
Exactly, and so the great thing about that was I will because my in my mind is so a DD

40:33.020 --> 40:35.380
I'm like, oh I got done with the Red Hat stuff. Well, I'll go start Python

40:35.380 --> 40:35.680
You know what?

40:35.680 --> 40:38.200
I noticed Chris the guy that teaches Red Hat

40:38.200 --> 40:42.600
Lives eats and breathes Red Hat like you can you can just tell by the way he talks

40:42.600 --> 40:48.040
Yeah, the guy knows Red Hat and like he'll make off-handed comments. Like he'll say oh, you know that you know

40:48.040 --> 40:50.880
This particular thing of course back in version 5 this way. Yeah

40:51.480 --> 40:52.960
That's a guy that's been around

40:52.960 --> 40:57.900
Then I go and take one of their programming courses and that guy knows like everything there is to know

40:58.400 --> 41:01.880
You know about what he's like in their true testaments to their profession

41:01.880 --> 41:05.520
And it's not just like they have hired a couple people and said alright

41:05.520 --> 41:08.640
You're gonna sit in this room and we're gonna prepare content and then you present it. No, no

41:08.640 --> 41:11.280
No, they took the time to go find industry experts

41:11.280 --> 41:14.840
Yeah present this stuff and then they have they have you know

41:14.840 --> 41:19.640
Like you've seen that where you can customize the course to do. I just want to learn about this specific

41:19.640 --> 41:22.480
Yeah, that's what they have the new nuggets and there's a ton of them

41:22.480 --> 41:26.160
In fact, you can you can go to Linux Academy comm slash nuggets and just do a deep dive

41:26.160 --> 41:28.640
I love that as a new feat. That's another new feature

41:28.640 --> 41:31.920
They've just rolled out a lot of cool stuff coming to Linux Academy all the time

41:31.920 --> 41:33.240
That's why the membership makes so much sense

41:33.240 --> 41:36.120
And I want you to get that 33% discount by going to Linux Academy comm

41:36.600 --> 41:43.240
Slash unplugged and a big thanks Linux Academy for rockin support of the Linux unplug program. You guys are awesome

41:43.920 --> 41:48.720
Alright, let's get into some emails. We haven't done emails on the unplugged show for a while and we got a bunch

41:48.720 --> 41:53.280
So a Dario are writes in with the Ubuntu CC topics

41:53.280 --> 41:55.240
It's not sure if you guys going to cover this or not

41:55.240 --> 41:59.040
Oh really this one on unplugged or laughs, but I just found this comment on the same site

41:59.040 --> 42:01.040
I really think they'll understand what's going on

42:01.040 --> 42:02.760
Oh

42:02.760 --> 42:04.760
All right, so he's talking about the kabuntu drama

42:05.120 --> 42:07.120
Do we want to talk about this? It's up to you

42:07.280 --> 42:11.000
Does anybody in the mumble room want to talk about the kabuntu community council drama? I?

42:12.400 --> 42:15.640
Mean you can if you want to I mean we I'm not avoiding the topic. I just

42:16.440 --> 42:21.460
Okay. Well, here's what I'll say on it. Um in our feedback thread for fedora 22

42:22.260 --> 42:28.000
You can there's there's a comment thread open and Palasso has the epic comment of all comments Noah

42:28.000 --> 42:33.480
It look at this thing here. He breaks down. What is the Ubuntu community council?

42:33.640 --> 42:39.120
What decision is being made the redaction to the decision or I'm sorry the reaction to the decision

42:39.120 --> 42:44.420
I have light shining on my screen and the aftermath plus closing thoughts and he breaks down some acronyms, too

42:44.420 --> 42:49.760
This is such a solid contribution. I don't know what more we could contribute the comment here

42:49.760 --> 42:50.040
Yeah

42:50.040 --> 42:54.480
And we're this there's really been no development for those of you are not familiar what's going on

42:54.480 --> 42:58.920
Jonathan riddle has been asked to stand down as leader of the Ubuntu community council, I guess

42:59.320 --> 43:03.920
He actually explains it all in here and a lot of people in the project are upset by that

43:04.520 --> 43:06.720
the decision remains at a standstill and

43:08.640 --> 43:13.560
Plasso you're in the mumble room right now. Did you have any thoughts you wanted to add to the coverage of it?

43:13.560 --> 43:15.720
Are you right up by the way? Yeah, you seem to be following it very closely

43:15.720 --> 43:24.360
Did you have any any follow-up to our coverage or any comments you wanted to kind of get on the record? I don't have anything

43:25.400 --> 43:32.660
Than what I wrote, I would like to mention that there were two things two issues

43:35.640 --> 43:39.200
We're asking about on the community council

43:41.800 --> 43:43.280
Right

43:43.280 --> 43:48.960
that were on the dot-com website and it seems that the

43:50.600 --> 43:52.040
The

43:52.040 --> 43:57.080
community members don't know how they have been used and the other that was

43:57.960 --> 43:59.960
mentioned was

44:00.040 --> 44:02.040
the part of the

44:03.520 --> 44:06.840
IP policy of canonical about the binaries

44:08.040 --> 44:10.400
Yeah that you know, and it's one of those things

44:10.400 --> 44:13.480
The the the write-up itself

44:14.440 --> 44:16.440
Explains a lot of that stuff

44:16.640 --> 44:20.640
And goes into it with a little more detail and we talked about it on last

44:20.640 --> 44:25.520
But the reality is we just nobody really knows the whole story, right? Yeah, so it's it's it

44:25.520 --> 44:29.660
We you kind of want to stay away from making present, you know making presumptions

44:29.940 --> 44:35.320
The only information we have is been basically handed to us by yeah one one side of the party

44:35.320 --> 44:37.320
Yeah, so you want to be a little careful on that?

44:37.320 --> 44:43.520
But that's a tough. I don't know if there's a whole lot to add. Yeah, and and I think you know it so the straw poll

44:43.520 --> 44:46.040
We I think it was somebody a corkier

44:46.040 --> 44:50.880
Somebody started a straw poll in the Linux action show subreddit to see do you guys care about this topic?

44:50.960 --> 44:54.520
You know because one of my concerns is do we even should we even be talking about this at all?

44:54.720 --> 44:58.320
Obviously it's getting coverage. It seems to be a popular topic for some people

44:58.320 --> 45:02.640
yeah, and I feel like it seems like we're not paying attention if I

45:03.080 --> 45:04.800
Feel like it comes off that we're not paying attention

45:04.800 --> 45:10.000
If the number one thing in Linux is being talked about all over the internet, and we're like we gloss right over it

45:10.000 --> 45:13.000
Yeah, so right now of 58% of the votes say yes

45:13.000 --> 45:15.480
They do care and 37% of the votes say they don't care

45:15.480 --> 45:20.660
And not only 71 votes of art because it hasn't been a very popular thread, but there's a link in the chat room right now

45:21.280 --> 45:28.100
We'll continue to follow to see if there's been any interesting developments outside of just additional drama like any maybe statements from the canonical guys

45:28.100 --> 45:34.780
Oh and also blast so thank you for breaking down the structure of the Ubuntu Community Council that I was good insight today

45:34.780 --> 45:39.140
I was very good to have because it does seem pretty connected to come out canonical basically

45:39.140 --> 45:41.500
It's Mark Shuttleworth and seven people Mark Shuttleworth likes yeah

45:42.180 --> 45:48.060
Well, but hold on because it's not actually from canonical right yeah, yeah, the name is not in there

45:48.140 --> 45:51.700
So there are currently so here's here's how it goes just for those of you

45:51.700 --> 45:52.660
I'm making fun

45:52.660 --> 45:59.780
But the the Ubuntu Community Council consists of eight people one of them is Mark Shuttleworth and seven seven others are nominated by Mark

45:59.780 --> 46:04.460
Shuttleworth and elected by the community for a term of two years currently

46:04.460 --> 46:09.740
There are two canonical employees Michael Hall and Daniel Halbach and one canonical ex-employee Laura

46:10.260 --> 46:17.700
Kozinski the canonical owner himself Mark Shuttleworth and four others from the community one of the roles of the Ubuntu Community Council is to resolve

46:17.700 --> 46:20.140
issues of violation of the CoC

46:20.140 --> 46:25.240
community with code of conduct okay and community disputes with the participation involved members, so

46:26.100 --> 46:31.620
It does kind of seem like a stack deck a bit, but I mean it was there were elections. Yeah, yeah

46:31.620 --> 46:37.320
I guess I don't have a problem with them saying this is not an official canonical thing

46:37.320 --> 46:39.220
And it's not the official word of canonical

46:39.220 --> 46:41.260
I don't have a problem with that what I do have a problem is

46:41.700 --> 46:46.220
When people want to try and remove it so far as to say canonical has nothing to do with this

46:46.220 --> 46:47.460
I mean, it's not a canonical thing

46:47.460 --> 46:52.740
It's totally separate that is come on first of all canonical controls the branding of Ubuntu second of all

46:53.100 --> 46:57.820
The head of the community or the member of the board on the Community Council is the head of canonical

46:57.820 --> 47:02.860
So there's definitely a connection there. There's more than a passing connection there. I agree yeah

47:03.500 --> 47:07.300
All right, so David M. Wrightson with a question about open susa. He says hi

47:07.540 --> 47:10.220
I'm just wondering why you don't mention open susa as an option

47:10.220 --> 47:13.820
I can understand why you don't like Ubuntu and arch is cool, but it's not for production

47:13.820 --> 47:20.620
I enjoy your shows. I plan on making contribution next penny. Oh, that's nice. Thanks David, so he's asking about open susa as an option and

47:21.700 --> 47:24.820
Do you want to take well the reason the reason actually I put that in there was because so

47:24.940 --> 47:27.160
He says that arch doesn't belong in production

47:27.160 --> 47:30.260
And you know what if you would ask me before I had spent time in the studio

47:30.260 --> 47:32.860
I would have agreed with him I would have said listen I would not put fedora

47:32.860 --> 47:35.380
I would not put arch on on a production machine

47:35.380 --> 47:39.220
I don't want something that I knew I want my I want to treat the production machine

47:39.420 --> 47:43.340
Essentially like I treat my KitchenAid mixer on the face of it. It actually seems obvious

47:43.340 --> 47:45.900
Yeah, I just want it to be in appliance once I get it working

47:45.900 --> 47:51.500
I never want to touch it again unless the hardware fails right and then I will do something right in practice though in practice

47:52.140 --> 47:54.140
The total opposite has proved to be true

47:54.660 --> 48:00.500
Numerous numerous times so much so to the point that even though I really wanted to put a bunch of matte on here

48:00.500 --> 48:03.580
I don't dare open my mouth because because I know

48:04.700 --> 48:08.880
Basically, I know that three weeks after I leave some update is gonna come in here

48:08.880 --> 48:11.320
And even if we try not to update it somehow that stupid updater

48:11.320 --> 48:16.900
You know rolls back up, and then it's something somebody or we have to install something else you have to update exactly something happens

48:16.900 --> 48:17.860
That's something that's updated

48:17.860 --> 48:18.020
Yeah

48:18.020 --> 48:25.260
And then something breaks and now because it's so far gone not just one thing breaks like three different things happen at the exact same

48:25.260 --> 48:26.580
Time and you don't know if they're connected

48:26.580 --> 48:31.220
Yeah, or if they're separate and all of a sudden you've got problems like every time you reboot your sound cards get remapped right?

48:31.620 --> 48:37.140
And so and I've I have argued that perhaps in media production because of the underlying stuff

48:37.140 --> 48:42.580
We rely on needs to be so current all the time that Linux by its very nature just as difficult in these kinds of roles

48:42.580 --> 48:46.460
And so maybe being more current is more helpful. Yeah, so open Sousa offers

48:46.460 --> 48:53.100
You know tumbleweed and also evergreen releases so open Sousa has potentially that sweet spot right where open Sousa could

48:53.660 --> 48:58.580
Fill a role on a machine that needs to be uber current and it could fill a role on a machine that needs to that could

48:58.580 --> 49:04.500
Stay fairly static like say my bonobo. Yeah, and so but you don't use open Sousa in enterprise

49:04.500 --> 49:08.620
You don't use open Sousa in your personal stuff. Why is it not really ever been a contender for you?

49:08.620 --> 49:10.000
So there's a couple of things

49:10.000 --> 49:15.300
I I actually really like the idea of an RPM based distro that I could use in production because really I'm not gonna put

49:15.660 --> 49:17.660
I'm not gonna put fedora or at least

49:18.100 --> 49:23.780
That might be changing now, but got a year ago or so. I wouldn't have put fedora into production on on on a client's machine

49:25.260 --> 49:28.180
However, we tried open Sousa in one client

49:28.180 --> 49:31.660
I was gonna go out and we were gonna do that and I ended up bringing him a test machine

49:31.660 --> 49:37.260
We set it up, but it had this weird thing where it will show the it when you click on

49:37.860 --> 49:41.180
You plug a thumb drive in it will show up as if it's mounted

49:41.180 --> 49:45.500
but it doesn't actually create the mount point and show the files from a from a from a

49:46.100 --> 49:51.500
removable storage and they had some sort of script that that kicked off that did something when somebody plugged a thumb drive in and

49:51.620 --> 49:56.860
It wasn't the script kept failing because this thing wasn't mounting and I worked with it a little bit and I couldn't get it

49:56.860 --> 49:58.460
To work and I said eventually just screw it

49:58.460 --> 50:02.660
We'll just go to a bunch of because the reality was everything else they were doing other than this one tiny little piece of software

50:03.220 --> 50:05.840
Which we could which had both RPM and Deb

50:06.540 --> 50:11.320
Was all being done in the browser, you know, so I just went with that's that's an interesting reason not to use it

50:11.320 --> 50:16.580
Uh Mike's a little more nuanced. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so I I actually thought I would be sitting here and

50:17.140 --> 50:18.380
I

50:18.380 --> 50:21.100
Thought I thought I thought by this point in time

50:21.660 --> 50:27.460
Open Sousa would be the far-gone conclusion because the build service was so awesome. They have

50:27.460 --> 50:29.940
a tumbleweed they have their evergreen releases

50:29.940 --> 50:33.860
I'm still a fan of yast and yet I sit here and I think I

50:34.260 --> 50:37.460
Don't know still a bit of an unfinished mess rotten corpse. What's your take on it?

50:38.700 --> 50:39.900
I would say that

50:39.900 --> 50:45.020
Open Sousa has like a ton of potential and they do a lot of things that make you are really interested in them

50:45.100 --> 50:48.260
But then they kind of fall short and the actual

50:48.940 --> 50:51.300
Production of this stuff like for example, the OBS is cool

50:51.780 --> 50:56.500
But then they don't have any focus on it and it's very clunky and it requires specific

50:56.500 --> 51:02.860
Files and configurations that you have to know in order to send something to the OBS and then they have like the Sousa studio

51:02.860 --> 51:08.140
Which is cool, but not a very good environment to reuse and they have like there's

51:08.700 --> 51:13.200
One click install that's actually like 12, right or whatever. I very clunky

51:13.780 --> 51:19.020
Yeah, they have a lot of great ideas, but they never actually like they don't all come to fruition

51:19.020 --> 51:25.860
I actually don't think any of them really fully come to fruition and it's just like it's really cool and then disappointing

51:25.860 --> 51:31.580
Yeah, and I think a lot of the changes around zipper and the package manager for a few releases a while ago

51:31.980 --> 51:37.300
Sort of I lost momentum on my open Sousa edge like I had I for a while

51:37.300 --> 51:41.580
I ran Sousa Enterprise Linux in a in a on a quite a few servers

51:41.580 --> 51:45.500
I thought I thought it made and it was so great because you know

51:45.500 --> 51:50.480
You could have it was so easy to make to make a Samba file server with Sousa Linux

51:50.480 --> 51:56.520
Using the asked it would connect to the domain and authenticate all of the users and set up all the permissions and you could set

51:56.520 --> 52:01.920
up extended attributes on all the file systems because Sousa was super easy with riser FS and XFS out of the box back then and

52:01.920 --> 52:05.560
It was just like I could drop a Sousa box in within 10 minutes

52:05.560 --> 52:10.800
I'd have it connected and authenticating to a Windows domain controller and I'd have it all updated in Yast and it was

52:11.200 --> 52:17.200
Beautiful. Yeah, and for a while I even used this program from the Zemarian folks to manage all of the it was called red carpet

52:17.200 --> 52:22.280
And I could manage all of the patches on all of my Sousa boxes from one GTK console on one desktop

52:22.280 --> 52:26.840
And it was so amazing and when they went through all these package manager changes

52:26.840 --> 52:32.600
I just really lost momentum on all of that and and then and I just kind of I kind of fell into

52:32.920 --> 52:34.920
back into apt-get and

52:35.000 --> 52:40.360
Ubuntu for a long time and it just seems like such a more streamlined process to manage your packages then

52:40.640 --> 52:45.880
And and there's so many layers on the open Sousa side. Mm-hmm. And then the other thing that's given me a

52:45.880 --> 52:47.720
little bit of

52:47.720 --> 52:54.840
Cold feet with Sousa is I'm not very comfortable with their parent company and I'm not very comfortable how they've been passed around in the

52:54.840 --> 53:00.240
Last few years and I'm not super clear on what the parent company's priority is for Sousa Linux other than making a distro

53:00.240 --> 53:05.640
That is a companion piece to mainframes type software and I so and I'm sure that's not their purpose and vision

53:05.640 --> 53:08.120
I just I have I feel like they haven't articulated it yet

53:08.120 --> 53:10.880
And so I'm not willing to invest a lot of my personal energy into that

53:10.880 --> 53:11.160
Yeah

53:11.160 --> 53:17.760
The one thing that I see that open Sousa really really digs down on is if I had a if somebody came to me

53:17.760 --> 53:19.160
And they said I had a lot of experience

53:19.160 --> 53:23.400
Administrating a Windows server and I want to switch the Linux server. What should I start with man?

53:23.400 --> 53:29.080
Yeah, it is in it and it and it and and Sousa such a capable distro open

53:29.080 --> 53:33.400
Sousa such a capable distro that I think it has a lot of but you know

53:33.400 --> 53:36.900
Here's the other thing too. If you were gonna use open Sousa, would you not use KDE?

53:36.900 --> 53:42.660
Because it's a really nice KDE implementation really nice. Yeah, and KDE is

53:42.660 --> 53:46.140
Yeah, they have a good gnome one too. I mean they do overall they do good work

53:46.140 --> 53:50.300
And one of the things I like is like Yast is like a Qt UI on KDE and GTK UI under gnome

53:50.300 --> 53:52.700
Like they do a lot of good stuff

53:52.700 --> 53:56.780
It's just it all doesn't really come together to make it super compelling but heavens

53:56.780 --> 53:59.380
I'll give you a chance to give them a bit of cred here

53:59.380 --> 54:06.380
Yes, trying to judge the desktop usage of open Sousa based on their open build service is not exactly

54:06.380 --> 54:13.860
Doing it justice. I do use open Sousa at least in a couple virtual machines just to test and make sure that it is up to snuff

54:13.860 --> 54:19.060
At least in my standards. It is up to my standards in terms of desktop usage

54:19.060 --> 54:24.060
In every way the zipper package manager, even though it is a little bit different from RPM

54:24.060 --> 54:30.060
But in terms of RPM distros, open Sousa is the only one that I kind of like

54:30.060 --> 54:37.060
Yeah, but yeah, I don't know. It's just a monthly for a deb or pac-man kind of usage

54:37.060 --> 54:46.060
But I don't think it has much to... you can't blame it based on its other services

54:46.060 --> 54:51.060
Even though yes, it should work, but one thing, one installation of open Sousa

54:51.060 --> 54:58.060
It should work, but one install package manager or at least one click install packages is useful for users

54:58.060 --> 55:08.060
The package search is useful for users, adding extra repos, especially with GPG based repository authentication is useful

55:08.060 --> 55:12.060
And you know, it's nice

55:12.060 --> 55:16.060
That's not even the problem. The problem is the whole package

55:16.060 --> 55:21.060
Like there's a lot of cool things and they make really good ideas with the package search

55:21.060 --> 55:25.060
And basically everything is on the website you can install from. Really cool

55:25.060 --> 55:28.060
But it's just funky when you actually go through the process

55:28.060 --> 55:32.060
I think I'm done on this topic. No, no, hold on. Let's talk about more in the post-show

55:32.060 --> 55:34.060
Because I don't want to spend too much more time in the show on this topic

55:34.060 --> 55:37.060
Because honestly, here's where I kind of come down on open Sousa

55:37.060 --> 55:39.060
That's why I don't want to spend a lot more time on it

55:39.060 --> 55:42.060
Is despite as much as I wish this wasn't the case

55:42.060 --> 55:45.060
And despite as much as a lot of people in the community who really love this distribution

55:45.060 --> 55:48.060
Wish it wasn't the case and the people who work for the company wish it wasn't the case

55:48.060 --> 55:51.060
I believe the reality is, and I'm sorry I have to say this

55:51.060 --> 55:54.060
This is the final word for this episode on the topic and we can take other

55:54.060 --> 55:58.060
I just need to move on from this. I'm getting orange on the topic. Red, really

55:58.060 --> 56:03.060
But I unfortunately do not believe that open Sousa really makes much of an impact in the market

56:03.060 --> 56:05.060
In the industry, they don't really move the needle when they make an initiative

56:05.060 --> 56:07.060
Nobody really pays attention except for them

56:07.060 --> 56:11.060
They're not super relevant, not like Ubuntu or Fedora or even Arch

56:11.060 --> 56:16.060
Or honestly, definitely distributions like Debian and Slackware even

56:16.060 --> 56:19.060
I don't know, there are just a lot of distributions out there

56:19.060 --> 56:24.060
That I feel like when they say something, it makes a huge, huge wave

56:24.060 --> 56:28.060
Like when Debian decided to switch to System D, holy shit, right?

56:28.060 --> 56:30.060
When Sousa switched to System D, do you know when that was?

56:30.060 --> 56:35.060
No. In fact, I wasn't even aware that they'd switched to System D, to be honest with you

56:35.060 --> 56:38.060
Right, they did a while ago, right? That's my point

56:38.060 --> 56:41.060
And I wish it wasn't that way, and that's why, to be honest with you

56:41.060 --> 56:43.060
As somebody who's an enthusiast about this market

56:43.060 --> 56:45.060
I like to use a distro that's a little bit more relevant

56:45.060 --> 56:48.060
That has a little sway, not a lot, I don't want a lot of drama

56:48.060 --> 56:52.060
But I do like to have a distro that has some solid relevancy in the areas I care about

56:52.060 --> 56:54.060
I just don't feel like that's where open Sousa's at

56:54.060 --> 56:56.060
And that's my final word on it

56:56.060 --> 56:59.060
So, Harold writes in about Angela's Yoga 3

56:59.060 --> 57:02.060
And he says, I'd like to move my wife to Linux as well

57:02.060 --> 57:05.060
But how do we sync an iPhone or iPad to iTunes using Linux?

57:05.060 --> 57:09.060
That's her greatest stumbling block. He also wants to know what spreadsheet program she uses

57:09.060 --> 57:11.060
A lot to choose from

57:11.060 --> 57:15.060
So, it's funny that he writes in and asks that, right?

57:15.060 --> 57:21.060
Because, just like, I think, Friday

57:21.060 --> 57:23.060
It was Friday, we were working on show notes

57:23.060 --> 57:26.060
And you said, hey, while we're working on that, you know what would be awesome?

57:26.060 --> 57:30.060
If you could get Angela's iPhone to sync up to...

57:30.060 --> 57:35.060
She's like, I'm basically doing almost everything on the Yoga, except, you know what?

57:35.060 --> 57:39.060
I take pictures with my iPhone, and when I plug it in, nothing happens

57:39.060 --> 57:41.060
And I thought, oh, yeah, that's right

57:41.060 --> 57:44.060
We never went back around to get that working

57:44.060 --> 57:47.060
We talked about it on the show, and then I just...

57:47.060 --> 57:52.060
I forget that there's still people pulling photos off their phones using USB

57:52.060 --> 57:55.060
I just think when you take pictures, it syncs to something

57:55.060 --> 57:57.060
And she talked about using Dropbox and OwnCloud

57:57.060 --> 58:00.060
But none of them, she takes so many pictures, and they're fairly high resolution

58:00.060 --> 58:03.060
She likes being able to plug it in, have them suck off the device

58:03.060 --> 58:06.060
And then delete them off the camera roll of the device

58:06.060 --> 58:09.060
But the fundamental problem is you have to get the Linux box to recognize the iPhone

58:09.060 --> 58:11.060
And this has got to be a common problem in our audience

58:11.060 --> 58:14.060
Right, so the answer's actually fairly straightforward

58:14.060 --> 58:16.060
There's two or three packages you need to install

58:16.060 --> 58:17.060
We'll have a link in the show notes to them

58:17.060 --> 58:20.060
But they have, once you get those packages installed

58:20.060 --> 58:23.060
What it allows you to do is mount the phone as either an MTP device

58:23.060 --> 58:25.060
Or actually mount it as a drive

58:25.060 --> 58:28.060
Now, we actually set it up so that it mounts as a drive

58:28.060 --> 58:30.060
But it doesn't have right access to the phone

58:30.060 --> 58:31.060
And the reason for that is...

58:31.060 --> 58:32.060
We want to be careful

58:32.060 --> 58:35.060
We want to be careful, and she's had problems in the past where

58:35.060 --> 58:40.060
She does something on Linux thinking that she is just making copies of her photos

58:40.060 --> 58:41.060
And in fact it's moving them

58:41.060 --> 58:43.060
Here there's no possibility it can move them

58:43.060 --> 58:45.060
The only thing it can do is copy them

58:45.060 --> 58:48.060
Now, you can actually set it up so that inside of Shotwell

58:48.060 --> 58:51.060
It looks when a given mount point is mounted

58:51.060 --> 58:54.060
So when slash media slash Ange's iPhone mounts

58:54.060 --> 58:56.060
It will automatically look inside of that directory

58:56.060 --> 59:00.060
And then the DCIM folder to sync up all of the photos

59:00.060 --> 59:01.060
That's not a hard set

59:01.060 --> 59:03.060
No, and so the nice thing for her is she just plugs her phone in

59:03.060 --> 59:05.060
And somehow all of her pictures will magically populate in Shotwell

59:05.060 --> 59:08.060
And she actually likes the idea too that it's in the file manager

59:08.060 --> 59:11.060
So if she just wanted a single photo to post online or something

59:11.060 --> 59:12.060
Right

59:12.060 --> 59:13.060
Or send it to me over Telegram

59:13.060 --> 59:15.060
So that would be mounting it

59:15.060 --> 59:16.060
And yeah, you're right

59:16.060 --> 59:18.060
So she can log in there and just manually copy that photo out

59:18.060 --> 59:20.060
But it actually really took, what?

59:20.060 --> 59:21.060
It took five minutes

59:21.060 --> 59:23.060
And four of those minutes were researching it

59:23.060 --> 59:24.060
And 30 seconds were implementing it

59:24.060 --> 59:27.060
You know, so the Librem is on the verge of shipping

59:27.060 --> 59:29.060
July, I think, yeah

59:29.060 --> 59:31.060
The XPS 13 is very solid

59:31.060 --> 59:32.060
The Yoga is very solid

59:32.060 --> 59:35.060
Dell's got this new $250 laptop

59:36.060 --> 59:38.060
Yeah, Linux is big

59:38.060 --> 59:40.060
Yeah, and that doesn't even count

59:40.060 --> 59:43.060
Like, System76 has their best Bonobo Extreme yet

59:43.060 --> 59:44.060
Like, that thing's a monster

59:44.060 --> 59:45.060
They're shipping the Meerkat

59:45.060 --> 59:47.060
There's a great ton of options desktop-wise for System76

59:47.060 --> 59:48.060
The Galago is amazing

59:48.060 --> 59:51.060
You have like, this is the best year for Linux laptops ever

59:51.060 --> 59:52.060
Yeah

59:52.060 --> 59:55.060
And a lot of these are shipping with very good Intel graphics

59:55.060 --> 59:57.060
There are plenty good for average users

59:57.060 --> 59:59.060
And for those of us who want to have dedicated graphics

59:59.060 --> 01:00:00.060
Those options are available too

01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:02.060
Yeah, but really, if you think about it

01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:06.060
The Intel embedded graphics are really what have kind of driven this market so far forward

01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:09.060
Because now you don't need to have dedicated

01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:12.060
Before, like five years ago, when you bought your original Bonobo

01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:14.060
I bet you, like, buying integrated graphics would have been a joke

01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:15.060
It was not an option

01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:16.060
Because you can't get anything done on it

01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:17.060
Not even possible

01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:18.060
You can't game

01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:19.060
And I couldn't use OBS

01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:23.060
And this thing has to drive, this thing has to mirror the display out to the capture machine

01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:24.060
So how are you going to do that with integrated graphics?

01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:28.060
How can I play any, how can I show any video games under Linux with integrated graphics back then

01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:30.060
And then also mirror the display 1080p

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:32.060
Right, and now, and now look at that tiny little nook over there

01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:33.060
Yeah, it's doing it

01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:34.060
Does the same freaking thing

01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:35.060
I know, I know, I know

01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:37.060
So yeah, they have gotten, it's gotten light years better

01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:39.060
And it's only going to improve

01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:40.060
Yeah

01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:41.060
In fact, one might even wonder

01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:46.060
At least in the mobile sphere where you want a thin, portable, powerful laptop

01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:47.060
Yeah

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:51.060
At some point, do we just stop putting, do we stop putting up our graphics on

01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:54.060
For the purpose of getting that laptop down a little bit in size and compact

01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:57.060
If integrated graphics get a little bit better

01:00:57.060 --> 01:00:59.060
That's why I had a great hope for Thunderbolt

01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:01.060
I wanted to be able to have an integrated graphics laptop

01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:03.060
And then hook up an external GPU and have at it

01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:04.060
Yeah

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:05.060
But, yeah, we'll see

01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:06.060
Alienware's got something like that

01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:09.060
You know, so integrated graphics have been changing the game

01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:11.060
For portability on the Intel-based machines

01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:13.060
The, you know, the amount of performance you can get it

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:16.060
It's the same thing as sort of in the server space like DigitalOcean has done

01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:17.060
That's our next sponsor

01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:20.060
Where they've taken something and they've been able to get it to a price that's just unbelievable

01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:22.060
Five dollars a month for your own server at DigitalOcean

01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:23.060
It's incredible

01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:27.060
And when you use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED, one word, you're going to get a ten dollar credit

01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:29.060
What, what, what, what?

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:31.060
You don't know what DigitalOcean is

01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:37.060
DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way for you

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:38.060
To spin up your own cloud server

01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:39.060
How about that Noah?

01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:40.060
That's pretty cool

01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:41.060
Did you know that?

01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:42.060
I didn't know that

01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:43.060
Tell me about DigitalOcean

01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:45.060
It's not like I have like 30 droplets

01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:50.060
It's not like I had to email DigitalOcean and ask them to expand my droplet offering so that I could get more droplets

01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:51.060
Freaking, that didn't happen

01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:53.060
Game freaking changer

01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:54.060
That's what DigitalOcean is

01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:56.060
Game freaking changer

01:01:56.060 --> 01:02:00.060
I can't even imagine if I was doing what Noah does as a day job and DigitalOcean was around

01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:02.060
It would change how my business was structured

01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:03.060
I mean, actually

01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:04.060
You would have made a lot more money

01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:06.060
Well, yeah, absolutely

01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:12.060
And in a way, like, now I think about some of the stuff we're doing server side for Jupiter Broadcasting

01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:14.060
And how would I have done that before DigitalOcean

01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:17.060
You either had rented rack space

01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:18.060
Yeah

01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:22.060
You would have either had to rent an actual dedicated server which would cost you like a couple hundred dollars a month

01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:25.060
Or like go crazy and I could maybe set up a server here

01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:26.060
Okay, alright, let's talk about that

01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:27.060
But then I got bandwidth problems

01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:28.060
Hold on

01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:29.060
Comcast

01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:33.060
Before you ever get to the bandwidth problems, you got to come up with 2500 macaroons

01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:34.060
To get the rig

01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:35.060
To get the server

01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:37.060
And oftentimes, that's not even going to include

01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:39.060
You're going to want to put some solid state drives in there

01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:40.060
Well, and if this thing is

01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:41.060
Yeah, and these things are

01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:45.060
And these things like, so there's a lot of automated backend functionality

01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:47.060
If this doesn't work, shows don't go out

01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:49.060
So I'm going dual, I'm going redundant power

01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:51.060
I'm going to go hardware drive array

01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:52.060
Okay

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:54.060
Then I'm setting this box up myself

01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:56.060
Now still, you're counting on a couple things

01:02:56.060 --> 01:02:58.060
One, you still have the risk of a hardware failure

01:02:58.060 --> 01:02:59.060
Even if it's redundant

01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:00.060
Yeah

01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:01.060
They're still, they're going to be

01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:02.060
Or a Comcast outage

01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:04.060
Okay, so we haven't gotten to bandwidth

01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:06.060
First, the server itself can die

01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:08.060
Second, you might have a bandwidth issue

01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:10.060
And third, what about your expandability

01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:12.060
In two years, in a year, it's dead

01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:13.060
And you can't upgrade that thing

01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:15.060
Or what if the network starts growing really crazy fast

01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:16.060
Then what am I going to do?

01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:17.060
Then I'm going to stop that money because I'm going to replace it anyway

01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:18.060
What I'm telling you is

01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:22.060
And that doesn't even settle the fact that I'm going to probably need to set up like a DMZ on the firewall

01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:23.060
Get that all wired in

01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:25.060
Get the firewall rules all set up

01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:28.060
But even if all that worked perfectly and nothing ever went wrong

01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:30.060
Which, let's face it, what's the chances of that happening?

01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:31.060
Thanks

01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:32.060
Even if nothing, wow

01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:35.060
That's because you need us, Rekai and I to come in here and do some wiring for you

01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:38.060
But if that happened, it would probably have a decent chance of staying up

01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:39.060
Oh

01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:40.060
Oh really?

01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:41.060
Let's go with that every week

01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:42.060
Let's go with that again

01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:46.060
Even if all of the hardware functioned for a year or two

01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:49.060
At the end of that two years, now you have to do all over again

01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:50.060
And you have to set all that crap up again

01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:51.060
It's ridiculous

01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:53.060
And meanwhile, DigitalOcean's over here

01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:56.060
They're going to get you going in less than 55 seconds when you spin up a Dropbox

01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:57.060
Five bucks

01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:58.060
For $5 a month

01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:02.060
You get your 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU, and a terabyte of transfer

01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:06.060
But it's a terabyte of transfer at like tier one data centers with unbelievable connections

01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:12.060
They have data centers in New York, they have ones in San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, London, and Germany

01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:14.060
It is really nice

01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:17.060
And then the best part is, and I wouldn't get this if I rolled my own rig

01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:19.060
They have an amazing interface to manage it all

01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:21.060
They really have a super intuitive control panel

01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:25.060
And you can get all kinds of additional functionality on your own using their API

01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:28.060
And I'm thinking like create your machines, obviously destroy them, duplicate them

01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:32.060
Make backups of them before you make a big system change with a really nice snapshot system

01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:35.060
Full feature DNS management allows you to easily manage your domain

01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:37.060
Snapshots are a great function

01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:39.060
Now they're not just like backup

01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:42.060
These are like full, this is a great way to deploy servers

01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:44.060
Like you get a server set up just the way you want, you snapshot, you make it a template

01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:47.060
You want to snapshot something and send it off to another customer

01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:49.060
Hey, here let me set you up a WordPress machine

01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:50.060
Think about this you guys

01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:54.060
You could go over there and have a Droplet that you set up with like a perfect ghost installation

01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:55.060
All set up for customers

01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:57.060
And you could sell it

01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:59.060
You could sell that, like make that a service

01:04:59.060 --> 01:05:00.060
And re-host it

01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:03.060
And DigitalOcean has referral programs and all kinds of things

01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:05.060
A really great offering for the customers too

01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:07.060
They've structured in a way to incentivize you as well

01:05:07.060 --> 01:05:11.060
So go check out some of those options like their one-click installations that make the control panel super nice

01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:15.060
And by the way, tons of job openings right now

01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:19.060
They've asked me specifically to mention that they're looking for some of the best Linux admins out there

01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:20.060
To keep them in the right place

01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:21.060
I know

01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:24.060
And they also want to get some content editors because they're doubling down once again

01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:28.060
They're doing another like big push on their content for their community tutorials and whatnot

01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:29.060
They're willing to pay people

01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:36.060
And you know the real secret to DigitalOcean is a lot of these tutorials are not necessarily DigitalOcean specific

01:05:36.060 --> 01:05:38.060
Like how to set up an SSH key

01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:40.060
Look how well this is done

01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:42.060
Look how clear this is

01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:44.060
That is super nice

01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:45.060
That is super clean

01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:49.060
And none of this, none of this is specific to a DigitalOcean Droplet

01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:52.060
Yeah, that's the super nice thing right

01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:55.060
Is that they have those set up as just we want to help people

01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:58.060
We're going to set this up and provide that information to you

01:05:58.060 --> 01:06:00.060
They look at all of that as like a whole product

01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:01.060
They really do

01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:05.060
Because when they rolled out free BSD support, they rolled out a whole bunch of tutorials with it

01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:07.060
They don't want you to just sit there and have a Droplet

01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:09.060
They want you to really get some use out of it

01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:10.060
That's really cool

01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:13.060
And they have great products built around that API too

01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:15.060
Like you've tried out the Swimmer app

01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:16.060
Mist.io is really cool

01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:20.060
Command.io, you can manage your DigitalOcean Droplets using the command line

01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:21.060
You know what's interesting

01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:24.060
You're talking about that control panel being easy to use and intuitive

01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:28.060
The other part of it is for people like me who I do the same repetitive task over and over again

01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:32.060
I'm not using a lot of their features of clicking this and changing that and modify

01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:35.060
I'm going to do all that from the command line once I SSH in, right

01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:40.060
For me, once I log in, it's like three clicks to get stuff rolling

01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:44.060
And then I just, I have the IP address and I throw that in my DNS server

01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:46.060
And now I can access that machine

01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:50.060
And like you said, I didn't get a chance to show it on Sunday

01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:53.060
But the way that you can set it up with SSH keys, they just have a button

01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:56.060
So I can check nose lanyard, nose laptop

01:06:56.060 --> 01:06:58.060
And then when I spin up a DigitalOcean Droplet

01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:00.060
Boom, I can instantly have access to it

01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:02.060
I don't have to wait for the email to come through

01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:03.060
Do you remember when I had that problem here

01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:06.060
And then my email went down so I couldn't get the email

01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:08.060
That took me what, 30 seconds to set that up?

01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:09.060
It's very nice

01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:10.060
Yeah, it's quick, it's easy

01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:12.060
You've never had a better experience

01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:15.060
Because usually what you have to do is you have to SSH into the computer

01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:16.060
And you have to enter this huge long password

01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:18.060
Then you have to run all these stupid commands

01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:22.060
And copying an SSH key is not as easy as you might think it is

01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:24.060
Because you can't have any spaces, you can't modify it

01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:25.060
It's just a pain

01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:26.060
There I click a button

01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:27.060
One button

01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:28.060
And now I have my SSH key

01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:31.060
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED

01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:33.060
One word and I'll get you a $10 credit

01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:35.060
Tried that $5 rig for two months for free

01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:37.060
You'd be surprised what you can do with it

01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:41.060
I have so many things I actually frequently forget all the things I'm using it for

01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:44.060
It's amazing how much I've integrated into my life

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:46.060
And how hassle free that is

01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:49.060
DigitalOcean.com is so cool to have your own server up there that rocks

01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:51.060
And you could use it for so many things

01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:55.060
Alright Mr. Noah, I want to talk a little bit about Gnome 3.18

01:07:55.060 --> 01:07:58.060
Major updates are coming for Gnome 3.18

01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:00.060
And of course we're going to see that land in a little while

01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:04.060
But probably the ones we should talk about today is the changes coming to the files

01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:06.060
You know the old Nautilus application

01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:09.060
It's going to bring numerous under the hood and user visible changes

01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:11.060
It also fixes bugs that have been reported by users for a while now

01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:15.060
So fix for window focus issues that have occurred with the file manager

01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:17.060
Handling the command line options in certain areas

01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:20.060
They're going to also introduce a public API for files

01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:22.060
To allow for plugins to be written

01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:26.060
And a documentation for developers to create those extensions as well will be released

01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:28.060
Interface has added some modifications

01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:30.060
They've added padding on the window list and views

01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:31.060
And things like that

01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:32.060
I'm going to show you a picture of it

01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:34.060
Oh, they took the picture down

01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:36.060
Well good thing I put that in the show notes

01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:39.060
We do have, I do have, here's another copy of it

01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:40.060
And I'll zoom in

01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:42.060
I don't know if you can see Noah, a little bit here

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:45.060
But they're adding some, like when you create a new folder

01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:47.060
This pop down area here is new

01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:49.060
They've cleaned up this area here and added some padding

01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:51.060
And the search area has been changed a little bit

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:55.060
So files is getting quite a bit of attention in GNOME 3.18

01:08:57.060 --> 01:08:59.060
No, I'm just, I'm looking and I'm thinking

01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:01.060
I kind of, you know, I'm all about innovation

01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:02.060
I think that's great

01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:04.060
I'm glad that we're always trying to move forward

01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:07.060
And I can always appreciate a company that attempts to be innovative

01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:09.060
Even if I don't always agree with the innovations

01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:13.060
But like, I don't know if I want to create my folder up in the menu

01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:15.060
I think I want to, I think I want to create a folder

01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:16.060
Like I want to right click and create a folder

01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:18.060
Or if I have to go up here and create a new folder

01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:19.060
You still build it right click

01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:21.060
But yeah, have you checked out Nemo?

01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:22.060
No

01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:24.060
Nemo is a fork of the Noddle's file manager

01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:26.060
Started by the Cinnamon Project, I believe

01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:28.060
And it's pretty good

01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:30.060
I don't know, Noah

01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:32.060
No, I care

01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:34.060
See, Greater says, wow, GNOME 3 will bring updated apps

01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:36.060
It's incredible, who cares?

01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:39.060
I feel like we can be such dicks in the open source community

01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:43.060
Like, are we so callous that we have stopped caring

01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:46.060
That a desktop that was down on the ropes

01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:48.060
That people thought was a failed desktop initiative

01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:53.060
Is now coming out with incredible updates that are genuinely impressive

01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:57.060
And in some cases, more trend setting than any other desktop on the market

01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:58.060
I mean, look at Yosemite

01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:02.060
Yosemite and some of the UI changes they made there were direct rip offs of GNOME 3

01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:04.060
You look at some of the changes in Windows 10

01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:07.060
And the way they're managing virtual desktops and things like that

01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:09.060
Very much a rip off of the way they do things in GNOME 3

01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:13.060
I think GNOME 3 has been a trend setter

01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:18.060
And I think GNOME 3.16 is the best full desktop environment for Linux

01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:21.060
I say you stack, Plasma 5 is getting great

01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:22.060
But it's still not there yet

01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:24.060
It's still not there yet

01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:27.060
As far as a full featured, complete modern desktop

01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:30.060
I'm not talking about your Awesomes and your Exmonads

01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:33.060
I'm talking about, you know, a real full red blooded desktop

01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:35.060
Nothing is beating GNOME 3.16

01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:38.060
And I think it's a little sad that as a community we don't give them enough recognition

01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:41.060
The updates they have made are genuinely reflecting user feedback

01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:43.060
They're genuine improvements

01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:46.060
And as somebody who has used desktops since we have had graphical environments

01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:51.060
Literally, I have been using desktop computing since GUIs were a thing for mass adoption

01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:56.060
And I, in my personal opinion, have never used a better graphical environment in 30 years of using computers

01:10:56.060 --> 01:10:58.060
Okay, so let me take the other side of it

01:10:58.060 --> 01:11:00.060
If only for the purpose of discussion

01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:06.060
Why is it that basic things that Unity has are still not implemented in GNOME?

01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:07.060
So I'll give you an example

01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:10.060
When I open the display manager in Unity

01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:13.060
I can choose where I want my launcher bar to be

01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:17.060
If I want it on the far right display, if I want it on the center display, left, in my house I have six

01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:19.060
I can pick which one of those six displays I want it on

01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:23.060
Why is it in GNOME, not only can I do that, I can't set the refresh rate

01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:24.060
I can't set...

01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:25.060
You can't do that in Unity either

01:11:25.060 --> 01:11:26.060
Yeah, I guess that's true

01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:29.060
Now remember, Unity's what, had eight releases now almost? Seven releases?

01:11:29.060 --> 01:11:30.060
Yeah

01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:31.060
So, okay, I'll give you that

01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:33.060
So you're saying they're further on? Is that...

01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:36.060
No, are you not able to set where that...

01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:38.060
Like, I'm able to set where that bar goes

01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:39.060
How?

01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:40.060
In GNOME Tweak

01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:42.060
Okay, well then maybe it's something I'm missing

01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:45.060
I guess where I looked for it was inside of the displays I can't set...

01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:48.060
Oh yeah, maybe the bar, how about the activities menu?

01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:51.060
So what I want is if I have three monitors

01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:54.060
I would prefer that the activities menu be on my far left monitor

01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:58.060
The reason for that is because when I send my mouse up to the far...

01:11:58.060 --> 01:12:02.060
I send it all the way to the end, then I want it to activate the activities menu

01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:05.060
The last time I've done it, the way it sets up

01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:07.060
The activities menu shows up on my center display

01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:10.060
And then when I scroll through my virtual desktops it moves this other monitor

01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:14.060
I feel like we're arguing slightly... I think I'm on another level

01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:16.060
Okay, alright, that could be

01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:22.060
No, what I'm saying is like, I guess don't mistake what I'm saying to say that it's flawless

01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:23.060
Right

01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:24.060
Because that's not possible

01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:25.060
Of course

01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:26.060
What I'm saying is...

01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:27.060
But you said...

01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:29.060
Because what you're talking about is like an esoteric use case, honestly

01:12:29.060 --> 01:12:33.060
You're talking about a three to six monitor setup and you want the activities menu to be...

01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:36.060
Two monitors, and I just want the activities menu on the other monitor

01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:38.060
Well, that's how it works now

01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:41.060
Whatever is your primary monitor is where the activities menu is

01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:42.060
Okay

01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:44.060
So if you have a dual monitor setup and you set activities to be...

01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:46.060
Whatever your primary monitor is, that's where that menu is at

01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:47.060
Okay

01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:51.060
So yeah, you can't say if I have three or four or five or six monitors, I want it on monitor number four

01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:52.060
Alright

01:12:52.060 --> 01:12:56.060
But like, these are also changes that as the desktop matures, they're going to add these refinements back in

01:12:56.060 --> 01:13:01.060
See, and this is the other thing is, the thing that we really crapped on them for was pulling a bunch of features out

01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:03.060
But to be honest with you, they are the developers

01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:07.060
They know what code has been rotten, they know what code needs to go, they know where they want to take things

01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:08.060
And where they need to restart

01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:13.060
And at some point you have to trust that they have some more insights than us users do at some level

01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:16.060
So if you accept that, then perhaps they can do some reduction of functionality

01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:22.060
If you also grant that basically since GNOME 3.10, it's been nothing but adding a bunch of great features that we all wanted back in there

01:13:22.060 --> 01:13:24.060
And with GNOME 3.16, we're really down that path

01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:27.060
And with GNOME 3.18 now, we're going even further down that path

01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:33.060
And I would argue that I also think that we have been way too hard on them for their focus on the touchscreen

01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:37.060
Because now that I have had a couple of users try out, I know, I know, I can't believe I'm saying it either

01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:40.060
I seriously can't believe those words came out of my mouth

01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:43.060
Roll your eyes all you want, because I still think it's also an excessive use

01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:49.060
But the couple of users now, and this is super anecdotal evidence, but the couple of users I've had use the touchscreen laptops

01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:50.060
They all think it's great

01:13:50.060 --> 01:13:53.060
They think it's the, they think it's great

01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:58.060
It is, to Angela, the best thing about her yoga is that she swipes that touchscreen up to unlock it

01:13:58.060 --> 01:14:01.060
To her, that's one of the coolest features on that laptop

01:14:01.060 --> 01:14:04.060
Because these people are primarily mobile users

01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:09.060
So the fact that they can reach out and touch it from time to time is almost an intuitive way to interact with the computer

01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:15.060
So I could see that if the touchscreen in GNOME functioned the way that the touchscreen functions on mobile

01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:18.060
But the reality is I still feel when I touch the touchscreen on GNOME

01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:22.060
I still feel like I have taken a touchscreen and plugged it into a desktop

01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:25.060
I don't feel like I actually have a touch optimized desktop

01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:30.060
Where she's using it is like she touches the activities corner or on the dock launcher or to unlock the screen

01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:32.060
That's about all she uses it for

01:14:32.060 --> 01:14:34.060
I can see unlocking the screen, that feels normal enough

01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:42.060
But even the activities menu is just small enough that I have to like kind of wiggle my finger in the corner to get that to launch

01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:44.060
I don't know, it just doesn't feel

01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:49.060
My perfect desktop would be exactly what GNOME is today, written in QT

01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:53.060
Well okay, so let me take it from another angle then

01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:58.060
If GNOME has done such a good job with the desktop, why do we have to apply so many extensions to make it usable?

01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:01.060
Yeah, that's a fair argument, but can't you say the same thing about Firefox and Chrome?

01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:06.060
Yes, I could, except I don't use any extensions in Firefox, I think it works perfectly right out of the box

01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:08.060
You really don't use many extensions in GNOME though either

01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:11.060
I don't, yeah I don't, I don't, but that's because I'm too lazy to install it

01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:13.060
But it works for you without them

01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:16.060
It does, it does, that's true, I'm not saying it's not usable without extensions

01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:18.060
I'm just saying that, I guess I did just say that

01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:25.060
My approach to the extensions is, I find GNOME irritating to use without them, but usable

01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:31.060
With extensions, it's so in that sweet spot where I've got kind of my cool heads up information that I like to have

01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:35.060
But it's not at the KDE level where I'm constantly tweaking it because the options are there

01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:37.060
It's just that sweet spot

01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:41.060
Until you update the next GNOME and then your extensions are going to break

01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:44.060
But that's been getting better too, I grant you that as well

01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:50.060
But my update from 3.14 to 3.16, I didn't have a single extension that didn't work

01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:55.060
Because either the authors were right on top of it or I think maybe I had one extension that didn't work

01:15:55.060 --> 01:15:57.060
But it's so minimal that it doesn't really matter

01:15:57.060 --> 01:16:00.060
I don't think I could use GNOME without the extensions for a long term

01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:04.060
But for a few days after an update, it's not a big deal

01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:08.060
Now how do you think that that relates to a new user?

01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:15.060
One of the nice things about Ubuntu and Unity is that big dock along the side makes it really, really obvious

01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:19.060
They recognize Firefox, they recognize Chrome

01:16:19.060 --> 01:16:22.060
So when they see those icons, it's pretty intuitive just to reach up and click them

01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:26.060
Now granted, there are certain things that are horrible in Unity for a new user experience

01:16:26.060 --> 01:16:29.060
For example, it hides all the menus by default

01:16:29.060 --> 01:16:33.060
I think by default, GNOME is a little hard for app discovery

01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:35.060
Although, remember when we sat Angela down?

01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:38.060
The first thing she did was went up to the corner and looked for applications

01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:39.060
Remember that?

01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:40.060
And we even asked her

01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:41.060
But she's also used GNOME, right?

01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:42.060
No

01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:43.060
Oh, really?

01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:45.060
Well, I mean, she's used it here, but I have the dock

01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:48.060
I mean, she's never used that menu before that I know of

01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:53.060
And so I just thought it was, to her, it seemed kind of intuitive to go up in the corner and launch an application

01:16:53.060 --> 01:16:57.060
But I agree, I think for normal users, I take that dash to dock extension

01:16:57.060 --> 01:16:59.060
And I set it to auto expand like the Unity byte

01:16:59.060 --> 01:17:01.060
And I think that just makes a lot of sense

01:17:01.060 --> 01:17:02.060
No, it totally does

01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:09.060
My question was, do you see GNOME as primarily a power user's desktop then?

01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:11.060
Maybe not power, maybe that's a wrong term

01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:14.060
Experienced users, not necessarily power users

01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:16.060
I think it's perfect for experienced users right now

01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:21.060
And I think if they could stabilize the extension stuff, I think it'd be a lot better for regular users

01:17:21.060 --> 01:17:25.060
Or I think the stuff they just keep adding to it, you won't require extensions

01:17:25.060 --> 01:17:29.060
So I'm pretty excited about it, to be honest with you

01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:33.060
Because I think they're going in a direction that is great for users like you and I

01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:37.060
That have been using Linux for a long time and are comfortable with GNOME tweak

01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:39.060
And we're comfortable with installing some extensions

01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:43.060
Ironically, those are some of the more hardcore things to do for a desktop that's supposed to be super simple

01:17:43.060 --> 01:17:46.060
But if you're comfortable with that stuff, which is pretty much everybody in our audience

01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:47.060
I think it's perfect for them

01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:50.060
And then if you can get somebody like, if you get one extension on there

01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:53.060
Basically like Angela's desktop, she could get by with just dash to dock

01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:55.060
And I think she'd be fine

01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:56.060
So I think for her it's fine

01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:58.060
Yeah, I guess if you don't know what to look for

01:17:58.060 --> 01:17:59.060
Or you don't know what you're missing

01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:01.060
Or you don't know what is available in GNOME

01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:04.060
If you don't know, you could have a Bitcoin ticker in your menu bar

01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:05.060
Or a ping indicator

01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:06.060
You don't care when they go away

01:18:06.060 --> 01:18:07.060
Yeah, 14.2 milliseconds

01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:09.060
Yeah, oh really? Really?

01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:10.060
I'm at 11.3 milliseconds right now

01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:11.060
Yeah, I'm on wireless

01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:13.060
Oh, I get the wired advantage

01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:14.060
Hello, Ethan

01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:15.060
Wired advantage

01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:18.060
You know, Mr. Noah, we could go on about this for a long time

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:19.060
We could

01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:21.060
But I do want to just take a moment here

01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:23.060
And I want to talk about our next sponsor, and that's Ting

01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:27.060
And then, my friends, we have got to dig into this stuff going on in Fedora

01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:29.060
Actually, there's some really interesting things

01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:32.060
One in particular I forgot to mention in our Fedora review

01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:35.060
Major oversight, because it's totally changed the way I use my laptop

01:18:35.060 --> 01:18:37.060
So we've got to talk about that in our Fedora

01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:39.060
I know, can you believe I forgot that in the review?

01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:41.060
Well, it's the way you change your laptop

01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:43.060
Right before you decided that you couldn't deal with Fedora anymore

01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:45.060
And you have to go back to Arch right before the show

01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:47.060
That doesn't have to do with this thing, though

01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:49.060
Yeah, I'll talk more about that, too

01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:51.060
But first, let me tell you about

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:53.060
That's right, our buddies over at Ting

01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:56.060
Go to linux.ting.com, please, won't you?

01:18:56.060 --> 01:18:59.060
Not only do you get to put Linux in your URL bar

01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:02.060
But you get a $50 discount off your first Ting device

01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:03.060
$50

01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:04.060
Yeah

01:19:04.060 --> 01:19:05.060
$50

01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:06.060
That's a lot of money

01:19:06.060 --> 01:19:08.060
Dude, they have some devices that are nearly only $50

01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:09.060
It's almost the whole device

01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:11.060
And if you have a compatible device, you'll get a service credit

01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:13.060
Now, why Ting? My friends, I will tell you why

01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:15.060
Ting is mobile that truly makes sense

01:19:15.060 --> 01:19:16.060
Thank goodness

01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:17.060
Thank goodness

01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:18.060
Mobile that makes sense

01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:19.060
It's no contract

01:19:19.060 --> 01:19:20.060
You only pay for what you use

01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:22.060
$6 is all you pay for the line

01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:24.060
And then it's just your usage on top of that

01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:26.060
It's really straightforward and obvious, too

01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:27.060
There's no hidden secrets in there

01:19:27.060 --> 01:19:30.060
There's just, like, your usage and your taxes and the line

01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:31.060
And the devices are unlocked

01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:32.060
You own the device outright

01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:34.060
So that's super nice, isn't it?

01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:36.060
You can go over there and bring your own device

01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:37.060
If you have a GSM-compatible one

01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:40.060
Or they have so, so many nice ones to choose from now

01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:42.060
And one of the things I really enjoy about Ting

01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:46.060
Is I can fully manage it just using my own web browser

01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:47.060
I really never have to call Ting

01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:48.060
Even though I could

01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:50.060
Ironically, Ting is so well-structured for that

01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:52.060
If you call them at 1-855-TING-FTW

01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:55.060
Between 8am or 8pm, a real human being answers the phone

01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:58.060
Wrap your head around this, you guys

01:19:58.060 --> 01:20:00.060
It's mobile service with no contract

01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:01.060
No early termination fees

01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:03.060
You're only paying for your actual usage

01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:05.060
And they have no hold customer service

01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:09.060
Plus, they have a CDMA or GSM network you can choose from

01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:11.060
That's super powerful and a lot of flexibility

01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:15.060
For me, it's really nice just from a straight

01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:17.060
This probably sounds a little excessive

01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:20.060
But see, with Ting, it's very easy to have multiple lines

01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:22.060
Because I'm just paying the $6

01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:25.060
So Ting now has the Galaxy S6 Edge

01:20:25.060 --> 01:20:27.060
I think that's the best phone of the year right now

01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:29.060
Yeah, I think many would agree with you

01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:31.060
So I also still have my Nexus 5

01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:33.060
Which is also a very good phone

01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:35.060
The thing I love about the Nexus 5

01:20:35.060 --> 01:20:37.060
That the Edge, I don't know if it does

01:20:37.060 --> 01:20:41.060
Is that the Nexus 5 can be moved between GSM and CDMA

01:20:41.060 --> 01:20:43.060
So when we go to conferences and stuff

01:20:43.060 --> 01:20:44.060
I can look up the coverage map

01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:46.060
And see if it's stronger to have CDMA or GSM

01:20:46.060 --> 01:20:48.060
But on top of that, if I get there

01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:51.060
And I discover, oh man, the GSM network is blasted at this conference

01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:53.060
I can try switching over to the CDMA network

01:20:53.060 --> 01:20:55.060
I just got to swap the SIMs out and stuff

01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:56.060
Switch over to the CDMA network

01:20:56.060 --> 01:21:00.060
That is such a unique competitive advantage to Ting right now

01:21:00.060 --> 01:21:01.060
That blows my mind

01:21:01.060 --> 01:21:03.060
And you just pay for what you use

01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:04.060
Yeah, and the great thing about it is

01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:05.060
Because of their intuitive dashboard

01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:06.060
You can shut that phone off

01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:08.060
And it can sit in the studio here for six months

01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:09.060
You never touch it

01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:10.060
Then when you get there, you log in

01:21:10.060 --> 01:21:11.060
In fact, you can do it on your Ting app

01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:12.060
You can open it up

01:21:12.060 --> 01:21:14.060
From my app, that's what I do

01:21:14.060 --> 01:21:16.060
I just turn it on and off from my other phone

01:21:16.060 --> 01:21:17.060
It's really the way it should be

01:21:17.060 --> 01:21:19.060
So you said you thought that it was most of the cost of a phone

01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:24.060
You can actually get the Kurosera Dura XT for $47

01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:25.060
Now, at first glance, you might look at that and go

01:21:25.060 --> 01:21:27.060
Why would I want that old looking flip phone?

01:21:27.060 --> 01:21:28.060
Oh, I don't know

01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:30.060
You know how I got started on Ting?

01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:33.060
I was listening to the Linux action show

01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:35.060
And the only time I had to do that was at like three in the morning

01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:37.060
So my wife was next to me sleeping

01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:39.060
And all of a sudden, I get out of bed

01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:40.060
And I'm over at my computer

01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:42.060
And she goes, what are you doing?

01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:43.060
And I'm like, I got to check this out

01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:45.060
I think you can get a phone for like $10 a month

01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:47.060
And she's like, do we have to do that now?

01:21:47.060 --> 01:21:49.060
And I'm like, yeah, we have to do that now

01:21:49.060 --> 01:21:50.060
So I ordered something like this

01:21:50.060 --> 01:21:52.060
It was made by Samsung, but it's very similar

01:21:52.060 --> 01:21:53.060
It's just a little flip phone

01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:55.060
And that was how I got started on Ting

01:21:55.060 --> 01:21:58.060
And it was just my, what you were talking about, a Bat Phone

01:21:58.060 --> 01:21:59.060
So I gave Sarah the number

01:21:59.060 --> 01:22:01.060
And I'm like, here, you're the only one that has this number

01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:03.060
Anything really important happens, call me on this

01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:04.060
The battery will last a while

01:22:04.060 --> 01:22:05.060
And I'll just have this with me

01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:10.060
And then once I learned that I made sure that I could get coverage everywhere I wanted

01:22:10.060 --> 01:22:11.060
Then I switched over to Hog

01:22:11.060 --> 01:22:16.060
So this Kyocera Dura, right, this is a $47 feature phone

01:22:16.060 --> 01:22:18.060
It's super durable

01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:20.060
They joke here they can get hit by missiles

01:22:20.060 --> 01:22:22.060
And it still works

01:22:22.060 --> 01:22:23.060
What if they tested that?

01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:26.060
Well, it meets the military 801G standard

01:22:26.060 --> 01:22:29.060
Which means the phone can take dust, rain, radiation, salt, and humidity

01:22:29.060 --> 01:22:30.060
I don't see anything about missiles

01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:31.060
No, I don't either

01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:33.060
It has Bluetooth

01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:34.060
It also has a camera

01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:36.060
Now, it's not going to be a very good camera

01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:37.060
But you know what this made me think?

01:22:37.060 --> 01:22:40.060
If it's rugged, which means it's probably going to handle heat and stuff okay

01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:41.060
In my glove box

01:22:41.060 --> 01:22:43.060
It has a camera

01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:47.060
I could just have this thing plugged into my cigarette adapter for $6 a month

01:22:47.060 --> 01:22:50.060
When you get a $50 credit, the phone is freaking free

01:22:50.060 --> 01:22:52.060
And then it's just $6

01:22:52.060 --> 01:22:55.060
And I could have an emergency phone in my vehicle at all times

01:22:55.060 --> 01:22:56.060
That's really nice

01:22:56.060 --> 01:22:58.060
You could have an emergency phone in your vehicle

01:22:58.060 --> 01:23:00.060
Or I like to spend a lot of time at the lake in the summer

01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:02.060
It would be great to throw that in the backpack

01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:05.060
And just know that if I ever need a phone and it gets a little wet

01:23:05.060 --> 01:23:07.060
I don't have to baby it and stuff like that

01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:11.060
Or like I was just out at the lake recently

01:23:11.060 --> 01:23:16.060
And I was very, very aware that I just got the S6

01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:17.060
And it's out there at the lake

01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:21.060
And I'm like if I freaking ruin this phone out on the lake

01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:23.060
And it's just like even out in the sun and stuff it bakes

01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:25.060
So that would be the perfect day to take my day phone

01:23:25.060 --> 01:23:27.060
Now it sounds really crazy to take a different phone with you

01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:28.060
Depending on where you're going

01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:31.060
But it's so easy to move numbers around like with Google Voice and stuff

01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:33.060
And it's so cheap to do it at $6 a month

01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:36.060
And when you get the $50 service credit, this phone is free

01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:40.060
And the same thing, they have the MiFi adapters

01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:42.060
Actually, you know what I noticed?

01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:43.060
The phone is $47

01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:45.060
So actually, the phone is free

01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:49.060
And they're going to pay for half of the line charge for the first month or whatever

01:23:49.060 --> 01:23:52.060
They're going to pay the first $3 for the service

01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:53.060
I know

01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:54.060
It's nuts

01:23:54.060 --> 01:23:55.060
How can they afford to do that?

01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:57.060
That's what's so awesome about the MVNO structure

01:23:57.060 --> 01:24:00.060
They didn't have to dig the dirt and put all of those towers in

01:24:00.060 --> 01:24:03.060
So they didn't blow out a billion dollars doing that

01:24:03.060 --> 01:24:05.060
So they can focus on the customer service

01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:07.060
They can focus on the right devices

01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:10.060
They can focus on the awesome plans and making the deals possible

01:24:10.060 --> 01:24:12.060
They buy up all the spectrum from these guys at wholesale

01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:14.060
And they get a great price on that

01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:17.060
And when you remove that layer of having to constantly invest in the infrastructure

01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:19.060
And all the techs and pulling all the fiber and all that

01:24:19.060 --> 01:24:22.060
When you remove all of that, you can focus on really the customer experience

01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:24.060
And that's Ting's secret weapon

01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:27.060
And that's why they're always going to be more competitive than the other guys

01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:30.060
So go to linux.ting.com

01:24:30.060 --> 01:24:34.060
And thanks to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program

01:24:34.060 --> 01:24:36.060
Alright, so Fedora 22 came out

01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:39.060
The last couple Fedora releases we've gotten a lot of coverage

01:24:39.060 --> 01:24:42.060
We've gone from really not talking about Fedora very much

01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:44.060
To now we talk about Fedora a lot

01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:45.060
And I feel like

01:24:45.060 --> 01:24:47.060
Linux action shows are definitely improving

01:24:49.060 --> 01:24:52.060
Noah takes no credit for himself there of course

01:24:52.060 --> 01:24:53.060
I wasn't there for the other two reviews

01:24:53.060 --> 01:24:55.060
I'm just saying the quality of the show is improving

01:24:55.060 --> 01:24:57.060
Because you're talking about Fedora

01:24:58.060 --> 01:25:00.060
It's for people who like to mess with computers

01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:01.060
That is true actually

01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:02.060
I would agree with that

01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:05.060
Fedora is for people that like to mess with computers

01:25:05.060 --> 01:25:07.060
I actually agree with Leo Laporte on something

01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:08.060
That's amazing

01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:12.060
So we did mention that Fedora 22 marks the demise of YUM

01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:15.060
And the introduction of DNF

01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:17.060
And does anybody in the Mumble remember with DNF?

01:25:17.060 --> 01:25:18.060
Yeah exactly

01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:20.060
The quality of Fedora increased as well

01:25:21.060 --> 01:25:22.060
What does DNF stand for?

01:25:22.060 --> 01:25:23.060
Do you remember?

01:25:23.060 --> 01:25:25.060
Does not stand for anything maybe

01:25:26.060 --> 01:25:28.060
But here's the one thing that was the miss in our review

01:25:28.060 --> 01:25:30.060
That I wanted to follow up on right now

01:25:30.060 --> 01:25:31.060
And I also wanted to kind of mention it

01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:33.060
Because it's one of the semi-controversial things

01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:35.060
About the new release of Fedora

01:25:35.060 --> 01:25:37.060
It's not the use of Wayland for GDM

01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:39.060
But it's the new lib input

01:25:39.060 --> 01:25:42.060
That changes the way trackpads are handled

01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:44.060
And for my Synaptics trackpads

01:25:44.060 --> 01:25:47.060
I have noticed a huge improvement in accuracy

01:25:47.060 --> 01:25:50.060
Right now I'm using it to scroll this page

01:25:50.060 --> 01:25:53.060
I can't quite describe what it is that feels different about it

01:25:53.060 --> 01:25:55.060
But it feels very good

01:25:55.060 --> 01:25:56.060
Like this scroll

01:25:56.060 --> 01:25:57.060
It's right on the mouse

01:25:57.060 --> 01:25:58.060
It's right on it

01:25:58.060 --> 01:26:00.060
And do you notice the difference too with the mouse input?

01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:01.060
Not on this piece of crap

01:26:01.060 --> 01:26:04.060
But on my System76

01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:06.060
Or on my

01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:08.060
I have the

01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:10.060
Not a Dell

01:26:10.060 --> 01:26:11.060
Lenovo

01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:12.060
That's what it is

01:26:12.060 --> 01:26:13.060
My wife's Lenovo

01:26:13.060 --> 01:26:14.060
I was testing it on there

01:26:14.060 --> 01:26:16.060
And on those with smoother trackpads

01:26:16.060 --> 01:26:17.060
It works

01:26:17.060 --> 01:26:18.060
It was very responsive

01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:20.060
And I think you made the

01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:21.060
You said this

01:26:21.060 --> 01:26:22.060
I think Linux Unplugged

01:26:22.060 --> 01:26:23.060
Maybe it was last week

01:26:23.060 --> 01:26:25.060
And it struck a chord with me

01:26:25.060 --> 01:26:27.060
It feels like the cursor is glued to your finger

01:26:27.060 --> 01:26:28.060
Yes

01:26:28.060 --> 01:26:29.060
It's attached to your finger

01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:30.060
Exactly

01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:31.060
It's right there

01:26:31.060 --> 01:26:32.060
They've really nailed it

01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:34.060
It feels like a level of mouse responsiveness

01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:35.060
I've never seen in X before

01:26:35.060 --> 01:26:37.060
I thought maybe that just wasn't capable in X11

01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:40.060
And I was going, okay, I've got to wait for Wayland, I guess

01:26:40.060 --> 01:26:41.060
I hope they fix it then

01:26:41.060 --> 01:26:43.060
But LibInput's real nice

01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:46.060
So DNF, by the way, stands for Danified Yum

01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:47.060
Yeah, yeah, yeah

01:26:47.060 --> 01:26:48.060
Dandyified, right?

01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:49.060
Dandyified Yum

01:26:49.060 --> 01:26:50.060
Dandyified Yum

01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:51.060
Dandyified

01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:53.060
It's amazing how they come up with these names

01:26:53.060 --> 01:26:54.060
It's something

01:26:54.060 --> 01:26:55.060
Here's what's funny

01:26:55.060 --> 01:26:56.060
Here's what's funny

01:26:56.060 --> 01:27:00.060
That is going to be in some sort of corporate brief at some point

01:27:00.060 --> 01:27:04.060
The selling points of RHEL 9, RHEL 10 is going to update

01:27:04.060 --> 01:27:05.060
An update package manager

01:27:05.060 --> 01:27:06.060
You're right

01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:08.060
And they're going to be using the Dandyified Yum

01:27:08.060 --> 01:27:10.060
Like some guy in a business suit is going to sit there

01:27:10.060 --> 01:27:11.060
And have to listen

01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:12.060
It's just kind of funny to me

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:13.060
It is

01:27:13.060 --> 01:27:14.060
I never thought about it from the RHEL perspective

01:27:14.060 --> 01:27:15.060
Yeah

01:27:15.060 --> 01:27:17.060
Anybody in the Mumba Room want to share their perspectives

01:27:17.060 --> 01:27:20.060
On Fedora 22 before I kind of get into what's coming up

01:27:20.060 --> 01:27:23.060
For Fedora 23?

01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:25.060
Nobody has used Fedora 22

01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:26.060
You're all missing out

01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:27.060
Do you know what you're missing?

01:27:27.060 --> 01:27:29.060
I've used every Fedora release since one

01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:30.060
That's a great release

01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:31.060
And nobody has tried Fedora 22

01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:33.060
This might be the best release of Fedora yet

01:27:33.060 --> 01:27:34.060
Yeah

01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:35.060
With a couple of exceptions

01:27:35.060 --> 01:27:38.060
I've had some weird problems with Chrome under Fedora 22

01:27:38.060 --> 01:27:40.060
A couple of my extensions did not install

01:27:40.060 --> 01:27:41.060
Yeah

01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:42.060
Which has never happened to me before

01:27:42.060 --> 01:27:44.060
And Flash video plays

01:27:44.060 --> 01:27:46.060
The Chrome tab shows the audio is playing

01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:48.060
But I don't actually get any sound out from Chrome

01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:49.060
That's an Adobe problem

01:27:49.060 --> 01:27:50.060
It's a Flash

01:27:50.060 --> 01:27:51.060
I know, but I've never had that problem before

01:27:51.060 --> 01:27:52.060
I'm just kidding

01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:53.060
I don't even know if it is

01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:54.060
Is it even Flash?

01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:55.060
Isn't it rendering in HTML5?

01:27:55.060 --> 01:27:56.060
Did we talk about this?

01:27:56.060 --> 01:27:57.060
Oh, that's right

01:27:57.060 --> 01:27:58.060
I don't think it's

01:27:58.060 --> 01:27:59.060
That's right

01:27:59.060 --> 01:28:00.060
We tried HTML5 video and it doesn't work either

01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:01.060
It's just any sound in Chrome

01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:02.060
Yeah

01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:03.060
And Firefox doesn't have that problem

01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:04.060
Yeah

01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:05.060
So that's

01:28:05.060 --> 01:28:06.060
I've had those issues

01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:08.060
But for the most part it has been pretty good for me

01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:10.060
Chrome is sort of a sticky point

01:28:10.060 --> 01:28:12.060
I'd like to get the audience's response

01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:15.060
Obviously our virtual lug has not been too excited about Fedora 22

01:28:15.060 --> 01:28:16.060
Yeah, well I guess

01:28:16.060 --> 01:28:17.060
So here's the thing too

01:28:17.060 --> 01:28:19.060
Fedora is not for everyone

01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:21.060
And Red Hat acknowledges that Fedora is not for everyone

01:28:21.060 --> 01:28:23.060
And I am a diehard lover of Fedora

01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:25.060
I acknowledge that Fedora isn't for everyone

01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:27.060
Fedora is a great release if you

01:28:27.060 --> 01:28:28.060
For one, for a long time

01:28:28.060 --> 01:28:30.060
If you wanted to use Gnome

01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:31.060
It was a great release to have

01:28:31.060 --> 01:28:34.060
Because if you don't want to take the time to put Arch together

01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:37.060
Because maybe I just want to install my operating system

01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:41.060
And I'd like to have things like a software manager and stuff like that

01:28:41.060 --> 01:28:44.060
I think that Fedora fits the bill pretty well

01:28:44.060 --> 01:28:48.060
And then like I said, I think the real sweet spot is

01:28:48.060 --> 01:28:49.060
If you're a system administrator

01:28:49.060 --> 01:28:52.060
And you want something that you can try out the newest versions of something

01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:57.060
Before it actually goes into stable production

01:28:57.060 --> 01:28:59.060
I wonder too

01:28:59.060 --> 01:29:00.060
Maybe not many

01:29:00.060 --> 01:29:02.060
I wonder how many people are waiting for Korora 22

01:29:02.060 --> 01:29:05.060
The re-spin of Fedora that includes all the codecs

01:29:05.060 --> 01:29:06.060
And makes it much easier for end users

01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:07.060
So I want to clarify this

01:29:07.060 --> 01:29:11.060
So somebody says they want to bring up the comparison to Antragos

01:29:11.060 --> 01:29:13.060
Antragos is a great installer

01:29:13.060 --> 01:29:15.060
It's a great distro

01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:17.060
And I think it does do a very good job of just

01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:19.060
You plug the USB key and then I have Linux

01:29:19.060 --> 01:29:24.060
However, first of all, there are tiny little issues that do come up with Antragos

01:29:24.060 --> 01:29:26.060
Like its installer can be broken from time to time?

01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:28.060
Like the installer doesn't recognize the internet

01:29:28.060 --> 01:29:29.060
That seems to be an issue

01:29:29.060 --> 01:29:30.060
But the other thing too is

01:29:30.060 --> 01:29:35.060
Antragos still is a very customized

01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:37.060
It's very customized and it's very minute

01:29:37.060 --> 01:29:38.060
So okay, alright

01:29:38.060 --> 01:29:40.060
Give me like one example

01:29:40.060 --> 01:29:42.060
Alright, so when you plug the USB drive in

01:29:42.060 --> 01:29:44.060
You have to choose if you want to

01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:46.060
You have to choose which desktop

01:29:46.060 --> 01:29:47.060
Sorry

01:29:47.060 --> 01:29:49.060
You put the CD in, Chris

01:29:49.060 --> 01:29:51.060
No, I just like that you're

01:29:51.060 --> 01:29:55.060
Like how the desktop environment handles the USB storage medium

01:29:55.060 --> 01:29:57.060
Is like a major issue for you

01:29:57.060 --> 01:29:59.060
It's like a deal breaker

01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:01.060
I was talking about installing it

01:30:01.060 --> 01:30:03.060
But you have to choose the desktop environment, right?

01:30:03.060 --> 01:30:06.060
And so for somebody that plays a lot of Linux distros

01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:07.060
That's super nice

01:30:07.060 --> 01:30:09.060
And I think that's an awesome

01:30:09.060 --> 01:30:11.060
Sorry, go ahead

01:30:11.060 --> 01:30:13.060
I was saying you get to choose a desktop environment

01:30:13.060 --> 01:30:14.060
Yeah, that's true

01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:15.060
You get to

01:30:15.060 --> 01:30:16.060
But kind of the nice thing about Fedora

01:30:16.060 --> 01:30:17.060
Is when I plug it in

01:30:17.060 --> 01:30:19.060
I can just install it

01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:21.060
Some of those things are gone

01:30:21.060 --> 01:30:22.060
And in some respects it's kind of nice

01:30:22.060 --> 01:30:24.060
Because it's kind of a mix between

01:30:24.060 --> 01:30:26.060
This really bleeding edge

01:30:26.060 --> 01:30:27.060
And not just having to custom

01:30:27.060 --> 01:30:28.060
A curated thing

01:30:28.060 --> 01:30:29.060
Pick every single thing

01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:30.060
I have a mail client

01:30:30.060 --> 01:30:31.060
I have a web browser

01:30:31.060 --> 01:30:33.060
So have you tried Korora?

01:30:33.060 --> 01:30:34.060
No

01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:35.060
Well yeah, a while ago

01:30:35.060 --> 01:30:36.060
I haven't tried it with obviously

01:30:36.060 --> 01:30:38.060
They don't have Korra 22 out yet

01:30:38.060 --> 01:30:40.060
And I think like people in our Mumble Room

01:30:40.060 --> 01:30:41.060
If you've been kind of

01:30:41.060 --> 01:30:42.060
Or in our audience

01:30:42.060 --> 01:30:45.060
If you've kind of been borderline curious about Fedora

01:30:45.060 --> 01:30:46.060
But you're worried about it

01:30:46.060 --> 01:30:48.060
Maybe not working for you

01:30:48.060 --> 01:30:49.060
You could just try straight up Fedora

01:30:49.060 --> 01:30:50.060
It's pretty great

01:30:50.060 --> 01:30:51.060
Yeah

01:30:51.060 --> 01:30:53.060
Korora 22 when it hits though

01:30:53.060 --> 01:30:54.060
You know like

01:30:54.060 --> 01:30:56.060
One of the things I really like about it

01:30:56.060 --> 01:30:57.060
Is it just

01:30:57.060 --> 01:30:58.060
It comes loaded again

01:30:58.060 --> 01:30:59.060
I know this is always my go to

01:30:59.060 --> 01:31:00.060
But it just comes loaded with a ton of stuff that I like

01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:01.060
So you get to choose from

01:31:01.060 --> 01:31:03.060
Cinnamon, GNOME, KDE, MATER, XFCE

01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:05.060
It's got Adobe Flash already installed

01:31:05.060 --> 01:31:07.060
Dropbox, Google Chrome is loaded

01:31:07.060 --> 01:31:08.060
With the Google Talk plugin

01:31:08.060 --> 01:31:10.060
RPM, Fusion repos are already set up

01:31:10.060 --> 01:31:12.060
VirtualBox is already

01:31:12.060 --> 01:31:13.060
Is ready to go

01:31:13.060 --> 01:31:15.060
Third party driver support is set up

01:31:15.060 --> 01:31:16.060
And ready to go

01:31:16.060 --> 01:31:17.060
Like for Nvidia graphics cards

01:31:17.060 --> 01:31:20.060
Steam is no problem to get going

01:31:20.060 --> 01:31:21.060
Like it just

01:31:21.060 --> 01:31:23.060
It just takes all of the stuff that

01:31:23.060 --> 01:31:25.060
You might want

01:31:25.060 --> 01:31:27.060
And makes it ready to go

01:31:27.060 --> 01:31:30.060
So I guess where I get kind of disappointed with that is

01:31:30.060 --> 01:31:32.060
I guess it makes me disappointed

01:31:32.060 --> 01:31:34.060
That we have to have

01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:35.060
Essentially a fork of Fedora

01:31:35.060 --> 01:31:36.060
To get those things

01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:37.060
It's a respin

01:31:37.060 --> 01:31:39.060
They're using the respin tools I think in Fedora

01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:41.060
I would like to get that respin

01:31:41.060 --> 01:31:44.060
If your opinion is reflected

01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:46.060
On a large user base

01:31:46.060 --> 01:31:47.060
And I think it is

01:31:47.060 --> 01:31:48.060
I think it would be

01:31:48.060 --> 01:31:50.060
It would be nice to see those changes implemented

01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:51.060
You know they won't

01:31:51.060 --> 01:31:52.060
Because of the legal issues

01:31:52.060 --> 01:31:53.060
Right

01:31:53.060 --> 01:31:55.060
So this is taking care of a problem

01:31:55.060 --> 01:31:56.060
That Red Hat can't legally do

01:31:56.060 --> 01:31:59.060
If Red Hat wanted to make the most amazing desktop

01:31:59.060 --> 01:32:00.060
Ever

01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:01.060
They couldn't

01:32:01.060 --> 01:32:02.060
Because of the legality

01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:03.060
So you know what

01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:04.060
These guys take care of it for them

01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:05.060
And the thing is

01:32:05.060 --> 01:32:07.060
It follows pretty closely to Fedora

01:32:07.060 --> 01:32:08.060
And if you want to use regular Fedora you can

01:32:08.060 --> 01:32:10.060
I just think Karora is a great option

01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:13.060
Fedora 23 is going to have a new way to upgrade

01:32:13.060 --> 01:32:17.060
So FedUp has been around since Fedora 17

01:32:17.060 --> 01:32:18.060
Have you ever used FedUp?

01:32:18.060 --> 01:32:19.060
Yes

01:32:19.060 --> 01:32:20.060
Yes I have

01:32:20.060 --> 01:32:21.060
FedUp is getting rewritten

01:32:21.060 --> 01:32:22.060
To be totally honest

01:32:22.060 --> 01:32:24.060
I would not recommend upgrading Fedora

01:32:24.060 --> 01:32:26.060
I've done it

01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:27.060
I've done it a couple times

01:32:27.060 --> 01:32:29.060
But I've run into issues far more times

01:32:29.060 --> 01:32:31.060
Like probably

01:32:31.060 --> 01:32:33.060
It's probably not an exaggeration to say

01:32:33.060 --> 01:32:34.060
Probably one out of every three times

01:32:34.060 --> 01:32:36.060
Something bad happens

01:32:36.060 --> 01:32:39.060
Between 15 and 16 was particularly horrible

01:32:39.060 --> 01:32:41.060
Because what would happen is

01:32:41.060 --> 01:32:42.060
You would upgrade the system

01:32:42.060 --> 01:32:44.060
And it would just do this thing

01:32:44.060 --> 01:32:45.060
Where you would load

01:32:45.060 --> 01:32:47.060
It would load the log in manager

01:32:47.060 --> 01:32:48.060
And you would type in your password

01:32:48.060 --> 01:32:49.060
And then it would just go right back to you

01:32:49.060 --> 01:32:50.060
Asking for the password again

01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:52.060
And I could not find a way to fix it

01:32:52.060 --> 01:32:53.060
How annoying

01:32:53.060 --> 01:32:55.060
Well it's annoying when it's on your laptop

01:32:55.060 --> 01:32:57.060
And all of your work is there

01:32:57.060 --> 01:32:58.060
And I can't log in

01:32:58.060 --> 01:33:00.060
And I'm sitting in front of somebody

01:33:00.060 --> 01:33:01.060
And they're going why can't you log in

01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:02.060
Then I have to explain that

01:33:02.060 --> 01:33:03.060
I don't know why I can't log in

01:33:03.060 --> 01:33:04.060
And not only can I not log in

01:33:04.060 --> 01:33:06.060
But I can't even log in to find out why I can't log in

01:33:06.060 --> 01:33:08.060
So here's what they're doing

01:33:08.060 --> 01:33:09.060
Here's what they're doing to FedUp

01:33:09.060 --> 01:33:11.060
They say they've come to the conclusion

01:33:11.060 --> 01:33:13.060
That the current design is unsupportable

01:33:13.060 --> 01:33:14.060
Mostly due to upgrade.image

01:33:14.060 --> 01:33:16.060
Which turns out to cause more problems than it solves

01:33:16.060 --> 01:33:18.060
So for Fedora 23

01:33:18.060 --> 01:33:20.060
FedUp needs to be redesigned

01:33:20.060 --> 01:33:23.060
They're going to download packages for the new system

01:33:23.060 --> 01:33:26.060
And then they're going to use SystemD

01:33:26.060 --> 01:33:29.060
And it's offline updates facility

01:33:29.060 --> 01:33:30.060
To install the packages

01:33:30.060 --> 01:33:31.060
This is really simple

01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:33.060
They say it's going to be a simple enough approach

01:33:33.060 --> 01:33:35.060
That probably will be provided by the system packaging tools

01:33:35.060 --> 01:33:37.060
They have a proof of concept already up on GitHub

01:33:37.060 --> 01:33:40.060
Integrated in as a DNF plugin

01:33:40.060 --> 01:33:42.060
As a DNF plugin

01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:43.060
A dandy-ified yum plugin?

01:33:43.060 --> 01:33:44.060
Yep

01:33:44.060 --> 01:33:46.060
This behavior could be implemented by package kit

01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:49.060
Which would make it easy to write a gooey wrapper for it

01:33:49.060 --> 01:33:51.060
So the plan is to drop upgrade.image

01:33:51.060 --> 01:33:53.060
Move to upgrade support into the system packaging tools

01:33:53.060 --> 01:33:55.060
And make it a simpler system

01:33:55.060 --> 01:33:58.060
So use the SystemD offline update functionality

01:33:58.060 --> 01:34:00.060
Bob is indeed your uncle

01:34:00.060 --> 01:34:01.060
What do you think of that?

01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:03.060
Look at SystemD being an essential tool to do the updates

01:34:03.060 --> 01:34:07.060
Do you think that this is another sign

01:34:07.060 --> 01:34:11.060
That the Red Hat group is trying to move

01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:14.060
Is trying to repurpose and restructure

01:34:14.060 --> 01:34:18.060
Fedora to be more streamlined for the workforce?

01:34:18.060 --> 01:34:22.060
Rather than just being a testing bed for Red Hat?

01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:25.060
That's a, yeah, why do they care?

01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:26.060
Yeah, why do they care about being

01:34:26.060 --> 01:34:29.060
I mean, blowing away a desktop isn't that big of a deal

01:34:29.060 --> 01:34:30.060
I mean, especially if you're using Fedora

01:34:30.060 --> 01:34:31.060
Especially if it's for enthusiasts

01:34:31.060 --> 01:34:32.060
Yeah, right

01:34:32.060 --> 01:34:35.060
So it almost, and you know, look at the wording

01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:36.060
They've changed it to Fedora

01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:38.060
Now they call it Fedora Workstation

01:34:38.060 --> 01:34:40.060
That alone is interesting

01:34:40.060 --> 01:34:42.060
The only thing that is missing for me to go

01:34:42.060 --> 01:34:44.060
Every client I work for and say

01:34:44.060 --> 01:34:45.060
We're done with using this, that or the other

01:34:45.060 --> 01:34:47.060
We're going to switch to Fedora

01:34:47.060 --> 01:34:48.060
I have to have an LTS

01:34:48.060 --> 01:34:49.060
I have to have

01:34:49.060 --> 01:34:51.060
I have to have some sort of a locked thing

01:34:51.060 --> 01:34:53.060
That's there for three or four or five versions

01:34:53.060 --> 01:34:56.060
That is centered around a desktop operating system

01:34:56.060 --> 01:34:57.060
And 18 months just isn't enough

01:34:57.060 --> 01:34:58.060
No, it's not

01:34:58.060 --> 01:34:59.060
And then the other thing that would be nice

01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:00.060
I can live without it, but it would be nice

01:35:00.060 --> 01:35:02.060
Is if they could offer support

01:35:02.060 --> 01:35:05.060
So I could say, pay $800, $900 per workstation

01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:08.060
And you can call this company anytime and they'll help

01:35:08.060 --> 01:35:10.060
There are clients that would demand that

01:35:10.060 --> 01:35:13.060
So if that would be, that would be nice

01:35:13.060 --> 01:35:14.060
But I can live without that

01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:15.060
We can do the support

01:35:15.060 --> 01:35:16.060
So that's not the end of the world

01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:17.060
I mean, that is how I make money, right?

01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:18.060
I guess

01:35:18.060 --> 01:35:20.060
You could turn away as a money maker, I suppose

01:35:20.060 --> 01:35:22.060
But I'm still not convinced it's going to be a workable solution

01:35:22.060 --> 01:35:24.060
Because the problem, honestly, is

01:35:24.060 --> 01:35:25.060
Fedora releases

01:35:25.060 --> 01:35:28.060
And I think 22 is an example of this

01:35:28.060 --> 01:35:30.060
In my opinion, take a month before they're good

01:35:30.060 --> 01:35:32.060
I think it takes a month of updates

01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:35.060
A month before RPM fusion is all cut up to date for everything I need

01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:37.060
A month before everything in copper is where I'm at

01:35:37.060 --> 01:35:39.060
And so what you really get is

01:35:39.060 --> 01:35:42.060
So if you're going to turn this around to a client solution

01:35:42.060 --> 01:35:45.060
So you're going to wait a month before you deploy it to your clients

01:35:45.060 --> 01:35:47.060
But I'd wait a month before I deploy the next LTS

01:35:47.060 --> 01:35:49.060
Of course you would, of course you would

01:35:49.060 --> 01:35:51.060
But for Fedora, you're going to wait a month

01:35:51.060 --> 01:35:52.060
Then you're going to schedule it

01:35:52.060 --> 01:35:55.060
So it's going to be two to three months before you actually get it installed

01:35:55.060 --> 01:35:56.060
And then what do you really have?

01:35:56.060 --> 01:35:58.060
You have a 15, 14, 16 month support window

01:35:58.060 --> 01:36:00.060
Oh, as it is, yeah, it's not usable

01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:02.060
Even if the day it came out

01:36:02.060 --> 01:36:04.060
I could get it installed, I still wouldn't do it

01:36:04.060 --> 01:36:06.060
I don't have the time of day, the effort

01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:09.060
And I'm not going to tell my clients they have to pay me

01:36:09.060 --> 01:36:11.060
You know why we use Linux to begin with?

01:36:11.060 --> 01:36:13.060
Because I can set it up one time

01:36:13.060 --> 01:36:15.060
And then I can make my money actually doing useful things

01:36:15.060 --> 01:36:17.060
And the customer sees value

01:36:17.060 --> 01:36:19.060
Because they're not paying me to redo things constantly

01:36:19.060 --> 01:36:21.060
If I tell them that

01:36:21.060 --> 01:36:23.060
Because you can't wait the actual

01:36:23.060 --> 01:36:24.060
The full release

01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:26.060
I would probably up it by one

01:36:26.060 --> 01:36:28.060
So if the release cycle is, let's say

01:36:28.060 --> 01:36:29.060
They release every six months

01:36:29.060 --> 01:36:31.060
And then the support cycle is 12 months

01:36:31.060 --> 01:36:33.060
I would be replacing every six months

01:36:33.060 --> 01:36:35.060
Or this is 15, 16?

01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:38.060
Yeah, so I'm going to replace the cycle before that

01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:41.060
Because I want to give myself a little buffer time

01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:43.060
So even if I could do it the day it came out

01:36:43.060 --> 01:36:44.060
It wouldn't be practical

01:36:44.060 --> 01:36:47.060
Yeah, if they really want Workstation

01:36:47.060 --> 01:36:49.060
And it seems to me it would be so good

01:36:49.060 --> 01:36:50.060
For so many of their initiatives

01:36:50.060 --> 01:36:52.060
If more people were using Fedora Workstation

01:36:52.060 --> 01:36:54.060
The more people that are using Fedora Workstation

01:36:54.060 --> 01:36:55.060
Are going to be writing software for Fedora Cloud

01:36:55.060 --> 01:36:57.060
The more people that are deploying Fedora Cloud

01:36:57.060 --> 01:36:59.060
The more people that are going to use Red Hat Enterprise

01:36:59.060 --> 01:37:00.060
When they step up to the next level

01:37:00.060 --> 01:37:01.060
The more people that are buying Red Hat Enterprise

01:37:01.060 --> 01:37:03.060
Are buying huge fatty support contracts

01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:04.060
That milks the cow

01:37:04.060 --> 01:37:06.060
So it seems to me

01:37:06.060 --> 01:37:08.060
I know at first pass

01:37:08.060 --> 01:37:10.060
You can't quite see how Fedora

01:37:10.060 --> 01:37:11.060
How doubling down on Fedora

01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:13.060
And making it a long-term supportable product

01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:14.060
Makes them money

01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:15.060
But to me it seems pretty clear

01:37:15.060 --> 01:37:17.060
You can put it on a lot of desktops

01:37:17.060 --> 01:37:19.060
And plus they're just going to have to compete

01:37:19.060 --> 01:37:21.060
With other distros anyways if they don't do it

01:37:21.060 --> 01:37:23.060
And the model has been here for a long time

01:37:23.060 --> 01:37:24.060
To do stuff like this

01:37:24.060 --> 01:37:25.060
So for example, how many times

01:37:25.060 --> 01:37:28.060
Do you have a program that you have the choice

01:37:28.060 --> 01:37:29.060
Between the unstable and the stable?

01:37:29.060 --> 01:37:30.060
Why can't we do that?

01:37:30.060 --> 01:37:31.060
Why can't we have Fedora Workstation

01:37:31.060 --> 01:37:32.060
And Fedora Bleed?

01:37:32.060 --> 01:37:34.060
And Fedora Bleed is the

01:37:34.060 --> 01:37:36.060
Every time a mouse moves

01:37:36.060 --> 01:37:37.060
Yeah, right, exactly

01:37:37.060 --> 01:37:38.060
Every time something moves

01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:40.060
We put something in there

01:37:40.060 --> 01:37:41.060
We see if it works

01:37:41.060 --> 01:37:42.060
And then when it crashes and burns

01:37:42.060 --> 01:37:43.060
Oh well, at least we have

01:37:43.060 --> 01:37:45.060
Fedora Workstation

01:37:45.060 --> 01:37:47.060
And then Fedora Workstation

01:37:47.060 --> 01:37:48.060
You take the best of that

01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:49.060
And turn that into RHEL

01:37:49.060 --> 01:37:50.060
And that becomes a server

01:37:50.060 --> 01:37:51.060
That's essentially what they do

01:37:51.060 --> 01:37:52.060
But without the support though

01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:54.060
Yeah, well kind of

01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:55.060
Except not really

01:37:55.060 --> 01:37:57.060
Because I still see a lot of

01:37:57.060 --> 01:37:59.060
Really, DNF should not be

01:37:59.060 --> 01:38:01.060
Well, actually it has worked really well

01:38:01.060 --> 01:38:02.060
So I guess I can't say that yet

01:38:02.060 --> 01:38:05.060
But I feel like there should have been more

01:38:05.060 --> 01:38:06.060
I should have had more of a chance

01:38:06.060 --> 01:38:08.060
To play with DNF before

01:38:08.060 --> 01:38:09.060
It was in 21

01:38:09.060 --> 01:38:10.060
Yeah, I guess

01:38:10.060 --> 01:38:11.060
But it was a transition

01:38:11.060 --> 01:38:15.060
Actually, DNF was instituted in 18

01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:16.060
Oh really?

01:38:16.060 --> 01:38:18.060
I started playing with it in 21

01:38:18.060 --> 01:38:19.060
Yeah, okay

01:38:19.060 --> 01:38:21.060
Yeah, I wanted to give

01:38:21.060 --> 01:38:22.060
While we're talking about DNF

01:38:22.060 --> 01:38:24.060
I wanted to give Heaven's Revenge a chance

01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:25.060
To geek out

01:38:25.060 --> 01:38:26.060
I know you and Rotten were looking at

01:38:26.060 --> 01:38:27.060
Go ahead, Heavens

01:38:27.060 --> 01:38:32.060
Alright, DNF is an acronym for

01:38:32.060 --> 01:38:34.060
A SAT Solver Algorithm

01:38:34.060 --> 01:38:36.060
As in a Satisfiability Solver

01:38:36.060 --> 01:38:39.060
It started up in YUM on OpenSUSE

01:38:39.060 --> 01:38:41.060
To do their dependency management

01:38:41.060 --> 01:38:43.060
For package dependencies

01:38:43.060 --> 01:38:44.060
Yeah

01:38:44.060 --> 01:38:48.060
So DNF means Disjunctive Normal Form

01:38:48.060 --> 01:38:50.060
It's just the acronym of what the

01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:53.060
Class Combining Algorithm is

01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:55.060
For how they do the SAT solving

01:38:55.060 --> 01:38:56.060
That's geeky

01:38:56.060 --> 01:38:57.060
Thank you, sir

01:38:57.060 --> 01:38:58.060
Thank you

01:38:58.060 --> 01:38:59.060
That's a good way to end the Fedora discussion

01:38:59.060 --> 01:39:00.060
Right there

01:39:00.060 --> 01:39:02.060
I think, you know

01:39:02.060 --> 01:39:04.060
I invited Matthew Miller, the Fedora Project Lead

01:39:04.060 --> 01:39:05.060
On the show today

01:39:05.060 --> 01:39:07.060
But then we moved the show today

01:39:07.060 --> 01:39:08.060
Sorry, Matthew, if you were going to make it

01:39:08.060 --> 01:39:10.060
I'm fascinated to see where they're going

01:39:10.060 --> 01:39:12.060
Fascinated to see what Fedora 23 has in store

01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:14.060
And see what they do with the workstation spin

01:39:14.060 --> 01:39:16.060
I have a lot of interest in that

01:39:16.060 --> 01:39:17.060
I think that's going to be a big deal

01:39:17.060 --> 01:39:19.060
Just a couple of bits of business

01:39:19.060 --> 01:39:20.060
We'll be back at our regular time slot

01:39:20.060 --> 01:39:22.060
On Tuesday next week

01:39:22.060 --> 01:39:23.060
2 p.m. Pacific

01:39:23.060 --> 01:39:24.060
You can go to jupiterbroadcasting.com

01:39:24.060 --> 01:39:25.060
Slash calendar

01:39:25.060 --> 01:39:27.060
To get that all up in your business

01:39:27.060 --> 01:39:29.060
We're also attempting to raise some more funds

01:39:29.060 --> 01:39:30.060
For the network

01:39:30.060 --> 01:39:31.060
Post Linux Fest and events

01:39:31.060 --> 01:39:33.060
We are hoping to get some more support

01:39:33.060 --> 01:39:34.060
On our Patreon page

01:39:34.060 --> 01:39:36.060
Over at patreon.com slash today

01:39:36.060 --> 01:39:38.060
We'll have some interesting developments

01:39:38.060 --> 01:39:39.060
Coming there soon

01:39:39.060 --> 01:39:40.060
And when you go over there

01:39:40.060 --> 01:39:42.060
There is a video that Noah and I posted

01:39:42.060 --> 01:39:44.060
In fact, if I go to the post real quick

01:39:44.060 --> 01:39:46.060
I can go pull this up

01:39:46.060 --> 01:39:47.060
Noah, do you remember we did this?

01:39:47.060 --> 01:39:48.060
I posted this from my phone

01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:49.060
Yeah

01:39:49.060 --> 01:39:50.060
A May studio update

01:39:50.060 --> 01:39:52.060
Posted for our patrons

01:39:52.060 --> 01:39:53.060
Look at your face right there

01:39:53.060 --> 01:39:55.060
It looks like I'm calling you out on something

01:39:55.060 --> 01:39:56.060
Yeah, I think you were

01:39:56.060 --> 01:39:58.060
Yeah, so there I am

01:39:58.060 --> 01:39:59.060
Rocking my HTML5 shirt

01:39:59.060 --> 01:40:01.060
And Noah and I are doing an in-studio build

01:40:01.060 --> 01:40:03.060
Where Noah shows us

01:40:03.060 --> 01:40:04.060
Here, look at this shot right there

01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:05.060
Look at that

01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:06.060
You can see the rig we're working on

01:40:06.060 --> 01:40:08.060
And we talk to our patrons about that

01:40:08.060 --> 01:40:10.060
We try to do those from time to time

01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:11.060
For our

01:40:11.060 --> 01:40:12.060
Oh jeez

01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:13.060
Don't put Rekai in the shot

01:40:13.060 --> 01:40:14.060
There's almost a beard in the shot

01:40:14.060 --> 01:40:15.060
That's for the patrons only

01:40:15.060 --> 01:40:16.060
Yeah, yeah

01:40:16.060 --> 01:40:17.060
Cannot show that on the May studio

01:40:17.060 --> 01:40:18.060
See that right there

01:40:18.060 --> 01:40:19.060
Is worth signing up to be a patron

01:40:19.060 --> 01:40:21.060
Yeah, patreon.com slash today

01:40:21.060 --> 01:40:24.060
The money raised there isn't just for the Tech Talk Today show

01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:26.060
It is for all of the shows

01:40:26.060 --> 01:40:28.060
And Tech Talk Today is the way I thank you for that

01:40:28.060 --> 01:40:29.060
And with that

01:40:29.060 --> 01:40:31.060
We're going to have some announcements

01:40:31.060 --> 01:40:32.060
Of where that funding is going

01:40:32.060 --> 01:40:34.060
But it helps us build a little runway and predictability

01:40:34.060 --> 01:40:36.060
Without having to increase our sponsor load

01:40:36.060 --> 01:40:37.060
Patreon.com slash today

01:40:37.060 --> 01:40:38.060
Also, last but not least

01:40:38.060 --> 01:40:41.060
I'd love to get submissions from the audience for Runs Linux

01:40:41.060 --> 01:40:42.060
If you have a cool Runs Linux rig

01:40:42.060 --> 01:40:43.060
Get some video or audio of it

01:40:43.060 --> 01:40:44.060
Or pictures of it

01:40:44.060 --> 01:40:46.060
And send it to linuxactionshow at jupiterbroadcasting.com

01:40:46.060 --> 01:40:48.060
If it's like a YouTube video

01:40:48.060 --> 01:40:50.060
You can upload that ass and send us a link

01:40:50.060 --> 01:40:51.060
We'd totes appreciate that

01:40:51.060 --> 01:40:54.060
And then we'll feature it on an episode of the Linux Action Show

01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:57.060
Now, we have a lot of really good episodes in the pipeline

01:40:57.060 --> 01:40:58.060
For the Linux Action Show

01:40:58.060 --> 01:41:00.060
So tune in on Sundays as well

01:41:00.060 --> 01:41:02.060
10 a.m. Pacific, jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar

01:41:02.060 --> 01:41:03.060
And if you want to make this show better

01:41:03.060 --> 01:41:05.060
Linuxactionshow.reddit.com

01:41:05.060 --> 01:41:06.060
Including the feedback thread

01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:08.060
To share your thoughts on anything we talked about today

01:41:08.060 --> 01:41:09.060
Noah

01:41:09.060 --> 01:41:10.060
Yes sir

01:41:10.060 --> 01:41:11.060
Is there any place you'd like to plug for folks to check out

01:41:11.060 --> 01:41:12.060
For you throughout the week

01:41:12.060 --> 01:41:13.060
You can head over to AltaSpeed

01:41:13.060 --> 01:41:14.060
There you go

01:41:14.060 --> 01:41:15.060
And check out what I do during the day

01:41:15.060 --> 01:41:16.060
In fact, actually

01:41:16.060 --> 01:41:18.060
I think next week on Linux Action Show

01:41:18.060 --> 01:41:21.060
You're going to find a slightly different aspect

01:41:21.060 --> 01:41:22.060
Of AltaSpeed

01:41:22.060 --> 01:41:23.060
That we haven't really talked about before

01:41:23.060 --> 01:41:24.060
Yeah, we're going to have a feature on that

01:41:24.060 --> 01:41:25.060
Also, check out my new Twitter account

01:41:25.060 --> 01:41:26.060
I've changed

01:41:26.060 --> 01:41:27.060
But it's still chrisles

01:41:27.060 --> 01:41:28.060
You just have to re-follow it

01:41:28.060 --> 01:41:29.060
At chrisles

01:41:29.060 --> 01:41:30.060
Alright everybody, thanks so much for tuning in to this week's episode of

01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:31.060
Linux Unplugged

01:41:31.060 --> 01:41:32.060
See you right back here

01:41:32.060 --> 01:41:52.060
Next week!

01:42:02.060 --> 01:42:03.060
Alright, JBtitles.com

01:42:03.060 --> 01:42:04.060
JBtitles

01:42:04.060 --> 01:42:05.060
Let's go

01:42:05.060 --> 01:42:06.060
And a last chance to vote

01:42:06.060 --> 01:42:08.060
We've got the Fedora 22 discussion in here

01:42:08.060 --> 01:42:10.060
We have a lot of topics we talked about today

01:42:10.060 --> 01:42:11.060
So, JBtitles.com

01:42:11.060 --> 01:42:12.060
And we'll pick that

01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:15.060
Disjoint of normal Fedora

01:42:15.060 --> 01:42:16.060
Do not Fedora

01:42:16.060 --> 01:42:17.060
Wow, Fed up with Fed up

01:42:17.060 --> 01:42:18.060
Wow

01:42:18.060 --> 01:42:19.060
The year of the Linux laptop

01:42:19.060 --> 01:42:21.060
Ooh, that's not bad, Ubi

01:42:21.060 --> 01:42:22.060
That's not bad

01:42:22.060 --> 01:42:23.060
Carboard container catastrophe

01:42:23.060 --> 01:42:24.060
That's not bad either

01:42:24.060 --> 01:42:25.060
Some good ones

01:42:25.060 --> 01:42:26.060
Dell recommends Ubuntu

01:42:26.060 --> 01:42:27.060
Mmm

01:42:27.060 --> 01:42:28.060
Mmm

01:42:28.060 --> 01:42:30.060
Crappy desktop environment

01:42:30.060 --> 01:42:31.060
Ouch, guys

01:42:31.060 --> 01:42:32.060
Ouch

01:42:32.060 --> 01:42:33.060
What's a crappy desktop environment?

01:42:33.060 --> 01:42:34.060
Well, I don't know

01:42:34.060 --> 01:42:37.060
Apparently somebody thinks something's crappy

01:42:37.060 --> 01:42:38.060
JBtitles.com

01:42:38.060 --> 01:42:39.060
JBtitles.com

01:42:39.060 --> 01:42:40.060
What'd you think, Mr. Noah?

01:42:40.060 --> 01:42:41.060
What'd you think?

01:42:41.060 --> 01:42:42.060
What are we doing after this?

01:42:42.060 --> 01:42:43.060
I'm gonna decode a radio

01:42:43.060 --> 01:42:44.060
What are you doing?

01:42:44.060 --> 01:42:45.060
Really, really isn't it what you think of this?

01:42:45.060 --> 01:42:46.060
What are you doing after this?

01:42:46.060 --> 01:42:47.060
Uh, well

01:42:47.060 --> 01:42:48.060
Rekai and I are gonna cuddle

01:42:48.060 --> 01:42:49.060
Ooh, nice

01:42:49.060 --> 01:42:50.060
And, and, and

01:42:50.060 --> 01:42:51.060
Burgers, right?

01:42:51.060 --> 01:42:52.060
You're gonna get burgers

01:42:52.060 --> 01:42:53.060
I have to give him five guys

01:42:53.060 --> 01:42:54.060
Cause he, uh

01:42:54.060 --> 01:42:56.060
He gets really crabby if you don't give him five guys

01:42:56.060 --> 01:42:57.060
Yeah

01:42:57.060 --> 01:42:58.060
Yeah

01:42:58.060 --> 01:42:59.060
Yeah, for sure

01:42:59.060 --> 01:43:00.060
He comes out and he's like

01:43:00.060 --> 01:43:01.060
Where's my five guys?

01:43:01.060 --> 01:43:02.060
Yeah, and he hits you

01:43:02.060 --> 01:43:03.060
He whips you with his beard

01:43:03.060 --> 01:43:04.060
He, that happens

01:43:04.060 --> 01:43:06.060
Uh, disjointive, uh

01:43:06.060 --> 01:43:07.060
Disjunctive

01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:08.060
Disjunctive, uh

01:43:08.060 --> 01:43:09.060
Normal fedora

01:43:09.060 --> 01:43:10.060
I misspelled it

01:43:10.060 --> 01:43:11.060
Can't even

01:43:11.060 --> 01:43:12.060
What are you trying to say?

01:43:12.060 --> 01:43:14.060
It was disjunctive normal form

01:43:14.060 --> 01:43:17.060
And I changed it to just disjunctive normal fedora

01:43:17.060 --> 01:43:20.060
Carboard container catastrophe and year of the Linux laptop

01:43:20.060 --> 01:43:21.060
Are our top contenders

01:43:21.060 --> 01:43:22.060
JBtitles.com

01:43:22.060 --> 01:43:23.060
It's a tight vote

01:43:23.060 --> 01:43:24.060
It's a tight, tight, tight, tight vote

01:43:24.060 --> 01:43:25.060
So, um

01:43:25.060 --> 01:43:26.060
You guys

01:43:26.060 --> 01:43:27.060
I got a little

01:43:27.060 --> 01:43:28.060
I got a little anecdote for you

01:43:28.060 --> 01:43:29.060
Wanna hear an anecdote?

01:43:29.060 --> 01:43:30.060
I don't know if you would actually

01:43:30.060 --> 01:43:31.060
Oh, okay

01:43:31.060 --> 01:43:33.060
Cause it's gonna be a rip on fedora

01:43:33.060 --> 01:43:34.060
Why would I do that, dude?

01:43:34.060 --> 01:43:35.060
I don't know

01:43:35.060 --> 01:43:36.060
We just

01:43:36.060 --> 01:43:37.060
Do not fedora

01:43:37.060 --> 01:43:38.060
Why would you do that?

01:43:38.060 --> 01:43:39.060
Why would I do that?

01:43:39.060 --> 01:43:40.060
Why would you do that?

01:43:40.060 --> 01:43:41.060
So, uh

01:43:41.060 --> 01:43:42.060
You know, uh

01:43:42.060 --> 01:43:43.060
It kinda goes like this, you guys

01:43:43.060 --> 01:43:44.060
Um

01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:45.060
Before, uh

01:43:45.060 --> 01:43:46.060
Before Noah came out

01:43:46.060 --> 01:43:47.060
Rekai comes into the studio

01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:48.060
And he says to me

01:43:48.060 --> 01:43:49.060
He says, you know

01:43:49.060 --> 01:43:50.060
Noah and I have been talking

01:43:50.060 --> 01:43:51.060
Like, they've been talking offline for a while

01:43:51.060 --> 01:43:53.060
About what a mess it is in the studio

01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:54.060
And about

01:43:54.060 --> 01:43:55.060
And about how

01:43:55.060 --> 01:43:56.060
They're gonna come in here

01:43:56.060 --> 01:43:57.060
And, you know

01:43:57.060 --> 01:43:58.060
It's just time for the professionals to come in

01:43:58.060 --> 01:43:59.060
And clean up

01:43:59.060 --> 01:44:00.060
Because

01:44:00.060 --> 01:44:01.060
You know

01:44:01.060 --> 01:44:02.060
You know, Chris

01:44:02.060 --> 01:44:03.060
You just haven't been able to figure it out

01:44:03.060 --> 01:44:04.060
So, yeah

01:44:04.060 --> 01:44:05.060
The big boys are gonna come in

01:44:05.060 --> 01:44:06.060
Yeah

01:44:06.060 --> 01:44:07.060
And we're gonna clean up this wiring mess

01:44:07.060 --> 01:44:08.060
And, uh

01:44:08.060 --> 01:44:09.060
Make sure that all this is cleaned up

01:44:09.060 --> 01:44:10.060
So, if he has any audio issues

01:44:10.060 --> 01:44:11.060
It must be cause of that

01:44:11.060 --> 01:44:12.060
Well, ladies and gentlemen

01:44:12.060 --> 01:44:13.060
I am happy to tell you

01:44:13.060 --> 01:44:14.060
As I stand here

01:44:14.060 --> 01:44:15.060
The wiring mess is now ten times worse

01:44:15.060 --> 01:44:16.060
Oh, okay

01:44:16.060 --> 01:44:17.060
Ten times worse

01:44:17.060 --> 01:44:18.060
So, you prefer the buzz

01:44:18.060 --> 01:44:19.060
Uh-huh

01:44:19.060 --> 01:44:20.060
Is what you're saying

01:44:20.060 --> 01:44:21.060
Uh-huh

01:44:21.060 --> 01:44:22.060
I'm just saying

01:44:22.060 --> 01:44:23.060
I'm just saying

01:44:23.060 --> 01:44:24.060
Your audio buzz is gone

01:44:24.060 --> 01:44:25.060
I got schooled on my wiring

01:44:25.060 --> 01:44:26.060
And how it's gonna be all cleaned up

01:44:26.060 --> 01:44:27.060
And then you guys

01:44:27.060 --> 01:44:28.060
Look at that mess right there

01:44:28.060 --> 01:44:29.060
Yeah

01:44:29.060 --> 01:44:30.060
Yeah

01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:31.060
So, uh

01:44:31.060 --> 01:44:32.060
I love

01:44:32.060 --> 01:44:33.060
You're very good at presenting one side of the story

01:44:33.060 --> 01:44:34.060
Oh, am I?

01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:35.060
Yeah, yeah

01:44:35.060 --> 01:44:36.060
You're very good

01:44:36.060 --> 01:44:37.060
So, here

01:44:37.060 --> 01:44:38.060
So, here's the thing

01:44:38.060 --> 01:44:39.060
First of all

01:44:39.060 --> 01:44:40.060
I

01:44:40.060 --> 01:44:41.060
The

01:44:41.060 --> 01:44:42.060
Here

01:44:42.060 --> 01:44:43.060
The cables that I have to work with

01:44:43.060 --> 01:44:44.060
Are the

01:44:44.060 --> 01:44:45.060
Are the spare ones that are in the box

01:44:45.060 --> 01:44:46.060
Because, you know

01:44:46.060 --> 01:44:47.060
This is an interesting argument you make

01:44:47.060 --> 01:44:48.060
And I like it

01:44:48.060 --> 01:44:49.060
So, your argument is

01:44:49.060 --> 01:44:50.060
And this is great

01:44:50.060 --> 01:44:51.060
Oh, no

01:44:51.060 --> 01:44:52.060
The reason

01:44:52.060 --> 01:44:53.060
Hold on

01:44:53.060 --> 01:44:54.060
Let me tell you what he's about to do

01:44:54.060 --> 01:44:55.060
Everyone

01:44:55.060 --> 01:44:56.060
So, just so you can appreciate this

01:44:56.060 --> 01:44:57.060
This is a destroyable argument

01:44:57.060 --> 01:44:58.060
And he's going to do it in

01:44:58.060 --> 01:45:02.060
In such a quick and precise manner that you'd think that he sat up all night and rehearsed

01:45:02.060 --> 01:45:03.060
No, it's just

01:45:03.060 --> 01:45:04.060
It's obvious

01:45:04.060 --> 01:45:05.060
Oh, okay

01:45:05.060 --> 01:45:06.060
I think it's funny that this is your argument

01:45:06.060 --> 01:45:07.060
So, your argument is

01:45:07.060 --> 01:45:08.060
If I understand it correctly

01:45:08.060 --> 01:45:09.060
Yeah

01:45:09.060 --> 01:45:10.060
That this would not be such a mess

01:45:10.060 --> 01:45:12.060
If you didn't have to use just the random assortment of odd cables I have

01:45:12.060 --> 01:45:13.060
Yes, actually that is exactly my argument

01:45:13.060 --> 01:45:14.060
Right

01:45:14.060 --> 01:45:15.060
So, my argument is as such

01:45:15.060 --> 01:45:18.060
It wasn't such a mess when I used those same exact cables

01:45:18.060 --> 01:45:19.060
Yeah, but

01:45:19.060 --> 01:45:20.060
I have the same cables

01:45:20.060 --> 01:45:21.060
Oh, so

01:45:21.060 --> 01:45:22.060
I use the same cables

01:45:22.060 --> 01:45:23.060
So, hold on a second

01:45:23.060 --> 01:45:24.060
So, what you're saying is

01:45:24.060 --> 01:45:25.060
I don't make that mess

01:45:25.060 --> 01:45:28.060
But the guy who was in charge of Jupiter Broadcasting was in this room and ordered all those cables

01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:31.060
to begin with when he decided that he was going to move his studio from his house over

01:45:31.060 --> 01:45:32.060
to this studio over here

01:45:32.060 --> 01:45:33.060
Now, here's the thing

01:45:33.060 --> 01:45:34.060
Now, that happened

01:45:34.060 --> 01:45:35.060
Somehow

01:45:35.060 --> 01:45:38.060
Somehow, the same amount of computers is in this room that was in this room before

01:45:38.060 --> 01:45:39.060
Right, except

01:45:39.060 --> 01:45:40.060
But there's way more wires now

01:45:40.060 --> 01:45:41.060
Yeah, and the reason

01:45:41.060 --> 01:45:42.060
And the reason for that is

01:45:42.060 --> 01:45:44.060
You say it's because they're an eclectic set of wires

01:45:44.060 --> 01:45:45.060
Right

01:45:45.060 --> 01:45:46.060
Except for when I used that set of wires

01:45:46.060 --> 01:45:47.060
Yes

01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:48.060
It was not this messy

01:45:48.060 --> 01:45:49.060
You did, but you also didn't have stereo in and out of the M-Audio

01:45:49.060 --> 01:45:50.060
So, you weren't feeding stereo to the Mumble Room

01:45:50.060 --> 01:45:52.060
We don't have stereo return into the

01:45:52.060 --> 01:45:53.060
Oh, I'm not done yet

01:45:53.060 --> 01:45:54.060
That's just one thing

01:45:54.060 --> 01:45:55.060
There are so many things that I've done

01:45:55.060 --> 01:45:56.060
Pause, because you're painting a bad picture

01:45:56.060 --> 01:45:57.060
Oh, okay

01:45:57.060 --> 01:45:58.060
That's a very compelling argument

01:45:58.060 --> 01:45:59.060
Yeah

01:45:59.060 --> 01:46:02.060
Except for the fact that all of those cables are like three feet long and they're on the

01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:03.060
other end of the room

01:46:03.060 --> 01:46:04.060
Yes

01:46:04.060 --> 01:46:05.060
Over there

01:46:05.060 --> 01:46:06.060
None of this mess is because of that fix

01:46:06.060 --> 01:46:07.060
All right, all right, all right, fair enough

01:46:07.060 --> 01:46:11.060
But, but, so, to get that, so, so, we have, we have improvement, so it's not the same

01:46:11.060 --> 01:46:12.060
setup as it was before that

01:46:12.060 --> 01:46:14.060
I was destroying that argument independently

01:46:14.060 --> 01:46:18.060
But, now, but the reason that, the real reason for that cable mess back there

01:46:18.060 --> 01:46:19.060
Uh-huh

01:46:19.060 --> 01:46:20.060
That rat's nest

01:46:20.060 --> 01:46:21.060
Yeah

01:46:21.060 --> 01:46:22.060
That horrible mess

01:46:22.060 --> 01:46:23.060
Yeah

01:46:23.060 --> 01:46:24.060
It's in the wrong spot, it knocks the PC over

01:46:24.060 --> 01:46:25.060
That, that's happened once

01:46:25.060 --> 01:46:26.060
Which actually happened during the show

01:46:26.060 --> 01:46:27.060
Twice

01:46:27.060 --> 01:46:32.060
So, so, the reason for that is, is because since we don't have actual, enough HDMI cables

01:46:32.060 --> 01:46:35.060
to go all the way over here, I can't put the computer where it was before

01:46:35.060 --> 01:46:39.060
So, it has to go on the floor so that this, this godforsaken VGA cable, which I haven't

01:46:39.060 --> 01:46:41.060
used a VGA cable in probably ten years

01:46:41.060 --> 01:46:45.060
Somehow I, I have to use it, because that's the only way that you can see this on here

01:46:45.060 --> 01:46:49.060
So, the, what we could do if, if the cable mess bothers you that much is I could go back

01:46:49.060 --> 01:46:52.060
and put the nook back in, we could go back to a buzz

01:46:52.060 --> 01:46:53.060
Because

01:46:53.060 --> 01:46:54.060
But again

01:46:54.060 --> 01:46:55.060
The buzz is kind of nice actually

01:46:55.060 --> 01:46:56.060
None of this changes the buzz

01:46:56.060 --> 01:46:57.060
It does change the buzz, the buzz is gone

01:46:57.060 --> 01:47:01.060
No, this PC, if it wasn't for that VGA cable, could be on the other end of the room

01:47:01.060 --> 01:47:02.060
Yeah, that's true

01:47:02.060 --> 01:47:03.060
Yeah

01:47:03.060 --> 01:47:05.060
So, what you're saying is I should go to Best Buy and buy a, a, what do I need?

01:47:05.060 --> 01:47:06.060
Oh, you know what, actually, you know what

01:47:06.060 --> 01:47:07.060
I don't know

01:47:07.060 --> 01:47:08.060
Oh no, I'm about to destroy my own argument

01:47:08.060 --> 01:47:11.060
It's not an HDMI cable that we need, it's another HDMI output

01:47:11.060 --> 01:47:12.060
Yeah

01:47:12.060 --> 01:47:13.060
On the box

01:47:13.060 --> 01:47:14.060
Yeah, we do

01:47:14.060 --> 01:47:15.060
Well, I could go buy an HDMI splitter

01:47:15.060 --> 01:47:16.060
VGA's fun

01:47:16.060 --> 01:47:17.060
So

01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:18.060
Yeah

01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:21.060
So, yeah, so now, and now of course Noah flies out tomorrow morning

01:47:21.060 --> 01:47:22.060
And leaves me with a mess

01:47:22.060 --> 01:47:23.060
Yeah

01:47:23.060 --> 01:47:24.060
But that's fine

01:47:24.060 --> 01:47:25.060
That's fine

01:47:25.060 --> 01:47:26.060
That can be, that can be

01:47:26.060 --> 01:47:30.060
There's a reason that I plan to, I plan for longer, just in case I need to

01:47:30.060 --> 01:47:33.060
Well, I wonder what a spectrum analyzer would look like right there

01:47:33.060 --> 01:47:36.060
They say in the chat room, it looks like a pit of doom

01:47:36.060 --> 01:47:37.060
I have a spectrum analyzer

01:47:37.060 --> 01:47:40.060
I should have photoshopped this a little bit and added some additional cables

01:47:40.060 --> 01:47:41.060
Yeah, yeah, should you

01:47:41.060 --> 01:47:42.060
Yeah

01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:44.060
I'll tell you what, I'll come in here while you're in the middle of Coder Radio

01:47:44.060 --> 01:47:45.060
Yeah, there you go

01:47:45.060 --> 01:47:46.060
Yeah

01:47:46.060 --> 01:47:47.060
Good, good

01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:48.060
Alright, speaking of that, we gotta go

01:47:48.060 --> 01:47:49.060
So, let's see where our titles are

01:47:49.060 --> 01:47:51.060
JBtitles.com, JBtitles.com

01:47:51.060 --> 01:47:53.060
And I'm refreshing

01:47:53.060 --> 01:47:57.060
And our top vote is, ladies and gentlemen, Disjunctive Normal Fedora

01:47:57.060 --> 01:47:58.060
Really?

01:47:58.060 --> 01:48:00.060
I guess you guys like the clever ones, huh?

01:48:00.060 --> 01:48:02.060
Which do you, do you have a preference there, Noah?

01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:05.060
Mine is still the year of the Linux laptop

01:48:05.060 --> 01:48:10.060
But that's only because I really like the idea that we're gonna have a year of the Linux laptop

01:48:10.060 --> 01:48:11.060
What?

01:48:11.060 --> 01:48:13.060
We've had one every year for the past 15 years

01:48:13.060 --> 01:48:14.060
Yeah, right

01:48:14.060 --> 01:48:15.060
No, that's the Linux desktop

01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:16.060
Now we're in the Linux laptop

01:48:16.060 --> 01:48:17.060
Catch up

01:48:17.060 --> 01:48:19.060
I'm on a different level

01:48:19.060 --> 01:48:23.060
The desktop, oh burn, the desktop is a part of the laptop

01:48:23.060 --> 01:48:24.060
Oh, is that how that works?

01:48:24.060 --> 01:48:27.060
Alright, alright, we'll go with Disjunctive Normal Fedora, that's fine

01:48:27.060 --> 01:48:30.060
I like it, I like it enough, we can do it, I think that's pretty good

01:48:30.060 --> 01:48:47.060
And I like Blaster
