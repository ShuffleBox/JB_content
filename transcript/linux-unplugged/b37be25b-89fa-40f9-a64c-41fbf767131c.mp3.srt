1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now that we're through the holidays, it's the season of events.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,900
And there's one that I was just looking through our list that we don't have in here.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,700
And maybe it's because it's like outside the US.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,800
But we got to include everybody, right?

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,100
Of course we do. That just wouldn't be fair.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,100
No, exactly.

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,200
Oddcamp 2019. That didn't make our list for this week's episode.

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,400
It's going to be in Manchester October 19th.

9
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,200
Jeez, that's like forever from now. That's like forever from now.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,000
It is. So you have plenty of time to plan your trip.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,800
Oddcamp is an unconference celebrating free culture,

12
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,600
free and open source software, hardware hacking, digital rights,

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,600
and all manner of collaborative cultural activities.

14
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,400
It'd be pretty fun to go, Wes.

15
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,500
I mean, I'm just saying.

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,400
I know.

17
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,900
Chris and Wes, mess up Manchester.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I can hear it now.

19
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,300
Yeah, you said it first.

20
00:00:47,300 --> 00:01:03,300
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 285, for January 22nd, 2019.

21
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,200
Oh, hey there, and welcome into Linux Unplugged,

22
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,300
your weekly Linux talk show that's all over the world recording live

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,300
and mostly has its crap together.

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,300
My name is Chris.

25
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,700
My name is Wes. And speak for yourself, Chris.

26
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,200
Hello, Mr. Payne.

27
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,900
You know, I should, I should.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,200
It's just, when I look at today's episode,

29
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,700
I think we must be going at an unbelievable,

30
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,700
unstoppable pace, if you will.

31
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,700
We have a bunch of really interesting community news,

32
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,700
some that's getting a lot of attention.

33
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,200
I don't know why it's getting so much attention,

34
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,400
but we'll have Wes break it all down for us.

35
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,200
Then we have a bunch of great updates,

36
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,200
so many things to announce and to cover today.

37
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,400
A lot of stuff going on in the community.

38
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,100
Then we'll chat with someone, an individual,

39
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,600
one crazy person out there,

40
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,100
who hopes to make the next design tool for Linux

41
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,300
to build applications, not just for Linux,

42
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,800
but for other operating systems as well.

43
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,900
And it's one of those tools that when you talk to developers,

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,400
Linux desperately needs.

45
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,300
And the plan to fund this thing is rather unique

46
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,300
and seems like they could actually pull it off.

47
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,300
So we'll bring on Alex, the main developer and originator

48
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,800
behind this project,

49
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,700
and see what he has planned.

50
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,700
Then, in the second half of the show,

51
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,700
it's undeniable that open source is facing a new,

52
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,700
quote-unquote, headwind.

53
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,700
Yeah, there's your business speak for you.

54
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,700
And it's obvious when you look at things like

55
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,700
the recent MongoDB relicensing,

56
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,700
AWS's announcement of DocumentDB,

57
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,700
which is a MongoDB rip-off,

58
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,700
and so many other things that open source projects

59
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,700
that are server-side projects

60
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,700
that we're hoping for some significant funding

61
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,600
once they grew to a certain size

62
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,600
are being replaced by commercial products

63
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,600
that offer all of the wonderful benefits

64
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,600
of these commercial products

65
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,600
and none of the openness.

66
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,600
And it's a massive problem

67
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,600
that's actually impacting the way

68
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,600
these open source projects get funded.

69
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,600
So we'll talk about that,

70
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,600
and I'll give you my first impressions

71
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,600
of Ubuntu 19.04 Disco Dingo,

72
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,600
which I've been running here for a few days.

73
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:10,500
And it's fast.

74
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,500
I'll tell you a little bit about that.

75
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,500
But before we go any stinking further into the show,

76
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,500
we must bring in that virtual lug.

77
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,500
Time-appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

78
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,500
Good morning, everyone.

79
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,500
Greetings.

80
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,500
Hello.

81
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,500
Hello, Bruce and Cubicle Nate

82
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,500
and Mini Mac and Sean and Brent.

83
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,500
It's good to see you back as well.

84
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,500
How has your travels gone?

85
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,500
I'm still traveling.

86
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,500
It's kind of a crazy, crazy time.

87
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,500
Wow, of course you are.

88
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,400
I know.

89
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,400
I know it's nuts.

90
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,400
But good to be a little bit closer

91
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,400
to you guys in the world.

92
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,400
Where are you?

93
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,400
That's a great question.

94
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,400
I'm currently in...

95
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,400
That doesn't sound like you know, Brent, honestly.

96
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,400
I'm starting to piece it together.

97
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,400
I'm currently in B.C.,

98
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,400
sort of like southeastern B.C.

99
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,400
Next week I'm in Quebec City,

100
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,400
and we'll see after that.

101
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,400
Okay, I'm in Texas,

102
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,400
and Wes is in Seattle,

103
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,400
so it's a good spread.

104
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,400
We've got a good spread going here today.

105
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,400
So let's start with the story

106
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,300
that you may see shared the most right now.

107
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,300
If you're listening around the time

108
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,300
this episode is released,

109
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,300
which is around the last

110
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,300
or second week of January-ish,

111
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,300
depending on when you're listening to this,

112
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,300
there is a lot of discussion right now

113
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,300
about vulnerabilities in apt,

114
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,300
including remote code execution,

115
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,300
which is also leading to other discussions

116
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,300
about using HTTP versus HTTPS.

117
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,300
So Wes, I was hoping maybe you could break down

118
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,300
like what is the big hoopla about right now

119
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,300
in regards to remote code execution

120
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,200
and the man-in-the-middle attacks with apt.

121
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,200
Oh yeah, it's been making the rounds today.

122
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,200
And a security researcher by the name of Max

123
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,200
found a remote code execution vulnerability

124
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,200
in apt and apt-get.

125
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,200
And really the first thing you should acknowledge,

126
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,200
and we've talked about this before,

127
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,200
is when you install packages,

128
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,200
well, at least in the apt system,

129
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,200
they have root access to your file system

130
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,200
so bad things can happen.

131
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,200
It's important to trust where your packages come from

132
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,200
and go through the hoops to verify

133
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,200
that that package actually came from the source you expect.

134
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,100
Now combine that with the fact that,

135
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,100
by default, at least in Ubuntu and Debian,

136
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,100
your system is generally not set up

137
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,100
to use an HTTPS mirror.

138
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,100
So just plain text over HTTP.

139
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,100
Now, most of the time that's just fine, right?

140
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,100
As we said, there's usually at least checksums

141
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,100
and almost always a GPG signature involved.

142
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,100
So you can go check and verify

143
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,100
that the package is valid.

144
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,100
Yeah, so the actual packages,

145
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,100
even if it's coming down over HTTP,

146
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,100
the actual packages have signatures.

147
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,000
Yes, okay, so here's where it gets a little bit trickier.

148
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,000
Now, internally, when apt runs,

149
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,000
it has an internal helper for HTTP.

150
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,000
So the main process sort of spawns it off

151
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,000
and says, here's all the packages I'm working on.

152
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,000
Go do all the HTTP stuff.

153
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,000
And then that process responds back over a socket

154
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,000
to the main process with, like,

155
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,000
oh, here's the URL or, you know,

156
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,000
there was a redirect or 404,

157
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,000
whatever the particulars of the transaction might be.

158
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,000
What you didn't expect, though,

159
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,000
is that, of course, it's an older utility

160
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,000
and it's not a nice protocol

161
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,900
and no, no, it's just line delimited plain text.

162
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,900
Yeah, exactly.

163
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,900
And the HTTP helper doesn't really handle the redirects.

164
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,900
It reports the redirect

165
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,900
and then the main process decides what to do,

166
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,900
usually then issues a new request,

167
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,900
you know, for wherever the new resource

168
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,900
can actually be found after the redirect.

169
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,900
There's like a multi-process architecture here

170
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,900
where there's one part of apt

171
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,900
that becomes aware of a redirect.

172
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,900
It captures that and then it delivers it

173
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,900
to another part of apt which then makes the decision.

174
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,800
Yes, and also the helper is responsible

175
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,800
for handling, like, unencoding,

176
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,800
unescaping all the URL parameters,

177
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,800
but it just blindly includes that in its output.

178
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,800
It doesn't sanitize it.

179
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,800
It doesn't make sure that it's carefully delimited.

180
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,800
It just hands that right back to the main process.

181
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,800
And so someone could sneak something in there, basically.

182
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,800
Exactly.

183
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,800
So if you construct a malicious URL in your redirect,

184
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,800
you can basically tell the main process

185
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,800
to go download any arbitrary package you want,

186
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,700
which includes any arbitrary signature

187
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,700
and because as we talked about,

188
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,700
packages have root access,

189
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,700
that's a remote code vulnerability.

190
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,700
Okay, okay, okay.

191
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,700
So really, it's a couple of things here.

192
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,700
I mean, essentially, at the core of it,

193
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,700
it's a man-in-the-middle attack

194
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,700
which perhaps something like using HTTPS

195
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,700
would potentially help with.

196
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,700
So even though the packages have signatures,

197
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,700
doing everything over HTTP means

198
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,600
that the things aren't getting verified as they would

199
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,600
if they was using HTTPS, correct?

200
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,600
Right, so yeah, basically, there's two possible attacks

201
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,600
and one is a compromised mirror itself, right?

202
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,600
Somebody takes over the mirror that you're using

203
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,600
and HTTPS doesn't help you there.

204
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,600
You're kind of just screwed and your trust is broken.

205
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,600
But the bigger thing and the thing that HTTPS

206
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,600
can protect against is network attacks,

207
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,600
things like BGP hijacks or anytime someone

208
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,600
is able to be a man-in-the-middle,

209
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,600
change your connection so that you are presented

210
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,600
with someone who's not real.

211
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,500
If you've got an HTTPS connection,

212
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,500
then you have a root certificate somewhere

213
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,500
that presumably your man-in-the-middle attacker

214
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,500
can't attack or at least it's a lot harder to do that

215
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,500
than just to, say, put a man-in-the-middle

216
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,500
between you and your corporate firewall.

217
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,500
Okay, so what's going on here?

218
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,500
Because I did a little looking around.

219
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:11,500
OpenSUSE's zipper uses HTTPS, DNF uses HTTPS.

220
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,500
Why is Ubuntu and Debian not using HTTPS?

221
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,500
Seems like they should be.

222
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,500
You know, that's a good question

223
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,400
and it's kind of been quite the debate

224
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,400
for a number of years.

225
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,400
Now, of course, you can use HTTPS.

226
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,400
It makes some things like setting up,

227
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,400
easily setting up caches in between,

228
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,400
it makes those things harder.

229
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,400
So there are some downsides.

230
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,400
And you might have less mirror selection, of course.

231
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,400
But security really comes down to defense in depth.

232
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,400
And so while most of the time signatures are enough,

233
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,400
HTTPS can really be helpful.

234
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,400
So it seems like why not make that the default?

235
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,400
You can still have HTTPS available as a fallback.

236
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,300
That's fine.

237
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,300
Just let users have the most security right out of the gate.

238
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,300
I think it's worth mentioning

239
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,300
that this isn't just a theoretical threat.

240
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,300
On March 9th, 2018,

241
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,300
there was a report that a Turkish ISP

242
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,300
had swapped the downloads of popular software

243
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,300
with their own hosted spyware infected versions.

244
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,300
Now, this was mostly targeted at Windows users

245
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,300
so us Linux users don't really need to worry about it that much.

246
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,300
But the concept is the same.

247
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,300
And a lot of tools that you would download

248
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,200
to just make your Windows box run decent

249
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,200
were replaced with their own infected versions of the applications

250
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,200
where the download links were just using HTTP.

251
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,200
And it does kind of make you think

252
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,200
like this could be done on a larger scale.

253
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:33,200
Say, this could be an attack against all Ubuntu users potentially.

254
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,200
It might not be a common threat, but it is a very real threat.

255
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,200
Well, you still, remember, have the package signatures here.

256
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,200
You still have to have a valid package

257
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,200
that passes the signature check.

258
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,200
But that assumes that everything from the get-go

259
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,100
was set up without a man in the middle.

260
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,100
Right. And with this vulnerability,

261
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,100
it was possible to add additional...

262
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,100
Because you can have these same problems,

263
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,100
let's say, if you started off with something

264
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,100
that was affected from the ISO,

265
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,100
which is often also not served over HTTPS.

266
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,100
Oh, no. Oh, no.

267
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,100
Now we're going down a rabbit hole of paranoia.

268
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,100
But it is something I think that is worth thinking about.

269
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,100
And it's gotten a lot of attention.

270
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,100
We should note, too, that this is already patched

271
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,000
in recent versions of apt.

272
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,000
And you can mitigate it just by enabling HTTPS

273
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,000
and using an HTTPS repo.

274
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,000
So go do those things if you need to.

275
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,000
In both Debian and Ubuntu, this has been patched,

276
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,000
but you have to be on a supported version, obviously,

277
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,000
to get those fixes.

278
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,000
Do you think this is something that they'll address?

279
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,000
Do you think in a period of time we'll see HTTPS apt mirrors?

280
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,000
Or is this something that will just kick down for a while?

281
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,000
This is a can that will continue to get kicked.

282
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,000
What do you think?

283
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,000
Oh, that's hard to say.

284
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,000
You know, I could see it certainly in Ubuntu.

285
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,900
The times, the landscape, it's changing.

286
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,900
HTTPS is just about everywhere.

287
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,900
There's been a lot of pushers browser side.

288
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,900
I think everyone's just a little more comfortable with it.

289
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,900
So the time's ripe.

290
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,900
Yeah.

291
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,900
Yeah.

292
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,900
All right.

293
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,900
Well, let's shift gears and talk about something

294
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,900
that I think is the Linux user's version of defragging your disk.

295
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,900
At least it is for me.

296
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,900
You know, when you talk to Windows users,

297
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,900
they'll talk about how they love watching disk defrag

298
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,900
because it's sort of peaceful,

299
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,900
like just to sit there and watch the data reassemble.

300
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,800
And then they used to debate, like, when should you defrag the disk

301
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,800
and all these kinds of things.

302
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,800
Well, I do this myself with the Linux scheduler.

303
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,800
I'm constantly wondering, like, am I using the best IO scheduler?

304
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:24,800
Am I using an IO scheduler for a server when I'm in a desktop environment?

305
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:29,800
I've also heard that Manjaro will ship a desktop optimized IO scheduler.

306
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:34,800
And I guess, Wes, while we're still having you break things down for us,

307
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,800
I wanted to have you break down this story.

308
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,700
To the best of your ability, what the hell is an IO scheduler?

309
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,700
And then kind of related to that,

310
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,700
could you talk about this article that we found

311
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,700
where they attempted to use eBPF,

312
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,700
which is a new feature in the Linux kernel,

313
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,700
which is super cool that we should talk about too.

314
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,700
They attempted to use eBPF to determine which IO scheduler is the best.

315
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,700
Yeah, absolutely.

316
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,700
Okay, so there you are, Mr. Chris Fisher,

317
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,700
and you're doing a recording, you're making Linux unplugged,

318
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,700
and you got to save those bytes to disk.

319
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,700
So you tell your operating system.

320
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,600
I mean, really, you request your operating system,

321
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,600
go save these files to the disk, please.

322
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,600
But of course, you know, there's multiple blocks involved there.

323
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,600
Your disk is probably already doing other things from other processes

324
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,600
and maybe users running on that system.

325
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,600
So you got to have a schedule, in this case, an IO schedule.

326
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,600
And that's basically the kernel takes the input blocks

327
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,600
and the requests coming in and orders those

328
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,600
and then actually ships them out physically to the disk

329
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,600
to go get written to disk through whatever firmware is involved with your fancy SSD.

330
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:40,500
eBPF is a handy new feature that you see in modern kernels that does bytecode.

331
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,500
So you get to write cool little programs that get loaded into the kernel

332
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,500
and the whole idea is to be able to instrument and get statistics

333
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,500
on all the things happening in the kernel.

334
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,500
Basically, think of it as the building block we needed

335
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,500
to have D-Trace-like functionality on Linux.

336
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,500
This case, Fred over at Circonus, which is a monitoring company,

337
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,500
well, he's always been curious, right?

338
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,500
What is the best IO scheduler?

339
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,400
Because you've got a couple options here.

340
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,400
You've got the completely fair scheduler.

341
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,400
There's deadline. There's no op.

342
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,400
There can be more options in general,

343
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,400
but those are the ones he's looking at here today.

344
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,400
There's got to be differences on your workloads, right?

345
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,400
So eBPF is something that you can use.

346
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,400
Circonus has their own monitoring agent,

347
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,400
so he installs that on some Ubuntu systems.

348
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,400
You wouldn't have to do that.

349
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,400
They just happen to have a fancy eBPF plug-in for it

350
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,400
because eBPF is the new hotness, right?

351
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,400
And that lets him make easy graphs.

352
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,300
He sends it up to their service, and he can make charts and stuff.

353
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,300
What's funny is that ends up biting him in the butt,

354
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,300
as you'll see later on.

355
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,300
But it is still a pretty handy feature,

356
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,300
and I think it shows that those sorts of functionalities

357
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,300
are now becoming common even in commercial products.

358
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,300
Yeah, so the real story here isn't really the results

359
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,300
that they got from the test

360
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,300
because it doesn't really tell us much, unfortunately.

361
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,300
But perhaps the real story is,

362
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,300
holy shit, eBPF is awesome,

363
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,300
and now we have this functionality built in

364
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,300
to the fricking Linux kernel.

365
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,200
People probably will be familiar with the Berkeley packet filter.

366
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,200
Super quick version.

367
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,200
How is this different than what the BSDs have

368
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,200
with the Berkeley packet filter?

369
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,200
What is eBPF, and why is it way better

370
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,200
and so cool that we have it in Linux?

371
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,200
Well, eBPF is extended BPF.

372
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,200
And really why it's neat is it's always been super helpful,

373
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,200
and it's something you can use to write little programs

374
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,200
to go catch network traffic.

375
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,200
So it's what you're using under the hoods

376
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,200
when you're using TCP dump.

377
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,100
You write your little TCP dump command line,

378
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,100
which is basically just a DSL for writing this stuff.

379
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,100
TCP dump under the hood compiles it into BPF,

380
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,100
into bytecode, and then runs it against the network traffic,

381
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,100
and then you can set up these really tight little routines

382
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,100
to match, like, oh, I don't know,

383
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,100
only UDP traffic on port 53, for example.

384
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,100
Yeah, and that bytecode is running inside the kernel

385
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,100
in a safe way.

386
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,100
It's incredible.

387
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,100
You can do a lot of fancy analysis to sort of prove,

388
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,100
you know, this won't loop forever

389
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,000
and other sort of escape analysis.

390
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,000
And what's neat about it is that it's extended

391
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,000
because it's not just for network stuff.

392
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,000
You can load it all over the kernel.

393
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,000
So you finally get access to a bunch of information

394
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,000
that you couldn't do without manually instrumenting

395
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,000
and recompiling your kernel before.

396
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,000
I think that's a really important point to make there.

397
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,000
It's not just about networking.

398
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,000
In fact, we did a deep dive in TechSnap.

399
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:19,000
Go to TechSnap.systems slash 388.

400
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,000
It's the one about eBPF.

401
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,000
It's like a super competitive game-changing feature

402
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,900
that's coming, well, it's arrived.

403
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,900
And it's so nice that there's really high-end hardware

404
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,900
being built around this functionality now.

405
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,900
And so it's not something that's probably on your radar,

406
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,900
but it's such a cool thing that Linux can do now,

407
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,900
and I really recommend you go check out that episode

408
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,900
of TechSnap.

409
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,900
But in the meantime, it appears it's getting easier

410
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,900
than ever for Linux workloads on Windows 10.

411
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,900
Now, the Windows subsystem for Linux

412
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,900
has been around for quite a while,

413
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,800
but it has one huge limitation.

414
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,800
And that is it's actually lacking a functional Linux kernel.

415
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,800
Now, of course, you could fire up an Ubuntu VM or a Debian VM

416
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,800
or what have you in Hyper-V.

417
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,800
But it's not quite as functional and as easy

418
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,800
to script and control as you would, say,

419
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,800
be able to fire up a VM on Linux.

420
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,800
That's where Canonical's multipass comes in,

421
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,700
which today is coming out of private beta.

422
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,700
And it looks pretty nice.

423
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,700
Oh, yes.

424
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,700
Multipass, at its core, is a service to manage Linux

425
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,700
and really, in this case, Ubuntu.

426
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,700
Linux, Ubuntu, they're virtual machines running on Windows 10

427
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,700
but without the overhead of having to deal with Hyper-V yourself.

428
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,700
Maybe, especially, I think, in our case,

429
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,700
if you are a Linux user who might just have to use Windows 10

430
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,700
for some reason, for whatever job or particular workflow,

431
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,700
but you still want your Linux.

432
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,600
I'm not an experienced Hyper-V administrator.

433
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,600
I respect it, but I don't know it very well.

434
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,600
So multipass is awesome.

435
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,600
Right.

436
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,600
It's sort of using Hyper-V as an implementation detail

437
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,600
to just get really fast VMs fired up on a Windows box

438
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:03,600
that you can now access and control from the command line.

439
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,600
And once they're launched,

440
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,600
a PowerShell user could fire off commands and scripts

441
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,600
at multipass and the VM itself,

442
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,600
including things that run inside the VM,

443
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,600
applications that should be loaded

444
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,500
and features that can allow you to scale up multiples of these

445
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,500
or reproduce VMs for development purposes.

446
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,500
Yeah, I mean, really, that's it right there.

447
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,500
David Chalmers, a product manager over at Canonical,

448
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,500
told The Register that that's exactly what multipass is aimed at,

449
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,500
developers in a corporate environment.

450
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,500
There's a lot of challenges to do.

451
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,500
It's not a good workflow normally, right?

452
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,500
You might have either a horrible command line experience

453
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,500
that doesn't have like a full kernel and it's sort of confusing

454
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,500
or you've got this full virtualized GUI,

455
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,400
which again is not what you want.

456
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,400
It's nice to see Linux everywhere, isn't it?

457
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,400
Like this is becoming the runtime.

458
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,400
This is becoming the runtime of the enterprise environment

459
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,400
and that's why this is important.

460
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,400
This isn't really at desktop Windows 10 users

461
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,400
that want to play Steam games.

462
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,400
This is designed for people in the corporate environment

463
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,400
that want to use Linux as sort of a runtime

464
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,400
that they can get everywhere.

465
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,400
And you have all kinds of options now on Windows.

466
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,400
It's sort of amazing.

467
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,400
You have the subsystem for Linux,

468
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,300
which gets you a pretty usable Linux environment.

469
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:20,300
Now you've got these easy optimized Hyper-V VMs

470
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,300
that are the graphical way to do this

471
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,300
where Microsoft has worked with upstream distribution creators

472
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,300
like Canonical to make an optimized environment for Hyper-V,

473
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,300
which gives you nice things like keyboard and mouse

474
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,300
and copy and paste integration and alt-tabbing in and out

475
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,300
amongst other things.

476
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,300
And if that's not your flavor,

477
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,200
you prefer to work on the command line and script

478
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:45,200
and shell script things, you've got multi-pass now.

479
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:51,200
And it really is a sort of what works best for you

480
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,200
kind of option on Windows.

481
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:58,200
In this weird way, Windows 10 gives you ubiquitous Linux.

482
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,200
You can have a window that has Ubuntu up,

483
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,200
that has OpenSUSE up, that has Fedora up

484
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,200
and is running multiple types of different virtual environments

485
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,200
all on Windows 10.

486
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,200
There's no excuse, right?

487
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,100
As a Windows user, you can have Linux

488
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,100
in all or some of the ways that you like.

489
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,100
We're looking at a kind of modularity here.

490
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,100
It's Linux modularity on Windows.

491
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,100
But what if this went even deeper?

492
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,100
What if this went to the core of Windows itself?

493
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,100
And that might just be what's happening

494
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,100
thanks to what may go down as one of history's

495
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,100
most ridiculous technology story leaks ever.

496
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,100
Think about this in context.

497
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,100
A massive story about Microsoft open sourcing

498
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,000
core components of Windows itself.

499
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,000
Windows itself.

500
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,000
What are you talking about?

501
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,000
What are you talking about?

502
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,000
That cannot be true.

503
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,000
I know.

504
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,000
And then, get ready for this part,

505
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,000
it gets leaked by some mid-level employee

506
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,000
who's just updating his LinkedIn profile

507
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,000
because that is apparently what has happened this week.

508
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,000
We've never talked about Windows core before.

509
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,000
It has been a rumor for a couple of years.

510
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,000
I have heard it kicked around for a couple of years now.

511
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,900
But we've never seen anything about it.

512
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,900
And LinkedIn is advertised as a place

513
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,900
where people can share their work experience,

514
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,900
find jobs, and mingle with their peers.

515
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,900
And it's also over and over again

516
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,900
a roundabout way to leak information

517
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,900
about what massive corporations are working on

518
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,900
because one Microsoft employee profile mentions

519
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,900
the quote, open source components in Windows core OS.

520
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,900
Yeah, the profile in question

521
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,800
is a security program manager tasked with managing quote unquote

522
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,800
the security of Windows core OS

523
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,800
from malicious actors and code.

524
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,800
Hmm, now that's a little confusing

525
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,800
since Windows core OS hasn't been announced yet.

526
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,800
And that is the exact name of rumors

527
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,800
that I have personally heard

528
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,800
from people that would be familiar with the matter.

529
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,800
So I'm a little confused

530
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,800
because they were just rumors that I was dismissing until now.

531
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,800
And that same security program manager then said quote

532
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,700
that he improved the security posture

533
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,700
of Windows open source components

534
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,700
through initiatives that investigate vulnerabilities

535
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,700
found and establish a process for redemption.

536
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,700
So if you connect the dots between the two

537
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,700
you have reason to suspect that the Windows core OS

538
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,700
is going to rely on some mysterious open source components

539
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,700
which essentially brings us to the story now.

540
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,700
Yeah, I mean there's been rumors about core OS

541
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,700
I think since 2017

542
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,600
essentially people are suspect anyway

543
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,600
that it's kind of the core of a modular version of Windows

544
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,600
customized for all kinds of devices.

545
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,600
Microsoft already tried something like that with Windows 10.

546
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,600
Remember Windows 10 mobile, Chris?

547
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,600
Yes, I do.

548
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,600
But Windows core OS seems to be purpose built

549
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,600
for more cross-platform, if anything.

550
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,600
What do you think of this, Wes?

551
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,600
I mean Windows core, could you imagine Windows core OS being free

552
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,600
and the next version of the

553
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,600
and even they speculate in this article over at Tom's Hardware

554
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,500
they speculate about the next version of Windows desktop

555
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,500
being based on this Windows core OS.

556
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,500
This lines up, right?

557
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,500
It does and it doesn't.

558
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,500
I think it lines up because we've seen huge moves by Microsoft

559
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,500
in the world of open source, right?

560
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,500
They clearly understand, at least in their modern tooling

561
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,500
that open source is useful

562
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,500
and they take advantage of it and contribute to it.

563
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,500
But we haven't really, excluding some of the.NET stuff

564
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,500
.NET Core and PowerShell

565
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,500
we haven't really seen any inroads into the world of Windows

566
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,400
and that's where the Windows branding on this makes it kind of stand out.

567
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,400
Yeah, I think it's also worth mentioning Visual Studio Code

568
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,400
has been pretty well received.

569
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,400
In fact, when you look at their open source project

570
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,400
remember they just recently released Azure Sphere

571
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,400
which is based on Linux.

572
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,400
They open sourced the old MS-DOS recently

573
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,400
TypeScript, WinForms,.NET Core

574
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,400
They keep writing all those little handy command line utilities for Linux?

575
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,400
There's a lot of little things that over the years

576
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,400
have been sort of adding up

577
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,300
and this Core nomenclature has been the direction they've been going

578
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,300
PowerShell Core,.NET Core, Core, Core, Core

579
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,300
I could possibly see it.

580
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,300
The reason why I don't get extremely excited about it

581
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,300
is simply because you know it wouldn't be GPL

582
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,300
and I don't mean to be that guy

583
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:18,300
but, you know, it's not going to change the world if it's not GPL

584
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,300
The GPL is that special kind of license that really made Linux grow

585
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,200
because when Samsung was contributing to the GPL

586
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,200
or was contributing code that was GPL

587
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,200
they had to also work with competitors at the same exact time

588
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,200
whereas if Linux wasn't GPL licensed

589
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,200
they could have just kept all those innovations for themselves

590
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,200
not necessarily shared them upstream if they didn't want to

591
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,200
and I don't know if we would have had the same success story

592
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:46,200
with say the Linux kernel on Android or etc.

593
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:50,200
Right, I think it's less of a really big philosophical moment

594
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,200
and probably just Microsoft being practical

595
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,100
Yeah, exactly, and it's still good

596
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,100
I don't mean to like diminish

597
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,100
Oh yeah

598
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,100
Yeah, but it's not like change humanity good

599
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,100
It's more like it's a practical kind of good

600
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,100
That all said

601
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,100
I kind of want to ask Brent this question

602
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,100
This is really out there

603
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,100
This is really out there

604
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,100
But let's just say we're 10 years down the road after this thing happened

605
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,100
If you could sit there and say

606
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,100
I can switch to Windows

607
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,000
and say it's Windows 15 or Windows 25 at this point

608
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:26,000
and it's got an open core

609
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,000
I can run an operating system with an open core

610
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,000
and I can use Adobe Photoshop

611
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,000
I can use Adobe Lightroom

612
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,000
I can use Adobe Premiere

613
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:38,000
But when I open up my file manager

614
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,000
when I browse the internals in my operating system

615
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,000
when I open up my web browser

616
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,000
that's all open source software

617
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,000
when I open up my text editor

618
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,000
that's open source software

619
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,000
It's just Windows open source software

620
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,900
Do you think that would be a compelling proposition to you?

621
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,900
I'm throwing in my mind

622
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,900
how is that different than the Linux I'm using currently

623
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,900
You can run proprietary software on the top

624
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,900
and all the base is mostly open

625
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,900
The only difference here might be that it's going to be Win32 compliant

626
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,900
It can run Windows traditional software

627
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,900
I suppose would be the major difference

628
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,900
That and the fact that it's a different type of license

629
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,900
Your Linux desktop is GPL software

630
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:21,800
where this might be BSD, Apache or some Microsoft license

631
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,800
Yeah, interesting

632
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:26,800
I think it would hit some of my

633
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,800
partly some of my ideals

634
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,800
I know the difference in GPL is huge

635
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,800
But for some people

636
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,800
simply the idea that they can have open source

637
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,800
and see it and modify it is enough

638
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,800
But I wonder

639
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,800
So maybe I'll throw a question back at you guys

640
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:50,700
What would be the advantage for some Linux users like us

641
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,700
to have simply an open source Windows

642
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,700
and how would that be any different

643
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,700
from a usability standpoint from what we have today

644
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,700
I don't think it is a net win

645
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,700
I don't know

646
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,700
I'm not fully convinced of this

647
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,700
LinuxUnplugged.com slash contact changed my mind

648
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,700
I feel like if it's not GPL

649
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,700
then it doesn't really stand the chance

650
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,600
of the long term infinite time scale

651
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,600
humanity scale kind of contribution

652
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,600
When we talk about Richard Stallman

653
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,600
and when he's talking about free software

654
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,600
I've never installed GNU slash Linux

655
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,600
He's talking about

656
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,600
He's talking about keeping something from humanity

657
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:33,600
He's talking about making software code

658
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,600
that is sustainable long term by humanity

659
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,600
versus something that is closed and proprietary

660
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,500
and that doesn't advance humanity

661
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,500
And when you think about it

662
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,500
in those larger long term contexts

663
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,500
I don't see the net positive of it

664
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,500
A GPL desktop with a full GPL software stack

665
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,500
could be around for a thousand years

666
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,500
But a commercial operating system

667
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,500
even if components of it are open source

668
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,500
much like Mac OS

669
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,500
is inherently tied to the commercial whims

670
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,500
and the ebbs and flows of

671
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,400
the United States stock market

672
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,400
It's not at the same scale

673
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,400
What do you think Wes?

674
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,400
I see what you mean

675
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,400
It's not going to take over the world in that way

676
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,400
It's sort of just incremental change

677
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,400
and it's nice to see

678
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,400
but probably we can all just stick to

679
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,400
our wonderful world of Linux

680
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,400
and our free and open source desktops

681
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,400
I find that interesting

682
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,400
It's nice to see

683
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,400
but doesn't really change that much does it?

684
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,300
It's kind of like something to talk about

685
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,300
but it doesn't really affect too much

686
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,300
Okay, well we should probably

687
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,300
we should probably stop at this point

688
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,300
because this is all just rumor

689
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,300
related to some LinkedIn stuff

690
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,300
but it just got us thinking about this kind of thing

691
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,300
You can never tell with modern Microsoft

692
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,300
It just makes you wonder

693
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,300
Right?

694
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,300
Where is it going to go next?

695
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,300
Like that is legitimately

696
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,300
what is at the core of the story

697
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,300
is at this point

698
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,300
I think we're ready for anything

699
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,200
in Windows core

700
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,200
and that even in itself really tells you something

701
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,200
Now, I think also

702
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,200
we could continue this conversation

703
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,200
into our next couple of major topics

704
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,200
including an application designer for Linux

705
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,200
as well as this whole S-storm

706
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,200
around MongoDB

707
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,200
which we've been covering pretty diligently

708
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,200
in Linux Action News

709
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,200
but I'll recap for you

710
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,200
in a wider context

711
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,200
that I think I'm a little concerned

712
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,200
could affect the fundamental funding

713
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,100
of future large scale open source projects

714
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,100
because it just seems like we'd come to a new normal

715
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,100
and now all of that's out the window

716
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,100
but I want to do a little housekeeping

717
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,100
because there's so many community events coming up

718
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,100
that I want to make sure we have one episode right here

719
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,100
where we really kind of bust through this stuff

720
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,100
All of what I'm about to tell you

721
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,100
will be linked up

722
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,100
at linuxunplug.com

723
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,100
slash 285

724
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,100
So let's bust through some of the things

725
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,100
that are coming down the road

726
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,100
First up, extremely proud

727
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:05,000
happy, thrilled, excited

728
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,000
to say that our

729
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,000
live audio stream

730
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,000
is now once again in working order

731
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,000
and sounding better than ever

732
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,000
jblive.fm

733
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,000
You can plug that into your mobile web browser

734
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,000
and it'll just start streaming

735
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,000
You can go into VLC, like open network

736
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,000
and plug in http://jblive.fm

737
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,000
Boom, enter

738
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,000
and you're now streaming our audio stream

739
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,000
And Wes has been working on some cool stuff on the droplet

740
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,000
to kind of like make it so that way

741
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,900
even when we're like at Linux Fest

742
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,900
or when Alan's streaming BSC Now

743
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,900
it's all up in there

744
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,900
Is there any open source in any of that

745
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,900
that you're doing?

746
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,900
Yeah, I mean, whatever we decide on

747
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,900
There's multiple interesting tools

748
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,900
They're all open source that we're using

749
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,900
It's kind of a hot race right now

750
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,900
between a couple to see

751
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,900
which will actually end up in production

752
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,900
The good news is they all work

753
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,900
They all sound great

754
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,900
And it means that if it's on jblive.tv

755
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,900
it'll be on jblive.fm

756
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,800
Yeah, and we

757
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,800
I'm just super happy with the way it sounds

758
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,800
We were very picky with where we went

759
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,800
and I think it sounds great

760
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,800
It took us a little bit to get there

761
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,800
But if you're on the road

762
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,800
and you know we're doing like Linux Unplugged

763
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,800
or something like that

764
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,800
just plug in jblive.fm and listen live

765
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,800
It's really nice

766
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,800
And also, just a little other bit of

767
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,800
network related housekeeping

768
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,800
I'm really very, very happy to announce

769
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,800
that Jim Salter has joined Mr. Wes Payne

770
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,700
as the full-time co-host for TechSnap

771
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,700
Oh, yeah

772
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,700
Yeah, you guys did

773
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,700
You just put out your first episode

774
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,700
Episode 395, TechSnap.Systems

775
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,700
Slash 395

776
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,700
All about Let's Encrypt

777
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,700
You guys do a deep dive

778
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,700
I love it

779
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,700
I love it, it was great

780
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,700
You know, yeah, Jim is great

781
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,700
I'm really excited for where this is going to go

782
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,700
because he has a lot of experience

783
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,700
a lot of knowledge

784
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,700
and some great stories

785
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,700
So expect a lot more from the TechSnap program

786
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,700
coming right up

787
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,700
Yeah, Jim's coming to Linux Fest too

788
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,700
so I'm excited to get to meet him in person

789
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,700
He's an author

790
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,600
He's a writer over at Ars Technica

791
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,600
He's been running Apache himself

792
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,600
on his own hosted systems

793
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,600
since FreeBSD 3.1

794
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,600
and he's been a fierce advocate

795
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,600
of free and open source software since then

796
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,600
and he's published some books

797
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,600
he's published some work

798
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:17,600
and, of course, you can read him on Ars Technica

799
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,600
and he covers everything from Wi-Fi

800
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,600
to NAS distributions

801
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,600
and next generation file systems

802
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,600
And our favorite, WireGuard

803
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,500
Yes, he's just like you and me

804
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,500
he's a big WireGuard fan

805
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,500
so I don't think we could have found a better co-host for you

806
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,500
and that first episode is out

807
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,500
and go check it out

808
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,500
TechSnap.Systems slash 395

809
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,500
go subscribe

810
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,500
because they're going to a new fortnightly schedule

811
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,500
so it's not too much

812
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,500
but when they do an episode

813
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,500
it's information dense

814
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,500
and I loved it

815
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,500
Alright, so I mentioned Linux Fest

816
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,500
You know, we're going to Linux Fest Northwest

817
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,500
LinuxFestNorthwest.org

818
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,400
It's April 26th through the 28th

819
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,400
although I don't really know what's going on on the 26th

820
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,400
26th is a Friday, right Wes?

821
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,400
Am I wrong on that?

822
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,400
But 26th is a Friday

823
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,400
No, you're absolutely

824
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,400
Normally it's like two days

825
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,400
this time it's three

826
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,400
so I'm not sure either

827
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,400
but I guess that means there's no reason

828
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,400
not to be in Bellingham on Friday

829
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,400
Does that mean we're supposed to be set up Thursday?

830
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,400
That fundamentally changes everything

831
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,400
You know, I suspect it's going to be just slightly more official

832
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,400
because in times past

833
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,400
they've had things like game nights on Friday

834
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,400
or other get-togethers

835
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,300
so it's probably just a little formalization of that

836
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,300
Yeah, it's going to be the 20th anniversary

837
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,300
of Linux Fest Northwest

838
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,300
and we have a huge Jupiter broadcasting crew

839
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,300
We have team members that you haven't even met yet

840
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,300
that we're still trying to get them on air

841
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,300
so you can meet them

842
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,300
We have, everybody really is coming

843
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,300
with pretty much the exception of Michael Dominic

844
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,300
from Koda Radio

845
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,300
Alan is going to make it

846
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,300
Jim Salter is going to make it

847
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,200
Popey and Wimpy are hoping

848
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,200
I think they're making it

849
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,200
I think they're like 95% locked in

850
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,200
Joe's going to be out here

851
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,200
Noah's going to be out here

852
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,200
Wes will be there

853
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,200
Angela will be there

854
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,200
It's going to be a huge

855
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,200
There's people I'm not even

856
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,200
because I could just sit here and go on and on

857
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,200
There's a huge crew coming

858
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:11,200
and we're going to have our Saturday evening

859
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,200
parking lot barbecue outside of Lady Jubes

860
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,200
Huge hit

861
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,200
I mean, how many people do you think were there last year, Wes?

862
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,200
Oh, I don't know

863
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,100
It was probably right around 50

864
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,100
and it was a great time

865
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,100
People were coming and going and hanging out

866
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,100
and there was always someone new to meet

867
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,100
someone friendly to hang out with

868
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,100
I suspect there'll be a Levi friend again this year too

869
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,100
You bet

870
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,100
You bet

871
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,100
Yeah, I've already talked to Emma at System 76

872
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,100
when you and I went out there to do the Thaleos coverage

873
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,100
We made sure we were on the same page

874
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,100
and we're going to do an even bigger cookout

875
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,100
We'll have multiple grills going

876
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,100
Lady Jubes will be there

877
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,000
Bring your drones

878
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,000
and bring a friend

879
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,000
and come hang out with us

880
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,000
I have the Meetup page up right now

881
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,000
You can find that at meetup.com

882
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,000
It'll also be linked in the show notes

883
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,000
Let us know if you're going to make it

884
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,000
We also have a Telegram group

885
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,000
that is now linked in the show notes for Linux Fest

886
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,000
So we have an official Linux Fest 2019

887
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,000
community Telegram group

888
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,000
linked in the show notes

889
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,000
as well as the Meetup

890
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,000
This stuff is getting official

891
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,000
We're getting excited

892
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,000
There's probably going to be several of your

893
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,900
broadcasting friends hosting talks

894
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,900
at Linux Fest this year

895
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,900
Definitely going to be a big show

896
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,900
Really encourage that you go to it

897
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,900
All the details are linked up in the show notes

898
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,900
Now, moving right along

899
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,900
Like I said, we've got a lot of community events

900
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,900
A couple of more to go over

901
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,900
At the Pasadena Convention Center

902
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,900
March 7th through the 10th, 2019

903
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,900
is Scale 17x

904
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,900
Again, we're going to be there

905
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,900
We won't have a booth necessarily

906
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,900
but we'll be at the event

907
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,900
One of our team members at least

908
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,800
Maybe more will be giving talks

909
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,800
I think both Wes and myself

910
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,800
I think, Wes, you want to go, Wes?

911
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:50,800
Yeah, why not?

912
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:51,800
Let's do it

913
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,800
Wes and I will be there

914
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,800
as well as another one of our team members

915
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,800
that you have yet to meet will be there

916
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,800
And it's going to be a great show

917
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,800
The convention center is beautiful

918
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,800
The location next to it has great places to eat

919
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,800
Always a great community at scale

920
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,800
So Jupiter Broadcasting is going again

921
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,800
March 7th through the 10th, 2019

922
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,800
at the Pasadena Convention Center

923
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,700
ScaleExpo.org

924
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,700
We have a link in the show notes

925
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,700
And we also have a telegram group

926
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,700
already set up for that

927
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,700
which is also linked in the show notes

928
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,700
I encourage you to participate

929
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,700
in these telegram groups

930
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,700
because this is really where you get

931
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,700
all of the information as it's developing

932
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,700
A lot of times we're at these events

933
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,700
and things change quick

934
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,700
And that telegram group is the most up-to-date spot

935
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,700
And now, last but not least

936
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,700
May 31st through June 1st

937
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,600
at the Irving Convention Center

938
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,600
right there by Dallas

939
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,600
Texas Linux Fest 2019

940
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,600
We will be there

941
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,600
And I'm very excited to say that again

942
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,600
Talks will be had

943
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,600
Meetups will be had

944
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,600
We will have a telegram group

945
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,600
All of that as it gets closer

946
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,600
We actually have a telegram group

947
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,600
JupiterBroadcasting.com slash Texas

948
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,600
for that one

949
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,600
And we'll do a meetup as it gets closer

950
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,600
And yeah, I don't know how many of us

951
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,600
are going to go there because it's in May

952
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,500
And we have Linux Fest in scale ahead of us

953
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,500
But a couple of us at least

954
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,500
will also be at Texas Linux Fest this year

955
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,500
So that's a lot of cool events, eh Wes?

956
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,500
Like, boom!

957
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,500
Oh my god, there's so much going on

958
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,500
So many great opportunities

959
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,500
to just meet people, hang out

960
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,500
and chat about our love for Linux

961
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,500
You know, we give time to these kinds of things

962
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,500
in the show because these events

963
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,500
build stronger connections in the community

964
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,500
And in a community where people are

965
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,500
dedicating their passion and their time

966
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,500
and they're scratching their own itch

967
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,400
to create software for other people

968
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,400
It is so fundamentally important to do that

969
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,400
It matters way more than it does

970
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,400
in other contexts

971
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,400
Like in the business world

972
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,400
there's this profit motive that forces

973
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,400
everybody to be fake nice to each other

974
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,400
and get along because

975
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,400
everybody wants to earn a buck

976
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,400
and nobody wants to take any big risk

977
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,400
or loss

978
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,400
But in the open source community

979
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,400
we don't have that fake pretext

980
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,400
that forces us to get along

981
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,400
People can be jerks to each other

982
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,400
and it's very counterproductive

983
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,300
But these events

984
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,300
and not just chatting with other people

985
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,300
even if you're anti-social

986
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,300
just going there and being around other people

987
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,300
that like the same things you like

988
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,300
or are giving you information

989
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,300
about things you need to know about

990
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,300
like through the talks and whatnot

991
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,300
It changes the game

992
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,300
And if you've never participated

993
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,300
in an event like this

994
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,300
it will take your passion for Linux

995
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,300
and open source up to an entirely new level

996
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,300
And if you haven't been in a year or so

997
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,300
it will re-energize you

998
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,300
That's why we talk about this

999
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,200
It does move the needle

1000
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,200
And one last thing in the show notes

1001
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,200
If you've ever considered

1002
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,200
maybe giving a talk

1003
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,200
but didn't know how to start

1004
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,200
didn't really have any resources

1005
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,200
for public speaking

1006
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,200
Go check the show notes again this week

1007
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:50,200
Linux Unplugged dot com slash 285

1008
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,200
Link in there to a Github

1009
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:55,200
that has so many great resources

1010
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,200
about getting started

1011
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,200
how to find a place to give a talk

1012
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,200
just figuring out the best idea

1013
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,100
how to write a CFP which is a call for papers

1014
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,100
how to handle that and submit it

1015
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,100
and write it in a way that's going to get accepted

1016
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,100
and then tools to use for your presentation

1017
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,100
I'm pretty sure you found this link, Wes

1018
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,100
and it's just a killer resource

1019
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,100
Yes, and that's because our little

1020
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,100
local homegrown conference, Seagull

1021
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,100
provides that link

1022
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,100
and I came across it when I did a talk

1023
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,100
for that last year

1024
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,100
and it really is helpful

1025
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,100
There's a ton of great things about

1026
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,100
how to understand who are you presenting for

1027
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,100
what should your talk be about

1028
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,000
and how do you get started?

1029
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,000
There you go

1030
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,000
I know it was a lot to go through

1031
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,000
in the housekeeping section

1032
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,000
and I know that some of these regional events

1033
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,000
aren't applicable to most of the people listening

1034
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,000
but I hope our enthusiasm for them

1035
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,000
at least encourages you to participate

1036
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,000
in the ones in your area

1037
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:49,000
or maybe go do a talk even

1038
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,000
I think we could use a lot more of that out there

1039
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,000
One last bit of housekeeping

1040
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,000
I was just doing

1041
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,000
I'm down here in Texas right now

1042
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,000
for a bunch of content releases

1043
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,900
I was co-hosting the live stream today

1044
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,900
and I had a chance to announce

1045
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,900
a new course that Linux Academy released

1046
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,900
called the Linux Operating System Fundamentals

1047
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,900
First of all, it's done by

1048
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,900
a training architect named Kenny

1049
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,900
He's a great guy

1050
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,900
He loves Linux

1051
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,900
but better than that

1052
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,900
he's got a great voice

1053
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,900
and he's got great production quality

1054
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,900
The reason why I wanted to mention this course

1055
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,900
and I'll have it linked in the show notes

1056
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,900
is it's about the Linux Operating System Fundamentals

1057
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,800
but a good 40% of the course

1058
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,800
I've taken it myself already this afternoon

1059
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,800
before we went on air

1060
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,800
is about the history of Linux

1061
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,800
and the history of the operating systems

1062
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,800
that existed before Linux

1063
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,800
and then what led to Linux

1064
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,800
and then also GNU

1065
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,800
and the Free Software Foundation

1066
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,800
and the Open Source Initiative

1067
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,800
and then the Linux distributions

1068
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:50,800
that came after that

1069
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,800
and the tail end of it

1070
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,800
is the uses of Linux

1071
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,700
that we have now today

1072
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,700
but I just didn't expect

1073
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,700
this great history of all this stuff

1074
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,700
and as somebody who's been using Linux

1075
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,700
since the 90s

1076
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,700
I have to say there's areas

1077
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,700
that being self-taught I missed

1078
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,700
and especially some of this history stuff

1079
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,700
I just really loved it

1080
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,700
so I'll put a link in the show notes

1081
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,700
Right, that's what's really hard

1082
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,700
when you are self-taught

1083
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,700
you don't learn that

1084
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,700
when you go read bash tutorials

1085
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,700
it doesn't tell you about

1086
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,700
where all this great software

1087
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,700
you're learning to use actually came from

1088
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,700
Yeah, it was great

1089
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,600
and if you're not a Linux Academy student

1090
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,600
they do have a seven day free trial

1091
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,600
I remember that from the ads

1092
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,600
I used to do for many years

1093
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,600
so you can sign it for free

1094
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,600
for seven days and take it

1095
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,600
but I was talking to Kenny about it

1096
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,600
when we were prepping for the stream

1097
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,600
and I was like, oh, I'm taking this

1098
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,600
and then I actually did take it earlier today

1099
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,600
because being in Texas

1100
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,600
I have two extra hours before the show

1101
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,600
so I'm like, what am I going to do?

1102
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,600
I'll take Kenny's course

1103
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,600
because it's like an hour and a half total

1104
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,600
and so I took it

1105
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,600
and he just has a great voice

1106
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,500
and he has a great production

1107
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,500
so anyways, good job to him

1108
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,500
and it was a good release

1109
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,500
and I'm hoping, by the way

1110
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,500
kind of related

1111
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,500
I'm hoping that Kenny makes it out

1112
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,500
to Linux Fest Northwest too

1113
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,500
so that's possible

1114
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,500
we could see him there

1115
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,500
Now, there's a lot of talk this week

1116
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,500
about a new design application

1117
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,500
for our beloved Linux

1118
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,500
something that's really missing

1119
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,500
the ability to sort of sketch out

1120
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,500
a general design for other applications

1121
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,400
and it's called, is it Arkea, Wes?

1122
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,400
Akira

1123
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,400
Akira, of course

1124
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,400
of course I missed it

1125
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,400
of course

1126
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,400
of course I missed it

1127
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,400
and do I have sort of the general premise right?

1128
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,400
It's like a sketch application

1129
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,400
for UI design?

1130
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,400
Yeah, yeah, exactly

1131
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,400
it's not something you're going to use

1132
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,400
to actually make actual interfaces

1133
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,400
it's for designers to play around with

1134
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,400
to mock up designs

1135
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,400
to ship to your client as an image

1136
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,400
to say, does this look about right?

1137
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,400
So Akira has been getting a lot of attention

1138
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,400
because this is an area

1139
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,400
that there's a lot of commercial solutions for

1140
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,300
including ones from Adobe and many others

1141
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,300
and there's not a lot of options

1142
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,300
for GNU slash Linux

1143
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,300
and Wes had a chance to sit down with Alex

1144
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,300
and talk to him about his Kickstarter

1145
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,300
that he's doing to try to raise money

1146
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,300
and to try to get people

1147
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,300
to develop for this thing full time

1148
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,300
it's a fascinating idea

1149
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,300
is there anything else we need to know

1150
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,300
before we listen to the interview, Wes?

1151
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,300
No, I don't think so

1152
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,300
Alex is the lead

1153
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,300
there's a broader team

1154
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,300
which he'll talk about

1155
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,300
Awesome, so here we are

1156
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,300
Welcome to the show, Alex

1157
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,200
and thank you for joining us today

1158
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,200
Thank you so much for having me

1159
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,200
it's a pleasure, absolutely

1160
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,200
Okay, well you're obviously here

1161
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,200
I mean, one, because you make a lot of good stuff

1162
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:30,200
actually I first saw your taxi application

1163
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,200
it's really pretty handy

1164
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,200
it's not what you're here to talk about today

1165
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,200
but it might come up again

1166
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,200
because you've got quite the background

1167
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,200
we're here to talk about Akira

1168
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,200
Yes, absolutely

1169
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:43,200
so just a little digression about taxis

1170
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:46,200
it's not 100% mine

1171
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,100
it's an old project that I took

1172
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,100
and I'm redeveloping

1173
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,100
and I'm refactoring and trying to update

1174
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,100
so I don't want to take all the credits for taxis

1175
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,100
it's not 100% mine

1176
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,100
but yes, I'm here to talk about Akira

1177
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,100
so I just launched a Kickstarter campaign

1178
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,100
for Akira

1179
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,100
or someone likes to call it Akira UX

1180
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:13,100
which is a UX design tool for Linux

1181
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,100
100% native for Linux

1182
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,000
it's not an electron app

1183
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,000
and UX design tools means

1184
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:21,000
that it's something similar to Sketch

1185
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,000
or Figma

1186
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,000
or Adobe XD

1187
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:27,000
that is not for creating GTK

1188
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,000
or Qt interfaces

1189
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,000
user interfaces like code

1190
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:34,000
is not made to speed out code

1191
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,000
That's a great point

1192
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,000
so it's not like something like Glade

1193
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,000
or Qt Creator

1194
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:39,000
it's not going to make a QXML file

1195
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,000
or anything like that for you

1196
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:43,000
so what formats are we talking about here?

1197
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,900
So basically, if I'm going to be a user

1198
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,900
what are we going to have as the output?

1199
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,900
Okay, the output

1200
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,900
the name probably is going to be

1201
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,900
like.Akira

1202
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:52,900
like a custom extension

1203
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,900
but it's just an SVG

1204
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,900
everything is going to be based on SVG

1205
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,900
we want to go the route of having a custom extension

1206
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,900
because we're going to try to save the file

1207
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,900
with a JSON format

1208
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,900
in order to have version control

1209
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,900
baked into your file

1210
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,900
that you can activate or deactivate

1211
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,800
based on your necessities

1212
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:16,800
so you can keep track of all the different versions of your file

1213
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:17,800
in the same file

1214
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,800
you don't have to have a dedicated repository

1215
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:21,800
or like the things that we used to do

1216
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:22,800
having version 1

1217
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:23,800
version 1 final

1218
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,800
version 1 final underscore reviewed

1219
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:26,800
version 1 final

1220
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,800
this is the actual final

1221
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,800
all this kind of good stuff

1222
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,800
when you do some design

1223
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:33,800
for a long time

1224
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,800
for a client that is never

1225
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,800
100% sure what to do

1226
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:38,800
That's fascinating

1227
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,700
obviously on the development side

1228
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,700
and you play in both these worlds

1229
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,700
on the development side version control goes back ages

1230
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,700
but I don't see it as often in the design community

1231
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,700
or at least not as standardized

1232
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,700
Exactly

1233
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,700
Sketch

1234
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,700
from like

1235
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,700
the Sketch app application

1236
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,700
that is currently only available on Mac OS

1237
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,700
has something like that

1238
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,700
but it's terrible

1239
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,700
because every time you save something

1240
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,700
like you move a square

1241
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,700
or you change one letter

1242
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,700
and you save the file

1243
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,600
it saves completely the entire file

1244
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:10,600
in itself

1245
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:12,600
so you end up with having a Sketch file

1246
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:15,600
that even if you have just one single artboard

1247
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:17,600
it waits for gigabytes

1248
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:18,600
Oh wow

1249
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:19,600
It's terrible

1250
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:20,600
yeah it's like

1251
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,600
it's really handy if you lose stuff

1252
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:23,600
and you can go back

1253
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,600
but there's no way of

1254
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,600
manually controlling what you can

1255
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:29,600
what you can save

1256
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,600
or if you want to pause

1257
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:33,600
the version control of this file

1258
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:34,600
and just like

1259
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,600
activate it only if you have some major release

1260
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,500
or stuff like that

1261
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,500
I'd say it's like

1262
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,500
it's the first approach

1263
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,500
of version controlling design

1264
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,500
but it's not that great

1265
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,500
That makes sense

1266
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,500
Okay well let's pivot back to Akira then

1267
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:46,500
and we were just starting to get there

1268
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,500
before I went down the other road

1269
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,500
of explaining just what you're targeting

1270
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,500
so you'll be outputting SVG

1271
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,500
so Akira is for designing interfaces

1272
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,500
and then producing vector images

1273
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,500
that you then might go share

1274
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,500
with the people downstream

1275
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,500
who actually built the thing

1276
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,500
Exactly

1277
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,500
It's mostly for designers

1278
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,500
which

1279
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,500
someone raised an eyebrows

1280
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,400
that oh why developers cannot use it

1281
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:08,400
why

1282
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,400
a lot of questions they were asked

1283
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,400
why Akira cannot generate code

1284
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,400
because we already have those things

1285
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,400
we already have those alternatives

1286
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,400
and those options

1287
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,400
something specifically targeting designers

1288
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,400
that they need to create

1289
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:22,400
just images

1290
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,400
they can share with developers

1291
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,400
or they can put

1292
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,400
online

1293
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,400
and create presentations

1294
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,400
or do some quick mockups

1295
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,400
and prototypes

1296
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,400
we don't have something like that

1297
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,300
right now on Linux

1298
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,300
Oh yeah right

1299
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,300
so maybe you can talk a little bit more

1300
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,300
because this is something

1301
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,300
you obviously know well

1302
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,300
as a professional

1303
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,300
and a Linux user

1304
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,300
can you talk a little bit about

1305
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,300
the pain of trying to have

1306
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,300
both of those things

1307
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,300
in today's world

1308
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,300
Oh my god it's terrible

1309
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,300
okay

1310
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,300
so feel free to interrupt me

1311
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,300
because I can go on forever

1312
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,300
I don't want to annoy everyone

1313
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,300
but I'm

1314
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,300
I've been doing development

1315
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,300
and design at the same time

1316
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,300
for more than 13 years

1317
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,300
professionally

1318
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,200
I was forced throughout my entire

1319
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,200
career to just use

1320
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:08,200
all Windows and Mac OS

1321
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:10,200
just because of applications

1322
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:12,200
I tried in

1323
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,200
digital studios

1324
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:14,200
or creative agencies

1325
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:15,200
that I worked in the past

1326
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,200
to go in and say

1327
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,200
hey let's not use Adobe

1328
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:19,200
let's use GIMP

1329
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,200
to do our photo retouching

1330
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,200
and everyone started laughing at me

1331
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:24,200
not because those tools

1332
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,200
like GIMP, Inkscape

1333
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,200
or Krita are bad tools

1334
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:29,200
those are amazing tools

1335
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:30,200
and they work great

1336
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:32,200
but the problem

1337
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,100
is the workflow

1338
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,100
is the user interface

1339
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,100
you can

1340
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,100
that's something that I always say

1341
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,100
you can do a square

1342
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,100
gray

1343
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,100
like a gray rectangle

1344
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,100
you can build a gray rectangle

1345
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,100
in Inkscape

1346
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,100
in GIMP, in Krita

1347
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,100
in Sketch, Figma

1348
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,100
it doesn't matter

1349
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,100
it will always be

1350
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,100
a gray rectangle

1351
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,100
but

1352
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,100
if you want to build

1353
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,100
a user interface

1354
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,100
with 20 different artboards

1355
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,100
and shared assets

1356
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,100
and design system

1357
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,100
and something that you can

1358
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:04,000
collaborate with other designers

1359
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:06,000
your options are really limited

1360
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,000
and there's nothing like that on Linux

1361
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:11,000
so it's all about

1362
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,000
optimizing the workflow

1363
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:14,000
of designers

1364
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,000
with a modern tool

1365
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,000
that offers a modern interface

1366
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,000
that's the main purpose

1367
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,000
so making Linux

1368
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:21,000
a habitable platform

1369
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:22,000
for designers

1370
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,000
so that someone

1371
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,000
you can have everything

1372
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,000
you can have your cake

1373
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:26,000
you can eat it too

1374
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,000
and design all your applications

1375
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,000
whether it's for another platform

1376
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:29,000
or for Linux natively

1377
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:30,000
absolutely

1378
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,900
and also the main purpose is

1379
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:32,900
helping Linux

1380
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:33,900
being like

1381
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:34,900
turning to a mainstream

1382
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:35,900
operating system

1383
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:36,900
that is not

1384
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,900
unfortunately for

1385
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,900
how we want to wish

1386
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:42,900
that this is the year

1387
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:43,900
of the Linux desktop

1388
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:44,900
it will never come

1389
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:45,900
if we don't have

1390
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,900
proper native

1391
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:48,900
alternative softwares

1392
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:49,900
that are

1393
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:50,900
comparable

1394
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:51,900
or even better

1395
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:52,900
than what are available

1396
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,900
on Windows and Mac OS

1397
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,900
and Akira wants to do that

1398
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:57,900
wants to say

1399
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:58,900
okay you don't want to use Sketch

1400
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,800
you don't want to pay

1401
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:01,800
$30 a month

1402
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:03,800
to use Adobe XD

1403
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:04,800
come on Linux

1404
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:05,800
we have exactly the same thing

1405
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:07,800
that works as well

1406
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:08,800
but it's open source

1407
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:09,800
it's free

1408
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,800
and we don't ask money for it

1409
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:12,800
so that's it

1410
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:13,800
so will Linux be

1411
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:14,800
the only targeted platform

1412
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:15,800
or will someday

1413
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:16,800
I will be able to run Akira

1414
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:17,800
on my MacBook

1415
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,800
that's a really good question

1416
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:20,800
for now

1417
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:21,800
it's 100% it's Linux

1418
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:22,800
because on MacBook

1419
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:23,800
or Windows

1420
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:24,800
you have

1421
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:25,800
20 different alternatives

1422
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,800
that can do the same

1423
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,700
but it's open source

1424
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,700
so if there's a crazy user

1425
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:31,700
out there

1426
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:32,700
that decides to compile

1427
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:33,700
and run GTK

1428
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:34,700
on Windows

1429
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,700
or Mac OS

1430
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:36,700
they can totally do it

1431
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,700
we're not opposed to that

1432
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:38,700
absolutely

1433
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,700
but it's not our goal

1434
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:41,700
okay well then

1435
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:42,700
while we're on this subject

1436
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,700
what about Linux distribution

1437
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:44,700
is it for all distributions

1438
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,700
I also happen to notice

1439
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,700
it looked like an older branch

1440
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:49,700
but a branch called

1441
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:50,700
AppImage on there

1442
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,700
so are there

1443
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:52,700
are there plans

1444
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:53,700
for these universal formats

1445
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:54,700
yes absolutely

1446
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,700
so by default

1447
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:56,700
we're going to start

1448
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,600
PPA

1449
00:49:58,700 --> 00:49:59,600
like on LaunchPod

1450
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,600
we're going to release

1451
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:01,600
daily builds

1452
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:02,600
so pretty much

1453
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:03,600
all the Debian based

1454
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:04,600
distribution

1455
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:05,600
will be able to install it

1456
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:06,600
then in the team

1457
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:08,600
we have

1458
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,600
Flatpak maintainer

1459
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:11,600
really great guy

1460
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:13,600
his name is Bilal

1461
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:14,600
we're going to be sure

1462
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:15,600
to release

1463
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:16,600
daily Flatpaks

1464
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:17,600
or like

1465
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:18,600
weekly Flatpaks

1466
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:20,600
installed everywhere

1467
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:21,600
it's going to be released

1468
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:22,600
on the elementary OS

1469
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:24,600
App Center

1470
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,500
and we're open to

1471
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,500
we don't have the

1472
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,500
skill level

1473
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:29,500
right now to do it

1474
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,500
but we're open

1475
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,500
to contribution

1476
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:32,500
to release also

1477
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,500
a SnapImage

1478
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,500
and an AppImage

1479
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,500
so a SnapPak

1480
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:37,500
and an AppImage

1481
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,500
perfect

1482
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,500
okay well

1483
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,500
that pretty well

1484
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,500
answers my question

1485
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:42,500
yeah we want to try to

1486
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,500
cover as many

1487
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,500
distributions as possible

1488
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,500
and

1489
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:46,500
that's also why

1490
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:47,500
we want to

1491
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,500
buy as much hardware

1492
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:49,500
as possible

1493
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:50,500
in order to test it

1494
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,500
and be sure that

1495
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,500
every single Linux users

1496
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,400
it doesn't matter the distribution

1497
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,400
it doesn't matter

1498
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,400
how modern

1499
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,400
and performant

1500
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,400
their laptop

1501
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,400
or computer is

1502
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:02,400
they can run Akira

1503
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:03,400
because

1504
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:04,400
yeah

1505
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,400
we want to be just

1506
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,400
available

1507
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,400
to anyone

1508
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:08,400
okay so you said

1509
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:09,400
we there

1510
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,400
and that's another thing

1511
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:11,400
we should talk about

1512
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,400
it's not just you working here

1513
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,400
it sounds like you've got

1514
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,400
a great team behind you

1515
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,400
yes

1516
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:16,400
I'm the crazy guy

1517
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,400
that decided to start

1518
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,400
this thing

1519
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:19,400
like a couple of years ago

1520
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:20,400
and I was like

1521
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:21,400
oh it's actually harder

1522
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,400
than I thought

1523
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,300
like everything

1524
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,300
so in the past year

1525
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,300
I started

1526
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,300
releasing

1527
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,300
native Linux applications

1528
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,300
like SQLer

1529
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,300
and taxi

1530
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,300
like you mentioned

1531
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,300
and throughout this year

1532
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,300
I started collaborating

1533
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,300
with a lot of

1534
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,300
different developers

1535
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,300
in particular

1536
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,300
I feel really comfortable

1537
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,300
and

1538
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,300
these are great people

1539
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:42,300
other three developers

1540
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,300
that they helped me a lot

1541
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,300
with my applications

1542
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,300
or

1543
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,300
I contribute to

1544
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,300
their own applications

1545
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,300
by

1546
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,300
offering design and development

1547
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,300
stuff like that

1548
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,300
the team is

1549
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,200
there's myself

1550
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:54,200
of course

1551
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,200
and then there's

1552
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:56,200
Felipe Escoto

1553
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:57,200
which is

1554
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:58,200
a Mexican developer

1555
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:00,200
for Elementor US

1556
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,200
he released

1557
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:03,200
SpiceUp

1558
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:04,200
and NodeTap

1559
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:05,200
two amazing applications

1560
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:06,200
oh yeah

1561
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:07,200
mind blown

1562
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:08,200
yeah and these

1563
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:09,200
it's a kid

1564
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,200
like this guy is

1565
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:11,200
20-ish something

1566
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,200
he's like the smartest kid

1567
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:13,200
I've ever met

1568
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,200
I feel like

1569
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:15,200
so old

1570
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:16,200
and so behind

1571
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,200
when I talk to him

1572
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,200
a wonder kid

1573
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,200
yeah a wonder kid

1574
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:20,200
absolutely

1575
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,100
and then there's

1576
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,100
Alberto Vangiole

1577
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,100
which is

1578
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,100
a software engineer

1579
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,100
Agnome Foundation member

1580
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,100
is the maintainer

1581
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,100
of GitG

1582
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,100
which is

1583
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,100
a visual

1584
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:33,100
Git repository manager

1585
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,100
and then we have Bilal

1586
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,100
and I always butcher

1587
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,100
his last name

1588
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,100
Elmousaoui

1589
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,100
sorry Bilal

1590
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,100
I apologize deeply

1591
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,100
he's a developer

1592
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,100
and is an

1593
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,100
Agnome Foundation member

1594
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,100
and

1595
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,100
he's an engineer

1596
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,100
student

1597
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,100
so it's like

1598
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,000
the smartest of the bunch probably

1599
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,000
and

1600
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:54,000
he's one of the maintainer

1601
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:55,000
of a lot of

1602
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:56,000
Flatpak

1603
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:57,000
applications

1604
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:58,000
so if

1605
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:59,000
FlatHab

1606
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:00,000
is a

1607
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:01,000
great repository

1608
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:03,000
it's mostly thanks to Bilal

1609
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,000
wow that is impressive

1610
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,000
clearly a lot of people

1611
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:06,000
who know what they're doing

1612
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,000
and have experienced

1613
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,000
building these kinds of

1614
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:09,000
applications before

1615
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:10,000
and maybe

1616
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,000
that explains my next question

1617
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:13,000
how far along

1618
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:14,000
is Akira

1619
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:15,000
what should users know

1620
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:16,000
is it ready for use

1621
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:17,000
is it

1622
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:18,000
just starting out

1623
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:18,900
where are you

1624
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,900
that's a really good question

1625
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:21,900
okay Akira

1626
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:22,900
there's a

1627
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:23,900
barely working prototype

1628
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:24,900
that you can

1629
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:25,900
download

1630
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:26,900
from the

1631
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:27,900
open source

1632
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:28,900
GitHub repository compile

1633
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,900
and run

1634
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,900
what we're missing

1635
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,900
is basically the core

1636
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:35,900
in order to

1637
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:36,900
be actually usable

1638
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:37,900
which is the hardest part

1639
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:38,900
is the canvas

1640
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:39,900
right now

1641
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:40,900
it doesn't exist

1642
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:41,900
a canvas library

1643
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:42,900
that does

1644
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:43,900
what we need

1645
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:44,900
it doesn't exist

1646
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:45,900
a canvas library

1647
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:46,900
that by default interacts

1648
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,800
with SVGs

1649
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:49,800
and

1650
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:50,800
whenever you create an object

1651
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:51,800
it creates

1652
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:52,800
separated layers

1653
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:53,800
that you can manipulate

1654
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:54,800
without

1655
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:55,800
having an issue

1656
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:56,800
oh I see

1657
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:57,800
right you need this

1658
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:58,800
sort of

1659
00:53:58,900 --> 00:53:59,800
rich environment

1660
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:00,800
the canvas to go interact

1661
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:01,800
so you can make shapes

1662
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:02,800
and drag them around

1663
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:03,800
and layer them

1664
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:04,800
and actually get the work done

1665
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:05,800
yeah right now

1666
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:06,800
it doesn't exist

1667
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:07,800
there are a lot of projects

1668
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:08,800
that they do that

1669
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:09,800
but are really limited

1670
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:10,800
or discontinued

1671
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:11,800
or

1672
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:12,800
it's all

1673
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,800
it's not a

1674
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:15,800
reusable library

1675
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,700
it's all like math based

1676
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:18,700
and it's C code

1677
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,700
there's nothing that

1678
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:20,700
we can simply

1679
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,700
grab and integrate

1680
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,700
inside Akira

1681
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:23,700
it's something

1682
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:24,700
that we need to create

1683
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:25,700
from scratch

1684
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,700
so yes

1685
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:27,700
the application

1686
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:28,700
is up and running

1687
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:29,700
it's a sort of like MVP version

1688
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:30,700
which

1689
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:31,700
comes with

1690
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,700
a built-in canvas

1691
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:34,700
that you can

1692
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,700
start to interact with

1693
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:36,700
but you cannot

1694
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:37,700
yet

1695
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:38,700
create shapes

1696
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:39,700
and save files

1697
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:40,700
and manipulate

1698
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:41,700
layers

1699
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:42,700
so

1700
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,700
the majority of the work

1701
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:45,600
is going to be about

1702
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:46,600
creating this canvas library

1703
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,600
which

1704
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:48,600
we want to make it available

1705
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:49,600
as

1706
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:50,600
like

1707
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:51,600
a package

1708
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:52,600
that everyone

1709
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:53,600
if they want to create their own

1710
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:54,600
mock-up

1711
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:55,600
design tool

1712
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:56,600
they can incorporate

1713
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:57,600
that library

1714
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:58,600
and reuse it

1715
00:54:58,700 --> 00:54:59,600
oh great

1716
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:00,600
so just sort of a spin-off project

1717
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:01,600
of here you go guys

1718
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:02,600
here's a great little canvas

1719
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:03,600
you can use

1720
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:04,600
yes exactly

1721
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:05,600
because it doesn't exist

1722
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:06,600
something like that

1723
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:07,600
so yes

1724
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:08,600
it's going to be used

1725
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:09,600
in Akira

1726
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:10,600
but it's going to be available

1727
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:11,600
to anyone

1728
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:12,600
that they want to incorporate

1729
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:13,600
in their own project

1730
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,500
of two to three months

1731
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,500
to release

1732
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,500
the first usable

1733
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,500
alpha version

1734
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:20,500
that

1735
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:21,500
I'm trying to push it

1736
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:22,500
and not being

1737
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:23,500
an alpha version

1738
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,500
but probably

1739
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,500
it's going to be an alpha version

1740
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,500
but version one

1741
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:27,500
is going to be available

1742
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,500
if the Kickstarter campaign

1743
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:30,500
is successful

1744
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:31,500
in three months

1745
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,500
after the end

1746
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:33,500
of the Kickstarter campaign

1747
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,500
well let's talk a little bit more

1748
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:35,500
about that

1749
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:36,500
you've got a Kickstarter campaign

1750
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,500
going on

1751
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,500
and I know

1752
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,500
our listeners

1753
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,500
are going to want to know

1754
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:41,500
what's the money

1755
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:42,500
going to be used for

1756
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:43,400
is there some

1757
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:44,400
corporate structure

1758
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:45,400
behind the scenes

1759
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,400
do you have plans

1760
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:47,400
for exactly where

1761
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:48,400
everything's going to go

1762
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,400
and how you'll use it

1763
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:50,400
tell us more

1764
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:51,400
yes absolutely

1765
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,400
so I

1766
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:53,400
in the Kickstarter

1767
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:54,400
description

1768
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:55,400
I wrote down

1769
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,400
a breakthrough

1770
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:57,400
of how

1771
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,400
all the money

1772
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,400
will be used

1773
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:00,400
because

1774
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:01,400
honestly I'm asking

1775
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,400
for a lot of money

1776
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:03,400
it is

1777
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:04,400
totally 65,000

1778
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:05,400
Canadian dollars

1779
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,400
which

1780
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,400
roughly translate

1781
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:08,400
to fifty thousand

1782
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,400
US dollars

1783
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:10,400
and

1784
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:11,400
a lot of people

1785
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,300
thirty percent will go in taxes

1786
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:14,300
because

1787
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,300
I'm not a corporation

1788
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,300
we didn't

1789
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,300
create a foundation

1790
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,300
on anything like that

1791
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:20,300
on a non-profit

1792
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,300
I'm just like

1793
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:22,300
a single user

1794
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,300
so

1795
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,300
that money

1796
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,300
will be

1797
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,300
for the Canadian government

1798
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,300
is like

1799
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,300
income

1800
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,300
and I have to declare taxes

1801
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,300
on that income

1802
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,300
and I have to pay

1803
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,300
thirty percent

1804
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,300
ish

1805
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,300
that money

1806
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,300
so already thirty percent

1807
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,300
is gone forever

1808
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,300
burned

1809
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,300
and gave it to the government

1810
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,300
but it's fine

1811
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,300
then

1812
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:41,200
two thousand dollars

1813
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:42,200
will be used

1814
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:43,200
to hire

1815
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:44,200
these three developers

1816
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:45,200
for three months

1817
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:46,200
that's the main purpose

1818
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:47,200
I want to

1819
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:48,200
pay them

1820
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:49,200
as a full-time job

1821
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:51,200
so they can work on this

1822
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:52,200
eight hours per day

1823
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:53,200
five days a week

1824
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:54,200
for three months

1825
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:55,200
non-stop

1826
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:56,200
is the only way

1827
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:57,200
we can

1828
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:58,200
be able to deliver

1829
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:59,200
something like that

1830
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:00,200
they cannot work

1831
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:01,200
part-time

1832
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:02,200
one hour per day

1833
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:03,200
or during the weekend

1834
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,200
right

1835
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:05,200
they need time to focus

1836
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:06,200
if you're going to get

1837
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:07,200
good quality work out quickly

1838
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,200
absolutely

1839
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:09,200
so I asked them

1840
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,100
I'm going to cover

1841
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,100
the entire rate

1842
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,100
and then we have an extra

1843
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,100
twenty thousand dollars

1844
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,100
which

1845
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,100
ten thousand

1846
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,100
will be

1847
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,100
to pay

1848
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,100
my

1849
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,100
paycheck basically

1850
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,100
and

1851
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,100
sustain myself

1852
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,100
for three months

1853
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,100
so I don't need to

1854
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,100
I can take

1855
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,100
some three months

1856
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,100
off of work

1857
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,100
and I need to work

1858
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,100
I can focus on Akira

1859
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,100
a hundred percent as well

1860
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,100
and the rest of the

1861
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,100
ten thousand dollars

1862
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,100
will be used

1863
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,100
to buy

1864
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,100
hardware

1865
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,100
because

1866
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,100
yes every one of us

1867
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,100
has a laptop

1868
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,100
but we just have

1869
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:39,000
a laptop that it's

1870
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:40,000
probably not the best

1871
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:41,000
we don't have

1872
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:42,000
graphic tablets

1873
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:43,000
we don't have

1874
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:44,000
4k monitors

1875
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:45,000
we don't have

1876
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:46,000
touch

1877
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:47,000
touchpad interfaces

1878
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,000
and all this kind of stuff

1879
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:49,000
that

1880
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,000
are

1881
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,000
standard

1882
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:52,000
in

1883
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:53,000
a professional

1884
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:54,000
design world

1885
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:55,000
when you work in an agency

1886
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:56,000
it's normal

1887
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:57,000
having a 4k

1888
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:58,000
or 5k monitor

1889
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,000
it's normal

1890
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,000
having

1891
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,000
a Wacom tablet

1892
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:02,000
with a digital display

1893
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:03,000
how good

1894
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:04,000
are

1895
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:05,000
those things currently

1896
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:06,000
working

1897
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:07,000
on Linux

1898
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,900
not that great

1899
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:09,900
they work

1900
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:10,900
but

1901
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:11,900
they're not the best

1902
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:12,900
so

1903
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:13,900
having the ability

1904
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:14,900
to purchase

1905
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:15,900
that hardware

1906
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:16,900
and

1907
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:17,900
develop Akira

1908
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:18,900
since day one

1909
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:19,900
on

1910
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:20,900
that

1911
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:21,900
different hardware

1912
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:22,900
all those

1913
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:23,900
different resolutions

1914
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:24,900
and different

1915
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:25,900
input interfaces

1916
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:26,900
will give us

1917
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:27,900
the ability to

1918
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,900
release Akira

1919
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:30,900
working

1920
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:31,900
in every

1921
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:32,900
single environment

1922
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:33,900
possible

1923
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:34,900
right you won't have to just

1924
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:35,900
try to retrofit

1925
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:36,800
it literally on down

1926
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:37,800
down the stream later

1927
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:38,800
you're going to be planning for it

1928
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:39,800
because you know professionals

1929
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:40,800
want to use it

1930
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:41,800
exactly and

1931
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:42,800
how many times

1932
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:43,800
you use a project

1933
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:44,800
and you go into

1934
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:45,800
their repositories

1935
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:46,800
and there are issues like

1936
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:47,800
this doesn't work

1937
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:48,800
with my

1938
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:49,800
tablet

1939
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:50,800
or this

1940
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:51,800
doesn't work with my laptop

1941
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:52,800
because I have this resolution

1942
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:53,800
and the answer is

1943
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:54,800
sometimes

1944
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:55,800
I'm sorry

1945
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:56,800
I cannot test it

1946
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:57,800
because I don't have

1947
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:58,800
that hardware

1948
00:58:58,900 --> 00:58:59,800
right yeah exactly

1949
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:00,800
yeah we want to try to avoid that

1950
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:01,800
it's like

1951
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:02,800
no we cannot fix it

1952
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:03,800
because we don't know

1953
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:04,800
how to recreate the issue

1954
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:05,700
so

1955
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,700
that's the main thing

1956
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,700
yeah on the Kickstarter page

1957
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:10,700
there's a full breakdown

1958
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:11,700
of everything

1959
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:12,700
percentages

1960
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:13,700
all the money

1961
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:14,700
and

1962
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:15,700
a lot of users

1963
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:16,700
were kind of like

1964
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,700
weirded out

1965
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:19,700
by the amount

1966
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:20,700
and

1967
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:21,700
the fact that I actually

1968
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:22,700
wrote down the money

1969
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:23,700
they didn't believe that

1970
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:24,700
30% goes in taxes

1971
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:25,700
or

1972
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:26,700
some didn't believe

1973
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:27,700
oh ten thousand dollars

1974
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:28,700
for

1975
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:29,700
your rent and your food

1976
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:30,700
and I'm like yeah

1977
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:31,700
I have to eat

1978
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:32,700
for three months

1979
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,700
but

1980
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:35,600
I want to reiterate the fact that

1981
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:36,600
I'm not trying to

1982
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:37,600
get rich

1983
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:38,600
or

1984
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:39,600
buy a Tesla

1985
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:40,600
or

1986
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:41,600
I don't know

1987
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:42,600
get a bunch of money

1988
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:43,600
and then disappear

1989
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:45,600
I really want

1990
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:47,600
to make this happen

1991
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:49,600
because it's literally

1992
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:50,600
the only thing

1993
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:52,600
that it's preventing me

1994
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:54,600
from using Linux

1995
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:55,600
every day

1996
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:57,600
I have one MacBook

1997
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:58,600
left in my apartment

1998
00:59:58,700 --> 00:59:59,600
just because

1999
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:00,600
of one application

2000
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:02,600
the design application

2001
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:03,500
that I have to use

2002
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,500
Wow okay Linux users

2003
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:05,500
out there

2004
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:06,500
if you weren't going to fund the Kickstarter

2005
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:07,500
because you're not going to use

2006
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:08,500
Zekira

2007
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:09,500
you're not a designer

2008
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:10,500
I think that's a pretty good reason

2009
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:11,500
right there

2010
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:12,500
get you

2011
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:13,500
get you Alex

2012
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:14,500
right off that MacBook

2013
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,500
help me

2014
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:17,500
yeah that's it

2015
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:18,500
and you know

2016
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:19,500
I mean to just put it

2017
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:20,500
in a little perspective

2018
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:21,500
if you think about

2019
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:22,500
you know several developers

2020
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:23,500
working for

2021
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:24,500
a significant part of a year

2022
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:25,500
at like a major

2023
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:26,500
development company

2024
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:27,500
well that's going to be

2025
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:28,500
a lot more money

2026
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:29,500
than you're asking for

2027
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:30,500
yeah exactly

2028
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:31,500
I'm not paying benefits

2029
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:32,400
to them

2030
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:33,400
I'm not paying

2031
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:34,400
paid vacations

2032
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:35,400
or something like that

2033
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:36,400
so the cost is really

2034
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,400
is really limited

2035
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:38,400
compared to

2036
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:39,400
what you're going to get paid

2037
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,400
if you work on a full-time job

2038
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:42,400
on an actual

2039
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,400
company but

2040
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:45,400
yeah that's

2041
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:46,400
that's the amount of money

2042
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:47,400
I wanted to be

2043
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:48,400
as honest and clear

2044
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:49,400
as possible

2045
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:50,400
I put the full breakdown

2046
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:52,400
of how I'm going to use the money

2047
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:53,400
and also my wife

2048
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:54,400
told me like

2049
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:55,400
you shouldn't do that

2050
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:56,400
because a lot of people

2051
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:57,400
will question you

2052
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:58,400
and will start like

2053
01:00:58,500 --> 01:00:59,400
having doubts

2054
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:00,400
of what you wrote

2055
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,300
it's

2056
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,300
I want to be

2057
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,300
open source

2058
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:04,300
also with the money

2059
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,300
so if we reach the goal

2060
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,300
I'm going to

2061
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,300
constantly do weekly updates

2062
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:10,300
of how I'm going to

2063
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,300
spend the money

2064
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,300
where the money will go

2065
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,300
and of course

2066
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,300
if I end up

2067
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:15,300
not spending all those

2068
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:16,300
all the money

2069
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,300
in taxes

2070
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:18,300
or I can use the

2071
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,300
accountant

2072
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:20,300
to help me out

2073
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,300
to save something

2074
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:22,300
all the money

2075
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,300
that I have left

2076
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:24,300
will be funneled back

2077
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,300
inside

2078
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,300
the application itself

2079
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,300
I'm going to

2080
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:28,300
we're going to set up

2081
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,200
some bounty sources

2082
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:31,200
to help other developers

2083
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:32,200
that want to

2084
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:33,200
contribute to get paid

2085
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:34,200
in order to work on Akira

2086
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:35,200
so

2087
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:36,200
it's not

2088
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:37,200
yeah it's not to

2089
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:38,200
get rich

2090
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:39,200
or

2091
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:40,200
take some time off work

2092
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:41,200
and go on vacation

2093
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:42,200
that's not the goal

2094
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:43,200
that makes sense

2095
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:45,200
I certainly wish you luck

2096
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:46,200
I've actually already

2097
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:47,200
backed it

2098
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:48,200
so I hope it goes through

2099
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:49,200
yeah

2100
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:50,200
and we'll have links

2101
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:51,200
to everything we've talked about

2102
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:52,200
in this interview

2103
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:53,200
in the show notes

2104
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:54,200
is there anything else

2105
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:55,200
you want the audience to know?

2106
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:56,200
just one thing

2107
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:59,100
everyone probably

2108
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,100
the majority of the audience

2109
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,100
is on Linux

2110
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,100
and

2111
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,100
in our entire life

2112
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,100
we always

2113
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,100
found ourselves

2114
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,100
using an application

2115
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,100
and thinking

2116
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,100
oh this is great

2117
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,100
but it doesn't do

2118
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,100
what I actually want

2119
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,100
Akira wants to fill that gap

2120
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,100
Akira

2121
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,100
we want to

2122
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,100
give you the freedom

2123
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,100
of saying

2124
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,100
I'm on Linux

2125
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:21,100
and I don't need

2126
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,100
anything else

2127
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,100
I don't want Adobe

2128
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,100
to

2129
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:25,100
create a port

2130
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:26,000
for Linux

2131
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:27,000
of the Adobe creative suite

2132
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:28,000
because

2133
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:29,000
I don't need it

2134
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:30,000
I'm fine with this

2135
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:31,000
that's our goal

2136
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:33,000
professional caliber

2137
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:35,000
Linux design application

2138
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:36,000
that could be

2139
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:37,000
the future of Akira

2140
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:38,000
yes

2141
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:39,000
where should people go

2142
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:40,000
to find more from you Alex?

2143
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:41,000
yes

2144
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:42,000
there's my Twitter account

2145
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:43,000
which is

2146
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:44,000
at alecad

2147
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:45,000
ddd

2148
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:46,000
with 3d

2149
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:47,000
and then

2150
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:48,000
I'm on YouTube

2151
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:49,000
I do actually

2152
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:50,000
tutorials about Linux

2153
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,000
design and development

2154
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,000
because

2155
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:53,000
I

2156
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:54,000
don't like to sleep

2157
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:54,900
but it's fine

2158
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:55,900
and

2159
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:56,900
that's it

2160
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:57,900
pretty much

2161
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:58,900
I'm everywhere online

2162
01:02:59,000 --> 01:02:59,900
so people start

2163
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:00,900
getting really

2164
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:01,900
really annoyed

2165
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:02,900
by my

2166
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:03,900
online presence

2167
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:04,900
perfect

2168
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:05,900
well thank you so much

2169
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:06,900
for joining us

2170
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:07,900
and good luck

2171
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:08,900
awesome

2172
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:09,900
thank you so much for having me

2173
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:10,900
such a great idea

2174
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:11,900
and I like how

2175
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:12,900
much Alex

2176
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:13,900
has this together

2177
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:14,900
he's got a real

2178
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:15,900
plan of attack here

2179
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:16,900
and

2180
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:17,900
as Linux users

2181
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:18,900
we're often in this position

2182
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:19,900
of trying to decide

2183
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:20,900
do I want to take a risk

2184
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:21,900
on funding

2185
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:22,900
this thing

2186
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:23,800
although I know

2187
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:24,800
that this is something

2188
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:25,800
we really need

2189
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:26,800
it's good

2190
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:27,800
it's good to hear Alex

2191
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:28,800
really seems to have it

2192
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:29,800
we've debated a lot of

2193
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:30,800
kind of questionable

2194
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:31,800
kickstarters

2195
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:32,800
over the years on this show

2196
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:33,800
I don't think this is one of them

2197
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:34,800
no

2198
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:35,800
no you seem like

2199
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:36,800
you had it figured out

2200
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:37,800
so

2201
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:38,800
I'm really glad

2202
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:39,800
you had a chance to chat with him

2203
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:40,800
and

2204
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:41,800
we'll have a link

2205
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:42,800
to their fundraiser

2206
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:43,800
in the show notes

2207
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:44,800
probably worth doing

2208
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:45,800
if you're a developer

2209
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:46,800
because I think

2210
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:47,800
it would be an investment

2211
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:48,800
in a possible workflow

2212
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:49,800
and I like that

2213
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:50,800
he's thinking about

2214
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:51,800
multi distro packaging too

2215
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,700
I think that's a good thing

2216
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,700
I'm looking at our time here

2217
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:56,700
and I'm thinking

2218
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:57,700
we're going to have to wait

2219
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,700
on the Ubuntu 19.04

2220
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:00,700
first look

2221
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:01,700
I've been running it now

2222
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:02,700
since

2223
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:03,700
pretty much

2224
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:04,700
since our predictions episode

2225
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:05,700
but you won't talk about it

2226
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:06,700
I keep asking you

2227
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:07,700
off air

2228
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:08,700
you say no

2229
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:09,700
no Wes

2230
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:10,700
I'm going to tell you on air

2231
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:11,700
and once again

2232
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:12,700
no

2233
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:13,700
I guess it's kind of good

2234
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:14,700
it gives me more time

2235
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:15,700
I just

2236
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:16,700
I feel like by the time

2237
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:17,700
we finally get around to this

2238
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:18,700
it's going to be

2239
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:19,700
just near release time

2240
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:20,700
I just wanted to give a first look

2241
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:21,600
at what's coming down the road

2242
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:22,600
for GNOME

2243
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:23,600
it's

2244
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:24,600
it's

2245
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:25,600
for those of us

2246
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:26,600
that have had

2247
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:27,600
GNOME problems

2248
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:28,600
there's a lot of good stuff

2249
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:29,600
in the works

2250
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:30,600
so we'll talk about that

2251
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:31,600
in the future

2252
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:32,600
but I wanted

2253
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:33,600
while it's still fresh

2254
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:34,600
I want to take a moment

2255
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:35,600
and wrap up the show

2256
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:36,600
with this

2257
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:37,600
interesting challenge

2258
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:38,600
that

2259
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:39,600
I think is facing

2260
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:40,600
open source software

2261
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:41,600
and I think what we'll do

2262
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:42,600
is

2263
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:43,600
we'll open it

2264
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:44,600
and if we

2265
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:45,600
if we get some good responses

2266
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:46,600
we'll conclude it

2267
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:47,600
next week

2268
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:48,600
and

2269
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:49,600
if you followed

2270
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:50,500
me on Twitter

2271
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:51,500
you know that recently

2272
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:52,500
MongoDB

2273
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:53,500
went through

2274
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:54,500
a series of changes

2275
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:55,500
in attempt to

2276
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,500
relicense in a way

2277
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:57,500
that

2278
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:58,500
that forced

2279
01:04:58,600 --> 01:04:59,500
providers that are

2280
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:00,500
re-hosting MongoDB

2281
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:01,500
to have to pay

2282
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:02,500
a certain fee

2283
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:03,500
get a certain kind of

2284
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:04,500
relationship with MongoDB

2285
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,500
and it's resulted

2286
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,500
in

2287
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:08,500
Red Hat

2288
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:09,500
and Fedora

2289
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:10,500
and Debian

2290
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:11,500
and other distributions

2291
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,500
deciding to no longer

2292
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:13,500
include MongoDB

2293
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:14,500
in the repositories

2294
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:15,500
because they believe

2295
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:16,500
that license conflicts

2296
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:17,500
with free software

2297
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:18,500
and

2298
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:19,400
at the same time

2299
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:21,400
another shoe has dropped

2300
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:22,400
and that is that

2301
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:23,400
Amazon has released

2302
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:24,400
AWS

2303
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:25,400
DocumentDB

2304
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:26,400
which is a straight up

2305
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:28,400
competitor to MongoDB

2306
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:29,400
and even

2307
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:30,400
implements

2308
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:31,400
compatibility with

2309
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:32,400
MongoDB's

2310
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:33,400
MongoDB's

2311
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:34,400
API

2312
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:35,400
from the

2313
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:36,400
version right before

2314
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:37,400
they made the licensing

2315
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:38,400
changes

2316
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:39,400
I have all that right so far

2317
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:40,400
right Wes?

2318
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:41,400
Yeah I mean

2319
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:42,400
it's not just MongoDB

2320
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:43,400
Redis, Kafka

2321
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:44,400
there's been kind of

2322
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:45,400
a long line of projects

2323
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:46,400
that are

2324
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:47,400
you know came

2325
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:48,300
from companies

2326
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:49,300
that were all

2327
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,300
all in on this

2328
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:51,300
they had this open source

2329
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:52,300
product kind of

2330
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,300
freemium right

2331
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:54,300
trying to sell

2332
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,300
additional enterprise

2333
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:56,300
services or different

2334
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:57,300
licenses on top

2335
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,300
it kind of varies

2336
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,300
from company to company

2337
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:00,300
and then

2338
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:01,300
well the cloud behemoths

2339
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:02,300
came into the room

2340
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,300
and it turns out

2341
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:04,300
everyone wants them

2342
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:05,300
to run the software

2343
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:06,300
for them so

2344
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,300
how do you make money?

2345
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:08,300
Great idea

2346
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,300
but now running at scale

2347
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:10,300
is sort of what's happening

2348
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,300
oh that open source project

2349
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:12,300
there

2350
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,300
great idea

2351
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:14,300
now let's just take that

2352
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:15,300
and implement it

2353
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:16,300
on our own systems

2354
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:17,200
and really

2355
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:18,200
Microsoft kind of

2356
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:19,200
did this first

2357
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:20,200
with their Cosmos DB

2358
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:21,200
over on Azure

2359
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:22,200
it just

2360
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:23,200
didn't quite get

2361
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:24,200
the same attention

2362
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:25,200
that AWS's DocumentDB

2363
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:26,200
did

2364
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:27,200
but they kind of

2365
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:28,200
just straight up

2366
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:29,200
did the same thing

2367
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:30,200
did a MongoDB competitor

2368
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:31,200
that's now an Azure branded

2369
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:32,200
service that you pay for

2370
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:33,200
and what they're selling

2371
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:34,200
isn't the software

2372
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:35,200
what they're selling

2373
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:36,200
is the reliability

2374
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:37,200
and the infrastructure

2375
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:38,200
of AWS

2376
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:39,200
or Azure

2377
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:40,200
in this case

2378
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:41,200
and

2379
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:42,200
this is

2380
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:43,200
I think

2381
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:45,200
a huge threat

2382
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,100
to open source software

2383
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:47,100
not because

2384
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,100
these large commercial

2385
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,100
companies

2386
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,100
are taking

2387
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:51,100
open source software

2388
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:52,100
and

2389
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:53,100
re-implementing it

2390
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,100
or even just

2391
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:55,100
re-hosting it in some cases

2392
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:56,100
and then calling it

2393
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:57,100
their own service

2394
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:58,100
and charging for it

2395
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:59,100
like that's

2396
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,100
that's going to happen

2397
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:01,100
but

2398
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,100
in a much

2399
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:03,100
much

2400
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,100
bigger picture way

2401
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,100
it could fundamentally

2402
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,100
undermine

2403
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:07,100
how open source projects

2404
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:08,100
that need to build

2405
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:09,100
at a certain scale

2406
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,100
get funded

2407
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,100
kickstarters

2408
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:13,100
don't build MongoDB

2409
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,100
patreons

2410
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:16,000
don't build MongoDB

2411
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:17,000
large

2412
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:18,000
corporate

2413
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:19,000
VC backed

2414
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:20,000
funding

2415
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:21,000
builds things

2416
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:22,000
that are at that scale

2417
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:23,000
it's just the nature

2418
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:24,000
of the software industry

2419
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:25,000
and I want to

2420
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:26,000
play a clip

2421
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:27,000
from Ben Thompson

2422
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:28,000
who in his

2423
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:29,000
podcast

2424
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:30,000
Exponent

2425
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:31,000
which we will link

2426
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:32,000
in the show notes

2427
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:33,000
he's talked about this

2428
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:34,000
and written

2429
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:35,000
we'll link to this

2430
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:36,000
in the show notes

2431
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:37,000
I want to play this

2432
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:38,000
and then Wes and I

2433
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:39,000
are going to chat

2434
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:40,000
about it a little bit

2435
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:41,000
and then

2436
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:42,000
I'm going to leave it

2437
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:43,000
to the audience

2438
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:43,900
in the podcast

2439
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:44,900
where he talks about

2440
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:45,900
this VC funding issue

2441
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:46,900
this is

2442
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:47,900
driving a lot of angst

2443
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:48,900
sort of in the open source

2444
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:49,900
world

2445
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:50,900
which is

2446
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:51,900
we kind of got this

2447
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:52,900
cool new model

2448
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:53,900
where

2449
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:54,900
open source projects

2450
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:55,900
could

2451
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:56,900
not just be

2452
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:57,900
sort of developed

2453
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:58,900
by hobbyists

2454
01:07:59,000 --> 01:07:59,900
or people in their free time

2455
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:00,900
or

2456
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:01,900
people supported by

2457
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:02,900
foundations

2458
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:03,900
or grants

2459
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:04,900
or whatever it might be

2460
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:05,900
but actually

2461
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:06,900
like

2462
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:07,900
getting VC money

2463
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:08,900
and VC makes

2464
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:09,900
so much sense for software

2465
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:10,900
because

2466
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:11,900
software is a lot of work

2467
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:12,800
and tools

2468
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:13,800
and if Amazon's coming along

2469
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:14,800
and basically leveraging

2470
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:16,800
their massive scale

2471
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:18,800
and what they're selling

2472
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:19,800
to enterprises

2473
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:20,800
which is

2474
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:21,800
the sort of

2475
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:22,800
reliability

2476
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:23,800
and scalability

2477
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:24,800
and all those things

2478
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:25,800
that Amazon offers

2479
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:26,800
is that business model

2480
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:27,800
going where

2481
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:28,800
are we losing

2482
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:29,800
what seemed to be

2483
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:30,800
a workable business model

2484
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:31,800
for open source

2485
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:32,800
and that'd be a bummer

2486
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:33,800
frankly

2487
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:34,800
it'd be a bummer for everyone

2488
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:35,800
it'd be a bummer for Amazon

2489
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:36,800
huge bummer

2490
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:37,800
I mean here's the concern Wes

2491
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:38,800
is if

2492
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:39,800
if I'm a VC firm

2493
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:40,800
and I'm looking at backing

2494
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:41,700
a massive threat to that project

2495
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:42,700
as if they ever get

2496
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:43,700
any kind of market share

2497
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:44,700
one of the big commercial

2498
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:45,700
hosting companies

2499
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:46,700
will just re-implement it

2500
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:47,700
See I got a little bit

2501
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,700
of a contrarian take here

2502
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:50,700
I think Ben's totally right

2503
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:51,700
and that's a great episode

2504
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:52,700
of the show

2505
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:53,700
but the key

2506
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:54,700
is long term

2507
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:55,700
he says

2508
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:56,700
VC makes sense

2509
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:57,700
for software

2510
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:58,700
because you have to spend

2511
01:08:58,800 --> 01:08:59,700
a lot of money

2512
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:00,700
and then you try to be profitable

2513
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:01,700
over the long term

2514
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:02,700
but the VCs of today

2515
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:03,700
that's not how we operate

2516
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:04,700
and I think we all got a little too hopeful

2517
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:05,700
that

2518
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:06,700
things like Mongo

2519
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:07,700
things on the billion scale

2520
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:08,700
things that

2521
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:09,700
you know San Francisco VCs

2522
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:10,600
are funding

2523
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:11,600
was actually a sustainable

2524
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:12,600
business model

2525
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:13,600
but

2526
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:14,600
Amazon was

2527
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:15,600
you know AWS didn't start

2528
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:16,600
till like 2007

2529
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:17,600
so we're really only

2530
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:18,600
one tick in here

2531
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:19,600
we've gone through one cycle

2532
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:20,600
and we're seeing

2533
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:21,600
we got really hopeful

2534
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:22,600
because it is great

2535
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:23,600
you do want

2536
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:24,600
companies that can be like

2537
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:25,600
you know like Elasticsearch

2538
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:26,600
for instance

2539
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:27,600
they're like this is a great product

2540
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:28,600
we've hired great developers

2541
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:29,600
to build it

2542
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:30,600
and now you can have it for free

2543
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:31,600
and it's open source

2544
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:32,600
but it turns out

2545
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:33,600
it's

2546
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:34,600
it's a lot more complicated

2547
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:36,600
I think you can still have

2548
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:37,600
those things

2549
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:38,600
but not at the scale

2550
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,500
of you know making huge amounts of money

2551
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:41,500
for people

2552
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:42,500
you might be able to build a sustainable consultancy

2553
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,500
on some open source software

2554
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,500
but I think the days of

2555
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:47,500
giant

2556
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,500
multi-billion dollar companies on them

2557
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,500
questionable

2558
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:52,500
it seems like it could be

2559
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:53,500
a huge issue

2560
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:54,500
because then it means

2561
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:55,500
only certain companies

2562
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:56,500
will have the scale

2563
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:58,500
to build those kinds of projects

2564
01:09:58,600 --> 01:09:59,500
and

2565
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:00,500
it also makes me wonder

2566
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:01,500
if this doesn't

2567
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,500
have something to do with the Red Hat sale

2568
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:04,500
to IBM

2569
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:05,500
here's here's what

2570
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:06,500
before I

2571
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:07,500
before I sound the alarm

2572
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:09,400
and I say that these large commercial cloud companies

2573
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:11,400
are going to consume

2574
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:12,400
open source projects

2575
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:13,400
that ever get successful

2576
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,400
I would like to get the audience's take

2577
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:16,400
but it does require

2578
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:18,400
like some serious homework

2579
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:20,400
and thought around this

2580
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:21,400
but I would really love

2581
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:22,400
to either have you join us

2582
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:23,400
next week in the mumble room

2583
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:24,400
or

2584
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,400
just go to linuxunplug.com slash contact

2585
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,400
but do consider the homework

2586
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:29,400
we'll have it linked in the show notes

2587
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:31,400
the first up is exponent

2588
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:33,400
episode 159 of

2589
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,400
Ben Thompson's podcast

2590
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:36,400
where they talk about this

2591
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,300
then

2592
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,300
I would encourage you

2593
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:40,300
to read his piece on

2594
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:41,300
Stratechery

2595
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:42,300
which we will also have linked

2596
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:43,300
in the show notes

2597
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:44,300
and then additionally

2598
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,300
one last thing

2599
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:46,300
is I would encourage you

2600
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:47,300
to listen to

2601
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:48,300
Late Night Linux

2602
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:49,300
episode 55

2603
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:51,300
where the boys just debate

2604
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:52,300
cloud lock-in

2605
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,300
versus on-premises

2606
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:55,300
to give you a fully

2607
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:56,300
rounded picture

2608
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:57,300
of the issue here

2609
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,300
and then

2610
01:10:58,400 --> 01:10:59,300
I would really encourage you

2611
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:00,300
to at least engage in that

2612
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:01,300
even if you're not going to participate

2613
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:02,300
in the podcast

2614
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:03,300
and but then

2615
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:04,300
if you do have the time

2616
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:05,300
come join us

2617
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:07,200
in email and let us know what you think

2618
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:09,200
I would throw into

2619
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:10,200
Brian Cantrell

2620
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:12,200
of all kinds of open source fame

2621
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:13,200
he's been blogging about this stuff too

2622
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:14,200
and it's a little bit different

2623
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:15,200
it's a little more focused on the licenses

2624
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:17,200
but I think it's an important component

2625
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:18,200
from someone who's been through

2626
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:19,200
the open source

2627
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:20,200
and trying to make money

2628
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:21,200
process

2629
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:22,200
yeah

2630
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:24,200
there's a lot of different

2631
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:25,200
moving pieces right now

2632
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:26,200
around this discussion

2633
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:28,200
and it's at a different scale now

2634
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:29,200
because

2635
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:30,200
essentially

2636
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:31,200
the thing that

2637
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:32,200
companies like AWS

2638
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:34,200
are benefiting from

2639
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:36,100
is the open source

2640
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:37,100
community nature of a project

2641
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:38,100
like MongoDB

2642
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,100
and Redis and others

2643
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:40,100
has led to

2644
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,100
strong developer adoption

2645
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,100
but then

2646
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:44,100
and that developer adoption

2647
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,100
is super beneficial

2648
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:46,100
for like

2649
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:47,100
creating applications

2650
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:49,100
that use that type of database

2651
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,100
it's great for that

2652
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:51,100
right

2653
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:52,100
you want to make it easy

2654
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,100
to just pull down a Docker container

2655
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:54,100
so that you can try it out

2656
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:55,100
if you're going to decide

2657
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:56,100
am I going to use this software

2658
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:57,100
in my new project

2659
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:58,100
yeah maybe you're building a prototype

2660
01:11:58,200 --> 01:11:59,100
or you're learning

2661
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:00,100
and then

2662
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:01,100
when it comes time

2663
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:02,100
to put it in production

2664
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:03,100
for millions of users

2665
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:04,000
to bang on it

2666
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:05,000
and you want to tell your boss

2667
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:06,000
what system they should use

2668
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:08,000
I mean

2669
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:09,000
who's going to fire you

2670
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:10,000
for suggesting DocumentDB

2671
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:11,000
you could go do

2672
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:12,000
your own bespoke

2673
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:13,000
implementation of MongoDB

2674
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:15,000
up on a VPS somewhere

2675
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:16,000
and manage it

2676
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:17,000
but then who's on call

2677
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:18,000
you?

2678
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:19,000
yeah and really

2679
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:20,000
if AWS has an issue

2680
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:21,000
that's not on you

2681
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:23,000
nobody gets fired

2682
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:24,000
for choosing AWS

2683
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:25,000
just like nobody got fired

2684
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:26,000
for choosing IBM

2685
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:27,000
and Microsoft

2686
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:28,000
back in the day

2687
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:30,000
and so just by being AWS

2688
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:32,000
I think they're going to have

2689
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:32,900
massive success

2690
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:33,900
with what is essentially

2691
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:34,900
a MongoDB

2692
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:35,900
competitor slash ripoff

2693
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:36,900
I mean

2694
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:37,900
ripoff is a little bit strong

2695
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:38,900
but yes right

2696
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:39,900
I mean they implement

2697
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:40,900
the same interface

2698
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:41,900
or at least largely compatible

2699
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:42,900
and they do that

2700
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:43,900
with other things right

2701
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:44,900
they've got Aurora

2702
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:45,900
their database

2703
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:46,900
and has a coming backend

2704
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:47,900
that they implement

2705
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:48,900
some like Postgres

2706
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:49,900
compatibility layers

2707
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:50,900
on top of

2708
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:51,900
so it's just

2709
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:52,900
the commoditization

2710
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:53,900
the world of cloud

2711
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:54,900
where once you've hired

2712
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:55,900
the one ops team

2713
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:56,900
to run your stuff

2714
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:57,900
you don't really want

2715
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:58,900
to branch out

2716
01:12:59,000 --> 01:12:59,900
yeah man

2717
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:00,900
I just feel like

2718
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:02,800
there's a lot of expectations

2719
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:03,800
for really large scale

2720
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:04,800
open source

2721
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:05,800
I would love to have

2722
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:06,800
a reality

2723
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:07,800
and a future

2724
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:08,800
where Red Hat

2725
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:09,800
wasn't the largest

2726
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:11,800
open source company ever

2727
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:12,800
free software company

2728
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:13,800
wouldn't that be great

2729
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:14,800
if we could have another

2730
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:15,800
free software

2731
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:16,800
open source success story

2732
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:17,800
that's even larger

2733
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:18,800
than Red Hat

2734
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:19,800
right yeah

2735
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:20,800
let's hope we haven't peaked

2736
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:21,800
right

2737
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:22,800
and that's my concern

2738
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:23,800
is that this sort of

2739
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,800
stifles the long term

2740
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:26,800
ramp

2741
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:27,800
and how big these companies

2742
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:28,800
can get

2743
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:29,800
when

2744
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:30,700
we want to the audience

2745
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:31,700
if we get good engagement

2746
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:32,700
people do their homework

2747
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:33,700
and turn around

2748
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:34,700
and give thoughtful responses

2749
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:35,700
we'll continue this

2750
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:36,700
conversation

2751
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:37,700
in next week's episode

2752
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:38,700
and hopefully we'll get

2753
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:39,700
the Ubuntu 19.04 first look

2754
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:40,700
in there too

2755
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:41,700
it's the Gen 2 challenge

2756
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:42,700
all over again

2757
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:43,700
I apologize about that

2758
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:44,700
in the meantime

2759
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,700
go get more Wes Payne

2760
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:47,700
and now Jim Salter

2761
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:48,700
over on the TechSnap

2762
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:49,700
TechSnap.Systems

2763
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,700
I'm really happy about that

2764
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:52,700
we've already talked about it

2765
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:53,700
but I just think

2766
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:54,700
it's super great Wes

2767
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:55,700
I wanted to mention

2768
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:56,700
well thank you

2769
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:57,700
good work on the first episode

2770
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:58,700
and there is more to come

2771
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:00,600
and of course you can go get him on Twitter

2772
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:01,600
he is at Wes Payne

2773
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:03,600
I am at Chris Elias

and that's what counts

2792
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:27,600
I think

2793
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,500
I'm starting to give up

2794
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:30,500

01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:24,300
I'm starting to give up

2819
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:25,300
starting to

2820
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:26,300
and also thank you to

2821
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:27,300
Alex

2822
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:28,300
for joining us

2823
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:29,300
to tell us about

2824
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:30,300
all of the homework that we have

2825
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,300
in the show notes as well

2826
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:32,300
LinuxUnplugged.com

2827
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:33,300
slash 285

2828
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:34,300
for all the links

2829
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:35,300
to everything we have

2830
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:36,300
in the show notes

2831
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,300
I'm not going to try to mispronounce it

2832
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:40,200
he was the one right before Jim

2833
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:41,200
Whitehurst

2834
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:43,200
and

2835
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:45,200
what's really interesting about it

2836
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:46,200
it's a new

2837
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:47,200
model

2838
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:48,200
of

2839
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:49,200
supporting

2840
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:50,200
open source projects

2841
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:51,200
so

2842
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:53,200
you know the Red Hat model is

2843
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:54,200
you buy a subscription

2844
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:55,200
for Linux

2845
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:56,200
and that goes to

2846
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:57,200
basically towards

2847
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:58,200
Linux development

2848
01:15:58,300 --> 01:15:59,200
for the most part right

2849
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:00,200
but the

2850
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:01,200
this one

2851
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:03,200
it's far more broad

2852
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:04,200
so like if you have

2853
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:05,200
like a lot of

2854
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:07,200
open source dependencies

2855
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,100
in your application

2856
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:11,100
you can

2857
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,100
go to

2858
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:13,100
Tidelift

2859
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:14,100
and say hey

2860
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:15,100
I need

2861
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:16,100
to make sure that

2862
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:17,100
this is

2863
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:18,100
getting developed

2864
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,100
and Tidelift will go

2865
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:20,100
and pay

2866
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:21,100
the

2867
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:22,100
project maintainer

2868
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:23,100
to continue

2869
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:24,100
to maintain the project

2870
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:25,100
it's like

2871
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:26,100
it's like a

2872
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:27,100
like not a foundation

2873
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:28,100
but

2874
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:29,100
yeah

2875
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:30,100
it's an interesting way

2876
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:31,100
of looking at it

2877
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:32,100
I think

2878
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:33,100
you know

2879
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:34,100
they just got

2880
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:35,100
Series B funding

2881
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:36,100
so we'll see

2882
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:37,000
you know

2883
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:38,000
where it goes

2884
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:39,000
I just heard about them

2885
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:40,000
a couple weeks ago

2886
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:41,000
they've been around

2887
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:42,000
apparently

2888
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:43,000
for a

2889
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:44,000
little over a year

2890
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,000
so

2891
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:46,000
yeah

2892
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:47,000
we'll see

2893
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:48,000
where it goes

2894
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:49,000
I'm really interested

2895
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:50,000
to see

2896
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:51,000
where it goes

2897
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:52,000
What's their website?

2898
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:54,000
It's Tidelift.com

2899
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:55,000
Good one, thank you

2900
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:56,000
that's good to know about

2901
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:57,000
thank you Brandon

2902
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:58,000
I've got to take on

2903
01:16:58,100 --> 01:16:59,000
the whole licenses

2904
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:00,000
MongoDB thing

2905
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:01,000
Yeah, do share

2906
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:02,000
Yeah so

2907
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:03,000
you know

2908
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:04,000
the typical model

2909
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:05,000
that has become

2910
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:05,900
common for

2911
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:06,900
open source companies

2912
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:07,900
is that

2913
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:08,900
they basically create a market

2914
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:09,900
for their skills

2915
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:10,900
by

2916
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:11,900
creating a product

2917
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:12,900
that

2918
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:13,900
is

2919
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:14,900
sufficiently complicated enough

2920
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:15,900
that

2921
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:16,900
other people require

2922
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:17,900
their skills to support

2923
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:18,900
and also

2924
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:19,900
that they want updates

2925
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:20,900
to that software

2926
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:21,900
so

2927
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:22,900
the problem being is that

2928
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:23,900
you have companies

2929
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:24,900
that

2930
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:25,900
also have the same amount

2931
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:26,900
of skills that you have

2932
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:27,900
and if your project

2933
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:28,900
is popular enough

2934
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:29,900
that

2935
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:30,900
they don't want to wait for you

2936
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:31,900
to do updates

2937
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:32,900
or they find your support

2938
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:33,900
too expensive

2939
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:34,800
on their own

2940
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:35,800
they lose that control

2941
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:36,800
and then

2942
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:37,800
you know

2943
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:38,800
groups like

2944
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:39,800
Mongo and

2945
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:40,800
there's been countless in the past

2946
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:42,800
there's the very real chance

2947
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:43,800
that they'll lose the control

2948
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:44,800
and then they're losing

2949
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:45,800
the whole reason

2950
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:46,800
that they created it

2951
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:47,800
in the first place

2952
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:48,800
I mean there's other

2953
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:49,800
more altruistic reasons

2954
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:50,800
for creating FOSS software

2955
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:51,800
but the typical

2956
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:52,800
I need to make money

2957
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:53,800
using FOSS software

2958
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:54,800
how do I do it

2959
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:55,800
this is a typical

2960
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:56,800
breakdown

2961
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:57,800
path

2962
01:17:57,900 --> 01:17:58,800
that happens

2963
01:17:58,900 --> 01:17:59,800
but you have to be prepared

2964
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:00,800
for that to happen

2965
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:01,800
if you want to delve

2966
01:18:01,900 --> 01:18:02,800
in the world of open source

2967
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,700
novels

2968
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:05,700
every open source company

2969
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,700
has a

2970
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:08,700
cash flow

2971
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:09,700
issues

2972
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:11,700
especially

2973
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:12,700
with getting people

2974
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:13,700
to buy their products

2975
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:14,700
because

2976
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:15,700
you can just go

2977
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:16,700
get it for free

2978
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:17,700
I mean

2979
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:18,700
Canonical

2980
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:19,700
could easily be

2981
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:20,700
larger than Red Hat

2982
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:21,700
if they could just

2983
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:22,700
figure out a way

2984
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:23,700
to monetize

2985
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:24,700
every Ubuntu license

2986
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:25,700
out there

2987
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:26,700
every Ubuntu

2988
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:27,700
installation

2989
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:28,700
out there right

2990
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:29,700
but that's just

2991
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:30,700
not going to happen

2992
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:31,700
same with MongoDB

2993
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:33,600
MongoDB would probably be huge

2994
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:35,600
but

2995
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:36,600
people can just

2996
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:37,600
go run their software

2997
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:38,600
for free

2998
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:40,600
so that's

2999
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:42,600
it's

3000
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:43,600
got to figure out

3001
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:44,600
a better way of

3002
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:45,600
getting

3003
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:46,600
money in the hands

3004
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:47,600
of developers

3005
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:48,600
I think that

3006
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:49,600
that's the big

3007
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:50,600
that's the big

3008
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:51,600
problem

3009
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:52,600
is

3010
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:53,600
you have to

3011
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:54,600
one of the things

3012
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:55,600
that I always

3013
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:56,600
have to remind people

3014
01:18:56,700 --> 01:18:57,600
is that

3015
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:58,600
software

3016
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:00,600
is not

3017
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:01,500
it's people's time

3018
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,500
it's people's

3019
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:04,500
you can't

3020
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:05,500
and they can't just

3021
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,500
keep working for free

3022
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:08,500
yeah it's like

3023
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:09,500
the Venn diagram

3024
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:10,500
that's existed

3025
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:11,500
ever since like

3026
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:12,500
1990s when they started

3027
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:13,500
doing this stuff is

3028
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:14,500
there's software

3029
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:15,500
that's

3030
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:16,500
the triangle

3031
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:17,500
you pick two

3032
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:18,500
of the three things

3033
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:19,500
you can have it

3034
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:20,500
high quality

3035
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:21,500
you can

3036
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:22,500
have it free

3037
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:23,500
and

3038
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:24,500
you can't have both of them

3039
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:25,500
like if you want

3040
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:26,500
good quality

3041
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:27,500
FOSS software

3042
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:28,500
you have to be able to pay the people

3043
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:29,500
that are making the FOSS software

3044
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:30,400
to create it well

3045
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:31,400
otherwise

3046
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:32,400
it'll be slow

3047
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:33,400
it'll be somebody working

3048
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:34,400
on their evenings and weekends

3049
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:36,400
it's a fundamental

3050
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:38,400
competition between

3051
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:39,400
people who are quite happy

3052
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:40,400
to use stuff for free

3053
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:41,400
and not

3054
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:43,400
fund the development of it

3055
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:44,400
and

3056
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:45,400
people who aren't willing

3057
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:46,400
to just spend all their time

3058
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:47,400
doing nothing

3059
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:48,400
and not eating

3060
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:49,400
and not living in a house

3061
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:50,400
developing software for you

3062
01:19:50,400 --> 01:20:00,300
this is negative
