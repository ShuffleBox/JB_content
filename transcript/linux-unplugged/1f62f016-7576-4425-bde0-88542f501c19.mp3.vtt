00:01.000 --> 00:04.240
Anybody in the mumble room having Wi-Fi issues?

00:04.240 --> 00:06.440
And do you have a Chromecast?

00:06.440 --> 00:09.160
Because it turns out that's all it takes.

00:09.160 --> 00:10.280
Have you heard about this?

00:10.280 --> 00:11.000
Really?

00:11.000 --> 00:12.200
Wait, what?

00:12.200 --> 00:15.280
Yeah, so router vendors are going to be pushing out

00:15.280 --> 00:16.000
firmware updates.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.480
Google's actually known about this for a little while.

00:19.480 --> 00:22.940
There's an issue recently with Google's Chromecast,

00:22.940 --> 00:27.440
if you have it on your network, and you launch the YouTube app

00:27.440 --> 00:29.120
on the phone or device.

00:29.120 --> 00:30.960
When the YouTube app wakes up, quote unquote,

00:30.960 --> 00:34.160
this is the documentation language, when it wakes up,

00:34.160 --> 00:37.760
it does a broadcast packet to see, actually,

00:37.760 --> 00:39.800
anything that supports Chromecast does this.

00:39.800 --> 00:41.960
It's not just YouTube, but this is the most common one.

00:41.960 --> 00:44.260
It does a broadcast to say, hey, is there any Chromecast

00:44.260 --> 00:44.960
devices here?

00:44.960 --> 00:47.560
I'm awake, and I would like to be able to broadcast to you.

00:47.560 --> 00:49.040
And these packets are normally sent

00:49.040 --> 00:52.280
in 20-second intervals, which in network timing

00:52.280 --> 00:55.040
is a pretty long time.

00:55.040 --> 00:58.120
But it turns out there's a bit of a bug,

00:58.120 --> 01:00.400
and sometimes the devices will broadcast

01:00.400 --> 01:03.880
a large amount of packets at very high speeds

01:03.880 --> 01:06.040
in a very short amount of time.

01:06.040 --> 01:11.480
And it's around 100,000 packets instead of a 20-second interval

01:11.480 --> 01:13.080
where it sends a packet.

01:13.080 --> 01:15.000
It's hundreds of thousands of packets

01:15.000 --> 01:16.960
as fast as your little device can cram it

01:16.960 --> 01:20.040
over your Wi-Fi network, overwhelming routers.

01:20.040 --> 01:22.520
And it's pretty much all of the major ones.

01:22.520 --> 01:23.520
NETGEARS acknowledges this.

01:23.520 --> 01:24.800
Linksys has acknowledged this.

01:24.800 --> 01:25.960
ASUS has acknowledged this.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.040
TP-Link has acknowledged this.

01:28.040 --> 01:30.440
And Google themselves has acknowledged this.

01:30.440 --> 01:34.040
Although Google says it impacts a small number of users,

01:34.040 --> 01:36.680
and they're committed to providing a fix in short order.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.920
Does it affect OpenWRT and LEED?

01:39.920 --> 01:42.280
I would think it'd be possible, but because it's

01:42.280 --> 01:43.880
like an overwhelming DDoS.

01:43.880 --> 01:47.160
It's not necessarily like a flaw in the software, I think.

01:47.160 --> 01:48.040
Right.

01:48.040 --> 01:51.520
Does it impact Google hardware, specifically like Google Wi-Fi?

01:51.520 --> 01:53.720
If you have, no, I don't know about Google Wi-Fi.

01:53.720 --> 01:56.280
But if you have a Chromecast, and a lot of us do,

01:56.280 --> 01:58.400
and then you have an app on your mobile device that

01:58.400 --> 02:01.440
supports Chromecast, this is what you get.

02:01.440 --> 02:04.440
What about half-supported devices?

02:04.440 --> 02:06.600
Thankfully, both of my Chromecasts

02:06.600 --> 02:07.960
are powered off the TV.

02:07.960 --> 02:10.080
So if the TV's off, the Chromecast's off.

02:10.080 --> 02:11.800
Same, yeah.

02:11.800 --> 02:15.640
Wonder if Roku's can affect this.

02:15.640 --> 02:17.480
They accept some Chromecast.

02:17.480 --> 02:20.000
Well, it's on the Chromecast side.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.080
It's sending out the packets from their Chromecast.

02:23.080 --> 02:24.720
And it uses UDP.

02:24.720 --> 02:26.880
There's no congestion control on UDP.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.560
Exactly.

02:28.560 --> 02:32.240
OK, so my Chromecast is getting unplugged today.

02:32.240 --> 02:48.800
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 232 for January 16, 2018.

02:48.800 --> 02:51.800
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

02:51.800 --> 02:54.760
that's fending off the plague, talking brand new Linux

02:54.760 --> 02:57.760
hardware, and answering your questions.

02:57.760 --> 02:58.960
My name is Chris.

02:58.960 --> 02:59.760
And I'm the beard.

02:59.760 --> 03:00.440
Hey, beard.

03:00.440 --> 03:04.640
Beard's joining me this week, but not Wes, because Wes got

03:04.640 --> 03:07.160
poisoned by Beard, so that way he could step up and actually

03:07.160 --> 03:08.120
be in the intro.

03:08.120 --> 03:09.080
So we got that taken care of.

03:09.080 --> 03:09.880
Good job, sir.

03:09.880 --> 03:11.800
Now, also coming up on this week's episode,

03:11.800 --> 03:15.580
we will go through a whole bunch of community news.

03:15.580 --> 03:18.440
This episode is really going to be all about the community,

03:18.440 --> 03:21.200
about stuff they're working on, about upcoming events,

03:21.200 --> 03:23.280
and then answering a lot of your questions.

03:23.280 --> 03:26.240
And Barton George from Dell will be joining us

03:26.240 --> 03:30.020
to talk about the new XPS 13 developer, the Sputnik

03:30.020 --> 03:35.000
line of their sweet Infinity edge-to-edge display laptops.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.400
Well, they just shipped out a brand new one

03:37.400 --> 03:40.180
with the latest eighth generation Intel processors,

03:40.180 --> 03:43.900
a bunch of new features, Ubuntu 16.04 installed by default.

03:43.900 --> 03:45.760
So Barton will come on.

03:45.760 --> 03:47.680
I'll pick his brain about the new machines.

03:47.680 --> 03:50.440
And then I'm going to ask him a couple of questions about,

03:50.440 --> 03:52.160
because he's in a large corporation,

03:52.160 --> 03:54.880
so he's maybe the perfect person to ask sitting

03:54.880 --> 03:58.160
at Dell in a large corporation shipping Linux desktops.

03:58.160 --> 04:00.920
Barton, what's it going to take to get Linux

04:00.920 --> 04:02.840
on every machine at Dell?

04:02.840 --> 04:05.460
What would it take for corporate systems

04:05.460 --> 04:08.520
to be able to switch over and get out of that Windows trench?

04:08.520 --> 04:09.600
And we talk about that.

04:09.600 --> 04:12.040
We talk about big trends that Dell's getting ready for that

04:12.040 --> 04:13.600
are coming down the pipe.

04:13.600 --> 04:17.880
And we talk about the transition to 1710, Gnome,

04:17.880 --> 04:19.520
a little Meltdown Inspector.

04:19.520 --> 04:21.600
It's all coming up later on in the show.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.000
So I think it's going to be, what are they,

04:24.000 --> 04:26.080
like not a doorstopper.

04:26.080 --> 04:28.080
It's going to be, I need a good name.

04:28.080 --> 04:30.680
Mumble Room, what's a good name for what this week's about?

04:30.680 --> 04:32.400
And hello, Virtual Log.

04:32.400 --> 04:34.040
This is like a blowout episode, right?

04:34.040 --> 04:35.040
It's Barnburner.

04:35.040 --> 04:36.080
It's a Barnburner!

04:36.080 --> 04:37.640
That's exactly what I was looking for.

04:37.640 --> 04:39.360
OK, hello, hello, hello, Mumble Room.

04:39.360 --> 04:40.120
Time appropriate greeting.

04:40.120 --> 04:40.620
Hello.

04:40.620 --> 04:41.120
Hello.

04:41.120 --> 04:41.600
What's up?

04:41.600 --> 04:42.100
Hello.

04:42.100 --> 04:42.600
Hello.

04:42.600 --> 04:43.280
Hello.

04:43.280 --> 04:45.960
Guys, boy, it's good to hear all your voices.

04:45.960 --> 04:47.080
I missed you guys.

04:47.080 --> 04:48.200
It's been a long week.

04:48.200 --> 04:51.200
But the only thing that really got me through this long week

04:51.200 --> 04:53.620
has been the good news coming out of the Plasma project.

04:53.620 --> 04:55.400
So we've got a couple of different things

04:55.400 --> 04:56.740
to cover for the Plasma desktop.

04:56.740 --> 04:59.440
I figured you Plasma desktop users have

04:59.440 --> 05:01.520
been yearning for some coverage.

05:01.520 --> 05:03.520
So there's a new LTS in the works.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.280
It's the second long-term support release

05:05.280 --> 05:08.160
from the Plasma 5 team.

05:08.160 --> 05:12.600
And they're working on fixing speed and stability.

05:12.600 --> 05:14.640
It's a speed and stability release.

05:14.640 --> 05:18.080
Boot time for the desktop has been improved by reviewing code

05:18.080 --> 05:21.500
and getting rid of anything they found that blocked execution.

05:21.500 --> 05:23.120
They've been triaging and fixing bugs

05:23.120 --> 05:24.560
in every aspect of the code base,

05:24.560 --> 05:26.960
tidying up artwork, removing corner cases,

05:26.960 --> 05:29.840
and ensuring cross-desktop integration.

05:29.840 --> 05:30.600
Interesting.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.360
Specifically in regard to the performance,

05:32.360 --> 05:34.280
because that's what got my attention,

05:34.280 --> 05:36.520
they say we have been concentrating on speed and memory

05:36.520 --> 05:39.480
improvements with the 5.12 LTS release.

05:39.480 --> 05:42.200
When Plasma is running, it now uses less CPU and less memory

05:42.200 --> 05:44.060
than previous versions.

05:44.060 --> 05:45.680
The time it takes to start Plasma desktop

05:45.680 --> 05:47.400
has been reduced dramatically.

05:47.400 --> 05:50.320
And Plasma support for running on Wayland

05:50.320 --> 05:52.640
is now more complete and more suitable

05:52.640 --> 05:54.560
for a wide range of testing.

05:54.560 --> 05:57.000
So they're ready to bake it into the LTS release.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.200
And they have got output resolution scaling working,

06:00.200 --> 06:02.960
screen rotation, enabling and disabling outputs

06:02.960 --> 06:04.960
through Kscreen, automatic screen rotation

06:04.960 --> 06:08.640
based on orientation sensors, automatic touch calibration.

06:08.640 --> 06:12.280
Ex-Wayland is no longer required to even run the Plasma desktop.

06:12.280 --> 06:13.760
Big one right there.

06:13.760 --> 06:15.800
Yeah, and Wayland Windows can now run full screen.

06:15.800 --> 06:17.120
That's a big one for the beard.

06:17.120 --> 06:19.280
Kaywin's been integrated with their night color system,

06:19.280 --> 06:20.000
which is awesome.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.320
That's so cool and kind of removes the need for people

06:22.320 --> 06:25.520
to even run Redshift anymore on the Plasma desktop.

06:25.520 --> 06:30.160
And the compositor is now automatically kind of smart,

06:30.160 --> 06:33.340
depending on the desktop and the input and responsiveness.

06:33.340 --> 06:34.880
And if you're using Wayland, there's

06:34.880 --> 06:36.200
been a lot of work there.

06:36.200 --> 06:41.080
So this really is being positioned as the Plasma

06:41.080 --> 06:42.200
desktop to use.

06:42.200 --> 06:43.480
It's version 5.12.

06:43.480 --> 06:45.520
It's in development right now.

06:45.520 --> 06:48.260
And they seem pretty excited about it.

06:48.260 --> 06:49.960
I'll defer to the Mumble Room for a moment

06:49.960 --> 06:51.560
if anybody wants to talk about Plasma.

06:51.560 --> 06:53.480
I do have a second part to the story, though.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.840
So going once, going twice.

06:55.840 --> 06:57.400
Hey, you know, it sounds great.

06:57.400 --> 07:02.680
But I hope, for their sake, that they lose the reputation

07:02.680 --> 07:05.720
of being bloated just with this release.

07:05.720 --> 07:06.920
You know what I'm saying?

07:06.920 --> 07:07.840
Yeah, yeah, maybe.

07:07.840 --> 07:10.880
I mean, I think that's sort of been, well,

07:10.880 --> 07:13.040
boy, it's really what's your definition of bloated.

07:13.040 --> 07:17.360
Because resources-wise, I feel like it

07:17.360 --> 07:19.600
hasn't been that bloated for several releases now.

07:19.600 --> 07:22.000
In fact, I was shocked when I started

07:22.000 --> 07:24.880
running Plasma for a while how little resources are used,

07:24.880 --> 07:26.400
based on just what everybody said.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.840
So that's one version of bloat.

07:28.840 --> 07:32.840
But another version of bloat is the package mess.

07:32.840 --> 07:34.420
And I know this is a soft spot, and they

07:34.420 --> 07:35.880
don't like people talking about it.

07:35.880 --> 07:40.800
But just two days ago, I was going through and updating

07:40.800 --> 07:42.960
my last remaining Arch system.

07:42.960 --> 07:45.280
And of course, there's a conflict

07:45.280 --> 07:48.240
between some standard accessibility feature

07:48.240 --> 07:51.100
and a Plasma desktop accessibility feature.

07:51.100 --> 07:52.760
And I have to choose between one of them.

07:52.760 --> 07:55.080
And either one of them breaks a series of dependencies.

07:55.080 --> 07:56.720
And just as a thought experiment,

07:56.720 --> 07:58.480
I went down the path of what would happen

07:58.480 --> 08:02.120
if I tried to uninstall the Plasma desktop accessibility

08:02.120 --> 08:03.600
version.

08:03.600 --> 08:07.280
And it unwinds 35 packages, which eventually ends up

08:07.280 --> 08:09.720
at uninstalling the entire Plasma desktop itself,

08:09.720 --> 08:12.940
because I want to remove a singular component.

08:12.940 --> 08:16.160
I just wanted to uninstall the accessibility metapackage

08:16.160 --> 08:18.240
and just remove the accessibility stuff altogether

08:18.240 --> 08:19.800
because it was hanging up my update.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.040
And then I would reinstall it later if I wanted it.

08:22.040 --> 08:23.360
But to get there, I eventually got

08:23.360 --> 08:25.280
to the point where I'd be uninstalling the entire.

08:25.280 --> 08:27.100
It's so intertangled with everything

08:27.100 --> 08:29.280
that that is another kind of bloat.

08:29.280 --> 08:31.160
And that's a reputation I don't know if they're

08:31.160 --> 08:32.040
going to get away from for a while.

08:32.040 --> 08:34.400
They might be able to conquer the reputation one.

08:34.400 --> 08:35.960
But people will still be throwing that bloat term

08:35.960 --> 08:39.940
around, I think, because of that package mess,

08:39.940 --> 08:42.080
unless somebody could snap all that up.

08:42.080 --> 08:43.700
Yeah, that's something they were trying

08:43.700 --> 08:47.360
to get rid of when they went on to Plasma 5 and KDE

08:47.360 --> 08:48.040
Frameworks 5.

08:48.040 --> 08:50.380
They were trying to get rid of all that dependency issue.

08:50.380 --> 08:53.520
And now I'm hearing and actually using it, too.

08:53.520 --> 08:58.440
It's just when the needle's at 11 and now it's

08:58.440 --> 09:01.280
been dialed back to 7.

09:01.280 --> 09:04.000
But my opinion, there's more dialing back to go, I think.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.640
JJ, you had a question about the undestructible desktop.

09:06.640 --> 09:08.600
Are you talking about the Bulletproof project

09:08.600 --> 09:09.940
we had a while ago?

09:09.940 --> 09:10.480
Yes, sir.

09:10.480 --> 09:11.040
Yes, sir.

09:11.040 --> 09:15.160
I was sort of trying to point that also in terms

09:15.160 --> 09:19.960
of your recent crashes with Gnome and comparing that

09:19.960 --> 09:22.360
to switching over to a new desktop possible.

09:22.360 --> 09:26.480
Yeah, the unbreakable Bulletproof desktop project

09:26.480 --> 09:28.600
sort of is what got me going down the path of solace

09:28.600 --> 09:29.840
for a while.

09:29.840 --> 09:32.800
But then I ended up having some issues with Budgie,

09:32.800 --> 09:34.120
and so I moved off.

09:34.120 --> 09:36.600
And that's sort of when the project died.

09:36.600 --> 09:40.440
However, recently, as a thought experiment,

09:40.440 --> 09:43.320
I've thought about how it might be fun to just poke

09:43.320 --> 09:46.040
at Fedora Atomic Workstation.

09:46.040 --> 09:50.080
So I'm going to try to have someone from that group

09:50.080 --> 09:54.360
on in a few weeks to talk more about that as a possibility.

09:54.360 --> 09:57.480
That kind of transactional update, whatever it might be,

09:57.480 --> 10:00.040
if it maybe comes via snaps and flat packs,

10:00.040 --> 10:03.560
or if it's something that's for the entire way you deploy

10:03.560 --> 10:05.560
all software on the system, more like Atomic,

10:05.560 --> 10:07.640
there may be a solution somewhere in there.

10:07.640 --> 10:09.220
I just don't feel like we're there yet.

10:09.220 --> 10:14.220
I do genuinely feel like we're on the right track to that,

10:14.440 --> 10:17.440
in part because of snaps and flat packs and Docker

10:17.440 --> 10:20.280
and all these other things that we love to hate too.

10:20.280 --> 10:23.080
Yeah, and personally, I'm sort of on this similar boat

10:23.080 --> 10:24.760
with me switching back and forth

10:24.760 --> 10:26.520
between Ubuntu distributions,

10:26.520 --> 10:30.480
but I've been stable on Ubuntu Mate for a little while.

10:31.560 --> 10:35.320
Yeah, it is a nice landing spot, isn't it, Mr. Wimpy?

10:35.320 --> 10:36.720
Wimpy, I was just thinking of you

10:36.720 --> 10:39.120
because you and I have gone back and forth

10:39.120 --> 10:41.200
about the transition to Wayland

10:41.200 --> 10:42.200
and some of our different thoughts

10:42.200 --> 10:44.440
about what kind of transition

10:44.440 --> 10:46.360
that may actually end up being.

10:46.360 --> 10:47.720
And so, Wimpy, I wanted to know what you thought

10:47.720 --> 10:51.700
about this post on the Kaywin development blog

10:51.700 --> 10:56.000
about Kaywin is now considering X11

10:56.000 --> 10:57.980
as indefinitely feature frozen,

10:57.980 --> 11:00.920
that their support for X11 is feature frozen.

11:00.920 --> 11:04.640
They'll still do maintenance, so security fixes and whatnot,

11:04.640 --> 11:07.600
but specifically, they won't be making

11:07.600 --> 11:09.160
specific improvements to X11.

11:09.160 --> 11:14.160
Kaywin won't be adjusted to any new requirements

11:14.520 --> 11:17.000
in the X server, Mesa or the input stack

11:17.000 --> 11:18.240
or proprietary drivers.

11:18.240 --> 11:19.920
If something breaks, it's the fault

11:19.920 --> 11:21.280
of those components which broke it,

11:21.280 --> 11:23.720
and they're going to be focusing their effort,

11:23.720 --> 11:26.360
their development efforts on Wayland

11:26.360 --> 11:28.680
after Plasma Desktop 512 ships.

11:28.680 --> 11:29.800
What do you think about this, Wimpy,

11:29.800 --> 11:31.360
about going just all in on Wayland

11:31.360 --> 11:34.680
and saying that X11's done, it's done?

11:35.640 --> 11:37.620
Well, KDE are in the fortunate position

11:37.620 --> 11:39.840
where they've invested a huge amount of effort

11:39.840 --> 11:43.900
over the years to keep pace with Wayland as it's evolved,

11:43.900 --> 11:47.560
and the only two desktops right now,

11:47.560 --> 11:49.680
or rather, the only two desktops

11:49.680 --> 11:53.480
that we've had for a long time, Gnome and KDE,

11:53.480 --> 11:55.920
have arrived with Wayland support,

11:55.920 --> 11:59.560
so it makes sense for them to invest in the future.

11:59.560 --> 12:04.360
And that's their project decision.

12:04.360 --> 12:07.240
I mean, if they feel it's ready for prime time, then.

12:07.240 --> 12:09.560
That's pretty political, I'll admit.

12:09.560 --> 12:12.800
I gotta say, because to me, I feel like a lot of users

12:12.800 --> 12:16.200
are gonna have a super rocky transition to Wayland.

12:16.200 --> 12:18.920
I wonder if it's not gonna be 10 times harder

12:18.920 --> 12:21.080
than the community expects it to be.

12:21.080 --> 12:24.480
I don't know about this, because what I haven't done

12:24.480 --> 12:29.200
is I haven't run a Wayland-composited desktop

12:29.200 --> 12:33.560
or window manager other than Gnome 3.

12:33.560 --> 12:36.880
So some of the rough edges that I've seen on Gnome 3,

12:36.880 --> 12:38.240
That's a good point.

12:38.240 --> 12:40.640
I don't know how that translates to things

12:40.640 --> 12:44.560
like Sway or Lyri or KDE.

12:44.560 --> 12:45.520
Yeah, point well made.

12:45.520 --> 12:46.880
You could be absolutely correct there.

12:46.880 --> 12:48.800
And Martin points out in the blog post

12:50.300 --> 12:53.060
that they've sort of architected their,

12:54.320 --> 12:57.520
essentially their Wayland system, their KWIN,

12:57.520 --> 13:00.140
they've architected it in such a way that

13:00.140 --> 13:02.700
they don't really need to implement a lot of stuff

13:02.700 --> 13:03.540
at that level.

13:03.540 --> 13:06.480
If you read through the blog post,

13:06.480 --> 13:09.640
he says that there will be new features that'll come along,

13:09.640 --> 13:12.680
but most functionality in KWIN is independent

13:12.680 --> 13:13.980
of the windowing system.

13:13.980 --> 13:17.400
Any improvements to the areas that benefit Wayland Annex 11,

13:17.400 --> 13:19.760
so if they make some new feature,

13:19.760 --> 13:22.360
and he gives examples like tool tips on decoration buttons,

13:22.360 --> 13:26.280
improved blur effects, or rework of side desktop effects,

13:26.280 --> 13:28.040
they're making those improvements to KWIN.

13:28.040 --> 13:31.080
They're not necessarily X11 or Wayland specific.

13:31.080 --> 13:33.520
Both X11 and Wayland users will get that stuff

13:33.520 --> 13:35.480
because of the way they've architected KWIN.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.760
And so with that in mind,

13:37.760 --> 13:38.980
I think it does make a lot of sense.

13:38.980 --> 13:40.680
I think that's actually a pretty good move.

13:40.680 --> 13:45.340
And it does kind of make me want to try out Plasma 512,

13:45.340 --> 13:46.720
probably eventually 513,

13:46.720 --> 13:48.160
because that's really when all this stuff lands

13:48.160 --> 13:49.560
is Plasma 513.

13:49.560 --> 13:51.760
Does kind of really kind of make me want to try it

13:51.760 --> 13:53.560
because you make a fair point, Wimpy.

13:53.560 --> 13:55.960
I think the bulk of my experience

13:55.960 --> 13:58.820
with a few exceptions has been Gnome 3 on Wayland,

13:58.820 --> 14:02.120
and I may have made some assumptions

14:02.120 --> 14:04.420
based on that experience that aren't fair.

14:04.420 --> 14:06.360
So I think when time gets right,

14:06.360 --> 14:08.760
I got to spend some time on KWIN and Wayland

14:08.760 --> 14:10.700
and just see how that compares.

14:11.640 --> 14:12.680
That's a good point.

14:12.680 --> 14:13.520
All right.

14:14.800 --> 14:16.960
It's some really, really good news this week.

14:16.960 --> 14:20.520
We talked about it pretty in depth on Linux action news,

14:20.520 --> 14:24.640
but I'd be derelict in my duties

14:24.640 --> 14:26.080
if I didn't tell you guys about this here

14:26.080 --> 14:27.340
on the unplugged program.

14:27.340 --> 14:30.920
The city of Barcelona is switching to Linux

14:30.920 --> 14:34.560
and open source software in a pretty smart way,

14:34.560 --> 14:38.240
and they're doing it in a pretty smooth timeline.

14:38.240 --> 14:41.700
So first of all, the first thing they're really doing

14:43.020 --> 14:45.520
before they've even switched out a single desktop

14:46.440 --> 14:49.300
is they're going to invest 70% of their software budget

14:49.300 --> 14:51.160
into open source software development.

14:52.140 --> 14:53.500
Then they're creating a transition period

14:53.500 --> 14:55.880
that lasts until the spring of 2019,

14:55.880 --> 14:59.040
and they're going to replace Microsoft Office

14:59.040 --> 15:00.040
with LibreOffice.

15:00.040 --> 15:03.400
They're going to replace Internet Explorer with Firefox.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.480
They're going to do that type of transition,

15:05.480 --> 15:07.800
and then once everybody's up and running

15:07.800 --> 15:08.820
on these applications,

15:08.820 --> 15:10.960
and they've developed the new backend applications they need

15:10.960 --> 15:13.040
and probably like web versions of them,

15:13.040 --> 15:14.880
that's an assumption on my part,

15:14.880 --> 15:16.720
they're going to move people over to Ubuntu.

15:16.720 --> 15:18.320
They're going to just ship with the Ubuntu desktop

15:18.320 --> 15:21.060
instead of trying to build their own desktop,

15:21.060 --> 15:23.440
which is really where Munich went off in the weeds,

15:23.440 --> 15:28.440
and they're already running 1,000 Ubuntu-based desktops

15:28.480 --> 15:31.260
right now as a pilot project.

15:33.760 --> 15:36.900
This is how you do this.

15:36.900 --> 15:39.680
They're doing essentially all the things right here.

15:39.680 --> 15:44.320
Like, I was joking with Joe on Linux Action News,

15:44.320 --> 15:47.120
but I kind of want to know what you think, Beard,

15:47.120 --> 15:51.320
is this the silver lining of Munich blowing up

15:51.320 --> 15:52.380
in the Linux community's face,

15:52.380 --> 15:54.080
and the fact that it was a public thing

15:54.080 --> 15:56.840
that Microsoft fans like Paul Thrott today

15:56.840 --> 16:00.600
is making a Munich joke on Twitter today?

16:01.840 --> 16:06.460
But maybe the silver lining is cities like Barcelona

16:06.460 --> 16:08.520
can watch that and go, oh shit, don't do that.

16:08.520 --> 16:09.760
Yeah, learn from their mistakes.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.920
I think that's exactly right.

16:12.920 --> 16:15.720
I mean, you just do a staged migration.

16:15.720 --> 16:17.080
That way, if you have problems,

16:17.080 --> 16:18.960
you can roll back that one specific step

16:18.960 --> 16:20.000
instead of the whole thing.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.280
Yeah, I hope this works.

16:22.280 --> 16:24.320
JJ, you have thought about government

16:24.320 --> 16:26.520
and funding of open-source software?

16:26.520 --> 16:29.280
Well, sort of the usage of a software in government,

16:29.280 --> 16:31.720
like a lot of these systems are Windows-based,

16:31.720 --> 16:34.240
and a lot of them are using older versions of Windows,

16:34.240 --> 16:37.440
and hopefully this Barcelona example,

16:37.440 --> 16:39.400
it seems to be doing all the right stuff,

16:39.400 --> 16:40.880
and like you mentioned before,

16:40.880 --> 16:45.640
and maybe it'll bring a spur to some certain universities

16:45.640 --> 16:47.840
that are reluctant to support Linux,

16:47.840 --> 16:52.120
or certain companies, certain support companies.

16:52.120 --> 16:56.680
Currently, I'm in a university where their IT department

16:56.680 --> 16:59.880
sort of looks down upon Linux at this moment.

16:59.880 --> 17:01.840
Yeah, I've been there.

17:01.840 --> 17:03.960
Boy, that seems like an attitude of 10 years ago, though.

17:03.960 --> 17:07.160
That's sort of unfortunate to hear that in 2018.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.560
Well, I mean, thankfully, some of the professors

17:09.560 --> 17:12.040
are somewhat like one of the professors

17:12.040 --> 17:14.600
that just transferred over to my university.

17:14.600 --> 17:18.120
He's sort of been a pro-Linux advocate,

17:18.120 --> 17:21.080
sort of been, even though he doesn't say,

17:21.080 --> 17:25.320
like, he uses Linux for his code examples and all that,

17:25.320 --> 17:29.000
but he's not like, he's like an advocate,

17:29.000 --> 17:32.560
but he's not like outright wears it on his sleeve,

17:32.560 --> 17:33.520
if that makes any sense.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can understand that.

17:35.800 --> 17:40.280
Well, so Popey's drawn my attention to it,

17:40.280 --> 17:42.800
so hashtag blowing Popey.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.040
Thank you so much, Popey.

17:44.040 --> 17:46.840
Breaking news right here on the Unplugged program.

17:46.840 --> 17:49.400
This is CNN breaking news.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.440
Crypto is ruined.

17:51.440 --> 17:52.640
Everything is ruined.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.240
This is why we can't have nice things.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.960
Bitcoin has gone bust.

17:57.040 --> 17:59.160
Popey, you're our Bitcoin reporter on the scene.

17:59.160 --> 18:00.000
What are your thoughts, sir?

18:00.000 --> 18:02.200
What's your analysis of the current Bitcoin crypto market?

18:02.200 --> 18:03.520
All crypto coins are down.

18:03.520 --> 18:04.520
Your analysis, sir?

18:05.560 --> 18:07.600
Those red colors, they're not good, are they?

18:07.600 --> 18:08.720
I don't think so, yeah.

18:08.720 --> 18:09.680
It seems like those are bad, right?

18:09.680 --> 18:10.960
And they're way over on the far side.

18:10.960 --> 18:11.920
You see how far over they are?

18:11.920 --> 18:12.760
That seems bad too, right?

18:12.760 --> 18:14.520
Yeah, they got minus signs and everything.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.000
That doesn't look good to me.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.480
Oh, you got a prediction

18:19.480 --> 18:22.240
if this thing's gonna go down to 5,000?

18:22.240 --> 18:23.080
What do you think?

18:23.080 --> 18:24.560
I know you're a big follower.

18:24.560 --> 18:27.440
Yeah, I think everyone should switch to Monero.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.280
There you go.

18:28.280 --> 18:29.960
Yeah, okay, okay.

18:29.960 --> 18:34.040
I had a prediction on the Ubuntu podcast

18:34.040 --> 18:35.680
for the end of year predictions

18:35.680 --> 18:38.920
that said that in December 2018,

18:38.920 --> 18:41.200
the price of Bitcoin would be,

18:41.200 --> 18:43.320
give or take a couple of thousand dollars,

18:43.320 --> 18:46.520
the same as it was in December 2017,

18:46.520 --> 18:48.920
and cited a massive crash,

18:48.920 --> 18:52.200
but a recovery that we've not seen in Bitcoin before.

18:52.200 --> 18:54.200
Yep, as soon as I heard that prediction,

18:54.200 --> 18:55.160
I said to myself,

18:55.160 --> 18:56.760
shit, that's way better than my prediction.

18:56.760 --> 18:57.800
He's absolutely right.

18:57.800 --> 18:58.640
And I knew it.

18:58.640 --> 19:01.320
In fact, after I thought to myself,

19:01.320 --> 19:03.320
I wouldn't be surprised if in the next month

19:03.320 --> 19:04.760
we see this thing get down to 10,000,

19:04.760 --> 19:06.120
and now here we are at 11,000.

19:06.120 --> 19:08.120
I hate making predictions about Bitcoin.

19:08.120 --> 19:09.360
I totally blame Joe for that.

19:09.360 --> 19:12.000
I'm just kidding, Joe, I don't.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.240
It was the meme-y thing to make predictions about

19:15.240 --> 19:16.200
at the end of the year.

19:16.200 --> 19:17.040
Yeah, it was huge.

19:17.040 --> 19:20.080
Yep, yep, and now it's going down like crazy.

19:20.080 --> 19:22.400
You know, I still maintain that open source currency

19:22.400 --> 19:23.640
for fun internet money

19:23.640 --> 19:26.880
or for clandestine worldwide transactions

19:26.880 --> 19:28.200
still has a value.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.320
It's still, I think, I don't think,

19:30.320 --> 19:31.160
I don't know if it's Bitcoin.

19:31.160 --> 19:33.040
See, the problem, I think what happened was

19:33.040 --> 19:35.400
is people started realizing that,

19:35.400 --> 19:36.520
at least in my opinion,

19:36.520 --> 19:38.960
that these transaction costs were getting to the point

19:38.960 --> 19:40.680
where essentially you had unusable Bitcoin.

19:40.680 --> 19:44.920
If you had like some Bitcoin Satoshis hanging around,

19:44.920 --> 19:45.760
they were unusable.

19:45.760 --> 19:47.480
You couldn't, you would have to spend more

19:47.480 --> 19:48.320
than they were worth to get them

19:48.320 --> 19:51.360
to even move across the network at any reliable speed

19:51.360 --> 19:53.640
for any kind of like online transaction.

19:53.640 --> 19:56.680
And I think once that really sunk in with people,

19:56.680 --> 19:57.520
this is what happened.

19:57.520 --> 20:00.480
Maybe if they would have solved the blockchain,

20:00.480 --> 20:02.400
the block size issue months and months

20:02.400 --> 20:03.320
and months and months ago

20:03.320 --> 20:06.120
when it was a hot topic at the beginning of 2017,

20:06.120 --> 20:07.640
we might not be here right now.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.400
But they punted on a solution.

20:09.400 --> 20:11.800
Several forks emerged as a result.

20:11.800 --> 20:16.240
And this is, I think, that playing out right now

20:16.240 --> 20:18.920
because the network became unsustainable.

20:18.920 --> 20:20.420
Just too slow, too expensive.

20:22.560 --> 20:24.960
It is probably gonna come back up eventually though.

20:24.960 --> 20:27.000
So I'm sure people will call it a fire sale.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.720
There was an article, I don't know if you saw it, Wimpy,

20:28.720 --> 20:32.160
going around that, it was pretty popular,

20:32.160 --> 20:34.880
so you may have, going around that just several,

20:34.880 --> 20:36.960
just a couple of key Bitcoin players

20:36.960 --> 20:39.880
were moving the market as much as 40% some days

20:39.880 --> 20:41.180
back in the Mt. Gox days.

20:42.660 --> 20:44.480
Just a couple of people.

20:44.480 --> 20:47.360
I can imagine in the Mt. Gox days that was fairly easy.

20:47.360 --> 20:50.200
That was, those were dark days.

20:50.200 --> 20:51.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it seems to be getting,

20:51.920 --> 20:52.740
it's interesting though,

20:52.740 --> 20:55.760
that story is getting a lot of attention today.

20:55.760 --> 20:56.960
So it's back from the Mt. Gox day,

20:56.960 --> 20:59.320
but today's the day that it's getting passed around

20:59.320 --> 21:00.380
a lot online.

21:01.400 --> 21:02.880
And who knows, by the time this episode

21:02.880 --> 21:04.000
actually is available for download,

21:04.000 --> 21:06.440
it could be down another $5,000.

21:06.440 --> 21:07.360
I don't mean to laugh, I'm sorry,

21:07.360 --> 21:09.200
I know some people are dying.

21:09.200 --> 21:13.880
Jeez, I've always kind of figured this could happen.

21:13.880 --> 21:16.760
All right, well, I want to give an overview

21:16.760 --> 21:18.960
of a bunch of really cool community events

21:18.960 --> 21:21.800
that are coming up in just the next couple of months,

21:21.800 --> 21:24.560
including, oh, you know what I don't have a link for,

21:24.560 --> 21:26.480
is that there are flaw stocks.

21:26.480 --> 21:28.560
You guys, so you guys in the Mumble Room,

21:28.560 --> 21:31.980
if you have any upcoming events in the community

21:31.980 --> 21:33.280
that you want to spread the word about,

21:33.280 --> 21:36.600
I'll give you a few moments to think about it.

21:36.600 --> 21:39.120
So prepare your links, get them ready for Discord,

21:39.120 --> 21:40.280
and then we can mention them here on the show

21:40.280 --> 21:41.100
if you have any.

21:41.100 --> 21:42.600
And I'll take a moment and I'll thank Ting

21:42.600 --> 21:45.480
for sponsoring the show while you guys prepare yourselves.

21:45.480 --> 21:49.660
Linux.ting.com is where you go to get $25 off a device

21:49.660 --> 21:52.360
or $25 in service credits.

21:52.360 --> 21:54.280
This is pretty sweet because they have a CDMA

21:54.280 --> 21:56.720
and GSM network, so you can probably bring a phone

21:56.720 --> 21:58.520
and get $25 in service credits.

21:58.520 --> 22:03.140
And the way Ting works is you only pay for what you use.

22:03.140 --> 22:06.120
Your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes.

22:06.120 --> 22:08.960
No contracts, you just pay for what you use.

22:08.960 --> 22:11.280
It's $6 for the line and your usage.

22:11.280 --> 22:13.720
Average Ting bill is gonna be around $23

22:13.720 --> 22:14.920
per month per phone.

22:15.840 --> 22:16.880
That's amazing.

22:16.880 --> 22:17.720
Think about that.

22:17.720 --> 22:21.400
I went from, before even all the taxes were done,

22:21.400 --> 22:23.020
and the final bill was higher than this,

22:23.020 --> 22:25.840
but like right around a base bill of $120 a month

22:27.200 --> 22:29.720
for my three phones, and I think that some,

22:29.720 --> 22:32.360
I don't know how it goes from 120 to like 165

22:32.360 --> 22:35.320
after all the crazy taxes and weird fees.

22:35.320 --> 22:37.120
It just, it seems unsustainable,

22:37.120 --> 22:39.680
but yet they make billions in revenue.

22:39.680 --> 22:44.680
And if somebody could get in like a Starship Enterprise

22:45.000 --> 22:47.140
and go around the sun and turn back time

22:47.140 --> 22:48.680
and then relaunch wireless networks,

22:48.680 --> 22:50.000
they'd all have to do it this way.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.360
It's pay for what you use.

22:51.360 --> 22:54.280
You just pay for however much you talk, text, and data you use.

22:54.280 --> 22:57.260
They give you really good tools to control all of it.

22:57.260 --> 22:59.440
I've been a Ting customer now for three years

22:59.440 --> 23:02.360
and called them twice.

23:02.360 --> 23:04.600
One was because I was doing something crazy with a MiFi,

23:04.600 --> 23:06.280
and the other was because I didn't know

23:06.280 --> 23:07.600
you could actually activate a phone

23:07.600 --> 23:08.920
on their website at first.

23:08.920 --> 23:11.520
It's like, what company lets you do that?

23:11.520 --> 23:14.700
But they do, and it's great, which means now,

23:14.700 --> 23:16.460
like I turn MiFis on and off like crazy.

23:16.460 --> 23:17.600
It's just, it's perfect for me

23:17.600 --> 23:20.880
because I take advantage of both network CDMA and GSM.

23:20.880 --> 23:22.800
They always have a very active blog.

23:22.800 --> 23:25.180
They're talking about right now a referral giveaway.

23:25.180 --> 23:26.340
You can check that out at their blog.

23:26.340 --> 23:28.960
Just start by going to linux.ting.com.

23:28.960 --> 23:30.260
That'll take some money off a device

23:30.260 --> 23:31.520
or give you service credit,

23:31.520 --> 23:32.360
and then you can get started

23:32.360 --> 23:35.480
with pay for what you use mobile wireless.

23:35.480 --> 23:39.020
Linux.ting.com, linux.ting.com,

23:39.020 --> 23:42.000
and thanks to Ting for sponsoring the unplugged program.

23:42.000 --> 23:45.920
Okay, guys, so does anybody have a community event

23:45.920 --> 23:46.800
that they want to pass along?

23:46.800 --> 23:48.480
I'll give a plug for one that's coming up

23:48.480 --> 23:50.400
in just a couple of days to warm us up.

23:50.400 --> 23:55.200
Devconf.cz is a 10th annual free Red Hat-sponsored

23:55.200 --> 23:56.880
community conference for developers, admins,

23:56.880 --> 23:59.680
and dev-op engineers, and many more,

23:59.680 --> 24:01.480
and it's in the Czech Republic.

24:01.480 --> 24:03.200
So I'll have a link to that in the show notes

24:03.200 --> 24:04.120
if you're gonna be there.

24:04.120 --> 24:06.320
It's the city of Brno, B-R-N-O,

24:06.320 --> 24:08.360
so I'm probably butchering that,

24:08.360 --> 24:10.980
and it's at the Faculty of Information Technology.

24:10.980 --> 24:12.360
I have all that information in the show notes.

24:12.360 --> 24:15.120
January 26th, I believe, is yes.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.760
The 26th through the 28th online registration

24:17.760 --> 24:22.680
is already open if you go to devconf.cz.

24:22.680 --> 24:23.520
Give them a little mention

24:23.520 --> 24:25.960
because that is coming up right around the corner.

24:25.960 --> 24:27.680
The other one that's just not too far,

24:27.680 --> 24:31.360
at least in my world, is Linux Fest Northwest 2018,

24:31.360 --> 24:33.480
April 28th through the 29th.

24:33.480 --> 24:35.880
You know Jupyter Broadcasting's gonna be there.

24:35.880 --> 24:38.400
We're gonna probably do something different

24:38.400 --> 24:39.320
than we've ever done before.

24:39.320 --> 24:40.600
I don't quite have it all worked out,

24:40.600 --> 24:42.920
but we're thinking about potentially attempting

24:42.920 --> 24:46.000
to record one of each show that we can there.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.360
So instead of just sitting there on the livestream

24:49.360 --> 24:53.080
and just sort of DJing and just sort of shooting the S,

24:53.080 --> 24:55.640
we'll actually be doing shows live there,

24:55.640 --> 24:58.320
maybe all of the shows if we can, as many as we can,

24:58.320 --> 25:00.960
live at Linux Fest, maybe pulling different appropriate

25:00.960 --> 25:02.560
guests for different types of shows.

25:02.560 --> 25:07.000
Alan will be there with us and it's always a great time.

25:07.000 --> 25:11.640
So April 28th through the 29th, Linux Fest or lfnw.org.

25:11.640 --> 25:14.960
They have a call for, if you want to talk,

25:14.960 --> 25:17.080
they still have an open presentation.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.360
You can submit it now for like a couple of more days.

25:19.360 --> 25:23.600
So get that in if you want to do that, lfnw.org.

25:23.600 --> 25:26.980
And then Floss Talk Live, which I was gonna get more

25:26.980 --> 25:29.760
from Joe on and I forgot, cause I'm a bad person.

25:29.760 --> 25:31.320
But, or no, was it-

25:31.320 --> 25:32.600
Good job, I'm here now then.

25:32.600 --> 25:34.300
Oh, well then there, look at, geez.

25:34.300 --> 25:35.980
Geez, you just say his name and he shows up.

25:35.980 --> 25:38.640
That's, so was it Floss Talk we were gonna,

25:38.640 --> 25:40.320
now I'm actually thinking it wasn't Floss Talk.

25:40.320 --> 25:43.000
I'm thinking it was Fozdom, actually, now that you're here.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.200
So Joe, what the hell's going on?

25:44.200 --> 25:45.240
Tell people about it.

25:46.680 --> 25:49.120
So Floss Talk Live, not Floss Talk Live.

25:49.120 --> 25:52.760
Ah, that's what I, I knew I was mixing something up.

25:52.760 --> 25:53.600
Yeah, yeah.

25:53.600 --> 25:57.280
So it's a live event that's happening in June.

25:57.280 --> 25:58.900
Okay.

25:58.900 --> 26:02.100
And it's, well, we've done it for the last couple of years

26:02.100 --> 26:02.940
in the summer.

26:02.940 --> 26:06.520
It's in a small pub in King's Cross in London.

26:06.520 --> 26:10.920
And it's traditionally been Linux Voice, Ubuntu Podcast,

26:10.920 --> 26:13.120
Linux Luddites, or Late Night Linux.

26:13.120 --> 26:16.600
And then a mashup show featuring Stuart Langridge

26:16.600 --> 26:19.420
and Dave from Geek News Radio.

26:19.420 --> 26:21.680
And it's just been an excuse to get together, drink,

26:21.680 --> 26:23.120
and watch some live podcasts.

26:23.120 --> 26:24.080
Nice.

26:24.080 --> 26:24.920
When is it?

26:24.920 --> 26:26.800
Do you guys have a, do you have like the,

26:26.800 --> 26:28.720
I know the site's, is the site updated yet?

26:28.720 --> 26:29.960
I don't think so, right?

26:30.960 --> 26:32.240
No, I haven't updated the site.

26:32.240 --> 26:34.440
I've updated the Twitter, but not the website.

26:34.440 --> 26:37.000
All right, so it will be at fostalk.com

26:37.000 --> 26:37.960
eventually for details,

26:37.960 --> 26:39.440
and then go check it out on Twitter right now.

26:39.440 --> 26:42.800
I'll put a link to the Twitter in the show nizzles.

26:42.800 --> 26:43.680
There you go.

26:43.680 --> 26:44.520
So maybe we'll-

26:44.520 --> 26:46.240
We've got our hotel room already.

26:46.240 --> 26:47.060
Yeah?

26:47.060 --> 26:48.160
Oh, GC now?

26:48.160 --> 26:49.480
Now I'm getting FOMO.

26:49.480 --> 26:51.040
God dang it, guys.

26:51.040 --> 26:53.800
Come on my own show and give me FOMO.

26:53.800 --> 26:55.800
It's the 9th of June, by the way.

26:55.800 --> 26:57.160
So everyone put that in your calendar

26:57.160 --> 26:59.860
if you're around London, the 9th of June this year.

26:59.860 --> 27:00.700
Very good.

27:00.700 --> 27:03.780
The 9th of June, 2018 for a drunken mashup

27:03.780 --> 27:05.980
of a bunch of different Linux podcasters.

27:05.980 --> 27:09.320
And go say hi to Mr. Popey, he smells great.

27:09.320 --> 27:10.800
And so it's always a pleasure to bump into him.

27:10.800 --> 27:12.360
Joe, thanks for popping on real quick

27:12.360 --> 27:13.360
and setting me straight,

27:13.360 --> 27:15.000
because I was going to blow that.

27:16.400 --> 27:17.240
Yeah, no worries.

27:17.240 --> 27:18.060
I am out and about.

27:18.060 --> 27:19.200
That's why I sound a bit different.

27:19.200 --> 27:20.440
Yeah, no, I still appreciate it.

27:20.440 --> 27:21.280
All right.

27:21.280 --> 27:24.880
Well, so then, of course, there's the next event,

27:24.880 --> 27:28.160
the granddaddy event that always gets a lot of attention.

27:28.160 --> 27:29.800
And this is the last one I'm going to mention this week

27:29.800 --> 27:30.980
before we get to Barton.

27:30.980 --> 27:35.800
And that is Scale16x, March 8th through the 11th

27:35.800 --> 27:39.240
at the Pasadena Convention Center in California,

27:39.240 --> 27:42.160
which has a new vibe this year.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.840
They're kind of really trying to push a new vibe.

27:43.840 --> 27:45.240
They wanted to make sure I knew about it.

27:45.240 --> 27:47.760
They wanted to make sure that late night Linux knew about it.

27:47.760 --> 27:52.560
So they sent us information about a Libre photo workshop

27:52.560 --> 27:55.600
that's coming up and even a photography walk

27:55.600 --> 27:58.160
around Pasadena, which actually would be kind of legit.

27:58.160 --> 27:59.120
If you're going to Pasadena,

27:59.120 --> 28:00.600
why not go out for a photography walk?

28:00.600 --> 28:02.600
That actually sounds kind of worth it,

28:02.600 --> 28:03.760
because you could always use a walk

28:03.760 --> 28:05.480
and it's kind of a beautiful area.

28:05.480 --> 28:08.960
And so they're focusing in for at least one of the tracks

28:08.960 --> 28:13.320
on Libre-free tools to work with graphics.

28:13.320 --> 28:14.720
And they're going to bring a collection of artists,

28:14.720 --> 28:17.760
projects, developers, and just, you know, users

28:17.760 --> 28:20.360
that just want to make the best possible-looking art

28:20.360 --> 28:21.840
on a free desktop.

28:21.840 --> 28:24.640
So Libre Graphics at Scale is going to present talks

28:24.640 --> 28:27.520
designed for general audience of users and developers.

28:27.520 --> 28:29.180
They're going to vary in subject matter from tutorials

28:29.180 --> 28:33.880
and workflows to project announcements and packaging.

28:33.880 --> 28:37.080
Specifically, that'll be Friday the 9th of March

28:37.080 --> 28:39.720
from 10 a.m. to 1700.

28:39.720 --> 28:43.280
The 16th Annual Southern California Linux Expo.

28:43.280 --> 28:45.280
Anybody in the Mamba Room planning to go?

28:47.520 --> 28:48.360
Really?

28:48.360 --> 28:49.920
Just me?

28:49.920 --> 28:50.760
That's so sad.

28:50.760 --> 28:52.320
I don't know what's thinking about going.

28:52.320 --> 28:55.400
Well, you know, I don't know exactly.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.440
I haven't fully figured it out, but I think I'm going.

28:57.440 --> 29:00.360
I have trouble getting vacation time, so yeah.

29:00.360 --> 29:02.080
Yeah, my boss makes me go.

29:02.080 --> 29:02.920
So.

29:02.920 --> 29:03.760
Ha ha.

29:03.760 --> 29:07.360
We'll be at a company thing in Budapest,

29:07.360 --> 29:09.000
so it'll be difficult for us to go.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.560
Oh yeah, okay.

29:10.560 --> 29:11.440
All right.

29:11.440 --> 29:12.560
Okay, I'll be lonely there.

29:12.560 --> 29:13.440
But you know, I'll just hang out

29:13.440 --> 29:14.360
with all my other Linux friends.

29:14.360 --> 29:15.200
That's fine.

29:15.200 --> 29:16.840
You guys just make it a good party.

29:16.840 --> 29:17.800
That's cool.

29:17.800 --> 29:20.000
We ought to just sync up our schedules ahead of time.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.060
We just get a Google Calendar,

29:21.060 --> 29:22.240
so that way I can make sure I'm always

29:22.240 --> 29:23.080
wherever you are, Poppy.

29:23.080 --> 29:25.240
That's really what I want to go for.

29:25.240 --> 29:28.820
So you can find out more at sociallinuxexpo.org.

29:28.820 --> 29:30.800
That is for scale 16.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.680
And I'm going to be there in some capacity,

29:32.680 --> 29:34.740
there with Noah doing our thing,

29:34.740 --> 29:36.920
trying to pull him constantly away from all the ham guys.

29:36.920 --> 29:37.800
That's what Noah does.

29:37.800 --> 29:40.440
Noah goes there, he gets a feel for the layout,

29:40.440 --> 29:41.480
and then he just goes and hangs out

29:41.480 --> 29:42.440
with the ham guys all the time.

29:42.440 --> 29:44.600
Because they've got the cool toys, they really do.

29:44.600 --> 29:45.480
And they're proud of it.

29:45.480 --> 29:48.840
So it's actually kind of a blast.

29:48.840 --> 29:50.240
Let's get Barton on.

29:50.240 --> 29:54.600
The XPS 13 is, it's kind of this strange beast.

29:54.600 --> 29:55.980
Because if you just go out on the web

29:55.980 --> 29:57.680
and Google search XPS 13,

29:57.680 --> 30:00.420
you get something that runs Windows 10.

30:01.720 --> 30:02.760
It's probably not what you're looking for

30:02.760 --> 30:04.400
if you're listening to this show.

30:04.400 --> 30:06.480
But you've heard that there is,

30:06.480 --> 30:08.880
there is specifically a version of it that runs Ubuntu.

30:08.880 --> 30:10.060
We've talked about it many times.

30:10.060 --> 30:12.080
I've done reviews in the past.

30:12.080 --> 30:14.160
Went down there to Dell last year,

30:14.160 --> 30:17.240
got kind of my eyes on all of the different products,

30:17.240 --> 30:19.500
including things outside the XPS line.

30:19.500 --> 30:22.640
And so there's this sort of Skunk Works project

30:22.640 --> 30:24.960
called the Sputnik project that we've covered on and off

30:24.960 --> 30:26.820
that's been brewing in the background.

30:26.820 --> 30:30.080
And it's been getting more and more prominence

30:30.080 --> 30:31.520
at dell.com too.

30:31.520 --> 30:34.160
Like now, today, if you go to dell.com slash developers,

30:34.160 --> 30:36.680
or dell.com slash Sputnik, you find it right away.

30:36.680 --> 30:37.520
There was a period in time

30:37.520 --> 30:40.120
where it was kind of like buried on the Dell website.

30:40.120 --> 30:41.200
It was like, wasn't clear.

30:41.200 --> 30:42.820
Is this something they're really into?

30:42.820 --> 30:46.320
But we are now seven releases,

30:46.320 --> 30:47.160
the seventh generation,

30:47.160 --> 30:49.560
we're seven releases into this product line.

30:50.500 --> 30:53.160
Over five years now into this product line.

30:53.160 --> 30:55.760
And they've been iterating on it over and over

30:55.760 --> 30:56.640
and over again.

30:56.640 --> 30:59.940
And so last week, middle of last week, I think,

30:59.940 --> 31:04.860
they announced the new XPS 13 with eighth generation

31:04.860 --> 31:07.780
Intel processors and all of those goodies.

31:07.780 --> 31:11.280
So I wanted to bring Barton on to talk about it

31:11.280 --> 31:16.280
because I honestly, I expected Dell to blow it by now.

31:16.560 --> 31:20.160
I just thought, nothing good lasts forever.

31:20.160 --> 31:22.920
And they've been doing it for like five years.

31:22.920 --> 31:27.920
I just kind of thought, it's gonna slip, it's gonna slip.

31:28.160 --> 31:29.440
But they've proven me wrong.

31:29.440 --> 31:31.320
So when I saw the new release,

31:31.320 --> 31:33.480
I immediately fired off an email to Barton,

31:33.480 --> 31:34.360
said, come on the show.

31:34.360 --> 31:35.360
So before we go to Barton,

31:35.360 --> 31:37.960
let's stop right here and thank DigitalOcean

31:37.960 --> 31:41.320
for sponsoring the Unplugged program, DigitalOcean.com.

31:41.320 --> 31:43.080
You go over there, you create your account

31:43.080 --> 31:45.480
and then use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED, it's one word,

31:45.480 --> 31:46.520
and you get a $10 credit.

31:46.520 --> 31:48.280
And they've just recently adjusted their pricing

31:48.280 --> 31:49.800
to make it even more competitive.

31:49.800 --> 31:52.920
And they got a new website too that is gorgeous.

31:52.920 --> 31:55.080
DigitalOcean.com, create the account,

31:55.080 --> 31:58.140
use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED, and then go dig around.

31:58.140 --> 31:59.660
They got the best dashboard.

31:59.660 --> 32:03.120
Every other vendor in this area

32:03.120 --> 32:05.120
is attempting to rip them off

32:05.120 --> 32:06.200
and they can't even compete

32:06.200 --> 32:08.200
because DigitalOcean doesn't stand still.

32:08.200 --> 32:09.660
When they're not making their features better,

32:09.660 --> 32:13.340
when they're not adding things like monitoring or spaces,

32:13.340 --> 32:15.540
or when they're not doing those things,

32:15.540 --> 32:18.080
they're revving their website and they're revving their API

32:18.080 --> 32:20.360
or they're publishing amazing documentation.

32:20.360 --> 32:22.160
They just do not stand still.

32:22.160 --> 32:26.600
It's such a great service that anytime I wanna try out

32:26.600 --> 32:27.780
a new open source project these days,

32:27.780 --> 32:29.760
anything that's server-based at all,

32:29.760 --> 32:31.320
I don't even bother with a VM.

32:31.320 --> 32:33.260
I just go spin up a droplet in seconds.

32:33.260 --> 32:34.660
I've been talking about it this last couple of weeks,

32:34.660 --> 32:37.540
it just blows me away for Linux action news.

32:37.540 --> 32:38.980
Just over the weekend,

32:38.980 --> 32:41.480
I'm gonna try out NextCloud 13 for the weekend.

32:41.480 --> 32:42.320
Let's see how that goes.

32:42.320 --> 32:44.080
I'm just gonna try out NextCloud 13

32:44.080 --> 32:45.800
with the new NextCloud talk.

32:45.800 --> 32:47.400
I had that up and running in five minutes,

32:47.400 --> 32:49.160
but you're in a combination of 50,

32:49.160 --> 32:52.800
I think I would deploy in, I say usually 40 seconds,

32:52.800 --> 32:53.760
they say 55 seconds.

32:53.760 --> 32:55.240
I mean, it just spins up so damn fast,

32:55.240 --> 32:56.080
it almost doesn't matter.

32:56.080 --> 32:58.000
You get a system up and running, you pick the data center,

32:58.000 --> 32:59.600
they have data centers all over the world.

32:59.600 --> 33:03.800
I chose Ubuntu 16.04, I SSH into that sucker.

33:03.800 --> 33:06.120
I then immediately did a pseudo snap install

33:06.120 --> 33:08.080
NextCloud dash dash edge, I think it was,

33:08.080 --> 33:10.060
to get the NextCloud 13.

33:10.060 --> 33:12.000
So that was within, I don't know,

33:12.000 --> 33:15.080
two minutes of creating the create machine button.

33:15.080 --> 33:16.640
I was installing NextCloud 13,

33:16.640 --> 33:18.320
and then by minute three,

33:18.320 --> 33:20.120
I was pulling up my NextCloud,

33:20.120 --> 33:22.080
you know, the final configuration wizard

33:22.080 --> 33:23.720
in my web browser on my desktop

33:23.720 --> 33:25.220
off of a DigitalOcean droplet.

33:26.320 --> 33:27.600
And then I could do calls,

33:27.600 --> 33:29.840
and with DigitalOcean's incredible network speed,

33:29.840 --> 33:31.680
40 gigabits coming to those hypervisors,

33:31.680 --> 33:33.080
so I'm sitting there doing the,

33:33.080 --> 33:36.180
it just, it blew me away that I just,

33:36.180 --> 33:38.360
back in the day, I used to take,

33:38.360 --> 33:40.880
it took me two to three, sometimes a month,

33:40.880 --> 33:41.840
to get a new server.

33:41.840 --> 33:43.640
And now I can do it in five minutes,

33:43.640 --> 33:45.520
I have the whole damn thing set up.

33:45.520 --> 33:46.920
It's really incredible.

33:46.920 --> 33:48.440
They have cluster deployments,

33:48.440 --> 33:50.040
they have different kind of optimizations

33:50.040 --> 33:52.280
for different compute types, pre-build applications,

33:52.280 --> 33:54.760
or you build the whole thing from the ground up.

33:54.760 --> 33:57.200
It's really awesome, it's a really good service.

33:57.200 --> 33:58.480
DigitalOcean.com, try it out,

33:58.480 --> 34:00.880
and use our promo code DOUNPLUG.

34:00.880 --> 34:03.040
So we've got this new fancy XPS 13,

34:03.040 --> 34:04.640
there's only one thing to do.

34:04.640 --> 34:07.280
So joining me to talk about the new XPS 13

34:07.280 --> 34:09.700
is the horse's mouth, essentially.

34:09.700 --> 34:10.640
It's Mr. Barton George.

34:10.640 --> 34:12.720
Barton, welcome back to the show.

34:12.720 --> 34:14.240
Well, thank you, yes, horse's mouth.

34:14.240 --> 34:16.040
You don't mind if I call you a horse's mouth, do you?

34:16.040 --> 34:18.800
I love that one, I'm gonna put that on my business card.

34:18.800 --> 34:22.040
You know, it's not a comment on your physical appearance,

34:22.040 --> 34:24.720
it's just a comment on your authority on the topic.

34:24.720 --> 34:27.400
Oh, authoritarianism, yes, I like that.

34:27.400 --> 34:29.000
Well, there is one source I go to

34:29.000 --> 34:30.760
when there's a new developer edition,

34:30.760 --> 34:34.120
and it's your blog, and I don't know how you guys did it.

34:34.120 --> 34:35.880
I mean, you're supposed to be screwing this up by now,

34:35.880 --> 34:39.880
but it looks like the new, what is this, the seventh gen?

34:39.880 --> 34:42.960
XPS 13 is- Yeah, exactly, yeah, seventh gen.

34:42.960 --> 34:45.880
Knocking it out of the park, I'm impressed.

34:45.880 --> 34:47.080
Which is a bit confusing,

34:47.080 --> 34:51.000
because we're one behind the Intel generations.

34:51.000 --> 34:51.840
I wasn't gonna say it, but-

34:51.840 --> 34:53.800
Featuring the eighth generation.

34:53.800 --> 34:56.240
Yeah, and so people, I got that on Twitter,

34:56.240 --> 34:59.640
some people say, wait, shouldn't that be eighth generation?

34:59.640 --> 35:01.000
So. Now, you know what?

35:01.000 --> 35:03.120
I have a feeling with all of the Meltdown Inspector news,

35:03.120 --> 35:04.720
you may actually catch up eventually,

35:04.720 --> 35:05.800
or they'll catch you or something.

35:05.800 --> 35:08.440
And pass them, man, I think that's, you know.

35:08.440 --> 35:09.400
I think that's very likely.

35:09.400 --> 35:11.120
This will just set our sights low.

35:11.120 --> 35:13.960
Well, so the XPS 13, it's like the,

35:13.960 --> 35:15.800
it's the laptop in the Linux world

35:15.800 --> 35:18.240
that really needs no introduction anymore,

35:18.240 --> 35:19.840
which is a pretty remarkable achievement,

35:19.840 --> 35:21.960
if you think about it, and it's been around

35:21.960 --> 35:23.080
for how many years now?

35:23.080 --> 35:24.840
Is this the fifth or seventh year?

35:24.840 --> 35:27.040
Well, you know, the fifth anniversary

35:27.040 --> 35:28.960
was end of November last year,

35:28.960 --> 35:30.920
so that, and by fifth, I mean, anniversary,

35:30.920 --> 35:33.080
I mean, the first one came out then.

35:33.080 --> 35:36.560
We had about six or seven months before that,

35:36.560 --> 35:39.960
that we really flew to market with that,

35:39.960 --> 35:43.840
as far as going from PowerPoint to product.

35:43.840 --> 35:46.920
So, but yeah, we do the counting

35:46.920 --> 35:49.720
from the first product ship.

35:49.720 --> 35:50.960
Well, so- So five years.

35:50.960 --> 35:53.680
Still what seems like the best screen

35:53.680 --> 35:54.760
on any laptop in the market.

35:54.760 --> 35:57.040
I'm surprised that it's still just like,

35:57.040 --> 35:58.400
I mean, nobody really seems to be touching it.

35:58.400 --> 36:00.200
And it's not me that's even saying that anymore.

36:00.200 --> 36:01.280
You probably saw this,

36:01.280 --> 36:04.080
but Linus Torvalds posted on Google Plus

36:04.080 --> 36:07.120
that when he tried out all the different laptops

36:07.120 --> 36:08.920
in this category, the XPS 13,

36:08.920 --> 36:10.320
not only was it the one he went with,

36:10.320 --> 36:12.440
the developer edition, but he liked it so much

36:12.440 --> 36:15.080
that he also bought a second one for his daughter.

36:15.080 --> 36:16.400
So that's pretty high praise.

36:16.400 --> 36:17.880
I think he actually, I think it went,

36:17.880 --> 36:19.040
yeah, yeah, no, exactly, you're right.

36:19.040 --> 36:19.960
I do remember that.

36:19.960 --> 36:20.800
Yeah.

36:20.800 --> 36:22.400
Well, that kind of thing didn't go unnoticed by us,

36:22.400 --> 36:23.240
believe what you mean.

36:23.240 --> 36:24.080
I would imagine.

36:24.080 --> 36:26.760
So it really is the laptop that needs no introduction,

36:26.760 --> 36:29.960
but I'll be honest, you're supposed to screw it up eventually,

36:29.960 --> 36:31.160
but it just seems to be getting better.

36:31.160 --> 36:36.160
It's got an i7, what is it, 7,500U i7,

36:36.200 --> 36:39.680
all the way up to that, 16 gigs of RAM, 512 gig SSD,

36:39.680 --> 36:42.640
4K screen, under $2,000.

36:42.640 --> 36:43.880
Oh wait, it's got one terabyte option as well.

36:43.880 --> 36:44.920
Oh, okay.

36:44.920 --> 36:47.280
Okay, well that probably puts it over the $2,000 mark.

36:47.280 --> 36:51.240
But it starts around what, 900?

36:51.240 --> 36:52.920
So that's the entry price?

36:52.920 --> 36:53.760
Exactly, yeah.

36:53.760 --> 36:58.760
And I should also say we're keeping the previous one.

37:00.640 --> 37:05.200
So if you give them numbers, so one's the 9370,

37:05.200 --> 37:07.160
the other one is the 9360,

37:07.160 --> 37:09.080
and we don't use those numbers usually for marketing,

37:09.080 --> 37:11.080
but I use that.

37:11.080 --> 37:12.840
You can search on Google on those terms

37:12.840 --> 37:15.140
and the right ones will come up.

37:15.140 --> 37:20.140
Yes, also, if you go to dell.com and check on,

37:20.140 --> 37:25.140
I think you can look on Developer Edition or XPS 13,

37:26.700 --> 37:28.100
it'll show both of those.

37:28.100 --> 37:31.260
Ah, okay, and why are you guys keeping, why?

37:31.260 --> 37:33.780
As opposed to in the past where one has replaced the other.

37:33.780 --> 37:36.120
And that's, and you're asking why is that?

37:36.120 --> 37:39.380
And that's because they're at two different price points.

37:39.380 --> 37:40.560
They're not that far apart,

37:40.560 --> 37:42.380
but there are folks who are gonna say,

37:42.380 --> 37:44.480
hey, Quad Core, I don't really need that.

37:44.480 --> 37:46.720
I'd rather save the money and get something

37:46.720 --> 37:50.420
that is more appropriate for what I'm doing.

37:50.420 --> 37:53.580
Yeah, and the, I mean, I have a fifth generation

37:53.580 --> 37:54.580
XPS 13 Developer Edition.

37:54.580 --> 37:55.420
Oh, well, there you go.

37:55.420 --> 37:57.580
And it's still a great machine.

37:57.580 --> 37:59.460
So I could imagine the sixth generations

37:59.460 --> 38:01.560
would make a lot of people pretty happy.

38:02.460 --> 38:06.180
You also have a non-4K version with a 1080 screen.

38:06.180 --> 38:07.340
How well do those do?

38:07.340 --> 38:08.580
Do the 4K sell a lot better

38:08.580 --> 38:09.700
or are you selling more of the 1080s?

38:09.700 --> 38:11.140
Do you know, can you say?

38:11.140 --> 38:13.420
Well, you know, I don't have the actual split,

38:13.420 --> 38:14.900
but we get people who want, you know,

38:14.900 --> 38:17.540
I don't wanna drive a monitor that,

38:17.540 --> 38:20.340
that, you know, that kind of resolution.

38:20.340 --> 38:23.460
You know, the other thing is just tangentially,

38:23.460 --> 38:26.140
whatever we offer config wise,

38:26.140 --> 38:29.740
there's all these folks who say, dang, that's, you know,

38:29.740 --> 38:32.380
if I would have bought it, if it just had this config.

38:33.340 --> 38:35.780
And so that's one thing we're compiling is

38:36.860 --> 38:38.700
what are the configs that people are saying

38:38.700 --> 38:40.940
that they would want?

38:40.940 --> 38:42.500
You know, what combination?

38:42.500 --> 38:46.900
And then we'll go with, see if we can add it.

38:46.900 --> 38:49.180
Cause we get a time or two during the life cycle

38:49.180 --> 38:52.020
where we look at, well, does it make sense to drop

38:52.020 --> 38:57.020
or add a, what you call it, the config.

38:57.100 --> 38:59.740
And that's the point where we go and we look at the,

38:59.740 --> 39:01.700
how well is this selling versus that one?

39:01.700 --> 39:04.700
And so if you get one that's only selling 5%,

39:04.700 --> 39:05.820
you drop that and you think, okay,

39:05.820 --> 39:10.820
what else might be something that people would enjoy?

39:10.820 --> 39:15.180
So along those lines, I've noticed something

39:15.180 --> 39:17.300
that's actually the absence of something

39:17.300 --> 39:20.260
that you guys are doing and it has to be intentional.

39:20.260 --> 39:23.380
So I want to pick your brain about it because it's,

39:23.380 --> 39:25.780
no, it's something that I think other OEMs

39:25.780 --> 39:27.260
need to take a lesson from.

39:27.260 --> 39:32.260
And it's, when I get a Dell XPS 13 and I boot it up,

39:33.700 --> 39:37.780
it's not Dell, Buntu, it's not like a custom version

39:37.780 --> 39:40.300
of the Mate desktop that's been themed for Dell

39:40.300 --> 39:43.820
and has Chrome pre-installed and Eclipse IDE ready

39:43.820 --> 39:46.060
to develop and push applications to the cloud.

39:46.060 --> 39:48.660
It's just Ubuntu.

39:48.660 --> 39:51.760
It's about as vanilla with a few changes here and there

39:51.760 --> 39:54.140
that are probably just for like driver support or whatnot.

39:54.140 --> 39:56.020
I mean, it's obvious at this point

39:56.020 --> 39:57.500
that this is a very intentional decision.

39:57.500 --> 40:00.100
Can you talk about that a little bit?

40:00.100 --> 40:03.340
Yeah, I think in the beginning, although people did say

40:03.340 --> 40:05.780
when we're collecting initial feedback,

40:05.780 --> 40:07.660
we did get a lot of people, it was before we launched it,

40:07.660 --> 40:10.660
a lot of people saying, hey, I just want vanilla Ubuntu.

40:10.660 --> 40:13.340
But we thought, hey, we can really add some value here

40:13.340 --> 40:15.060
by doing a couple of things.

40:15.060 --> 40:17.580
We're going to pick the utilities and tools

40:17.580 --> 40:20.940
that people want most and we'll load those.

40:20.940 --> 40:24.300
And we'll also go and we're going to create this thing

40:24.300 --> 40:28.660
called the Cloud Launcher, which allows you to take LXE

40:28.660 --> 40:33.660
and take what you create on the laptop as a micro cloud

40:34.540 --> 40:36.420
and then push that out to the cloud.

40:36.420 --> 40:39.060
And we're going to do this thing called the Platform Launcher,

40:39.060 --> 40:43.660
which is going to allow you to take software stacks

40:43.660 --> 40:48.400
that are pre-created and load them up with dependencies,

40:48.400 --> 40:49.500
everything, get them good to go.

40:49.500 --> 40:51.940
I'm seeing other manufacturers do that currently.

40:51.940 --> 40:54.540
This is something they're embarking on.

40:54.540 --> 40:56.880
Yeah, and so we went down that path.

40:56.880 --> 41:00.300
What we found though was the utilities and tools,

41:00.300 --> 41:03.060
people really wanted to pick their own.

41:03.060 --> 41:05.580
That wasn't much value adds, we stopped that.

41:05.580 --> 41:10.220
The profile tool turned out to be a heck of a lot harder

41:10.220 --> 41:13.660
than we thought, and so that on top of the fact

41:13.660 --> 41:17.080
that we didn't have people clamoring for it,

41:18.420 --> 41:19.260
we put that aside.

41:19.260 --> 41:21.260
And then the case of the Cloud Launcher,

41:21.260 --> 41:24.420
serendipitously, this company called Docker came along

41:24.420 --> 41:27.500
and did what we were trying to do,

41:27.500 --> 41:29.380
is get a way to write the application

41:29.380 --> 41:33.300
that you have on your laptop and then get it to the cloud.

41:33.300 --> 41:37.380
So we started out with these grand ideas of value add

41:37.380 --> 41:38.940
that the customers would love,

41:38.940 --> 41:41.820
and in the end, we're at that vanilla point

41:41.820 --> 41:43.980
that you just mentioned.

41:43.980 --> 41:47.540
Interesting that the developer community

41:47.540 --> 41:51.220
seems to be of the mindset of if we want it,

41:51.220 --> 41:55.060
we'll just load it ourselves, which is less work for you.

41:55.060 --> 41:58.500
That's like the best, that's the best of, right?

41:58.500 --> 41:59.900
Oh yeah, no, exactly.

41:59.900 --> 42:01.300
That's interesting.

42:01.300 --> 42:05.280
I think just in general, just sort of zooming back,

42:06.240 --> 42:10.500
targeting this at the developer community has been great

42:10.500 --> 42:13.980
in that they offer lots of feedback.

42:13.980 --> 42:18.000
They also can, certain issues they can, or tweaks,

42:18.000 --> 42:20.660
they can work amongst themselves to do.

42:20.660 --> 42:25.660
And so as long as you speak honestly and are transparent,

42:25.660 --> 42:28.740
there's a lot of feedback and help

42:28.740 --> 42:30.540
that they're willing to give as well.

42:30.540 --> 42:34.540
Well, you know, one issue that comes to mind

42:34.540 --> 42:36.340
that it's the number one question I get

42:36.340 --> 42:41.340
when I review an XPS product, it's about the coil whine,

42:41.580 --> 42:46.580
which is not unique to the developer edition of the XPS 13.

42:47.740 --> 42:48.780
It's something that can happen

42:48.780 --> 42:51.100
because of just the, I would assume the compact electronics,

42:51.100 --> 42:52.420
but maybe you can talk about that.

42:52.420 --> 42:56.820
But it wasn't until I started reviewing it for Linux users

42:56.820 --> 42:58.820
that I started hearing about it all the time.

42:59.820 --> 43:00.660
Yep.

43:00.660 --> 43:02.180
So how is that in the new release?

43:02.180 --> 43:05.380
And were the Linux customer base

43:05.380 --> 43:06.980
or the developer customer base, as you put it,

43:06.980 --> 43:11.980
were they particularly demanding in that kind of issue

43:12.060 --> 43:14.060
in a way that the Windows users weren't?

43:15.020 --> 43:16.820
Like where does that all stand today?

43:16.820 --> 43:19.900
Well, I think, so, you know,

43:19.900 --> 43:24.660
well, I can't go into too much detail

43:24.660 --> 43:27.180
because it involves third parties, et cetera.

43:28.260 --> 43:30.940
And, you know, anything we say, oh, it's perfect now,

43:30.940 --> 43:32.860
and then somebody has an issue with it,

43:32.860 --> 43:33.700
that's not gonna look good.

43:33.700 --> 43:36.020
And somebody, no matter how perfect anything is,

43:36.020 --> 43:36.860
something's gonna come up.

43:36.860 --> 43:40.100
All right, so we got a big couch here, but I follow you.

43:40.100 --> 43:45.100
Yeah, yeah, no, I think it was a small subset of folks.

43:45.980 --> 43:49.620
That being said, if you were one of those lucky subsets,

43:49.620 --> 43:52.180
that wasn't a good thing.

43:52.180 --> 43:57.180
And I think too, there's also a tolerance level for people.

43:57.740 --> 43:59.660
So there's certain people that would,

44:01.900 --> 44:06.100
whose parameters were more acute than what we set.

44:06.100 --> 44:07.180
Sure.

44:07.180 --> 44:09.100
Say maybe you or I or somebody else

44:09.100 --> 44:10.500
would hear that same thing and say,

44:10.500 --> 44:12.860
oh, well, that just sort of sounds like

44:12.860 --> 44:14.740
what things normally sound like.

44:14.740 --> 44:15.860
And then there's other ones

44:15.860 --> 44:18.820
that were outside the normal boundary.

44:18.820 --> 44:20.860
And you'd say, oh, yeah, that makes sense.

44:21.980 --> 44:26.940
So, yes, we have taken steps to ameliorate that.

44:28.140 --> 44:33.140
And, you know, that's basically what I'll say at this point.

44:34.580 --> 44:38.700
Yeah, I understand, you know, I have a fifth gen

44:38.700 --> 44:41.220
and I reviewed the sixth gen

44:41.220 --> 44:43.660
and never had the problem myself.

44:44.700 --> 44:46.860
But I have worked extensively

44:46.860 --> 44:50.220
with small compact machines in audio production.

44:50.220 --> 44:52.580
And I know that it is an issue that can crop up.

44:52.580 --> 44:56.300
I've, for example, had three or four,

44:56.300 --> 44:58.900
three Intel NUCs actually hooked up to my mixer at one point

44:58.900 --> 45:01.220
and two of them exhibited coil winds

45:01.220 --> 45:03.740
and one of them didn't, same exact model.

45:03.740 --> 45:05.580
But it does sound like it's gotten worked on.

45:05.580 --> 45:07.340
I've been following some of the threads

45:07.340 --> 45:09.020
and I've been seeing people talking about it.

45:09.020 --> 45:10.060
It does seem like things have gotten better

45:10.060 --> 45:11.540
from what I can observe.

45:11.540 --> 45:14.620
I wonder though, down the road,

45:14.620 --> 45:18.700
is it, am I being over cautious

45:18.700 --> 45:21.820
when I worry that maybe Linux users are persnickety

45:21.820 --> 45:23.860
but they're too demanding?

45:23.860 --> 45:25.260
Like, it seems like maybe we're high maintenance

45:25.260 --> 45:26.340
or is it a good thing?

45:28.220 --> 45:30.420
You know, I think in general,

45:30.420 --> 45:32.100
and getting back to what I said a little while ago,

45:32.100 --> 45:36.580
as long as you treat developers fairly,

45:38.140 --> 45:43.140
they're okay with a certain amount of slack here and there.

45:43.140 --> 45:46.740
And I also find that oftentimes people have,

45:46.740 --> 45:49.820
you know, Linux users will joke themselves

45:49.820 --> 45:51.660
as, hey, we're willing to,

45:51.660 --> 45:55.500
I'm not saying courses in regards to anything we do, no,

45:55.500 --> 45:57.660
but they feel that, you know,

45:57.660 --> 45:59.180
things have been so tough for so long

45:59.180 --> 46:00.580
when things do get better,

46:00.580 --> 46:02.340
even if they're not 100% perfect,

46:02.340 --> 46:03.900
they're very happy about it.

46:03.900 --> 46:06.100
If things tend to be trending in the right direction

46:06.100 --> 46:08.260
and there seems to be steady progress,

46:08.260 --> 46:11.100
then yeah, I think you're absolutely correct.

46:11.100 --> 46:13.140
And I would say it's the opposite.

46:13.140 --> 46:17.020
Not that you're not gonna get somebody who is persnickety,

46:17.020 --> 46:18.100
but I think in general,

46:18.100 --> 46:22.940
the developer crowd seems to be much more understanding

46:22.940 --> 46:25.020
and willing to work with you

46:25.020 --> 46:27.420
as long as you're working in good faith,

46:27.420 --> 46:30.980
you're being honest about what's going on, et cetera.

46:30.980 --> 46:32.420
Well, let's see then, let's shift gears.

46:32.420 --> 46:34.860
And I think, I was just gonna say one thing too.

46:34.860 --> 46:37.860
Sometimes it's tricky, you know,

46:37.860 --> 46:40.380
with regards to honesty in that,

46:40.380 --> 46:42.820
or I shouldn't say honesty, but you always are honest,

46:42.820 --> 46:44.740
but as far as how much you reveal

46:44.740 --> 46:48.980
in that it involves other partners as well and players.

46:50.060 --> 46:51.580
And so you can't,

46:51.580 --> 46:53.820
and even if you wanted to come out and say,

46:53.820 --> 46:55.780
this is what's going on,

46:55.780 --> 46:58.060
it would involve other folks as well.

46:58.060 --> 47:01.260
Yeah, I think everybody gets that.

47:01.260 --> 47:02.580
Yeah, I think it's pretty understandable.

47:02.580 --> 47:04.260
Now, so let's shift gears

47:04.260 --> 47:05.940
and see if we can make things uncomfortable

47:05.940 --> 47:07.740
with a different partner, Canonical.

47:07.740 --> 47:09.020
Oh, please do. Obviously, yeah.

47:09.020 --> 47:11.580
Let's see if, yeah.

47:11.580 --> 47:14.020
Now, you and I were sitting in a room together

47:14.020 --> 47:15.340
the moment it was announced.

47:15.340 --> 47:17.420
In fact, I was the person that delivered the news to you

47:17.420 --> 47:19.700
that Canonical was dropping Unity 7

47:19.700 --> 47:21.900
and switching to the GNOME desktop.

47:21.900 --> 47:22.940
How has that-

47:22.940 --> 47:24.380
Switching back, back, back.

47:24.380 --> 47:25.220
Right, right.

47:25.220 --> 47:27.300
How has that been brewing inside internally?

47:27.300 --> 47:29.820
Because 1710's been out.

47:29.820 --> 47:32.580
I know that you're shipping 1604 currently still.

47:32.580 --> 47:34.420
Probably won't be shipping 1710 ever,

47:34.420 --> 47:36.300
because why would you when,

47:36.300 --> 47:38.300
especially with 1804 right around.

47:38.300 --> 47:41.940
Is 1804 looking like it's gonna ship on Dell products?

47:41.940 --> 47:45.020
Is GNOME desktop gonna ship on Dell products?

47:45.020 --> 47:47.140
What's your answer for that?

47:47.140 --> 47:48.540
I'll say that what we usually do

47:48.540 --> 47:52.260
is when we launch a new system,

47:52.260 --> 47:57.260
it comes with the LTS that is current at the time.

47:58.260 --> 47:59.460
Right, so we don't, like you said,

47:59.460 --> 48:00.660
we won't do a 1710.

48:00.660 --> 48:05.540
We won't do an 1810 or a, what's after 18?

48:05.540 --> 48:07.940
19, 1904 or something like that.

48:07.940 --> 48:10.500
We only do, no, we do best efforts

48:11.580 --> 48:13.620
and we try to support people

48:13.620 --> 48:16.220
with issues they have in the interim releases,

48:16.220 --> 48:19.300
but the one that we're gonna guarantee

48:19.300 --> 48:22.180
is the LTS that ships with it.

48:23.540 --> 48:25.180
I mean, just, you don't even have to,

48:25.180 --> 48:26.340
not even talking about Dell,

48:26.340 --> 48:28.740
but just like your personal opinion,

48:28.740 --> 48:30.540
shipping a Linux desktop now for a while,

48:30.540 --> 48:32.500
working on this.

48:32.500 --> 48:33.740
How is Bart and George feeling

48:33.740 --> 48:35.180
about the transition to GNOME?

48:35.180 --> 48:39.180
Well, so without knowing all the intricacies,

48:39.180 --> 48:40.980
because I'm sure there's all sorts of things,

48:40.980 --> 48:42.180
oh, you didn't think about this

48:42.180 --> 48:44.020
and realize how it affects that.

48:44.020 --> 48:46.180
But it does seem like a big switch for some,

48:46.180 --> 48:48.620
it really does affect a product you're shipping.

48:49.660 --> 48:52.620
It does, and I think one thing is,

48:52.620 --> 48:55.060
as a company, you need to know

48:55.060 --> 48:57.860
when to hold them and when to fold them.

48:57.860 --> 49:00.340
Because one thing happens,

49:00.340 --> 49:01.420
and I've been in other companies

49:01.420 --> 49:04.780
that just keep pouring money into things,

49:04.780 --> 49:06.860
long after it became obvious

49:06.860 --> 49:11.860
that it wasn't great benefit to the customer at that time,

49:11.860 --> 49:14.900
and it really wouldn't be going forward.

49:14.900 --> 49:17.860
And yet, there is this desire sometimes

49:17.860 --> 49:19.580
to keep working at something

49:19.580 --> 49:24.580
long after it's been obvious that it's not the right move.

49:24.580 --> 49:26.460
So I think it's, and it's always tough.

49:26.460 --> 49:30.140
I mean, I say it as if that's an easy thing to do,

49:30.140 --> 49:33.620
but I do have a lot of respect for companies

49:33.620 --> 49:38.460
that early on say, you know what, this isn't gonna happen,

49:38.460 --> 49:39.780
we're gonna stop it.

49:41.180 --> 49:43.540
And so that's sort of the bigger picture.

49:43.540 --> 49:46.860
And so within that, put that lens on it,

49:46.860 --> 49:51.420
I think it made sense to realize they had an awesome vision,

49:51.420 --> 49:53.340
they'd done quite a bit of work,

49:54.820 --> 49:59.820
and it just, they weren't gonna get there to the end.

49:59.820 --> 50:02.500
They weren't gonna get there to the end.

50:02.500 --> 50:05.820
There seems to me, Barton, to be a similarity

50:05.820 --> 50:09.100
between what Canonical has done with their desktop.

50:09.100 --> 50:10.980
They went to Hacker News and other places,

50:10.980 --> 50:12.820
they said, what do you want out of Ubuntu?

50:12.820 --> 50:15.740
And people said, just ship stock GNOME,

50:15.740 --> 50:17.940
just give me my basic applications.

50:17.940 --> 50:19.860
Sort of reminds me of what people said to Dell

50:19.860 --> 50:21.860
when they said, just ship stock Ubuntu,

50:21.860 --> 50:23.580
just give me vanilla Ubuntu,

50:23.580 --> 50:25.780
I just wanna load my own applications.

50:25.780 --> 50:27.060
You see a similarity there?

50:27.060 --> 50:29.900
Yeah, and I think it's, you know, once again,

50:29.900 --> 50:31.500
it's does it add value or not?

50:31.500 --> 50:33.220
Are you just putting bells and whistles

50:33.220 --> 50:34.580
that nobody cares about,

50:34.580 --> 50:36.460
and it comes across as bloatware.

50:38.140 --> 50:40.340
So, yeah, I would see that,

50:40.340 --> 50:43.100
that there are certain things that are gonna be value add,

50:43.100 --> 50:47.100
but oftentimes in the Linux world,

50:47.100 --> 50:50.380
it's stuff that you're gonna pull down yourself,

50:50.380 --> 50:54.020
as opposed to if you're buying a Windows PC,

50:54.020 --> 50:57.500
having certain applications bundled with it

50:57.500 --> 51:00.940
really increases the value of the system.

51:00.940 --> 51:03.420
Now, before I let you go,

51:03.420 --> 51:05.780
I have to ask you something that you're not gonna have

51:05.780 --> 51:08.620
an answer to because you're not the processor guy,

51:08.620 --> 51:10.060
but I kinda have a tangential question.

51:10.060 --> 51:10.900
42.

51:10.900 --> 51:12.460
Right, okay, answered.

51:12.460 --> 51:13.660
No, thank you.

51:13.660 --> 51:15.940
If I, do you know, is this assumption correct?

51:15.940 --> 51:18.260
If I am a Dell XPS 13 user,

51:19.300 --> 51:21.820
running the Ubuntu that was installed on there

51:21.820 --> 51:23.260
when I got the machine,

51:23.260 --> 51:24.700
am I likely eventually gonna be able

51:24.700 --> 51:26.020
to just open up GNOME software

51:26.020 --> 51:28.140
and get microcode updates for meltdown?

51:28.140 --> 51:30.140
I know you might not know the intricacies

51:30.140 --> 51:30.980
of how it's gonna get patched,

51:30.980 --> 51:35.500
but the firmware delivery mechanism through GNOME software

51:35.500 --> 51:38.820
is something that Dell has gotten uniquely good at,

51:38.820 --> 51:42.420
and I wonder if, what I'm trying to get at is,

51:42.420 --> 51:44.380
how much awareness does it have

51:44.380 --> 51:46.580
at the Barton George level, this functionality?

51:46.580 --> 51:48.580
Like, how much of a topic of a conversation

51:48.580 --> 51:50.060
is this particular feature?

51:50.060 --> 51:52.860
Because it seems hyper important right now.

51:52.860 --> 51:55.860
The firmware updating through GNOME software,

51:55.860 --> 51:58.380
that working with fwupd, sorry to be vague,

51:58.380 --> 51:59.940
but that's a specific question.

51:59.940 --> 52:01.340
How much is that at your level?

52:01.340 --> 52:05.020
So, hardly any at all, right?

52:05.020 --> 52:10.020
So we have folks that are knee-deep

52:10.220 --> 52:13.060
in everything Ubuntu and working on all this,

52:13.060 --> 52:14.620
and yes, they would be,

52:14.620 --> 52:17.420
we have folks like that on the team,

52:17.420 --> 52:22.420
but my role as chief plate spinner doesn't go that far, so.

52:25.180 --> 52:27.340
Does it come up though, the feature,

52:27.340 --> 52:30.300
as a topic of conversation, or is it essentially,

52:30.300 --> 52:32.500
is it just an assumed, baked-in thing now?

52:34.340 --> 52:36.300
So I can't answer that specifically,

52:36.300 --> 52:40.500
not meaning that I'm not allowed to, but I just don't know,

52:40.500 --> 52:43.100
and I know, because there's a separate team.

52:43.100 --> 52:45.420
As you can imagine, technical meetings,

52:45.420 --> 52:48.260
internally about how we, what are we doing with Ubuntu

52:48.260 --> 52:50.620
as far as, from a technical point of view.

52:50.620 --> 52:52.420
Because it also involves your server products

52:52.420 --> 52:56.500
and not just the XPS 13, so I totally get it.

52:56.500 --> 52:58.540
The reason I wanted to ask is because the one thing

52:58.540 --> 52:59.820
the audience are gonna say after this interview

52:59.820 --> 53:01.700
is how come you didn't ask about Meltdown or Spectre?

53:01.700 --> 53:03.740
And so I had to try to get as close to something

53:03.740 --> 53:05.620
I thought you'd be able to answer in that regard,

53:05.620 --> 53:06.940
unless you wanna talk about-

53:06.940 --> 53:08.580
Yeah, I understand, we put it in bite-sized chunks,

53:08.580 --> 53:10.500
but the answer is, yeah, I don't know.

53:10.500 --> 53:13.820
I mean, if you wanna get into x86 architecture new ones,

53:13.820 --> 53:15.620
is with me, I mean, we could do it, but it doesn't seem

53:15.620 --> 53:18.740
like that'd probably be either one of our power areas.

53:18.740 --> 53:21.300
I was hoping we'd get into the Spark chip, really,

53:21.300 --> 53:26.300
I think, or the old RISC MIP chips.

53:26.300 --> 53:28.180
Right, right, absolutely.

53:28.180 --> 53:33.180
That's here is coming into my eye right now as I think back.

53:33.660 --> 53:36.100
So what trends is Barton George watching

53:36.100 --> 53:38.660
in the Linux world that he thinks will be something

53:38.660 --> 53:41.940
that Dell needs to respond to in the nearish term future?

53:41.940 --> 53:46.940
Oh, gosh, putting me on the spot.

53:46.940 --> 53:49.780
Yeah, it's sort of like, put your strategy hat on.

53:51.180 --> 53:53.540
Well, I think for us, it's much more,

53:53.540 --> 53:58.540
you go back to that, what is the customer looking for?

53:58.540 --> 54:03.540
And we just take what's out there and make sure it runs

54:04.420 --> 54:06.700
without a hitch on our system.

54:06.700 --> 54:09.940
So where Dell is looking at is, okay,

54:09.940 --> 54:12.020
how do we make, from a hardware point of view,

54:12.020 --> 54:16.540
how do we make systems that are continuously better

54:16.540 --> 54:18.300
for our customers?

54:18.300 --> 54:20.940
And then given that, how do we work,

54:20.940 --> 54:23.340
take what's out there in Linux

54:23.340 --> 54:26.380
and make it work on the laptops?

54:26.380 --> 54:31.380
So I think we're much closer focused in,

54:31.380 --> 54:35.180
also because, as I said, that's a lot of the stuff

54:35.180 --> 54:38.620
that the customers in particular will do

54:38.620 --> 54:41.140
and will decide on their own.

54:41.140 --> 54:46.140
Do you have any sense of what Linux could do better

54:46.580 --> 54:49.660
to be more successful in large corporations

54:49.660 --> 54:52.300
as an actual viable desktop OS?

54:52.300 --> 54:54.260
Is it just, is it an application issue?

54:54.260 --> 54:56.180
Take Dell, for example.

54:56.180 --> 54:57.780
If even if you're, Dell, you have to,

54:57.780 --> 54:58.980
even if you have a Linux machine,

54:58.980 --> 55:00.740
you still at some point, you functionally need

55:00.740 --> 55:03.340
a Windows machine to fully participate on the network.

55:03.340 --> 55:06.540
Is that an entrenched, irretractable position

55:06.540 --> 55:08.940
that Windows has etched out?

55:08.940 --> 55:12.180
Or sitting at your desk at Dell,

55:12.180 --> 55:14.820
could you foresee a day when even corporations

55:14.820 --> 55:16.660
as large as Dell could be shipping Linux

55:16.660 --> 55:18.060
on all of their desktops?

55:19.700 --> 55:23.900
Well, I think I'll answer that some of the key things

55:23.900 --> 55:25.780
that are missing is you got internal apps, right?

55:25.780 --> 55:30.740
Whether they're name tools or your expense reports,

55:30.740 --> 55:34.340
et cetera, that need to be done.

55:34.340 --> 55:37.180
They need to be rewritten if they're gonna be a Linux.

55:37.180 --> 55:38.100
Right, exactly.

55:38.100 --> 55:42.140
And so there's all that, as well as,

55:42.140 --> 55:46.460
as you say, we as many large companies run on Windows

55:46.460 --> 55:48.380
and we need to have all those applications.

55:48.380 --> 55:52.380
And so, for right now, they're great developer boxes

55:52.380 --> 55:55.540
within ourselves, as you say, within a large corporation,

55:55.540 --> 55:59.540
but they aren't general purpose machines.

55:59.540 --> 56:02.460
So that, I think that's gonna be tough

56:02.460 --> 56:04.940
that you're gonna need to sort of,

56:04.940 --> 56:06.340
at least to begin with,

56:07.220 --> 56:11.060
figure out what use cases you can pick

56:11.060 --> 56:16.060
and you don't wanna overestimate the power of Linux

56:16.980 --> 56:19.140
to supplant everything else.

56:19.140 --> 56:21.980
So don't overshoot, maybe?

56:21.980 --> 56:25.140
Because here's what I was kind of angling to is,

56:26.780 --> 56:30.580
is perhaps the strategy, or whatever you wanna call it,

56:30.580 --> 56:32.540
or perhaps should the goal be, maybe the goal post

56:32.540 --> 56:36.060
should now be a niche of the market

56:36.060 --> 56:40.220
that is large and growing and sophisticated?

56:40.220 --> 56:42.300
And should the discussion be more about

56:42.300 --> 56:45.460
retooling our desktops like GNOME

56:45.460 --> 56:49.180
to super serve a more sophisticated developer type audience?

56:49.180 --> 56:53.060
And maybe it's worth, stop chasing that

56:53.060 --> 56:56.700
total new computer user, that fantasy Linux user.

56:56.700 --> 56:59.220
Because it does seem like if we double down,

56:59.220 --> 57:02.340
if the Linux community could pull a Sputnik project

57:02.340 --> 57:03.180
and sort of just say,

57:03.180 --> 57:05.660
what would we build just for developers?

57:05.660 --> 57:07.380
We might have a lot of success there.

57:07.380 --> 57:08.220
What do you think?

57:09.180 --> 57:11.300
Yeah, no, I think that's what it's all about

57:11.300 --> 57:15.220
is sticking to your knitting, as they say.

57:15.220 --> 57:18.580
So it's not the, it's iterative, right?

57:18.580 --> 57:21.700
You start small, you're agile,

57:21.700 --> 57:23.540
you see what works and what doesn't work.

57:23.540 --> 57:27.540
As opposed to, by the year 20, what are we in now?

57:27.540 --> 57:30.020
2022, we're gonna be all 100% Linux

57:30.020 --> 57:33.780
on the desktop in our enterprise.

57:33.780 --> 57:36.500
And it's looking to expand beyond that.

57:36.500 --> 57:40.940
But as you say, the obvious targets to begin with

57:40.940 --> 57:44.580
are how can we do a developer machine

57:44.580 --> 57:46.900
that keeps meeting more of the developer needs,

57:46.900 --> 57:51.900
developers needs, or scientists, engineering scientists.

57:52.020 --> 57:57.020
Might we make a machine learning AI developer box

57:57.020 --> 57:58.940
that would have all those goodies,

57:58.940 --> 58:00.100
whatever those might be.

58:00.100 --> 58:00.940
Right.

58:01.820 --> 58:03.540
Or do you find out, once again, that it's,

58:03.540 --> 58:05.500
hey, whatever I want, I'll pull down myself

58:05.500 --> 58:09.740
so I don't need anything tailored to learning it.

58:09.740 --> 58:11.500
What we're kind of getting is,

58:11.500 --> 58:13.260
these users are generally capable enough

58:13.260 --> 58:15.100
of customizing their own system

58:15.100 --> 58:16.460
for their particular edge case

58:16.460 --> 58:19.100
if you give them the right base.

58:19.100 --> 58:21.020
So take machine learning and AI.

58:21.020 --> 58:23.660
That's a different machine than an XPS 13,

58:23.660 --> 58:26.140
but it's a type of machine that Dell certainly does sell.

58:26.140 --> 58:28.940
And if you could tune that right,

58:28.940 --> 58:30.980
give them the platform or the tool,

58:30.980 --> 58:33.300
and then they take care of the software side of it.

58:33.300 --> 58:36.300
And so maybe you get really good at doing that

58:36.300 --> 58:37.580
for a couple of markets.

58:37.580 --> 58:38.820
And then once you've really nailed that,

58:38.820 --> 58:40.140
you move on to another market.

58:40.140 --> 58:41.140
And then you nail that one.

58:41.140 --> 58:42.300
Yeah, exactly.

58:42.300 --> 58:46.140
And you look at what is value add in that area?

58:46.140 --> 58:48.380
Just like we said, when we originally went out with this

58:48.380 --> 58:52.620
and asked people what they wanted, they did say vanilla.

58:52.620 --> 58:53.620
And like I said, then we said,

58:53.620 --> 58:56.260
well, no, no, but we'll even give you more than vanilla.

58:56.260 --> 58:58.020
We'll give you all sorts of swirls

58:58.020 --> 58:59.580
and chocolate chunks in there.

59:00.660 --> 59:03.740
But yeah, to find out, say, once again, machine learning

59:03.740 --> 59:06.980
or people in the music industry or whatever it might be,

59:06.980 --> 59:10.340
what would you see as something that would be,

59:10.340 --> 59:12.460
that would make your life easier or better

59:12.460 --> 59:15.460
if we could provide it?

59:15.460 --> 59:20.380
Now, my last question is crystalline silica material?

59:21.700 --> 59:22.540
Wow.

59:22.540 --> 59:23.860
Now you're very gracious.

59:23.860 --> 59:26.700
This isn't, no, this is the quote.

59:26.700 --> 59:29.500
You would know because all retweets are,

59:29.500 --> 59:30.940
you fully support them.

59:30.940 --> 59:33.980
You retweeted a quote right here, not painted white.

59:33.980 --> 59:37.420
The new Dell XPS, don't get this wrong, everybody.

59:37.420 --> 59:38.620
It is not white.

59:38.620 --> 59:41.620
It is made of crystalline silica material

59:41.620 --> 59:44.580
that literally weaves the white color in like fabric

59:44.580 --> 59:47.220
in nine composite layers.

59:48.500 --> 59:50.300
Yeah, no, I tell you.

59:50.300 --> 59:52.300
You must be watching my tweets very carefully.

59:52.300 --> 59:54.500
You retweeted that, I don't know.

59:54.500 --> 59:55.500
Well, I'm on there right now.

59:55.500 --> 59:56.740
I'm on there right now, yeah.

59:56.740 --> 59:57.820
Okay, there you go.

59:57.820 --> 01:00:00.580
At Barton808, I go there every day, at Barton808,

01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:02.420
and all of our audience should too.

01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:04.620
Because if I were a betting man, dear audience,

01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:06.340
I would bet that there may be an update

01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:07.980
along the precision line soon,

01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:09.500
and that's one of my favorite lines.

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:12.540
So keep an eye out at Barton808.

01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:15.900
I can never, I can neither confirm nor deny wink wink.

01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:18.620
Of course not, of course not, yes.

01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:20.740
And of course you saw when I retweeted that,

01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:23.420
I also put in the shameless plug for the developer edition.

01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:25.460
Yes, of course, good man, good man.

01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:26.300
Yeah, we'll have links to-

01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:29.100
It wasn't so much about what they said, it was just, hey.

01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:30.500
A chance to plug your stuff.

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:33.420
As you should, as you should.

01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:36.660
The XPS 13 is, so like Barton said,

01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:39.760
available now in the 6th gen and 7th gen model.

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:40.980
The 7th gen is hot.

01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:44.140
It's the 93070, not hot literally,

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:47.300
but hot like in the, you know, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:48.260
With lots of different configs,

01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:50.940
I will link to bartongeorge.io in the show notes

01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:51.820
where you guys can read about it

01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:53.460
as well as the other product pages.

01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:54.940
Barton, is there anything else we want to mention

01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:56.300
before we roll out of here?

01:00:57.340 --> 01:01:00.380
No, I think that the one thing that I would say is,

01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:03.380
I was completely blown away by the amount of interest

01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:05.860
generated by this release.

01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:06.700
Oh yeah.

01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:08.120
Because as you know, it's number seven,

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:10.740
and I thought it would be incrementally, you know,

01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:12.940
or same sort of level of interest.

01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:17.200
And I got more hits on my blog that first day

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:20.300
than I have in 10 years that I've been doing that blog.

01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:23.860
So it was just, it was not what I expected.

01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:25.700
As I said, I expected people to be interested

01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:28.500
because we have folks who are interested in it.

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:29.980
But, you know, I'm glad to hear that.

01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:31.540
It doesn't surprise me a single bit, Barton,

01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:34.820
because, you know, the reason I drove my RV

01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:36.860
down to your office was because I could tell

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:39.820
there was momentum building around this product line,

01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:41.900
which snapped my attention around.

01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:45.300
And so I am not surprised to see it's continuing to build

01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:48.140
because I could, I could smell it coming, Barton.

01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:50.080
I could, like an Austin barbecue.

01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:54.340
What was it, your bunions were tweeting

01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:55.180
or something like that?

01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:56.000
You knew it was going to rain?

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:56.840
I don't know.

01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:59.140
I'm not sure, I'm not sure.

01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:01.540
Right now, I'm just thinking about Austin barbecue

01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:02.380
now that I said that.

01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:05.020
But Barton, thank you very much for coming on.

01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:06.220
And a pleasure as always.

01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:07.980
I really appreciate the opportunity, Chris.

01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:10.500
Maybe one of these, maybe one of these short weeks here,

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:11.580
I can get my hands on one of these

01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:12.860
and tell the folks what I think.

01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:15.220
But in the meantime, they can go read up about it.

01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:17.660
And I'll retweet new reviews for the developer edition

01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:18.500
I see coming along too,

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:19.940
so people can keep an eye out for that.

01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:20.780
All right, Barton.

01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:21.780
And then as we were talking about before,

01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:24.300
easiest way to get there is either,

01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:27.220
well, easiest to remember is dell.com slash developers

01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:29.460
or dell.com slash Sputnik.

01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:30.660
They'll take you to the same place

01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:31.860
and that's where it has the line

01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:35.760
and you can click through for the new one or the other ones.

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:38.180
You know, I never even got to ask Barton about his dogs.

01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:39.260
I was going to ask him about his dogs

01:02:39.260 --> 01:02:41.180
because somehow I go down to Dell,

01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:42.620
I hang out with Barton for a week

01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:44.220
and I didn't even know he was a dog owner.

01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:45.860
And now these days, that's all I care about

01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:46.700
is a new dog owner.

01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:48.980
But I digress, let's move on.

01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:50.980
We still have some great emails to get to.

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:54.220
I want to recap something that we've covered

01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:56.920
back in 2016 on this show and things have changed.

01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:59.060
I've been doing a head to head comparison recently.

01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:00.340
So I want to cover that.

01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:03.960
We've also got some quote unquote breaking news

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:06.240
from the Ubuntu Mate project all to come.

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:08.400
So let's take a moment and thank Linux Academy

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:09.960
for sponsoring the unplugged program.

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:13.020
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:15.220
Go there to sign up for a free seven day trial

01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:16.060
and support the show.

01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:17.620
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:18.700
What, what, what?

01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:20.300
You don't know what Linux Academy is?

01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:22.400
Friends, let me tell you this.

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:25.060
Well, actually, how about a highly paid voice actor

01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:26.000
will tell you.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.820
Whether you're an experienced sys admin

01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:30.980
or new to the world of Linux, Azure and AWS,

01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:33.660
OpenStack and DevOps, a sharp skillset

01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:36.180
is an absolute necessity to succeed.

01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:38.920
Meet Linux Academy, an online Linux

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:42.000
and cloud training platform that uses self-paced

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.180
video courses and hands-on labs

01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:46.180
to give you real world experience

01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:48.180
for a wide range of skills.

01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:49.780
Train for your certification,

01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:51.660
learn the latest DevOps tools

01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:54.020
and grow your skillset to do better work.

01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:56.860
Linux Academy is not just a video library.

01:03:56.860 --> 01:03:59.700
Our scenario-based server labs and quiz system

01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:01.740
allow you to learn hands-on.

01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:04.080
We also have full-time human instructors

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:07.300
who answer questions and help you earn that certification

01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:08.820
or promotion at work.

01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:10.560
We add new training every week

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:13.340
so you'll always be up to date on the latest tech.

use Linux Academy to stay on the bleeding edge

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:20.060
of the Linux ecosystem.

01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:21.780
You should too.

01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:23.820
One thing the voiceover guy doesn't mention

01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:25.860
that's my favorite feature of Linux Academy

01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:28.100
is they have full-time human beings

01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:29.540
that are available to help you if you get stuck,

01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:31.940
like instructors that really know the content material.

01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:34.100
And they have a course scheduler system

01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:35.860
specifically for us busy folk.

01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:38.940
Just the more you know, guys, the more you know.

01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:41.780
So go check it out, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:43.500
Learn how to build a secure system

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:46.100
so that way when the hackers are dropping malware

01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:47.740
on your system, you're on top of it.

01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:48.580
Why are you laughing?

01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:51.580
The hackers are dropping malware into your system.

01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:54.140
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:55.980
And a big thank you to Linux Academy

01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:57.460
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

01:04:57.460 --> 01:05:01.820
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:04.660
So Wimpy, I heard a little birdie tell me

01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:06.480
that there could be something interesting

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:08.460
over at the Monte Project this week.

01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:10.580
Ubuntu Mate, I should say, not the Mate Project,

01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:12.220
but Ubuntu Mate.

01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:13.700
Actually, the opposite.

01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:14.540
Oh, really?

01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:15.620
Oh, I got it right the first time.

01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:16.460
Oh, good for me.

01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:17.280
Yeah, you did.

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:18.120
Hey, look at that, accident.

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:19.900
And then I messed it up by correcting myself.

01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:21.580
That's a life lesson.

01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:23.620
I can also throw some news in about Ubuntu Mate

01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:24.460
if you like as well.

01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:25.940
Well, then that would be just right all along,

01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:27.140
so that would be great.

01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:28.260
So let's start.

01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:30.140
Let's start with Mate.

01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:35.140
Okay, so Mate 1.18 was released about one year ago,

01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:38.420
and that's been a long-lived version.

01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:39.740
We've been supporting that,

01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:41.740
and we've had three point releases,

01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:45.500
so it's very robust and stable now.

01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:49.940
But we have just closed the feature branches

01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:51.180
on the Mate desktop,

01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:56.180
and we'll be releasing Mate 1.20 in the next week or so,

01:05:56.180 --> 01:05:59.740
so expect that to hit your distributions soon.

01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:01.220
That is really exciting.

01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:05.140
So, okay, so it's 1.20, right?

01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:07.780
1.20, yeah, I wanted this one to be a 2.0,

01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:10.260
but I've gone with consensus of the team.

01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:12.060
We're going with 1.20.

01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:13.500
I thought the next one would have been 1.19, though,

01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:15.140
so you did skip one rev.

01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:17.460
1.19 was the development snapshots.

01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:18.300
I see, okay.

01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:19.820
I see.

01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:21.660
Wow, so what's the headlining features?

01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:24.860
Are there headlining features?

01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:29.100
Well, there's some boring things that are important

01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:32.580
in that there's thousands of bug fixes,

01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:35.980
and a lot of those we've been cherry picking back

01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:39.380
into the 1.18 stuff for the important things,

01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:43.340
which is why people have seen that Ubuntu,

01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:46.340
Mate 17.10, and 18.04 daily

01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:49.060
are really very robust at the moment.

01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:50.500
But there's been a lot of work

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:52.660
in the Window Manager, for example,

01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:55.820
so that's now got hardware acceleration.

01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:57.780
Oh, I love that.

01:06:57.780 --> 01:07:02.780
Yeah, and is, what's the word, screen tear-free,

01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:09.180
and now supports quadrant and upper and lower panel tiling

01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:12.660
within the standard Window Manager,

01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:14.860
and a whole heap of key bindings as well.

01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:15.700
That sounds huge.

01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:17.020
That actually sounds pretty big.

01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:19.660
Yeah, that's quite a bit of work,

01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:23.060
and this really came about because we were looking

01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:25.340
at where we needed to go with things,

01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:29.380
as a team, we don't see that right now is the time

01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:33.820
for us to invest in any serious Wayland development,

01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:35.460
and there were things that we could do

01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:38.900
to improve our desktop on top of X11,

01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:41.460
so we've taken steps to do that.

01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:44.260
And this is work that won't arrive in time,

01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:45.780
but we've also started the work

01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:49.380
to really finesse the high DPI support.

01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:53.340
So high DPI support is much improved,

01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:56.340
it's still got the experimental tag in that

01:07:56.340 --> 01:08:01.060
it is not a seamless, it just automagically enables,

01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:04.340
but if you twiddle the right knobs,

01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:07.820
you actually get a fairly decent high DPI experience

01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:10.860
with Marte now, and a blog is forthcoming.

01:08:10.860 --> 01:08:13.140
I've actually got it drafted, had it drafted for weeks,

01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:16.860
I need to get on and post that, how to turn that stuff on.

01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:21.340
Oh boy, oh boy, I mean, just, that's a,

01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:23.260
I could see why you wanted to do a 2.0,

01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:24.260
especially with the Harburg seller.

01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:26.100
Is it Marco, is that the?

01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:29.300
Yeah, Marco is the window manager, yeah.

01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:30.740
All right, that's pretty great.

01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:31.980
Is there anything else in that arena,

01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:34.820
or do you wanna slip in a little secret about Ubuntu Marte?

01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:37.780
Well, in order, exploiting the features

01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:40.580
that we've used there, and some of the changes

01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:41.780
we've made in Marte itself,

01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:45.420
there's one sad thing about Marte 1.20.

01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:48.580
As a rule, we don't like to remove features,

01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:51.260
but we've actually had to remove some of the features

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:53.140
we had to remove a feature.

01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:55.100
So if you've used the desktop,

01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:59.260
one of the panel applets is a stock ticker,

01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:00.980
and we've had to drop that,

01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:05.980
because Yahoo have ended their API

01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:08.820
that we were hooked up to in order to get that data.

01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:11.380
Like many other services around the internet,

01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:13.420
we're all using this Yahoo API.

01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:15.820
That's gone away, it's not coming back,

01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:18.060
and there is no drop-in replacement.

01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:20.980
So unfortunately, we've had to drop that applet,

01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:22.700
because it's defunct.

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:23.540
I'm sure many-

01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:24.380
You should replace it

01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:26.700
with a crypto coin monitor instead.

01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:27.620
Absolutely.

01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:28.820
But they already exist,

01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:31.100
we don't need to carry that in the core project.

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:34.500
I'm sure many serious stock traders were using that.

01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:36.100
Yeah, yeah.

01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:39.900
So building on top of the features that exist in Marte,

01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:43.500
in fact, as we've been talking,

01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:45.900
I've been working on the global menu.

01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:50.180
So the global menu implementation in Ubuntu Marte 18.04

01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:53.820
will be such that that is permanently available,

01:09:53.820 --> 01:09:55.060
not necessarily enabled,

01:09:55.060 --> 01:10:00.060
but permanently available in all of the various layouts.

01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:02.980
And what that means specifically

01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:06.100
is that the HUD will now work in any of the layouts

01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:08.940
in Ubuntu Marte rather than just the few

01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:10.700
that had the global menu enabled.

01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:13.980
So that's an improvement I'm hopefully gonna land

01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:16.260
this evening after we've finished chatting.

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:19.220
And then the other thing we're looking at doing

01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:23.860
in Ubuntu Marte is we're working on our next generation

01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:27.420
of the Ubuntu Marte welcome and the software boutique.

01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:33.740
And at the Debian conference last year,

01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:39.780
the Debian Marte team were asked to more closely align

01:10:41.580 --> 01:10:46.580
with Ubuntu Marte in terms of default settings and setup

01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:51.580
and things like welcome and the software boutique.

01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:55.500
So we're going to be delivering Ubuntu Marte welcome

01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:58.660
and the software boutique as snaps

01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:02.380
so that Debian can take advantage of that.

01:11:02.380 --> 01:11:04.100
And a little bit longer term,

01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:07.820
we'll be adding some support so it can be white labeled.

01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:10.220
So when it's running on Debian,

01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:14.860
it can present a different look and feel and content.

01:11:14.860 --> 01:11:18.140
That is fantastic.

01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:22.420
And it's fascinating to me that snap applications

01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:25.260
can be contained in a snap,

01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:26.960
but still have the ability to manipulate

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:29.020
the package management on the host system.

01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:29.860
So it's like-

01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:33.060
Well, these snaps would very specifically be classic.

01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:36.340
So these would be snaps that are effectively

01:11:36.340 --> 01:11:38.740
like a deb installed on your host system

01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:42.180
that effectively uncontained because they need to do

01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:43.460
exactly as you've just described,

01:11:43.460 --> 01:11:45.740
they need to add and remove software

01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:48.140
and welcome does other things,

01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:50.580
to configure peripherals and what have you.

01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:54.140
So yeah, very much unconfined applications,

01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:57.140
but by delivering them as snaps.

01:11:57.140 --> 01:11:59.800
Welcome and boutique are our USP.

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:03.760
It's what broadly defines Ubuntu Marte's identity.

01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:07.660
We haven't been moving very quickly recently,

01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:10.300
but that's the development's ramping up now.

01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:11.940
And what I want to be able to do

01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:15.180
is continually deliver improvements

01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:19.900
to the Ubuntu Marte users through welcome and the boutique

01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:23.780
without having to use PPAs that people don't know about

01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:27.140
and all sorts of other complicated systems,

01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:27.980
but having a snap,

01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:30.160
we can just keep delivering new

01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:31.980
and improved versions rapidly.

01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:33.040
That sounds great.

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:34.220
That sounds really great.

01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:36.860
I am obviously a big fan of sort of eliminating

01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:39.260
some of those PPAs as much as possible

01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:42.580
and probably more and more as time goes on.

01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:44.460
When does, so I'm clear,

01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:46.020
when does that kind of,

01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:48.340
is that the 1804 release of Ubuntu Marte?

01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:49.380
That's where some of that will land?

01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:50.220
Yeah.

01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:51.380
Ah, okay.

01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:52.300
Wow.

01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:56.020
How big of a risk is it to switch over to,

01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:57.940
that's a pretty big fundamental switch for the LTS.

01:12:57.940 --> 01:13:01.500
I guess you have time to iterate on it if needed,

01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:04.300
but that seems like a pretty big switch for the LTS.

01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:07.580
Ubuntu Marte shipped a snap in 1710.

01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:08.420
Oh, that's right.

01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:12.340
We have some experience in what's involved in doing that.

01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:16.260
And our friends in the Ubuntu desktop team

01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:19.580
and the foundations team have been improving

01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:23.700
the hooks that exist in the build infrastructure

01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:28.700
so that it's easier to ship snaps on the image.

01:13:28.820 --> 01:13:33.820
So at the moment they are simply installed on the image

01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:36.900
and you only get them if you install an ISO

01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:39.020
that had that snap on it.

01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:41.300
Whereas the changes they're making are,

01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:45.580
if you installed say a beta and in the final release,

01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:47.380
an additional snap was added,

01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:49.020
it seeded like other packages.

01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:51.580
So you get that package added to your system

01:13:51.580 --> 01:13:53.660
as part of the upgrade.

01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:56.100
As I recall, it was a pulse audio mixer, right?

01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:57.500
A command line pulse audio mixer?

01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:58.340
Yeah.

01:13:58.340 --> 01:13:59.860
Yeah, it's pulse mixer.

01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:01.380
Has that gotten much testing or,

01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:03.860
and I know one of the other things I was gonna be curious is,

01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:05.740
has it been updated?

01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:07.580
It has been updated, yes.

01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:11.420
In fact, we did it a couple of few weeks ago, yeah.

01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:13.060
So yes, it's been tested by thousands

01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:14.420
and thousands of people.

01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:15.500
Great.

01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:18.580
So that, and so, and now it's been tested

01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:21.860
to have a snap desktop application shipped on the distro

01:14:21.860 --> 01:14:24.420
that gets updated after the distros release

01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:26.020
with active users.

01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:26.860
Yeah.

01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:28.660
That's a pretty good milestone.

01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:33.220
Yeah, so JJ, you had a question about the beta, go ahead.

01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:35.900
Yeah, so is there any way for me

01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:38.340
to test out any of the new features

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:41.860
of the new version of Mate possibly?

01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:45.420
I'm sort of interested since I am a user of a bunch of Mate.

01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:48.460
So you can test any of the daily images

01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:50.140
for any of the flavors.

01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:54.580
The URL is cdimage.abuntu.com

01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:56.420
and in there you'll find directories

01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:58.100
for each of the flavors.

01:14:58.100 --> 01:15:01.940
And inside there, you'll find the release name.

01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:04.940
So it's bionic at the moment.

01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:07.260
And in there you'll find a directory daily live

01:15:07.260 --> 01:15:09.660
and whatever architectures the flavors support

01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:12.140
you'll find ISO images for in there.

01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:14.900
And you can download those and install them

01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:19.100
on spare laptops or VMs or what have you to test them.

01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:24.100
And then there are also scheduled alpha and beta releases.

01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:25.500
So when those come around,

01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:30.140
there's a more organized test schedule for a week

01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:32.580
around those where each of the flavor teams

01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:35.820
are looking for feedback and looking for the bugs

01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:39.820
that get reported in order to fix and improve.

01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:41.300
So it's like all or nothing.

01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:43.900
What do you mean?

01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:44.740
Sorry?

01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:46.020
So it's like all or nothing, the image,

01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:47.460
like you can't really upgrade

01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:52.020
the actual individual Mate environment possibly or?

01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:53.620
Oh, you're asking like a current install

01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:55.980
and go to a new version of Mate?

01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:56.820
Yes, you can.

01:15:56.820 --> 01:15:59.820
You could run through the same process

01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:02.060
to do a distribution upgrade.

01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:05.620
And you could upgrade from 1710 to 1804.

01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:07.660
To be honest with you,

01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:11.380
none of the flavors did an alpha one

01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:13.580
that was scheduled to happen January the 4th

01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:16.340
for obvious reasons that didn't happen.

01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:18.260
The next alpha will be alpha two,

01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:20.940
which will be the beginning of February.

01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:22.820
I think you'd be best to wait

01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:24.180
until the alphas are out of the way

01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:26.980
cause there's a lot of things moving at the moment.

01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:30.180
If you need your machine to be reliable,

01:16:30.180 --> 01:16:32.780
just avoid 1804 for the moment.

01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:34.140
Now you're telling me I started the upgrade

01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:35.260
before we started.

01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:36.620
Oh, yeah.

01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:37.460
You're fine.

01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:38.380
You've got.

01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:39.460
I've got a hotline to you.

01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:40.540
Yeah, exactly.

01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:43.300
Understood.

01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:45.980
Yeah, that's a lot of great stuff Wimpy.

01:16:45.980 --> 01:16:46.940
Thank you for the update.

01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:49.580
That's pretty, can I want to pick your brain actually?

01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:53.180
I've got an email come into the show from Robert

01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:55.780
and he says, in regards to our Linspire discussion

01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:59.540
last week, he says he loaded up Linspire

01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:02.820
and then loaded up Zubuntu

01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:06.100
and looked at gnome software in both of the latest Zubuntu

01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:09.020
and he saw a different highlighted selection

01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:11.180
of applications in Linspire than he did

01:17:11.180 --> 01:17:14.100
in the machine he was looking at the same time in Zubuntu.

01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:18.300
And so he wondered, does that mean is Linspire injecting

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:20.420
like their own suggestions into that list

01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:23.700
or is it more of like a random rotation

01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:25.220
with the way gnome software displays

01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:28.460
like those featured ones that you guys are curating?

01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:32.100
Yeah, there's a list of say 16

01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:35.820
and like six are picked from that to be displayed.

01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:38.900
Ah, so does gnome software just do like a random selection?

01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:42.460
Yeah, and it rotates I think every 24 hours

01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:44.420
so it's not particularly rapid

01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:46.300
in the way that it represents them.

01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:48.260
Ah, it's confusing.

01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:51.540
That is actually, I kind of, yeah, okay.

01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:55.540
And so any Ubuntu flavor or derivative

01:17:55.540 --> 01:17:56.940
that is shipping gnome software

01:17:56.940 --> 01:18:00.260
is likely just using that same list

01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:02.500
because it's coming from the upstream

01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:04.300
to gnome software that they're repackaging.

01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:05.900
So which Linspire would be doing.

01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:08.180
And so if they were injecting their own list,

01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:10.980
would they have to be modifying gnome software?

01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:13.940
Would it be a fork or is there just some sources file

01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:15.340
that they could go?

01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:17.160
If they were modifying that,

01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:18.500
they would have to have forked it

01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:19.340
and made their own version.

01:18:19.340 --> 01:18:22.300
So that's hard coded in, interesting.

01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:27.300
Well, the source of the data is in one of the plugins, yeah.

01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:28.820
Interesting.

01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:29.660
Learning.

01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:32.660
They could certainly choose to ship their own plugin

01:18:32.660 --> 01:18:34.820
which points to their own data sources

01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:37.100
and they could promote their own applications

01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:40.340
that they prefer for their target users, that's for sure.

01:18:40.340 --> 01:18:43.060
Or remove the plugins they ship by default on Ubuntu,

01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:44.260
that's another option.

01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:48.380
So they can certainly affect the list, that's for sure.

01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:51.500
But it's not likely because it takes then a list

01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:52.340
you have to maintain, right?

01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:54.780
And is that an XML file up somewhere or RSS feed?

01:18:54.780 --> 01:18:55.860
What is that?

01:18:55.860 --> 01:18:57.180
It's a REST API.

01:18:57.180 --> 01:18:58.020
Aha.

01:18:58.020 --> 01:19:00.100
I'm learning over the last week that gnome software

01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:02.340
is deceptively complicated.

01:19:02.340 --> 01:19:03.980
It looks very simple on the front end

01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:06.220
but some of this stuff is more complicated

01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:07.940
than I thought it was.

01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:10.420
I envision this stuff as sources lists

01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:12.780
and a simple text file that somebody could just

01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:14.060
throw an RSS feed in.

01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:16.300
I mean, no, no, of course not.

01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:17.940
Of course, in this day and age,

01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:19.500
you gotta support flat packs and snaps

01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:22.100
and firmware updates and all kinds of things

01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:23.860
and software channels and plugins.

01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:26.700
It's all above my pay grade apparently.

01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:28.300
I'm just glad it works when it does.

01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:30.220
So I wanted to take a moment on the show

01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:32.780
and talk about Ambient Plex again.

01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:34.620
Oh God, I know, I've talked about it too much.

01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:37.980
But I gotta be honest, we actually haven't covered it

01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:40.460
since 2016 on the show and things have really changed.

01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:42.620
In fact, not always for the better either,

01:19:42.620 --> 01:19:43.460
I'll get to that.

01:19:44.700 --> 01:19:45.540
Maybe I should start with that

01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:47.100
so I'm not ending on a super pissed off note.

01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:50.900
But Chris is a little upset about something.

01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:52.060
So let's see, when was the last time

01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:53.540
we covered this here topic here?

01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:55.500
Yeah, let's see, it was Linux Unplugged,

01:19:56.420 --> 01:19:57.860
I think it was like 156.

01:19:57.860 --> 01:20:01.300
So if you dig around in that range,

01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:03.380
you will get a more comprehensive coverage

01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:04.340
of what we're about to talk about,

01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:07.340
including things like Tiny Media Manager

01:20:07.340 --> 01:20:11.440
and integrating more with Kodi and whatnot.

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:12.980
But just really briefly off the top,

01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:16.220
I've been head to head comparing MB and Plex,

01:20:16.220 --> 01:20:18.940
which are two different streaming options

01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:22.940
that allow you to collect a massive media

01:20:22.940 --> 01:20:24.660
on a file server or on a desktop.

01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:27.180
I actually have been running these for testing,

01:20:27.180 --> 01:20:29.840
one just on a workstation and one on a server,

01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:31.100
a couple different servers actually.

01:20:31.100 --> 01:20:33.780
Anyways, it is a server side software

01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:34.740
that has a client side piece

01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:36.420
and the client side can run on a Roku,

01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:39.940
an Android TV, an Apple TV, a web browser, a mobile device,

01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:43.140
and it allows you to throw a bunch of media up on a server,

01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:45.460
it scans all of it, figures out the metadata,

01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:47.220
downloads the information from the internet

01:20:47.220 --> 01:20:49.420
and artwork and descriptions

01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:50.840
and organizes all the seasons

01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:52.700
for your TV shows and your movies.

01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:53.900
It's quite handy and it makes you feel

01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:55.880
like you're living in the future, it's great.

01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:59.380
And there's two main competitors in this field these days,

01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:00.860
there's MB and Plex.

01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:02.340
And Kodi does fit in here, like I said,

01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:04.580
check our past episode for more.

01:21:04.580 --> 01:21:07.780
But just really briefly, if you're running Kodi today

01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:10.460
and you're wondering why the hell would you want MB or Plex,

01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:14.000
just a quick versus like Kodi,

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.700
Plex and MB are not nearly as fast as Kodi.

01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:18.940
If you're pointing Kodi at some local files on a disk,

01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:21.820
Kodi is going to whoop its butt in load times

01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:23.800
and fast forward every single time.

01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:28.280
And these both require fairly reliable networking,

01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:30.180
a reliable LAN or Wi-Fi

01:21:30.180 --> 01:21:32.140
and a pretty solid internet connection

01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:32.980
if you're doing streaming.

01:21:32.980 --> 01:21:35.120
So those are their main detractions from Kodi.

01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:37.920
But they're also better than Kodi at certain things,

01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:41.820
like on my testing, they are better at media detection,

01:21:41.820 --> 01:21:43.620
getting the right metadata information

01:21:43.620 --> 01:21:46.700
about esoteric shows that are named something kind of off,

01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:48.980
identifying a series that maybe isn't quite right,

01:21:48.980 --> 01:21:50.380
it's much better at that.

01:21:50.380 --> 01:21:52.660
And obviously, as I started with,

01:21:52.660 --> 01:21:55.100
it's very easy to use for streaming

01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:56.740
for your friends and family.

01:21:56.740 --> 01:21:59.820
In fact, Plex has a feature called Plex sharing,

01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:02.740
which allows you to share with friends and family,

01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:04.120
you just add them as a buddy.

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:06.300
And so let's take my buddy Chase from Unfilter,

01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:08.820
he and I are friends on Plex

01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:10.900
and we share each other's libraries.

01:22:10.900 --> 01:22:13.580
He happens to have episodes of Voyager that I don't have.

01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:16.220
So if I'm in a mood to go watch Catherine Janeway

01:22:16.220 --> 01:22:18.980
make out with some Irish guy in Fairhaven on the holodeck,

01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:20.860
I will just switch over to his Plex server

01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:24.060
and I will stream Voyager from his server for a bit.

01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:26.380
And MB has something similar to this.

01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:29.540
And so what I wanted to know for purposes of this show,

01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:32.300
which one might be better for the audience

01:22:32.300 --> 01:22:34.980
and which one's more open source,

01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:37.320
as if this is some sort of measuring stick,

01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:39.060
but which one's more open source.

01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:41.500
And so I looked at both the Plex project

01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:43.620
and I looked at the MB project.

01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:45.440
And this full credit goes to a discussion

01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:47.540
that really got kicked off in our Telegram group

01:22:47.540 --> 01:22:49.760
where people were asking questions about this

01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:51.220
and getting clarifications,

01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:53.300
trying to figure out what parts of Plex are open source,

01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:54.940
which parts are closed source.

01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:58.900
I'll say this, for Plex, I was pretty surprised.

01:22:58.900 --> 01:23:00.540
I was pretty surprised.

01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:01.460
It's amazing actually.

01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:03.700
They have a whole page that goes over all their licensing,

01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:07.060
but they have everything

01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:10.300
except for the backend server part up on their GitHub page.

01:23:10.300 --> 01:23:11.940
And it's all kinds of crazy.

01:23:11.940 --> 01:23:14.020
You realize what a project this must be

01:23:14.020 --> 01:23:16.460
when you just go through their GitHub page

01:23:16.460 --> 01:23:18.620
and look at all of the fricking projects

01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:21.620
that they're contributing to or have forked for Plex.

01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:22.780
And one of the ones that's on here

01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:23.740
that I was really happy to see,

01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:25.660
and I didn't know this before I really did the digging,

01:23:25.660 --> 01:23:26.940
even though I use this,

01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:28.740
guess I'm not that observant.

01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:33.740
The Plex for Kodi add-on is developed by the Plex project.

01:23:34.100 --> 01:23:36.460
Plex folks are actually creating that add-on for Kodi.

01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:38.540
So if you prefer to use Kodi for playback,

01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:41.380
but want it to connect to your Plex database,

01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:42.820
Kodi's actually writing that plugin,

01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:44.740
or I mean the Plex people are actually writing that plugin.

01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:47.340
So it's about as official as it gets.

01:23:47.340 --> 01:23:48.820
But how did it compare to MB?

01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:52.220
Which essentially has a similar feature set to Plex.

01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:54.700
Couple of differences in how they're implemented for sure.

01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:57.940
Plex is simpler, maybe slightly more user-friendly,

01:23:57.940 --> 01:23:59.380
but MB is more flexible.

01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:01.280
It's completely open source.

01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:06.460
And it feels more like a self-contained application.

01:24:06.460 --> 01:24:08.020
That's not often the weeds connected

01:24:08.020 --> 01:24:09.820
to like online news streaming.

01:24:09.820 --> 01:24:12.940
And it just feels like something that just is simple.

01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:15.220
I actually prefer it for my LAN streaming.

01:24:15.220 --> 01:24:17.740
And I use Plex for my internet streaming.

01:24:18.660 --> 01:24:22.380
Everything, everything regarding MB is open source.

01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:24.740
The front end, the back end.

01:24:24.740 --> 01:24:29.740
I believe, I believe perhaps the Android apps might not be,

01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:32.620
but the server, the web client,

01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:35.380
some of the secret sauce it uses to stream all of that

01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:37.500
is open source.

01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:40.860
And both of these projects have a revenue model.

01:24:40.860 --> 01:24:45.240
Plex sells the Plex Pass and MB sells MB Premium.

01:24:46.380 --> 01:24:48.100
In MB's case, it's a little more of a,

01:24:48.100 --> 01:24:50.460
hey, thanks for being awesome.

01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:52.540
Here's five bucks.

01:24:52.540 --> 01:24:53.600
You get a couple other things,

01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:56.420
like some nice file syncing features with MB

01:24:56.420 --> 01:24:58.540
if you become a premium member.

01:24:58.540 --> 01:25:01.380
Plex Pass, Plex Pass has been getting more

01:25:01.380 --> 01:25:02.620
and more appealing.

01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:06.100
You can buy a monthly or a one-time.

01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:07.940
And you get nicer features.

01:25:07.940 --> 01:25:10.620
You can be in the beta channel.

01:25:10.620 --> 01:25:12.900
You can use their Plex Cloud streaming service.

01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:15.060
It's nice, it's kind of worth it.

01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:18.700
I bought a, they had a sale two years ago or something,

01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:21.600
and I bought a lifetime subscription, just done, done.

01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:24.540
And these are obviously vital avenues

01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:26.180
for these two different projects,

01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:29.560
whichever one you might like or not like to stay afloat.

01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:32.420
But one of them is being attacked

01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:35.220
by the very open source community it serves.

01:25:35.220 --> 01:25:37.980
MB is being eaten from within

01:25:37.980 --> 01:25:40.180
its own open source community.

01:25:40.180 --> 01:25:43.040
And I feel like this is a warning sign

01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:45.560
that is going to stop other projects

01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:48.660
from ever doing a fully open source project.

01:25:48.660 --> 01:25:51.580
It's gonna lock in this model, potentially,

01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:55.100
of a closed source proprietary server component

01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:58.000
and only open sourcing bits and pieces here.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.560
And if nothing else, least of which,

01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:03.180
the least of which is gonna happen,

01:26:03.180 --> 01:26:06.180
is the Plex group will be able to look at this incident

01:26:06.180 --> 01:26:07.880
and point at this incident and say,

01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:10.860
this is why we will never 100% open source everything.

01:26:10.860 --> 01:26:12.180
We will never do it.

01:26:12.180 --> 01:26:13.500
We never have to.

01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:14.320
This is why.

01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:16.820
This is now the ultimate justification.

01:26:19.620 --> 01:26:20.940
You gotta look at this and you gotta wonder

01:26:20.940 --> 01:26:22.860
if maybe this isn't a fundamental flaw of open source.

01:26:22.860 --> 01:26:27.380
So one user of MB got really pissed off,

01:26:27.380 --> 01:26:28.740
kind of for legitimate reasons,

01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:30.340
but where he goes with it,

01:26:30.340 --> 01:26:33.300
fundamentally is going to undermine MB's revenue source.

01:26:33.300 --> 01:26:35.980
And I don't recommend anybody install this

01:26:35.980 --> 01:26:37.620
because these projects need to be funded

01:26:37.620 --> 01:26:38.620
or else they're gonna go away.

01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:42.220
And somebody created an MB unlocked project,

01:26:42.220 --> 01:26:45.560
which just gives you all of the premium features for free.

01:26:46.820 --> 01:26:47.780
Because why not?

01:26:47.780 --> 01:26:49.120
It's just open source, right?

01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:52.980
So at some point, the MB developers added a nag screen

01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:54.460
before playback that reminded you

01:26:54.460 --> 01:26:57.820
that you could get MB premium.

01:26:57.820 --> 01:26:59.540
I've never seen that because pretty quickly,

01:26:59.540 --> 01:27:02.220
like my first couple of days into MB testing

01:27:02.220 --> 01:27:04.460
a long time ago, I bought MB premium

01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:06.060
because I thought this is a good project.

01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:07.820
It offers good competition to Plex.

01:27:07.820 --> 01:27:08.780
I like seeing that.

01:27:08.780 --> 01:27:09.660
I wanna keep them going.

01:27:09.660 --> 01:27:10.500
So I paid for it.

01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:11.500
I've never seen this nag screen.

01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:14.740
And I admit if I saw a nag screen, I wouldn't like that.

01:27:14.740 --> 01:27:16.580
And the community did ask them to stop

01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:18.580
and they basically said no.

01:27:18.580 --> 01:27:20.840
And this guy, this is a quote, says this is bullshit.

01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:23.660
For the GPL2, it's a GPL2 licensed product.

01:27:23.660 --> 01:27:25.340
This is bullshit that they're doing this.

01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:29.000
And his justification is because it's a GPL2 project,

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:30.540
how dare they?

01:27:30.540 --> 01:27:34.900
And so I decided that I would just go remove the nag screen.

01:27:34.900 --> 01:27:37.060
But in the process of removing the nag screen,

01:27:37.060 --> 01:27:40.220
I discovered that unlocking all of the premium features

01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:42.420
was just the simplest way.

01:27:42.420 --> 01:27:43.680
So here you go.

01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:45.060
And there's a AUR.

01:27:45.060 --> 01:27:46.900
Of course, you can just get a Docker image

01:27:46.900 --> 01:27:49.940
of an entire MB server that's been pre-activated

01:27:49.940 --> 01:27:53.020
for premium, ready to go, just a Docker install away,

01:27:54.100 --> 01:27:55.220
which is actually a pretty common way

01:27:55.220 --> 01:27:56.540
for people to try out these projects.

01:27:56.540 --> 01:27:57.780
So that actually really sucks

01:27:57.780 --> 01:27:59.180
because that gets same billing

01:27:59.180 --> 01:28:01.580
as the actual MB project in Docker Hub.

01:28:02.780 --> 01:28:04.220
And if more people start downloading this,

01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:06.380
it'll actually show up higher in the ranks.

01:28:07.540 --> 01:28:08.820
And what would prevent any other,

01:28:08.820 --> 01:28:11.100
what prevents anybody doing this to any other project

01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:12.180
that's completely open source

01:28:12.180 --> 01:28:14.300
that has some sort of revenue system

01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:16.340
where you can unlock additional features?

01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:20.620
It feels like this fundamentally validates the fear

01:28:20.620 --> 01:28:22.660
of a lot of developers who've been looking at coming over

01:28:22.660 --> 01:28:24.540
to Linux and can't quite figure out

01:28:24.540 --> 01:28:26.100
how they get the licensing right.

01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:28.340
Well, we just validated their fears with this.

01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:31.380
I don't know, maybe I'm, just to me,

01:28:31.380 --> 01:28:33.880
this is just so, so upsetting to see this

01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:37.420
because if we make it impossible for people

01:28:37.420 --> 01:28:38.520
to make money at open source,

01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:40.520
all we're gonna have left is commercial stuff

01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:44.100
and Electron apps and proprietary backends,

01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:46.500
and this problem is never gonna get any better.

01:28:49.140 --> 01:28:50.860
It's pretty disappointing.

01:28:50.860 --> 01:28:54.820
So don't install it, don't use it.

01:28:54.820 --> 01:28:57.460
Or if you do, you know, also send them a few bucks.

01:28:57.460 --> 01:29:00.100
I mean, I just, I really, it's one patch.

01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:01.900
You know, this guy just applies one patch

01:29:01.900 --> 01:29:03.620
and it unlocks all of the features.

01:29:03.620 --> 01:29:06.860
And maybe the MB project could like obfuscate their code.

01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:08.100
I don't know.

01:29:08.100 --> 01:29:09.500
Mumble, remove, what do you think?

01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:14.500
Is this something that is addressable?

01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:17.100
This is not the first time this has happened.

01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:19.540
Other projects have suffered with this in the past.

01:29:19.540 --> 01:29:23.300
I mean, I remember this happening in the subsonic community

01:29:23.300 --> 01:29:26.100
for much the same reasons.

01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:29.860
And there was another one as well recently.

01:29:29.860 --> 01:29:31.020
It may have been MB.

01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:34.060
I think Mark talked about this on the Ubuntu podcast,

01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:35.700
the whole nag screen thing.

01:29:37.220 --> 01:29:39.220
Yeah, your subsonic's a great example of that.

01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:40.940
That's a great example.

01:29:40.940 --> 01:29:44.820
Yeah, it feels bad.

01:29:44.820 --> 01:29:45.700
It feels really bad.

01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:49.540
It feels like it just takes one pissed off open source user

01:29:49.540 --> 01:29:50.860
that knows how to fix this thing

01:29:50.860 --> 01:29:53.120
and then you've just undermined an entire business

01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:54.860
that has multiple employees.

01:29:54.860 --> 01:29:56.180
Many employees.

01:29:56.180 --> 01:29:57.020
Go ahead, sorry.

01:29:59.380 --> 01:30:01.780
Yeah, so it sort of reminds me a little bit

01:30:01.780 --> 01:30:03.620
about the email clients as well

01:30:03.620 --> 01:30:08.620
having this sort of similar sort of conflict, I guess,

01:30:08.780 --> 01:30:13.420
with regards to supporting certain email protocols

01:30:13.420 --> 01:30:15.340
such as Exchange and all that.

01:30:15.340 --> 01:30:16.780
That makes any sense?

01:30:16.780 --> 01:30:18.660
Yeah, I do follow what you mean there,

01:30:18.660 --> 01:30:20.980
where the sort of like premium features and whatnot

01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:22.640
and additional add-ons that they sometimes

01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:25.220
have to pay licenses for and whatnot.

01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:27.980
You know, just to wrap up, so head to head here,

01:30:27.980 --> 01:30:31.860
my takeaway is if streaming to smart devices

01:30:31.860 --> 01:30:33.660
and streaming between friends

01:30:33.660 --> 01:30:34.980
or streaming to family members

01:30:34.980 --> 01:30:37.540
that maybe kind of just have like a typical network setup,

01:30:37.540 --> 01:30:40.060
they're not really doing port forwarding,

01:30:40.060 --> 01:30:42.620
Plex is the way, if you need those things,

01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:43.440
Plex is the way to go.

01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:44.900
If you don't need those things,

01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:47.780
I would really give a hearty endorsement these days for MB.

01:30:47.780 --> 01:30:50.080
It's got a couple of things I'm not a huge fan of

01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:51.860
over remote connections.

01:30:51.860 --> 01:30:53.580
I've even had problems where I've punched a hole

01:30:53.580 --> 01:30:55.100
through my firewall, we got port forwarding

01:30:55.100 --> 01:30:57.740
going to the right box, and yet for some reason

01:30:57.740 --> 01:30:59.540
my remote MB system still can't connect.

01:30:59.540 --> 01:31:01.840
Whereas with Plex, it'll do a relay if it has to

01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:02.920
to make that work.

01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:06.020
But if I'm using the two different products on my LAN,

01:31:06.020 --> 01:31:09.020
I find MB to be faster on the same exact hardware

01:31:09.020 --> 01:31:11.220
doing head to head, same hardware, same server,

01:31:11.220 --> 01:31:13.020
I find MB to be faster.

01:31:13.020 --> 01:31:16.140
I prefer the way it displays some information.

01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:19.340
Plex has been abstracting away your individual episodes

01:31:19.340 --> 01:31:21.340
more and more and trying to boost things

01:31:21.340 --> 01:31:23.660
into new arrivals and trending

01:31:23.660 --> 01:31:25.140
and all these different things that make it feel

01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:26.660
like YouTube that I just hate.

01:31:26.660 --> 01:31:30.180
Whereas MB feels more like here's your stuff,

01:31:30.180 --> 01:31:32.220
here's your season, just go.

01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:35.420
And then the creme de la creme mode for me,

01:31:35.420 --> 01:31:37.860
the perfect setup here has been now,

01:31:37.860 --> 01:31:41.060
and this is since 2016, so it's really kind of bared out,

01:31:41.060 --> 01:31:44.960
is if I can, Android TV running Kodi

01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:46.580
with the MB or Plex plugin,

01:31:46.580 --> 01:31:49.500
depending on which particular media pool I'm pulling from,

01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:52.640
connected to wired storage.

01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:55.160
So in my case, it's a QNAP

01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:57.320
that has hardware accelerated decoding.

01:31:57.320 --> 01:31:59.160
I've reviewed the QNAP in the past.

01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:01.240
You can install codecs from its app store,

01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:03.000
you get hardware accelerated decoding.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:06.320
I can be streaming to multiple boxes, no problem,

01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:08.280
my NAS is still fully responsive.

01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:10.980
There's no big, huge, loud server anywhere.

01:32:10.980 --> 01:32:15.240
It's an Android TV and a QNAP and it's glorious.

01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:18.240
And both MB and Plex can run on it just fine.

01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:20.960
And so it's really great to do head-to-head comparison on.

01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:23.680
And what I walk away with, at the end of the day,

01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:25.480
I'm gonna go with the GPL2 product,

01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:28.120
if everything else is coming up equal

01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:31.480
and I'm watching on the LAN, I'm going with MB.

01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:33.480
And so I have this setup now

01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:36.800
where when I'm just watching something off my hard drive,

01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:38.160
I'm watching something here at the studio,

01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:39.900
we do the same thing here at the studio LAN,

01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:41.040
it's watched over MB.

01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:43.020
And then when we watch something remotely,

01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:44.880
we watch over Plex, and I know that sounds crazy,

01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:47.160
but they just point at the same files anyways.

01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:49.920
It's not like I have two sets of all my movies or TV shows.

01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:51.560
So it works out pretty well.

01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:56.120
I really have, I've come to love this setup in a way

01:32:56.120 --> 01:32:57.720
that I've never quite achieved

01:32:57.720 --> 01:32:58.960
with my media setups in the past.

01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:00.600
And I spent money on all kinds of things.

01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:03.520
I even took a weird dark turn

01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:05.320
down the Windows Media Center lane

01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:07.560
where they had these Media Center front end boxes

01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:09.280
from like Linksys and whatnot

01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:12.200
that were trying to get to that hardware appliance style

01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:14.300
and it wasn't there, just wasn't there.

01:33:14.300 --> 01:33:16.800
It was horrible and also Windows.

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:19.840
And this, this has finally been it.

01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:22.680
Anyways, I have links to all of the MB stuff,

01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:24.160
including the open source projects,

01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:27.060
the Kodi plugins, and that goodness in the show notes.

01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:30.760
Before we get off the topic of MB or Plex,

01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:32.240
Pierre, are you setting up a new Plex server?

01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:33.100
What's your plans there?

01:33:33.100 --> 01:33:33.940
What are you doing?

01:33:33.940 --> 01:33:35.160
Because-

01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:36.440
I need hardware first.

01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:38.200
Why not just run it on, see, that's the thing is,

01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:39.680
why not just run it on your workstation

01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:40.640
if you have it on all the time?

01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:43.280
It's not like you're watching TV while you're gaming.

01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:45.960
First of all, I don't have a TV.

01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:46.960
Well, okay, but you know what I mean.

01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:50.160
It's not like your machine's gonna be decoding video files

01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:51.480
while you're playing a video game and streaming

01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:53.080
because you're gonna be playing video games and streaming.

01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:56.000
So I just, I recently tried it out on workstation

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.400
for different testing of versions

01:33:57.400 --> 01:33:59.360
and I realized it's great having it right there

01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:02.240
on my desktop is great because I can hook up a USB disk

01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:04.880
and I can add that and I can download something immediately

01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:06.380
and have it scan my downloads folder.

01:34:06.380 --> 01:34:08.400
So for like a full week, I'm like,

01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:10.280
I'm just running it off my workstation.

01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:13.760
Well, you say that, but while I'm streaming,

01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:15.760
the girlfriend could be watching videos.

01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:17.560
All right, Popey, Popey says he's caught me

01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:19.680
in a hypocrisy loop.

01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:21.040
What have I done wrong, Popey?

01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:22.080
Set me straight here.

01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:27.760
So the argument is we should not patch out

01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:32.320
and make it easy for people to use content

01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:35.160
as in MB or whatever piece of software

01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:36.400
that somebody else has developed

01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:39.080
and is trying to make some money out of.

01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:41.640
And that's a bad thing,

01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:45.320
but the chances are what people are using MB for

01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:48.080
is downloaded TV programs

01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:51.980
that they probably didn't have the rights to watch.

01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:57.160
So how is that rationalized in your mind?

01:34:57.160 --> 01:34:59.960
Well, in my view, because the product itself,

01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:02.560
MB was still fully functional, right?

01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:03.960
It was just that NAG screen,

01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:06.720
which does sound super annoying,

01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:09.920
but it wasn't as if it couldn't say like playback MKVs

01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:11.840
without the premiere feature.

01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:13.480
It just would say, hey, did you know we have

01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:15.000
a premiere feature and then you click play.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.120
It's so it, when it's-

01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:18.640
No, it wasn't that part.

01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:21.480
It was more the part that, hey, you guys out there,

01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:23.480
you should pay for this thing

01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:25.560
that someone has worked hard for

01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:30.040
in order to watch this thing that you've stolen

01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:33.640
in inverted commas that somebody else has worked hard for,

01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:35.280
TV programs and films, right?

01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:37.720
Yeah, no, I follow what your question was.

01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:39.760
I just, I was just trying to say like,

01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:43.840
if MB had disabled the product and made it like,

01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:47.000
so in my case, take Star Trek Discovery.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.680
I download Star Trek Discovery every single Sunday

01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:51.320
as fast as I possibly can.

01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:55.280
And I watch it via MB or Plex, depending on the setup.

01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:59.120
But I also am a CBS All Access subscriber.

01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:01.320
Same with the House of Cards.

01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:02.360
I'm a Netflix subscriber.

01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:05.080
I don't ever watch it on Netflix because it's ass.

01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:07.440
I just prefer to watch it on my TV.

01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:08.600
And I have a MiFi.

01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:11.320
So you're right, it is up to the individual

01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:12.640
what the morality is.

01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:14.720
And it's, you're right, it's also not surprising

01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:17.040
that people that are comfortable stealing a lot of content

01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:18.600
would be comfortable stealing the product

01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:19.880
to watch the content.

01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:21.720
That does make sense.

01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:25.880
I feel like the, it's self-harm though.

01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:29.940
When you, if you download Game of Thrones,

01:36:29.940 --> 01:36:31.840
you're not putting Game of Thrones out of business.

01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:35.080
But if you fundamentally undermine the way for MB

01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:38.440
to monetize MB, they will go out of business.

01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:40.160
And they will, they'll be gone.

01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:43.000
And then you'll have no way to watch your stolen TV shows.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.560
So it's sort of like pissing in your own well.

01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:46.400
Right.

01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:48.880
But yeah, you do bring up a good point.

01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:51.440
And I wonder what the audience would say about that too.

01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:52.280
Let us know.

01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:54.940
Tweet me at chrisles or leave a comment on the YouTubes

01:36:54.940 --> 01:36:58.160
so we can all read it or linuxunplugged.reddit.com.

01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:02.000
Now we gotta go because the Ask Noah program

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.240
is just around the corner.

01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:06.840
Mr. Noah, what's coming up on the Ask Noah over there?

01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:08.200
Dude, we got so many cool things

01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:09.040
we're gonna be talking about.

01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:11.560
We're talking about high resolution audio.

01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:12.400
Ooh.

01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:13.240
There's somebody out there

01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:14.280
and they're gonna be like, that's snake oil.

01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:15.680
And then there's the other half of your audience

01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:17.960
that's like, no, no, no, that he finally caught on.

01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:19.880
And so you're gonna find out which one it is.

01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:22.040
High resolution audio under Linux.

01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:23.940
Is it possible or is it snake oil?

01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:25.960
Hmm, interesting.

01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:28.760
Now rumor has it that there may be a topic expert

01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:31.080
coming on the show to discuss it with you as well.

01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:33.920
There is, anytime we dive into the topic,

01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:35.480
we go find the person in the industry

01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:36.960
that knows more than anyone else.

01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:38.960
And in that case, when it comes to hi-fi audio,

01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:40.200
I was telling you last night,

01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:42.400
there is nobody else other than Bob Carver.

01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:44.600
I mean, he's just the guy when it comes to hi-fi audio.

01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:47.000
That's sort of a pretty good get.

01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:49.680
Nobody networks like Noah.

01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:50.960
Nobody does.

01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:51.800
I gotta say it.

01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:53.840
It really comes to your advantage sometimes.

01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:55.520
Well done, sir.

01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:57.400
I have friends in high places.

01:37:57.400 --> 01:37:58.240
Yeah, I'm looking forward to that.

01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:00.500
And so now we're doing the Ask Noah program

01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:01.920
and the Unplugged program back to back.

01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:04.200
So you come over to jblab.tv on a Tuesday.

01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:05.600
You can hang out with our virtual hug

01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:06.720
and all these wonderful gentlemen.

01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:08.720
And we'd love to have some wonderful ladies in there.

01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:10.440
Then you stick around and watch some content

01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:11.520
and hear the extra live stuff

01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:13.120
that doesn't make it in the published version.

01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:14.760
And then you keep watching and get Ask Noah.

01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:16.160
It's like a whole week,

01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:18.160
or I mean like a whole afternoon, evening,

01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:19.940
depending on morning in your time zone,

01:38:19.940 --> 01:38:22.560
block of Linux live with your participation.

01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:24.880
Cause we've got the Mumble Room on the Unplugged program.

01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:27.280
And then we've got your live calls on Ask Noah.

01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:28.840
And from time to time rumor has it,

01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:31.520
there'll even be some Mumble participation in Ask Noah,

01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:33.080
which is probably difficult every time you have a guest.

01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:35.080
So every time I say that you got a guest, but.

01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:36.920
Yeah, well actually, so Bob doesn't,

01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:39.040
Bob is not a computer technically savvy.

01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:40.340
So he'll be joining us over phone.

01:38:40.340 --> 01:38:42.160
So we can have Mumble today, yeah.

01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:44.520
But yeah, we call it the Linux sandwich.

01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:46.280
Is that what we call it?

01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:47.680
Oh, good to know.

01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:49.040
Good, good.

01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:51.200
Go get yourself a Patreon account

01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:55.200
and go over to a patreon.com slash Ubuntu underscore mate

01:38:55.200 --> 01:38:57.040
to support some of the fine work

01:38:57.040 --> 01:38:59.540
that Mr. Wimperis is doing with the Ubuntu mate project.

01:38:59.540 --> 01:39:02.960
And a lot of times that stuff funds stuff

01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:04.520
that just goes upstream to mate as well.

01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:07.600
So Ubuntu underscore mate at patreon.com.

01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:09.000
Of course, we're Jupiter Signal.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.920
And they're off, they're off right now.

01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:12.720
They may never return, they say.

01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:14.440
But if you'd like to catch the backlog,

01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:16.240
go check out the Ubuntu podcast.

01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:17.880
There's some great episodes posted over there.

01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:18.980
They're on season break right now.

01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:20.920
Is curry and beer been scheduled, gentlemen?

01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:21.960
Is that?

01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:22.800
Not yet.

01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:24.680
We've had a pre-curry, but we haven't had curry.

01:39:24.680 --> 01:39:25.520
I understand.

01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:26.640
I understand.

01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:27.480
Okay.

01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:28.300
There's a pre-curry.

01:39:28.300 --> 01:39:30.560
You got a, do you have a post-curry too?

01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:32.160
Is there gonna be a post-curry?

01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:34.440
You need to, you know, flex your stomach muscles.

01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:35.280
Yes.

01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:36.240
Before you go for the proper curry.

01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:37.200
So that way, when you're ready

01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:39.400
to have a real serious discussion, you're warmed up.

01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:40.240
You've trained up.

01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:41.080
It's like a marathon.

01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:42.040
I understand.

01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:42.860
All right, guys.

01:39:42.860 --> 01:39:43.700
Well, thanks for being here.

01:39:43.700 --> 01:39:44.960
And thank you, audience, for being here.

01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:47.780
And hopefully Mr. West will be back to health next week.

01:39:47.780 --> 01:39:51.040
In the meantime, go get him at Wes Payne on the Twitter

01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:52.600
and get more of him at the TechSnap program,

01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:54.240
TechSnap.Systems.

01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:56.080
Like I mentioned earlier, I'm at Chris Ellis.

01:39:56.080 --> 01:39:57.440
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:00.320
Our subreddit is linuxunplugged.reddit.com.

01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:03.000
And you can email the show, Jupiterbroadcasting.com

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.160
slash contact.

01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:05.560
Thank you, Robert, for emailing us this week.

01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:07.180
And everybody else, I had more emails queued up,

01:40:07.180 --> 01:40:08.760
but they were for Wes.

01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:11.340
So maybe we'll get those when he comes back next week.

01:40:11.340 --> 01:40:12.680
And again, those live times,

01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:15.160
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:16.480
Thanks so much for being here.

01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:18.240
We'll see you right back here next week

01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:19.160
on the Unplugged program.

01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:20.060
See you next Tuesday.

01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:27.040
I've never installed, you know, slash Linux.

01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:36.040
Get it out of here.

01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:46.640
Get the hell out of here.

01:40:46.640 --> 01:41:02.240
All right, let's see if we can title this thing

01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:04.440
before Noah takes over the airwaves.

01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:07.320
Eabtitles.com, you can still submit.

01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:08.800
You can also submit in the Discord,

01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:10.680
Discord.me slash Jupiter Colony.

01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:12.480
I'll be searching that.

01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:14.520
Let's go pick a title and then we'll get out of here

01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:17.680
and Noah will take us away to AskNoahland.

01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:20.240
Bangsuggest.

01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:21.080
Thank you, gentlemen.

01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:24.080
I am so hooked, JJ, on Indian food.

01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:25.760
I'm actually taking a break right now

01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:27.000
so that way when Noah comes in here,

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:28.160
I'm not burned out because otherwise...

01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:29.000
Attaboy.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.240
Yeah, I'm doing that for you, Brown Bear.

01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:31.480
Oh, that's good, that's good.

01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:32.240
That makes me happy.

01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:33.920
Yep, and I've already warned Angela

01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:36.480
that there will be a business expense

01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:40.800
of butter chicken and stuff.

01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:42.880
Noah refuses to come unless you buy him Indian food.

01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:44.680
That's the reason why I'm sort of trying

01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:46.000
to explain a little bit.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.600
Yeah, I would imagine it's delicious,

01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:51.880
but man, I don't know.

01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:55.120
There's something about that butter chicken.

01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:56.080
You're gonna have to tell me, Noah,

01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:57.520
what you think, but there's something about it

01:41:57.520 --> 01:41:59.520
that's just, mm, it's healing.

01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:01.440
I had it on Friday.

01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:04.000
Me and Wimpy met up with one of our guys

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.760
from the community and spent the day co-working

01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:09.360
in a library in near where Wimpy lives

01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:10.800
and then we went out for curry in the evening

01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:13.360
and it was so good, so good.

01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:14.200
I wish.

01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:16.480
I have a funny story relating to Indian food,

01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:18.000
but you can finish first.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.480
I was just gonna say, Poppy,

01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:21.040
sometime when you're out here,

01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:24.120
it would take a long time because it's like an hour,

01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:26.520
well, it's like 50 minutes, well, an hour,

01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:27.360
depending on traffic.

01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:29.400
Dude, I'm gonna be in Seattle in like a week.

01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:32.040
I know, I know, but do you think you could break away

01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:35.000
for like three hours or so?

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.400
Because we'd have to come all the way up north

01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:39.160
to go to this place, then there's the time to eat

01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:40.720
and then the time to get back.

01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:41.880
That's the problem.

01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:45.000
But it is, I've traveled around some places

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.680
and I've never had Indian food better than,

01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:48.920
at least here in the States that I've traveled to,

01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:50.060
than this place.

01:42:50.060 --> 01:42:51.480
It's just so good.

01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:52.880
I just bought six of them.

01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:56.080
I went in and bought six butter chickens at once last week

01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:58.840
and ate it for four days or something like that.

01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:00.000
It's so good.

01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:05.240
The best curry I've ever had is in Japan.

01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:06.080
Oh yeah, really?

01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:06.920
Okay, okay.

01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:10.000
Yeah, they make some awesome Indian curry in Japan.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.160
I imagine there's something that surpasses it.

01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:13.000
I mean, there must be.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.960
What about Indian curry in Japan?

01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:17.000
Yeah, the best, he said, the best curry in Japan.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.760
The best curry ever is in Japan.

01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:21.160
I don't know if I agree with the best curry ever,

01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:23.500
but they do have some really, really motivated

01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:24.340
Indian people in Japan.

01:43:24.340 --> 01:43:25.440
They make some good food.

01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:26.280
I'm not kidding.

01:43:26.280 --> 01:43:27.120
I mean, they make some.

01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:28.480
What does that mean?

01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:29.840
Motivated Indian people.

01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:31.040
Here's the thing, here's the thing.

01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:31.980
Here's the thing, you have to understand

01:43:31.980 --> 01:43:33.240
something about cuisine, right?

01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:34.080
So think about this.

01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:35.920
In the US, it's easy to make,

01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:38.320
even the worst Indian food passes as amazing here

01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:40.440
because Americans are more or less.

01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:41.520
Boy, does it seem to.

01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:42.880
Bland, yeah, they're just bland.

01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:45.600
I mean, because every American food is just bland.

01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:47.600
But when you go to Japan and you have,

01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:49.920
they're competing on a different culinary level,

01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:51.960
now you have to have a really motivated Indian person

01:43:51.960 --> 01:44:11.960
if you're gonna make it there.
