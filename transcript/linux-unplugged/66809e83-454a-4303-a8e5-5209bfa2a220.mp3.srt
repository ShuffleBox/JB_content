1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
What do you use for flashing ISOs?

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,240
I'm all in on Etcher now.

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,000
Yeah, me too.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,040
I'm just using Etcher right now to burn Fedora 31.

5
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,400
And even old Westpane here is all in on Etcher.

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,240
Yeah, I usually use Etcher, except for the occasional times

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,000
if there's something weird.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We did have an issue with the 1910 ISO, like one time.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,840
It was pop, I think.

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,040
It was the pop ISO.

11
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,560
Pop 1910 ISO.

12
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,120
Etcher was just like, no, no, thanks.

13
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:22,960
I don't know why.

14
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,180
DD Rescue worked fine, though.

15
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,720
Yeah, I kind of feel betrayed that you guys

16
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,760
don't DD everything, man.

17
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,120
Come on.

18
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,040
I used to.

19
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,080
I used to be the guy that was always like, just use DD.

20
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:31,800
It's built in.

21
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,400
Yeah.

22
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,640
I like seeing the transfer rate, the progress bar.

23
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,360
And I like just a little bit extra double check

24
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,160
that I'm selecting the right media, because that one time,

25
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,480
I overwrote the wrong thing.

26
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:42,920
You know what I mean?

27
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,920
Yeah, I mean, you're going to have to choose right.

28
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,040
Otherwise, you might have to go run an LS bulk, right?

29
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,160
Go run, look for what drive you want.

30
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,920
You might as well choose it from a dropdown.

31
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,240
Yeah, exactly.

32
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,160
See, I've just been piping DD through PV, which

33
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,640
gives you the progress bar and stuff, which is quite nice.

34
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,200
Ha, I knew somebody would say it.

35
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,240
Am I the only one who uses gnome disks?

36
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,200
Oh, yeah, that's right.

37
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,880
I actually just got into the habit of using Etcher,

38
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,560
I think, before gnome disks added that, maybe?

39
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,320
I say that, but I'm not so sure.

40
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,200
Gnome disk is really nice, too, because you can also

41
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,720
benchmark your disk right within the app.

42
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,440
Right.

43
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,560
Yeah, that's the other thing we don't talk about very much.

44
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,280
What are you looking at?

45
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:21,840
You looking at it?

46
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,440
I just don't run up gnome disks.

47
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,840
How does the imaging thing look?

48
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,800
I don't know.

49
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,600
Let's see.

50
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,160
Does it look better than Etcher?

51
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,400
I don't actually know how to do it.

52
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,400
The three dots in the top right of the disk should be.

53
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,920
Yeah, select the drive, go to the three button menu,

54
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,960
and do Restore Disk Image.

55
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,320
Aha, there you go.

56
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,520
It's very macOS.

57
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,840
OK, not bad, not bad.

58
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,160
Choose an image to restore, go browse for it.

59
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,880
It's built in.

60
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,380
Yeah.

61
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,480
So there you go.

62
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,320
If you need something that's going

63
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,400
to show you the layout of the disk anyway, I mean,

64
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:50,960
there you go.

65
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,760
That's nice.

66
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,840
If that's not a strong Westpain endorsement,

67
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,240
I don't know what is.

68
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,160
Put that on the box.

69
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,640
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

70
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:10,240
Hello, friends, and welcome into Linux Unplugged, episode 325.

71
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,920
My name is Chris.

72
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,600
My name is Wes.

73
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,240
Hello, Wes.

74
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,160
Hello.

75
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,800
We have so much show today that we've

76
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,200
been referring to the show notes as a novel.

77
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,280
It's packed full of news and our first take

78
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,800
on Fedora 31, which lands today as we record.

79
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,560
Don't worry, there are some romantic subplots, though.

80
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,080
That's right.

81
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,640
There are a few twists and turns.

82
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,680
We'll get you binging in no time.

83
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,320
And to help us get through all of this is our crew.

84
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,480
Hello to Alex, Drew, and Cheesy.

85
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,200
Hello, guys.

86
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,520
Hello, internet.

87
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,720
Hello, a panel that's going to help us get through today's

88
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,760
show, and then, of course, our secret sauce, our community,

89
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,840
our virtual lug.

90
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,560
Time-appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

91
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,060
Hello.

92
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:51,560
Hello.

93
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,680
Hello.

94
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,240
Look at that.

95
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,200
It's nice to have everyone in there.

96
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:55,880
Really nice.

97
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,740
So I thought we'd start with something

98
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,240
we don't do too often, but maybe should do a little more of now

99
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,200
that I think about it.

100
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,080
And that's a little bit of follow-up.

101
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,000
Sirzlol on Twitter said, hey, Chris, quick question.

102
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,740
What's the device you've been using for your external GPU

103
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,880
on your laptop?

104
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,240
Is it a breakaway box?

105
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,100
Is it some sort of PCI pass-through?

106
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:14,940
How does it connect?

107
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,160
What's the deals?

108
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,640
And I realized I hadn't really talked about my eGPU much.

109
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,320
We did an episode on it, I don't know, ages ago.

110
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,200
I'm pretty sure it was 17 years.

111
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:24,760
Sounds right.

112
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,440
Does that sound right to you?

113
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,000
I think that was 17 years ago.

114
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,680
And I then kind of changed the way I'm using it

115
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,120
and never really followed up.

116
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,640
Yeah, right.

117
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,520
I mean, last time we talked, you were doing the whole pass-through

118
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,800
thing, like a dedicated gaming VM that you would set aside

119
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,720
your fancy chip and then pass it through there.

120
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,520
Yeah.

121
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,820
That's not what you're doing now.

122
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,940
No, that was a lot of work.

123
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,120
I mean, that was amazing, because I could have like.

124
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,660
It sounded like it worked very well.

125
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,920
I had the Ubuntu setup that had all the games installed in one VM.

126
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,840
I would just move it around.

127
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,240
But truth be told, I wanted something

128
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,600
that was a little simpler.

129
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,120
You're lazy.

130
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,000
And a little faster.

131
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,960
And a little easier.

132
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,440
Yeah.

133
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,200
So it turns out it's stupid easy just

134
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,000
to run another application on an external GPU

135
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
and still have it render on your main screen.

136
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So you can just have the two GPUs right there

137
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,800
in the host system.

138
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,920
You don't have to virtualize at all.

139
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,540
I didn't really appreciate how simple this would be to pull off.

140
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,440
But what works on my system is I've got my T480.

141
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,840
It has Thunderbolt 3, which is a USB-C style connector.

142
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,120
That goes into what I got is a Mantis Venus.

143
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,200
A Mantis Venus?

144
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,700
I'll put a link in the show notes so you can just get the.

145
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,340
It's a nicer, bigger eGPU box.

146
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,080
But it also has USB.

147
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,800
It has a slot for an SSD.

148
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,080
Like it's a larger box that I use for other things.

149
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,320
But they have different sizes.

150
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,040
Some that have GPUs pre-built in.

151
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,360
Some where you can put your own GPU in and maybe

152
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,560
replace it once a year.

153
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,640
So a well-established market here.

154
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,160
And really, it's compatible with any PCI Express

155
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,160
GPU that fits in the box.

156
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,680
So you could get years of upgrading your GPU out

157
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,880
of this thing and moving it between any system that's

158
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,080
Thunderbolt 3.

159
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,320
So the way it works is when you plug in a second GPU to Linux,

160
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,880
it just registers as another PCI device on the system.

161
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,960
Zero is your default GPU, and one is the second GPU.

162
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,040
And you can pass an environment variable

163
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,680
to an application that just says,

164
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,320
use the second GPU in the system.

165
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,440
And in the case of Steam, if you were

166
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,040
to pass that environment variable and launch Steam,

167
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,760
every sub-process that Steam executes also

168
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,320
executes on that second GPU.

169
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,520
So that's exactly what I do.

170
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,080
So you've just done.

171
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,440
I mean, you launch Steam and then play games.

172
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,000
I launch Steam on that second GPU, and I play my games.

173
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,240
Proton doesn't matter.

174
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,080
Doesn't matter if they're Windows games or native Linux

175
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,860
games.

176
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,520
And they all just render on that GPU.

177
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,720
But thanks to the great development

178
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,400
of all of this lower-level technology,

179
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,840
they still work on my main screen.

180
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,160
I don't have to have a monitor hooked up to that GPU.

181
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,080
That's so cool.

182
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,480
It's so cool.

183
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,400
So I have a nice, portable, high-battery-life laptop

184
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,800
until I sit down and plug in this eGPU, which also provides

185
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,960
my magic enhancement box.

186
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,080
It's like a booster.

187
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,360
It's like an upgrade.

188
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,760
I'm like Bane sucking up the juice.

189
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,600
And the thing is, it's also providing power,

190
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,480
so it's one cable.

191
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,280
One cable.

192
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,480
And I get all of this.

193
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,600
Yeah.

194
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,480
And so I passed all of this over Twitter to Sirzlul

195
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,240
over the last week.

196
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,360
He said he got one, and he's freaking loving it.

197
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:28,860
Oh, nice.

198
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,240
And what I want to be clear about

199
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,920
is, I went all crazy with the PCI

200
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,920
pass-through and setting up a VM and having a dedicated

201
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,380
keyboard, monitor, and mouse.

202
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,800
I thought that was the way I wanted to go.

203
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,640
This is way better.

204
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,600
It's so much simpler just to say, run on GPU 1,

205
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,200
execute the application, and then just.

206
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,120
Otherwise, I admit it just sits there idle.

207
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,840
Nothing's using that GPU unless I

208
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,200
pass that environment variable.

209
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,960
But that's a trade-off I'm fine with.

210
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,800
Use the Intel GPU for my Wayland session, my Gnome shell,

211
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,480
all of those local applications that I'm using, like my browser.

212
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,840
Use the Intel GPU for that.

213
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,520
It just works.

214
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,160
Yeah.

215
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,720
So if you've been thinking about it,

216
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,960
if you've got a box that's got Thunderbolt 3,

217
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,880
and you've looked at these eGPUs,

218
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,800
I'm here to tell you that Linux is actually

219
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,040
easier to use than you expect.

220
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,040
Because it gets a little trickier

221
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,680
if you've got to load the Nvidia binary driver.

222
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,320
But you should have known that going in.

223
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,800
There's always that caveat.

224
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,340
But if you're just using stuff that's built into the kernel,

225
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,400
like the AMD driver, super easy.

226
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,640
But it is totally doable with the Nvidia, too.

227
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,720
I've done it with the Nvidia graphics card as well.

228
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,600
So whichever your preference, it will work.

229
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,200
And it's much, much simpler.

230
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,320
And also, just a little shout out to Ubuntu Mate,

231
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,280
which makes this even easier because it

232
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,320
wraps graphical commands and menu items around.

233
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,560
Of course.

234
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,760
I'm always thinking of stuff like that.

235
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,040
So I'm just thrilled with the setup, thrilled with it.

236
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,440
So if you have been on the fence and want

237
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,080
to add a little bit of oomph to your Linux box

238
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,760
without having to buy a dedicated gaming machine.

239
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,080
Yeah, that's expensive.

240
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,640
And also, it's such a trade-off.

241
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,960
Because I considered it recently.

242
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,760
It's heavier.

243
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,960
It gets worse battery.

244
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,720
It runs hotter all the time.

245
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,360
It doesn't fit on the airplane tray.

246
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,480
There's all these downsides.

247
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,200
Plus, it takes up more room in my bag.

248
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,800
I'm already fond of the ThinkPad.

249
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,120
And I only want a game, like, I mean, realistically,

250
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,160
twice a month, maybe.

251
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,360
And so that's why this is nice.

252
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,840
Because I can keep buying the cheaper laptops

253
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,840
with the sole requirement they have Thunderbolt

254
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,480
and just move this between them.

255
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,720
So anyway, Serzlul, I'm glad to hear it's working out for you.

256
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,800
And I encourage others out there to give it a go.

257
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,400
I wonder if Lenovo will ever consider doing something

258
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,680
like that with a dock.

259
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,840
Dude, I have one.

260
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,240
I have a Lenovo GPU dock that has an Nvidia graphics card

261
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,680
in it.

262
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,760
I don't like it as much.

263
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,000
It's a little underwhelming.

264
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,080
Oh, OK.

265
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,800
Yeah.

266
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,000
The bigger boxes, as you would expect, cool better.

267
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,920
Right, of course.

268
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,040
The smaller little, like, put it all in one really small

269
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,840
Thunderbolt dock, it's a great idea,

270
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,640
especially if you don't have a lot of gaming use,

271
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,800
but you just want GPU for some reason.

272
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,440
It's great.

273
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,520
But if you start pushing it really hard, it overheats.

274
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,200
And it throttles.

275
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,960
And then it eventually locks up your system.

276
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,640
And then you got a hard reboot.

277
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,480
That's just a bad experience.

278
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,840
Yeah, it's a bad experience.

279
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,940
So I do like the slightly bigger boxes.

280
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,640
I find using AMD graphics to be simpler,

281
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,560
although it's totally doable with Nvidia, too.

282
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,640
I just find it simpler with AMD.

283
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,040
Yeah.

284
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,960
There's your follow up.

285
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,560
Oh, I like it.

286
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,400
We did it, Wes.

287
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,280
OK, you've probably pushed me over the line here,

288
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,920
because I've got a box that I don't use that much,

289
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,040
because it's a separate machine with an older graphics card.

290
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,920
Not too old to knit in.

291
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,640
You've got one sitting in front of you, too.

292
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,480
You could hook it up to that laptop right there.

293
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,320
Perfect.

294
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,800
You know, Steam sales come and go.

295
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,240
You grab a few games.

296
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,640
But you also, there's other things

297
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,080
you do that could benefit from GPU acceleration.

298
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,080
Indeed, that's true.

299
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,760
You madman.

300
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,180
Well, last week, Purism's former CTO

301
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:51,480
made news in an exclusive interview with Feronix.

302
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,600
Interview seemed pretty damning, but we

303
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,360
chose to not really cover that story,

304
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,080
because there's things like that that

305
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,080
come and go when you're building something like this.

306
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,620
But this week, a story did come up we decided to talk about.

307
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,360
This week, the Librem 5 is making news,

308
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,560
with an update on the Aspen batch.

309
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,400
Listeners, you'll remember that they're shipping the Librem 5

310
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,040
in batches, each batch iteratively getting better.

311
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,960
And the coverage around the initial batch

312
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,600
was super positive.

313
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,600
It's out there.

314
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,820
Ars Technica went to the web and wrote,

315
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:26,720
the Librem 5 is becoming an actual real product.

316
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,220
Headline, Librem 5 phone starts shipping a fully open GNU

317
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,500
slash Linux phone.

318
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,120
Well, that was not actually the case.

319
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,880
Now that we are past the deadline for the Aspen batch,

320
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,200
it turns out that only a few Purism employees

321
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,000
ever received a phone or their board member.

322
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,400
In fact, maybe only three or four phones exist in total.

323
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,860
So now we're at a point where we need

324
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,780
to sort through what Purism is claiming

325
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,140
and what the community is observing.

326
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,880
And they are getting further and further apart,

327
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,160
so I needed somebody who's followed this closely.

328
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,720
Jay, welcome to the show.

329
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,400
And Jay, you've been a little obsessive about this topic,

330
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,160
haven't you?

331
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:07,960
I have.

332
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:13,480
I had pretty high hopes for this device, and I still do, honestly.

333
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,800
It's hard to find the signal through all the noise that's

334
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,080
coming out of Purism.

335
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,920
You and I are both Purism customers.

336
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,720
I was a backer of the Librem 15, and you, until just recently,

337
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,240
were a backer of the Librem 5.

338
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,960
Yeah.

339
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,000
And I also have a Librem M15.

340
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,760
That's very hard to say for some reason,

341
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,480
but I have one of their laptops now.

342
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,720
Yeah, so we're both current Librem laptop users.

343
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,180
And I think both of us are on the same page

344
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,280
when I say we would love to see this be successful.

345
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,860
Even still, the Librem 5 would love to see this be successful.

346
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,320
That doesn't necessarily mean there

347
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,240
aren't things that raise concerns.

348
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,640
Oh, yeah, definitely.

349
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,320
So I've been following this, but not as closely as you have.

350
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,000
So I wanted to bring you on to kind of go

351
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,920
through some of this.

352
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,560
So you walk us through what seems

353
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,680
to be the root cause of the most latest delay of the Librem 5.

354
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:11,400
Well, I've been gifted with some information

355
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,400
from informed people.

356
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,440
And according to these people I've been talking to,

357
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,720
ex-employees to be clear, they've pretty much told me

358
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,960
that Purism really is having a lot of trouble

359
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,820
wrapping their arms around this whole manufacturing thing

360
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,320
and the designing of the hardware and whatnot.

361
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,600
I mean, Purism, when it came to the laptops,

362
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,200
they outsourced a huge amount of that work.

363
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,960
And they did some really great work

364
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,680
in terms of the software with the Intel management

365
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,840
engine and core boot and all that.

366
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,180
But most of those laptops, I think, I want to say,

367
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,720
I heard somewhere that they're really just an Acer laptop

368
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,280
shell.

369
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:54,040
And they order it from somebody else in San Francisco.

370
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,720
And those people are doing most of the heavy lifting.

371
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,120
But with the phone, they didn't really have that option.

372
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,840
So they had to kind of go to the mat and get into the nitty

373
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,040
gritty where they weren't used to getting into before.

374
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,880
And I think that they don't have a lot of experience

375
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,360
with this kind of thing, especially

376
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,000
when it comes to phones and cellular transmissions

377
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,560
and things.

378
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,220
And I think that's probably a huge amount of the root

379
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,360
cause of a lot of the issues.

380
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,160
It's getting harder to argue that point.

381
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,640
I have taken a wait and see approach with this thing.

382
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,200
I keep waiting for data points.

383
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,360
But I do have to admit, every time something

384
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,520
is missed that is somewhat kind of obvious to the community,

385
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,160
or a deadline or a commitment is missed,

386
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,760
or something that's said that doesn't seem quite right

387
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,440
comes out, I kind of do ratchet up

388
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,400
the old skepticism another small notch.

389
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,540
And so it's now a few notches in at this point.

390
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,140
And my wait and see approach is still holding.

391
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,740
But the data points are starting to build a narrative that

392
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,520
doesn't look good.

393
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,240
And I'll tell you one that really kind of rattled me

394
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,760
is I was giving them a much, much, much more benefit

395
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,520
of the doubt kind of approach a few months ago.

396
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,120
Oh, it was about a year ago, maybe,

397
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,720
when the quote unquote final board pictures

398
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,320
were starting to surface on Mastodon.

399
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,760
And they were big.

400
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,080
And they were like clearly developer boards.

401
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,560
And so it seemed, to me, it's like,

402
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,400
well, these are really rough at this point.

403
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,360
But I was getting lots of messages from people

404
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,760
on Telegram saying, hey, look at this, look at that.

405
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,220
This is going to be a thermal issue.

406
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,360
This is going to be an interference issue.

407
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,600
And they were identifying stuff just

408
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,900
by looking at these pictures with a board on the table.

409
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,260
And I kind of just set all that aside,

410
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,640
didn't really even bring it up on air,

411
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,240
because benefit of the doubt appears.

412
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,520
And they likely know what they're doing.

413
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,640
They're testing this thing.

414
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,840
They're working the firmware.

415
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,880
They got this thing figured out.

416
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,760
But then the Aspen batch was delayed.

417
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,460
Only a handful of units ever were made.

418
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,120
And they have thermal issues.

419
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,280
Exactly like people said they would,

420
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,200
in exactly the way people said they would.

421
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,000
And purism's solution is even the solution

422
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,880
people said they'd have to come up with, which

423
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,120
is going to be super difficult.

424
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,920
And now we're starting to see that again

425
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,320
with their approach to solving the antenna issues.

426
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,860
Because you have a bunch of individuals

427
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,320
that are in the industry.

428
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,120
And so they're following the Librem 5 as a bit of a hobby.

429
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,960
This thing is fascinating to them, because they

430
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,640
work with these components.

431
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,200
They build the ATM machines and the IoT devices

432
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,360
that use these parts.

433
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,600
And so they're fascinated to see a company try

434
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,680
to make a phone out of it.

435
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,160
And they're very familiar with how all this stuff works.

436
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,400
So people seem to be seeing some of these issues

437
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,600
from thousands of miles away by just looking at the pictures.

438
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,880
Yeah, and don't forget that they've

439
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,640
got a number of other issues that are in play here

440
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,480
from a hardware standpoint.

441
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,640
So if you look at the latest videos

442
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,600
that the Linux gamers put out, he's

443
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,960
got three videos with Todd Weaver where they, you know,

444
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,360
Todd came to his house, presumably in Maine.

445
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,400
And he had two phones with him, and he let him play with it.

446
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,960
And they tore it down, and they put it back together.

447
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,800
Well, as part of that video, he actually

448
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,000
admits to a lot of the hardware deficiencies

449
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,840
that they somewhat admitted to in the Supply and the Demand

450
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,480
blog post that you referenced.

451
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,280
And among those were, you know, the camera

452
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,280
doesn't work right now.

453
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,800
Bluetooth doesn't work.

454
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,400
There's maybe a thermal throttling issue,

455
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,640
but it's not that big a deal.

456
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,520
And we're going to add a heat pipe.

457
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:23,600
And he did actually mention the antennas there as well.

458
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,200
The next version of the case would have

459
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,240
the antennas built into it.

460
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,160
And yeah, so there's a variety of these issues

461
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,640
that just keep coming up.

462
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,240
And then in addition to that, there's

463
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,720
also in the public issues tracker,

464
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,960
there are current open bugs regarding call audio issues.

465
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,480
So there's an issue with call audio echo.

466
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,040
Like when you speak into the phone,

467
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,000
you can hear your own voice being pumped back to you.

468
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,040
And then there's an issue with lag.

469
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,440
And of course, some of this will be resolved over time.

470
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,120
Oh, yeah.

471
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,000
I think what it all comes down to is two core issues here.

472
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,600
A lack of transparency around what the current hurdles are.

473
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,360
Another example is, let's be really clear,

474
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:09,040
like a matrix style clear on what blobs are required.

475
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,480
Does the Wi-Fi require firmware?

476
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,120
Does Bluetooth?

477
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,080
Does the modem?

478
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,160
What about booting?

479
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,120
Do those all require binary blobs?

480
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,400
I'd like to see a matrix of what works, what's free,

481
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,240
what's open.

482
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,440
Let's be really clear about those limitations.

483
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,680
Let's be really clear about how well this thing's going

484
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,600
to work as an actual phone.

485
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,560
If I get in a car accident, can I call for help?

486
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,640
I really need to know that.

487
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,160
So there's a lack of transparency

488
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,600
that just causes suspicion.

489
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,760
That's core issue number one.

490
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,560
And the second core issue that I am observing

491
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,400
is that purism refers to some of these challenges

492
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,680
in terms that seem to simplify them.

493
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,440
Imminently solvable challenges is a direct quote

494
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,400
from their recent blog post.

495
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,960
And then electrical engineers and developers

496
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,880
of other mobile platforms, they look at the problem.

497
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,400
They go, that is a very, very unique challenge.

498
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,240
To the antenna specifically, a lot of what I'm hearing

499
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,480
is, well, that needed to be designed into the case

500
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,720
when you designed your case.

501
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,800
Like you had to have that figured out seven steps ago.

502
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,440
Not something that you're just going to imminently solve.

503
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,240
So some of these problems are much more challenging

504
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,160
than they're making them appear on the surface.

505
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,480
And that, again, goes back to the transparency,

506
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,360
but also leads people to doubt their future statements.

507
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,760
And then when these things play out

508
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,000
to be true, like the CPU throttling issue,

509
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,720
like the thermal issue, like the antenna issue,

510
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,400
and it seems to have caught them by surprise

511
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,880
and delayed the batch, you do wonder

512
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,680
if perhaps they don't have a good grasp

513
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,840
on the challenge of this.

514
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,080
Right.

515
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,680
That's kind of what it makes it feel like.

516
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,440
I mean, no, it's OK.

517
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,900
We know that they had to figure a lot of things out, right?

518
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,120
That's part of the challenge here.

519
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,640
But we're hearing about it in these overblown terms that

520
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,080
don't seem to match with reality.

521
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,840
And it's taken a long time to become clear

522
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,720
about what actually is current.

523
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,120
I think we can all accept that there's going to be blobs,

524
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,620
but we need to know what they are so we

525
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,880
can be real about the product.

526
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,160
Well, I think part of the problem here is that,

527
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,480
especially as I've heard from some of the people who

528
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,560
were inside the company that I've been chatting with,

529
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,560
is that there's a difference really

530
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:18,200
between purism as a whole and then what the CEO does and says.

531
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,160
I mean, if you start paying attention,

532
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,600
you'll notice that the CEO is the one pushing out

533
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,560
a lot of these updates and a lot of these posts.

534
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,280
And as I understand it, there's a culture issue here

535
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,440
in terms of when people come to him and they say, look,

536
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,680
this may not be entirely accurate,

537
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,880
he is not particularly receptive to that kind of feedback.

538
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,600
Well, Jay, I want to share with you

539
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,320
my motivations on why I've dug into this, how I found you,

540
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:47,160
and all of that, because I think it's important for the audience

541
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,460
to hear this.

542
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,760
I really believe that the free software community

543
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,160
is filled with optimists in a good way.

544
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,160
I mean, why else would we be fighting for the things

545
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,680
that we do?

546
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,920
And we believe in this stuff.

547
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,360
And I think that's really great, and I

548
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,160
think it's really important that it stays that way.

549
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,720
I think it leads to a very common, well,

550
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,640
you've got to give them the benefit of the doubt syndrome.

551
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,880
Yeah, you've got to give them the benefit of the doubt.

552
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,480
What they're trying to do is real hard,

553
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,560
and it's going to slip a little bit,

554
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,300
but their intentions are super good,

555
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,560
so you've got to give them the benefit of the doubt.

556
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,320
No.

557
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,440
Well, that is the very mindset that scammers can trade upon.

558
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,200
You have to be skeptical, because the greater goal,

559
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,440
the quote unquote movement, is more important.

560
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,640
And if they ruin this, it will set humanity back.

561
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,000
Yeah, I agree.

562
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,600
I mean, I think from my perspective,

563
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,840
the entire free and open source software movement,

564
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,040
it's about freedom, transparency,

565
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,840
and empowering users.

566
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,200
And it's hard for me to get to a place

567
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,920
mentally where I can see how a process that doesn't embody

568
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,560
any of those standards and doesn't take on any

569
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,240
of those principles can give us a device that's

570
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,560
supposed to be the ultimate representation

571
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,720
of those principles.

572
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,440
Right.

573
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,040
We don't need NeoApple.

574
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,360
We need transparency.

575
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,720
Well, Jay, you have three really thorough blog posts

576
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,800
about this.

577
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,520
Also, you follow this in other, you are, I should say,

578
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,080
active in other outlets that discuss this,

579
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,440
and you've really done some good observations.

580
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,920
I know you've been speaking with folks at the company,

581
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,040
and I just really appreciate that you've

582
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,080
taken a balance for you.

583
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,080
You're not hating on them.

584
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,500
You and I both would love to see this thing be successful,

585
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,040
because we both appreciate how important it is.

586
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,680
But you're also staying skeptical.

587
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,560
And I think you've done a good job of telling

588
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,080
the more complete story than what

589
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,600
we could touch on in a segment for this show.

590
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,680
So I have a link to your blog, jaylittle.com,

591
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,720
in the show notes.

592
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,400
And just keep an eye on things.

593
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,240
Maybe you and I can chat again in the future

594
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,720
if something significant develops.

595
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,600
Yeah, definitely.

596
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,520
I'd like that.

597
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,320
Thanks, Jay.

598
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,160
Thanks.

599
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,360
I'll try to put links to as many of the things

600
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,160
as we talked about quickly mentioned in that chat

601
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,160
in the show notes.

602
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,160
And going back to the point of transparency,

603
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,840
which I think is the key takeaway on this,

604
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,600
I think it's such an opportunity for them

605
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,080
to set the bar on this, to really lead the way.

606
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,320
Purism, they talk about the Libra and Five

607
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:30,840
as the beginning of an ethical movement.

608
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,760
Movement is a big term, and I think they might be right.

609
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:40,320
And so I think because that movement is so important,

610
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,880
it's worth their time, even when they're

611
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,240
busy solving antenna issues and trying to build something new,

612
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,160
it's worth their time to be more transparent.

613
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,080
Set up a nice matrix of what's a blob.

614
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,000
Does the Wi-Fi require a blob?

615
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,600
Does the Bluetooth?

616
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,120
What about the modem?

617
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,520
What's the boot environment like?

618
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,760
I'd like to see a chart of that.

619
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,760
Show it all to me right there in a post.

620
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,320
Really lets me know what the limitations are of this thing.

621
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,720
And that, I mean, at the same time

622
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,720
helps us be able to get behind them,

623
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,040
because we know just what's going on.

624
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,760
And I just, I was speculating with Jay.

625
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,760
I said, I wonder if really, if the right thing here wouldn't

626
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:25,280
be for Purism to work with the PinePhone folks

627
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,440
and come together on this thing in some way.

628
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,200
I mean, it would mean putting aside

629
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,040
creating the next big free product

630
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,480
and instead focusing on the overall movement.

631
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,280
But if you brought together the different talent sets,

632
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,280
I mean, you'd really have something here.

633
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,880
It's just something, I'd love to see

634
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,640
addressed because I worry that we're slipping

635
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,680
in the wrong direction on this.

636
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,080
I mean, the goal is important, and we're getting caught up

637
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,040
in the specifics right here.

638
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,600
Yeah.

639
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,000
And part of me kind of just wants them to go out and say,

640
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,240
oh, it's way worse than we've been letting you know,

641
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,000
and we need another million dollars.

642
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,040
Will you fund us?

643
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,720
And let the community just decide and say, yes.

644
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,280
We'll step up.

645
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,520
We'll do it, because it's that important.

646
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,280
But we need transparency.

647
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,480
Something has to change.

648
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,920
A lot of people have a lot of hopes on that device.

649
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,160
We'll keep an eye on it.

650
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,520
We tend to really cover it when something major changes,

651
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,240
that the real landmark thing here

652
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,440
was the end of the Aspen batch.

653
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,280
Yeah, I mean, no, you just got to stay tuned,

654
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,800
see how the additional batches go, and time will tell.

655
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,240
Time tells all stories.

656
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,160
That's been my recent thing, Wes.

657
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,800
I've been thinking about that.

658
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,720
A lot of times you get bits and pieces, but if you stick with it

659
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,640
and you're patient enough, eventually time

660
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,680
does tell all the stories.

661
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,180
Indeed.

662
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:44,520
Well, we got a super quick housekeeping.

663
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,920
It's already clean in here.

664
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,000
We should probably mention that we're

665
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,480
going to be digging into software

666
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,600
and setting up things in Fedora and all that kind of stuff.

667
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,840
You should definitely check out the Choose Linux podcast.

668
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,560
Do it.

669
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,720
Drew, here's one of the three co-hosts of that there show.

670
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,980
And he can probably tell you on some authority

671
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,760
that software, Linux, and installations

672
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,280
will be a topic on a future show.

673
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,320
Huh?

674
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:07,920
Yeah.

675
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,840
Coming out Thursday, we're going to talk about Chaos Linux, which

676
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,320
is sort of a KDE showcase.

677
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,320
And on top of that, we're going to talk about Flatpaks

678
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,840
and Snaps and all of it.

679
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,720
Flatpaks and Snaps and App Images, oh, my.

680
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,640
And what are the different experiences of them like,

681
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,280
really, especially from different perspectives?

682
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:32,720
I also want to give a shout out to Ubicon Europe, wrapped up,

683
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,520
and now their YouTube channel is loaded up

684
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,880
with some of their presentations,

685
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,000
I think most of them.

686
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,640
So we'll have a link to that in the show notes,

687
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,960
or you can just go Google search Ubicon Europe.

688
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,000
Yeah, got some good stuff, like applied security

689
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,720
for containers, or public and open source.

690
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,560
There's really a full range there, actually.

691
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,320
Yeah, totally.

692
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,040
It's actually pretty good.

693
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,440
Including stuff like Ubuntu Wellness.

694
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,200
What's that about?

695
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:51,880
Yeah.

696
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,340
And last but not least, I'll just

697
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,680
mention, if you love our shows, be

698
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,920
sure you check out the new Headlines podcast.

699
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,040
This is, I think, this is us at our best now.

700
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,000
Oh, yeah.

701
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,500
So if you like what we do, I really

702
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,000
encourage you to go check out the new Headlines show.

703
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,840
Every weekday, Linux Headlines in three minutes or less.

704
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,180
Wes did one today.

705
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,320
I did one on Monday.

706
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,280
We do kind of a handoff system.

707
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,960
But what's even cooler about it is, behind the scenes,

708
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,040
we've really staffed it out.

709
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,880
We've got people that are dedicated to research.

710
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,240
We do cross-checking.

711
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,480
We all are very involved in the process.

712
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,000
Not only is it a full team effort,

713
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,520
but it's one that we've taken very seriously.

714
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,560
And we've made it available for your Amazon LadyTube.

715
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,760
That's right.

716
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,520
I got to get it outside the US.

717
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,480
I haven't done that yet.

718
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,320
It's complicated.

719
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,080
Their UI is horrible.

720
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,320
It's just horrible, but it is on there.

721
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,880
LinuxHeadlines.show, though, if you just want to go check it

722
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,080
out, it's, I think, some of our best work.

723
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,280
Three minutes or less.

724
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,220
Fedora 31 lands today.

725
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:58,760
It features Linux kernel 5.3, mason 9.2, GCC 9.21,

726
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:05,240
GNOME 3.34, Perl 5.30, and probably most importantly,

727
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,720
it doesn't see any Python 2.

728
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,640
No.

729
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,920
They removed it.

730
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,640
It's gone now.

731
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,400
Don't need it.

732
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,640
Yeah, it actually does change things a little bit.

733
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,140
I was doing some benchmarking that required Python 2 scripts,

734
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,920
and I felt like an old man.

735
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,680
Also, no root log on for you anymore

736
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,960
if you're connecting over SSH.

737
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,760
They've been disabled by default.

738
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,360
And then brace yourself, kiddos, because these next two

739
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,460
are the biggies.

740
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:33,160
They've switched to cgroups version 2 by default.

741
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,400
We'll come back to that.

742
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,720
And they've removed the i6-86 repositories.

743
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,120
And also, I think they're not even making bootable images.

744
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:42,960
That's a big change.

745
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,200
But let's talk about that cgroups thing,

746
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,520
because cgroups, Wes, isn't that containers?

747
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,100
And isn't everything using cgroups version 1?

748
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,680
How can you just switch to version 2?

749
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,560
Well, it depends on what container runtime

750
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,880
you're using, of course.

751
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,200
But for you, I know that's Docker.

752
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,080
And the Docker binary you're going to run right now

753
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,740
expects cgroups v1.

754
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,560
So that's probably the biggest, uh-oh,

755
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,060
why isn't this working sort of problem

756
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,160
you're going to run into right off the bat.

757
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,480
You just need to go add a kernel command line flag.

758
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,560
It'll switch that off.

759
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,720
You'll still get cgroups v1.

760
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,080
They can coexist at the same time.

761
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:13,580
Yeah.

762
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,160
Then it works.

763
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,920
Yeah, it's still possible to run version 1.

764
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:21,280
Now, sometime this year, maybe next year,

765
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,360
we should see Docker working.

766
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,240
And other runtimes already support it.

767
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,300
So if you're using Podman, away you go.

768
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:30,920
Including cgroups v2 brings a better rootless container

769
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,920
support, which integrates with the new API.

770
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,600
That's just what I was going to ask you.

771
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,200
So that's why.

772
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,800
That's really the big thing you gain from this.

773
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,760
It's just a cleanup of cgroups.

774
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,240
I mean, cgroups were a new idea in the kernel community

775
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,400
as we were exploring how to group and contain

776
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,400
all these processes.

777
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,680
Turns out you don't always get everything right

778
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,400
the first time.

779
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,640
So got to fix it up.

780
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,440
It will be painful.

781
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:56,280
But Fedora's doing what Fedora does best,

782
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,200
and putting their toe in the water

783
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,080
and saying, it's going to break some things,

784
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,480
but we're making the switch.

785
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,040
In fact, they almost kind of say exactly.

786
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,440
That's the rationale on the wiki.

787
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,080
Yeah, that's why they're doing it.

788
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,880
Somebody's got to do it.

789
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,040
No one's doing it.

790
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,160
And this was cgroups version 2 was finalized years ago.

791
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,240
So yeah, exactly.

792
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,640
I mean, I think it's been non-experimental since 2015.

793
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,520
And I think that is true to some extent, right?

794
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,920
I mean, it does change when you're a legitimate Linux

795
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,000
desktop user, and you can go file bugs on other projects

796
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,200
saying, your project is broken for me now.

797
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,080
Of course, they have a bunch of ARM support,

798
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,240
but Raspberry Pi 4 I don't think landed officially.

799
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,760
Darn.

800
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,040
Not that I saw.

801
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,880
But that's OK.

802
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,840
That's all right.

803
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,840
That's fine.

804
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,240
We did have some fun, since we had just recently done

805
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,360
some benchmarks on stock Ubuntu 19.10.

806
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,560
We ran some benchmarks on stock Fedora 31.

807
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,360
Just did a little comparing.

808
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,640
I mean, once you've got the Ferronix tests,

809
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,440
we'd install them.

810
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,520
It's crazy.

811
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,640
Nothing really all that interesting to report.

812
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,400
Ubuntu is faster, I'd say, in the overall takeaway.

813
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,960
But there are some areas where Fedora pulled ahead.

814
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,560
Typical benchmark.

815
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,600
If you're interested at all, though, we'll

816
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,740
have a link in the show notes.

817
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:03,840
Not all the benchmarks were fully ran on Fedora either,

818
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,680
which is kind of a comment about running software

819
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,800
on Fedora versus Ubuntu in a meta way.

820
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,520
It's not so bad.

821
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,800
I mean, it's really not.

822
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,440
But like, OK, you're running some random script

823
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,440
you found on the internet or from the readme of a GitHub

824
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,080
page.

825
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,000
They almost always have Ubuntu packages.

826
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,960
You don't always get Fedora.

827
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:26,160
Well, OK, so let's talk about setting up Fedora 31.

828
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,680
I think a couple of years ago, maybe, maybe even a year ago,

829
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,680
I don't know.

830
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,600
I don't know.

831
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,360
It's ish.

832
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,640
Let's just say ish.

833
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,840
It was good advice to say, wait a few days, maybe a week or two,

834
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,920
before you upgrade to the next Fedora release.

835
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,920
You go back a little bit further in time,

836
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,260
the advice was wait maybe a month or two

837
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,100
before you upgrade to the next Fedora release.

838
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,160
That's legitimately how it went.

839
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,240
Boy, has that changed.

840
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,800
Now, I'm not advocating anybody do like Chris do or Wes

841
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,200
or all of us on the show.

842
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,800
But I upgraded to Fedora 31 yesterday,

843
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,800
which was the day before release.

844
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:08,160
Because a little birdie told me that the ISO is all finalized,

845
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,160
everything's good to go.

846
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,240
We're pretty much ready.

847
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,320
Yeah.

848
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,080
So I was having some problems.

849
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,080
And I thought, well, I've been running Pop OS, liked it.

850
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,440
But I had a little mouse laggy issue,

851
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,440
just a little bit of mouse stutter.

852
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,760
And it's like, eh.

853
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,200
Yeah, we know you have a low tolerance for that.

854
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,680
I have a low tolerance, I know.

855
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,400
So I thought, let's put Fedora 31 on here.

856
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:29,240
I also, because I like chaos, apparently,

857
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,440
decided let's upgrade my Lenovo ThinkPad T480,

858
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,080
which has been running like a fricking champ with Fedora

859
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,880
30 on the road in day-to-day use every single day,

860
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,120
every single night.

861
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,560
This is kind of your golden boy.

862
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,520
You've been just nothing but happy with this install.

863
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,320
So I thought, why not scroll it up

864
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,680
and let's upgrade to Fedora 31 the day before the release.

865
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,280
What could go wrong?

866
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,720
Turns out nothing.

867
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,540
Yeah, nothing, nothing.

868
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,600
I had to uninstall Crossover Office, unfortunately.

869
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,560
And I had to uninstall, I think, Lavish, was it?

870
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,360
Two packages.

871
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,280
Yeah.

872
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,160
Not much, though.

873
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,280
It was kind of surprising.

874
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:12,160
And the whole process sort of rekindled for us,

875
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,040
I think, what we really like about Fedora.

876
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,520
I went digging around in some of the scripts running

877
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,320
behind the scenes to do the system upgrade

878
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,640
and how that integrates with DNF.

879
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,100
And Fedora's just so clean and modern.

880
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,240
It's a fresh, well-put-together Linux machine.

881
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:34,760
Oh, the peak experience for me, I did the little dash dash

882
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:39,020
release equals 31 to change over to the new version.

883
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:43,160
And the RPM Fusion folks thought of this ahead of time.

884
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,880
And so it just automatically follows

885
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,080
whatever you set that release version to.

886
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,360
So the next time DNF did an update,

887
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,540
I was just automatically getting the RPM Fusion 31 repos.

888
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,680
And to their credit, those repos were already up

889
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,560
and ready to go.

890
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,120
Yeah.

891
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,960
Same with a couple of copper repositories I was using.

892
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,680
Already had their 31 copper repositories up.

893
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,000
It's so easy, because then the rest of it

894
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,800
is all covered with flat packs.

895
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,360
Right.

896
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,120
That doesn't really change.

897
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,760
You just got to make sure you still have flat pack.

898
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,440
They don't care.

899
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,240
Yeah.

900
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:18,440
And so I took a heavily modified dual desktop,

901
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,480
because I had XSC on there, too, and Nome Show.

902
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,560
Tons of crazy jack stuff we've done, my eGPU experiments,

903
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,240
my PCI Passer experiments, all the things

904
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:34,720
I've been doing to this machine since Fedora 30 came out.

905
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,920
And it all just went up to 31 flawlessly.

906
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:41,040
Even my WireGuard bolted on WireGuard support upgraded.

907
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,880
It was a nice experience from the end user.

908
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,400
Just watching you go through it, you kind of sat down,

909
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,960
knowing that this might take a little while.

910
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,400
And that transaction test that it

911
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,720
does sort of gives you a little bit of peace of mind.

912
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,200
Yes.

913
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,520
Right.

914
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,240
You're not just sort of going off into the wild here.

915
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,200
There's some checks and boundaries.

916
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,880
Now, all that said, I have had some problems,

917
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,200
but not on my laptop.

918
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,520
So I want to make this clear.

919
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,000
This is unique, I think, to hardware setups.

920
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,880
And I've been trying to track down

921
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,760
some of these problems I've had, so much so

922
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,720
that I've looped in Wendell and Michael Larabell trying

923
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,480
to help me troubleshoot.

924
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,240
You're desperate.

925
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,080
I really am.

926
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,640
Because the mouse leg issue that I was having on Pop OS

927
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:29,720
on my main workstation got significantly worse

928
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,840
when I went to Fedora 31.

929
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,040
It got bad.

930
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,920
I had mouse leg that sometimes would last 10 seconds,

931
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,120
like where a mouse would just lock up for 10 seconds.

932
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,040
Oh, just hard lock.

933
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,460
There's other times where it's just you're using the system,

934
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:44,240
and the mouse would just leg across the screen.

935
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,000
So it would jump halfway across your screen.

936
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,480
Have you considered just switching to i3?

937
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,880
You son of a bitch.

938
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,960
So I hard bailed on Wayland.

939
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,880
Because I did a little digging, because actually, yes,

940
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,840
I am thinking about going back to plasma.

941
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,080
I did a little digging.

942
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,800
And this is a problem that is getting worked at right now.

943
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,920
There was a recent post by canonical employee Daniel

944
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,360
Van Gogh.

945
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,800
I don't know how to say his last name.

946
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,000
It's not Van Gogh.

947
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,360
Great guy, super sharp developer.

948
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,880
And he writes in this post I'll have linked in the show notes,

949
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,560
quote, the GNOME Shell and Mutter

950
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,600
are single-threaded GLib event loop apps.

951
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,640
So any pause could cause them to miss the next frame

952
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,080
and exhibit stuttering.

953
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:38,240
Some common pauses are for disk I.O. or GPU I.O.

954
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,560
But the miscalculating when to render the next frame

955
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,560
has also been an issue in GNOME Shell.

956
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,920
Here's the fun thing.

957
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,920
This, way worse on Wayland because of the architecture

958
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,480
of GNOME Shell.

959
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,200
And Chrome's a real son of a bitch

960
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,720
because it's using GPU acceleration,

961
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,600
so it's causing GPU I.O. And it's caching to your disk,

962
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:03,760
so it's causing disk I.O. So it is the perfect storm of events

963
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,080
that cause GNOME Shell to lock up.

964
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,880
So I thought, I'll go to Firefox.

965
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,120
Worse in Firefox.

966
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,680
Worse.

967
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,440
Significantly worse.

968
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,920
Unusable.

969
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,320
Can't select menu items at times.

970
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,760
Not all the time.

971
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,160
About three or four or five times an hour.

972
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,720
So it's just enough that you sort of put your guard down.

973
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,200
And then all of a sudden, boom, you're

974
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,960
hit with this horrible mouse leak.

975
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,240
It's better on X. It's like 95% better on X.

976
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,000
Workable.

977
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,520
Every now and then I get some leggy legs.

978
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,880
But it's not that bad.

979
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,040
It's nothing.

980
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,920
It's just it really stinks because, first of all,

981
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,400
the graphics card is an AMD RX 570.

982
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,640
It's got 64 gigabytes of RAM.

983
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,680
It's got six physical cores, 12 threads.

984
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,000
The main root OS is on MV and E drive.

985
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,760
My home is on a fast Intel SSD.

986
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,240
My games, my Steam games, are on a separate Intel SSD.

987
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:03,160
And all of my scratch work is on a RAID 0 of spinning rust.

988
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:06,120
All of this is on separate controllers.

989
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,760
Like, I have built this system to optimize disk I.O.

990
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,480
and performance when I'm doing lots of transactions

991
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,120
or encoding or whatever it is.

992
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,760
That's what this system's designed for.

993
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:21,680
And I'm getting a significantly smoother, better experience

994
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:27,440
on my T480 because it's single screen Intel graphics.

995
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,280
And I really think that my screen setup continues

996
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,660
to influence this because I've got three 2K monitors, two

997
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,400
of which are vertical, one is horizontal.

998
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,280
It just had to be different, didn't you?

999
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,400
And reading through the bug reports

1000
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,760
about these stuttery mouse issues, first of all,

1001
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,120
it could be caused by a million different combination

1002
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,080
of things.

1003
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:51,080
But the other thing is, it does get exponentially worse

1004
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:54,920
when you have extra monitors because of how

1005
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:58,200
the whole stack works.

1006
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,720
It has been really frustrating.

1007
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,540
Additionally, I got a new sound problem

1008
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,120
that I've never experienced before.

1009
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:05,640
Oh, no, really?

1010
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,360
Yes.

1011
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,680
This is both a good and bad.

1012
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:15,360
The bad is, say I watch a YouTube video in a browser.

1013
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:19,320
Video ends, and I choose not to listen to anything else.

1014
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,920
Five, 10 seconds go by, maybe 15 seconds,

1015
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:27,200
and I hear this audible click in my speakers.

1016
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,380
If you've ever had an optical audio connection

1017
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,080
and it goes to sleep after some inactivity,

1018
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,080
it sounds just like this.

1019
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,880
Only this is a standard, regular old audio cable.

1020
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:42,800
Once it goes to sleep, my speakers buzz,

1021
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,640
and I have a pretty big subwoofer,

1022
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:49,680
so it's whoo, which is crazy distracting.

1023
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,800
So between the mouse leg and the buzz, I'm going nuts.

1024
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:58,440
However, the positive side is, unlike Pop and Ubuntu,

1025
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,160
which were constantly defaulting,

1026
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,020
even after I change it to my monitor's built-in speaker,

1027
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:06,040
which sucks, this is actually remembering my speaker

1028
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,440
selection.

1029
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,680
Yeah.

1030
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,520
You've just got to always be playing background music,

1031
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,520
and then you'll be fine.

1032
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,040
The funny thing about Fedora 31 is

1033
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:18,120
it's positioning for just this total changeout of the audio

1034
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:22,680
system and migration to PipeWire in 32 and 33,

1035
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,000
and then eventually completed in 34.

1036
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,760
They've got this long arc plan for PipeWire,

1037
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,880
and 31 is all about getting things in position for it.

1038
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,240
But there's nothing really significantly different there,

1039
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,720
so I'm not sure why I'm having these problems.

1040
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,840
However, that stuff said, I really

1041
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,800
am happy with my install.

1042
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,360
It really is quite nice.

1043
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:52,200
The underlying Fedora system remains my favorite.

1044
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:56,880
It's reminiscent of Arch in its cleanness and its tightness.

1045
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,520
Yeah, it's modern.

1046
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:03,280
It doesn't feel bogged down by a bunch of cruft or legacy.

1047
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,360
It's very logically laid out.

1048
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,560
However, it feels more like a complete product,

1049
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,320
and it stays very up to date.

1050
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,880
But with these sort of thresholds,

1051
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,320
it has almost the feel of a rolling release distribution

1052
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,680
because you get new kernels, you get new core things

1053
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:26,720
during a release, but it doesn't have the roller coaster

1054
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,000
experience that you get with the really cutting edge distros.

1055
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,280
No, I mean, you can feel comfortable using it

1056
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,360
on your workstation, as long as you know,

1057
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,280
fairly often you'll have to do an upgrade.

1058
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:42,600
I think Fedora, for me, fills the role

1059
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:46,040
that Manjaro fills for a lot of people in the Arch land.

1060
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:50,360
They want that clean, tight, professionally built

1061
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:55,600
OS with really fresh software, but maybe having a testing

1062
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,680
layer is a good thing, which Rawhide provides for Fedora.

1063
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,440
So I think there's a real common experience

1064
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,800
between a Manjaro user's preferences and experience

1065
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,440
and a Fedora user's preferences and experience.

1066
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,400
And I just happened to like the Fedora take on it,

1067
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,960
in part because it dawned on me while doing this review

1068
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,240
that I have been trying out different Red Hat desktop

1069
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,880
installs for 21 years.

1070
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,480
This marks my 21 year of trying these.

1071
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,440
And so I may just be a little more inclined

1072
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,720
to like the Red Hat version more than the Manjaro version,

1073
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,840
but I completely kind of get the appeal of it now.

1074
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,120
Well, I mean, I've been playing around with it.

1075
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,520
It just feels like a nice, modern workstation,

1076
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,400
especially if you're someone who uses Linux

1077
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,160
and also does work in the cloud or development.

1078
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,480
I love that Git is just already installed.

1079
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,720
Oh, I know.

1080
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,760
Carl, you were saying they kind of have a term for Fedora

1081
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,640
that sort of fits this description.

1082
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,880
Yes, sir.

1083
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,080
Matt, his last name's escaping me right now, Matt Diem.

1084
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,640
He calls it a semi-roll-in release.

1085
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,560
That's a good way to put it, Matthew Millian.

1086
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,880
In fact, I reached out to Matthew

1087
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,720
and invited him to come on.

1088
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,600
He's at a conference.

1089
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,040
I invited him to come on next week

1090
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,160
so after we spend another week with Fedora,

1091
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,040
we can chat with him.

1092
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,080
So come back next week to chat with him, too.

1093
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,960
So we all gave it a go.

1094
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,960
I have really grown to like Fedora as a workstation,

1095
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,480
so I wanted to really kind of spend

1096
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,040
some time to go through it.

1097
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,160
And I don't know what I'm going to do.

1098
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,160
I think I'll just hang on X, where

1099
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,600
the mouse leg is acceptable, and wait for the next GNOME

1100
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,520
release because this is something they're actively

1101
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,760
working on.

1102
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,000
What about your experience?

1103
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,560
Oh, no, it's been very solid because I've only

1104
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,000
been using it on the ThinkPad.

1105
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,880
Right, where it's glorious.

1106
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,120
And you've been using Wayland?

1107
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,760
I've been using GNOME and Wayland,

1108
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,560
and I've not yet installed Chrome either.

1109
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,520
So I've been using Firefox.

1110
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,720
Honestly, it's just been clean and minimal and kind

1111
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,360
of perfect.

1112
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,400
I mean, you and I, yesterday, we did a little bit

1113
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,160
of tweaking and playing around with GNOME themes.

1114
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,240
But other than that, it's just ready to go.

1115
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,800
And I really love that about a nice, modern workstation.

1116
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,480
It was easy to get all the software I needed to do work,

1117
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,720
to prepare for the show.

1118
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,000
So I'm kind of back up and running already.

1119
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,160
Yeah, I would say now, GNOME on Wayland

1120
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,320
takes me about 15 minutes.

1121
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,760
That's it, yep.

1122
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,040
And I could probably spend all day tweaking Plasma.

1123
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,920
I kind of enjoy it sometimes, but sometimes I

1124
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,320
don't want to bother with that.

1125
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,840
I want to talk about the installer and all of that.

1126
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,720
But Cheesy, I think this is a good chance for you

1127
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,200
to jump in, because you kind of have the freshest eyes

1128
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,280
on the Fedora installation experience.

1129
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,520
I have grown more and more familiar with Anaconda,

1130
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,880
and I know that can be a little strange for somebody that

1131
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,280
doesn't install Fedora systems all the time.

1132
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,080
Yeah, so I mean, full disclosure,

1133
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,760
I'm not an avid Fedora user.

1134
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,760
Overall, the experience has been great.

1135
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,480
So just going through the installer,

1136
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,600
one of the things that I noticed immediately

1137
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,560
was whenever you go to format your disk,

1138
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:56,000
it asks you to reclaim space, which just seems kind of weird

1139
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,440
instead of formatting.

1140
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,120
And I'm kind of used to that Ubuntu installer

1141
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:03,120
with the kind of pictogram and a short description of what

1142
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,080
you're about to do.

1143
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,520
So that was a little weird for me.

1144
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,440
So I could see a new user coming into that

1145
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,960
and maybe getting to that point and being a bit confused.

1146
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,760
Yeah, the disk partitioner stuff is a bit strange

1147
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,680
to begin with, because you've got automatic mode, which

1148
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:21,840
is still a little strange, custom,

1149
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:25,640
which is sort of like the custom partitioner in Ubuntu's

1150
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:26,160
installer.

1151
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,960
And then you have the belt or whatever

1152
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,640
it is, the more advanced one, which is a whole other disk

1153
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,280
partitioner.

1154
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,760
It's my preferred one, but it's hard to wrap your head around,

1155
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,300
even if you've done it multiple times.

1156
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,440
And here's what I can tell you.

1157
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,200
The first couple of times, because they changed this

1158
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,400
a few years ago, the first couple of times I used it,

1159
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,160
I was really very unhappy with it.

1160
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,800
The more I use it and the more I install other distros,

1161
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,880
the more I appreciate it.

1162
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,240
Because this is really the only one

1163
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:55,360
that lets me properly take advantage of my LVM setup

1164
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,360
and really kind of clearly lays out all the disks

1165
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:01,320
and lets me kind of do the more sophisticated partitioning

1166
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,900
that I want to do properly.

1167
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,480
It's the only one that will do it.

1168
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,320
And what I've noticed is the more I use it,

1169
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,680
the less offensive I find it.

1170
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,160
And I think what's happening is they

1171
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,800
have reached that phase themselves, the developers.

1172
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,280
To them, they installed Fedora, and it

1173
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,800
seems perfectly usable because they're totally used to it.

1174
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,200
But if you come in fresh, it's a weird way

1175
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,720
to lay out your disks.

1176
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,400
Even the way it, even the language it uses is strange.

1177
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,200
And constantly hitting the Done button.

1178
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,560
Double Done buttons and Reclaim buttons.

1179
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,600
And yeah, the whole thing is strange.

1180
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,920
Well, and then whenever you do that initial setup,

1181
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:40,000
you don't set up your initial user until after you reboot,

1182
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,020
which, again, was a little bit strange.

1183
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:45,760
And then whenever you boot in, the first thing you get

1184
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,320
is a Welcome to Fedora screen that you

1185
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:53,600
have to click Next on before you can begin your user and setup.

1186
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:57,120
This is kind of the new way to do it, this post-install setup.

1187
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,800
Because one of the things that System76 says,

1188
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,120
and I think elementary OS said the same thing is,

1189
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:05,040
it's a great way to then take advantage of using encryption

1190
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,500
that an OEM can ship a system, and that last phase can

1191
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:09,900
be just handled by the user.

1192
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,780
And then they can set up their own encryption password

1193
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:12,280
and stuff.

1194
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,840
So there's some advantages to it.

1195
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,540
And that's exactly how I felt about it.

1196
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:18,500
I felt that it was more of, if you're coming from Ubuntu

1197
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,120
or something like that, it was an OEM-type setup, which,

1198
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,280
you know, no harm, no foul.

1199
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,520
But then, yeah, whenever I was greeted with the Welcome

1200
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,680
to Fedora screen before setting up my user,

1201
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,080
and you just have to click Next, it

1202
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:33,200
seems like that's one step that could be alleviated just

1203
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,600
to get you right into setting up your user.

1204
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,160
So that was a little weird.

1205
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:42,080
Searching for some of the software was a little weird.

1206
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:45,920
So initially, we were trying to set up Telegram.

1207
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,080
They had the Telegram web version

1208
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:51,760
in there, which is just not good,

1209
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,600
especially if you're older like me

1210
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,580
and you need that scaling to like 125%, right,

1211
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:58,000
to kind of get it where you need it.

1212
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,920
Yes, 125% club.

1213
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,520
Exactly, man.

1214
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,200
But that didn't take much to get into Flatpak,

1215
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,520
get the Flatpak repo set up, pull down Telegram desktop

1216
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,400
without any problems, had my scaling back.

1217
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,200
So that was pretty dead simple to get going.

1218
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,160
I didn't notice, though, that whenever installing apps,

1219
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:22,000
sometimes they would seem to hang for a bit,

1220
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,840
so like two or three minutes installing without giving you

1221
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:28,320
any progress, which was kind of weird.

1222
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:32,520
I think it's like pulling down different Flatpak layers

1223
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,240
and dependencies, and they don't have a good progress

1224
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,120
signal for that.

1225
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,500
And that's exactly what I was thinking,

1226
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,880
is that it was pulling down the layers in the background

1227
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:43,480
and just not outputting that onto the progress bar for me.

1228
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,040
But initially, I got all that worked out,

1229
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,440
got everything set up.

1230
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,080
Overall, pretty stock GNOME experience.

1231
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:54,320
I do like that they had the hot corners set up out of the box,

1232
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:58,720
because that's one of the things that I do with default GNOME.

1233
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,720
I do like the Ferronix test suite was already

1234
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,160
there in the shop.

1235
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,200
So boom, I didn't have to go to the Ferronix side

1236
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,640
and pull that down.

1237
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,000
It's one version behind.

1238
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,320
I'd love to see that updated.

1239
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,720
Just saying, just a note out to the universe.

1240
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:18,520
But the fingerprint reader works just as well as it did on Ubuntu.

1241
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:24,160
So I think that's just baked into GNOME 3.34.

1242
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,600
So that works great on this little ThinkPad.

1243
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,560
Overall, I mean, it really seems like a solid distro.

1244
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,800
I would like to see maybe the Flatpak repo added

1245
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,480
into, just to give that little more extensibility

1246
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,320
to have those apps that I want.

1247
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,920
But I do understand that that could be a security concern.

1248
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,240
So that might be one of the reasons

1249
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,800
they don't push that on you.

1250
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,120
Maybe a middle ground there could

1251
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:51,560
be a nice way to just add a checkbox for the Flatpak repo,

1252
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:57,500
because that is a third party community initiative.

1253
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,640
And I don't think Fedora wants to vouch

1254
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:02,440
for the quality or safety of the applications on there.

1255
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:06,480
But if they could come to a pretty easy way

1256
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,840
to get the NVIDIA graphics working,

1257
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,840
I think we could figure out a way to get FlatHub.

1258
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:12,300
Yeah, and I ran into the same issue with Quossel.

1259
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:13,800
Whenever I was downloading Quossel,

1260
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,640
I could get the full Quossel.

1261
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:18,640
But the FlatHub had the Quossel client, which

1262
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,160
is all I needed for that laptop.

1263
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,920
So there were a few things that were different that took some getting

1264
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:24,440
used to.

1265
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:29,720
But overall, it's been a great three or four days using it.

1266
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,960
I would think it would behoove them to make it easier

1267
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,640
to integrate FlatHub into GNOME software,

1268
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,240
simply because Ubuntu 19.10 ships with snaps integrated,

1269
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,240
and you get a much larger range of software.

1270
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,880
It's nice to have in there, yeah.

1271
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,280
And just like FlatHub has a lot of great apps.

1272
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,860
And it is now a little bit different,

1273
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:48,120
like depending on which distro you're using Flatpaks,

1274
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:52,080
or you're using the distro packages,

1275
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,960
there's a lot of little decisions you've got to make.

1276
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,920
Pluggy, pluggy again for that ChooseLytics.

1277
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:00,440
Of which, Drew, have you played with Toolbox?

1278
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:03,360
Because that's something that the Fedora project is really

1279
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:04,920
putting forward on this release.

1280
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,520
I have.

1281
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,800
I've played with Toolbox and Silverblue,

1282
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:12,920
which is where you really see Toolbox as part of the base

1283
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:13,960
operating system.

1284
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,720
You can get it on Workstation now,

1285
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:19,820
but it kind of grew out of their work with Podman,

1286
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:24,760
and wanting to make Podman easier to use in Silverblue.

1287
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,260
And it's a really cool project.

1288
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:31,960
Basically, it's a way to spin up an OCI container on the fly,

1289
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:37,480
or keep them around, and do work in that container off

1290
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:43,200
of essentially a base image that you can then

1291
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,560
drop in extra applications, or things

1292
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:49,000
that you maybe don't want to put in permanently

1293
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,720
into your own base system.

1294
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,440
Yeah, maybe you don't want to muck it up.

1295
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:55,120
And here's some of the neat things that it does,

1296
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:58,240
is it uses your existing username and permissions.

1297
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,960
So you're just, boom, you're up, and then

1298
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,160
it gives you a quick way to jump into that container's

1299
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,200
command line.

1300
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,440
You get access to your own home directory,

1301
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,240
and you get all your command line tools, including DNF.

1302
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,440
Containers have come so far.

1303
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,320
It's just amazing.

1304
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,040
Yeah, speaking of Silverblue, Silverblue

1305
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,520
doesn't have DNF in the base system.

1306
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:19,120
So if you want to look up packages using the command line,

1307
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,920
that's how you have to do it, is you

1308
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:24,240
have to drop into a toolbox, pull the package name,

1309
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,720
and then drop back out of the toolbox

1310
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:30,200
and install it via rpm-ostree.

1311
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:33,560
So you were our man on the scene over there in Silverblue town,

1312
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:36,280
but it sounds like after some initial success,

1313
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,200
you've wound up back on Workstation.

1314
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:38,720
I did.

1315
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,920
Yeah, I had some issues with it.

1316
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,200
I think I got a bad update at one point.

1317
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,360
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1318
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:45,900
I thought the whole point of Silverblue

1319
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:48,800
was to prevent anything going wrong with bad updates.

1320
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:49,560
What happened?

1321
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,880
Well, yeah, so I'm not exactly sure

1322
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:55,960
what happened to my system, but the idea

1323
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,600
is that you have an immutable base,

1324
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:02,800
and you can kind of shift up and shift down.

1325
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:07,840
Like, I went to Fedora 31 early, early beta,

1326
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:11,440
and I was able to roll back to Fedora 30

1327
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,920
just within my boot menu, but something happened.

1328
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,680
And anything that I tried to boot just

1329
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,240
resulted in a black screen.

1330
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,560
I couldn't switch to another TTY.

1331
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,920
I couldn't get anything done.

1332
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:27,400
And I had to get rolling, so I just

1333
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:32,060
paved it and went to the Workstation 31 beta.

1334
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:36,720
So I think it's still a little too experimental for me.

1335
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,080
Now, I haven't checked it out with Fedora 31 stable,

1336
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:44,320
but I have been keeping track of what they're

1337
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:47,120
looking forward to in 32.

1338
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:52,160
And I think that they're going to really start taking down

1339
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,440
these little bugs, and getting Podman and Toolbox

1340
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:01,320
where it needs to be, and have everything really tightened up.

1341
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,000
It's looking good for that.

1342
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,960
So I'm hoping all of the feature sets make it into 32,

1343
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,720
and in another six months, I might be giving it another go.

1344
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,920
I could see it.

1345
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,920
I could see how technologies like Toolbox

1346
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,920
will evolve over time.

1347
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,960
I'm going to, after this release,

1348
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,960
because they kind of made a big stink about it,

1349
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,420
I was like, well, I'll check it out.

1350
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:24,320
I'm going to keep using it, because it allows me to have

1351
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,320
not only a couple of different user environments I can muck up,

1352
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,240
but it's super easy to get started.

1353
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:32,960
And that kind of technology wasn't really even around

1354
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,360
when Silverblue started.

1355
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:37,040
I mean, the tech was, but the implementation of it

1356
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,640
wasn't around when Silverblue started.

1357
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,960
That's the hard stuff here, is making it actually useful

1358
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:41,580
to you.

1359
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:42,120
Right.

1360
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:45,240
And Flatpaks were nascent.

1361
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:49,640
And things like projects like FlatHub hadn't even begun yet.

1362
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:53,480
And some of the advantages that Gnome Shell has with you

1363
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,080
going over to Wayland are only now becoming realized.

1364
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:59,380
All of these things are sort of happening around Silverblue,

1365
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:02,560
which seems like it's going to make it a better

1366
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:05,180
candidate once they've all kind of crystallized a bit.

1367
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,960
So I could see how in six months to a year,

1368
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,480
it could be in a much better state.

1369
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,000
Yeah.

1370
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,960
And for me, part of the problem that I have with it

1371
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:16,920
is there is absolutely no I686, no multi-lib, none of it.

1372
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,920
Right, which is bad for audio.

1373
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:21,800
It is, because I use a lot of things through Wine

1374
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:27,080
to kind of help out in my workflow, and I can't do that.

1375
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:31,720
So my options are run all my audio in a VM

1376
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:35,760
or possibly try to pass things through the toolbox,

1377
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,160
but that gets a little messy.

1378
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:40,680
And yeah, it's just not the best now.

1379
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:44,280
I'm hoping that the future of Pipewire

1380
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:48,000
helps to make things a little better for me down the line.

1381
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,880
Or other projects that may be in the works.

1382
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,080
There's other ways to solve that particular problem, which

1383
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:57,360
Westpain's been taking a crack at.

1384
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:00,360
I still think things are looking pretty good for 32.

1385
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:02,920
Some of the story of 31, to be quite honest with you,

1386
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:06,600
is just about the performance improvements,

1387
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,800
which we talked about with Ubuntu 19.10, right?

1388
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:10,880
Yeah, indeed.

1389
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,280
So if Ubuntu 19.10 hadn't happened,

1390
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:17,480
the majority of this would be about the performance

1391
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,480
improvements to Gnome Shell.

1392
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,200
They're all there.

1393
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:20,880
They're great.

1394
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:21,400
It is great.

1395
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,800
I'm really enjoying it.

1396
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,120
So I guess it's worth an honorable mention.

1397
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:28,160
And it's really kind of nice to see it all materialize.

1398
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,480
So what do you say?

1399
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,400
Will you give it another try in a little while

1400
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,440
and report back to you?

1401
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,280
Yeah, absolutely.

1402
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,880
I think I'm going to give it some time,

1403
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:42,200
let them really get 31 up to speed and look forward to 32

1404
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,640
and see how they're doing for that release.

1405
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:45,280
Yeah.

1406
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,040
And in the meantime, Workstation will do the job, right?

1407
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:48,920
Absolutely, yeah.

1408
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:52,600
I've been really happy with 31 Workstation.

1409
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,320
And I haven't had any mouse lag issues,

1410
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:58,240
even though I'm using a very similar setup to what

1411
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:03,920
you have on your desktop with dual monitors and a Ryzen

1412
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:08,520
card and AMD CPU SSDs.

1413
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,720
But no mouse lag for me.

1414
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:14,560
I think it could even come down to what USB port or bus

1415
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,760
my mouse is on.

1416
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:16,880
There's so many variables.

1417
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,400
It's three monitors, to be clear.

1418
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,680
It's not two, but it's still kind of the same thing.

1419
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:26,640
And I wonder if it's not just some unique combination

1420
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:30,080
of hardware that will never be solved on my system.

1421
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,240
And the reason why I know it's unique to that box

1422
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,280
is because it works so brilliantly

1423
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:35,560
on all the other systems.

1424
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,180
Well, at least that means it's solvable.

1425
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:38,800
We just got to get you a new rig.

1426
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:39,480
Yeah, that's it.

1427
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:39,840
That's it.

1428
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:42,320
I just got to get a brand new computer, a really nice,

1429
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:43,640
fast computer.

1430
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:46,160
I did a brief rabbit hole deep dive

1431
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:49,640
into schedulers with this Fedora release,

1432
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:53,400
because they switched to the BFQ scheduler by default.

1433
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:56,960
And now I have learned that Linux applications can actually

1434
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,600
choose from a list of schedulers that the kernel can

1435
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,840
make available, which blows my mind

1436
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,480
that this is even a thing.

1437
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:06,920
But just as of note, Fedora 31 switches

1438
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:09,720
to BFQ, which has some people excited.

1439
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,600
So Alex, last but not least, I know

1440
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:14,800
that you've been giving the new fresh release a go

1441
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:15,880
as we've been recording.

1442
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:18,640
Do you have any takeaways before we wrap up on the new release?

1443
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:22,320
I have about three or four different LVFS firmware updates

1444
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:25,080
to do.

1445
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,400
Oh, yeah, by the way, that is one of the funny things

1446
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,800
when you install Fedora or something that does LVFS

1447
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,180
and you haven't run it before.

1448
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:32,360
You've been on a desktop environment that

1449
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,060
doesn't have it.

1450
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:36,640
It's like, oh, I've been neglecting this.

1451
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,760
Are you on a laptop?

1452
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,880
Yeah, it's my ThinkPad T4ATS.

1453
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:40,840
Oh, yeah, of course.

1454
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:43,600
Yeah, yep, I had the same three updates, I think.

1455
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,640
I just have a hard time with GNOME.

1456
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:48,400
This is my issue with Fedora at the moment.

1457
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,560
As a server OS, I use it every day

1458
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,200
for hacking around and stuff.

1459
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:57,000
But I don't know, I just, GNOME, ah, just can't.

1460
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,880
I know, it's so clean and smooth and gets out of your way.

1461
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:00,520
Simple.

1462
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,200
Until you have mouse lag, and then you

1463
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:04,200
want to burn it to the ground.

1464
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,760
I think I might go back to plasma

1465
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,360
for a little bit on that machine.

1466
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,480
I want one environment on all my machines

1467
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,720
so that way I can muscle memory it, you know?

1468
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:12,920
Just stop thinking about it.

1469
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:15,360
And then I want to be that individual that's

1470
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:18,280
got the same environment for a decade,

1471
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:22,320
and so they just are one with the UI of their computer.

1472
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:26,280
Because I know a guy who's been using XFCE, well, besides Joe.

1473
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:29,400
But Joe would probably also be this individual.

1474
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:34,120
He's been using XFCE on this old computer for a decade.

1475
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,640
Same computer, same interface.

1476
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:41,160
He just upgrades Debian every time that a release comes out.

1477
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:44,060
And he is like a wizard.

1478
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:48,840
I mean, he moves around, and I move pretty quick, Wes.

1479
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:49,760
Indeed you do.

1480
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,240
And this guy is like a wizard, I tell you what.

1481
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:56,560
And in part, it's because in his fingertips,

1482
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:59,160
he knows where the elements of the UI are.

1483
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,600
Have you considered switching to I3?

1484
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:01,100
Yeah.

1485
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:01,600
Yeah.

1486
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,100
Yeah.

1487
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,920
Yeah.

1488
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,640
All right, let's get out of this.

1489
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:08,960
Let's get out of this, and let's talk about our pick this week.

1490
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,280
I really like this pick.

1491
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,680
As Wes always says, it turns out if you try hard enough,

1492
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:14,280
you can.

1493
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:16,880
I wanted a great way to get remote terminal access.

1494
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,440
And so what I was doing for some of these benchmarks that

1495
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,020
ran for hours and hours, and I wanted to get out of here,

1496
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:24,360
is we'd started up in a Tmux session,

1497
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,720
and then you'd have to SSH into one.

1498
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,120
Well, first you set up WireGuard,

1499
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:29,720
and then you'd SSH into the server.

1500
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:31,840
And then from there, you could hop into the box,

1501
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,640
or maybe you could go directly from the box,

1502
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:35,480
depending on your WireGuard config.

1503
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,720
And then you'd join the Tmux session.

1504
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:39,360
And then it's fine.

1505
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:41,760
It's fine if you've got nothing to do.

1506
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,560
But it was a few steps.

1507
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,760
If you've got nothing to do, and all you want to do

1508
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:48,240
is play with your computer, it's fine.

1509
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,360
This isn't for you.

1510
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,320
But for those of us that want to get in,

1511
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,680
kick some terminal command, and get out,

1512
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,480
I introduce to you my friend's teammate,

1513
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,440
Instant Terminal Sharing.

1514
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:01,600
Like nothing we've talked about before, friends,

1515
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:04,520
and they both have a cloud version

1516
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:09,320
and a self-hosted version, teammate is a fork of Tmux,

1517
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:13,840
and they can exist on the same system together, no problemo.

1518
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:15,000
And it's a really easy way.

1519
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,440
You start a session in teammate, and it immediately

1520
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:22,300
generates an SSH address with a unique hash in it.

1521
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:24,120
Somebody pops that into their terminal,

1522
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:28,120
and bam, you're sharing a screen.

1523
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,800
Doesn't matter if you're behind NAT.

1524
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:34,880
It supports some actually pretty dodgy network conditions.

1525
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:38,120
And the tech behind it is super solid, all really well

1526
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:39,200
laid out on the website.

1527
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:45,000
And then when you self-host it, too, it's nice and secure.

1528
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,460
You don't have to worry about them proxying the connection

1529
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:48,120
or anything like that.

1530
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:48,800
Well, yeah, right.

1531
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:49,840
You set it all up.

1532
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:53,280
You can reuse existing SSH keys if you've got some set up

1533
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:54,900
or generate new ones, and it'll accept them

1534
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,120
as environmental variables.

1535
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:58,960
And of course, there's the Docker container out there

1536
01:00:58,960 --> 01:00:59,680
already.

1537
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:03,120
And teammate was in the Fedora repo, so that was easy to go.

1538
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:05,240
Yeah, it is really easy to get installed.

1539
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:09,400
And so this is a super solid way to start something up

1540
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,960
that you want to finish when you get somewhere else.

1541
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:13,800
And you're probably using Tmux anyway.

1542
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:16,180
Yeah, and if you're not, you really should look into it,

1543
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:19,080
because this is so, so handy when you know a job's going

1544
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:21,040
to be running for a while, but eventually

1545
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,600
the dumb, stupid computer's going to stop,

1546
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:26,000
and it's going to wait for the monkey to push a button,

1547
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
and it won't finish what it needs to do until the monkey

1548
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,020
pushes the button.

1549
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:31,120
And there's no reason you should stick around just

1550
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:34,760
to push the button when you can SSH to this unique address

1551
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:37,040
that it will generate, and you'll be on the box

1552
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,600
and on that session immediately.

1553
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:41,060
It also supports read-only mode if you just

1554
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:42,360
want to demonstrate.

1555
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:45,360
It has some of the feature sets of MOSH as well, which

1556
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:48,840
is a pick we've covered before, which helps restore connections

1557
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:51,600
when you move, or if you're on a mobile connection

1558
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:53,960
and your IP address changes.

1559
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:57,920
You can run it as a service, or you can just run it as a command.

1560
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:58,880
It's pretty cool.

1561
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,120
We set it up as a server-side service, too, so.

1562
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:03,440
Yeah, and that wasn't too bad to get going.

1563
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,320
You've got to go futz with it a little bit,

1564
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,680
but that's always how it goes.

1565
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:09,660
Or you can just, if you need something super quick,

1566
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:13,080
you can just install TeamMate, and by default, it

1567
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:14,800
will use their TeamMate.io server.

1568
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,340
Yeah, they've got a hosted server.

1569
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:19,320
I think it's actually already geo-load balanced out there.

1570
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,720
So there's probably one, hopefully,

1571
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:21,600
not too far from you.

1572
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:24,040
And all the code's free, open source.

1573
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,120
It's all available, and they have package.

1574
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:27,780
You can even get it installed on Mac OS.

1575
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:28,840
It's in brew.

1576
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,720
How about that?

1577
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,200
Yeah, and I think they even have a guide here

1578
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,180
on how to get it working on Windows.

1579
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:37,720
Wow, I tell you what, that's just pretty great.

1580
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,720
And of course, they've got packages for Ubuntu,

1581
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:42,040
and it's in the Ubuntu repo as well.

1582
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:44,440
So check it out, TeamMate.io, or we will

1583
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:46,160
have a link in the show notes.

1584
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,080
It's just one of those picks that we have just

1585
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:52,160
found so super helpful, like the magic wormhole, which

1586
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,000
is a really easy way to send files around.

1587
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,760
Not every pick actually sneaks into the tool belt,

1588
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:57,880
but this one, I think.

1589
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:58,440
Oh, yeah.

1590
01:02:58,440 --> 01:02:58,920
Oh, yeah.

1591
01:02:58,920 --> 01:02:59,920
I'm using it.

1592
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:01,920
I'm using it to get into machines in the RV, too,

1593
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,620
because what's great about it is those are behind a double mat,

1594
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:07,820
and I can still use that to get into those sessions.

1595
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:11,800
So I can kick my Shinobi box in the gear, that stupid Shinobi.

1596
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:17,400
Anyways, a link to the picks is at linuxunplug.com slash 325,

1597
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,520
where you'll also find our contact page,

1598
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:22,920
our subscribe page, references to everything

1599
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:25,240
we've covered today, all that kind of stuff.

1600
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:27,080
Anything else we need to cover, Mr. Payne, any other duties

1601
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:28,600
we need to perform before we get out of here?

1602
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,160
If you want to find out a little bit more about benchmarking,

1603
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:32,200
stay tuned.

1604
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:34,480
That's what Jim and I are talking about in this week's

1605
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,320
episode of TechSnap.

1606
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:35,840
Oh.

1607
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:36,560
Yeah, so dive in.

1608
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:39,240
We talk about FIO, some of his favorite ways of doing that,

1609
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:42,000
and what you need to know about IOPS and throughput.

1610
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,120
I love the way he explains stuff, so that is going to be great.

1611
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:46,720
And he knows that stuff, too.

1612
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:48,400
He really does, so that'll be good.

1613
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,200
Look for that later this week.

1614
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:53,080
TechSnap.systems for that.

1615
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:55,080
And go follow the network at Jupiter Signal.

1616
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:58,800
The show is at Linux Unplugged, I believe, on there.

1617
01:03:58,800 --> 01:03:59,320
Sounds right.

1618
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:00,000
Yeah.

1619
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,480
I'm at Chris L-A-S. Go check out Drew at Choose Linux.

1620
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,600
And of course, Alex and I over at Self Hosted.

1621
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,400
Selfhosted.show.

1622
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,280
It's good stuff.

1623
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,760
We'll see you back here next Tuesday.

1624
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:37,760
I'm Chris L-A-S.

1625
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:47,200
All right, let's go title the show, jbtitles.com.

1626
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,680
And then we're going to do a little internet helps,

1627
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,200
if you guys are ready, OK?

1628
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,200
What?

1629
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:53,880
We're going to do a little internet helps.

1630
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:55,800
Well, we need to help out the Linux Foundation.

1631
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,760
They're having some communications troubles.

1632
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:01,640
And I think we have just the crew to solve it, Cheesy.

1633
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:02,640
OK, let's do it.

1634
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:03,840
Yeah, yeah.

1635
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:06,760
So anyways, go over to jbtitles.com.

1636
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:10,560
I think something with fedora in there would be nice, or a hat

1637
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:13,440
full of hassles.

1638
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,520
That's kind of fun.

1639
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:18,120
I bet Matthew will be really excited to come on the show after

1640
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:18,920
that one.

1641
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:19,560
But I do love it.

1642
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:27,000
Purism Throttled, Of Mice and Zen, Where is Aspen?

1643
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,520
Yeah.

1644
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:29,360
Yeah, really.

1645
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:29,840
Yeah, really.

1646
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:30,520
All right.

1647
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:34,200
So jbtitles, jbtitles, now we all got to go vote.

1648
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,520
All right, so go over there now.

1649
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:36,480
It's voting time.

1650
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,760
All right, so let's do a little translation.

1651
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,920
And we're going to have to start at the headline,

1652
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:42,840
because even the headline's pretty thick.

1653
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:45,600
Brent, I'm going to ask you to define this first one, OK?

1654
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:46,560
So this one's on you.

1655
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:47,400
Prepare yourself, sir.

1656
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:48,400
All right, I'm ready.

1657
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,800
New Linux Foundation effort to focus on data confidence

1658
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:55,800
fabrics to scale digital transformation initiatives.

1659
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:56,840
What does that mean, Brent?

1660
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:59,560
It sounds like a new apparel line that they're coming up with.

1661
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:02,480
Here, I'll put a link in the show notes, too,

1662
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,360
so you can read the text yourself.

1663
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:07,000
New Linux Foundation effort to focus on data confidence

1664
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,640
fabrics to scale digital transformation initiatives.

1665
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:10,640
Here's how I read that.

1666
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:13,240
Oh my god.

1667
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:16,920
The Linux Foundation has a new initiative

1668
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:21,200
that wants to make people more confident in a whole layer

1669
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:22,520
of data products.

1670
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:23,800
Don't worry, though.

1671
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,120
They did mention AI.

1672
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,360
That's in the second paragraph.

1673
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,760
Yeah, OK, so here's the subheadline.

1674
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,680
Let's see, who should we pick on for this one?

1675
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:32,920
Who do you want to pick on?

1676
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,440
Should we pick on Alex?

1677
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:35,640
Let's pick on Alex for this one.

1678
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:36,360
Wait, did I win or lose?

1679
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:38,880
No, no, you didn't win.

1680
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:41,280
All right, Alex, this is the subheadline.

1681
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:44,040
I'd like you to translate this.

1682
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:46,120
We've only made it from the headline now.

1683
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:49,840
In partnership with leading industry players,

1684
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:53,000
Linux Foundation to create Project Avalarium

1685
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:57,200
to facilitate intrinsic trust in data and applications,

1686
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:00,000
spanning heterogeneous systems of systems.

1687
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,200
Blah, blah, blah.

1688
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,480
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1689
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:05,200
No, no, you've got to say what you really think it means.

1690
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,320
You've got to say what you really think it means.

1691
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:08,880
I think it was written by someone

1692
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:11,440
with a marketing degree that doesn't understand technology.

1693
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,520
No, they're trying to convey a message there.

1694
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,240
There is something they're trying to say.

1695
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:16,600
So all right, Alex, do you know?

1696
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:19,520
GZ, do you got any guesses on what they're trying to say?

1697
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,960
Leading industry players.

1698
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:22,840
Right.

1699
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:27,640
Avalarium facilitate intrinsic trust in data.

1700
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:31,080
So industry players are?

1701
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,520
Like Dell, IBM.

1702
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:33,040
Right, right.

1703
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:38,560
And they are trying to facilitate intrinsic trust

1704
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:43,040
with data from various different applications

1705
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:45,520
on various different systems.

1706
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,760
I think that's pretty close.

1707
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:47,880
I think that's pretty dense.

1708
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:49,000
Systems of systems.

1709
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,520
Yeah, system of systems.

1710
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:51,720
All right, well, I'm sure they'll explain it

1711
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:53,160
in the opening paragraph.

1712
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:56,120
It goes, the Linux Foundation, a nonprofit organization

1713
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:57,880
dedicated to accelerating the growth of Linux

1714
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:00,220
and collaborative development among sustainable open source

1715
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:02,880
ecosystems, which they are pretty good so far,

1716
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:06,240
today announced the intent to form the Project Avalarium.

1717
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:08,560
Project Avalarium will focus on building concepts

1718
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:11,080
of data confidence fabrics, DCFs,

1719
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:13,160
to facilitate measurable trust.

1720
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:14,320
OK, measurable trust, right.

1721
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:15,760
Now I'm starting to get lost here.

1722
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:19,360
Measurable trust means that somehow people

1723
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:23,240
will be able to gauge how trustworthy it is, right?

1724
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,360
So that's pretty easy.

1725
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:28,000
Measurable trust and confidence in data and applications

1726
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,960
spanning heterogeneous systems.

1727
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:32,520
So OK, so data in the applications

1728
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:34,360
across multiple types of systems.

1729
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:37,040
The product will be seeded by code from Dell Technologies

1730
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:40,360
with support from industry leaders, including ARM, IBM,

1731
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:40,960
and others.

1732
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:43,120
I like the second paragraph, though.

1733
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:46,040
A DCF, or trust fabric, is a framework

1734
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,920
comprised of a variety of technologies

1735
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:51,080
that help insert trust into the data path,

1736
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:54,360
in turn facilitating the orchestration of trusted AI

1737
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:56,720
models and the delivery of data from devices

1738
01:08:56,720 --> 01:09:01,080
to applications with measurable confidence.

1739
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:02,480
Oh.

1740
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:03,480
I'm going to need a nap.

1741
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:05,000
