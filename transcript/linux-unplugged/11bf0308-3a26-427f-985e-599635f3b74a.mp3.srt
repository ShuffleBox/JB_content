1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,360
Before we hit record, we were talking about Stadia,

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,220
and what a disappointment it has turned into.

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,300
And I already regret buying my,

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,100
I think they called it Founder's Bundle

5
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,100
or something like that.

6
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,340
Yeah, they got you suckered in.

7
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,020
I mean, I had fun playing it here at the studio,

8
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,860
but I haven't heard you mention it since then.

9
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,900
No, I pretty much stopped using it a couple of weeks

10
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,740
after I got it.

11
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,980
So I logged back in this morning,

12
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,340
and I now am the proud owner of one pay game.

13
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,300
I bought that early on, Red Dead Redemption,

14
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,700
for like $100.

15
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,900
But you gotta play something.

16
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,740
And then I got Metro Exodus now for free.

17
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,380
I don't know, where do they go wrong, guys?

18
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,580
Is it the price of the games?

19
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,460
Is it a lack of games?

20
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,620
Is it all of the above?

21
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,500
I think it's the fact that you don't get a refund

22
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,020
whenever they close the system down.

23
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,940
Ha ha ha ha, when they inevitably shut it down.

24
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,060
People are just too familiar with Google.

25
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,840
Google got the track record, so yeah.

26
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,420
I think it's a bit late as well.

27
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,620
I mean, I appreciate that the whole streaming services,

28
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,660
now is the time for streaming services.

29
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,980
Like, we've got Netflix, we've got Spotify.

30
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,880
We understand the whole streaming technology.

31
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,500
But everyone's already got their game system set up,

32
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,780
and they've got their Steam account,

33
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,060
and they've got their itch.io for indie games,

34
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,480
and all those other stores that nobody cares about.

35
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,900
I think it feels too late.

36
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,460
It feels like people already bought

37
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,180
into all the other platforms.

38
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,300
Yeah, there's that.

39
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,220
And but, to what Cheese was saying,

40
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,820
I just read an article where the journalist went around

41
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,860
and interviewed Stadia players, and he did not prompt them.

42
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,180
But almost all of them said they were concerned Google

43
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,620
would shut it down eventually.

44
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,100
That's become Google's brand.

45
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,820
And then, of course, you combine the fact

46
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,520
that you need a pretty decent connection.

47
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,940
When I want to play video games, I'm at home,

48
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,980
and I don't have a great connection at home.

49
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,360
I have a good connection at work,

50
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,420
but I'm not playing video games at work.

51
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,640
So you combine all these things, the game prices,

52
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,620
the fear of them shutting it down, internet connections.

53
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,060
It just doesn't seem like Google's going to pull it off.

54
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,540
We'll see if the next thing happens.

55
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,500
I mean, who knows?

56
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,200
Maybe they'll keep it going.

57
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,500
People are putting a lot of money into this.

58
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,960
They kind of have to stick with it.

59
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:16,100
Hello, friends.

60
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,100
Welcome into your weekly Linux talk show

61
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,900
that makes its own Super Tuesday.

62
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,580
My name is Chris.

63
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,340
My name is Wes.

64
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,460
Hello, Wes.

65
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,220
Nice to be podcasting with you for 3.43.

66
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,420
Yes, I'm casting my vote for Linux Unplugged.

67
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,560
We have a lot to cover this week.

68
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,940
We have a big one to get into, a little real talk

69
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,520
for the community this week, something

70
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,880
that has been brewing behind the scenes

71
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,300
in various different conversations for a while.

72
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:44,340
And it starts when I tried using a MacBook at home

73
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,340
for about a month.

74
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,340
What?

75
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,860
And I came away with a couple of interesting notes

76
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,060
that I want to share with the audience, observations,

77
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,300
and where I think the Mac gets it right, where they get it

78
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,380
wrong, and why, ultimately, Linux is the long game.

79
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,180
I still think that.

80
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:03,100
But in this endeavor, I had to give the Mac a real fair shake.

81
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,260
I challenged myself to try to treat this as intellectually

82
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,220
honest as I could.

83
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,420
At first, whenever I've used the Mac, I've always

84
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,420
kind of had this visceral kind of don't like using it.

85
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,420
It's just like all these rough edges response.

86
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,780
And it's a different paradigm.

87
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,500
Yeah, so this time I said to myself, all right, all right.

88
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,620
But what if you gave it a day like you give plasma?

89
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,900
You give plasma a whole day.

90
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,900
What if you gave this a whole day?

91
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,860
Would it be so bad then if you took a day?

92
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,400
So I'll tell you a little bit about that

93
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,020
and what I realized in that process.

94
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,180
But we have a bunch of community news

95
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,260
to get to as well as some pics.

96
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,820
But before we go any further, I've

97
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,980
got to say in the morning to Cheese, hello, Cheese.

98
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,940
Hey, guys.

99
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:38,740
How's it going?

100
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,180
Hey, buddy.

101
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,000
And then, of course, time appropriate greetings,

102
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,700
Mumble Room.

103
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,200
Hello.

104
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:42,700
Hello.

105
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,540
Good evening.

106
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,040
Howdy.

107
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,660
Hello.

108
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,260
Hi.

109
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,060
Hi.

110
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,420
Well, I hear a poppy in there.

111
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,340
Hello, poppy.

112
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,100
Well, hello there.

113
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:49,780
How are you?

114
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,380
Well, hello.

115
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,380
I'm good.

116
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,100
I'm quite well.

117
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,740
It's nice to see everybody in there.

118
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,060
A great turnout again.

119
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,580
I see Ace Nomad, Brent, and Byte, and Carl, and Colonel,

120
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,620
and Mini Mac, and Poppy.

121
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,580
And is it Stewn?

122
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,540
How do you say that?

123
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,460
Is it Stun?

124
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,300
Stewin?

125
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,660
Stewin, yeah.

126
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,700
That's about it.

127
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,780
Oh, welcome, Stewin.

128
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,860
I like that you're kind of iffy on that.

129
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,380
In Dutch, it's Stun.

130
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,380
Ah, OK.

131
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:13,860
All right.

132
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,380
OK.

133
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,780
I see what you're rolling with.

134
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,060
Well, let's talk about some things that are coming down.

135
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,340
The distribution pipeline, very soon.

136
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:24,100
If you're going to grab Ubuntu 20.04 when it comes out,

137
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,940
or one of the modern distros that ships Gnome Shell,

138
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,700
then you're likely going to end up with Gnome 3.36.

139
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,300
Right?

140
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,340
That's what comes in the focal.

141
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,660
Poppy's been getting me kind of tempted to actually start

142
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,920
running it as my daily driver.

143
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,260
You're not already?

144
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,900
I downloaded it last night.

145
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,900
So I might.

146
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,940
I just, I don't know.

147
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,420
I've been really happy with Manjaro.

148
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,660
But I think I want to wipe it and go with 20.04

149
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,740
just to use it for a bit before the release

150
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,620
and have some hands-on.

151
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,260
But there's some nice things landing in 3.36 of Gnome Shell.

152
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:58,300
A bunch of fixes, a bunch of performance improvements.

153
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,300
And these changes are landing just kind of in time

154
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,860
because it's going into code freeze.

155
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,260
It's going to be all done.

156
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,780
So whenever it does land, in whatever distribution you use,

157
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,500
there'll be some things to look out for.

158
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,420
There are improvements to the CSS engine.

159
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,300
But there's also a batch of cleanups

160
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,580
and refactoring to how it handles files

161
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,980
in general for the SCSS.

162
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,540
And Gnome Shell also now is avoiding certain I.O.

163
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:23,580
operations in the main thread, which saves on disk I.O.

164
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,100
And this is a cute one, but it's a nice fix.

165
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,160
The local time zone is now cached,

166
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,220
which will avoid reading the contents of Etsy local time

167
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,460
more than necessary.

168
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,620
But as a consequence of that, Gnome Shell

169
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,900
actually behaves a lot better under heavy I.O. loads.

170
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,860
Animations also are now disabled under various circumstances,

171
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,060
such as if Gnome Shell is using a software render,

172
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,620
or if you're sharing your screen with VNC,

173
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,260
it turns off the animations.

174
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,220
That's so smart.

175
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,420
It's nice, huh?

176
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,860
And also, it officially is now shipping that extensions

177
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,060
management app that we talked about once before that allows

178
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,140
you to globally disable extensions,

179
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,860
sort of takes that functionality out of Gnome Tweak

180
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,940
and puts it in an actual Gnome Shell official application

181
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,860
where users can look at their extension status,

182
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,980
toggle them on or off, and things like that.

183
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,300
Might be small, but it feels pretty big there.

184
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,700
Yeah, I will use the crap out of that.

185
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,060
Now, of course, Mudder hasn't been left out.

186
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,700
Lots of good improvements there,

187
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,260
including improved screencasting support.

188
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,060
And this part caught my eye.

189
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,020
The screencast engine is now implemented on top of PipeWire

190
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,100
and exports a PipeWire node that can be read and consumed

191
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,300
by other applications.

192
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,740
So now you've got that nice jack-like ability

193
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,180
in the PipeWire graph to go connect things up.

194
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,260
Intel now also, this API would download the contents

195
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,220
of the monitor frame buffers from the GPU

196
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,820
to the system memory, and then pass it to PipeWire.

197
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,060
After that, but that was obviously highly inefficient,

198
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,060
and that's been improved.

199
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:48,980
That's cool.

200
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,260
So that means doing screencast and stuff like that,

201
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,420
but less of a load on your GPU and on your CPU.

202
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,260
Exactly.

203
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,140
That's a great improvement.

204
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,860
And using PipeWire behind the scenes to do that.

205
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,980
And also, back in February, a major change came in

206
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,620
on how Mudder handles drawing monitors.

207
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,180
This is the first step towards achieving a goal

208
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,260
of one frame clock per monitor.

209
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,940
And that's a nice architectural change

210
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,780
that should eventually translate to real usability wins.

211
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,100
Yeah, a lot of rendering improvements in general,

212
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,180
cutting down on just unnecessary rendering

213
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,460
in different scenarios.

214
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,060
And even improvements in how the wallpaper is handled,

215
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,740
which allows Mudder to save resources

216
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,700
when scaling is applied to a monitor.

217
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,020
And then of course, various fixes

218
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,860
for Wayland support have landed.

219
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,780
Small memory leaks were plugged.

220
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,380
And Mudder now avoids flickering on X11

221
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,300
when you're using an, when windows are switching

222
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,780
between undirected or not.

223
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:42,780
GNOME 3.36, looking really, really good.

224
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,820
Plasma, looking really, really good.

225
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,580
Like things are getting in shape.

226
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,020
I can't help when we talk about GNOME

227
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,620
to think back a little bit to,

228
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,420
you know, when we express some of our concerns

229
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,940
about the underlying architecture

230
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,940
and just the amount of work it would take

231
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,900
to sort of get on really solid footing.

232
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,060
But I think we're past that.

233
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,940
I mean, the pace of development, the changes,

234
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,340
the improvements deep down in how Mudder works,

235
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,540
those are all coming in.

236
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,340
This to me seems like a clear long-term knock-on effect

237
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,140
of Canonical putting Ubuntu behind GNOME Shell.

238
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,980
And they've done a big portion of a lot of this work,

239
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,500
but even just that, it's inspired others

240
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,180
to pick up the work there.

241
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:27,820
It really has gotten to a much, much, much better place.

242
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,980
It's just about time to throw it all out

243
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,460
and start over, isn't it, Popey?

244
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,020
Oh, I don't know about that.

245
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,180
2004 is gonna be around for a long time.

246
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,260
So, you know, you can install 2004 in April

247
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,260
and be confident that you're gonna keep getting updates

248
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,260
for five, maybe 10 years.

249
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,300
Yeah, good answer.

250
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,700
Dang it, dang it.

251
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,620
Also, just bringing the slow, eventual,

252
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:52,140
no big deal, low-key arrival of Wayland's Firefox 75,

253
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,140
which is due to be released next month,

254
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,260
should have its native Wayland support

255
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,860
in really good order now.

256
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,100
Yeah, merged yesterday as we record this

257
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,780
with the Firefox Wayland patches

258
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:08,380
for VA API video acceleration support in conjunction

259
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,100
with FFmpeg.

260
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,700
Support does require enabling OpenGL

261
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,780
or web render within Firefox,

262
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:19,220
as well as setting the Wayland DMA buff VA API control knobs.

263
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,300
And if you don't know what that is,

264
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,140
I didn't really either,

265
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,500
but we'll have links in the show notes.

266
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,060
A control knob, huh?

267
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,580
I imagine that's just in the Firefox about config settings,

268
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,740
but I could be wrong.

269
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,780
I like it.

270
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,980
I like the terminology there for some reason.

271
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,340
I think it's kind of funny.

272
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,060
Cool to see it.

273
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,380
And like I say, it's sort of this,

274
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,140
just this low-key, slow arrival of Wayland.

275
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,380
Right. It would be no big deal.

276
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,220
More fundamentals.

277
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,460
And I think too, maybe what we'll talk a little bit more

278
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,180
with your experiences on the Mac,

279
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,660
it is these sorts of video acceleration niceties

280
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,460
that you just sort of expect on the modern desktop.

281
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,940
Yeah, fair enough.

282
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,660
You're, look at you teasing.

283
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,500
Well, before we get there,

284
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,020
how about a little housekeeping?

285
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,260
Don't forget about the daylight savings monster.

286
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,100
It arrives this Sunday here in the States.

287
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:01,940
Oh no, again?

288
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,060
I know.

289
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,860
Imagine the time math we do with working with folks

290
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,500
in both London, but also in Australia.

291
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,380
And then of course, all the time zones in the United States.

292
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,900
So, can we please just knock this crap off?

293
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,780
Right, UTC, let's be done with it.

294
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,100
I'm good.

295
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,260
I can do it. Let's go.

296
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,540
I'm fine with that, being on UTC,

297
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,020
given that's what we're on right now.

298
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:26,860
I know.

299
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,620
Even with that, making Popey and Joe happy, I'll tolerate.

300
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,060
Yeah, I mean, that's a compromise we all have to make.

301
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,020
Absolutely, it's worth it.

302
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,180
I wanna give a plug while we're talking about Joe.

303
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,500
Fosthawk Live, June 20th at the Harrison,

304
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,620
which as you know, is near King's Cross in London.

305
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,740
Of course.

306
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:47,340
I believe tickets are $1,000 each.

307
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,580
And your first, what's that?

308
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,700
No, that's not true.

309
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,100
Oh, okay, all right.

310
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,780
Well, you can get the details at fosthawk.com.

311
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,260
We'll have a link in the show notes.

312
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,940
Tickets are free.

313
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,860
Donations are welcome though.

314
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,140
So maybe put like $1,000 in that donation box.

315
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,140
That's probably one of those events

316
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,060
I would just love to make it to.

317
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:05,900
I know.

318
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,740
Someday.

319
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,860
Oh my God, it's so good.

320
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,700
It's so good.

321
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,980
It's so cozy.

322
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,420
You're in the basement of a pub, a proper pub,

323
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,740
and it's really dark and dingy down there.

324
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,940
And you've got uncomfortable small chairs

325
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,540
and that's what makes it awesome

326
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:26,020
because you're all a bunch of nerds, super cozy.

327
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,700
Joe pointed out the other day

328
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,220
that most of the people who bought a ticket,

329
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,620
or I say buy, have obtained a ticket,

330
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,020
have bought one ticket.

331
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,740
So most people go on their own

332
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,340
and people do worry about whether they're gonna fit in

333
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,340
and whether they're gonna have people to talk to.

334
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,220
Everyone will fit in.

335
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,580
Everyone will have someone to talk to.

336
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,620
It's a fantastic event.

337
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,900
I highly recommend people go if they can.

338
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:51,780
And there's social lubrication to go all around.

339
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,620
I would love to go.

340
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,780
I was gonna totally go,

341
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,980
but then Wes wouldn't let me go

342
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,500
because of the whole COVID-19 thing.

343
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,220
Just worry about you in the show.

344
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,020
Well, all right, so that's plenty.

345
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,060
We've probably gone a little too long there.

346
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,020
So more links.

347
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,460
There's additional things in the show notes,

348
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:10,300
but I wanna talk about Linux being a general purpose OS

349
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,100
for very specific things.

350
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,020
Think about that statement for a second.

351
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,140
A general purpose OS

352
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,380
that can be used for very specific things.

353
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,900
And while we're talking again about Joe,

354
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,140
go check out episode 84,

355
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:28,660
where they covered this in a slightly different track.

356
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,460
This has been a wider conversation

357
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:34,700
that we've been having privately amongst ourselves

358
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,820
and with friends and other people.

359
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,740
And they really kind of encapsulated the conversation

360
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,580
really good in episode 84 of Late Night Linux.

361
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,780
And really the idea there was,

362
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,220
is it time to focus on open source applications

363
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,740
and not so much on the desktop?

364
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,460
I don't buy that argument.

365
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:55,140
I think the desktop has a very bright future.

366
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,900
And in fact, I think Linux is better positioned

367
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,500
for that long-term for certain use cases

368
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,020
than any other platform.

369
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,380
And I think we'll get there.

370
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,940
But with that statement also, there's a flip side to it.

371
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:12,900
And that is, there are legitimately use cases

372
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,660
that it is not well-suited for.

373
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,620
We gotta be honest about that.

374
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,100
Based on just market dynamics and realities

375
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,660
and the way economics work,

376
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,260
the way it all just has shaken out, it's just the truth.

377
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,100
It's just-

378
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,860
And the expectations of regular users.

379
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,060
Yeah.

380
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:33,060
When I look at Linux, I look at it as a platform really

381
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,900
that is used on servers,

382
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,820
but also is almost a runtime these days

383
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,900
with WSL on Windows

384
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:46,020
and really kind of a universal kind of,

385
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,820
just everybody's writing applications

386
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,260
to run it on Linux in these containers.

387
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,180
And if they do that, it'll run on any platform.

388
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,300
You can run Docker containers on Windows 10

389
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,100
through WSL2 now.

390
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,940
This is something that,

391
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:59,020
and they've got Docker desktop that they're working on,

392
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:02,260
including, I watched a YouTube video this morning

393
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:07,260
of a YouTuber who is using XFCE from inside WSL2.

394
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,820
That's fantastic.

395
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,820
It's pretty crazy.

396
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,940
Of course, Docker's available for the Mac.

397
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:17,900
You can run Docker on a free NAS server, which is BSD.

398
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,460
So there's the runtime Linux, there's the server Linux,

399
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:25,860
there's the embedded OS Linux, there's desktop Linux.

400
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,180
Now, open source has clearly been successful.

401
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,620
There's a lot of really massive applications out there

402
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,740
like VLC and Firefox and Blender

403
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:39,260
and lots of desktop applications that are very successful.

404
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,580
But there's not many distributions of Linux

405
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,700
or desktop environments that are as successful

406
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,380
as some of those applications are.

407
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:51,380
And I think as time goes on, this will shift.

408
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,780
But today in 2020, there's still a very valid case

409
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,060
for a specialist OS.

410
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:00,220
Remember, I said Linux is a generalist OS

411
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,860
that can be used for specific purposes,

412
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,940
like embedded devices is always a go-to.

413
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,820
But then you have specialist OS

414
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,860
that are made by commercial vendors

415
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,260
that really serve one master purpose.

416
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,660
And this is the train of thinking I started to get down

417
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,860
when I started using this MacBook at home.

418
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,700
I had this 2017 TouchBar MacBook,

419
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,260
and it's not getting used for anything.

420
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,540
Ultimately, I just enjoy technology, whatever it might be.

421
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,900
That's a nice piece of hardware.

422
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,460
And so I thought, all right, well, let's try.

423
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,660
Let's try, I was kind of inspired

424
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,540
by something Alex and I have been talking about.

425
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,860
Let's try when I go home

426
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,340
using a totally different computing paradigm

427
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:46,260
to get a broader sense of at work and at home,

428
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,340
because then I could have all of my work stuff

429
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,940
on the ThinkPad, and when I'm at work, I'm on the ThinkPad,

430
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,420
and when I'm at home, I'm on the MacBook.

431
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,340
It's a totally just like jarring different-

432
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,980
Very clear indication of your switch.

433
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,220
Immediately hated it,

434
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,460
as every time I sit down to use Mac OS,

435
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,300
I just can't stand it.

436
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,620
It's a pretty fun environment at this point.

437
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,100
It's like a hundred small little things.

438
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,260
Like the trackpad's great,

439
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,740
but natural scrolling is turned on by default.

440
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,700
Like there's just, everything has a little bit

441
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:16,100
of a rough edge for me that I have to go finesse.

442
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,060
And I always would get sort of frustrated

443
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,060
and be like, I'm not doing this.

444
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,980
This is a $2,000 computer.

445
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,860
I shouldn't have to bother with this, right?

446
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,100
But yet I have no problem setting up a brand new laptop

447
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,220
or a Dell XPS or a custom-built PC

448
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,740
with plasma or GNOME Shell

449
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,540
and spending a day or two tinkering

450
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,020
to get it to just the way I want.

451
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,380
And I can cut that down, especially on GNOME Shell,

452
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,620
but like with plasma,

453
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,900
it usually takes me a couple of days

454
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,900
because I kind of fix it as I go along.

455
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,900
Right, you realize, oh yeah,

456
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,900
I do wanna tweak this setting.

457
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,380
So I said, okay, well, if I'm gonna be honest here,

458
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,420
I have to afford the same allowance for the Mac.

459
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,860
I can't judge it because I don't judge plasma

460
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,220
without modifying those things.

461
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,060
I don't judge GNOME Shell.

462
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,220
So I need to give the same allowances for the Mac.

463
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,740
And you gotta reach that everyday use steady state

464
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,620
that is really what it would be like to use it.

465
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,660
I will make just a side note.

466
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,460
The keyboard is atrocious.

467
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,620
It's really bad.

468
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,420
This is one of the butterfly?

469
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,340
Yeah, it's really, really bad.

470
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,540
And that's one of the reasons I quit using it.

471
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,460
Plus we just didn't really have,

472
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,100
we didn't need a Mac in production anymore.

473
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,260
So it's like when the company sale came,

474
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,500
I was like, ah, we don't use this.

475
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,820
I'll just keep this.

476
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,420
We don't use it for anything with production stuff.

477
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,300
Like I had to make a hard decision there.

478
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,740
And so it just sat being unused with the battery dying.

479
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,900
And that like just kills me.

480
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,980
Just sit there looking at it, you know,

481
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:32,820
and I feel guilty.

482
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,660
Money slowly wasting away.

483
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,140
So every now and then I plug it in with a USB-C cord

484
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:36,980
and then like unplug it.

485
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,900
And then like a month later, plug it back.

486
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,860
Like I just, I was neglecting it.

487
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:44,580
And so I thought, okay, well, I'll set up a $50 budget

488
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,460
because on the Mac, you gotta pay for everything.

489
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,460
Everything costs money.

490
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,380
You want window snapping, it costs money.

491
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,740
You wanna fancy something up, it costs money.

492
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,860
You want system meters in your menu bar, it costs money.

493
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,900
You wanna manage what icons are in your menu bar,

494
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,860
it costs money.

495
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,100
So I set up myself a $50 budget

496
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,020
and I have not spent all $50.

497
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,420
And within a day or two,

498
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:09,220
I think I had it as usable as I would probably say,

499
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,060
Gnome Shell.

500
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,100
That's really interesting too,

501
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,460
because I think at least on, you know,

502
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,700
when I'm used to the Linux desktop,

503
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,100
that seems like a really big philosophical period

504
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,460
that just that I couldn't expect those features

505
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,700
without having to pay for it.

506
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,500
But when you frame it with a very reasonable,

507
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,940
I mean, $50, especially if you're gonna invest in tools,

508
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,620
maybe one time or yearly, that's so reasonable.

509
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,340
It feels dumb to pay for something

510
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,380
to help me tile a window or snap a window.

511
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,420
But if I just say, all right,

512
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,500
I'm not gonna spend more than 50 bucks.

513
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,020
It was, they are good apps.

514
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,540
They are probably the best apps at doing that.

515
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,500
Like the one that is really fricking impressive

516
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,460
that I got is called iStat Menus.

517
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,620
This is one of the more expensive ones.

518
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,460
And some of these now want subscriptions, which is cute,

519
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,300
which is really cute, but it's menus,

520
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,060
it's menu meters up in the menu bar.

521
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,580
And it is, I mean, it's really good.

522
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,780
Like it's worth 30 bucks or it was 19 bucks.

523
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,340
It was worth it.

524
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,620
Really, I would buy it again.

525
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,500
I would buy it for Linux in a heartbeat.

526
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,460
And you have some insurance that, you know,

527
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,580
that's money going to the developer

528
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,780
to continue to develop it.

529
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:11,260
And of course on the Mac, you have the one platform.

530
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,900
So you're never gonna switch away

531
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,180
from the Mac OS environment

532
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,100
and not be able to use this anymore.

533
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,300
Just gonna keep working.

534
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,140
That is true.

535
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,220
Yeah, because if I'd bought something

536
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,620
that only worked with GNOME Shell,

537
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,460
wouldn't necessarily-

538
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,460
Maybe they have a Plasma, but maybe not.

539
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,980
Hmm, yeah, I hadn't thought of that.

540
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,780
I generally don't need to do it on those desktops.

541
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,780
Like Plasma has everything built in I need.

542
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,420
I just have to turn it on and learn how to configure it.

543
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,620
So once I got past this hurdle though,

544
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,780
I could appreciate a few things

545
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:40,380
that I think the Mac gets right.

546
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,980
In part, I started to notice things

547
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,260
that Linux can't really do,

548
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,340
that they can do on the Mac.

549
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,460
And that is they build Mac OS

550
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,020
with the intention of their pro apps being used

551
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,980
on the platform, like Logic and Final Cut.

552
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,140
What that means is the systems work together

553
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,460
in unique moments of stress,

554
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,140
probably in a way Linux never can.

555
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,460
Like the kernel team is working

556
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,500
with the audio subsystem team,

557
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,780
who's working with the video subsystem team

558
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,380
to make sure that things remain responsive

559
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,140
when the system's under serious pressure.

560
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:18,740
And really what got me started on this whole journey

561
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,140
was I wanted to see what would happen

562
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,140
if I hooked up my eGPU to the MacBook.

563
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,820
Like what does Mac OS catalyze do?

564
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,540
I mean, you've been pretty into eGPU,

565
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,380
so that makes sense.

566
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,060
And my first experiences with this

567
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,860
were documented in the Chris Lastcast,

568
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,700
where it was called like the Max Vista moment,

569
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,460
because Catalina is a rough turd.

570
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,260
Let me tell you, it is a rough rider,

571
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:43,620
and it is UAC all up in your face constantly.

572
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,100
It's worse than Vista.

573
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,300
And so you gotta get past that.

574
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,900
That takes like a solid two weeks

575
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,820
to get through all those damn dialogue boxes.

576
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:56,580
And once you do that, you hook up the eGPU,

577
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,660
it was remarkable.

578
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,220
So I would work on a project in Final Cut,

579
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,820
and the entire system would become aware

580
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,620
of the presence of an eGPU,

581
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:08,980
and applications could elect to use that eGPU,

582
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,380
or I could go in and tell them to prefer it even.

583
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,380
And what would happen is I could render something,

584
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,580
and Final Cut would dispatch work to the eGPU,

585
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:19,780
it would dispatch work to the AMD GPU

586
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,620
that's built into the laptop,

587
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,300
and it would dispatch work to the Intel CPU.

588
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,140
Wow.

589
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,780
You would manage all of that in the background,

590
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,220
effectively utilizing all of those cores.

591
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:35,220
And on this 2017 MacBook, I am crushing out video

592
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,220
that you wouldn't think should be possible on this thing.

593
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,620
And then the thermal throttling kicks in,

594
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,460
and then it slows down a little bit,

595
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,060
because it's a Mac after all.

596
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,420
But fundamentally, they have something wrong.

597
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,460
There's a sickness in this platform

598
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,260
that is not competitive with Linux,

599
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,180
but it doesn't mean it is not competitive.

600
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,620
What is hard for us to understand and appreciate

601
00:21:55,620 --> 00:22:00,220
is Apple's style here has been really easy

602
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,020
for third-party manufacturers, hardware makers,

603
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,540
people that are making interfaces,

604
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:08,660
people that are high-end audio interfaces like Apollo

605
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,820
that are several thousands of dollars

606
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,700
and only work with Macs,

607
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:16,140
or audio or video editing surfaces that work with the Mac,

608
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,420
or software that comes out on Mac OS.

609
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:22,180
There is a limited scope of problems

610
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,020
that they have to solve.

611
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,380
There's a known set of hardware,

612
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,940
and there's a known set of OSes.

613
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,900
And Apple only supports a few OS releases at a time,

614
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,860
so it's a very narrow spectrum you have to support.

615
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,460
And the flip side of that support

616
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,820
means you can optimize better for what you are supporting.

617
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,220
And if you're writing something for a pro user,

618
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,260
you can almost guarantee they're on the latest OS.

619
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,740
In fact, if you buy a Mac Pro today,

620
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,380
you can only run Catalina.

621
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,420
You can't run an older version of Mac OS.

622
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,820
So you can guarantee that your customer

623
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,660
is on a certain set of hardware and software,

624
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,180
and that that software gets revved every year

625
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,380
on a yearly cadence,

626
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,660
which is a built-in reason to then prompt your users

627
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,780
to buy the next version,

628
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,580
which adds support for the new OS,

629
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,700
so you have a guaranteed revenue bump every year.

630
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,700
So there's a real healthy third-party ecosystem

631
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,540
around them.

632
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,380
That's a whole lifecycle you can just sort of

633
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,200
latch right onto.

634
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,580
Hardware and software.

635
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:12,580
Well, I'm not so sure you can be that confident

636
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,620
that people are on Catalina

637
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,460
or whatever the latest Mac OS is,

638
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:19,900
because the second-hand market for Macs is so strong

639
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,420
that people will buy older Macs.

640
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,900
There's a whole series of YouTube channels

641
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,240
of people reviving old Macs and keeping them running

642
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,680
with whatever the latest version of Mac OS is

643
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,520
that they'll run.

644
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,540
And for some of them, it's older than Catalina.

645
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,900
And people have these Macs kicking around.

646
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,980
Like, I've got a MacBook Air kicking around here,

647
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,540
and that's not running Catalina.

648
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,540
So I don't think you can be super confident.

649
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,940
Like, sure, if you're following the gravy train

650
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:48,860
of people who are always buying and revving

651
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,500
to the next device every year,

652
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,820
if they're doing that annual update.

653
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,540
But I think your average Joe buys a Mac and keeps it

654
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:59,000
until they run it into the ground and then buy another one.

655
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,840
I agree.

656
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,620
You're an average Mac user, absolutely.

657
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:05,360
But where Apple gets you is certain hardware

658
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,300
requires Catalina, and certain software like Final Cut

659
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,020
to have eGPU support also requires Catalina.

660
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,780
So if you're a certain class, or Xcode, for example,

661
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:18,320
if you're an Xcode developer and you want live Swift previews

662
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,420
when you're writing an iOS app, you have to be on Catalina.

663
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,420
That's true.

664
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,940
And I also, while I'm here, I wanna mention,

665
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,020
I think it's interesting you set aside a budget

666
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,460
of like 50 bucks to get yourself

667
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,300
what you might call a working desktop.

668
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,300
Right.

669
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:38,980
And I think it's interesting because that's the kind of model

670
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,420
that I think the elementary guys are going for,

671
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:44,740
which is, you know, give you your basic desktop

672
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:47,560
that has nice features, it's beautiful,

673
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,180
but expect you to pay for the little applications

674
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,460
that you need here and there.

675
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,900
Now, their model is slightly different.

676
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,020
It's not 30 bucks per application.

677
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,600
It's pay what you want.

678
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,660
But they're certainly striving to ensure

679
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,540
that developers are being paid

680
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,860
for the software that they develop.

681
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,940
And I don't think that's unreasonable.

682
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,000
I think it's a good thing that on Linux,

683
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,860
we're starting to see more of that prevalence

684
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:14,300
of people being paid for work they do,

685
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,300
which is really super common on the Mac.

686
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,820
And it's just second nature on the Mac.

687
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,780
You need a thing, you pay for it, right?

688
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,380
But on Linux, there's that resistance.

689
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,700
And I think it's slowly coming.

690
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:30,700
I think with elementary improving their software store story

691
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:34,620
and Flatpak improving their software store story,

692
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,620
I think it will only improve on Linux as well.

693
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,140
People will up the game.

694
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:39,980
I agree.

695
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:42,540
In fact, that's a bit where I was gonna go with this is,

696
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,660
what's great about Linux is you can have these standups

697
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,700
where something is tried like exactly that,

698
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,900
like what elementary OS is doing,

699
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,940
which you don't get with the Mac platform.

700
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,940
But I thought I should give at least a fair crack

701
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,620
at what you do get with the Mac platform.

702
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,900
And I think it's that third party ecosystem,

703
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,700
hardware, software, that they've really nailed.

704
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,720
And it's a real tight experience.

705
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,220
Right, I mean, we've talked about some of the advantages

706
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,340
of the SDK supports that are out there.

707
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,700
That's a very consistent platform and internal services

708
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,760
that are all unified.

709
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,220
Yeah, but you remember at the start of this,

710
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,420
I said Mac OS is a specialist OS

711
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,420
and Linux is a general platform that can be-

712
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,060
Yeah. Built into something.

713
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:19,180
I think it's easier to go from a general platform

714
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,040
into a specific thing than from a specialist platform

715
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,020
into a general thing.

716
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:26,280
And what Mac OS specializes in,

717
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,780
and I think you need to be really clear about this,

718
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,980
is it fundamentally lives and dies by Apple's interests.

719
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:35,540
When they're focused on other things like the iPhone

720
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,520
or maybe AR glasses one day,

721
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,540
the hardware and the software at the same time

722
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,340
suffer substantially.

723
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,620
You can still see the knock-on effect of this

724
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,260
evident on the platform today.

725
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:52,620
This 2017 MacBook Pro is a living example

726
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,820
of when they took their eye off the ball for a while.

727
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:59,100
And that I think betrays the biggest weakness long-term

728
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,160
of the platform is it will always live and die

729
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,500
by Apple's interests.

730
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:07,380
What it specializes in is being a strategic product

731
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,820
for Apple, which has complimentary benefits

732
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:14,260
for third party ecosystems because of the dynamics of that.

733
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,420
But it doesn't mean it shall always remain that way.

734
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:21,160
In fact, the transition to ARM could be a great opportunity

735
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,020
to lock things down even further.

736
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:26,200
Maybe every app now has to be signed by Apple.

737
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,120
Maybe that's enforced at a hardware level in the Macs.

738
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,020
So now Hackintoshes aren't as viable.

739
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,500
And just somebody writing software, building it,

740
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:37,460
and running it on a Mac becomes no longer tenable.

741
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,380
That's possible as long as Apple's customers don't mind.

742
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,060
They have to walk a line there,

743
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,900
but you can guarantee they're gonna walk the side

744
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,900
of the line that we're not gonna like very much.

745
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:52,020
It's a very quantifiable, predictable ecosystem,

746
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,940
and it has a premium customer base,

747
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,980
but it will always suffer that fundamental flaw.

748
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,700
Its master is not the owner.

749
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,380
Its master will always be Apple

750
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:06,100
because their whole platform affects your Mac.

751
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,500
So whatever their long-term version of the market is

752
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,960
will affect your Mac.

753
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,700
Over time, the ecosystem will get locked down,

754
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,900
and general operating systems like Linux

755
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,180
that have been built up into specialists

756
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,100
like elementary OS or Ubuntu

757
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,140
will really be our last refuge.

758
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,380
They really will, and so that's why,

759
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,420
even if we can never quite nail integrating

760
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,980
with all the eGPU manufacturers

761
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,660
or the people that are making cool editing hardware,

762
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,920
even if we can never really nail that,

763
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:40,100
the Linux desktop is going to be more important than ever

764
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,140
as these platforms continue to evolve,

765
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:46,140
but it might only appeal to certain types of users.

766
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,540
Different distros will appeal to different types,

767
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:52,820
but I think when we're thinking about the future of Linux

768
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,700
and trying to advocate for the platform

769
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,340
or trying to market for the platform

770
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,500
or trying to make it the best platform for gamers,

771
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,260
we need to be realistic about what it can accomplish

772
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,820
and what it can do really well,

773
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
and I think you just look at the success

774
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,580
of things like open-source software,

775
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:10,180
like VLC and Blender and Firefox, et cetera, et cetera,

776
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:13,540
et cetera, or Docker, to prove how successful free

777
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,780
and open-source software can be,

778
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:20,140
and then ask why Linux is still continuing to shrink

779
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:22,480
in a lot of areas of the market on the desktop.

780
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,860
Like the Steam stats, I know everybody hates these,

781
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:28,900
but they just came out again, and we're down again.

782
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,200
Meanwhile, the Mac's up.

783
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:39,200
The Mac went from 0.14% to 3.15% in February.

784
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,340
Is that possible?

785
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,780
And Windows dropped slightly to 96%.

786
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,360
Linux is hanging in at 0.83%.

787
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,980
It was at 0.9 in January.

788
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:53,020
It's gone down, but what's even more frustrating

789
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:56,060
is it's been years now.

790
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,940
Protons have been around for a year and a half.

791
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,020
Like it's been a while,

792
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,740
and we're still struggling to even crack

793
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,100
these basic numbers that computers that barely ship

794
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,440
with functional GPUs can kick our butts on.

795
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,660
Like we just have to be honest.

796
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,540
There's just certain use cases we're not the strongest at.

797
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,620
There's others we dominate, we're awesome at.

798
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,460
And I mean, I think they touched on this very well

799
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,940
in late night Linux.

800
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,860
Computing moves on, right?

801
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,460
We add new paradigms, and most people just don't care

802
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,740
that much about the desktop.

803
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,100
I mean, if you do, then Linux is there,

804
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,860
and it's a great option that you can specialize

805
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:27,020
and tweak and make your own.

806
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,600
But for the most part, since you can get

807
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,580
all these open source apps on pretty much every platform,

808
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,160
or you're using web-based apps anyway,

809
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,620
why switch what you have now at works?

810
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,580
And I mean, most normal users don't care that much

811
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,420
about the specifics of the tool that they have to use.

812
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,820
Yesterday, you and I were kind of making

813
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:47,140
a really bad comparison to like a Tesla,

814
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,420
which you could say like maybe the Mac is a Tesla.

815
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:54,340
It's got self-driving, it's very, very expensive.

816
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,020
Any maintenance you do on it, or like, you know,

817
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,860
wheel replacement, anything.

818
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,780
Gotta go back to that specific vendor.

819
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:02,780
Very expensive, versus a, what would be like,

820
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,780
what would Linux be, a Jeep?

821
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,740
What would it be, a truck?

822
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:07,020
It's a versatile vehicle that you've kind of

823
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,740
built up yourself over time.

824
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,140
You have easy access to the engine,

825
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,140
you can swap things out, no problem.

826
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,660
But if you want things like self-driving,

827
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,500
well, there's maybe not a standard solution for that,

828
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,880
and you're gonna have to assemble it yourself.

829
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,260
Right, exactly.

830
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:23,400
And there's different products for different types of people,

831
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,060
or some jobs require something that you can customize,

832
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,340
or some people prefer to work in an environment

833
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,900
that's more tailored to them.

834
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:33,240
The Mac users are happy to set aside a budget of 50 bucks

835
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,460
to solve their problems.

836
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:37,080
The Linux users are like, well, that's just built in.

837
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,860
Or if it's not built in, it's an extension away.

838
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:42,180
I wanna chime in here a little bit on the Mac conversation

839
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,420
and the Steam survey conversation.

840
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:48,540
First off, I've never used a Mac to play Steam games on,

841
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,940
but I have used Linux and Windows.

842
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:55,940
I have a 2015 MacBook Pro that actually runs

843
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:00,980
elementary Pop OS Ubuntu pretty good.

844
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,620
So you don't have to,

845
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,400
I think they still make decent hardware.

846
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,960
I think you could debate that with their latest

847
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:11,100
butterfly keyboard and touch bar and all that.

848
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,880
But that 2015 that I have is still a great little machine,

849
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,440
and it runs Linux great.

850
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:21,260
And me personally, for my workflow, which is daily on a Mac,

851
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,860
I haven't spent any money on the store

852
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,780
to get any of these little personalization apps.

853
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:30,300
I literally have the Adobe Creative Suite,

854
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,340
Mumble, what we're recording on now,

855
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,460
Audacity, Quossel, and VS Code.

856
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,900
I wanted to have it like my workstation,

857
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,700
like where I have menu meters,

858
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,620
and it's something where if I was gonna live here,

859
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,140
how would I really wanna customize it?

860
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,940
Like I can customize an OS that I prefer to use.

861
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,180
That was my philosophy there.

862
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,500
And it's clear that it's doable,

863
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,700
but my home for that kind of mindset is better on Linux.

864
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,580
And I kind of like the idea of embracing Linux

865
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:01,180
as a professional power workstation.

866
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,660
That's why I find where Gnome Shell's going

867
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,020
and what it's fixing.

868
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:05,940
In the back of my mind,

869
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,300
when I read that news story we did today,

870
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,060
I hear this is going to make it

871
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,460
a more professional grade workstation.

872
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,820
Something that's faster, cleaner, leaner,

873
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,320
better put together.

874
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,940
And I'm surprised, but kind of pleased to see

875
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:24,200
that I think System76 is on a similar line of thinking.

876
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,780
We sat down with two individuals, Maria and Michael.

877
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,220
Maria is a UX architect,

878
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,940
and Michael is the product engineer

879
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,620
and one of the maintainers of Pop! OS.

880
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,660
And I think they're seeing some demand from power users

881
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,940
to add features to the Pop! OS experience,

882
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:43,140
and they're starting with tiling in their 2004 release.

883
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,580
So both Maria and Michael from System76

884
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,420
are joining us today to tell us a little bit

885
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:50,780
about the advances they're making in Pop! Shell.

886
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,740
Michael, could you describe it to us?

887
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:55,620
Pop! Shell is advanced tiling window management

888
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:58,260
for the Gnome desktop in Pop! OS.

889
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,200
That is a nice, concise elevator pitch.

890
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:04,220
So we're bringing with 2004 version of Pop! OS,

891
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,380
it's tiling inside of Gnome Shell.

892
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,880
It's not replacing Gnome Shell?

893
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,780
Yes, inside as an extension.

894
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,880
This is going to be something that will really appeal,

895
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,380
I think, to power users.

896
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,460
I'm kind of curious about that,

897
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,060
because normally when I think tiling,

898
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,580
I do think sort of advanced users,

899
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:20,820
maybe people who are using a more niche distro than Pop! OS

900
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,580
or who really like customizing their desktop,

901
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,660
but this seems, I played with it a little bit,

902
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,980
this seems way more accessible, and I'm curious,

903
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,540
what are the motivations for adding these

904
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,100
quote unquote advanced features

905
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,300
to an otherwise very friendly shell?

906
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,300
Everyone at System, or at least most people at System76

907
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,100
are using tiling window management,

908
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,900
and many of the members in our community

909
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,480
have also been using i3.

910
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,300
So it's popular inside the team, huh?

911
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,140
Yes.

912
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:52,140
Maria, I thought Pop! OS was, this is my bias,

913
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,740
but I thought it was a distro for new customers

914
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,780
that were buying their first Linux laptop.

915
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:00,180
I don't think we necessarily defined it that way,

916
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:04,360
but there is certainly a large subset of our users

917
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,980
who are very new to Linux.

918
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,060
Apparently Pop! OS is also, we found out,

919
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:12,700
very popular among those newcomers, if I can say so.

920
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,140
So part of the motivation, I think,

921
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:18,100
behind trying to make tiling more accessible

922
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:22,360
and create maybe a better, more easily approachable system

923
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,760
to actually enable not just power users,

924
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,000
because power users obviously is our largest concern,

925
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,020
but we also make it easy for anyone

926
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:35,180
who wants to try using the tiling manager,

927
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,420
because we see a lot of value in it.

928
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:40,660
Sure, and so is it fairly easily invoked?

929
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,540
Michael, if I'm a regular Gnome Shell user,

930
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,980
can I just start experimenting with this

931
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,340
and then turn it off if I don't like it?

932
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,140
How is that process gonna work for users?

933
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,980
Yeah, there's a pop-up menu

934
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,300
that you can toggle the features on and off.

935
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,340
Nice and easy.

936
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:55,580
I noticed that you've also added a launcher sort of facility,

937
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:58,000
and I'm wondering, what was the motivation there?

938
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,140
The motivation is simply that

939
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,260
if we're already doing searching for Windows,

940
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,380
you may as well just throw in applications launching as well.

941
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,860
Sure.

942
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,580
Okay, yeah, no, that makes sense.

943
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,780
I have kind of a technical nitty-gritty question

944
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:13,340
that surprised me when I noticed it.

945
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,840
And totally correct me if I'm wrong here,

946
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,060
but is TypeScript the primary language

947
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,780
being used to design this and write it?

948
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,100
Yes, it's the only.

949
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,940
Now, that is an interesting choice.

950
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,620
I've heard a little bit about TypeScript,

951
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,540
and what I've heard has impressed me,

952
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:29,420
but it wasn't probably what I assumed going into it.

953
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,700
I thought it'd be something super crazy,

954
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,140
like Rust, or really kind of high-level like that.

955
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,980
Can you talk a little bit about using TypeScript

956
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,340
and why it works for this?

957
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,540
Well, ideally, we would like to use Rust,

958
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,500
but you can't for GNOME extensions.

959
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:46,220
And using JavaScript is very painful if you're used to Rust.

960
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,060
I bet.

961
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,100
TypeScript is the best choice.

962
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,540
Have you run into any issues getting that all to work nicely?

963
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,180
I mean, I know TypeScript can compile down to JavaScript,

964
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,100
but any issues making that play nicely

965
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,660
with GNOME's implementation of JavaScript?

966
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,460
I have a sed script, which fixes

967
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,020
the little discrepancies.

968
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,340
Oh, that's perfect.

969
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,420
Yeah, that'll solve it.

970
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:08,020
So what's the long-term play here?

971
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:12,220
Is this going to develop into a full-fledged tiling extension?

972
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,580
Yeah, it's planning to do that.

973
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:20,100
What should our expectations be going into the 2004 release?

974
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:23,180
Much of what you would expect from I3,

975
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,740
it should work in here with this extension.

976
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,540
Wow.

977
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,660
And is it portable outside of POP?

978
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,220
Yeah.

979
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,020
Well, there you go.

980
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:30,580
Good to know.

981
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,860
You just have to be on a more recent version of GNOME Shell.

982
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:33,620
Definitely.

983
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,740
Yeah.

984
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,580
Well, that is the essential trick right there.

985
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:39,180
If people can try it out, it might draw more people in.

986
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,340
Maria, did you want to add something?

987
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:40,980
Go ahead.

988
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:44,900
Yeah, I wanted to add to the question of what to expect,

989
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,580
because I think one of the relatively big things we

990
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:51,380
are trying to achieve is to make it easy to switch

991
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:54,740
between floating mode and the outer tiling.

992
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:58,540
So I think we see that as somewhat of a big difference

993
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,940
compared to how most of the other tiling we know

994
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:01,900
managers work.

995
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,300
So you're saying it's kind of nice

996
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,900
because you can just easily switch in and out of the mode,

997
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,780
so whichever one works better for that moment.

998
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,580
Exactly.

999
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,780
Yeah, I can see that, right?

1000
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,340
You're in work, you got a lot of terminals up.

1001
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,220
Maybe you want that to be nicely laid out.

1002
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,340
And then you're at home on the couch,

1003
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,580
and you just got a couple, and it's

1004
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,900
easy to just operate normally.

1005
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,620
Can I apply it per workspace?

1006
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,820
Currently, you can.

1007
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:24,620
Oh, now that I would use the crap out of, for sure.

1008
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:27,580
Because I'm essentially doing it now manually on GNOME Shell

1009
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:31,740
on workspace two and three, dedicated to email and chat.

1010
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:32,780
That's great, guys.

1011
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,100
Yeah, that's the plan.

1012
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,860
Well, thank you for coming on and just telling us

1013
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:36,380
a little bit about it.

1014
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,140
We just wanted to kind of get some of these questions

1015
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,060
answered so that way we could talk about it intelligently

1016
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,460
and inform the audience.

1017
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,700
I appreciate you taking a few minutes to share it with us.

1018
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,700
Oh, of course.

1019
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,060
Thank you for inviting us.

1020
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,100
Oh, yeah, guys, for sure.

1021
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,420
Maybe we'll chat when it's all done, too.

1022
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,780
Is there anything else you want to add?

1023
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,220
No, it's just only that we are very

1024
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:54,020
excited about this extension coming up,

1025
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,500
and we keep working on it to make it the best user

1026
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,700
experience possible.

1027
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,620
We're excited about it, too.

1028
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,020
It's nice.

1029
00:38:59,020 --> 00:38:59,700
Definitely.

1030
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,740
And I think it's going to be a nice differentiator for Pop OS

1031
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,020
as well, which is pretty cool to see these things developing

1032
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,620
over time, which I suspected would start happening.

1033
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,740
Yeah, that was one of our main motivations.

1034
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:10,500
Yeah.

1035
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,380
Well, very cool.

1036
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,020
Well, I look forward to trying it out.

1037
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:13,980
Thank you.

1038
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,180
I'm feeling the hype.

1039
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,180
I want to try out that.

1040
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,220
I want to try out 20.04.

1041
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,300
It's pretty nice.

1042
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:23,780
And just having this as a little extension on top of GNOME,

1043
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,580
if you want some tiling, the auto tiling,

1044
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,540
it's kind of impressed.

1045
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,020
It just popped up a couple of windows,

1046
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:31,780
has the nice little edges, the gaps between windows.

1047
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:34,940
Even for being pretty new, not really released yet

1048
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:38,140
or ready for anyone to use it, they've come a long way,

1049
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,180
and I think it shows a lot of promise.

1050
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,500
So are we all cool with extensions now?

1051
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:42,980
Is that?

1052
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:43,940
Is that?

1053
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:44,620
I'm never sure.

1054
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,220
I'm never sure.

1055
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,220
There's an official tool, Chris.

1056
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,420
I'm always behind.

1057
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,640
I'm always the guy that's not for extensions,

1058
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,820
and everybody's using extensions,

1059
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,220
and I use all the extensions, and people don't

1060
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:52,820
use extensions.

1061
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,520
I mean, it might depend a little bit, too.

1062
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,380
GNOME 26 is throwing some resources behind this

1063
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,260
rather than a random one-off extension

1064
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,380
someone wrote two years ago.

1065
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,140
Is that it?

1066
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:01,580
That's it.

1067
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,180
That's the difference.

1068
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,500
I mean, that's a part of it.

1069
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,800
There are seemingly some fundamental issues,

1070
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,620
but I guess it does come down to does it work for you,

1071
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,140
and do you have issues with it?

1072
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,140
Kind of feels like things are shifting, though,

1073
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:16,460
with GNOME Shell shipping that official app and whatnot.

1074
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:17,500
I'd try it.

1075
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,820
I think I'd try it, especially if I could just go to GNOME

1076
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:23,100
extensions and just turn on, turn it off.

1077
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,700
And if anyone does want to play with it, it's really easy.

1078
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,860
You just need TypeScript installed.

1079
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,940
There's a makefile that'll build it and install it for you,

1080
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,220
so that's really easy.

1081
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,460
And you need to be on Pop OS 2004.

1082
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,860
Well, aren't you already?

1083
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,780
I just assume.

1084
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,380
There's that little detail as well.

1085
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,980
I did get a sneak peek at the Superfan event,

1086
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:43,260
and I was really blown away by what I had seen there,

1087
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,780
just even in that early development.

1088
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:48,540
So I think this is interesting, especially with extensions

1089
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:53,060
and the thought for me, anyway, that KDE, for me,

1090
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,580
kind of comes with everything baked in.

1091
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:57,260
You have to dig and hunt and find it and apply it

1092
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,180
and get it all set up.

1093
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,900
And that's cool, no problems with that.

1094
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:03,640
Whereas, to me, GNOME kind of takes a different angle,

1095
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:08,740
and here are extensions that you can add on to your system

1096
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,580
to add this additional functionality.

1097
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:13,140
So I think it's just two different ways

1098
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,140
to look at the same problem, personally.

1099
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,420
Yeah, I mean, I'm glad they're developing it.

1100
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,700
I'm glad they're putting the resources behind it.

1101
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,060
It's open source.

1102
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,900
It's going to be cross-distro.

1103
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,500
I think that's a net win overall.

1104
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,780
But I think it kind of makes our overall point

1105
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:30,340
that this is an OS that is really

1106
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:35,380
well-suited for advanced users, much like of previous eras

1107
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,980
where there were people who loved to build radios,

1108
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:41,380
or there were people who loved to tinker on cars.

1109
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:45,740
There's another generation now that is of a similar wiring

1110
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,620
and has found Linux, I think.

1111
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,300
That's so interesting.

1112
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,340
How else could System76 do this, right?

1113
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,900
I mean, they're not going to build their whole own operating

1114
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:54,420
system.

1115
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:57,580
That's probably too much to ask to secure and implement

1116
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,140
all these features.

1117
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:01,900
You can't really rebadge Windows or Mac.

1118
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,460
But Linux, have at it.

1119
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,460
I'm dying to hear what you think of it, Bopi.

1120
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,300
I think it's great that they're innovating

1121
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:10,500
on top of all the work that others are doing

1122
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,340
and being able to deliver what their customers ask for.

1123
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,440
So their customers clearly ask them

1124
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,700
for bespoke, beautiful computers that are high-performing

1125
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:24,260
and have open-source internals.

1126
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,180
And they've delivered.

1127
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,760
And now their customers are clearly

1128
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:30,220
asking them for features in the desktop that

1129
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:34,420
don't ship by default in either Ubuntu or upstream GNOME.

1130
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,900
So they're delivering them to their users.

1131
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,180
It's exactly what Linux is all about.

1132
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:42,660
You build a solution for the problem you have.

1133
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,140
They do have a pretty tight loop there,

1134
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:48,060
because they're the support for the hardware as well.

1135
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,700
So in theory, you're probably getting

1136
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,100
a decent amount of direct customer feedback,

1137
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:55,940
maybe in a channel that's more unique to traditional distros.

1138
00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:00,860
They have a really active Mattermost chat room,

1139
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:06,340
chat client thing, where customers and users who

1140
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:09,460
are clearly running Pop OS on something that's not a System

1141
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:12,780
76 hardware, and they're asking technical questions,

1142
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,760
and the developers are there.

1143
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,880
All the familiar names you know from System 76

1144
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,940
are in there answering their questions.

1145
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:23,060
So yeah, they have a direct line from their developers to users.

1146
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,940
Yeah, interesting.

1147
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,300
Would you give it a try?

1148
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:26,900
Yeah, sure.

1149
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:27,900
I'll give it a try.

1150
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,780
I didn't really get on super well

1151
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:31,500
with tiling window managers.

1152
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:35,200
And right now, I'm in a mode of trying

1153
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:39,340
to stay as close to upstream stock Ubuntu as possible,

1154
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:42,140
because we've got this little LTS release around the corner.

1155
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:44,420
So I kind of need to test that, yeah.

1156
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:46,900
Yeah, maybe an after-release kind of thing.

1157
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,460
Yeah, or on another machine.

1158
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:51,900
One of my other many, many, many thing pads, yes.

1159
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,900
Do you think it's daily driver for somebody

1160
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,180
who's willing to risk it?

1161
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,460
Well, what, 2004 or?

1162
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:58,380
Yeah, yeah.

1163
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:59,780
Yeah, totally.

1164
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:02,340
I mean, the standard caveat is don't,

1165
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:03,920
because it's not production ready yet,

1166
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,220
and it's not supported.

1167
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:09,420
But if you're an adventurous kind of gung-ho Linux

1168
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:12,180
enthusiast, then yeah, totally do it, totally.

1169
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:15,780
Feels like things are shaping up pretty good.

1170
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,540
Obviously, the last couple of releases

1171
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:18,780
have been really solid.

1172
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:21,300
But the ZFS support's getting to a special state.

1173
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,380
You've got this new release of Gnome Shell

1174
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:28,100
that's looking like it's going to be really good.

1175
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,340
Could be another one of those.

1176
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:31,920
I mean, you guys got to knock this off.

1177
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,060
You got to ship it late or something.

1178
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:35,580
This is a good one.

1179
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,540
I've been using it for a while, and since I've

1180
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:41,780
formatted my drive, I've got a clean install.

1181
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:45,100
And by crikey, this is faster than it was before.

1182
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,260
It really is.

1183
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,220
It's much better.

1184
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,300
So I'm really happy with this.

1185
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:49,800
Yeah.

1186
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,380
Wimpy tweeted recently, I think there's

1187
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:55,140
a lot to be optimistic about for the desktop, for Linux desktop.

1188
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:57,300
The other evening, I watched a live stream

1189
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:01,940
using Ubuntu Focal with Gnome 3.35 and Firefox.

1190
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:05,380
The streamer was using OBS on Ubuntu,

1191
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:08,660
and I was having a video call with a friend at the same time.

1192
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:09,460
And that's just it.

1193
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:14,060
It's like there are areas where Mac and Windows are going

1194
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:17,020
to have us beat for a bit, especially when it's working

1195
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:20,100
with an ecosystem of software developers and hardware.

1196
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,820
The industry that's already bought in.

1197
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:26,380
Maybe the elementary OS guys can help change some of that.

1198
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:32,020
But over time, we managed to check off another use case

1199
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:35,220
box, and then another one, and then another one.

1200
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:38,460
And then pretty soon, we're sitting here in the future

1201
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:41,300
using our Linux boxes to basically do everything

1202
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,700
all day long, every single day without issue.

1203
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:46,220
I mean, OK, maybe more people aren't flocking to use Proton,

1204
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:47,580
but that doesn't mean I can't use it.

1205
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:48,460
It works great for me.

1206
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:49,980
Yeah, and the truth of the matter

1207
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:53,220
is you and I are able to do our jobs full time in Linux,

1208
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:54,340
and it's not a compromise.

1209
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:56,720
It's not like bending over backwards like it used to be.

1210
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,420
I don't have any non-Linux devices,

1211
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,540
I mean, as long as you're including Android in there.

1212
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:02,940
Yeah, and whatever it is on your router.

1213
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:04,020
I mean, who knows?

1214
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:07,060
It's probably some net VSD.

1215
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:11,020
Yeah, and so for a lot of us, those boxes

1216
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:13,340
were checked a while ago, or for some of us,

1217
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:14,820
just checked recently.

1218
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:17,460
Thanks for listening, glad you just found us.

1219
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:20,580
Every year, it's like we check another one or just a few more.

1220
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:24,060
Sometimes it happens so subtly we don't even notice.

1221
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:28,220
So if you take a really, really long-term look at it,

1222
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,980
it's the best it's ever been right now,

1223
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:31,980
and it's pretty great.

1224
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:34,460
But if the momentum even continues at the pace

1225
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:37,340
it's been, eventually a few more boxes will get checked off.

1226
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:40,420
Another thing, I mean, you look at these improvements

1227
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:44,220
with like PipeWire and GNOME, who knows what's possible.

1228
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:48,260
Mr. Payne, before we go, what do you say we do some pics?

1229
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:50,260
Oh, yes, pics.

1230
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:52,580
I like this first one, Cat.

1231
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:55,860
Cast all the things allows you to send videos

1232
00:46:55,860 --> 00:47:00,340
from many, many online resources to your Chromecast,

1233
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:02,180
or local files, it turns out, too.

1234
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:03,980
Yes, I mean, so there's some tools

1235
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:05,700
that are great for sending local files.

1236
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,260
There are other tools or websites

1237
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,780
that work well if you want to stream from some URL

1238
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:13,260
that you've got, like maybe a HLS stream to the JV feed.

1239
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:14,900
Yeah, that works great.

1240
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,060
So that'd be a really super easy way

1241
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:17,500
to just take that URL and just get

1242
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:18,620
a blast of your Chromecast.

1243
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:21,700
Yes, without, you don't have to futz with Twitch or YouTube

1244
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,300
or any sort of thing that might show you ads

1245
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:24,980
or take over your display.

1246
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:26,700
Chromecast can just play links.

1247
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:29,420
And much like YouTube DL supports

1248
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:31,620
a lot more than YouTube, Cat seems

1249
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:33,380
to support all kinds of online services.

1250
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:35,660
So it has like integrated support for YouTube DL,

1251
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:36,980
so you can paste a YouTube link.

1252
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:38,500
Oh, it's literally using YouTube DL.

1253
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:42,420
Yes, and then YouTube DL will go grab the actual URL

1254
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:44,900
to that video, and then the Chromecast plays it directly,

1255
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:47,900
which again means you don't have to fuss about using YouTube.

1256
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,820
Yeah, or no browser with an extension, no Chrome required.

1257
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:53,580
Yes, oh, and if you have an MP4 file that you'd like to play,

1258
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:55,460
including subtitle support, let's say

1259
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:58,220
you've got those subtitle files already sitting on your disk,

1260
00:47:58,220 --> 00:47:59,420
Cat can do that too.

1261
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:00,700
And that's just over the land then.

1262
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:01,380
Yes.

1263
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:02,380
Hmm.

1264
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,260
I wonder if that even goes through the Google servers

1265
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:06,020
when you do an MP4 file like that.

1266
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:08,700
No, I think it just talks over the Chromecast advertise itself

1267
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,460
as over with MDNS.

1268
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:12,140
And the syntax is super simple, right?

1269
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:14,300
It's like cat command, and then what?

1270
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,580
Yeah, you can install it with pip because it's Python.

1271
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:19,580
And then cat, it's got a helpful little help doc to tell you,

1272
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:23,780
but cat cast, and then either your URL or a path

1273
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:25,100
to the file on your file system.

1274
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:27,340
How does it know which Chromecast to send it to?

1275
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:28,300
It will pick one.

1276
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:30,180
I don't know how it picks the device.

1277
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:33,180
It might be like a Google Home type setting involved,

1278
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:35,620
but it does have support for specifying the Chromecast.

1279
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:38,500
OK, so you could just give it a name of a Chromecast,

1280
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,180
and then it's all using probably MDNS, right?

1281
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:42,140
Cool, nice one.

1282
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:42,700
That's cat.

1283
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,440
We'll have a link to that in the show notes

1284
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,340
at linuxunplug.com slash 343.

1285
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:48,940
You can also tell it to just display.

1286
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:51,340
If you want to display a web page on your Chromecast

1287
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:54,180
without having to cast from your laptop, say, it can do that.

1288
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:56,380
And there's a config file, so you can make aliases

1289
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:58,720
for your Chromecast if it's got a long name or something

1290
00:48:58,720 --> 00:48:59,060
like that.

1291
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:00,600
You just want to use that all the time.

1292
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,080
So yeah, this is my new favorite Chromecast tool,

1293
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:06,420
and I strongly suspect it will be a part of my daily life.

1294
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:07,380
That's pretty cool.

1295
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:08,620
I'm going to get that too.

1296
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:09,740
Thanks for finding that.

1297
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:13,300
And then Mr. Bacon rolls in with the Silver Searcher this week.

1298
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,940
It's a code searching tool similar to ACK,

1299
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:18,880
but it says it has a focus on speed.

1300
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:19,540
I like that.

1301
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:20,580
I like it fast.

1302
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:25,780
Yeah, so buddy of mine recently reached out to me,

1303
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:28,660
and he was like, hey, have you ever used Silver Searcher

1304
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:30,480
or covered it in a pic?

1305
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,340
And I was like, I don't believe that we have.

1306
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:36,020
But essentially, it started off as a clone of ACK,

1307
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:40,500
and they claim that it's five to 10 times faster.

1308
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,460
So get on it.

1309
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:45,660
Get your code searching done quickly.

1310
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:46,780
What do you think, Wes?

1311
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:47,220
What do you think?

1312
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:48,540
You're going to do some code searching?

1313
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:49,940
You have something else you like.

1314
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:51,020
You want to do a third bony pic?

1315
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:53,280
Yeah, no, I definitely like the Silver Searcher.

1316
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,300
It's a fantastic program.

1317
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,780
But I mean, Chris, you've just got this rule now.

1318
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:00,060
Silver Searcher has a bunch of C involved.

1319
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:00,780
Oh, yeah, no C.

1320
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:01,860
You don't allow that.

1321
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:03,220
You're Rust only, as you make clear.

1322
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:04,940
Right, only Rust is what everybody knows.

1323
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:05,500
I say that.

1324
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:08,540
There's no C code allowed in the studio.

1325
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:11,060
So for that, I have RIPGRAP, which

1326
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:15,300
is in exactly the same sort of vein, but is made in Rust.

1327
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:16,480
And it's so fast.

1328
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,480
It's really just great.

1329
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,980
And because it's Rust, it's really easy.

1330
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:21,260
The release page, you can just go download a binary,

1331
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:23,380
stick it on your path somewhere, and away you go.

1332
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:25,220
I can't believe you managed to bring it.

1333
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:27,140
You know, we almost went the whole episode

1334
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,740
without our epic Rust watch.

1335
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:32,260
Technically, you've got to warn me.

1336
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:36,260
Epic Rust watch on Linux Unplugged.

1337
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:39,500
An update from Wes Payne on something else that uses Rust.

1338
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:40,100
There we go.

1339
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:40,860
See?

1340
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:42,500
I just, it's obligated.

1341
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,500
Yeah, ever since we hired that new soundboard guy,

1342
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,180
it's in the contract.

1343
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:48,740
Well, that brings us to the end of this week's program.

1344
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:50,100
Thank you so much for listening.

1345
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:52,540
Thank you to the Mumble Room for stopping by and hanging out

1346
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:54,460
with us here on a Tuesday.

1347
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:57,860
Next week is WSLConf, which has just

1348
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:00,700
been converted to an online-only conference,

1349
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:03,860
but come virtually say hi to us.

1350
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:04,900
We'll be there.

1351
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,340
Yeah, we'll be there.

1352
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:07,500
We're still going to be live.

1353
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:10,380
We've decided we'll still do the show at the regular time.

1354
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:11,100
So Tuesday.

1355
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:11,660
No excuse.

1356
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:13,060
Show up.

1357
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:17,340
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar for the lifetimes.

1358
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:18,260
I'm at Chris Lass.

1359
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:19,060
He's at Wes Payne.

1360
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:21,020
The show's at Linux Unplugged.

1361
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:23,480
Go check out the Ubuntu podcast, and we'll see you right back

1362
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,940
here next Tuesday.

1363
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:30,940
I'm Chris Lass.

1364
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:57,940
The Unplugged program.

1365
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:59,940
Ba-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba.

1366
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:02,260
All right, well, so JBot was down for a bit.

1367
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:03,660
It's back up now, JBtitles.com.

1368
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:05,740
Yeah, we didn't lose anything, so go vote.

1369
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:06,620
Oh, really?

1370
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:07,300
Keep suggesting.

1371
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:10,020
We've only got, it looks like, six of them right now.

1372
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:12,060
OK, OK.

1373
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:13,420
So we were talking about this earlier.

1374
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:15,660
I want to kind of go around and see if maybe people

1375
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:18,180
in the Mumble Room remember.

1376
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:21,180
Poppy, what was the first expansion slot standard

1377
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:24,500
that you recall when you started working on computers?

1378
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:27,220
Or working on computers that you dealt with?

1379
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:30,140
A standard, or just a slot that I would plug things into.

1380
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:32,380
The slot type.

1381
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:33,980
Mine was like when New Bus.

1382
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:37,300
And then I remember I had lots of ISA cards.

1383
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:38,840
That was sort of when I got into it.

1384
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:39,700
Yeah.

1385
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:44,740
Every time I watch retro gamers building 486 machines,

1386
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:48,700
and every time I see them with a Visa local bus

1387
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:52,420
on the end of the ISA slot, it makes me sad,

1388
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:53,700
because I backed that.

1389
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:58,220
And I bought loads of Visa local bus cards, super long ones.

1390
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:59,460
And that was a dumb idea.

1391
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:01,820
I should have waited and got PCI, because that

1392
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:03,380
was obviously the winner.

1393
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,020
But yeah, ISA was probably.

1394
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:10,420
I remember my first PC was an Epson 8086 with a turbo button.

1395
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,460
And it had ISA slots.

1396
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,340
And what were you putting, a modem in there,

1397
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:15,300
or a sound card or something, a Sound Blaster?

1398
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,740
I actually put an external floppy drive,

1399
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:20,140
because the internal floppy drive was 5 and 1 quarter inch.

1400
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:22,980
So I had to get an external 3 and 1 half inch,

1401
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:25,100
and had to put a card in for that.

1402
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:25,580
Right.

1403
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:27,660
Sure, you got to put a controller card in there

1404
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:29,980
with a big old cable to connect to the external drive.

1405
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:31,220
Oh yeah, it was beautiful.

1406
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:33,540
Beautiful white, pure white floppy drive.

1407
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:35,320
You need that full bus speed when

1408
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:38,260
you're reading those 3 and 1 half inch floppy disks.

1409
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:44,860
In fact, that first PC I had came with an MDA graphics card,

1410
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:47,280
monochrome display adapter, which did no graphics.

1411
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,820
It was text only.

1412
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:50,980
And I managed to acquire from where

1413
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:54,060
I worked, my very first job out of college,

1414
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:56,300
there was a Hercules graphics card kicking around.

1415
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:59,180
It was just kicking around in a cupboard, and I got that.

1416
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:01,340
And the upgrade from text only to graphics

1417
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:05,180
was just like chef kiss, so good.

1418
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:09,940
Oh, my first big video card I invested in was a Matrox AGP.

1419
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:11,340
Oh yeah, an AGP.

1420
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:14,500
It had an expansion RAM module as well.

1421
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:17,500
And it came with the first Tomb Raider PC game,

1422
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:20,700
as like a see what you can do with your upgrade.

1423
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:21,580
I was so dumb.

1424
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:23,980
I made the mistake of choosing a motherboard that

1425
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:25,340
had Visa local bus.

1426
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:28,900
But I also made the mistake of buying an IBM PS2 that

1427
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,700
had the microchannel architecture.

1428
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,460
So I couldn't buy any cards for that thing.

1429
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:35,060
That was just like, came with what it came with,

1430
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:37,020
you're never going to upgrade this thing.

1431
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:39,500
MCA, buddy, MCA, which they thought

1432
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,740
was going to be the big thing.

1433
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:46,940
I think my first graphics card was the Riva TNT2,

1434
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:51,220
or I think it was the Rage TNT2 for AGP.

1435
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:57,660
And then shortly after that, it was a PCI Trident 8 megabyte

1436
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:00,100
card so I could run Linux, because it

1437
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:01,220
wouldn't run into the AGP.

1438
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:02,660
Trident Video Cards.

1439
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:06,620
Oh, that name I've seen a million times.

1440
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:12,100
You know, the IBM PS2 was released April 1987,

1441
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,060
32 years ago.

1442
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:14,300
Wow.

1443
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:15,300
Yeah.

1444
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:19,140
Which, as the name suggests, is where the PS2 port came from.

1445
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:24,500
And it was a rocking way to run Windows 2.0.

1446
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:29,260
They also had a port of AIX to the PS2 back then,

1447
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:31,260
which sounds horrible.

1448
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:34,060
Could you imagine AIX on a 386 processor?

1449
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,100
I know, I don't want to.

1450
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:40,020
Oh, DOS was bad enough.

1451
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:41,020
It's a better world now.

1452
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:41,900
Yeah, it is.

1453
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:42,660
It is.

1454
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:43,300
What about you?

1455
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,180
Do you remember what your first interface was?

1456
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:48,580
I remember the thing about AGP, the thing that dawned on me

1457
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:51,460
was, oh, they're going to be changing this all the time.

1458
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:52,620
Like, they just kept getting, like.

1459
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:52,940
Yeah.

1460
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:55,460
I think AGP was the first time I was really sort of bought in

1461
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:59,180
and had got, like, an expensive card to attach to my machine

1462
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:01,340
before I just sort of stuck with the defaults.

1463
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:03,340
What about Mumble Room Carl or Brent?

1464
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:06,700
Either of you have old PC memories or byte?

1465
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:08,620
I stepped into the computer world

1466
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:12,540
when Windows 95 was around with the AGP.

1467
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:16,100
And I still have an AGP video card around.

1468
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:18,340
Yeah, that's coming in handy one day.

1469
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:19,100
You might need it.

1470
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:19,740
You never know.

1471
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:23,100
Surely there's, like, a Thunderbolt AGP adapter.

1472
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:26,260
It still has the VGA and the S-video out on it.

1473
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:27,740
Oh, yeah, of course.

1474
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:30,220
Man, VGA is still around.

1475
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:34,900
I think I had an S-video out was my AGP card at the time.

1476
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:37,820
And I had an old TV I was using with a second monitor.

1477
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:38,500
It was gross.

1478
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,900
Yeah, yeah.

1479
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:43,020
I remember when I finally got my hands on a Sony Trinitron

1480
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:45,100
CRT, which was the flat CRT.

1481
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:47,220
Yeah, really nice.

1482
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:48,180
Really nice screens.

1483
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:49,460
Yeah, I remember those.

1484
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:51,860
I still have a Trinitron at my mom's house.

1485
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:56,140
My very first TV I bought with my own money was in 1988.

1486
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:58,380
And it was a 14-inch Sony Trinitron.

1487
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:02,220
And I watched The Matrix on DVD when that first came out

1488
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:05,500
on that 14-inch in widescreen letterbox format.

1489
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,620
Oh, happy days.

1490
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:09,980
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
