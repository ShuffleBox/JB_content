WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.760
Just three hours ago, no, two hours ago as we started recording, Google has made their

00:09.760 --> 00:15.960
big announcement about Stadia, the streaming service that all runs on top of Linux and

00:15.960 --> 00:16.960
Vulkan.

00:16.960 --> 00:17.960
Have you had a chance to see this, Wes?

00:17.960 --> 00:18.960
I know we've been really busy today.

00:18.960 --> 00:20.120
Only just a little bit.

00:20.120 --> 00:24.720
I saw some headlines and I said, I'm going to have to dig into this later.

00:24.720 --> 00:30.120
So this is the evolution of that streaming beta, I guess, you could trial run, maybe.

00:30.120 --> 00:31.840
Yeah, which I have been using.

00:31.840 --> 00:34.440
So I'm curious to see just how much better it is.

00:34.440 --> 00:36.120
That already works on Linux.

00:36.120 --> 00:41.160
But the thing that was crazy is in this keynote and there's a big slide up on the screen that

00:41.160 --> 00:42.720
says Linux and Vulkan.

00:42.720 --> 00:47.160
If you want your games to work on this platform, write your game for Linux.

00:47.160 --> 00:48.160
Wow.

00:48.160 --> 00:50.240
That is, that's different.

00:50.240 --> 00:51.240
I'm very excited.

00:51.240 --> 00:53.960
I mean, I'm also skeptical about streaming games.

00:53.960 --> 00:57.840
I've had some experience, some have been great, some have been flawed.

00:57.840 --> 01:04.000
So there is definitely room for mistakes to be made, for this not to be that great.

01:04.000 --> 01:09.120
However, Google's kind of making the case, look, we can throw essentially unlimited GPUs

01:09.120 --> 01:10.120
at your problem.

01:10.120 --> 01:11.120
That sounds pretty good, doesn't it?

01:11.120 --> 01:12.120
I was a game developer.

01:12.120 --> 01:13.480
I'm like, hmm.

01:13.480 --> 01:18.640
The other thing they demoed, this is really where I could see this working, is play now

01:18.640 --> 01:22.760
buttons like right next to a YouTube video about a game and within and they showed up

01:22.760 --> 01:28.800
on screen within five seconds, the game is streaming to your PC or your whatever it is

01:28.800 --> 01:30.280
and you're just playing the game immediately.

01:30.280 --> 01:35.520
And in many ways, many games are already operated as like an online service anyway.

01:35.520 --> 01:37.400
So now you're just not running their proprietary client.

01:37.400 --> 01:39.320
You're just getting shipped some frames.

01:39.320 --> 01:40.840
The browser is the platform.

01:40.840 --> 01:45.800
But what I'm going to watch with a lot of interest, I mean, it's the gaming service.

01:45.800 --> 01:46.800
That's kind of neat.

01:46.800 --> 01:47.800
I'll watch that too.

01:47.800 --> 01:52.600
But what I'm really going to watch with interest is does this lead to more Linux games using

01:52.600 --> 01:53.640
Vulkan?

01:53.640 --> 01:55.360
That's going to be a massive win for Linux users.

01:55.360 --> 01:56.360
Right.

01:56.360 --> 01:59.160
Not just like the first order of games that run on Linux, but just that being a standard

01:59.160 --> 02:00.400
people are trained to do.

02:00.400 --> 02:03.800
That makes it more, you know, there'll be more documentation, more developer know how

02:03.800 --> 02:06.240
it will benefit the community at large.

02:06.240 --> 02:07.440
Here's what I'm thinking.

02:07.440 --> 02:13.000
Even if like desktop Linux isn't enough of a reason for developers to be incentivized

02:13.000 --> 02:18.920
to target Linux, somebody like Google coming along and saying, here's Stadia and or Stadia,

02:18.920 --> 02:24.400
however you say it, and it has five million users thanks to us tying it in with YouTube.

02:24.400 --> 02:28.240
So write your games for that, because that's going to get eyes like that.

02:28.240 --> 02:31.760
That seems like there's potential there, doesn't it?

02:31.760 --> 02:40.840
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 293 for March 19th, 2019.

02:40.840 --> 02:52.520
Well, hello there and welcome into Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's hitting

02:52.520 --> 02:54.840
the road and barely surviving.

02:54.840 --> 02:56.600
My name is Chris.

02:56.600 --> 02:57.600
My name is Wes.

02:57.600 --> 03:00.840
And oh my gosh, I am so happy you're alive.

03:00.840 --> 03:06.600
Well, I'll tell you just in a brief moment about how I was almost taken hostage yesterday.

03:06.600 --> 03:09.680
But but first, I'll tell you what's coming up on this week's episode.

03:09.680 --> 03:13.000
If you're a Debian user, we've got some great news for you.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.680
If you're a SUSE user, we've got good news for you.

03:15.680 --> 03:19.640
And a brand new Linux desktop just got a great new release.

03:19.640 --> 03:25.000
And we'll talk about the troubles that our favorite open source project for Plasma and

03:25.000 --> 03:29.640
Android users, KDE Connect, will tell you about the problems that they're running into

03:29.640 --> 03:31.560
with the old Google Play Store this week.

03:31.560 --> 03:35.640
But later on in the show, once we really get in our groove, we're going to talk about

03:35.640 --> 03:37.960
eBPF in practice.

03:37.960 --> 03:44.760
There is some amazing performance monitoring, hacking, testing tools that have come to Linux.

03:44.760 --> 03:48.760
And one of the best things that happened to us at scale is Wes and I got to attend Brandon

03:48.760 --> 03:51.380
Gregg's talk on performance hacking.

03:51.380 --> 03:56.200
And we watched in real time as he diagnosed all kinds of performance issues with Minecraft.

03:56.200 --> 04:01.040
Well, we took away a few of those essentials, a couple of practical examples, and we're

04:01.040 --> 04:05.720
going to cover them, what it means for us Linux users, and why the kernel devs are so,

04:05.720 --> 04:07.760
so excited about this new feature.

04:07.760 --> 04:09.120
It's big stuff.

04:09.120 --> 04:12.480
And if we have a little bit of time left, we've got some feedback too.

04:12.480 --> 04:15.920
But before we get any further, you guys know what time it is.

04:15.920 --> 04:17.640
It's time to bring in that mumble room.

04:17.640 --> 04:19.440
Time appropriate greetings, virtual lug.

04:19.440 --> 04:20.440
Hello.

04:20.440 --> 04:21.440
Hey.

04:21.440 --> 04:22.440
Good afternoon.

04:22.440 --> 04:23.440
Hello.

04:23.440 --> 04:26.800
Nice to have you all here.

04:26.800 --> 04:30.640
So most of the web runs on servers powered by Linux.

04:30.640 --> 04:33.280
You know, I have to say most of the web runs on servers powered by Linux.

04:33.280 --> 04:34.900
I just I just came up with that.

04:34.900 --> 04:39.280
Now, what do you say, guys, before we get into the news, can we have a little storytime

04:39.280 --> 04:40.280
with Chris?

04:40.280 --> 04:41.920
I had to tell Wes about this.

04:41.920 --> 04:45.960
Wes and Wes Allen, she's already know about this because I this was crazy.

04:45.960 --> 04:48.760
I've never had anything like this happen to be in my life.

04:48.760 --> 04:56.840
But yesterday, my wife, my dog and possibly my home were all at risk of being taken hostage

04:56.840 --> 04:58.400
or worse.

04:58.400 --> 05:05.160
It was an insane situation that thankfully I can now sit here and laugh about.

05:05.160 --> 05:10.560
However, about this time, 24 hours ago, I could not.

05:10.560 --> 05:16.320
So I'll start with you have this thing called BLM land, and it's it's a beautiful gift from

05:16.320 --> 05:17.320
the federal government.

05:17.320 --> 05:21.200
It's the Bureau of Land Management has all of these areas where you can go take your

05:21.200 --> 05:24.680
RV and you can park for free for 14 days.

05:24.680 --> 05:25.680
Isn't that great?

05:25.680 --> 05:26.680
14 days.

05:26.680 --> 05:27.680
You can go somewhere.

05:27.680 --> 05:29.960
It's just fantastic.

05:29.960 --> 05:34.480
And as we were driving along, going back up to Seattle from Texas, we found this great

05:34.480 --> 05:39.280
spot in Arizona where we could pull off of the I-10 highway for a little while and get

05:39.280 --> 05:40.700
fantastic cell signal.

05:40.700 --> 05:42.040
That way we could still get some work done.

05:42.040 --> 05:44.880
And we've got these new lithium ion batteries that we had installed.

05:44.880 --> 05:47.520
So I knew we had like a couple of days of working time.

05:47.520 --> 05:49.100
We go there, we park.

05:49.100 --> 05:50.120
Beautiful cell signal.

05:50.120 --> 05:52.000
Nobody is around.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.660
Gorgeous view of the mountains.

05:53.660 --> 05:57.760
So we pull in late at night and we get set up and sleep great because it's under the

05:57.760 --> 05:58.760
stars.

05:58.760 --> 05:59.760
It's silent.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.840
It's it's just a gorgeous location.

06:01.840 --> 06:06.800
And about midday, after working for most of the day and attending meetings and listening

06:06.800 --> 06:12.360
to a great episode of Kota Radio, somebody comes knocking on my door and open up the

06:12.360 --> 06:17.560
door and it's it's a rough looking fella.

06:17.560 --> 06:24.760
Somebody who's who's seen who's seen the inside of a jail cell a few times and just rough

06:24.760 --> 06:25.760
looking guy.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.200
And he's got a weapon on his side.

06:28.200 --> 06:29.200
Oh no.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.200
Mm hmm.

06:30.200 --> 06:34.760
And it didn't take me more than I mean, I mean, I immediately kind of assess what was

06:34.760 --> 06:36.200
going on.

06:36.200 --> 06:38.320
And I was a little drunk at the time.

06:38.320 --> 06:43.320
So really not on your A game, tired from a long day of driving, I'm sure preparing to

06:43.320 --> 06:44.320
relax.

06:44.320 --> 06:45.320
It was the end of the day.

06:45.320 --> 06:49.680
It was about three thirty and we had been driving forever, had been working since four

06:49.680 --> 06:50.680
a.m.

06:50.680 --> 06:53.160
So it had been a very long day at this point.

06:53.160 --> 06:55.320
And Hadid was about to start make dinner.

06:55.320 --> 06:58.760
So I poured myself a glass of whiskey, turned the old TV on, and that's when the door got

06:58.760 --> 06:59.760
a knock on.

06:59.760 --> 07:01.000
Boom, boom, boom.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Open it up.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.900
Hey, man, can I have some gas?

07:04.900 --> 07:05.900
We're all out.

07:05.900 --> 07:08.480
And I'm looking around and says he's got this.

07:08.480 --> 07:10.920
He's got an RV that he says he got for free.

07:10.920 --> 07:13.680
I don't know if he stole it or what, but it's really bad shape.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.800
Like there's parts on the side that are missing.

07:15.800 --> 07:18.560
It's got it's the suspension has collapsed on the rear, right?

07:18.560 --> 07:19.560
It's in bad shape.

07:19.560 --> 07:21.680
He says, we're all out of gas and I could use a little gas.

07:21.680 --> 07:25.200
And I'm looking around, I'm thinking to myself, well, what are you doing?

07:25.200 --> 07:29.640
What are you doing this far off the highway up in the mountains?

07:29.640 --> 07:30.640
Why?

07:30.640 --> 07:32.840
Like, that's not where you go when you run out of gas, right?

07:32.840 --> 07:34.280
You pull off on the side of the road.

07:34.280 --> 07:39.040
You don't go down a long, windy road where there's absolutely nobody, right?

07:39.040 --> 07:41.720
No gas stations, no gas stations.

07:41.720 --> 07:45.720
And so, you know, half drunk me, I'm like, well, all right, man, let's do this.

07:45.720 --> 07:50.360
Like I'm just thinking we could just throw a hose down my, you know, my where we put

07:50.360 --> 07:54.640
gas in the gas cap and I'll just siphon off a couple of gallons and they'll be on their

07:54.640 --> 07:55.640
way.

07:55.640 --> 07:58.940
So the guy goes back to his RV for a couple of minutes and he walks up and he's got these

07:58.940 --> 08:03.560
small little like two foot hoses and a couple of like connectors.

08:03.560 --> 08:07.520
And I look at it and I can see, I can see it's something that they've used a lot.

08:07.520 --> 08:11.960
Like they're going around to different rigs and they're disconnecting the gas line and

08:11.960 --> 08:14.640
they're hooking up to that and they're filling their rig up with gas and that's how they're

08:14.640 --> 08:15.640
getting down the road.

08:15.640 --> 08:19.980
And this all starts clicking because I can realize, oh, he wants to disconnect my gas

08:19.980 --> 08:24.080
line and take my gas, but they don't have any way of fixing it.

08:24.080 --> 08:25.080
So then I would be stranded.

08:25.080 --> 08:28.320
And then a couple of other guys step out of the RV.

08:28.320 --> 08:31.080
They also have weapons.

08:31.080 --> 08:38.040
And then three mastiff dogs, you know, the big dogs, mastiffs and one husky dog get out

08:38.040 --> 08:41.160
of this tiny RV and they all start walking towards us.

08:41.160 --> 08:42.160
This is insane.

08:42.160 --> 08:43.360
It's getting a little tense, right?

08:43.360 --> 08:47.560
And so I'm trying to just be nice, trying to empathize with their situation a little

08:47.560 --> 08:52.120
bit, figuring like if I resist, then, you know, they're desperate.

08:52.120 --> 08:53.280
They're going to take what they need.

08:53.280 --> 08:56.960
But if I can, if I can cooperate a little bit, maybe they'll just, you know, they'll

08:56.960 --> 08:57.960
be cool.

08:57.960 --> 09:01.320
And so I'm looking at different ways like we can disconnect the gas line because, you

09:01.320 --> 09:05.200
know, like I don't have a lot of options here and I'm like, there's just no way I'm comfortable

09:05.200 --> 09:06.200
with this.

09:06.200 --> 09:09.480
So I'm talking to them some more and trying to get an idea of what they're looking for.

09:09.480 --> 09:13.960
And I walk them back over to their RV to kind of look at what their different options are.

09:13.960 --> 09:17.040
And so I suggest to them, I say, hey, well, why don't we do this?

09:17.040 --> 09:20.440
Why don't one of you guys just come with me and I'll just drive you to the gas station.

09:20.440 --> 09:21.440
We'll fill up some gas.

09:21.440 --> 09:22.440
I'll even pay for it.

09:22.440 --> 09:23.440
Okay.

09:23.440 --> 09:24.440
Yeah, that'd be great.

09:24.440 --> 09:32.640
So if one guy grabs a gun, grabs a knife and comes and gets in the RV, he's ready to go.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.920
The other two guys and the dog stay behind.

09:34.920 --> 09:40.980
So Hadia, Levi and I take this guy down the road to go fill up a couple of gas cans.

09:40.980 --> 09:44.600
And then when we bring him back, oh, and I should say, you know, I'm trying to be nice

09:44.600 --> 09:45.600
to the guy.

09:45.600 --> 09:46.600
So like we're at the gas station.

09:46.600 --> 09:51.040
I offer him a couple of beers, you know, just trying to loosen him up a little bit and get

09:51.040 --> 09:53.320
him, you know, get a couple of gas cans filled up.

09:53.320 --> 09:55.360
And when I say gas cans, I mean like milk jugs.

09:55.360 --> 10:00.280
They had milk jugs and water jugs that we just filled with gasoline and then put caps

10:00.280 --> 10:01.280
on it.

10:01.280 --> 10:02.760
But that's all we had.

10:02.760 --> 10:03.760
Good lord.

10:03.760 --> 10:04.760
Yeah.

10:04.760 --> 10:10.200
And then we got back and it was like this process of trying to get rid of them and not

10:10.200 --> 10:13.360
not like show our hand that much.

10:13.360 --> 10:18.000
It was one of those moments in life where you had a sense this can go two ways.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.640
I can either play ball and just kind of try to help these guys out a little bit or I can

10:22.640 --> 10:26.360
resist like, you know, when he walked up to my door, I could have told him to eff off

10:26.360 --> 10:29.840
and that could have just started a whole thing, right?

10:29.840 --> 10:33.560
Because they were they were stuck and they needed to get going again.

10:33.560 --> 10:37.460
I have a sense they had somewhere to be and they had to get there fast or somewhere not

10:37.460 --> 10:38.460
to be.

10:38.460 --> 10:39.460
Yeah.

10:39.460 --> 10:40.460
Or somewhere not to be.

10:40.460 --> 10:44.520
And so it took another couple of hours to get them to go.

10:44.520 --> 10:46.680
Hadia made them dinner even.

10:46.680 --> 10:51.560
And after they ate and filled their rig up with a little bit of gas that they got, we

10:51.560 --> 10:54.920
gave them like 10 bucks and quarters and they left.

10:54.920 --> 11:00.100
And man, it was a weird experience because like you start replaying like the 50 different

11:00.100 --> 11:04.360
decisions that you made along the way that probably made this go the right way and how

11:04.360 --> 11:08.720
each in each one of those situations, it could have gone really south.

11:08.720 --> 11:10.680
Like they could have been dismantling my RV.

11:10.680 --> 11:13.560
Like best case, they would have dismantled my RV.

11:13.560 --> 11:15.300
Worst case, they would have stolen it.

11:15.300 --> 11:16.960
Maybe with my dog and my lady inside it.

11:16.960 --> 11:19.780
Like who knows what would have happened?

11:19.780 --> 11:23.640
It was weird and I've never had an experience like that on the road before.

11:23.640 --> 11:29.560
And it was a damn shame, Wes, because it's a beautiful work spot with just full cellular

11:29.560 --> 11:30.560
signal.

11:30.560 --> 11:31.560
No one around.

11:31.560 --> 11:34.080
And you were chased off by these hooligans.

11:34.080 --> 11:35.080
Wow.

11:35.080 --> 11:36.080
Well, we thought about it.

11:36.080 --> 11:37.640
We're like, should we stay or should we go now?

11:37.640 --> 11:39.400
Because they left and we thought about it.

11:39.400 --> 11:42.500
And you know, I had to sober up a little bit because I'd had some drinks.

11:42.500 --> 11:45.820
And so while I was sobering up, I was trying to decide what I wanted to do.

11:45.820 --> 11:48.720
And while they were here, I was drinking with them, too, you know, trying to keep everybody

11:48.720 --> 11:50.160
social, keep everybody happy.

11:50.160 --> 11:52.800
So I'm sitting here, I'm drinking whiskey and ciders.

11:52.800 --> 11:53.800
That is impressive.

11:53.800 --> 11:57.680
You really just picked up right up on that and befriended them in ways like you're saying

11:57.680 --> 11:58.840
most people probably would not have.

11:58.840 --> 11:59.840
Yeah.

11:59.840 --> 12:03.320
I mean, it was like so I had but then like so but like, I'm also like there's a clock

12:03.320 --> 12:06.560
in the back of my head going like you're you're diminishing your ability to escape.

12:06.560 --> 12:12.280
Like I kept trying to arrange it so that way Hedia and Levi and the awning would all be

12:12.280 --> 12:16.440
in like we'd have the awning in the dog would be in the RV, Hedia would be in the RV.

12:16.440 --> 12:20.960
So if at any moment something went really south, I was going to try to run into my RV,

12:20.960 --> 12:23.240
start it up and just take off.

12:23.240 --> 12:26.680
But that's not a super fast process because we have like these leveling jacks and shit.

12:26.680 --> 12:27.680
Oh, no.

12:27.680 --> 12:31.360
It wouldn't have been smooth as they're firing up.

12:31.360 --> 12:35.100
And I just kept trying to like I kept trying to arrange it so that way like we had we could

12:35.100 --> 12:37.200
escape if we had to.

12:37.200 --> 12:38.880
But a lot of times that just wasn't an option.

12:38.880 --> 12:43.120
And I just had to like I just had to hang out with these guys and like drink with them

12:43.120 --> 12:46.720
and talk about their time in jail and talk about how one of them is trying to go get

12:46.720 --> 12:49.160
his kid and another guy was talking about how his wife died.

12:49.160 --> 12:53.600
Now he's now he's called now he's calling himself a preacher.

12:53.600 --> 12:59.160
Who apparently makes money by selling tricks at gas stations from what I could pick up.

12:59.160 --> 13:02.000
And it was really like none of their stories checked out.

13:02.000 --> 13:07.520
Like each guy had a different story that didn't really sync up with the other guy's story.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.120
Like they hadn't coordinated that at all.

13:09.120 --> 13:15.360
I got to ask, they didn't happen to find out the name of this show, did they?

13:15.360 --> 13:17.240
No loose stickers laying around, right?

13:17.240 --> 13:18.240
Yeah.

13:18.240 --> 13:19.240
Yeah.

13:19.240 --> 13:22.640
That's why we got to change all the logos now because they know the show logo.

13:22.640 --> 13:25.620
So we got new logos.

13:25.620 --> 13:27.200
It was weird.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.460
And Hedia was really shaken up.

13:29.460 --> 13:34.040
And you know, it's so I had to roll with it so fast that there was moments where she didn't

13:34.040 --> 13:38.440
know if I was just being blissfully unaware of how much danger we were in.

13:38.440 --> 13:39.440
Right.

13:39.440 --> 13:40.440
You couldn't communicate.

13:40.440 --> 13:41.440
Right.

13:41.440 --> 13:44.200
Because she thought maybe Chris just thinks he's making buddies with some RV guys.

13:44.200 --> 13:48.240
But there was a couple of times, like three times we were able to exchange a couple of

13:48.240 --> 13:53.680
looks that were like, yeah, I know what's going on, you know, and and then afterwards

13:53.680 --> 13:55.360
we finally got a chance to talk about it.

13:55.360 --> 13:58.520
Like, you know, just like, can you believe that just happened?

13:58.520 --> 13:59.800
Like, it was huge.

13:59.800 --> 14:05.680
So we sat there decompressing for like a couple of hours sobering up and then I thought, I

14:05.680 --> 14:06.680
got to go.

14:06.680 --> 14:07.680
I can't stay here.

14:07.680 --> 14:11.040
I got to keep going because, you know, those guys are going down the road.

14:11.040 --> 14:15.200
But if something goes wrong or they run out of gas, well, they know where to come back

14:15.200 --> 14:16.360
now.

14:16.360 --> 14:18.100
They know where to find me.

14:18.100 --> 14:20.160
So I got to keep going.

14:20.160 --> 14:25.600
But it it totally sucked because that's where I was going to record today's show.

14:25.600 --> 14:26.600
It's I mean, it does.

14:26.600 --> 14:27.760
It did sound like a beautiful spot.

14:27.760 --> 14:28.760
Yeah.

14:28.760 --> 14:29.760
What a shame.

14:29.760 --> 14:32.640
I ended up getting down the road another three hours and now we're just outside of L.A.

14:32.640 --> 14:38.160
I wonder I wonder if after after they left, if for a moment there like I don't know my

14:38.160 --> 14:43.220
mental image is just this group of like vigilantes or whatever this these vandals and they're

14:43.220 --> 14:46.120
like, you know, that Chris guy, he was a really nice guy.

14:46.120 --> 14:48.160
You just like killed him with kindness.

14:48.160 --> 14:49.160
I did.

14:49.160 --> 14:52.400
I tried to I try to just be accommodating and be a good host and kill him with kindness

14:52.400 --> 14:56.640
and empathize with their situation and try not to be judgmental about about the fact

14:56.640 --> 14:58.840
that they're probably all outlaws on the run.

14:58.840 --> 15:03.060
You know, I just I just tried to roll with it and and just try to because everybody everybody

15:03.060 --> 15:04.720
goes through a hard time.

15:04.720 --> 15:07.560
I was trying to look at it from that perspective.

15:07.560 --> 15:11.680
And the guy ended up like talking to me about his kid and how he's going to go try to get

15:11.680 --> 15:16.480
his kid from Georgia and problems he's having with his ex-wife like in a way we made like

15:16.480 --> 15:19.120
a genuine human connection.

15:19.120 --> 15:24.000
It's just that no moment was I under any false pretenses that these are my new best friends.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
It was weird.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.860
It was it was really something.

15:26.860 --> 15:30.720
And so then after it happened, I had to get in our group chat and I had to tell you guys

15:30.720 --> 15:33.760
all about it last night because it was just one of the craziest things that ever happened

15:33.760 --> 15:34.760
to me.

15:34.760 --> 15:38.800
And I can only really tell you half the story, right, because otherwise it take up the whole

15:38.800 --> 15:39.800
show.

15:39.800 --> 15:42.800
But, man, am I glad to be here today doing the show right now.

15:42.800 --> 15:45.240
And finally, I'm glad I found another quiet spot to record.

15:45.240 --> 15:47.160
Chris, I'm really looking forward to your memoir.

15:47.160 --> 15:48.160
I hope that comes out soon.

15:48.160 --> 15:49.160
No doubt.

15:49.160 --> 15:50.160
Right.

15:50.160 --> 15:51.440
One hundred percent agree with that, Bruce.

15:51.440 --> 15:53.040
This would have made a hell of a vlog episode.

15:53.040 --> 15:55.760
I'm just saying.

15:55.760 --> 15:56.760
But I don't know.

15:56.760 --> 15:58.560
I just who I am.

15:58.560 --> 16:02.960
I did post a picture on my Instagram, which I don't use very often, but insta Chris last

16:02.960 --> 16:06.600
where I put I posted a picture of the workspace.

16:06.600 --> 16:10.800
You can see the you can see the intro where Apollo in the picture, too.

16:10.800 --> 16:13.240
And that was it was just so nice.

16:13.240 --> 16:16.040
And you could walk and, you know, didn't have to put Levi on leash.

16:16.040 --> 16:20.240
He could run around and it was so cool, but, you know, got to move on.

16:20.240 --> 16:21.240
Got to be safe.

16:21.240 --> 16:22.680
That looks like a great spot.

16:22.680 --> 16:27.320
But when you're so far out from society, you kind of forget that there are different or

16:27.320 --> 16:28.320
fewer laws.

16:28.320 --> 16:29.320
Yeah.

16:29.320 --> 16:34.440
And it was funny how they several times mentioned, you know, out here in the desert.

16:34.440 --> 16:35.440
Mm hmm.

16:35.440 --> 16:36.440
Yeah.

16:36.440 --> 16:37.440
OK.

16:37.440 --> 16:38.440
I get it.

16:38.440 --> 16:39.440
I get it.

16:39.440 --> 16:40.440
I got it.

16:40.440 --> 16:41.440
OK.

16:41.440 --> 16:42.440
Is that what they sounded like?

16:42.440 --> 16:43.440
A little bit, actually.

16:43.440 --> 16:44.440
They all had a little.

16:44.440 --> 16:50.060
Yeah, they all had a little drawl, but they were also they seemed like they were on something

16:50.060 --> 16:54.400
that I don't know what it would be, but they didn't like that glossy eyes and stuff.

16:54.400 --> 16:56.880
And they had a little bit of coordination issues sometimes.

16:56.880 --> 16:59.400
And so I don't know what was going on.

16:59.400 --> 17:00.400
Maybe they were drunk.

17:00.400 --> 17:01.840
Maybe maybe it was something else.

17:01.840 --> 17:04.440
But who tell you what?

17:04.440 --> 17:07.960
That's my that's my probably my craziest road adventure yet.

17:07.960 --> 17:11.120
I thought getting hit by a semi truck, but no, that's that's this tops it.

17:11.120 --> 17:16.020
Were there a bunch more RVs out that like whenever you were heading out onto the land,

17:16.020 --> 17:19.700
did you like pass by a bunch more rigs and stuff or were you out there just kind of all

17:19.700 --> 17:22.600
desolate and these guys just roll up on you?

17:22.600 --> 17:23.600
Yep.

17:23.600 --> 17:24.600
Hundred percent.

17:24.600 --> 17:25.600
It was just us.

17:25.600 --> 17:26.600
That's why it's really weird.

17:26.600 --> 17:27.840
Like you're running out of gas.

17:27.840 --> 17:33.920
You don't you don't come down this road to find gas unless you unless you think there's

17:33.920 --> 17:38.240
a good chance there could be some RVers down there where you could go steal some gas because

17:38.240 --> 17:42.020
it is a like there's a few websites that list the spot that we were at.

17:42.020 --> 17:43.120
That's how we found it.

17:43.120 --> 17:48.040
So it's a known camping spot and it's a legal spot for you to go camp on federal land for

17:48.040 --> 17:49.040
up to 14 days.

17:49.040 --> 17:53.320
Do you think they were out there just because they wanted good cell phone signals as well?

17:53.320 --> 17:54.320
Yeah.

17:54.320 --> 17:55.320
Yeah.

17:55.320 --> 17:59.440
They got to make sure that, you know, their podcast has good signal.

17:59.440 --> 18:00.440
Everybody's hustling.

18:00.440 --> 18:05.320
I mean, if it's working out the gas station, you know, who knows, right?

18:05.320 --> 18:06.320
All right.

18:06.320 --> 18:07.320
Well, let's talk a little Linux.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.900
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

18:09.900 --> 18:16.320
Last week on the show, we discussed the leadership challenges facing the Debian project.

18:16.320 --> 18:20.960
Since then, clearly because we covered on the show, there is now at least five candidates

18:20.960 --> 18:25.360
and likely more that have emerged.

18:25.360 --> 18:27.500
And it's an interesting group of people.

18:27.500 --> 18:34.600
They all seem to have all five on this first list here all seem to have fairly long connections

18:34.600 --> 18:35.760
with the Debian project.

18:35.760 --> 18:39.240
I think one of the shortest one is from 2007.

18:39.240 --> 18:41.120
I guess that's a good crop of candidates.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.760
Why do you think it took so long for people to put their name forward?

18:43.760 --> 18:44.760
I don't know.

18:44.760 --> 18:50.280
I hate to speculate that it's because of some of the issues the project may be facing, but

18:50.280 --> 18:51.840
it's hard to say.

18:51.840 --> 18:56.840
The leadership position is also not necessarily one that is purely technical, and it could

18:56.840 --> 19:01.880
be that people that are interested in the Debian project perhaps have more of a technical

19:01.880 --> 19:02.880
inclination.

19:02.880 --> 19:05.640
You know, they want to scratch that itch and not so much of a political itch, which the

19:05.640 --> 19:08.240
leadership position is a little more of politics than it is development.

19:08.240 --> 19:09.240
Yes, right.

19:09.240 --> 19:12.440
I mean, it is in many ways, you're performing a service for the project.

19:12.440 --> 19:16.200
It takes time and commitment, and it may not be the little thing that is the most interesting

19:16.200 --> 19:19.000
in maintaining and being a part of the project.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.400
Each candidate in the list here is really fascinating.

19:21.400 --> 19:27.920
A couple that jumped out at me, Jonathan Carter has been a Debian developer since 2017.

19:27.920 --> 19:32.500
And I believe he also maintains a fair few packages, including most of the gnome shell

19:32.500 --> 19:34.720
stuff in Debian.

19:34.720 --> 19:39.720
Another candidate, Sam Hartman is interesting because he's been a Debian developer since

19:39.720 --> 19:40.840
2000.

19:40.840 --> 19:46.240
He's best known for the maintenance of the Debian Kerberos packages, and he's blind.

19:46.240 --> 19:47.840
I think that that's great.

19:47.840 --> 19:49.880
I think inclusion is a great thing.

19:49.880 --> 19:55.920
And even people with disabilities should have, you know, a prominent role in some of these

19:55.920 --> 19:56.920
projects.

19:56.920 --> 19:57.920
Absolutely.

19:57.920 --> 20:02.920
That only brings awareness to those people with disabilities and making that distro even

20:02.920 --> 20:04.560
more suitable for those people.

20:04.560 --> 20:05.560
Yeah.

20:05.560 --> 20:08.800
And I wonder how that, I wonder what that dynamic would, how that would change the dynamic

20:08.800 --> 20:12.920
at events when, you know, it's one of the primary roles of the leadership position.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.400
I wonder how that would change.

20:14.400 --> 20:16.680
Several other interesting folks on the list as well.

20:16.680 --> 20:18.120
And I think we're going to see more show up.

20:18.120 --> 20:22.320
So Debian won't have a leaderless problem.

20:22.320 --> 20:24.520
Now they have an issue of trying to pick just the best one.

20:24.520 --> 20:27.760
I think it's a pretty good, a pretty good spot for them to be in overall.

20:27.760 --> 20:30.080
It's in the campaign time now, right?

20:30.080 --> 20:34.240
And then after, is it another week from now and then there'll be actual voting?

20:34.240 --> 20:38.440
That's my understanding, at least I could have it wrong, but that does track my understanding.

20:38.440 --> 20:39.840
And we'll let you know what happens.

20:39.840 --> 20:44.240
If anything interesting develops, why don't we, just that we only have a few community

20:44.240 --> 20:45.240
news stories.

20:45.240 --> 20:46.240
Let's keep going.

20:46.240 --> 20:51.000
One of the other ones that I just wanted to let everybody know about is that awesome Linux

20:51.000 --> 20:55.800
laptop battery optimization tool, TLP has a new release.

20:55.800 --> 20:59.760
And I'll admit, I kind of thought this project was dormant.

20:59.760 --> 21:03.040
If you're not familiar with TLP, it's a command line advanced Linux power management tool

21:03.040 --> 21:05.880
that helps save battery power for your laptop.

21:05.880 --> 21:09.400
You essentially install it and forget it, at least that's the hope.

21:09.400 --> 21:11.120
TLP is highly configurable though.

21:11.120 --> 21:17.960
So you could go in and modify the Etsy default TLP file to your liking in general.

21:17.960 --> 21:22.800
And there are third party GUIs like TLP UI, which you can install from your local repo

21:22.800 --> 21:25.080
and then manage some of those settings with a GUI.

21:25.080 --> 21:27.440
It really is just sort of install and forget it.

21:27.440 --> 21:31.000
It runs in the background, so it'll detect when you're on AC or battery and you can do

21:31.000 --> 21:34.520
all the normal things like apply different profiles, more optimizations depending on

21:34.520 --> 21:36.920
what power profile that you want.

21:36.920 --> 21:38.120
And it just works.

21:38.120 --> 21:40.440
You can go use other tools like PowerTop.

21:40.440 --> 21:43.400
Don't use its auto tune setting, but you can go use it to go check out and see exactly

21:43.400 --> 21:47.920
what's being tuned and you'll find it all runs very nicely.

21:47.920 --> 21:52.160
And in TLP 1.2, there's even better support for stuff like NVME drives.

21:52.160 --> 21:53.280
I really liked that.

21:53.280 --> 21:56.600
I've already upgraded because we've got those in those ThinkPads.

21:56.600 --> 21:59.600
There's also some neat stuff around Intel GPU frequency limits.

21:59.600 --> 22:02.240
And you could already do this, but they've just integrated it in a nice little way to

22:02.240 --> 22:06.320
do it right in the tool so you can tune whatever minimum or maximum boost frequency setting

22:06.320 --> 22:08.760
depending on if you're on AC or battery.

22:08.760 --> 22:09.760
That's cool.

22:09.760 --> 22:10.760
I like that.

22:10.760 --> 22:13.240
Speaking of ThinkPad, there's a couple other things in there for ThinkPad users too.

22:13.240 --> 22:18.720
Oh yeah, a new native kernel API for battery features that are just specific to ThinkPad.

22:18.720 --> 22:24.160
So you don't need to be running a ThinkPad for this, but if you are, you get a few extras.

22:24.160 --> 22:28.340
I do really appreciate seeing the support for NVME drives.

22:28.340 --> 22:34.240
That is all kinds of fantastic, and it's pretty neat that you can tweak the Intel GPU frequency

22:34.240 --> 22:35.240
stuff.

22:35.240 --> 22:38.520
I didn't really realize that was a thing, and I don't know, it kind of makes me even

22:38.520 --> 22:41.080
happier that I have an Intel card in my ThinkPad.

22:41.080 --> 22:45.680
So TLP is available in just about every Linux distribution under the sun, including Debian

22:45.680 --> 22:50.120
or Ubuntu or Arch or Fedora or probably even openSUSE.

22:50.120 --> 22:55.480
And the new version 1.2 is not available for most of those repositories yet.

22:55.480 --> 22:58.820
It is available though for Arch, surprise, surprise.

22:58.820 --> 23:05.320
And there is a PPA out there for Ubuntu users that is maintained by the TLP developer.

23:05.320 --> 23:09.600
So it's a legit PPA that you can go install if you're on a Ubuntu-based distro.

23:09.600 --> 23:11.040
We'll have a link in the show notes.

23:11.040 --> 23:16.520
Link in the show notes for sure, but you combine something like TLP with PowerTop and you can

23:16.520 --> 23:21.680
really get to a pretty good place in Linux battery performance.

23:21.680 --> 23:26.260
If you have been on a system in the past that you weren't quite sure what was hogging so

23:26.260 --> 23:30.360
much battery life, why was your battery draining so fast, install PowerTop.

23:30.360 --> 23:35.680
And PowerTop will show you what is hitting that CPU, what is waking up your IO, what

23:35.680 --> 23:38.120
is taking all of that power.

23:38.120 --> 23:39.560
That's what PowerTop will tell you.

23:39.560 --> 23:43.960
And then you combine that with something like TLP, which helps tamp some of those things

23:43.960 --> 23:48.160
down when you're in battery mode, and it's intelligent about being on AC power versus

23:48.160 --> 23:55.040
battery power and it's a nice combo that some distributions ship out of the box by default,

23:55.040 --> 23:56.040
but not most.

23:56.040 --> 23:57.640
And it's definitely worth an install.

23:57.640 --> 24:00.680
Not calling it an app pic, Wes, but it's kind of an app pic.

24:00.680 --> 24:01.680
You know what I mean?

24:01.680 --> 24:02.680
It's like a mini app pic.

24:02.680 --> 24:04.240
It's a mini app pic and it deserves it too.

24:04.240 --> 24:07.100
One thing that really impressed me when I was looking at this new release is just the

24:07.100 --> 24:09.220
quality of the documentation the project maintains.

24:09.220 --> 24:13.540
They've got all kinds of nice stuff, a really well filled out FAQ and some practical examples

24:13.540 --> 24:14.540
to get you started.

24:14.540 --> 24:18.600
Man, I don't want to sit here and say, man, this is going to fix all of your battery problems

24:18.600 --> 24:23.440
on Linux, but if you're having battery problems on Linux and you're not using PowerTop and

24:23.440 --> 24:27.440
TLP, do that because it will definitely improve the situation.

24:27.440 --> 24:31.160
And in the case of my ThinkPad, when I have these two different components and if I don't

24:31.160 --> 24:35.400
use Chrome, I stick with Firefox, I can get eight and a half hours of battery life out

24:35.400 --> 24:39.040
of my T480 with the, I think it's like a six cell battery on there.

24:39.040 --> 24:43.920
I'm not quite sure what the battery size is, but eight and a half hours is, that's an all

24:43.920 --> 24:45.240
day battery life for me.

24:45.240 --> 24:50.320
And really it's just a combination of tuning it with PowerTop, using Firefox instead of

24:50.320 --> 24:54.080
Chrome whenever possible, and then TLP underneath it to manage all that stuff.

24:54.080 --> 24:55.080
It's pretty nice.

24:55.080 --> 24:58.320
And Brandon, I know you're a mobile user, have you tried out any of these things?

24:58.320 --> 25:03.760
I learned about TLP maybe two or three years ago and it's been awesome.

25:03.760 --> 25:06.920
And I love, like Wes said, it's a kind of a set it and forget it sort of thing.

25:06.920 --> 25:11.880
So I have it on my main sort of install script and I just don't even think about it, but

25:11.880 --> 25:14.160
the ThinkPad stuff has been really nice.

25:14.160 --> 25:19.480
But one question I have around that is, how is a regular user, you know, someone who's

25:19.480 --> 25:22.760
new to Linux and it's just a desktop user supposed to know about these things that they're

25:22.760 --> 25:23.760
available?

25:23.760 --> 25:27.720
It seems like it took me years to find it really, and it was almost by mistake.

25:27.720 --> 25:30.720
And so how do we spread this stuff around, right?

25:30.720 --> 25:31.720
Yeah, I agree.

25:31.720 --> 25:33.360
Elle, I think you ran into something similar.

25:33.360 --> 25:38.240
Like earlier you were having battery drain issues and I mentioned to go try out PowerTop.

25:38.240 --> 25:39.960
Again it's sort of like, how do you even know about PowerTop?

25:39.960 --> 25:43.600
Well, and one of the things that I ran into that I was joking around the IRC room that

25:43.600 --> 25:48.200
I'm raising my hand is a lot of my battery drain issues were happening when my system

25:48.200 --> 25:49.360
was supposed to be idle.

25:49.360 --> 25:53.000
I'd shut it down or I'd put it in suspend mode and I'd come back and a lot of these

25:53.000 --> 25:57.200
tools I couldn't find the logs to go find out what was happening when I didn't actively

25:57.200 --> 25:58.200
have them running.

25:58.200 --> 26:02.520
Yeah, you know, the battery drain on idle is so frustrating.

26:02.520 --> 26:04.320
That is like, it's like, what are you doing computer?

26:04.320 --> 26:05.320
You're just sitting here.

26:05.320 --> 26:06.880
What is wrong with you?

26:06.880 --> 26:10.520
And if you don't have the logs or you don't have the tools to expose that information,

26:10.520 --> 26:11.640
it's just a black box.

26:11.640 --> 26:12.640
You're trying to fix it.

26:12.640 --> 26:16.120
But I do want to, I want to hit the pause button here because MiniMech is flagging me

26:16.120 --> 26:19.320
and he's saying it's not always all roses.

26:19.320 --> 26:21.080
You've had some problems with TLP, Mini?

26:21.080 --> 26:22.800
Well, I had the same problem.

26:22.800 --> 26:29.140
I was trying to get down my power consumption when in idling state.

26:29.140 --> 26:34.680
So I was tuning like hell and all of a sudden my computer freezed and it didn't wake up

26:34.680 --> 26:40.560
again and I was not knowing why until in the end I found out that I had a firmware bug

26:40.560 --> 26:45.840
in my SSD and once the SSD went to sleep, it didn't wake up again.

26:45.840 --> 26:50.640
So and it was really difficult to do an upgrade for the firmware because you need Windows

26:50.640 --> 26:57.280
to do the firmware upgrade of the SSD and you know what, so you can go too far when

26:57.280 --> 27:00.080
it comes to the configuration with TLP.

27:00.080 --> 27:03.960
Yeah, sounds like if you hit a weird firmware bug, like there's not much you can do about

27:03.960 --> 27:07.760
that and how would you even know until you try something like this?

27:07.760 --> 27:12.480
Well, it took me days, it took me days to find out.

27:12.480 --> 27:16.160
All right, that is a good disclaimer.

27:16.160 --> 27:17.160
That's good to know.

27:17.160 --> 27:22.600
Do you, do you happen to recall what the brand of that SSD was or maybe even the model just

27:22.600 --> 27:24.280
so the audience has a heads up?

27:24.280 --> 27:29.280
I still use it, it's Transcend MST 400.

27:29.280 --> 27:31.440
It's used in a lot of Chromebooks.

27:31.440 --> 27:36.560
You can still buy it and I guess with the new versions, the firmware has been upgraded

27:36.560 --> 27:42.440
so there's no problem now, but when I bought the computer, there was still the old firmware.

27:42.440 --> 27:46.400
Yeah and if you got that old firmware, it only updates through Windows, that's a bit

27:46.400 --> 27:47.400
of a chore.

27:47.400 --> 27:51.000
Back to you Brent, you were wondering why Firefox versus Chrome for me?

27:51.000 --> 27:53.480
Yeah, you mentioned it a few times and I wondered what that's about.

27:53.480 --> 27:59.960
I've noticed that the overall battery drain on Firefox seems to be significantly less

27:59.960 --> 28:00.960
than Chrome.

28:00.960 --> 28:04.640
I don't know what that fully is.

28:04.640 --> 28:08.680
The generous side of me would like to say, well, the Mozilla developers have really optimized

28:08.680 --> 28:13.620
Firefox, but then like the skeptic in me is like, well, that's because Chrome is just

28:13.620 --> 28:18.680
like using like RAM and CPU like a madman to render pages as fast as possible.

28:18.680 --> 28:20.120
I don't know which one's better really.

28:20.120 --> 28:24.800
I don't know, I don't technically know the reason, but I've definitely experienced this.

28:24.800 --> 28:26.620
Now Cheese, I know you wanted to jump in earlier.

28:26.620 --> 28:29.160
Have you had a chance to play with TLP at all?

28:29.160 --> 28:33.880
I haven't had a chance to play with it, but I did want to comment just reading through

28:33.880 --> 28:36.960
the article and some of the documentation.

28:36.960 --> 28:41.680
What's kind of interesting is that you can set up these configurations, but you can set

28:41.680 --> 28:48.000
these up like all the way down to maybe even enabling or disabling integrated radios.

28:48.000 --> 28:55.120
So maybe it could be a software type switch for your Bluetooth and Wi-Fi or whatever,

28:55.120 --> 28:58.920
whenever you're at a conference or someplace you don't feel comfortable.

28:58.920 --> 29:02.660
You could act as that software kind of switch that you see on some of these hardware devices

29:02.660 --> 29:05.760
that are available and or coming down the pipeline.

29:05.760 --> 29:09.320
You know, now you say that, man, I could see like having like conference mode TLP config

29:09.320 --> 29:15.160
where it just shuts off all the radios, just go dark and save battery power while you're

29:15.160 --> 29:16.160
at it.

29:16.160 --> 29:17.160
I like that.

29:17.160 --> 29:20.400
If you're out there and you've got a good config or you've got a war story like Mini

29:20.400 --> 29:25.720
Mac did Linux, unplug dot com slash contact, send it in and let us know.

29:25.720 --> 29:31.220
Now this next story, this is a hard one because it depends on your bias.

29:31.220 --> 29:34.000
When you read this story, you're either going to read it two different ways.

29:34.000 --> 29:38.120
I mean, it's it's all about money, really.

29:38.120 --> 29:45.600
What we have now is a company that is quasi independent, calling themselves fully independent.

29:45.600 --> 29:48.860
And I'm talking about your good friends over at SUSE.

29:48.860 --> 29:55.800
They have announced that they are once again an independent company that is owned by an

29:55.800 --> 29:56.800
investment firm.

29:56.800 --> 29:58.080
I'm not quite sure on that.

29:58.080 --> 30:03.600
I kind of depends on your on your definition of independent and of being owned by a private

30:03.600 --> 30:05.760
equity investor counts as independent.

30:05.760 --> 30:06.760
Yeah.

30:06.760 --> 30:10.440
And I mean, as long as we're just going to play the technicality game to us like they're

30:10.440 --> 30:12.400
they're big promotions all over their blog.

30:12.400 --> 30:13.400
It's in every press release.

30:13.400 --> 30:17.000
They are now the largest independent open source company.

30:17.000 --> 30:20.760
The only problem with that, I mean, again, we're just playing technicalities here, is

30:20.760 --> 30:24.240
the Red Hat IBM acquisition isn't done yet.

30:24.240 --> 30:27.880
So technically, Red Hat's still the largest independent open source company.

30:27.880 --> 30:32.240
Well, that's what you get for reading blog posts and PR articles, Chris.

30:32.240 --> 30:33.240
That's so true.

30:33.240 --> 30:34.240
That is so true.

30:34.240 --> 30:36.280
And they've gone through a few hands over the years.

30:36.280 --> 30:37.280
Oh, yeah.

30:37.280 --> 30:42.480
I mean, I can't think of that many other companies that have kind of been passed around so much.

30:42.480 --> 30:47.640
Way back when they were first acquired by Novell, oh, yes, Novell in 2004.

30:47.640 --> 30:52.760
And then, okay, that stuck around for a little while in 2010, AttachMate bought up Novell,

30:52.760 --> 30:58.000
which then a little less time now Micro Focus in 2014 bought AttachMate.

30:58.000 --> 31:01.160
At that point, things got a little bit better for Zeus, because they were turned into an

31:01.160 --> 31:02.820
independent division.

31:02.820 --> 31:07.400
But then, well, just last year in 2018, they were sold to EQT.

31:07.400 --> 31:08.400
Right.

31:08.400 --> 31:15.240
And I believe they are still the primary owner, EQT is what's called a, quote, growth investor.

31:15.240 --> 31:20.480
So it could be that Sousa is an independent corporation that is getting growth investment

31:20.480 --> 31:21.480
from EQT.

31:21.480 --> 31:24.800
So they're not actually owned so much by EQT.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.760
But independent is still debatable.

31:26.760 --> 31:30.680
Oh, Zeus, we'll see what this means and if it actually like, there has been some replacements

31:30.680 --> 31:32.520
of various leadership positions.

31:32.520 --> 31:35.400
So perhaps that will have long term outcomes for the company.

31:35.400 --> 31:36.800
But only time will tell.

31:36.800 --> 31:37.800
Yeah.

31:37.800 --> 31:41.320
So everybody bear in mind, this doesn't really change anything for open Sousa, which is the

31:41.320 --> 31:46.160
distribution we often talk a lot more about Sousa here is this is the enterprise product.

31:46.160 --> 31:50.720
This is the product they're trying to position as a solid competitor to Red Hat Enterprise

31:50.720 --> 31:51.720
Linux.

31:51.720 --> 31:56.200
Hence, this now renewed focus on being an independent open source company.

31:56.200 --> 32:00.560
It's kind of it's a reverse jab saying we're not owned by IBM, but you got to ask yourself

32:00.560 --> 32:06.200
like you look at the market and you look at IBM's acquisition of Red Hat.

32:06.200 --> 32:10.640
It does kind of and this is my opinion, but to me, it seems like it's only a matter of

32:10.640 --> 32:14.360
time until somebody else comes along and buys Zeus.

32:14.360 --> 32:18.480
Just like I would imagine that if Canonical went public or if Canonical wasn't in its

32:18.480 --> 32:22.480
current financial raising stage, it would likely get bought up too.

32:22.480 --> 32:24.960
It's just the the reality of the marketplace right now.

32:24.960 --> 32:28.560
Yeah, it does say something about the value proposition of some of these companies.

32:28.560 --> 32:32.640
Well, we'll see how long we can hold out on if anything actually happens.

32:32.640 --> 32:36.560
And I am surprised to see it is popular in some embedded spaces.

32:36.560 --> 32:40.560
I've seen it of the Linux I see at like various point of sale machines.

32:40.560 --> 32:42.040
I think Zeus is still the most common.

32:42.040 --> 32:43.040
Yeah.

32:43.040 --> 32:48.440
And they had they do have a pretty legitimate and large vendor ecosystem around them.

32:48.440 --> 32:51.680
Like that's when you when you've been around for like twenty five years like they have

32:51.680 --> 32:57.960
you build out like deep industry relationships and those are things they can still leverage

32:57.960 --> 33:00.160
and maybe even more so now.

33:00.160 --> 33:03.920
So I think at the end of the day, the takeaway from the story is Zeus is in a better spot

33:03.920 --> 33:05.780
than they have been in a long time.

33:05.780 --> 33:10.900
They're independent again and they've got the deep pockets of EQT should they need it.

33:10.900 --> 33:13.440
That's actually a pretty competitive spot for them to be in.

33:13.440 --> 33:20.440
I wonder how how Zeus being passed around like that has affected their community and

33:20.440 --> 33:21.440
their community involvement.

33:21.440 --> 33:26.720
I mean, if you look at, say, the community around Ubuntu or something like that, or even

33:26.720 --> 33:33.560
the Red Hat Centaur community, it just seems more vibrant, maybe.

33:33.560 --> 33:34.560
I do agree.

33:34.560 --> 33:35.560
It seems larger.

33:35.560 --> 33:43.080
However, I feel like open Sousa being its own separate thing has insulated a lot of

33:43.080 --> 33:50.200
the enthusiast community from these changes at Sousa, like as an open Sousa user.

33:50.200 --> 33:53.520
It's almost always been sort of the footnote of all of these stories.

33:53.520 --> 33:58.600
Oh, by the way, if you use open Sousa, this doesn't affect you like that's been the footnote

33:58.600 --> 34:00.400
for all of these purchases so far.

34:00.400 --> 34:05.600
And in a way, that's sort of been like a buffer between all of the corporate shenanigans

34:05.600 --> 34:08.920
and the end enthusiast users who are using the distribution.

34:08.920 --> 34:11.760
I think it's I mean, you're right.

34:11.760 --> 34:15.380
It is hard to say if there's been a cost and their community doesn't seem to be as large

34:15.380 --> 34:20.680
as some of the other distributions, but it's still a pretty large, healthy community overall

34:20.680 --> 34:27.440
and taken in totality, and it's survived a lot of change of hands, which is kind of impressive.

34:27.440 --> 34:34.120
Oh, yeah, absolutely impressive that they're able to forge along, you know, with I wouldn't

34:34.120 --> 34:40.640
I wouldn't say that it's turmoil, but I remember way back in 2004, whenever the first acquisition

34:40.640 --> 34:45.680
happened and thinking that was going to be a real growing point for them.

34:45.680 --> 34:46.960
Their marketing is wonderful.

34:46.960 --> 34:52.160
They do their but sometimes I'm curious if that marketing is directed where it should

34:52.160 --> 34:53.160
be.

34:53.160 --> 34:57.600
You mean YouTube videos instead of something more directly beneficial and contributing

34:57.600 --> 34:58.600
to the community?

34:58.600 --> 35:02.720
Yeah, I mean, given given a little something more back to the community, if you're going

35:02.720 --> 35:08.120
to spend that kind of money, I think it could better be better spent on other things, other

35:08.120 --> 35:15.280
projects and just opening up and accepting it with open arms, the community and what

35:15.280 --> 35:16.800
what they want to see.

35:16.800 --> 35:17.800
People do love them, though.

35:17.800 --> 35:19.360
They love those videos.

35:19.360 --> 35:20.720
I want to just I didn't do it earlier.

35:20.720 --> 35:25.000
I want to mention we've got Brent in the virtual lug today, Bruce Cheese, who you're just hearing

35:25.000 --> 35:28.840
from Els in their mini mech and Thor Thor Hop.

35:28.840 --> 35:29.840
Hello, Mr. Thor.

35:29.840 --> 35:31.440
Nice to have you join us.

35:31.440 --> 35:32.440
That's that's new.

35:32.440 --> 35:36.360
I think we've had Thor in there before.

35:36.360 --> 35:43.400
And Cheese is hard at work right now on refreshing the look of our logos for the shows.

35:43.400 --> 35:46.720
And man, I am so excited by this process, Wes.

35:46.720 --> 35:47.720
It's awesome.

35:47.720 --> 35:48.720
Yeah.

35:48.720 --> 35:49.720
Yeah.

35:49.720 --> 35:50.720
And I don't know, man.

35:50.720 --> 35:51.720
I just cheese.

35:51.720 --> 35:55.840
I just we're not going to we're not going to say much yet because it's still early days.

35:55.840 --> 35:58.320
It's yeah, we don't want to spoil nothing.

35:58.320 --> 36:03.440
But we've got we got a new fresh look that cheese is hard at work on right now.

36:03.440 --> 36:09.760
And we've had some great, great input from the Linux Academy design team, too.

36:09.760 --> 36:12.640
And I'm just really happy with the way things are going.

36:12.640 --> 36:17.760
And if this is a big if but if everything kind of syncs up and lines up, our current

36:17.760 --> 36:25.440
plans and intentions are to reveal the new look, the new logos, new swag at Linux Fest

36:25.440 --> 36:26.960
Northwest this year.

36:26.960 --> 36:28.840
Yeah, that deserves a bell.

36:28.840 --> 36:30.780
It's a big undertaking.

36:30.780 --> 36:32.660
There's a lot of work that's already been done.

36:32.660 --> 36:34.920
There's a lot of work that's still going into it.

36:34.920 --> 36:40.280
And just the scope and scale of this is a I think is pretty dramatic.

36:40.280 --> 36:41.560
Yeah, it's every show.

36:41.560 --> 36:45.140
Plus all the different iterations you have for social media and for the websites and

36:45.140 --> 36:47.260
for the MP3 badges and all these.

36:47.260 --> 36:50.480
There's hundreds of different ways we use the logo that people don't even really realize

36:50.480 --> 36:53.240
because, you know, just all part of what we do.

36:53.240 --> 37:00.720
And I so many, so many times have I wished we've had the resources to clean these up

37:00.720 --> 37:02.200
and update them over the years.

37:02.200 --> 37:04.820
So just super excited to have a here cheese working on that.

37:04.820 --> 37:07.480
So I know we can't say much because it's early days.

37:07.480 --> 37:12.480
Yeah, I will say that I think people will enjoy a kind of unified look.

37:12.480 --> 37:13.480
Mm hmm.

37:13.480 --> 37:17.680
Yeah, there'll be some familiarity, but it'll be a nice, clean, unified look across everything.

37:17.680 --> 37:24.240
Just like our new friends over at the Mate desktop, version 1.2.0 is out this week.

37:24.240 --> 37:30.840
There's the new mate panel with a crazy ton of rework, especially for Wayland support.

37:30.840 --> 37:37.200
And the number one, absolutely no doubt about it, most important feature, Wanda the fish

37:37.200 --> 37:42.120
has now been updated to work properly on high DPI displays.

37:42.120 --> 37:43.120
It's about time.

37:43.120 --> 37:44.120
I know.

37:44.120 --> 37:45.120
And never fear, Wes.

37:45.120 --> 37:49.800
It's still pixelated on purpose because Wanda the fish is supposed to be pixelated.

37:49.800 --> 37:51.640
I actually don't know who Wanda is.

37:51.640 --> 37:52.640
I haven't met Wanda yet.

37:52.640 --> 37:53.640
Could someone?

37:53.640 --> 37:54.840
You got to go Google Wanda the fish.

37:54.840 --> 37:55.840
You got to do it.

37:55.840 --> 38:00.200
Yeah, it's a it's maybe one of the the best panel plugins, extensions, whatever you want

38:00.200 --> 38:03.000
to call it ever.

38:03.000 --> 38:07.280
So you know, Nome extensions really have a legacy going back to Nome too, where you could

38:07.280 --> 38:12.800
put these little applets up in the up in the toolbar, little eyes to follow your mouse

38:12.800 --> 38:13.800
around, whatever.

38:13.800 --> 38:14.800
Yep.

38:14.800 --> 38:15.920
X eyes was another one.

38:15.920 --> 38:20.480
And so Wanda the fish, you could go and you go search for one of the fish, Nome or Mate,

38:20.480 --> 38:23.840
and you'll see what I'm talking about.

38:23.840 --> 38:27.360
I don't know why anybody wants to spend CPU cycles on something like that.

38:27.360 --> 38:31.400
And yet at the same time, I love that it's let's see, it's not the first feature, but

38:31.400 --> 38:35.000
it is one to it's the fourth feature they list.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
This is what I noticed.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.480
All the most important stuff is buried at the bottom.

38:38.480 --> 38:42.760
Things like improving stability by closing memory leaks and fixing build warnings, removing

38:42.760 --> 38:46.480
deprecated code, a whole bunch of updated documentation.

38:46.480 --> 38:51.440
And they put in a bunch of work to get their CI better, having clean builds on major distros.

38:51.440 --> 38:52.440
That's huge.

38:52.440 --> 38:53.440
And it's at the bottom.

38:53.440 --> 38:58.240
I know, like that's going to improve every future release from here on out.

38:58.240 --> 38:59.560
Like that's how big that feature is.

38:59.560 --> 39:00.560
But it's on the bottom.

39:00.560 --> 39:03.680
But one to the fish at the top, man.

39:03.680 --> 39:08.200
And it's below the calculator now supports 15 characters of accuracy, which is great.

39:08.200 --> 39:10.000
And I like that a lot personally.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
But reorder that.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
Yeah.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
Yeah.

39:13.000 --> 39:17.480
It is nice to see that GTK cleanup and that Wayland support coming along.

39:17.480 --> 39:25.000
There's something that just tickles me about this classic old style interface paradigm

39:25.000 --> 39:30.600
that is modern, high DPI, GTK three, ready to go, running on Wayland.

39:30.600 --> 39:32.200
Like it just tickles me.

39:32.200 --> 39:34.280
It just really does.

39:34.280 --> 39:37.880
I want to mention a story that's a little frustrating right now.

39:37.880 --> 39:40.680
And this is our one of our last ones for the week.

39:40.680 --> 39:42.160
And it's KD Connect.

39:42.160 --> 39:43.280
Just such a great tool.

39:43.280 --> 39:44.640
I've met Albert.

39:44.640 --> 39:48.480
He is a fantastic, talented developer.

39:48.480 --> 39:54.880
And he tweeted today that Google has yanked KD Connect, the Android side that you need

39:54.880 --> 39:57.040
to connect to your plasma desktop.

39:57.040 --> 40:03.640
They've yanked it from the Play Store on grounds of violation of a new policy for apps that

40:03.640 --> 40:06.120
access your SMS.

40:06.120 --> 40:14.320
Now this policy does have an explicit exception for companion apps like many others.

40:14.320 --> 40:17.880
But KD Connect, for whatever reason, was not granted that explicit permission.

40:17.880 --> 40:22.040
Now those scammer apps that are stealing your SMS contacts and uploading those to Chinese

40:22.040 --> 40:25.560
servers, still good to go.

40:25.560 --> 40:27.600
It has been resubmitted to the Play Store, right?

40:27.600 --> 40:28.960
Yeah, I believe so.

40:28.960 --> 40:32.400
It's just so frustrating though, because this is one of my favorite applications.

40:32.400 --> 40:36.200
And I am one of the things I am the first thing to install whenever I reinstall my Android

40:36.200 --> 40:37.200
phone.

40:37.200 --> 40:41.200
Yeah, and it had to get resubmitted without the SMS reading support.

40:41.200 --> 40:42.200
Yeah, that's it.

40:42.200 --> 40:46.140
They don't have that capability anymore, which I have other means around that, but is kind

40:46.140 --> 40:50.780
of one of the price features of the application, at least for users still stuck on SMS.

40:50.780 --> 40:57.020
It's an obvious, obvious sort of failure on the Play Store side, because this app has

40:57.020 --> 41:01.920
legitimate use for this data, and it's been using something that has been allowed up until

41:01.920 --> 41:02.920
this point.

41:02.920 --> 41:07.080
And then where it really falls down, though, is there's really no humans he can talk to.

41:07.080 --> 41:11.520
Yeah, and I think as Brent points out, and he can chime in more, but there are competitive

41:11.520 --> 41:12.520
marketplaces.

41:12.520 --> 41:16.160
So if the Play Store wants to be seen as a place to get safe, legitimate software, they're

41:16.160 --> 41:18.160
doing exactly all the wrong things.

41:18.160 --> 41:19.440
So maybe we should be using F-Droid.

41:19.440 --> 41:20.440
Yeah.

41:20.440 --> 41:21.440
That's probably it, right, Brent?

41:21.440 --> 41:24.760
I mean, this is the opportunity for people to try something different.

41:24.760 --> 41:25.760
Yeah, so true.

41:25.760 --> 41:31.000
I've been using F-Droid for a few years, just as it started out as a bit of an experiment,

41:31.000 --> 41:32.200
just to see, oh, what's in there?

41:32.200 --> 41:35.720
But it's really come into its own in the last year.

41:35.720 --> 41:37.280
So I use it exclusively, actually.

41:37.280 --> 41:42.040
I just checked my phone since the intro where you mentioned KD Connect, and almost all of

41:42.040 --> 41:44.520
the apps I use daily are from F-Droid.

41:44.520 --> 41:50.040
And so if anybody doesn't know about F-Droid, it's just basically a repository for open

41:50.040 --> 41:52.600
source focused apps that you can get on Android.

41:52.600 --> 41:56.920
So you don't need any crazy logins or permissions to install it.

41:56.920 --> 42:00.360
You can go get it at f-droid.org.

42:00.360 --> 42:03.040
But for KD Connect, it's on there.

42:03.040 --> 42:04.920
They're updating it all the time.

42:04.920 --> 42:08.440
And I was really sad to hear what the news was here on KD Connect, but to hear from me

42:08.440 --> 42:12.920
at least that it was pulled from the Play Store doesn't really affect me any.

42:12.920 --> 42:18.280
So I'd encourage anybody who is interested in Linux Unplugged, they'd probably love F-Droid

42:18.280 --> 42:19.280
if you're not in it already.

42:19.280 --> 42:21.440
Yeah, you could always use both too.

42:21.440 --> 42:23.600
They're not mutually exclusive either.

42:23.600 --> 42:26.840
So if there's some things in the Play Store, you could still do that.

42:26.840 --> 42:29.760
Or you might be able to get rid of the Play Store depending on what you really need and

42:29.760 --> 42:30.760
just stick with F-Droid.

42:30.760 --> 42:33.280
Is that what you do or are you mixing it up, Brent?

42:33.280 --> 42:37.920
Well, I've been mixing it up now because I have thought that I needed to.

42:37.920 --> 42:42.080
And one of the last apps that I thought I needed to do that with was Signal Messenger,

42:42.080 --> 42:47.080
which I use quite a bit, which I wonder if that got pulled too because it definitely

42:47.080 --> 42:48.360
has access to your SMS.

42:48.360 --> 42:50.880
But you mentioned there were some exclusions.

42:50.880 --> 42:57.660
But I noticed that that was the last app and you can just get it from their own website.

42:57.660 --> 43:03.840
So I just checked and none of the Play Store apps I'm actually using on a daily basis.

43:03.840 --> 43:05.760
It's mostly the Cruft that comes with the phone.

43:05.760 --> 43:10.240
So I would say I'd be totally fine with running F-Droid 100% of the time now.

43:10.240 --> 43:14.480
There's been a huge increase in the amount of usable apps in there and the quality of

43:14.480 --> 43:15.480
them.

43:15.480 --> 43:16.480
So it's been great.

43:16.480 --> 43:17.480
That's nice.

43:17.480 --> 43:21.320
That's really good to hear because it's probably been a year since I've checked it out.

43:21.320 --> 43:26.160
So I think I will load it up on my Pixel and I will give it another go because I'm a big,

43:26.160 --> 43:27.160
big fan of KDE Connect.

43:27.160 --> 43:31.320
And I think this is the killer app right there to really make me give it another try.

43:31.320 --> 43:36.700
You might have some problems, but I'm not sure with the Nome experience.

43:36.700 --> 43:41.400
But on KDE, the KDE Connect just gets better and better and better and better every single

43:41.400 --> 43:42.400
month.

43:42.400 --> 43:43.400
So the features are amazing.

43:43.400 --> 43:44.400
There you go.

43:44.400 --> 43:46.600
There's your unplugged app pick again.

43:46.600 --> 43:49.800
Not quite an app pick, but it is a bit of an app pick, F-Droid.

43:49.800 --> 43:52.640
We're knocking out of the park, team.

43:52.640 --> 43:55.000
I am really happy to see that.

43:55.000 --> 43:58.440
And I hope that Google works with the KDE Connect folks.

43:58.440 --> 44:02.120
The real issue is, and their main complaint has been, we just haven't been able to talk

44:02.120 --> 44:03.120
to anybody.

44:03.120 --> 44:07.680
We just want to explain what our version of the story is and see if you'll work with us.

44:07.680 --> 44:09.600
But we don't even have that opportunity.

44:09.600 --> 44:12.200
And that's the classic complaint about Google, right?

44:12.200 --> 44:15.200
When their machines do it correctly, they're kind of great and streamlined.

44:15.200 --> 44:19.080
But when there's any kind of kink in the system that you need a human to resolve, there are

44:19.080 --> 44:20.080
no humans around.

44:20.080 --> 44:22.760
I'm sure the game stream service, though, that's going to be great.

44:22.760 --> 44:24.240
All right.

44:24.240 --> 44:27.080
Well, I want to talk about eBPF.

44:27.080 --> 44:28.940
This don't call it eBPF.

44:28.940 --> 44:29.940
Just call it BPF.

44:29.940 --> 44:32.380
No, it's not your Berkeley Pack of filter anymore.

44:32.380 --> 44:37.040
It's something much, much cooler built into the Linux kernel that kernel developers and

44:37.040 --> 44:42.760
performance engineers like Brandon Gregg at Netflix are absolutely excited about.

44:42.760 --> 44:47.640
So just a brief moment of housekeeping.

44:47.640 --> 44:51.640
There's really only one thing I want to tell you about this week, and that is Linux Fest

44:51.640 --> 44:54.600
Northwest 2019 coming very soon.

44:54.600 --> 44:56.400
And we've set up a telegram group.

44:56.400 --> 45:02.360
Go to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Linux Fest, and you can get in on our Linux Fest

45:02.360 --> 45:04.360
Northwest community telegram group.

45:04.360 --> 45:10.460
And in fact, I want to extend this invitation to even those of you who can't make it to

45:10.460 --> 45:11.460
Linux Fest.

45:11.460 --> 45:18.520
We'll likely be using this URL for Texas Linux Fest and other fests that go on around the

45:18.520 --> 45:21.080
country or the world.

45:21.080 --> 45:26.120
So I encourage you to join if you want to contribute positively to the conversation.

45:26.120 --> 45:31.080
And the other reason is, as you heard, we're going to be updating the show logos and the

45:31.080 --> 45:32.320
network logo.

45:32.320 --> 45:37.060
So I thought one thing that might be kind of cool to do is do a big old series of giveaways

45:37.060 --> 45:41.960
in that telegram group of the old retro sticker logos while we still got them.

45:41.960 --> 45:43.560
Did you say retro swag?

45:43.560 --> 45:44.560
Yeah, man.

45:44.560 --> 45:49.680
Well, I mean, it's current swag now, but it's soon to be retro.

45:49.680 --> 45:50.680
Yeah.

45:50.680 --> 45:54.520
So we'll start doing that as Linux Fest Northwest gets closer for folks in that room.

45:54.520 --> 45:56.800
And I don't know, we're kind of kicking around.

45:56.800 --> 46:00.920
Like if you show up at our booth at Linux Fest and you show that you're in our telegram

46:00.920 --> 46:03.920
group, maybe we might have a little something extra for you.

46:03.920 --> 46:06.680
And it's not a bad place to go anyways, because that's where we coordinate things like the

46:06.680 --> 46:13.600
parking lot barbecue, which I got to say, Wes, Emma is getting me so hyped.

46:13.600 --> 46:17.760
Emma from System76 and I are chatting now like on a daily basis about like, hey, what

46:17.760 --> 46:18.760
about this?

46:18.760 --> 46:19.760
Hey, do you think we could do this?

46:19.760 --> 46:22.200
Like today we were discussing the table situation, you know.

46:22.200 --> 46:26.340
She is a great organizer and really knows how to throw a fantastic party.

46:26.340 --> 46:29.760
So I'm sure it's going to be even bigger and better than last year, which was already amazing.

46:29.760 --> 46:34.520
I feel like we should get her on here sometime and have her maybe a week or two before and

46:34.520 --> 46:37.220
have her throw her hype game out there for it.

46:37.220 --> 46:38.320
That is a great idea.

46:38.320 --> 46:39.960
I will suggest that to her.

46:39.960 --> 46:45.640
And really, I should mention, make sure on air that System76 is providing a ton of the

46:45.640 --> 46:50.220
food and drink to everybody is bringing something, but they're bringing, I would say, the bulk

46:50.220 --> 46:51.640
of the meat.

46:51.640 --> 46:52.720
And that's not cheap.

46:52.720 --> 46:58.200
And I just I just it's so cool because it's not necessarily like going to change a thousand

46:58.200 --> 47:02.320
lives, but it might make, you know, maybe like, you know, 50 to 100 people really happy

47:02.320 --> 47:04.900
and they're still invested in doing that.

47:04.900 --> 47:07.620
And I'm that's one of the reasons I'm in L.A. right now.

47:07.620 --> 47:12.840
I'm bringing the RV back up from Texas to get it up to Bellingham for Linux Fest Northwest.

47:12.840 --> 47:18.540
So like quite literally, the wheels are in motion to make this a huge event.

47:18.540 --> 47:22.880
We have all of the details at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

47:22.880 --> 47:25.420
That's where the barbecue meetup information is at.

47:25.420 --> 47:29.300
And that telegram group, which we'll probably use for future Linux Fest, too.

47:29.300 --> 47:33.440
But right now it's for Linux Fest Northwest, that's at Jupiter Broadcasting dot com slash

47:33.440 --> 47:34.440
Linux Fest.

47:34.440 --> 47:37.860
And that is where I'll be giving away the soon to be retro stickers.

47:37.860 --> 47:41.340
So if you want to get in on that or maybe a little extra swag at the booth, you go get

47:41.340 --> 47:47.040
in that telegram group, you hang out, contribute positively to the conversation and we'll all

47:47.040 --> 47:48.040
have a great time.

47:48.040 --> 47:49.040
All right.

47:49.040 --> 47:50.040
That's it.

47:50.040 --> 47:54.420
Just a real quick little short housekeeping this week, because really, I want to hear

47:54.420 --> 47:55.420
about EBPF.

47:55.420 --> 48:02.900
I'm I'm not often like starstruck when I see people, but Brandon Gregg, he's got this he's

48:02.900 --> 48:05.060
got this amazing look about him.

48:05.060 --> 48:09.260
It's he's got a coiff of hair that looks like it's always being blown in the wind.

48:09.260 --> 48:10.260
But there is no wind.

48:10.260 --> 48:11.700
You're like, well, how does this work?

48:11.700 --> 48:12.700
Right.

48:12.700 --> 48:13.700
And and what did you say, Wes?

48:13.700 --> 48:17.620
Like it makes it look like he's always having a good time the way I mean, giving a talk

48:17.620 --> 48:23.000
in at scale or, you know, fighting performance problems in production, Netflix or surfing

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
on a beach.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.580
I imagine he looks exactly the same.

48:26.580 --> 48:27.580
That's exactly it.

48:27.580 --> 48:29.540
That is the perfect way to describe his look.

48:29.540 --> 48:36.940
He's got you know, he had this great ensemble, a pink shirt, a super bright red belt and

48:36.940 --> 48:40.260
some red pants and just really, really caught the eye.

48:40.260 --> 48:42.700
And we talked about this a little bit last week.

48:42.700 --> 48:50.360
He did some incredible takedowns of Minecraft performance using EBPF, which I think I'm

48:50.360 --> 48:51.360
doing it a disservice.

48:51.360 --> 48:55.220
So I'm about to hand it over to you, but I think maybe the closest parallel is it has

48:55.220 --> 49:00.020
a lot of same benefits a tool like D-Trace might have, which has a lot of hype around

49:00.020 --> 49:01.020
it.

49:01.020 --> 49:02.020
Yeah, exactly.

49:02.020 --> 49:05.220
And it can be a little confusing because BPF is fundamentally a virtual machine.

49:05.220 --> 49:08.460
It's a bytecode that runs on a virtual machine inside the kernel.

49:08.460 --> 49:10.980
And so it has a huge number of use cases.

49:10.980 --> 49:16.100
BPF is obviously Berkeley packet filter and came from the use case of filtering packets.

49:16.100 --> 49:18.980
That's not what we're talking about today and not really what what Brendan's doing.

49:18.980 --> 49:23.120
He's talking about tracing and one of the new tools on the block that is very similar

49:23.120 --> 49:28.620
to D-Trace in some aspects is BPF trace, which is kind of a command line playing around handy

49:28.620 --> 49:33.580
one line scripting utility whose command language is modeled after D-Trace.

49:33.580 --> 49:34.580
It kind of looks like awk.

49:34.580 --> 49:38.260
So you might be wondering, OK, what does BPF trace do?

49:38.260 --> 49:42.700
Well, it allows you to write small programs that execute whenever an event occurs.

49:42.700 --> 49:43.700
All right.

49:43.700 --> 49:45.220
That's not that's not really a useful explanation.

49:45.220 --> 49:46.220
I know.

49:46.220 --> 49:47.220
What's an event?

49:47.220 --> 49:51.260
Is it a system call, a function call or even something that happens inside a function call

49:51.260 --> 49:55.780
like 50 milliseconds has elapsed since the last time something happened or a page fault

49:55.780 --> 49:57.660
occurred?

49:57.660 --> 50:01.460
Once you get an event, this tooling lets you do something right like log something, compile

50:01.460 --> 50:05.500
statistics about what's happening and you have access to interesting information here

50:05.500 --> 50:10.380
like the PID, stack trace, time, all the arguments on the call stack, the return value, all these

50:10.380 --> 50:14.860
many little details that you might want to understand how your program is really running.

50:14.860 --> 50:20.700
Now do I get those details because the BPF virtual machine is living in the kernel so

50:20.700 --> 50:26.420
it it can learn what the kernel knows or I guess all of that sounds good.

50:26.420 --> 50:30.380
But why being a virtual machine in the kernel, why is that the important part?

50:30.380 --> 50:31.380
We're going to get into that.

50:31.380 --> 50:35.020
And basically it's it's for performance reasons because you don't have to incur a context

50:35.020 --> 50:38.580
switch or try to go dump a bunch of data from kernel memory into user space.

50:38.580 --> 50:42.340
Instead, you can compile statistics inside the kernel.

50:42.340 --> 50:45.900
Once you've computed those, just do one copy at the end of the final computed value instead

50:45.900 --> 50:50.540
of having to share all the intermediate data, which as Brendan will talk about, sometimes

50:50.540 --> 50:53.320
that can be like gigabytes a second.

50:53.320 --> 50:56.780
We should also note here that we're talking about cool tools that you can use now and

50:56.780 --> 51:00.460
that is one of the big takeaways is that this stuff is has been around for a little while,

51:00.460 --> 51:01.460
but it's matured.

51:01.460 --> 51:05.100
And finally, most distros are going to have kernels and and possibly even packages for

51:05.100 --> 51:06.180
you to use.

51:06.180 --> 51:07.860
So these tools exist.

51:07.860 --> 51:10.980
But to really understand some of the motivation and background, I thought we should talk about

51:10.980 --> 51:14.900
the history and we can't not talk about detrace.

51:14.900 --> 51:17.540
I mean, you already brought it up, Chris.

51:17.540 --> 51:22.860
And detrace is a full system dynamic tracing framework originally developed by Sun.

51:22.860 --> 51:25.820
And dynamic tracing is all those things we've just talked about.

51:25.820 --> 51:28.780
And then the dynamic part is usually you don't have to recompile, right?

51:28.780 --> 51:33.340
You don't have to have worked with the developers to go pick points that you want to specifically

51:33.340 --> 51:34.340
trace.

51:34.340 --> 51:37.860
On the fly, you can add new trace points so that you can understand what's actually happening

51:37.860 --> 51:39.500
on your production systems.

51:39.500 --> 51:42.980
And this is a huge capability and Linux hasn't had it.

51:42.980 --> 51:43.980
Yeah.

51:43.980 --> 51:48.420
And this is critical for very high performance workloads where you need to understand what

51:48.420 --> 51:53.500
components are getting slowed down at what times and what is the root cause.

51:53.500 --> 51:58.940
And imagine a Netflix scenario, for example, where you're serving up streaming video to

51:58.940 --> 52:07.980
millions of people, a few seconds, even a second of delay times a million is unacceptable.

52:07.980 --> 52:13.860
And so the requirements and the pressure for extremely high performance applications sort

52:13.860 --> 52:18.700
of necessitate this tracing ability where it is exactly what the word implies.

52:18.700 --> 52:23.460
You can trace the steps that the application went through, what resources it accessed and

52:23.460 --> 52:28.940
use that to sort of walk back a story of what it was doing and where it slowed down.

52:28.940 --> 52:33.460
Now you may wonder, okay, detrace was actually put under, relicensed under the GPL just last

52:33.460 --> 52:35.620
year in 2018.

52:35.620 --> 52:36.620
Shouldn't we just be using that?

52:36.620 --> 52:38.880
Why is Linux reinventing the wheel here?

52:38.880 --> 52:43.420
But as you'll see, eBBF is nice, both because it has a, you know, this general virtual machine

52:43.420 --> 52:47.060
that is already used for other features in the kernel, and so is a simplification and

52:47.060 --> 52:50.000
a unification of code paths in that way.

52:50.000 --> 52:53.500
But also, in some ways, it's more powerful.

52:53.500 --> 52:57.280
Before we get into that, though, let's try to sympathize because for a long time, Brendan

52:57.280 --> 52:58.660
was the expert on detrace, right?

52:58.660 --> 53:02.300
He made all kinds of great tooling around it, spent a lot of time working at Sun on

53:02.300 --> 53:04.040
these systems.

53:04.040 --> 53:09.660
And then he went to work at Netflix on Linux, where he didn't have any of these tooling.

53:09.660 --> 53:14.840
In fact, I think he was a bit of I don't think a Linux new, but it wasn't his daily driver.

53:14.840 --> 53:17.040
And he, like you said, is a big fan of detrace.

53:17.040 --> 53:21.120
And the reason why I want to underscore that is detrace has become one of those projects

53:21.120 --> 53:22.760
that has its fans.

53:22.760 --> 53:27.000
And it becomes a holy war when you start talking about different methods of tracing.

53:27.000 --> 53:30.240
And if it's not detrace, it's garbage to some people.

53:30.240 --> 53:35.720
And I'm not saying Brandon was one of those types of characters, but he was familiar with

53:35.720 --> 53:36.720
that camp.

53:36.720 --> 53:39.840
And he was kind of a detrace fan.

53:39.840 --> 53:45.280
And to see him make this move and appreciate what BPF can do and how you can use it.

53:45.280 --> 53:50.380
Not only is that fascinating, but the journey of joining Netflix that got him here is also

53:50.380 --> 53:51.380
an incredible story.

53:51.380 --> 53:52.380
Yeah.

53:52.380 --> 53:53.380
Let's let him tell a little bit more of it.

53:53.380 --> 53:54.380
OK.

53:54.380 --> 53:55.380
Thanks for choosing this talk.

53:55.380 --> 53:56.380
My name is Brendan Gregg.

53:56.380 --> 53:59.000
I am a senior performance architect at Netflix.

53:59.000 --> 54:03.360
And as of tomorrow, I'll have been at Netflix for five years.

54:03.360 --> 54:04.360
Time flies.

54:04.360 --> 54:09.080
That means I'll have worked on Linux full time for five years.

54:09.080 --> 54:16.100
When I came to Netflix, I was a detrace expert and performance analyst.

54:16.100 --> 54:21.800
And coming to work on Linux full time, I knew that I would have a challenge of lacking all

54:21.800 --> 54:23.360
of the tools that I created.

54:23.360 --> 54:29.560
But I knew this challenge would also motivate me to find out new ways to accomplish things.

54:29.560 --> 54:33.560
And I discovered early on that Linux had ftrace.

54:33.560 --> 54:38.000
And so early on at Netflix, I created a suite of tools called perf tools that were based

54:38.000 --> 54:39.280
on ftrace.

54:39.280 --> 54:42.360
And they let me solve a lot of problems.

54:42.360 --> 54:48.440
I also met Alexei Storyatov, who was working on a new virtual machine for the kernel called

54:48.440 --> 54:49.440
eBPF.

54:49.440 --> 54:54.200
And I saw how that could be used to do more programmatic things.

54:54.200 --> 54:57.160
And so I've also created a lot of tools using eBPF.

54:57.160 --> 55:00.320
And that's the thing is he's just trying to pick up whatever framework comes along that

55:00.320 --> 55:05.120
can actually help him solve his real world problems on whatever operating system he happens

55:05.120 --> 55:06.200
to be using.

55:06.200 --> 55:07.200
Very pragmatic.

55:07.200 --> 55:10.960
The nice part here, too, is that it's kind of been around long enough that it's easy

55:10.960 --> 55:12.000
to access.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.440
And he was working on that problem right at scale.

55:14.440 --> 55:22.200
And so now five years on at Netflix, I can finally do what I want to get done in production

55:22.200 --> 55:23.760
using all of these new tools.

55:23.760 --> 55:26.040
It's really amazing and exciting.

55:26.040 --> 55:31.920
And also we're at the point with these technologies where early on we made sure they got into

55:31.920 --> 55:35.040
the kernel because that takes a long time to propagate.

55:35.040 --> 55:37.200
And now we're getting them packaged.

55:37.200 --> 55:42.560
And so I was swapping emails with Canonical yesterday to make sure the bpftrace package

55:42.560 --> 55:47.520
appears for the Ubuntu distributions, which would be really awesome.

55:47.520 --> 55:50.680
They've already created a snap for it.

55:50.680 --> 55:54.560
And we have BCC, which is the other front end, has been packaged.

55:54.560 --> 55:59.280
So we're at the point where these superpowers, you can use them for analysis just by doing

55:59.280 --> 56:01.960
a package add to a system.

56:01.960 --> 56:06.320
I like that point because he's trying to underscore that they are here or they're coming, really

56:06.320 --> 56:07.320
they're here.

56:07.320 --> 56:08.320
You have these tools.

56:08.320 --> 56:09.320
You can download scripts.

56:09.320 --> 56:10.480
You can install packages.

56:10.480 --> 56:16.880
I do note there that he's using package add, which is the FreeBSD command.

56:16.880 --> 56:19.240
But really the point is this is stuff you should learn.

56:19.240 --> 56:20.240
You don't have to be a programmer.

56:20.240 --> 56:23.040
You don't have to be able to write really complicated scripts because a lot of this

56:23.040 --> 56:25.480
stuff is prepackaged for you.

56:25.480 --> 56:27.520
So let's learn more about what it can do.

56:27.520 --> 56:32.640
Enhanced BPF, also known as just BPF, can do lots of things.

56:32.640 --> 56:34.760
It's kind of crazy to explain.

56:34.760 --> 56:41.240
It began life by a company called Plumgrid that were doing it for software-defined networking.

56:41.240 --> 56:44.220
And Alexei Sotoyov came up with it.

56:44.220 --> 56:49.400
And that was so that it could handle packets and then you could define some sort of proxy

56:49.400 --> 56:53.800
or router or whatever you want in software and it would handle it.

56:53.800 --> 56:54.800
This is really good.

56:54.800 --> 56:57.960
This is really good for us because packets can be very frequent.

56:57.960 --> 57:00.280
Packets themselves can be millions of times a second.

57:00.280 --> 57:05.520
So since this was designed from the beginning to handle very high packet or very high event

57:05.520 --> 57:08.120
rates, it means it's been optimized.

57:08.120 --> 57:12.340
And so we can use it for things like off-CPU analysis and schedule analysis.

57:12.340 --> 57:14.200
It's been used for lots of other things as well.

57:14.200 --> 57:18.000
Denial of service mitigation, intrusion detection, container security, observability, what I

57:18.000 --> 57:22.160
do, BP filter, even device drivers.

57:22.160 --> 57:24.520
There was an infrared device driver written in BPF.

57:24.520 --> 57:28.000
I mean, yeah, you can just use it for basically everything.

57:28.000 --> 57:32.440
And that means people have been speculating it might be taking over the kernel.

57:32.440 --> 57:36.480
There's been a number of discussions about BPF taking over everything to the point where

57:36.480 --> 57:43.080
it seems that the ability to write a user-defined program and have the kernel run it and that

57:43.080 --> 57:48.360
user-defined program to have more and more capabilities sounds a lot like a microkernel.

57:48.360 --> 57:53.000
So microkernels is where you write stuff in user space and you have a minimal kernel that

57:53.000 --> 57:54.160
runs it.

57:54.160 --> 57:59.240
And so it's a little bit scary to think about microkernels and Linux.

57:59.240 --> 58:03.160
But anyway, I think it was Jonathan Corbett who first came up with that realization that

58:03.160 --> 58:05.440
we're heading towards a microkernel.

58:05.440 --> 58:09.000
I want to underscore here too, there is a step where there's an analyzer that takes

58:09.000 --> 58:13.200
the BPF program and the BPF bytecode itself has some nice properties like there are no

58:13.200 --> 58:14.200
loops.

58:14.200 --> 58:16.560
So in some ways you can guarantee that it will halt.

58:16.560 --> 58:18.160
So there are some safety checks.

58:18.160 --> 58:22.240
And because there are disparate systems in the kernel using this stuff, I know that the

58:22.240 --> 58:26.160
a lot of eyes thing is often a fallacy, but it's true, this is just being tested a lot

58:26.160 --> 58:29.960
and it means we're not having disparate code paths that are all doing slightly different

58:29.960 --> 58:30.960
things.

58:30.960 --> 58:33.500
They can all be tested in one unified architecture.

58:33.500 --> 58:36.780
The other thing I think that we should make clear and I didn't really realize is what's

58:36.780 --> 58:37.780
with the name?

58:37.780 --> 58:40.140
Because we're not, maybe we're doing a couple of stuff.

58:40.140 --> 58:43.600
There are networking applications, but that's not really what we're talking about.

58:43.600 --> 58:46.660
So why are we still calling it Berkeley packet filter?

58:46.660 --> 58:52.120
So the question was last year we wanted to change the name of BPF because BPF is kind

58:52.120 --> 58:53.120
of a terrible name.

58:53.120 --> 58:57.360
BPF, maybe I should have said it, it stands for Berkeley Packet Filter, but nowadays what

58:57.360 --> 59:02.200
we're doing has nothing to do with Berkeley, little to do with packets, and little to do

59:02.200 --> 59:03.600
with filtering.

59:03.600 --> 59:11.880
And so a better name would be something like Virtual Kernel Instruction Set, VKIS, a virtual

59:11.880 --> 59:17.000
machine, anyway, Alexi and I are engineers and we're terrible at naming and we couldn't

59:17.000 --> 59:23.120
come up with a better name, and Alexi has settled on BPF because he sees it as, and

59:23.120 --> 59:29.920
like he wants it to be BPF and not EBPF because he sees it as equivalent to x86 and ARM.

59:29.920 --> 59:33.500
Because it is, BPF is an instruction set, and so this is a virtual machine instruction

59:33.500 --> 59:34.500
set.

59:34.500 --> 59:38.720
So he wants it to be three letters like everything else, x86, ARM, BPF.

59:38.720 --> 59:40.000
So that's why we're stuck with BPF.

59:40.000 --> 59:44.200
All right, don't call it EBPF, it's BPF.

59:44.200 --> 59:49.040
I understand, you know, it is, that three letters does make all the difference.

59:49.040 --> 59:54.720
Okay, so that's like a little bit of practical foundation, it is this machine language.

59:54.720 --> 59:58.680
You probably don't want to write that, and it can be a little bit complicated to understand

59:58.680 --> 01:00:01.720
what your next steps are because there are multiple front ends.

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:03.960
There's lots of front ends for BPF.

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:08.760
Raw BPF is where you write instructions like this, BPF instruction level programming.

01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:11.080
There's some samples inside the kernel source code.

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:13.560
I think very few people are ever going to need to do this.

01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:16.640
It's really hard.

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:20.880
There's also, if you look in the kernel source code, there's C examples as well, which is

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:24.240
a little bit higher level.

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:27.020
But we've spent years trying to make it even easier.

01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:32.800
So we've come up with a BCC front end, which has a Python interface, a C++ interface, and

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:34.640
a Lua interface so far.

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:40.000
And I imagine people are going to add other interfaces to BCC as well, other languages.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.960
And so that lets you define your kernel program in C, and then the front end that manages

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:47.040
it in Python or whatever that is.

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:48.040
And that's really pretty handy.

01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:52.160
He'll talk about this a little bit more, but it means you can have one part of your program

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:57.080
actually do all the complicated little BPF stuff, and then rely on nice high level Python

01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:01.300
libraries to do, if you're writing in a REST API on top of this monitoring tool, whatever

01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:02.960
you might be working on.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:07.320
That is what we should contrast with BPF trace, which is what we started talking about.

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:10.260
And that is not really for standalone tools.

01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:13.000
It's for one-off scripting and exploration.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:18.400
And there's another front end called BPF trace, which I was working on a lot last year.

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:24.440
BPF trace is good for powerful one-liners and custom scripts.

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:29.480
And so with BPF trace, I can say, BPF trace, T is for trace point, syscall, sysenter open,

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:37.640
print out the file name, or do a histogram of the read size distribution by process.

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:40.480
And that sounds actually pretty darn handy.

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:41.880
You do need to know how to do that.

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:44.400
Thankfully, there's extensive documentation.

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.420
And maybe this is a good point to underscore.

01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:50.840
This kind of tracing is kind of opening up new bounds, stuff that we haven't really seen

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:53.280
before, not just in Linux, but anywhere.

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:59.040
If you're solving new things, off-CPU analysis was this cool thing we really wanted to do,

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:02.760
but it was so prohibitive to trace scheduler events.

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:04.520
Now BPF is letting us do it.

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:09.640
Another thing it's letting us do is I can save stack traces when a thread blocks.

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:15.600
I can save stack traces when a wake-up event happens, and I can associate wake-up stack

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:17.920
traces with block stack traces.

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:22.200
So I can take that off-CPU time example further with Minecraft, because sometimes when you're

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:26.520
looking at a lock and you're saying, I'm blocked on this lock, your next question is, well,

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:27.520
why?

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:29.880
Why was I blocked for 10 milliseconds on this lock?

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:32.400
Who was holding the lock for 10 milliseconds?

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:33.680
I need to know them.

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:39.640
Well, you can know them if you trace the wake-up events.

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:41.680
So the kernel has to manage this.

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:42.680
The kernel has to...

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:44.680
So a thread releases a lock.

01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:48.160
The kernel then does a wake-up from that thread to the blocked thread.

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:51.400
So you grab the stack trace there and you associate it here.

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:54.360
Doing that association was something we've never done before in kernel context.

01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:58.000
Dtrace could not do it, but it's something that BPF can do.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.640
So you can kind of see why he's excited.

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:01.480
This is genuinely neat stuff.

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:06.120
I like that example because some of the, like, technicalities of the various kprobes and

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:10.880
kernel fixtures that you're attaching to may be beyond a lot of people, but trying to understand

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:15.120
what other part of the system is in contention with you or hogging resources, I think we've

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:17.480
all been trying to diagnose those problems.

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:21.160
But okay, maybe you don't want to write BPF trace scripts or anything.

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:23.360
Is this still applicable and useful?

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:26.880
And I got to say, yes, a lot of these, you can just run on the command line and they

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:29.540
will tell you stuff about your system that you might want to know.

01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:31.720
And you're already installing debugging tools, right?

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:35.040
People are installing stuff to monitor what network connections are happening, stuff to

01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:38.680
monitor what disk space is using or watching IO latency.

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:41.940
These are some of the best tools, especially for end users.

01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:47.000
If you're an end user, the BCC repository has lots of canned tools so you can just use

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000
them straight away.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.840
I only demoed two so far, profile and off CPU time.

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:54.200
But there's lots.

01:03:54.200 --> 01:04:00.300
The tools have man pages, example files, documentation, and usually you can get BCC on a system nowadays

01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:02.640
just by doing apt-get install or yum install.

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:04.480
Which, I mean, is super easy.

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:07.600
And clearly he's used, you know, Linux a little bit there.

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.360
Yeah, there was no doubt.

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:12.740
Actually watching him work, it was pretty clear he knew exactly what he was doing.

01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:17.000
And even if, you know, so in this case, in this example, right, he was showing Minecraft,

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.780
but you know, in his day job, of course, it's this massive, massive scale stuff.

01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:25.880
And so it's fascinating that they've created something that a very, very small portion

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:31.000
of people could write direct bytecode for all the way up to abstracted layers with tools

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.880
that anybody can just pass some flags to.

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:37.620
And it does all of the hard BPF interfacing for you.

01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:38.620
It's a whole range.

01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:39.620
Yeah.

01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:40.620
And the tools aren't hard to use.

01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:42.560
One of them is bio latency.

01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:47.400
As an example, just to have one in the slides, this is a BCC tool called bio latency.

01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:51.480
It's showing the disk IL latency as a histogram.

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:52.520
It's efficient.

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:57.140
So the count column is what's maintained in kernel context.

01:04:57.140 --> 01:05:01.920
And it just copies the count column to user space and user space prints this out.

01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:05.920
Prior implementations, I had to dump out every disk event and post process and user space

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:06.920
and that's too expensive.

01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:11.700
So you can actually just get a really nice histogram right in your terminal, install

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:15.600
it from your package repo, and you can see a histogram of block latency.

01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:20.180
Or another cool example is using and monitoring whatever people are typing into the read line

01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:21.400
library.

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:23.520
Let's hear about OpenSnoop, which is also really cool.

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:27.160
If you want to go see whatever TCP connections are happening on your system, well, there's

01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:28.160
OpenSnoop.

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:31.720
OpenSnoop shows all the files that are open.

01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:38.860
In fact, it's great for locating config files and log files and things that can help you

01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:40.520
troubleshoot or debug software.

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:41.520
Yeah.

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.640
So maybe you're running some new software you've never run before and you're trying

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:46.000
to wonder, where are the configuration files?

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.480
What files are touching or modifying on my system?

01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:50.540
OpenSnoop tells you in real time.

01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:53.280
That's another sneaky app pick right there for the episode.

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:55.760
OpenSnoop is another great tool that people should go grab.

01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:56.760
Yeah.

01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:59.560
Another one right there with it is ExecSnoop, which is the same thing, but you can watch

01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:03.400
as users on your system are running applications.

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:05.640
You can just watch whatever they're executing.

01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:08.880
ExecSnoop tells me what's happening when Minecraft starts up.

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:14.600
I can say, okay, so that ran, and then it ran this thing, and then it ran these other

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:15.600
things.

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:17.800
Oh, he just has the best presentation style, right?

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:19.760
I love listening to Brendan Craig.

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:22.520
There were so many cool tools, Wes, that he covered during this talk.

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:25.800
Like a couple of times I leaned over to you and I'm like, man, we got to tell people about

01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:26.800
this.

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:27.800
Oh my gosh.

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:28.800
Yes.

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:29.800
Right?

01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:30.800
There's just so many that you might want to use.

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:33.720
EXT4 slower comes to mind, which is where you can just go watch slow EXT4 stuff.

01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:37.720
You can actually debug the file system separate from how it's interacting with the block device.

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:42.120
You can actually isolate where the part of the problem on your system is.

01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:46.920
You can also instrument things like TCP open or close calls so you can understand them.

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:48.760
Now unfortunately there are some gaps.

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:54.440
You may notice that there's no UDP commands here, but this is all a project run under

01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:56.160
the IO visor name.

01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:59.360
That's a bit weird, but it's actually under, you never would have guessed it, Chris, the

01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:01.760
Linux Foundation.

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:03.600
And that's where BCC lives.

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:05.000
That's where all these cool tools are.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.920
You can just install them, start playing with them.

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:10.880
We'll have linked in the show notes this great graphic that just sort of instruments the

01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:14.200
stack and tells you here's how you do application level debugging.

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:16.760
There's one to go look for slow MySQL queries.

01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:17.760
Just build right in.

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:19.920
You don't have to do anything to specially tune it.

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:21.260
Just run that command.

01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:23.720
So it's super easy to find and play with.

01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:27.580
And really the reason I wanted to talk about this today is because this is new technology.

01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:31.720
And I think Brendan says it best, but we should all be sharing the cool stuff you can do with

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:32.720
it.

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:33.720
So takeaways.

01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:37.160
You can really explore systems in powerful, new and custom ways.

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:42.560
You can also contribute and also please, if you can share war stories and blog posts and

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:46.840
give talks about these tools, it's a lot of new stuff.

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:52.640
And if you come up with a cool usage, it's going to help the BPF community to share it.

01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:57.760
We are finally living in the world that we've all really wanted, where we have a functional

01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:00.960
D trace for Linux or something even better.

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:04.120
And the future is probably going to be GUIs and other tools, but it's not going to get

01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:06.080
there unless we build it.

01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:10.900
Yeah, I think that's the important thing for people listening to keep in mind is if you're

01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:15.200
an expert at this kind of stuff, it's totally ready for you to jump in right now.

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:20.520
But in a year or two, Brandon thinks that we'll probably see graphical applications

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:25.140
where you check a few boxes, click a few buttons and run it against the application.

01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:31.080
And it does a lot of this deep analysis for you in a very consumable way in a graphical

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:32.080
session.

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:35.280
And we're not there yet, but those tools are likely coming.

01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:40.040
And it's kind of exciting because this is a major new feature that's been retrofitted

01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:42.840
into our lovable Linux operating system.

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:43.840
Yeah, really.

01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:45.640
I mean, eBPF is here to stay.

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:46.640
Start playing with it.

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:49.400
You can use it for all kinds of better ways to understand your system.

01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:52.180
And in the future, hey, it might just replace your firewall.

01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:55.360
But that is for another show.

01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:58.120
And a big thank you to Brandon for giving that talk.

01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:00.240
And he kind of inspired us, you know, at the end there and he was like, spread the word

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:01.240
about this stuff.

01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:04.080
This is really cool things that we can do now.

01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:08.400
And it's a challenging topic sometimes to talk about because it's not necessarily applicable

01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:09.640
to everybody's day to day life.

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:11.600
And it's a slightly technical thing.

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:15.680
But at the same time, it's a massive kick ass feature that our favorite operating system

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:16.680
now has.

01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:19.360
And it is worth spreading the word on that stuff.

01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:22.360
So thank you for grabbing those clips, Wes.

01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:23.360
All right.

01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:25.920
Well, we do have to kind of wrap it up there.

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:27.100
We could keep going all day.

01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:31.040
But at some point, I do have to hit the road and keep on moving on because I got to get

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:32.040
back up to that studio.

01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:33.600
There's nothing like hanging out in the studio with Wes.

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:38.600
I think we've learned it's not safe for you to stay in one place for too long.

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:39.800
You know what's funny too, man?

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:47.120
You think about it is I drive around with a live tracker in my RV posted at jupyterbroadcasting.com

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:48.460
slash rover.

01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:52.460
And I have never had a problem from an audience member.

01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:53.860
It's never been an issue.

01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:57.760
The people that I had issues with probably had they would have no idea that I had a tracker

01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:58.760
in there.

01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:01.520
Although if they had stolen the RV, oh, that would have been pretty handy.

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:06.440
We would have known where they take the thing is, too, is I've got two different trackers

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:07.440
in this RV.

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:10.760
So even if you saw the visible one, there's a hidden tracker as well.

01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:13.920
So we totally would be able to find it.

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:15.400
And that would have been a hell of a story.

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:17.400
I just not one I want to share.

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:18.680
I'm glad it didn't go that way.

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:21.120
Hey, go check out Wes on TechSnap.

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:26.680
They just did a killer episode on machine learning and the ethics of AI.

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:30.320
I learned so much from that episode TechSnap.Systems.

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:31.320
Go check it out.

01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:32.560
He's at Wes Payne.

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:34.420
I'm at Chris LAS.

01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:40.260
And if you're craving more Linux news, go check out LinuxActionNews.com a weekly Linux

01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:48.720
snoop news podcast between Joe and I about 30 minutes every week, but the most important

01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:54.240
thing you could do is join us live on a Tuesday over at jblive.tv.

01:10:54.240 --> 01:11:11.680
See you next Tuesday.

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:25.600
??

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:26.600
??

01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:27.600
?

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:28.600
??

01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:29.600
??

01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:30.600
?

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:31.600
?

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:37.680
You know, I didn't, uh, I didn't think about doing this in the main show.

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:41.120
Well, I kind of thought about it, but, Wes, I've decided.

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:43.700
I've decided to out you in the post show.

01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:46.740
Ladies and gentlemen, it has come to my attention.

01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:47.740
The Mr.

01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:51.060
Wes Payne has gotten hooked on the disco dingo Sauce.

01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:52.920
Well, let's do it.

01:11:52.920 --> 01:12:09.680
So what do you think so far, Wes, of the old 1904 beta?

01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:12.280
Or I guess I'm not even sure if it's beta yet, you maniac.

01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:16.360
I mean, I did grab it from the dailies, so I don't think so.

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:17.360
That's what you gotta do.

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:18.360
You gotta do that.

01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:19.360
It is what you gotta do.

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:20.360
Honestly, it's been a lot of fun.

01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:25.400
I kept talking about it on that there Linux Action News program that I enjoy so much.

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:30.080
And I was like, okay, well, I know Chris, and I know what he's been through with Gnome.

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:35.420
So if he's talking about this, and then you mentioned some other stuff about disco.

01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:37.560
So I was like, that's gonna be what I'm gonna run.

01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:38.720
I was really happy.

01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:43.440
Honestly, Neon's been working just fine for me, almost no issues, super rock solid, wasn't

01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:44.440
in a hurry.

01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:46.560
I mean, I've got other partitions for trying stuff out.

01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:49.160
I wasn't in a hurry to repave there.

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:51.040
Gnome about disco, though, it's getting me in that fever.

01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:55.880
I don't think I'll wipe it just yet, but I have been spending almost all my time on the

01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:56.880
live install.

01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:57.880
Yeah.

01:12:57.880 --> 01:12:58.880
Huh.

01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:01.560
You know, I'll tell you, the reason what's really drawn me in, and I don't know how long

01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:02.560
this is gonna last.

01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:07.920
So this is kind of an interesting experiment, in a sense, is it's not often, it's not very

01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:13.720
often that you install something, and it is perceptibly much faster.

01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:14.720
That's what struck me.

01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:17.720
I just was like, this is super pleasant, and I could stay here.

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:18.720
Yeah.

01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:19.720
That's fun.

01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:24.640
And, you know, often you'll get that with just a fresh install, but I have installed

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:29.960
Gnome a few times, and I'm familiar with what a fresh Gnome Shell install is like.

01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:30.960
And this is different.

01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:32.400
This is a totally different beast.

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:33.880
Rawhide's version's great, too.

01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:37.480
It really is, but Disco Dingo just seems like perhaps they're a little bit further along

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:39.760
in their implementation and a little more thoughtful.

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:40.760
And you know what?

01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:43.040
I gotta say, like, credit where credit is due.

01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:48.280
The Fedora camp and the Red Hat team has plugged away on Gnome Shell for a very long time.

01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:53.000
They've fixed some important things, but it is without a shadow of a doubt in my mind

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:58.160
that Gnome is getting in a much, much better state now that Canonical is involved in the

01:13:58.160 --> 01:13:59.160
project.

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:00.720
They're putting their efforts into the project, too.

01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:06.240
And we are seeing the collective results of more people, more talented people working

01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:10.680
on Gnome Shell, and it's just simply making it a better product.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:15.440
And man, if that's not great, and if that isn't just one of the best damn things about

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:21.040
open source, because these two companies are competitors, yet they're making it a better

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:22.040
product.

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:23.040
Right.

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:26.240
We can find some collaborative shared resources and infrastructure that we can all invest

01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:28.000
in and we all get to benefit.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.000
It's so great.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.000
It's just so great.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.880
And, you know, and that's not to take anything away from Plasma or Mate or any other great

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:35.880
desktop environment.

01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:39.520
No, actually, I was wanting to go play with that new Mate release, but I was like, well,

01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:44.120
I'm already kind of playing with a different desktop environment release, so maybe I'll

01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:45.120
wait a little bit.

01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:46.000
I've always loved Mate, too.
