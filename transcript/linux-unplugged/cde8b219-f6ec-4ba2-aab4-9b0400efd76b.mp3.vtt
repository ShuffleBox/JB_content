00:00.000 --> 00:04.440
I think Star Trek has some of the best sound effects in the sci-fi biz, one of the things

00:04.440 --> 00:05.980
that's kept them around.

00:05.980 --> 00:12.820
And so I was pretty excited when I saw on the subreddit that KabiLinux, K-A-B-I Linux,

00:12.820 --> 00:16.640
he wrote this post saying, hoping some here will like this, but if you have the package

00:16.640 --> 00:21.000
SOX installed, that's S-O-X, you can run the code below in the terminal and it will pump

00:21.000 --> 00:25.800
out what sounds like the hum of the Enterprise without the wobble, unfortunately.

00:25.800 --> 00:27.680
But you also don't need the warp core.

00:27.680 --> 00:31.800
So first you have to have the SOX package installed on your machine, and then you run

00:31.800 --> 00:40.440
this play command here, and once you hit play, it creates the engine sound effect of the

00:40.440 --> 00:45.160
Enterprise D, which is a pretty cool white noise effect.

00:45.160 --> 00:49.560
And then if you're like a professional internet broadcaster, you'll have other sounds ready

00:49.560 --> 00:56.160
to go, like Star Trek bridge sounds, and then it really sounds like you're in Star Trek

00:56.160 --> 00:59.880
now, which is pretty cool, just using SOX.

00:59.880 --> 01:01.440
I got a kick out of that.

01:01.440 --> 01:06.000
So you don't have to have, although, I mean, I added the sound effects from the bridge,

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
but there you go.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.680
So maybe instead of doing Linux unplugged this time, today we'll do Star Trek unplugged.

01:09.680 --> 01:10.680
You think that'd be a hit?

01:10.680 --> 01:22.320
I think we tried that once, I don't think it worked very well.

01:22.320 --> 01:26.480
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that spent more time on a spreadsheet

01:26.480 --> 01:29.520
this week than the last 10 years.

01:29.520 --> 01:31.920
My name is Chris, and we have a heck of an episode for you.

01:31.920 --> 01:36.520
This is episode 94 of the Linux Unplugged show, and joining us in just a little bit

01:36.520 --> 01:41.800
will be Michael Arabell from Ferronix to discuss a new initiative he's working on, Linux benchmarking

01:41.800 --> 01:42.800
automated style.

01:42.800 --> 01:46.280
You know, wouldn't it be interesting to track the progress of some of the most important

01:46.280 --> 01:50.760
projects like, oh, I don't know, the Linux kernel, GCC, LLVM?

01:50.760 --> 01:53.560
When they release new builds, how does that impact their performance?

01:53.560 --> 01:58.160
Well, over at linuxbenchmarking.com, Michael has set out just to find that out, automated

01:58.160 --> 02:00.760
builds after new releases with charts.

02:00.760 --> 02:03.600
Go in there and say, how's the Linux kernel been trending the last six months?

02:03.600 --> 02:05.160
And this site might just show you.

02:05.160 --> 02:07.080
What's this initiative all about, and what is his goal?

02:07.080 --> 02:08.080
We'll talk to him today.

02:08.080 --> 02:12.840
Also, we'll give him a little congrats on the 11th year of Ferronix.com, so that'll

02:12.840 --> 02:13.840
be coming up.

02:13.840 --> 02:17.120
And then later in the show, we're gonna talk about Fedora 22, a new release that just hit

02:17.120 --> 02:18.120
the web today.

02:18.120 --> 02:19.120
I installed it.

02:19.120 --> 02:20.840
We've got some initial reactions.

02:20.840 --> 02:24.200
We're gonna give you a full review on Sunday's Linux action show, but today, I ran into a

02:24.200 --> 02:29.080
snag or two that you might run into if you have a certain make Nvidia card that'll prevent

02:29.080 --> 02:30.080
GDM from starting.

02:30.080 --> 02:32.720
I'll tell you how to fix that in today's episode and give you my first reactions, get some

02:32.720 --> 02:34.800
mumble room takes.

02:34.800 --> 02:43.120
But before we get to any of that, we do have some serious business to get to, some unfortunate

02:43.120 --> 02:44.860
sad news.

02:44.860 --> 02:48.400
Every now and then, a great distribution comes and goes.

02:48.400 --> 02:51.120
The company and people behind them come and go.

02:51.120 --> 02:57.320
And this week, it appears to be official, Mandriva, the company behind the Linux distribution

02:57.320 --> 03:03.400
so many of us, so, so many of us started out with, is officially going away.

03:03.400 --> 03:08.720
Yes, apparently, according to a post over in Germany, or maybe it was France, there's

03:08.720 --> 03:09.720
a translation.

03:09.720 --> 03:11.440
Thankfully, Ferronix has one for us.

03:11.440 --> 03:18.080
Even though the company made $553,000 last year, not enough for 10 to 19 employees, Mandriva

03:18.080 --> 03:21.080
as a company is now being liquidated.

03:21.080 --> 03:26.680
And to help reflect on this once great distribution, I'll bring in our mumble room.

03:26.680 --> 03:28.640
Time appropriate greetings, mumble room.

03:28.640 --> 03:29.640
Hello.

03:29.640 --> 03:30.640
Hello.

03:30.640 --> 03:36.160
So any Mandriva users, say I. Any Mandriva users in here or Mandrake users back in the

03:36.160 --> 03:37.160
day?

03:37.160 --> 03:38.160
I.

03:38.160 --> 03:39.160
I.

03:39.160 --> 03:40.160
I.

03:40.160 --> 03:41.160
Me.

03:41.160 --> 03:42.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:42.160 --> 03:43.160
It's kind of sad.

03:43.160 --> 03:44.160
That's what got me started.

03:44.160 --> 03:45.160
Yeah, it really was.

03:45.160 --> 03:48.480
I mean, I probably started with dubbing a Red Hat technically, but when it came time

03:48.480 --> 03:54.720
for Linux for me that I wanted to cut my teeth on and use for on my systems, I used Mandrake.

03:54.720 --> 03:56.440
And I even became a Mandrake club member.

03:56.440 --> 04:01.040
I was in the Mandrake club, so I got the special URPMI repos.

04:01.040 --> 04:03.720
I felt pretty cool.

04:03.720 --> 04:07.920
And I don't know what this means for the offshoots, like Mandriva and others.

04:07.920 --> 04:08.920
Magia.

04:08.920 --> 04:09.920
Moondrake?

04:09.920 --> 04:10.920
Was that the other one, Rotten Corpse?

04:10.920 --> 04:11.920
Yeah, there's Moondrake.

04:11.920 --> 04:15.960
Well, I think that was a spinoff of the original Mandrake.

04:15.960 --> 04:16.960
Yeah, okay.

04:16.960 --> 04:17.960
Yeah, yeah.

04:17.960 --> 04:23.200
I don't know what it means for those guys, and Open Mandriva, of course, like that.

04:23.200 --> 04:26.640
That doesn't seem to have been like a lot of interest taking up in those, though.

04:26.640 --> 04:27.640
Mandrake 8.

04:27.640 --> 04:28.640
Yep, Mandrake 8.

04:28.640 --> 04:29.640
Whiskey.

04:29.640 --> 04:30.640
I had that in the box.

04:30.640 --> 04:31.640
That was great.

04:31.640 --> 04:32.640
Mandrake 8 in the box was great.

04:32.640 --> 04:36.160
You know, one of the great things about Mandrake back in the day was that it had the Drac config.

04:36.160 --> 04:40.320
Let's see if I can find a picture of this Mandrake Drac config.

04:40.320 --> 04:42.120
You guys know what I'm talking about?

04:42.120 --> 04:43.640
I mean, Open, or Drac Conf.

04:43.640 --> 04:44.640
That's what it was.

04:44.640 --> 04:45.640
Drac Conf.

04:45.640 --> 04:49.700
OpenSUSE, of course, had Yast, which was, you know, pretty great.

04:49.700 --> 04:54.280
But I felt like, in some ways, Linux Mandrake's Drac Conf had the leg up when it came to like

04:54.280 --> 04:58.120
the Samba automation and user creation and just managing services.

04:58.120 --> 05:00.040
It just felt like a quicker, faster tool.

05:00.040 --> 05:04.460
Boy, looking back at it now, it really looks antiquated.

05:04.460 --> 05:09.960
But this was sort of like, this was sort of your only front-end option, really, when configuring

05:09.960 --> 05:13.600
X really meant getting into your Xorg comp file.

05:13.600 --> 05:21.160
And if you just, you know, didn't want to hassle with that stuff, this was so perfect.

05:21.160 --> 05:24.200
And it did get more refined over the years.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.200
And it got forked.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.800
It's still out there in different iterations.

05:26.800 --> 05:34.400
But there was a time where I was able to, you know, fully set up Active Directory authentication,

05:34.400 --> 05:36.200
automated NTP setup.

05:36.200 --> 05:42.040
All these things that you just had to do by hand back then in Linux, Wi-Fi, like when

05:42.040 --> 05:48.160
Wi-Fi was brand new, like Mandrake made it easiest to get it working back then.

05:48.160 --> 05:50.220
It was a really great distro.

05:50.220 --> 05:55.040
And the other thing they did, and they gave you really, you know, straightforward front-end

05:55.040 --> 05:57.240
options for starting and stopping services.

05:57.240 --> 06:03.040
The other thing they did early on is they provided a really solid solution to how crappy

06:03.040 --> 06:04.920
RPMs were.

06:04.920 --> 06:12.200
You know, they had URPMI, which really was, in some ways, maybe better than YUM, maybe

06:12.200 --> 06:14.640
not, I don't know anymore, DNF, like who could say.

06:14.640 --> 06:18.200
But it was definitely way better than any other RPM-based distro out there.

06:18.200 --> 06:26.600
This was really, in my opinion, the usable RPM-based distro at the time because of URPMI.

06:26.600 --> 06:31.600
And then they had like, you know, one of the first software source managers where you could

06:31.600 --> 06:33.920
manage between online sources, update sources, and CDs.

06:33.920 --> 06:38.720
And again, SUSE got all that and yassed pretty quickly.

06:38.720 --> 06:42.480
But that's what made Mandrake work so well, I think, for people.

06:42.480 --> 06:45.440
And man, they had the best installer.

06:45.440 --> 06:50.960
Mandrake had a really unique installer where the progress was all down on the left-hand

06:50.960 --> 06:51.960
side of the installer.

06:51.960 --> 06:52.960
Yeah, here it is.

06:52.960 --> 06:53.960
Here it is.

06:53.960 --> 06:55.000
Yeah, I don't know if you guys remember this.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.640
They also had the best partitioner back in the day, too.

06:57.640 --> 06:59.920
They really had a great partitioner.

06:59.920 --> 07:03.040
And so you always knew right where you're at in the installation process, and you could

07:03.040 --> 07:04.040
jump back and forth.

07:04.040 --> 07:06.600
And they kept that look for years.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.760
They refined it over time and made it look a little better.

07:08.760 --> 07:10.840
But they kept that basic functionality.

07:10.840 --> 07:14.280
So I'm showing you right here, I'm showing you like, this is like a super old version

07:14.280 --> 07:15.280
of Mandrake.

07:15.280 --> 07:17.200
And then here's Mandrake 9.1.

07:17.200 --> 07:19.440
And then here is Mandrake 2005.

07:19.440 --> 07:25.160
And they kept that, and here's 9.1 again, they kept that list along the side.

07:25.160 --> 07:26.720
It was so cool.

07:26.720 --> 07:33.520
I think they had, and they had a great text installer, too, if you had to go that route.

07:33.520 --> 07:34.520
Oh, man.

07:34.520 --> 07:35.520
Oh, wow.

07:35.520 --> 07:40.880
Oh, this screenshot, Mandrake Linux 8, here it is.

07:40.880 --> 07:42.960
This was my bag back in the day.

07:42.960 --> 07:44.200
Oh, wow.

07:44.200 --> 07:46.360
This is so old looking now.

07:46.360 --> 07:49.360
I can't really get any better on it.

07:49.360 --> 07:53.560
And they were one of the first to make it easy to use riserfs, too.

07:53.560 --> 07:56.640
Like they made it super easy to use journaled file systems when journaled file systems were

07:56.640 --> 08:00.080
brand new to Linux.

08:00.080 --> 08:04.200
And they had security things you could do in the installation that would sort of tell

08:04.200 --> 08:08.800
you how secure it was going to be and give you sort of like a report.

08:08.800 --> 08:11.440
You could make a boot disk during the installation.

08:11.440 --> 08:16.200
So in case you ever screwed up your bootloader installation during the installer process,

08:16.200 --> 08:18.880
it'll ask you if you wanted to make, of course, it'd be up to a floppy disk, because back

08:18.880 --> 08:20.600
then everybody had floppy disks.

08:20.600 --> 08:25.160
But it would make you an emergency bootloader floppy disk that you could always get back

08:25.160 --> 08:29.680
into your Linux installation with if you somehow hosed your bootloader.

08:29.680 --> 08:31.720
How come we don't do that now?

08:31.720 --> 08:33.360
Why did we stop doing that?

08:33.360 --> 08:38.040
And then of course, because X was a total monster back then, the last thing you did

08:38.040 --> 08:41.360
in the installation, because it was actually, technically it was fine if at this point the

08:41.360 --> 08:44.080
installation totally locked up, because everything was pretty much done.

08:44.080 --> 08:46.720
I don't know if it was unmounted the file systems, but beyond that, pretty much everything

08:46.720 --> 08:47.720
was done.

08:47.720 --> 08:53.560
So the last thing it would do is launch their super cool X configuration thing where you'd

08:53.560 --> 08:56.720
go into this X configurator and it had arrows along the edges of the screen so you could

08:56.720 --> 09:01.520
see if you had overscan on your CRT monitor, and you could tweak it back in and position

09:01.520 --> 09:04.880
it just right, and then save that, and it would write your Xorg config for you.

09:04.880 --> 09:06.800
It wasn't even Xorg back then, it was just X11.

09:06.800 --> 09:12.120
It would write your X11 config, and they'd put it intentionally, if you're watching the

09:12.120 --> 09:13.720
video version, you can see it's the last step right there.

09:13.720 --> 09:17.520
They did it intentionally because that was always the thing that crashed.

09:17.520 --> 09:20.000
Because you had to tell it what your video card was.

09:20.000 --> 09:25.080
You had to tell it everything about your, you had to tell it what your monitor's capable

09:25.080 --> 09:26.080
of doing.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.960
It couldn't detect any of that.

09:27.960 --> 09:32.920
And a lot of times the CRT monitors were very particular, oh and so were the early LCD monitors,

09:32.920 --> 09:39.360
and they had, again, one of the best setups to do that, that final X11 step.

09:39.360 --> 09:44.160
It almost makes me want to go find an ISO and do it one more time, except for old Linux

09:44.160 --> 09:48.960
is actually never quite as great as you remember.

09:48.960 --> 09:52.800
In Mumble Room, you guys have any passing Mandriva or Mandrake thoughts you want to

09:52.800 --> 09:57.440
share before we move on?

09:57.440 --> 10:01.200
I think it was time.

10:01.200 --> 10:08.680
They didn't have anything in their final few years that made them stand out, and the community

10:08.680 --> 10:13.720
fell away, went to their fault products.

10:13.720 --> 10:18.240
They didn't need to keep going on because they had nothing left.

10:18.240 --> 10:24.040
And they were of a product of a different time, where you had these problems, like you

10:24.040 --> 10:33.240
had to have the Xconfig, you had to have XF86config was the command, thank you Minimic.

10:33.240 --> 10:34.680
You had to have things like that.

10:34.680 --> 10:37.640
You also, at the end of the installation, towards the end of the installation, had to

10:37.640 --> 10:39.760
figure out how was the user going to get online?

10:39.760 --> 10:42.920
Because it was an assume they didn't even have an ethernet port.

10:42.920 --> 10:48.400
They might have had USB, but they probably had an ISP that required something like PPOE

10:48.400 --> 10:51.920
or PPTP, and so they had to build these things in.

10:51.920 --> 10:52.920
They had to accommodate for these.

10:52.920 --> 10:56.680
And then later on, when the new generation distributions came around, they didn't have

10:56.680 --> 10:58.800
to really account for kinds of these things.

10:58.800 --> 11:00.040
Now, Kernelix, I wanted to give you a chance.

11:00.040 --> 11:02.560
Were you a Mandrake user back in the day?

11:02.560 --> 11:08.800
So Mandrake Linux was actually the first Linux I ever used.

11:08.800 --> 11:14.240
I'd been asking around if anyone knew of this Linux or where I could obtain it, and finally

11:14.240 --> 11:17.520
I found a guy that said, oh, here, I got a copy for you.

11:17.520 --> 11:20.640
So he gave it to me on a CD, and I remember sticking it in my computer, and I was all

11:20.640 --> 11:23.560
excited because I was going to try this Linux thing that was going to be more stable and

11:23.560 --> 11:25.600
more secure and was going to do everything for me.

11:25.600 --> 11:29.560
I stick the CD in there and I boot off of it, and I remember an X showed up.

11:29.560 --> 11:33.360
The cursor was an X back then, and I was so excited because I was like, I remember thinking

11:33.360 --> 11:37.520
to myself, wow, what an awesome cursor replacement, an X rather than an arrow.

11:37.520 --> 11:38.520
That makes so much sense.

11:38.520 --> 11:39.760
I got it and it really didn't make any sense.

11:39.760 --> 11:44.000
I was just happy that it was not Microsoft, and I booted into Linux, and I was so excited.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.880
I was like, oh, look, it comes with games, and it comes with a word processor, and wait,

11:47.880 --> 11:52.400
network doesn't work, and sound doesn't work, and my display is limited to 800 by 600, and

11:52.400 --> 11:53.760
here's a couple other things that don't work.

11:53.760 --> 11:55.280
So all right, no problem.

11:55.280 --> 11:58.520
Played with it for a couple days and decided I'm going to go back to Windows.

11:58.520 --> 12:02.380
I stick my, at the time I think it was Windows ME or Windows 2000, I stick the disk back

12:02.380 --> 12:07.920
in there, and it didn't recognize the partition that Mandrake had used, and so it just didn't

12:07.920 --> 12:12.040
see my hard drive, and I just didn't have a computer with internet for like three months.

12:12.040 --> 12:15.680
And after that experience, and when I finally did get it fixed, I swore I would never touch

12:15.680 --> 12:17.800
Linux again because it was such a horrible experience.

12:17.800 --> 12:20.200
Well, good thing that didn't stick.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.160
Yeah, well, there you go.

12:22.160 --> 12:27.520
I remember I also, I was such a Mandrake fan, I tried out their Mandrake Enterprise servers

12:27.520 --> 12:28.520
they rolled out.

12:28.520 --> 12:32.760
The first squid proxy server I ever deployed ran on Mandrake using Mandrake in a server

12:32.760 --> 12:33.760
edition.

12:33.760 --> 12:37.600
Like I said, I became a Mandrake club member, whatever they called it back then.

12:37.600 --> 12:38.600
I was all in.

12:38.600 --> 12:42.920
I was all, I bought every box set that they sold.

12:42.920 --> 12:45.560
It was pretty cool.

12:45.560 --> 12:53.380
So hopes and our best to the Mandrake folks and the Mandrave company, and to the offshoots

12:53.380 --> 12:56.400
that continue on in sort of their legacy.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.840
So that is being very nostalgic.

12:58.840 --> 13:03.420
Now let's go to the total opposite end of the spectrum, and this is so cool, and it

13:03.420 --> 13:05.760
really does make it feel like 2015.

13:05.760 --> 13:09.360
Then you're going to be able to share your smartphone GPS location information with the

13:09.360 --> 13:13.160
location services built into the GNOME desktop to make that more accurate.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.800
And you might be wondering why, but it actually is sort of useful.

13:15.800 --> 13:21.040
The GNOME desktop derives a lot of information when you allow it based on your IP location

13:21.040 --> 13:25.160
primarily, unless you actually have a computer with a GPS chip in it that talks to the Linux

13:25.160 --> 13:26.440
system.

13:26.440 --> 13:29.560
And what it does, the things I'm aware of, and I'm sure there's many more, is it sets

13:29.560 --> 13:34.200
things like automatically your time zone, best NTP server, calendar settings, a lot

13:34.200 --> 13:35.800
of little things like this.

13:35.800 --> 13:39.040
And the more accurate you get that, the better GNOME is, especially if you're in a laptop

13:39.040 --> 13:40.040
and you're traveling.

13:40.040 --> 13:41.040
Like, say, take Noah, for example.

13:41.040 --> 13:46.160
When he's in Grand Forks right now, and then he comes over here to the JB1 studio, if GNOME

13:46.160 --> 13:50.040
is aware of his location, it'll automatically adjust his clock and his calendar appointment

13:50.040 --> 13:52.680
reminders for him to be in this time zone.

13:52.680 --> 13:57.280
And so as part of the Google Summer of Code project, there is a developer who is aiming

13:57.280 --> 14:03.680
to set up an app that'll share location information when you have this other companion app on

14:03.680 --> 14:05.880
the Android device called GeoClue.

14:05.880 --> 14:06.880
And this is pretty cool.

14:06.880 --> 14:10.200
A GPS position is something that most of us are obviously pretty familiar with, but you

14:10.200 --> 14:12.480
might not always understand why.

14:12.480 --> 14:15.280
So this would kind of be a way you could play with it on your Linux desktop without having

14:15.280 --> 14:17.920
to have a GPS chip in your computer to see if there's any value in it.

14:17.920 --> 14:19.400
I think that's kind of neat.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.840
And they're adding more and more things in GNOME, like maps and things like that, that

14:21.840 --> 14:22.840
could use this.

14:22.840 --> 14:25.720
Plus, you got to assume other projects could take advantage of this.

14:25.720 --> 14:29.640
So each time the Android location listener application in the background gets a new location,

14:29.640 --> 14:33.420
which Android is doing this all the time for Google Now or for your weather checking application

14:33.420 --> 14:37.760
or, you know, the way it works on Android is for the most part, not always, but for

14:37.760 --> 14:41.560
the most part, if an application needs location, it just asks the location service instead

14:41.560 --> 14:42.920
of having to hit the GPS itself.

14:42.920 --> 14:46.720
Because if another application just checked 55 milliseconds ago, five minutes ago, why

14:46.720 --> 14:49.700
hit the GPS antenna again when you can just check that database?

14:49.700 --> 14:51.800
So that's essentially what the service does.

14:51.800 --> 14:56.320
So anytime that database is updated, this app also gets notified, this GeoClue.

14:56.320 --> 14:59.960
Using MDNS on your Wi-Fi network, it'll auto discover the companion app running on your

14:59.960 --> 15:05.160
GNOME desktop, and anytime that location database gets updated on Android, a copy of that notification

15:05.160 --> 15:09.760
will be sent over the network, over Wi-Fi, to the companion app on your GNOME desktop.

15:09.760 --> 15:13.300
So any app that checks the location on your Android device will then also update the location

15:13.300 --> 15:14.300
information for GNOME.

15:14.300 --> 15:18.280
So you kind of get the benefit of getting constant location information without having

15:18.280 --> 15:20.840
to hit your battery really hard because it's just hitting it when the other apps are already

15:20.840 --> 15:22.640
hitting it.

15:22.640 --> 15:25.400
And of course, you could just turn off the bridging app if you didn't want to use that

15:25.400 --> 15:26.400
or not use it.

15:26.400 --> 15:29.560
I think it's an interesting start, and it's an interesting use of Google Summer of Code,

15:29.560 --> 15:34.040
and it could make the location-based stuff that we're seeing the GNOME project work on

15:34.040 --> 15:38.480
more relevant without having to have expensive hardware in your laptop or desktop because

15:38.480 --> 15:39.800
I'm never going to put a GPS.

15:39.800 --> 15:43.480
I might maybe one day have like an LTE card in a laptop that has GPS built in.

15:43.480 --> 15:46.560
That'd be pretty cool, but I'm never going to have that in my arch desktop upstairs in

15:46.560 --> 15:47.840
my office.

15:47.840 --> 15:51.180
So now I can take advantage of some of those same location things using that without a

15:51.180 --> 15:52.180
big battery drain.

15:52.180 --> 15:55.280
I think it's pretty cool.

15:55.280 --> 15:57.240
And you can also power other machines.

15:57.240 --> 16:00.080
It's not just a, this is the other thing I thought was interesting, is you could have

16:00.080 --> 16:03.320
like five of your desktops to this one Android device.

16:03.320 --> 16:06.800
So five of your GNOME desktops, for example, could all be getting location if they're all

16:06.800 --> 16:07.800
like all in the same spot.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.700
See, it's not a one-to-one ratio.

16:09.700 --> 16:13.400
So one phone can update the location for multiple desktops as well, which is kind of a neat

16:13.400 --> 16:14.400
feature, I think.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.480
I'll tell you about another neat feature.

16:16.480 --> 16:20.680
That'd be our next sponsor right here on the Linux Unplugged program, and that is our friends

16:20.680 --> 16:22.080
over at Ting.

16:22.080 --> 16:27.040
Go to linux.ting.com to get a limited time $50 discount off your first Ting device or

16:27.040 --> 16:30.720
if you have a Ting-compatible device, they'll give you a $50 service credit.

16:30.720 --> 16:35.640
Now, when I signed up, I got a $25 service credit, and that paid for more than my first

16:35.640 --> 16:36.640
month.

16:36.640 --> 16:39.680
So I can only imagine what $50 is going to do for you guys, or really, just go get a

16:39.680 --> 16:40.680
brand new device.

16:40.680 --> 16:45.520
Ting has a great range of devices, from starting literally like around $50 for a feature phone

16:45.520 --> 16:48.960
all the way up to the best Android phones and iPhones out in the market today.

16:48.960 --> 16:51.560
And they just recently added the OnePlus, which you can get right from Ting, which is

16:51.560 --> 16:52.560
really great.

16:52.560 --> 16:55.280
So go to linux.ting.com to take advantage of that $50 discount.

16:55.280 --> 16:57.000
Now why Ting's service?

16:57.000 --> 16:58.400
Why switch to Ting?

16:58.400 --> 17:01.240
First of all, I think you're going to like the fact that you only pay for what you use.

17:01.240 --> 17:02.520
Finally, right?

17:02.520 --> 17:03.560
That's how it should always be.

17:03.560 --> 17:07.120
And sometimes outside the US, that is how it is, but not here in the US.

17:07.120 --> 17:08.540
We have a duopoly in place.

17:08.540 --> 17:12.360
This duopoly controls the market with a strong arm that you wouldn't believe.

17:12.360 --> 17:14.480
And so there's very little flexibility in here.

17:14.480 --> 17:17.440
So Ting had to come up with a whole new way to do this.

17:17.440 --> 17:20.600
So you only pay for what you use.

17:20.600 --> 17:23.160
It's just flat $6 for the line.

17:23.160 --> 17:25.960
And then your usage on top of that, you just take your minutes, your message, your megabytes,

17:25.960 --> 17:29.000
whatever bucket you fall into, that's all you have to pay.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.560
That's really super nice.

17:30.560 --> 17:33.520
Because then if you want to have multiple devices for testing applications, or maybe

17:33.520 --> 17:39.240
you have a small business, or maybe like in my case, I have a nanny that is, I can't really

17:39.240 --> 17:41.000
afford to pay for her phone all the time.

17:41.000 --> 17:46.400
But if I only pay for it when she needs it, because some sort of emergency, that is absolutely

17:46.400 --> 17:47.600
worth it for me.

17:47.600 --> 17:52.200
And that's why I love the Ting services based around me and my usage, not my individual

17:52.200 --> 17:55.400
devices, which I think is a superior model to begin with, and they have no whole customer

17:55.400 --> 17:56.400
service.

17:56.400 --> 18:03.040
So if I give the phone to somebody and they have problems, they call Ting at 1-855-TING-FTW,

18:03.040 --> 18:07.400
and a real human being will answer the phone, so I don't have to get stuck doing the troubleshooting.

18:07.400 --> 18:08.920
I really like that.

18:08.920 --> 18:12.940
I just don't want to get tied down helping people with all of the little technical issues.

18:12.940 --> 18:15.800
So the fact that I can hand that off to Ting, they also have a really good help site.

18:15.800 --> 18:19.080
So like in case of Rekai, he doesn't ever have to call in, he'll just go to the Ting

18:19.080 --> 18:21.960
help service, and he can just take care of all his problems that way.

18:21.960 --> 18:24.760
So there's a great range depending on your ability, so it makes it great for a small

18:24.760 --> 18:25.760
business or a family.

18:25.760 --> 18:26.920
I love that.

18:26.920 --> 18:30.840
So go to linux.ting.com, start there to get our special discount.

18:30.840 --> 18:34.320
That'll give you a $50 discount off all of their great devices, and then you can check

18:34.320 --> 18:38.000
out the fact that they have an early termination relief program, so if you're stuck in a stupid

18:38.000 --> 18:41.220
contract right now, they're going to help you get out of that with their ETF program.

18:41.220 --> 18:42.360
Check that out.

18:42.360 --> 18:45.520
And of course, your phone's going to be unlocked, so you're going to get long-term value out

18:45.520 --> 18:46.520
of it.

18:46.520 --> 18:47.520
So here's what you do.

18:47.520 --> 18:50.700
You go to linux.ting.com, check them out.

18:50.700 --> 18:51.700
Also check out their blog.

18:51.700 --> 18:55.800
Like, they just recently posted this video, now this video isn't narrated, but I think

18:55.800 --> 18:57.120
I'm going to do the narration for them right now.

18:57.120 --> 18:58.120
They can just do this for free.

18:58.120 --> 18:59.760
Ting, I'm doing this for you.

18:59.760 --> 19:02.080
So this is a Ting tip, and I'm putting this out here because it's probably good for you

19:02.080 --> 19:04.740
guys to automatically download podcasts over Wi-Fi.

19:04.740 --> 19:09.060
If you're using Pocket Cast, you open up the Pocket Cast app, and then once it's in there,

19:09.060 --> 19:13.080
open up the settings menu, where you go to that little hamburger menu, it slides out,

19:13.080 --> 19:16.680
and then go down into the settings cog at the bottom of that, and then select episode

19:16.680 --> 19:19.360
updates in the app, but it's the second option.

19:19.360 --> 19:23.840
And then in there, there's the option check enabled under auto download, say enabled,

19:23.840 --> 19:27.940
automatically download, and then make sure only on Wi-Fi, so that way, when new episodes

19:27.940 --> 19:30.920
come out, it'll automatically download the new episode, but it won't do it when you're

19:30.920 --> 19:31.920
on cellular.

19:31.920 --> 19:34.760
It's kind of the best of both worlds, so when the new Linux unplugged, hey look, there's

19:34.760 --> 19:36.180
Linux Action Show right there.

19:36.180 --> 19:40.200
When the new Linux Action Show comes out in HD, you don't have to feel guilty about doing

19:40.200 --> 19:43.800
the high download, but you also get it automatically.

19:43.800 --> 19:47.880
That's how I do my Pocket Cast, is I have it set to auto download every show that comes

19:47.880 --> 19:51.360
out, I keep the last two to three episodes, depending on the podcast, and I have it set

19:51.360 --> 19:53.520
to only download when I'm on Wi-Fi.

19:53.520 --> 19:58.160
And so when I'm on the road, I get an idea of what I have coming up, and I could opt

19:58.160 --> 20:01.920
to download over cellular if it's really important to me, and I do sometimes do that, but really

20:01.920 --> 20:05.520
what I do is as soon as I get on my Wi-Fi connection, Pocket Cast just starts pulling

20:05.520 --> 20:09.120
all of them down for me, and the next time I'm on the road, they're ready to go, and

20:09.120 --> 20:14.200
I did not use any wireless data, and so I'm not paying for any wireless data.

20:14.200 --> 20:17.380
And that's just a great way you can, if you're just a little bit technical savvy, just have

20:17.380 --> 20:21.240
a little savviness, you really don't have to have much, you can really leverage the

20:21.240 --> 20:23.380
way the Ting model works and save a ton of money.

20:23.380 --> 20:27.880
So go to linux.ting.com, use that savings calculator, see how much money you'd freaking

20:27.880 --> 20:28.880
save.

20:28.880 --> 20:31.280
I've saved over $2,000.

20:31.280 --> 20:33.760
You can hit the savings calculator and find out how much you would save.

20:33.760 --> 20:38.880
Linux.ting.com, and a big thanks to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

20:38.880 --> 20:42.040
Okay, I have to mention something.

20:42.040 --> 20:46.240
Next week, the Linux Unplugged show is going to be live at 11 a.m. Pacific time, and I

20:46.240 --> 20:48.360
know, you don't know what time that is in your time.

20:48.360 --> 20:51.600
Go to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

20:51.600 --> 20:52.600
You hear that, Popey?

20:52.600 --> 20:53.600
I'm talking to you!

20:53.600 --> 20:58.320
You go to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar to get it converted to your local time, but

20:58.320 --> 21:02.520
yeah, I have some, or I lied, we're doing it at 10 a.m., see, it's a good thing I'm

21:02.520 --> 21:03.520
checking the calendar.

21:03.520 --> 21:04.800
This is why you gotta go to the calendar.

21:04.800 --> 21:09.120
We're doing Linux Unplugged at 10 a.m., so right after Tech Talk next week, it's gonna

21:09.120 --> 21:14.080
go Tech Talk, and then Linux Unplugged on Tuesday next week.

21:14.080 --> 21:17.280
So just a little heads up, we're moving the recording schedule for Linux Unplugged, and

21:17.280 --> 21:20.240
I'm making a big stink about it because the Mumble Room's super important to the show,

21:20.240 --> 21:21.800
and I'd really like to have some people there.

21:21.800 --> 21:22.800
I love you guys.

21:22.800 --> 21:24.940
I love you so much.

21:24.940 --> 21:25.940
So important to me.

21:25.940 --> 21:29.520
So join me at 10 a.m. Pacific for Linux Unplugged next Tuesday.

21:29.520 --> 21:32.640
Just moving it that week because I have some family that's coming to town that I have to

21:32.640 --> 21:36.920
go pick up at the train station, and they're, see, this is what happens when family schedules

21:36.920 --> 21:37.920
stuff.

21:37.920 --> 21:41.760
They literally arrive at 2 p.m. when we would normally be going live.

21:41.760 --> 21:45.240
Like, could they have picked a more perfect time?

21:45.240 --> 21:46.320
I don't think so.

21:46.320 --> 21:50.440
So we're doing 10 a.m. next Tuesday at jblive.tv.

21:50.440 --> 21:51.680
Give us the Eastern time?

21:51.680 --> 21:56.040
Dude, I gave you a website that automatically converts the time zones for you so I can accommodate

21:56.040 --> 21:57.040
everybody.

21:57.040 --> 21:58.440
How much more can I give?

21:58.440 --> 22:00.320
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

22:00.320 --> 22:02.320
Go take advantage of our robots.

22:02.320 --> 22:05.160
After all, I pay them in Bitcoin.

22:05.160 --> 22:06.520
You might as well use them for something.

22:06.520 --> 22:11.440
Okay, well, I'm really excited to welcome back Michael Larabelle from phronix.com.

22:11.440 --> 22:18.280
Michael actually joined us back in 2012, shortly after he'd gotten back from his visit with

22:18.280 --> 22:22.260
Valve and we'd had all the big Steam news for Linux.

22:22.260 --> 22:26.520
And this week, I invited Michael back on the show because he's launched an initiative that

22:26.520 --> 22:28.880
I think is pretty interesting.

22:28.880 --> 22:31.640
And I want to see if I'm grokking this right, Michael, so I'm going to run it past you.

22:31.640 --> 22:33.360
Tell me if I've captured this right.

22:33.360 --> 22:37.480
But it looks like you're kind of taking all of the work you've done with the Phronix Benchmarking

22:37.480 --> 22:42.880
Suite, all of your experience you have with benchmarking for Phronix website and the Open

22:42.880 --> 22:48.280
Benchmark project, and you are launching an automated testing site that essentially will

22:48.280 --> 22:52.780
be monitoring some of the most popular open source projects and trending their performance

22:52.780 --> 22:54.520
impact over time.

22:54.520 --> 22:56.000
Am I kind of grokking this?

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
Hi, Chris.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.120
Yes, you're mostly correct.

22:59.120 --> 23:03.680
It's basically to monitor the performance over time of important projects like the Linux

23:03.680 --> 23:09.400
kernel, the GCC compiler, LLVM and Clang, and then I've also been working on some other

23:09.400 --> 23:15.440
trackers for all the latest R-Clinix packages in real time and everything else like that.

23:15.440 --> 23:20.280
And you're doing these testing and the results on a daily basis, correct?

23:20.280 --> 23:21.280
Correct.

23:21.280 --> 23:25.560
The majority of the trackers right now are running on a daily time basis, but there's

23:25.560 --> 23:29.700
also the ability within the Phronix test suite to do per-commit testing, so basically whenever

23:29.700 --> 23:34.000
there's a new get revision that the triggers would automatically fire off the new round

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
of testing.

23:35.000 --> 23:39.160
But for my testing over the past several months, I've just found the daily testing to be best

23:39.160 --> 23:44.480
off rather than having so many triggers per day of kernel benchmarking when each kernel

23:44.480 --> 23:48.120
benchmark will end up taking several hours per system, etc.

23:48.120 --> 23:55.360
So first of all, I got to say, if I'm following you correctly, this sounds like a massive

23:55.360 --> 23:56.880
sacrifice of your man cave.

23:56.880 --> 24:03.280
I just finished remodeling the basement and I basically devoted it entirely to this linuxbenchmarking.com

24:03.280 --> 24:04.280
testing.

24:04.280 --> 24:05.960
I'm seeing that.

24:05.960 --> 24:09.520
It looks like it was at one point going to be a very nice theater with a bar and a projector

24:09.520 --> 24:15.880
and a bench seat, and it looks like it's now dedicated to a server farm for doing benchmarks.

24:15.880 --> 24:20.640
Beforehand, there are some pictures on one of the older Phronix articles that's linked

24:20.640 --> 24:24.280
from linuxbenchmarking.com, but it was just like a complete wreck in the basement.

24:24.280 --> 24:28.640
I actually just added the bar just because of whenever there's Phronix test suite customers

24:28.640 --> 24:32.800
over here and then the projector is just nice for seeing the real time status of all the

24:32.800 --> 24:33.800
systems running.

24:33.800 --> 24:34.800
Oh, I love it.

24:34.800 --> 24:37.680
So the bar is for the benchmarking.

24:37.680 --> 24:39.520
Oh, that is so cool.

24:39.520 --> 24:40.520
That is way cooler.

24:40.520 --> 24:44.400
I thought it was like some sort of sad sacrifice and instead it is actually way more badass

24:44.400 --> 24:45.400
than that.

24:45.400 --> 24:46.960
You have a bar in your benchmarking suite.

24:46.960 --> 24:49.720
That is really cool.

24:49.720 --> 24:55.800
So you say when customers come over, what kind of customers come over for the Phronix

24:55.800 --> 24:56.800
benchmarking suite?

24:56.800 --> 24:57.800
Is it like hardware manufacturers?

24:57.800 --> 25:01.360
Can you give me a picture of what that's like because that's an area of your business that

25:01.360 --> 25:03.480
I don't have any insights on at all.

25:03.480 --> 25:07.760
Yeah, it's basically for any enterprise customers for the Phronix test suite that either want

25:07.760 --> 25:16.640
customizations done for the PTS or openbenchmarking.org to better suit their roles and whatnot.

25:16.640 --> 25:21.000
One customer that's able to be talked about publicly is actually GE that sponsored much

25:21.000 --> 25:25.880
of this recent work which in turn led to the linuxbenchmarking.com is where they were rolling

25:25.880 --> 25:29.800
out thousands of servers where they run benchmarks every day entirely powered by the Phronix

25:29.800 --> 25:32.420
test suite and Floramatic.

25:32.420 --> 25:36.440
So I'm sure for them and also really for the community in general, JB Hawke of Truth in

25:36.440 --> 25:41.200
our chat room asked a great question and this is something that whenever you talk about

25:41.200 --> 25:45.020
benchmarks, people always will try to poke holes in how the benchmark is constructed

25:45.020 --> 25:46.720
or how it's ran.

25:46.720 --> 25:50.320
So JB Hawke of Truth in our chat room says, could you give us an idea of who maintains

25:50.320 --> 25:53.460
the test cases used to measure the target application?

25:53.460 --> 25:55.000
Is that something you maintain?

25:55.000 --> 25:59.500
Or is that like an open source project sort of like where different people are contributing

25:59.500 --> 26:00.760
to that?

26:00.760 --> 26:04.080
Do people add their own metrics from different projects?

26:04.080 --> 26:06.200
How is that driven?

26:06.200 --> 26:10.520
It's all powered by the Phronix test suite which in turn pulls it from our openbenchmarking.org

26:10.520 --> 26:14.920
website that basically acts as a repository for all the test cases.

26:14.920 --> 26:19.760
All those test cases are basically comprised of work that's done either by me or many other

26:19.760 --> 26:20.760
contributors.

26:20.760 --> 26:24.280
There's everything from like code weavers, they've submitted like wine test profiles

26:24.280 --> 26:25.280
for measuring that.

26:25.280 --> 26:30.240
And yeah, it's basically an open project and not anyone's able to recommend any new test

26:30.240 --> 26:34.720
cases or adapt their test cases and upload them where the test profiles for the Phronix

26:34.720 --> 26:37.840
test suite are just basically a few bash scripts and XML files.

26:37.840 --> 26:38.840
Right.

26:38.840 --> 26:39.840
I see.

26:39.840 --> 26:40.840
Yeah.

26:40.840 --> 26:45.400
And we've also uploaded like popular audio encoding tests to the open benchmarking site.

26:45.400 --> 26:49.640
And so if I, for example, in Jupyter Broadcasting, if we developed a benchmark maybe for like

26:49.640 --> 26:55.840
FFmpeg encoding setups, we could essentially upload like an FFmpeg benchmarking script

26:55.840 --> 26:59.040
test suite and then if the community liked it and it got popular, then it would sort

26:59.040 --> 27:00.040
of become a well-known.

27:00.040 --> 27:01.040
Is that how it works?

27:01.040 --> 27:02.040
Yes, indeed.

27:02.040 --> 27:03.040
That's correct.

27:03.040 --> 27:09.240
And though actually there is already FFmpeg benchmarking there, yeah, basically anyone

27:09.240 --> 27:14.240
can submit new test profiles and from there it rolls out to anyone that's doing a public

27:14.240 --> 27:19.760
or private deployment of the Phronix test suite, including linuxbenchmarking.com, which

27:19.760 --> 27:27.160
is different than all the other tests, well, to back up a few steps, like Red Hat, Canonical

27:27.160 --> 27:32.520
and others also maintain their own benchmarks against the latest Linux kernel and whatnot.

27:32.520 --> 27:36.360
But yeah, their test cases are often limited without any intervention and they're also

27:36.360 --> 27:41.480
often focused just around their use cases of like Apache web server performance or other

27:41.480 --> 27:47.160
scientific areas rather than say running Linux gaming benchmark since the Linux gaming benchmarks

27:47.160 --> 27:51.600
or Linux gaming customers aren't what leads to lots of their revenue.

27:51.600 --> 27:52.600
Is that a fan behind you, I hear?

27:52.600 --> 27:57.600
I guess actually just one of those servers that was just rebooting because it's now getting

27:57.600 --> 28:00.200
ready for its new round of testing.

28:00.200 --> 28:02.360
Yeah, that is exactly what I thought it was.

28:02.360 --> 28:05.440
Man, those things are just banshees when you reboot them.

28:05.440 --> 28:12.360
So when I look at this, I think daily GCC benchmarks, daily Linux kernel benchmarks,

28:12.360 --> 28:13.960
what's driving you to do this?

28:13.960 --> 28:15.320
What's the core reason?

28:15.320 --> 28:19.240
What is the core benefit of making this information public and putting it out there like this?

28:19.240 --> 28:23.340
Why not keep it some secret sauce you can use for special Phronix reports and things

28:23.340 --> 28:24.340
like that?

28:24.340 --> 28:29.040
It's mostly just being dissatisfied over all these years with how many regressions

28:29.040 --> 28:33.240
still enter mainly the Linux kernel, but yeah, there's also regressions in many other projects

28:33.240 --> 28:40.280
out there that there just isn't too much action being done about any upstream latest git trying

28:40.280 --> 28:47.040
to be universal benchmarking because besides Red Hat not caring about gaming benchmarks,

28:47.040 --> 28:50.680
they and other distribution vendors often just care about testing the kernels they're

28:50.680 --> 28:55.240
going to ship in their next product as opposed to the very latest git code.

28:55.240 --> 28:56.240
Right.

28:56.240 --> 29:02.600
And so I feel like you touched on something that I have noticed is an undercurrent, an

29:02.600 --> 29:05.360
undertone in your writing.

29:05.360 --> 29:11.760
You I get the sense really hate regressions and you I think in some ways are driven to

29:11.760 --> 29:18.360
find when regressions happen and point that out based on data to the best of your ability.

29:18.360 --> 29:23.000
Do you feel finding regressions and helping people fix them, identify them, is that part

29:23.000 --> 29:25.560
of what drives you to do all this benchmarking and do all of this?

29:25.560 --> 29:27.520
Are you a regression hater?

29:27.520 --> 29:33.940
I mostly just hate regressions, yes, but I'm just really interested in Linux hardware and

29:33.940 --> 29:38.400
trying to ensure everything achieves their peak performance possible in your Linux.

29:38.400 --> 29:40.640
This is the disconnect that I don't get.

29:40.640 --> 29:45.040
So how does it not seems like then you would be in a position where you would be constantly

29:45.040 --> 29:48.760
tormented because you're going to see regressions everywhere because that happens in software

29:48.760 --> 29:52.640
development and they're right there out there for everybody to see an open source, but also

29:52.640 --> 29:53.640
you've run the numbers.

29:53.640 --> 29:58.040
A lot of times you can run the same benchmark for say an open GL application or a game and

29:58.040 --> 30:01.560
get a much better result using a proprietary driver on Windows than you might get with

30:01.560 --> 30:02.780
a proprietary driver on Linux.

30:02.780 --> 30:08.280
So how does somebody who's constantly checking for the best performance and who has a little

30:08.280 --> 30:11.760
bit of regression hate, how do you not just get frustrated with Linux?

30:11.760 --> 30:16.300
Here you are almost 11 years into Ferronix, I would think by now you would have pulled

30:16.300 --> 30:17.300
your hair out.

30:17.300 --> 30:22.480
I've pulled plenty of hair out, but overall Linux performance is still pretty much on

30:22.480 --> 30:24.400
par with Windows.

30:24.400 --> 30:29.360
There's certainly some cases where it's not, but it's improving a lot and it is frustrating

30:29.360 --> 30:33.440
though when you see such performance drives being made and then all of a sudden on the

30:33.440 --> 30:39.080
next kernel release you see your battery power usage just go horribly and no one notices

30:39.080 --> 30:41.240
it until after the kernel ships.

30:41.240 --> 30:46.320
Yeah, I've always wondered when I'm reading that.

30:46.320 --> 30:51.520
And so I think now with these benchmarks, I look at this and I think, I wonder if maybe

30:51.520 --> 30:55.600
it's time to sort of try to incorporate these kinds of benchmarks into reviews even.

30:55.600 --> 30:59.800
Do you see the possibility there for, where do you really see this going?

30:59.800 --> 31:04.960
Do you see it more for hardware makers and big projects or do you see it more as more

31:04.960 --> 31:06.280
used by the community?

31:06.280 --> 31:07.280
Where do you see it going?

31:07.280 --> 31:10.880
Is it more of a community effort or more of an enterprise effort?

31:10.880 --> 31:15.160
In terms of linuxbenchmarking.com, it's a community effort, but with the Ferronix SysWee

31:15.160 --> 31:21.160
Informatic, anyone is able to test out their own software on their own hardware and everything

31:21.160 --> 31:22.160
along those lines.

31:22.160 --> 31:25.960
And there's plenty of behind the firewall for automatic deployments for running all

31:25.960 --> 31:31.640
these benchmarks that various companies use, but yes, for linuxbenchmarking.com it's mostly

31:31.640 --> 31:35.360
just a community effort because I have to test out my latest code anyways that I'm shipping

31:35.360 --> 31:36.920
to customers.

31:36.920 --> 31:41.560
So I'm basically making all that data public and trying to be as most real world and applicable

31:41.560 --> 31:45.520
to the community as possible and all this data that I have to produce anyways.

31:45.520 --> 31:49.940
Well Michael, before we wrap up, I'm just curious, obviously you follow the Linux news

31:49.940 --> 31:56.120
pretty closely, like big picture wise, what's going on out there in the last six months

31:56.120 --> 32:02.160
or so or whatever that you find to be particularly interesting?

32:02.160 --> 32:03.160
That's a very good question.

32:03.160 --> 32:06.160
There's many things that's interesting to me right now.

32:06.160 --> 32:12.540
LLVM and Clang continue to be quite interesting, particularly for how they're being adapted

32:12.540 --> 32:18.880
by so many different projects and now with Vulkan as basically the next generation OpenGL,

32:18.880 --> 32:24.600
but there's going to be the Sphere V2 LLVM converters, all these other LLVM based products

32:24.600 --> 32:28.120
will now be able to easily interact with the GPU.

32:28.120 --> 32:32.600
That's one interesting area that always excites me over the past few years.

32:32.600 --> 32:35.960
Bluetooth Snappy tends to be a little bit interesting, I still have to read up a lot

32:35.960 --> 32:41.360
more on it, but they have a lot of nice plans.

32:41.360 --> 32:47.760
I've noticed too, you seem like a close follower of the Fedora project as well, what do you

32:47.760 --> 32:49.040
think about where Fedora is going?

32:49.040 --> 32:51.040
We're going to talk about Fedora 22 today.

32:51.040 --> 32:55.560
I'm quite happy with Fedora 22 and Fedora 21 for that matter.

32:55.560 --> 33:00.640
I've had Fedora 22 on a couple dozen systems now and it's running fairly nicely.

33:00.640 --> 33:06.360
I've had that Nuovo regression that's a bit annoying, and the other day I had an issue

33:06.360 --> 33:10.800
with the WiFi where I'm getting really awkward internet connection speeds out of it, but

33:10.800 --> 33:15.760
aside from that Fedora 22 has been performing very nicely and it's quite stable.

33:15.760 --> 33:20.680
I've tested it both under X11 and Wayland, and the Wayland experience has been pretty

33:20.680 --> 33:22.800
much on par now with X11.

33:22.800 --> 33:27.660
That's going to be a big story, and I could see a specific angle there for your site too.

33:27.660 --> 33:31.140
As Wayland rolls out and more distributions start shipping it, there's going to be lots

33:31.140 --> 33:34.280
of performance regressions, there's going to be lots of new territory there.

33:34.280 --> 33:36.200
That's got to be a story you follow with some interest.

33:36.200 --> 33:40.980
Yes, certainly, overall the performance under Wayland or X-Wayland for that matter is pretty

33:40.980 --> 33:46.400
nice with X-Wayland right now on the gnome shell there's some issues just around full

33:46.400 --> 33:52.240
screen apps not being redirected properly, so there's a performance penalty, but at least

33:52.240 --> 33:57.280
according to the developers that should be fixed in due time, so there isn't anything

33:57.280 --> 33:58.280
too major.

33:58.280 --> 34:02.960
It's not like you're suddenly having the performance in half, it's just that it's down 10% or so.

34:02.960 --> 34:04.800
I love that's where we're at.

34:04.800 --> 34:05.800
That's great.

34:05.800 --> 34:08.400
That's better than you might expect, I suppose.

34:08.400 --> 34:13.680
Heaven's Revenge wanted to ask you a question, Michael, go ahead Heaven's, ask away.

34:13.680 --> 34:20.680
Well with the new release of Clang 3.6 and LLVM 3.6, have you tried out the OpenMP support

34:20.680 --> 34:26.520
as I have, and have running on my system using a few test programs, so do you have any benchmarks

34:26.520 --> 34:29.120
coming up with the OpenMP support for Clang?

34:29.120 --> 34:37.240
Yes, I will, a few months ago I did run some of Intel's OpenMP branch of LLVM and Clang,

34:37.240 --> 34:41.200
and then now that everything is settling in Mayline, I am in the process of this week

34:41.200 --> 34:45.240
running some new benchmarks, and we'll have those out either this week or next week.

34:45.240 --> 34:49.080
That's one thing I'm so excited for, and I'm very relieved that they finally have it merged

34:49.080 --> 34:50.080
into their master branch.

34:50.080 --> 34:58.360
Yeah, it's very great, and then on LinuxBenchmarking.com is the latest LLVM and Clang benchmark results,

34:58.360 --> 35:02.000
and just yesterday I updated the test scripts to make sure that it's installing the latest

35:02.000 --> 35:06.120
OpenMP runtime libraries, so within the next day or two you might be able to see those

35:06.120 --> 35:12.320
results for that dozen or so systems organically switch over to the OpenMP support.

35:12.320 --> 35:13.320
That's really cool.

35:13.320 --> 35:15.280
Derek Delvin, you had a question you wanted to ask, Michael.

35:15.280 --> 35:16.280
Indeed.

35:16.280 --> 35:23.600
I'd like to know what are the kinds of features that you would like to see coming to the kernel

35:23.600 --> 35:31.040
so that it will help you better test and do what you usually do, because I'm interested

35:31.040 --> 35:32.040
in that.

35:32.040 --> 35:38.040
There isn't any one feature that I'd like right now, like the tracing features in the

35:38.040 --> 35:40.320
kernel are going nicely and everything else.

35:40.320 --> 35:45.840
It would be nice if there was some universally expected benchmark flag for the kernel and

35:45.840 --> 35:47.920
user space that people would expect.

35:47.920 --> 35:52.360
Like right now, between the different Linux graphics drivers for X11, they all have a

35:52.360 --> 35:55.400
different option for how to disable basically vblank.

35:55.400 --> 35:59.320
There's no standardized way of doing that, and of course you want to disable vblank,

35:59.320 --> 36:03.280
but within the Fronix test suite and my scripts, I have to make sure that it accommodates every

36:03.280 --> 36:08.480
driver and make sure it checks or not, and then writes to their proper name and whatnot.

36:08.480 --> 36:14.360
There's no simple universal way to say, hey, we're going to benchmark, so basically make

36:14.360 --> 36:17.960
it in performant mode.

36:17.960 --> 36:18.960
That makes sense.

36:18.960 --> 36:23.360
So, Michael, my last question for you came from Corky in the chat room, and just kind

36:23.360 --> 36:25.760
of curious, what is your main daily Linux driver?

36:25.760 --> 36:26.760
What is your setup?

36:26.760 --> 36:28.960
What distro and what's it look like?

36:28.960 --> 36:30.680
My distro right now is Fedora 21.

36:30.680 --> 36:34.920
I'll upgrade to Fedora 22 in the next few days or a couple of weeks after I find out

36:34.920 --> 36:40.280
if FedUp is working nicely since I know when Fedora 21 rolled out that FedUp had some issues.

36:40.280 --> 36:44.000
So once I can be comfortable upgrading that, I'll do that.

36:44.000 --> 36:48.720
On my main production system, I'm using Intel Haswell, or actually I know it's already

36:48.720 --> 36:53.880
Broadwell, Ultrabook, and that's basically just using that driver since I'm not running

36:53.880 --> 36:58.880
any games or anything graphically intensive on that system, and I can generally rely upon

36:58.880 --> 37:03.840
the Intel graphics driver to not give me any regressions for mode setting and other key

37:03.840 --> 37:05.680
functionality between the kernel releases.

37:05.680 --> 37:06.680
Yeah.

37:06.680 --> 37:07.680
Yeah.

37:07.680 --> 37:10.840
When you can get by with the open source driver, it does make it really nice.

37:10.840 --> 37:15.720
I ran into a snag in Fedora 22 that I'll talk about in our review in a little bit, but yeah,

37:15.720 --> 37:20.600
that was one little snafu for me, but other than that, yeah, the open source driver, if

37:20.600 --> 37:24.400
you're not gaming, I can't believe where it's at now.

37:24.400 --> 37:31.200
Really between that and the Intel stuff, looking back at 11 years of this stuff, it has come

37:31.200 --> 37:32.200
so far.

37:32.200 --> 37:36.440
Just looking at the nine years we've been doing the Linux action show, it is fundamentally

37:36.440 --> 37:37.440
different.

37:37.440 --> 37:40.280
Listen to that discussion we had earlier about how you set up Mandrake to where it's at now

37:40.280 --> 37:41.280
with these open source drivers.

37:41.280 --> 37:42.280
It blows my mind.

37:42.280 --> 37:43.280
Oh, right.

37:43.280 --> 37:44.280
Yeah.

37:44.280 --> 37:47.840
I had a lot of fun reminiscing over that with the Mandrake sex config.

37:47.840 --> 37:48.840
Yes.

37:48.840 --> 37:49.840
Yeah.

37:49.840 --> 37:50.840
Yeah, yeah.

37:50.840 --> 37:53.640
Well, Michael, thanks so much for coming on and updating us.

37:53.640 --> 37:56.520
Great initiative here, and folks, I want you to go check it out.

37:56.520 --> 37:59.920
It's really cool, and we'll have links to all of it in the show notes.

37:59.920 --> 38:01.920
It's linuxbenchmarking.com, right, Michael?

38:01.920 --> 38:06.840
Yes, that's correct, but I also have linuxbenchmark.com, and pretty much any other variety should also

38:06.840 --> 38:07.840
redirect there.

38:07.840 --> 38:08.840
Nice score.

38:08.840 --> 38:09.840
No worries.

38:09.840 --> 38:10.840
Wow, that's a good score.

38:10.840 --> 38:14.360
That is some prime real estate right there.

38:14.360 --> 38:16.080
You keep it up, and I'll be watching that.

38:16.080 --> 38:19.840
I'm curious to see after you've been publishing these results for a while to see what kind

38:19.840 --> 38:23.920
of trends show up and things like that, especially in some of our favorite projects.

38:23.920 --> 38:26.260
And Michael, of course, you are always welcome to join us.

38:26.260 --> 38:29.680
We have an open Mamba room, and you can stick around for the rest of the show if you'd like.

38:29.680 --> 38:35.040
We're going to get into taking care of some little bit more transitions to Linux.

38:35.040 --> 38:40.200
I tried to solve some issues for Angela and her Switch that really came down to compatibility

38:40.200 --> 38:41.200
issues.

38:41.200 --> 38:42.200
I'm going to talk about what I did and how they worked.

38:42.200 --> 38:46.360
I've tried a couple of different suites, including Kingsoft, a different file format than Office

38:46.360 --> 38:48.580
365.

38:48.580 --> 38:52.160
And I tried to go all in when I did Office 365, integrate it into our desktop, give her

38:52.160 --> 38:54.480
a dock icon, make it feel like a true Excel experience.

38:54.480 --> 38:57.440
I'm going to tell you all about that here in a second, and then we're going to get into

38:57.440 --> 39:01.200
our Fedora 22 review, which I'm really excited to talk about.

39:01.200 --> 39:04.120
First, I've got to tell you something I'm super passionate about, and that's Digital

39:04.120 --> 39:06.920
Ocean, the next sponsor of the Linux Unplugged program.

39:06.920 --> 39:07.920
What?

39:07.920 --> 39:10.120
You don't know what Digital Ocean is?

39:10.120 --> 39:12.760
Digital Ocean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and

39:12.760 --> 39:15.500
easy way for you to spin up your own cloud server up in the sky.

39:15.500 --> 39:18.780
You need root access on a box that's super fast, connected to tier one bandwidth based

39:18.780 --> 39:19.780
on Linux.

39:19.780 --> 39:22.480
All SSDs throughout, that's Digital Ocean, and the value is incredible.

39:22.480 --> 39:24.240
You're going to get a root console.

39:24.240 --> 39:27.920
You can go right up to that website, HTML5, Badmama, Jamma, Written in Go, you can watch

39:27.920 --> 39:31.060
that thing from post all the way up to the login screen, and you can get your droplet

39:31.060 --> 39:33.500
created in less than 55 seconds.

39:33.500 --> 39:41.880
And pricing plans start at only $5 a month, a month, $5 a month for 512 megabytes of RAM,

39:41.880 --> 39:49.560
a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU, and a terabyte, a terabyte, a terabyte of transfer for $5

39:49.560 --> 39:50.800
a month.

39:50.800 --> 39:54.080
Like when it's that price, it's obvious why I have four of them, isn't it?

39:54.080 --> 39:56.180
I mean, come on, hello, it's nuts.

39:56.180 --> 39:59.760
And they have data centers in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, Germany,

39:59.760 --> 40:00.760
and London.

40:00.760 --> 40:01.760
That one in Germany is brand new.

40:01.760 --> 40:02.760
It's super hot.

40:02.760 --> 40:04.080
They got great connectivity to all their neighbors.

40:04.080 --> 40:08.680
The individual hypervisors have 40 gigabit E connections, the fastest SSDs they've ever

40:08.680 --> 40:09.680
deployed.

40:09.680 --> 40:12.640
You don't even have to put a droplet over there because it just sounds so dang fancy.

40:12.640 --> 40:13.640
Seriously.

40:13.640 --> 40:17.600
Plus, you know, help out our folks over in that neck of the woods, too.

40:17.600 --> 40:20.080
But let's talk about how you manage DigitalOcean.

40:20.080 --> 40:24.320
Because yeah, you know, 55 seconds is pretty badass, and the value is amazing, and the

40:24.320 --> 40:27.120
fact that it's all based on Linux and KVM is super killer, and the fact that they have

40:27.120 --> 40:29.840
great data centers everywhere is obviously essential.

40:29.840 --> 40:34.720
But it's that icing on top of that cake, let's not lie, we all like that icing, and that's

40:34.720 --> 40:36.360
DigitalOcean's interface.

40:36.360 --> 40:40.480
Their simple intuitive control panel kicks butt, and PowerU is going to replicate it

40:40.480 --> 40:45.320
on a much larger scale with DigitalOcean's straightforward API that they just revved.

40:45.320 --> 40:48.600
Brand new revision of the API, and I love hearing about how you guys take advantage

40:48.600 --> 40:51.000
of these APIs, and there's a ton of amazing applications.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
You know what?

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
You know what?

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
I got to go look at some of these apps.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.560
So here, go over to DigitalOcean.com right now, remember our code DOUNPLUGGED, and then

40:56.560 --> 41:01.720
click on that community link right there, and then go over to the project section.

41:01.720 --> 41:05.180
And when you're in the project section, look at all of these freaking amazing applications

41:05.180 --> 41:09.740
written around the DigitalOcean API that you just get for being up on DigitalOcean.

41:09.740 --> 41:15.120
There are so many really awesome apps that make using DigitalOcean blow your mind, like

41:15.120 --> 41:19.160
stuff where you can just do incredible things from your phone, snap it right into your puppet

41:19.160 --> 41:22.760
management infrastructure, your vagrant infrastructure, use Drizzle with it.

41:22.760 --> 41:25.440
They have so many great little indicators for your desktops.

41:25.440 --> 41:26.800
There's one in the Arch repository.

41:26.800 --> 41:28.960
There's a PPA for the Ubuntu desktop.

41:28.960 --> 41:32.920
So many cool tools built by the community around this API that you just get for free.

41:32.920 --> 41:36.640
And then they have a ton of really great tutorials, I mean, not just great, the best tutorials

41:36.640 --> 41:41.440
on the web, how to set up SSH keys, how to set up open VPN server on Ubuntu 14.04, all

41:41.440 --> 41:43.480
free, all up on the DigitalOcean website.

41:43.480 --> 41:44.480
And you know what else?

41:44.480 --> 41:45.700
They want to double down on that.

41:45.700 --> 41:47.000
So they're hiring content editors.

41:47.000 --> 41:50.220
In fact, if you're a technical writer, go get a job at DigitalOcean, because they're

41:50.220 --> 41:51.920
serious about this stuff.

41:51.920 --> 41:54.760
And this is the kind of company you want to work for, where they really see the value

41:54.760 --> 41:55.900
in this kind of content.

41:55.900 --> 41:58.720
So they're hiring editors, and they're paying people to write for them too.

41:58.720 --> 41:59.720
They're back at it again.

41:59.720 --> 42:00.880
They're taking more entries.

42:00.880 --> 42:01.880
Go check it out.

42:01.880 --> 42:03.200
They're a Linux sysadmin.

42:03.200 --> 42:04.660
They're also hiring those.

42:04.660 --> 42:07.240
So there's so many great opportunities over DigitalOcean.

42:07.240 --> 42:10.000
They're an awesome company, built their entire business around Linux.

42:10.000 --> 42:14.240
And if you use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED, one word lowercase, you'll get a $10 credit

42:14.240 --> 42:16.300
tryout, that $5 rig, two months for free.

42:16.300 --> 42:17.900
You guys, it's crazy nuts.

42:17.900 --> 42:18.900
It's so much fun.

42:18.900 --> 42:19.900
They're super fast.

42:19.900 --> 42:20.900
They have local repos.

42:20.900 --> 42:21.900
So those updates, they blow your mind.

42:21.900 --> 42:22.900
I'm not even kidding.

42:22.900 --> 42:23.900
Go try it out.

42:23.900 --> 42:25.600
Go create a droplet and install the updates.

42:25.600 --> 42:26.600
That alone will blow your mind.

42:26.600 --> 42:29.280
DigitalOcean.com, DOUNPLUGGED, go create something cool.

42:29.280 --> 42:31.920
My last droplet was a Minecraft server for my wife and son.

42:31.920 --> 42:33.420
They fricking love it.

42:33.420 --> 42:36.240
And before they do something crazy, I just take a snapshot.

42:36.240 --> 42:39.680
It's all possible with a straightforward, super simple interface.

42:39.680 --> 42:42.560
DigitalOcean.com, promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

42:42.560 --> 42:46.160
And a huge thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program.

42:46.160 --> 42:47.600
You guys rock.

42:47.600 --> 42:49.040
You're on fire.

42:49.040 --> 42:50.040
Love it.

42:50.040 --> 42:51.040
DigitalOcean.com, DOUNPLUGGED.

42:51.040 --> 42:53.720
You guys are wrecking it up.

42:53.720 --> 42:54.720
Okay, Noah.

42:54.720 --> 42:59.360
So, Ange came to me and she said, honey, I can't pay the bills.

42:59.360 --> 43:02.680
And that wasn't a good thing to hear from the wife.

43:02.680 --> 43:04.520
And it's this damn Linux.

43:04.520 --> 43:07.960
And you never want to hear this when you're trying to switch a new user over to Linux.

43:07.960 --> 43:14.340
So the problem was is she had a pretty fancy spreadsheet that she created in a newer version

43:14.340 --> 43:15.340
of Excel.

43:15.340 --> 43:19.320
It was a.xls file, xl, xlsx.

43:19.320 --> 43:21.440
And this is like an imitation of LibreOfficeCoke?

43:21.440 --> 43:22.440
Yeah.

43:22.440 --> 43:25.640
And basically it's like a knockoff, but they've sort of messed up the UI really bad, so it's

43:25.640 --> 43:26.640
hard to use.

43:26.640 --> 43:27.640
I don't know if you've seen this.

43:27.640 --> 43:28.640
I see.

43:28.640 --> 43:30.000
They just have these huge buttons across the top.

43:30.000 --> 43:31.520
And it's more recent.

43:31.520 --> 43:39.380
And the other thing is, this is really weird, but it's like this standalone binary application.

43:39.380 --> 43:41.240
It's not available in any repo.

43:41.240 --> 43:44.160
And you have to buy it directly from this Microsoft company.

43:44.160 --> 43:48.040
And then you can download it, but you have to run this weird proprietary installer that

43:48.040 --> 43:50.120
doesn't add it to your package repo.

43:50.120 --> 43:51.120
Really?

43:51.120 --> 43:52.620
And they're not even Linux executables.

43:52.620 --> 43:53.800
So that was a huge way.

43:53.800 --> 43:54.800
So that didn't work out.

43:54.800 --> 43:58.040
I couldn't go in with Microsoft Office.

43:58.040 --> 43:59.040
But then...

43:59.040 --> 44:00.040
It sounds like that company's out of touch with reality.

44:00.040 --> 44:01.040
I know, right?

44:01.040 --> 44:06.000
Well, then I found out they're trying this new thing called Office 365, an online version

44:06.000 --> 44:08.040
of Microsoft Office.

44:08.040 --> 44:09.680
So like a ripoff of Google Docs.

44:09.680 --> 44:10.680
Right.

44:10.680 --> 44:14.640
Actually, so I went for the business essentials, because I'm a business, and I had business

44:14.640 --> 44:15.640
to take care of.

44:15.640 --> 44:20.000
So it's $5 a month or about like $60 if you buy it for a year or something like that.

44:20.000 --> 44:24.360
And I'm thinking, I'm getting this for her, because you know what, I want to stay on Linux.

44:24.360 --> 44:29.000
And if the price I have to pay is $60, so that way she gets access to Office, then I

44:29.000 --> 44:30.560
never have to worry about this again.

44:30.560 --> 44:31.560
Right?

44:31.560 --> 44:32.560
That's...

44:32.560 --> 44:33.560
It's worth five times that.

44:33.560 --> 44:34.560
Yeah, right?

44:34.560 --> 44:35.560
Right.

44:35.560 --> 44:36.560
That's what I was thinking.

44:36.560 --> 44:37.560
That's exactly what I was thinking.

44:37.560 --> 44:40.680
Then I discovered when you pay $5 a month, you don't just get like Google Docs and Google

44:40.680 --> 44:41.680
Spreadsheets.

44:41.680 --> 44:42.680
Like that's all I wanted for $5 a month.

44:42.680 --> 44:45.040
In fact, I didn't want anything more than that.

44:45.040 --> 44:49.440
You get like the entire Microsoft business enterprise suite.

44:49.440 --> 44:51.440
You get like Active Directory on demand.

44:51.440 --> 44:52.500
You get Exchange.

44:52.500 --> 44:53.920
You get MobileSync.

44:53.920 --> 44:55.840
You get provisioning of user accounts.

44:55.840 --> 44:57.960
You get calendaring, groupware.

44:57.960 --> 45:00.040
You get shared OneDrive storage.

45:00.040 --> 45:02.400
You get your own customized domain for all of it.

45:02.400 --> 45:03.880
You can do branding with all of it.

45:03.880 --> 45:09.080
Like it is this massive, total, overarching competitor to Google Apps for business.

45:09.080 --> 45:11.480
It is a beast of a service.

45:11.480 --> 45:12.880
And she has every...

45:12.880 --> 45:14.940
She has her own Exchange server now.

45:14.940 --> 45:15.940
Like every...

45:15.940 --> 45:18.840
So you don't just get Office, which was a little intense.

45:18.840 --> 45:26.520
It was more than I really wanted, but nonetheless, I log in and I discover that you can't upload,

45:26.520 --> 45:32.000
at least from what I could tell, you can't upload into Excel from the local file system.

45:32.000 --> 45:37.760
The only way to open up an existing document in Word or Excel online is to either import

45:37.760 --> 45:40.200
it from Dropbox or to open it off of OneDrive.

45:40.200 --> 45:41.200
Yeah.

45:41.200 --> 45:44.120
I was going to say, I think that is their prescribed method, right?

45:44.120 --> 45:49.000
Put the document into OneDrive and then you can access it through the...

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
Yeah.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
But you see the slippery slope I'm on.

45:51.000 --> 45:54.400
So I go from, I'd like my wife to be able to open up the spreadsheet to now my wife

45:54.400 --> 45:55.640
is a OneDrive user.

45:55.640 --> 45:57.480
She's uploading files to OneDrive.

45:57.480 --> 45:59.120
She's importing them into Excel.

45:59.120 --> 46:02.080
Like it's just this slippery lock-in slope.

46:02.080 --> 46:07.160
So to be clear, so your expectation was that she would have the file locally, but able

46:07.160 --> 46:09.520
to edit it and manipulate it in the...

46:09.520 --> 46:10.520
I guess because...

46:10.520 --> 46:11.520
I feel like that's a little unrealistic.

46:11.520 --> 46:14.920
Yeah, because in Google Docs, you can upload a file directly into Google Docs and yes,

46:14.920 --> 46:18.560
then it's stored in Google Drive, but I don't know.

46:18.560 --> 46:21.360
So it's semantics then at that point, you're uploading it to OneDrive or you're uploading

46:21.360 --> 46:22.360
it to Office 365.

46:22.360 --> 46:25.640
But for her, the semantics matter because you have to upload to OneDrive first.

46:25.640 --> 46:30.200
So from a user perspective, you have to go to the OneDrive area, upload a file, and then

46:30.200 --> 46:31.200
you can...

46:31.200 --> 46:36.720
But in theory, you should spend maybe 10 minutes picking files that she needs to use and put

46:36.720 --> 46:37.720
those up.

46:37.720 --> 46:39.840
And then once they're there, you should never need to pull them back down.

46:39.840 --> 46:41.760
Everything should just remain there and you edit them, right?

46:41.760 --> 46:42.760
Yeah, I think so.

46:42.760 --> 46:46.760
And if you ever create a new document, it's always going to automatically be saved in

46:46.760 --> 46:47.760
OneDrive.

46:47.760 --> 46:48.760
Yes, that's true.

46:48.760 --> 46:50.280
But see, then this is also what I'm concerned about.

46:50.280 --> 46:53.040
See, I was hoping she'd be able to download them locally and save them in our own cloud

46:53.040 --> 46:54.560
folder.

46:54.560 --> 47:01.560
And see, now what I'm worried about is this OneDrive stuff is sort of wedging out the

47:01.560 --> 47:04.480
own cloud usage because now I've got...

47:04.480 --> 47:05.480
Yeah.

47:05.480 --> 47:10.960
So, to summarize, you went to Microsoft and expected to be able to integrate Microsoft

47:10.960 --> 47:12.440
solution with another open source solution.

47:12.440 --> 47:13.440
I know.

47:13.440 --> 47:15.240
That was the recommendation of the mom room last time we talked about.

47:15.240 --> 47:16.240
You know what I really wanted?

47:16.240 --> 47:17.240
It's a good recommendation.

47:17.240 --> 47:18.240
It's a good recommendation.

47:18.240 --> 47:19.240
It will solve the problem.

47:19.240 --> 47:20.240
I think.

47:20.240 --> 47:24.000
What I want is I want to go to docs.microsoft.com and I want a Word editor in my web browser.

47:24.000 --> 47:25.000
I actually want Spreadsheet.

47:25.000 --> 47:26.000
I guess I want spreads.microsoft.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Because she just needs to be able to pump up a spreadsheet.

47:28.000 --> 47:29.000
Right.

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
Right.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
Okay.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.560
But I just wanted to walk you through my logic train on this, like why I was going down

47:33.560 --> 47:35.040
the Office 365 route.

47:35.040 --> 47:36.040
Right.

47:36.040 --> 47:39.240
So, just to complete the picture because I did try something else and I'm going to tell

47:39.240 --> 47:40.240
you about that.

47:40.240 --> 47:42.240
And this is I think going to be my recommendation.

47:42.240 --> 47:47.240
But just to complete the Office 365 picture, what I opted to do is I went into Chrome and

47:47.240 --> 47:52.040
I made the Office 365 site a standalone app for Excel.

47:52.040 --> 47:57.880
And so, I was able to put an Excel icon down in her GNOME doc and she has a little Excel

47:57.880 --> 48:02.520
icon that when she clicks, it opens up a dedicated Chrome window and launches what looks a lot

48:02.520 --> 48:03.520
like Excel.

48:03.520 --> 48:04.520
That's awesome.

48:04.520 --> 48:09.320
So, yeah, it's not a one-to-one, but she launched it and she dug it and she thought it was okay.

48:09.320 --> 48:13.360
And what's great about that is you say it's not a one-to-one, but the reality is Microsoft

48:13.360 --> 48:18.480
changes Microsoft Office so freaking gosh darn much that really what is one-to-one now would

48:18.480 --> 48:20.240
not be one-to-one in nine months anyway.

48:20.240 --> 48:25.480
Well, and for her, I think in a way this works because she still has a Mac, although she

48:25.480 --> 48:26.480
hasn't been using it very much.

48:26.480 --> 48:29.440
But if she did move back or wanted to use it for something, the files would be there

48:29.440 --> 48:33.240
I guess and I don't have to worry about getting Office for her stupid Mac now, so that's good

48:33.240 --> 48:34.240
I guess.

48:34.240 --> 48:35.240
Yeah.

48:35.240 --> 48:38.120
I'm not like thrilled about it, but…

48:38.120 --> 48:42.640
So if we talk about the lesser of two evils, 365 is very much the lesser of two evils between

48:42.640 --> 48:45.400
that and the actual Office Suite for a number of reasons.

48:45.400 --> 48:47.640
One is like you said, it works on Linux.

48:47.640 --> 48:52.620
And two, you're going to upgrade your regular Office Suite for the $300 or $400 or whatever

48:52.620 --> 48:58.960
it is anyway and then you get four years of use essentially before you have to upgrade.

48:58.960 --> 49:03.040
The reality is most businesses are upgrading every one if not two years at most and so

49:03.040 --> 49:07.560
now you're getting that if it's really, would you say $60 a year?

49:07.560 --> 49:09.940
That's actually a pretty competitive offering.

49:09.940 --> 49:13.640
It's not bad if you figure it's kind of a business standard and it's nice to be able

49:13.640 --> 49:15.560
to say you can do this under Linux now.

49:15.560 --> 49:17.280
So I totally dig that.

49:17.280 --> 49:20.000
There is another route that I'm going to have her try for a little bit and see what she

49:20.000 --> 49:23.600
thinks and only she can really tell me about the true compatibility because I've tried

49:23.600 --> 49:27.300
to open up her spreadsheets and I'm a total spreadsheet idiot and they look like they

49:27.300 --> 49:28.480
work fine to me.

49:28.480 --> 49:34.620
But it's Kingsoft Office and they have like a very competitive, I know you're pretty familiar

49:34.620 --> 49:35.620
with this, right?

49:35.620 --> 49:40.200
They have a competitive looking spreadsheet program that in some ways has sort of a ribbon

49:40.200 --> 49:41.200
UI.

49:41.200 --> 49:45.400
It's supposed to have fantastic compatibility with Excel spreadsheets.

49:45.400 --> 49:49.320
It comes out of China so some people are a little uncomfortable with that I guess.

49:49.320 --> 49:54.480
And it has like full importing of the more recent 2010 style files.

49:54.480 --> 49:58.000
You can switch and toggle between different UI styles which is kind of neat and it has

49:58.000 --> 50:00.120
the benefit of being a local app and it's free.

50:00.120 --> 50:02.880
It's not open source but it's cost free.

50:02.880 --> 50:10.060
So it's in the Arch Repos like WPS Office I think, yeah WPS-Office is the Arch Repo

50:10.060 --> 50:11.060
package.

50:11.060 --> 50:17.720
So it's called WPS Office now and it, I don't know if you have the video version up Noah

50:17.720 --> 50:23.880
but it looks like a, it's definitely got a nicer UI even than say Open Office does.

50:23.880 --> 50:26.640
We talked about it at last a couple of weeks ago and I looked into it then.

50:26.640 --> 50:29.000
Now did you look into Collegra?

50:29.000 --> 50:30.840
I haven't looked into Collegra, no.

50:30.840 --> 50:31.840
No I haven't done that.

50:31.840 --> 50:32.840
Okay that's the other one that I'm talking about.

50:32.840 --> 50:36.600
I haven't personally used it but I've been told now by three different people that were

50:36.600 --> 50:40.560
previously Microsoft Office users that said LibreOffice wasn't cutting it for them but

50:40.560 --> 50:41.560
Collegra did it.

50:41.560 --> 50:42.560
I actually looked at that too.

50:42.560 --> 50:45.880
Kingslow, this is looking really solid.

50:45.880 --> 50:53.280
And the downside again, Collegra is to the best of my knowledge, it's not open source.

50:53.280 --> 50:54.960
Oh it's not?

50:54.960 --> 50:58.200
Well see here's the thing, I remember it came from KOffice so I always thought it was but

50:58.200 --> 50:59.200
somebody told me.

50:59.200 --> 51:00.240
No, I'm pretty sure it did.

51:00.240 --> 51:03.320
It was the old KOffice and that's one of the reasons I haven't done this because she doesn't

51:03.320 --> 51:05.960
have very much QT stuff on her system.

51:05.960 --> 51:12.560
But I would install all the QT for the KDU4 based libraries but Collegra itself should

51:12.560 --> 51:14.280
work always fine for me.

51:14.280 --> 51:15.280
So yeah.

51:15.280 --> 51:16.280
I give it a go.

51:16.280 --> 51:20.060
So they, yeah it looks like the chat room agrees, they say oh wait no, Ram says it has

51:20.060 --> 51:21.680
worse compatibility compared to LibreOffice.

51:21.680 --> 51:26.040
Well I don't mind installing it on my machine and giving it a go for her but right now I

51:26.040 --> 51:28.840
know she can get it done with Office 365.

51:28.840 --> 51:31.040
Like I know that works so I feel pretty good about that.

51:31.040 --> 51:36.720
The only thing I'm a little worried about is it sort of negates her need for own cloud

51:36.720 --> 51:40.560
a little bit or I'm going to say hey Ange, I now need you to use OneDrive, own cloud

51:40.560 --> 51:41.560
and Dropbox.

51:41.560 --> 51:45.820
It's a bit of a mess so I need to kind of work that out but I feel like this is some

51:45.820 --> 51:49.720
good insights I'm getting to help other potential Linux switchers out there in the audience

51:49.720 --> 51:50.720
in the future.

51:50.720 --> 51:53.240
So they're good little bumps to hit.

51:53.240 --> 51:57.000
They're not unsolvable but they're stuff that if maybe you didn't have somebody helping

51:57.000 --> 52:00.120
you would be a big sticky point and so if we can learn these things then maybe we can

52:00.120 --> 52:01.240
help people make that transition.

52:01.240 --> 52:06.000
So WPS Office is one and if you don't mind giving Microsoft some of your hard-earned

52:06.000 --> 52:11.840
dollars or whatever your currency is, Office 365, at least make it a business write-off

52:11.840 --> 52:15.400
for God's sakes people, that's what I did, geez.

52:15.400 --> 52:22.640
And I got to say if you're a little Google paranoid you could totally, literally you

52:22.640 --> 52:26.920
get Outlook, you get Active Directory, you get everything.

52:26.920 --> 52:31.840
You get all the Microsoft stuff for five bucks a month and then you go like nine bucks a

52:31.840 --> 52:35.640
month and you get some other crap too like you get the actual like desktop apps and crap

52:35.640 --> 52:36.640
like that.

52:36.640 --> 52:40.800
So the five dollar a month is just the web apps from Microsoft which if you're a Linux

52:40.800 --> 52:43.360
user that's fine, that's all you need.

52:43.360 --> 52:47.440
If you've got some Windows in your life, I'm not going to judge you that much but you can

52:47.440 --> 52:48.440
pay nine bucks.

52:48.440 --> 52:51.520
That's funny, that's funny, you'd think the people running Windows would get a cheaper

52:51.520 --> 52:52.520
deal.

52:52.520 --> 52:59.880
So anyways, wps-community.org for the Kingsoft version of the WPS Office, that's wps-community.org

52:59.880 --> 53:03.280
and you can Google search for Office 365 and good luck to you because they've got like

53:03.280 --> 53:05.920
a hundred different websites you can land on to order that crap.

53:05.920 --> 53:09.200
It's like all other Microsoft products, it's super confusing.

53:09.200 --> 53:15.000
But yeah, other than that, other than that one small complaint, I think she's actually

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
going to be okay.

53:16.000 --> 53:19.440
I think we're finally sort of in the green, Noah.

53:19.440 --> 53:23.280
The one thing we have to work out is the drive space issue, that's getting a little tight.

53:23.280 --> 53:26.180
And really, actually if you think about it, really that's more of a monetary issue than

53:26.180 --> 53:33.200
everything else because we can, I'm just looking here, we can order an M.2 drive and she had

53:33.200 --> 53:35.200
a one terabyte before?

53:35.200 --> 53:36.280
Yeah.

53:36.280 --> 53:40.280
So I don't know if they make one quite that big, well they do, Samsung has the Evo, it

53:40.280 --> 53:42.720
is $465 so we can get a one terabyte.

53:42.720 --> 53:45.320
I wonder if they, I wonder what she would need.

53:45.320 --> 53:48.640
She and I have been talking about changing her photos to drop that down and maybe we

53:48.640 --> 53:51.720
can get by with a 512, but I'll talk to her tonight about that, see what she wants to

53:51.720 --> 53:52.720
do.

53:52.720 --> 53:54.720
Yeah, if we do a five, that cuts the price in almost half, it's $265.

53:54.720 --> 53:57.760
Maybe we pick that up and fries when you're down here this weekend.

53:57.760 --> 53:58.760
Yeah, yep.

53:58.760 --> 54:04.680
Noah's going to be in town for the Linux Action Show on Sunday and I got a few things I'm

54:04.680 --> 54:08.200
doing to get ready around here for you because I know you have some shenanigans in the works.

54:08.200 --> 54:10.440
What kind of shenanigans are you up to while you're out here this weekend?

54:10.440 --> 54:16.360
I have, well here's the thing, I had more shenanigans when I originally started planning

54:16.360 --> 54:18.680
this trip because the original thing I was going to do was, well I was going to build

54:18.680 --> 54:24.320
a box to fix your HDMI capture and then fix the nook, but actually sounds like for the

54:24.320 --> 54:27.000
most part you got the nook thing straightened out thanks to system 76.

54:27.000 --> 54:30.500
Yeah, at least for now I'm using their Miracat, although I do have to send it back at some

54:30.500 --> 54:31.500
point.

54:31.500 --> 54:36.880
Right, well so maybe we'll still tackle that and then I need to fix that other HDMI capture

54:36.880 --> 54:41.280
because even if we have it replaced, we can either use it as a backer or we can put it

54:41.280 --> 54:42.520
in the mobile production rack.

54:42.520 --> 54:47.120
You know what would be an awesome, totally crazy, not going to happen stretch goal?

54:47.120 --> 54:48.120
What's that?

54:48.120 --> 54:52.600
Is if we could dig up some extra hardware around here and put OBS on it and give me

54:52.600 --> 54:55.560
that secondary streaming machine so I don't have to reboot the stream anymore between

54:55.560 --> 54:56.560
shows.

54:56.560 --> 54:57.560
Okay, it's going to happen.

54:57.560 --> 55:00.640
Because then we would have our live stream powered by Linux.

55:00.640 --> 55:02.000
I just decided it's going to happen.

55:02.000 --> 55:05.160
Well, it's a stretch goal, but I think we might be able to make it this weekend.

55:05.160 --> 55:07.760
I don't know if we have the hardware for it, but maybe we can move things around.

55:07.760 --> 55:08.760
It's going to happen.

55:08.760 --> 55:09.760
We'll see, we'll see.

55:09.760 --> 55:10.760
So yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

55:10.760 --> 55:11.760
So Noah will be in studio.

55:11.760 --> 55:13.440
You know what's funny though?

55:13.440 --> 55:18.160
Rotten went to all that trouble to make that really great art, the frames, which we're

55:18.160 --> 55:21.600
tweaking like my look and Noah's look still, but the frames themselves look amazing on

55:21.600 --> 55:22.940
this week's episode of Linux Actual.

55:22.940 --> 55:26.520
Thank you Rottencorpz again for making some great frames for us so we have a nice consistent

55:26.520 --> 55:28.020
look for the show now.

55:28.020 --> 55:31.520
And of course, we finally get it rolled out and now Noah's going to be in studio.

55:31.520 --> 55:34.600
So I don't know how that's going to work.

55:34.600 --> 55:37.720
So I mean, yeah, we can have a tweak those frames, but the reality is I might be there

55:37.720 --> 55:41.200
this week, but the remaining 50 some weeks in the year, yeah, yeah, right.

55:41.200 --> 55:42.200
I don't know.

55:42.200 --> 55:43.200
No, it's good.

55:43.200 --> 55:45.720
It's just ironic that we finally got that all in and then the next following episode,

55:45.720 --> 55:50.120
we're going to probably undo it because it doesn't really fit for, yeah.

55:50.120 --> 55:51.120
But I don't know.

55:51.120 --> 55:53.680
In that case, I'll just make one.

55:53.680 --> 55:56.280
I'll make an extra overlay for it when he's in.

55:56.280 --> 55:57.280
Like a one shot camera?

55:57.280 --> 55:59.400
Because yeah, we're both on one camera in that one.

55:59.400 --> 56:00.400
Yeah.

56:00.400 --> 56:01.400
Yeah.

56:01.400 --> 56:02.400
It's kind of, but it's going to be fun.

56:02.400 --> 56:06.840
And it's going to be a packed episode because we'll be doing the Fedora 22 review and we're

56:06.840 --> 56:11.040
going to interview the folks from the Autotest site, right, Rottencorpz?

56:11.040 --> 56:12.040
Is that Autotest?

56:12.040 --> 56:13.040
Is that what it is?

56:13.040 --> 56:14.040
I'm blanking on his name.

56:14.040 --> 56:15.040
Yeah.

56:15.040 --> 56:16.040
Autotest.

56:16.040 --> 56:17.040
Yeah.

56:17.040 --> 56:18.040
And these are the folks.

56:18.040 --> 56:19.040
Lucas.

56:19.040 --> 56:20.040
Lucas.

56:20.040 --> 56:21.040
Thank you.

56:21.040 --> 56:22.040
Lucas from Autotest.

56:22.040 --> 56:23.640
Autotest is the project behind the automated testing of the Linux kernel, Ubuntu, Red Hat.

56:23.640 --> 56:27.680
Like whenever, like you hear a big project saying, we automatically test our builds for

56:27.680 --> 56:30.440
automated QA every single day to ensure quality.

56:30.440 --> 56:32.720
When you hear them say that, they're probably using Autotest.

56:32.720 --> 56:36.480
So we want to talk to Lucas and say, hey, you know, you are the folks behind all of

56:36.480 --> 56:39.880
these projects that we depend on and making sure that they are doing build really good

56:39.880 --> 56:40.880
solid builds.

56:40.880 --> 56:43.520
And hey, by the way, this is really important for rolling software too.

56:43.520 --> 56:45.820
Obviously that's my angle a little bit.

56:45.820 --> 56:48.580
So we want to talk to Lucas this Sunday, which is great, right?

56:48.580 --> 56:53.200
Because so on Sunday, we're going to talk to Lucas about auto testing for build quality.

56:53.200 --> 56:56.280
And today on Unplugged, we talked to Michael about benchmarking.

56:56.280 --> 56:58.680
Two sort of similar veins and I thought it's great.

56:58.680 --> 57:01.400
If you are, if you listen to both shows, I think they're going to fit together together

57:01.400 --> 57:02.400
really well.

57:02.400 --> 57:03.400
But here's the catch.

57:03.400 --> 57:08.920
That interview with Lucas is probably going to air in a couple of weeks or a week or so.

57:08.920 --> 57:11.360
We'll probably air the Fedora 22 review this Sunday.

57:11.360 --> 57:14.080
So if you show up live, you're going to get extra show because we're only going to air

57:14.080 --> 57:16.520
one of the two segments first.

57:16.520 --> 57:20.000
And but we'll record them both this Sunday since Noah's going to be in studio with the

57:20.000 --> 57:22.640
Fedora 22 review and that interview.

57:22.640 --> 57:26.840
Join us on Sunday, jblive.tv, 10 a.m. Pacific, then the photo show after that.

57:26.840 --> 57:30.360
Go to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar to get that in your local time zone.

57:30.360 --> 57:36.040
I also just wanted to give a mention, Ange was intending to join us for the ThinkPad

57:36.040 --> 57:42.000
transition of the Linux switch update because she has a lot more to share.

57:42.000 --> 57:46.080
But her mom is in the hospital today and she needed to be with her.

57:46.080 --> 57:50.840
So my thoughts are with Ange and her mom and she will hopefully join us maybe next Tuesday

57:50.840 --> 57:53.680
because it's it's fun to see her enjoy it.

57:53.680 --> 57:57.920
You know, I come down, I mean, every now and then like she runs into issues and I'm like,

57:57.920 --> 57:58.920
oh, I'm sorry.

57:58.920 --> 57:59.920
I'll fix that.

57:59.920 --> 58:04.800
But more often than not, she's smiling, which is pretty, pretty fun because if you guys

58:04.800 --> 58:08.120
listen for a while, you know, this is not always worked out so well.

58:08.120 --> 58:10.880
So it's kind of a nice change of pace to have her say, oh, this is so cool.

58:10.880 --> 58:12.800
I love how it does X.

58:12.800 --> 58:15.720
So maybe we'll get her to share some of that when she joins us next Tuesday.

58:15.720 --> 58:19.040
In the meantime, though, I want to tell you about something you should try out and then

58:19.040 --> 58:22.680
we'll get to Fedora 22 and that is Linux Academy.

58:22.680 --> 58:25.680
Go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged right now.

58:25.680 --> 58:28.320
Once you go there right now to get our special discount, you go to linuxacademy.com slash

58:28.320 --> 58:30.980
unplugged and you get a 33 percent discount.

58:30.980 --> 58:34.160
Linux Academy is a great service set up by people that had a vision before I did.

58:34.160 --> 58:35.200
I wish I would have thought of this.

58:35.200 --> 58:36.560
This is totally brilliant.

58:36.560 --> 58:40.320
It's created by people truly enthusiast, truly enthusiastic and passionate about Linux and

58:40.320 --> 58:45.120
open source and all of the technology in the ecosystem around that.

58:45.120 --> 58:47.020
Why do I tell you that?

58:47.020 --> 58:48.020
Why does that matter?

58:48.020 --> 58:51.840
Why am I telling you that when this is a training website designed for people who love Linux?

58:51.840 --> 58:54.120
Because there's a lot of training resources online.

58:54.120 --> 58:55.800
There's crappy YouTube videos.

58:55.800 --> 59:00.520
There's generalist sites that get paid billions because they teach you everything from fixing

59:00.520 --> 59:04.760
your refrigerator to changing the tire on your car to Adobe After Effects and there

59:04.760 --> 59:09.680
is a place in the market for that, obviously, but that's not what you need.

59:09.680 --> 59:14.080
You need stuff created by people that truly care about Linux and open source.

59:14.080 --> 59:16.720
You guys know that makes a difference and that's why I tell you where Linux Academy

59:16.720 --> 59:17.760
comes from.

59:17.760 --> 59:21.400
Before we brought them on as a sponsor, I sat down on the phone with them and talked

59:21.400 --> 59:25.200
for a long time about where they came from, what their passions were, where they're going,

59:25.200 --> 59:29.120
why they're doing this and in fact, we actually hit the pause button a little bit early on

59:29.120 --> 59:32.760
in our relationship and we said, why don't we hit pause because you guys are about to

59:32.760 --> 59:35.720
do something really cool and I'll tell you what that is in just a second.

59:35.720 --> 59:38.520
Once you do that, I think you're going to be perfect for my audience and we waited a

59:38.520 --> 59:42.080
couple of months and they rolled that out and they were really on the ball with this

59:42.080 --> 59:43.080
whole thing.

59:43.080 --> 59:47.000
They told us what their vision was and man, they didn't only execute on that.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.480
They overshot and they achieved even more so I was super impressed.

59:49.480 --> 59:53.000
We brought them in as a sponsor right away and they've been with us every single week

59:53.000 --> 59:54.680
since then because they're perfect.

59:54.680 --> 59:57.680
Here's the feature they were working on that I knew you guys were going to love is they

59:57.680 --> 01:00:01.520
were working on integrating their lab system to spin up automatically in the courseware.

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:04.880
You just get to that spot in the courseware and the virtual machines just start up in

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:09.480
the back end, give you an SSH login and you're working on a real Linux box.

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:13.600
But the part that was really genius is they said, we're going to have it so you can choose

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:17.640
any Linux distro in your courseware so the system is smart enough where if you chose

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:22.040
CentOS or you chose Debian for your courseware, when it gets to that part in the courseware,

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:27.600
then they'll just spin up a Debian VM or a CentOS VM and then almost every week that

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:29.160
we have a spot, there's something new to talk about.

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:33.800
I love these nuggets, these single how-tos and just get in there and do something real

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:34.800
quick.

01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:35.800
In fact, check this out.

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:36.800
They just updated it.

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:40.880
If you go to linuxacademy.com, start by going to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged but then

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:42.840
check out their nuggets section.

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:45.200
We've been adding this all the time because it's quick contents, you don't have to have

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:49.120
a whole course on it, just something you need to know to make you better at doing your job,

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:52.760
make you faster at doing your job, make you a little more confident at doing your job

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:55.720
or maybe help you learn something so you can get a new job.

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:59.640
So if you go to linuxacademy.com slash nuggets, here's a new one they just posted, virtual

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:03.240
box, clone a VM and change the UUID using the command line.

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:07.880
Here's another virtual box, running a headless VM mode, building a firewall with IP tables,

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:08.880
another quick nugget.

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:09.880
How great is that?

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:12.880
You can do quick video courses and when you log in, you just take it and watch it and

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:14.040
you're done.

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:17.480
Creating a pixie boot server, setting up linux single sign-ons, all this stuff.

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:20.480
Look at all these freaking nuggets they have over here.

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:22.880
You could just spend all your time right there if you wanted to and just learn individual

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:27.160
things and get better at each thing, setting up SSH keys, editing an ISO image, working

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:31.320
with DOS box, securing SSH, I love that one, configuring Linux kernel parameters, writing

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:35.780
custom Java services, how Nmap can be used to compromise your system, how NetStack can

01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:39.560
be used to compromise your system, MD5 checksums and how to use them.

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:42.800
All individual topics that we could all probably stand a little bit more on.

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.800
Linuxacademy.com slash nuggets to see those.

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:49.120
Start by going to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, you get our 33% discount, they have new stuff

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:52.960
they're rolling out all the time, like the new DevOps courseware, the Red Hat certified

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:57.560
stuff, the AWS stuff is always being updated, first on the scene with Docker and the best

01:01:57.560 --> 01:01:59.360
material on Docker, all of it.

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:00.360
Linuxacademy, more than that.

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:03.240
I literally could spend the whole show telling you it all.

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:05.560
They have an unbelievable amount of content and that's why the subscription service makes

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:06.560
so much sense.

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:10.000
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and a big thank you to Linux Academy for freaking rocking

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.600
our face with the awesome support and creating a service that's truly great for Linux users.

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:15.200
I really love being able to say that.

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:19.200
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:26.320
Alright so Fedora 22 is installed on a, System76 was very nice to send me a test bonobo, it's

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:30.480
like a couple of generations old, but that's fine, it's like a core i7 with, I think it

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:36.760
has 120 gigabyte SSD in it, I think it has 8 gigabytes of RAM in it, an NVIDIA 7 series

01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:42.560
GPU dedicated, 17 inch screen, really nice laptop, I love the bonobo series.

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:46.440
So this is such a good machine to test this stuff on, absolutely love it.

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:50.960
So today Fedora 22, or was it yesterday, no it's today, Fedora 22 was released and we'll

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:56.040
be talking mostly about the workstation spin, of course the big feature in Fedora 22 is

01:02:56.040 --> 01:03:01.160
GNOME 3.16 which means you're gonna get them new notifications, that little bar down at

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:05.360
the bottom is gone now and your icons are off in this little tray area off to the side,

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:09.960
I happen to like it, I know some people freaking hate it, and they've done a few tweaks to

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:13.720
the default GNOME setup that you don't get on your standard GNOME desktop.

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:16.880
The one that you don't care about is that little Fedora logo that's in the bottom of

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:22.920
the corner is actually an extension, so whatever background you change I believe it stays overlaid.

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:24.740
I thought that was kind of interesting.

01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:29.140
They've done a few other tweaks too like when your terminal completes a command, it'll generate

01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:32.960
a notification using the new GNOME notification system, that's a Fedora specific tweak, that

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:36.360
is not in general GNOME, I thought that was kind of an interesting little, like where

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:38.840
they chose to make their tweaks was kind of funny.

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:43.240
Of course GNOME 3.16's backend has better OpenGL support, you have the improved Edwardia

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:47.160
themes, GNOME's image viewer has been redesigned, files now comes with bigger icons, thumbnails

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:53.440
by default, re-run as menus, this is cool, I really love to see Fedora doing this, installation

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:58.400
of GStreamer codecs, fonts, and certain document types now handled by software.

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:05.480
And this is where I realized Fedora's, for me as an end user, Fedora's edge comes up

01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:07.440
over distributions like Arch.

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:12.240
All this stuff I just said, except for the terminal completion thing, it's been in Arch

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:15.000
for weeks.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:21.540
But what Arch can't do is sort of have a unilateral decision on how we're going to deliver something

01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:24.560
and everything pivots and does that now.

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:28.680
And what Fedora does, like when they rolled out GNOME software, well that's just how you

01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:30.720
get stuff now.

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:37.360
You know, like codecs, you need something installed, updates, everything is just done

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:38.840
through GNOME software.

01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:44.780
So with Fedora, not only do you get the latest and greatest software like GNOME 3.16 and

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:50.300
all these great improvements, but it's presented in a way where it feels like a more cohesive

01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:54.880
package than it does when you put it together yourself.

01:04:54.880 --> 01:05:00.040
And so my initial impressions with Fedora are really positive.

01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:04.360
I'm starting to finally become a little more comfortable with the installer.

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:08.000
I have a little bit of complaints still about how you'd partition with the installer, but

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.560
the installer's looking pretty good.

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:14.200
All of it's pretty nice, pretty fast, graphical boot's pretty good.

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:15.880
I did have a major technical snafu.

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:17.480
I'm going to tell you guys about that.

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:21.360
Before I get into that part, does anybody have any Fedora 22 experiences in the Mumble

01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:25.120
Room they want to share with us?

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:28.800
So I've been playing with Fedora a little bit.

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:35.120
I haven't downloaded the official ISO yet, I was just playing with the beta one.

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:37.920
But have you had a chance to play with DNF at all?

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:41.440
Yeah, I've only installed a few things with DNF, but there's a couple of interesting things

01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:42.440
about it.

01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:43.440
Yeah, thanks for bringing that up.

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:46.480
Yeah, DNF seems to be faster.

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:49.640
There's a couple other things that I thought was interesting about DNF.

01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:54.220
Updates that don't work, like a bad update or something, it's just totally skipped.

01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:57.880
Before in YUM, you had to do dash dash skip dash broken, but now DNF just does that by

01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:58.880
default.

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:02.880
Repositories, the 404, DNF doesn't lose its crap, it just skips right over them, doesn't

01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:06.720
care, which is nice because some of the RPM Fusion stuff isn't up to date.

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:11.080
There's a few repos for Fedora 22 that aren't up to date, I think Fusion is now.

01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:15.080
When you remove a package with DNF, it will automatically remove any dependent packages

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:17.840
that were not explicitly installed by the user.

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:20.860
This one, I wonder if it's biting me in the ass, because I feel like I couldn't get my

01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:22.640
software installed at one point.

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:28.920
DNF will check for updates in the background every hour... Wait, no, I'm sorry.

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:33.960
By default, DNF will check for updates in configured repositories hourly, starting 10

01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:35.200
minutes after the system boots.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:40.520
After your first 10 minutes, and then every hour after that, it checks for updates.

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:49.480
I don't know if this is why, but I launched software, and I tried to install a re-edit,

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:52.560
a re-text, whatever, the markdown editor, and it just hung.

01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:53.560
It never installed.

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:55.600
I was wondering if maybe it was because DNF was trying to do an update in the background

01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:57.900
too to check for updates.

01:06:57.900 --> 01:07:05.440
What's really nice is the GNOME software, so when I search, so if I do gparted in search,

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:09.280
it's doing a really instant good job of pulling results out of GNOME software too.

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:14.320
If I don't have gparted installed, it'll show up, and it's just one click, and it's installed.

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:16.820
No password has to be entered, nothing.

01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:19.920
It's really nice.

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:24.760
That's largely why I like to stick with Fedora, at least on one of my machines, and why I

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:29.900
kind of consider it my main distro, is because I do so much work in the server sphere where

01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:31.560
we have so much Red Hat Enterprise.

01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:32.800
YUM is going to die.

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:37.560
DNF is going to be the eventual replacement for it.

01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:43.120
In Fedora 22, the YUM command is symlinked to DNF now, and then it gives you a warning

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:45.920
saying YUM is deprecated.

01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:48.040
The same thing happened with the service command, right?

01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:51.240
I don't know if this still works in Fedora, but it definitely works in Red Hat 7.

01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:57.320
If you type in service sshd stop, it redirects that to system control, which is great for

01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:58.400
people like me.

01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:04.240
So I'm going to use DNF now for a couple years before RHEL 8 comes out, and when RHEL 8 comes

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:08.800
out and everyone's going, oh, well, and this is assuming they've replaced YUM with DNF

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:12.960
in RHEL 8, if that happens and everyone else is saying, oh, this is something new, I'm

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:16.920
going to say, well, I actually have been playing with it for three years, so it's great.

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:21.320
And that is fundamentally why I continue to use Fedora.

01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:26.480
So a couple of big changes for graphical desktops have hit this version, and I think some people

01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:29.320
have hit some snags with those, and that's where one of my snags was.

01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:31.520
Oh, Minimac, I wanted to give you a chance to chime in.

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:32.520
Go ahead.

01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:35.000
Oh, yeah, actually, this is exactly the line where I was going next.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Lib input, yes.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Exactly.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Jump in on that, would you?

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.120
Yeah, I would like to.

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:50.040
So as I told you before, I'm running this on a Chromebook, Acer C720P, and the touchpad

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:56.700
was not the best one using the Synaptics driver, and it's working quite better with Lib input,

01:08:56.700 --> 01:09:00.360
but Lib input has less features than Synaptic has.

01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:06.560
So some people that are upgrading from Fedora 21 to Fedora 22 will have some problems using

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:11.000
their touchpad in the normal way they were using it before.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:17.320
Yeah, I noticed immediately under the Bonobo that the touchpad has worked like there's

01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:19.220
just something different about it.

01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:21.880
It feels like maybe they put butter underneath my mouse cursor.

01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:23.040
It just is a little smoother.

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:24.960
It feels like it's really locked onto my finger.

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:26.280
I like the speed.

01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:27.440
I've heard complaints, though.

01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:29.280
I've heard people complaining the speed doesn't work for them.

01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:30.280
It's a little glitchy.

01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:33.520
On the Bonobo, it's great.

01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:34.520
Lib input is great.

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:37.680
I don't know what it's going to be like now going back to other distros.

01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:40.300
I think I'm going to notice a difference.

01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:44.460
So I loved it, too, basically, but I have some special workflow.

01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:51.440
So I'm using a software for mouse gestures, and I was not able to do my normal mouse gesture

01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:52.440
with Lib input.

01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:57.520
So in the end, I just removed that package, and I wanted to blacklist the Lib input.

01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:59.160
I was not able to.

01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:05.120
So I removed Lib input, and now I'm working on synaptics again, and I have to configure

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:06.120
it with Xconfig.

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:07.120
Oh, boy.

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:10.800
God, now you feel like old Linux.

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:13.800
So that's the one big change for X users.

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:17.000
The other big change, yeah, you can use, okay, I will try that.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.760
So Blackout says you can use XF86 dash video dash Lib input on Arch to try it out.

01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:23.480
I might.

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:25.380
The other big change is GDM.

01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:30.360
If you have an open, if you're using an open source graphics driver, GDM, the Graphical

01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:37.480
Login Manager, not GNOME itself, but GDM uses Wayland by default.

01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:41.600
I know that's going to cause some people problems, because it caused me problems.

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:46.480
Essentially what would happen is I'd get grub, I'd hit enter, I would begin booting, I would

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:49.800
get the Graphical Fedora boot screen, which is quite nice, where it fills the Fedora logo

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:56.720
up as it boots, then it would hang with a completed boot logo for about 35 seconds,

01:10:56.720 --> 01:11:01.040
and then it drops down to a text console, and I get some sort of libc string errors.

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:02.040
I can't even tell what it is.

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:06.120
I get some string of errors, and the system never boots after that, or it never goes forward.

01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:10.120
It appears to hard lock even, because I can't control it, delete it, I can't ping it, anything

01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:12.760
like that.

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:17.760
My fix, unfortunately, and I have this in the show notes.

01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:22.120
If you guys run into this, if you, after your installation, even though your live session

01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:27.340
worked fine, if after you reboot, after first boot, it doesn't go into the graphical session,

01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:34.680
you can go into slash Etsy slash grub, or I'm sorry, slash, not grub, slash Etsy slash

01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:38.600
GDM, because you're changing GDM not to use Wayland, so go to slash Etsy slash GDM slash

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:47.280
custom.conf, edit custom.conf in Etsy GDM, and uncomment Wayland enable equal false.

01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:48.520
It's already in the file.

01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:52.920
You just uncomment the file and save it, and reboot the machine, and it won't try to use

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:53.920
Wayland for GDM.

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:57.700
Now, here's the tricky thing, because when it tries to launch Wayland, it hard locks

01:11:57.700 --> 01:11:58.980
the machine.

01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:03.540
Your options are to do no mode set at grub, you know, edit your grub boot line, and add

01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:10.480
no mode set, and then get in to your basic session, and then add that, remove that comment,

01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:16.200
or what I did, because I knew this was going to happen after my second installation, because

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:20.920
I wanted to change my partition layout anyways, is before I rebooted the installer from the

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:25.160
live environment, I just did a mount command, and I looked where my root file system was

01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:31.000
mounted at, and I just edited the custom.conf file right there from the live session, and

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:36.440
all you have to do is just remove that comment line, or just leave the Wayland enable equal

01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:42.120
false, leave that, just remove the hashtag, the print, whatever, the number sign, so it's

01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:45.520
not a comment anymore, and then when you reboot, your system will boot just fine.

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:48.240
You just have to disable Wayland, and that solved my problem, and now I'm able to use

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:53.360
the open source driver, I have full 3D acceleration under GNOME, I'm getting all the fancy OpenGL

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:56.840
effects, and my system boots, and it is running great.

01:12:56.840 --> 01:13:01.640
I've done updates since then, I've updated the base system, I've been installing applications,

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:03.400
I can't believe how fast it runs.

01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:04.920
I can't believe how fast this thing runs.

01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:06.600
It's so fast.

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:11.660
So my initial impression with Fedora 22 was a little rocky, because it never is a good

01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:15.360
impression after first boot to fail to get to X, that always kind of sucks, especially

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:19.560
when it's really reliable hardware, and you just had a live environment that was working,

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:23.880
so you know something's funky, but almost immediately to me it was probably like a Wayland thing.

01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:28.160
So there was a bug, now here's the only thing that might be tricky for you, is if you run

01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:33.520
into this, the way the Fedora project addresses this is they have a common problem section

01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:37.880
in their release notes, and they say it's a Macbook specific problem.

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:43.600
So they'll say Macbook graphics aren't working, and even in the Wiki they say certain Macbook

01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:48.100
laptops with dual graphics card, the Fedora 22 live environment boots fine, but after

01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:52.080
installation there's just a black screen with no boot splash, followed by the GNOME login

01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:53.080
screen.

01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:56.560
This seems to be an issue with Wayland, the upcoming windowing system used by the GNOME

01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:57.740
login screen.

01:13:57.740 --> 01:14:01.160
But it's actually not a Macbook issue, because I had it on the Bonobo.

01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:05.840
So I would bet it's probably a NuVu driver problem or specific model.

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:15.000
So Ray asks, does the GNOME software tool show GNOME apps?

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:19.480
And actually this is another problem with Fedora 22, and I have a link in the show notes

01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:21.360
about this.

01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:26.840
There is sort of a lack of apps in there right now, because there is an app description file

01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:30.540
that has to be updated in order to be displayed in GNOME software.

01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:34.960
That went mandatory starting with Fedora 22, and most of the projects that are in GNOME

01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:38.040
software have not submitted this app description file.

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:42.320
So there is a lot of apps missing right now from GNOME software.

01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:45.640
Developers will be re-adding those description files, or the package maintainers will be

01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:50.360
re-adding those description files over the next few days.

01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:53.760
So you might be a little surprised by a lack of items in GNOME software.

01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:57.880
Now a little bit of silver lining here.

01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:02.100
Red Hat has hired, or is actually moving another one of their developers to work full time

01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:05.280
on the Nuvoo project, or work more on the Nuvoo project.

01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:09.840
So while I just ran into this issue with Fedora 22, maybe it's going to be fixed by Fedora

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:11.980
23, and this has got to be good for Wayland.

01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:15.240
Red Hat's letting another one of their developers focus on improvements to the open source NVIDIA

01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:17.000
Linux graphics driver.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:22.980
Ben Skaggs is already a Nuvoo DRM driver maintainer, and David Arley, the overall DRM subsystem

01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:27.960
maintainer and contributor to Nuvoo, are already employees of Red Hat.

01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:29.400
So Hans will be joining.

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:33.240
He's been mostly known for his Linux USB contributions in the past.

01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:37.120
One year ago he joined the Red Hat graphics team, where he's worked on various Xorg and

01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:41.520
Wayland things, and he was also one of the developers that worked on libinput that we

01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:43.360
just talked about.

01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:46.840
So now with the libinput work settling down, his next course of action is going to be working

01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:47.840
on Nuvoo.

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:50.520
Right now it's not known specifically what he'll be focusing on, but he's still learning

01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:52.840
more about GPU driver programming.

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:56.120
But it's really good to see Red Hat doing this, and he's already shared his new focus

01:15:56.120 --> 01:16:00.400
with the Nuvoo community via their development mailing list.

01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:04.200
So Red Hat's putting some more weight behind this.

01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:07.800
So perhaps by Fedora 23 this was going to be a problem of the past.

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:11.000
It's just, yeah, like Blackout says, or Corky is saying, it's a transition.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Right Corky?

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.840
It's a transition to Wayland that's going to be bumpy for a little while, don't you

01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:14.840
think?

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:23.480
I do think that, and there's a lot of work to do, but it's very clear that the Fedora

01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:25.280
team are focused on this.

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:30.600
This is one of their main features as a Linux distribution.

01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:37.640
It only really matters inside the Linux community, but it's a big difference.

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:42.080
And I'm kind of, I'm looking forward to, I'm going to continue to run it for the rest of

01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:43.080
the week.

01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:44.680
I was running the beta versions.

01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:46.720
They also have the same Wayland problem.

01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:50.160
So I was hoping, in fact, I think I even sent Noah like a telegram the other night.

01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:52.960
I'm like, I'm hoping they fix this in the final ISO because this is the pain in the

01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:53.960
butt.

01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:58.080
But I'm not going to hold it against them because those things happen during these kinds

01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:01.360
of transitions and it's easy enough to fix and it is documented.

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:03.440
Not necessarily documented correctly, but it's documented.

01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:06.960
So now that this stuff's out of the way, I feel like I've got a great setup.

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:08.440
I've got a great performing system.

01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:09.440
It's on a great rig.

01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:11.840
It's going to be my main system for the rest of the week.

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:14.360
And then on Sunday, we'll give you the full take and see what I've been able to make of

01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:15.360
it.

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:17.240
Both Noah and I will be running it for the rest of the week.

01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:20.520
Noah, any thoughts so far before we close this topic up?

01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:21.520
Nope.

01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:22.520
Nope.

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:27.600
I don't have, I'm sure, you know, it's hard to give any real feedback the day the, like

01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:31.360
I haven't even installed the actual ISO yet, so I don't want to pass any, any of the problems

01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:32.360
I'm having.

01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:34.080
I don't want to talk about them until I actually get the ISO.

01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:37.880
And then really you don't know all the problems you're going to have until you've actually

01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:38.880
used it for like a week.

01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:40.600
Are you going to run it on a laptop?

01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:42.600
Is that what you'll be running on?

01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:43.600
Yep.

01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:47.120
So my thought process on that is I have a workstation at my house, my main machine at

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:50.560
my house, which does have Fedora, but I won't switch that over.

01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:52.880
I'm kind of in the same boat as Michael.

01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:56.120
I'll wait for a couple of days, maybe in a couple of weeks, until everything kind of

01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:57.120
fleshes out.

01:17:57.120 --> 01:18:00.080
And then once all that's smoothed over and I try everything on my laptop, then I'll move

01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:01.240
my actual workstation over.

01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:02.240
That makes sense.

01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:03.240
I like it.

01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:04.240
Yeah.

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:08.240
I could see my, I really can see myself one day maybe becoming a primary Fedora user.

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:09.240
Not yet.

01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:10.240
I don't think.

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:11.240
Maybe.

01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:12.240
I'll let you know on Sunday.

01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:14.480
Maybe I'll use this for a couple of days and fall in love.

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:16.580
There's a couple of tools out there I've already found that I really like.

01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:18.920
So it would just be a matter of getting some of my favorite applications I've had problems

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:19.920
with in the past.

01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:20.920
I'm looking at you, Rupat.

01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:21.920
Telegram.

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:22.920
I'm looking at you.

01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:23.920
So I'll let you guys know.

01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:25.240
I'd like to hear what you guys think.

01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:29.920
Go over to linuxactionshow.reddit.com and leave us your feedback for Fedora 22.

01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:34.360
And any tricks or tips that you would pass along to us to make it a better experience

01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:37.160
that maybe we could even pass along to the audience in Sunday's review.

01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:38.160
Love that too.

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:40.840
linuxactionshow.reddit.com is a great place to make this show even better.

01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:41.840
You can also email us.

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:46.060
Go to jupitabroadcasting.com slash contact and choose Linux Unplugged from the dropdown

01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:47.160
and send us in a note.

01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:48.160
We love that.

01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:49.160
That's really great.

01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:51.600
In fact, I'll try to get to a bunch of those next week because I don't think I've read

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:52.600
any notes for a couple of weeks.

01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:54.600
I guess I'm a bit of a jerk.

01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:55.600
Sorry about that.

01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:56.600
So we'll get to those soon.

01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:59.960
Also, we'd love to have you join us live and don't forget we're doing it at 10 a.m. Pacific

01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:01.200
next week.

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:04.100
Just next week we're doing a special early recording right after Tech Talk today.

01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:08.360
So show up if you'd like for Tech Talk today at 9 a.m. Pacific noon eastern.

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:10.640
And then just stick around for Linux Unplugged right after that.

01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:11.840
Should be fun to do.

01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:15.400
It'll be a morning edition of the Linux Unplugged show and then I'll be hitting the road to

01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:16.400
go pick up some family.

01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:17.400
All right, everybody.

01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:19.680
Well, thank you so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:49.120
We'll see you right back here next week.

01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:24.160
There we go.

01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:26.800
It looks like Mr. Laravel has left the room, I think.

01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:28.440
That was nice of him to stop by though.

01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:29.440
That was nice.

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:30.440
Good show, guys.

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:31.440
Thank you very much.

01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:35.040
Now we need titles, jbtitles.com.

01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:36.040
Now we vote to the death.

01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:40.720
Has anybody tried out the plasma spin of Fedora?

01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:41.720
Anybody?

01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:42.720
Anybody?

01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:46.320
Is that running Plasma 5?

01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:48.320
I believe it is.

01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:49.320
Nice.

01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:51.340
Where's Dreava?

01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:52.340
Mm.

01:20:52.340 --> 01:20:55.120
Poor man, Dreava.

01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:59.080
I've been running nothing but Plasma 5 on Arch lately.

01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:00.080
How do you like it?

01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:01.960
Oh, it's so good.

01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:07.900
I've been such a Gnome fan for like ever since I started, you know, being part of Linux and

01:21:07.900 --> 01:21:08.900
then Plasma 5 came out.

01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:09.900
Really?

01:21:09.900 --> 01:21:10.900
I'm like, oh.

01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:11.900
Same here.

01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:12.900
No.

01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:13.900
No, no.

01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:14.900
I started trying KD5.

01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:16.960
Plasma 5 two weeks or so ago or something.

01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:17.960
Yeah.

01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:18.960
And you like it?

01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:26.400
Yeah, but the Dolphin file manager doesn't have Qt5 support, I think, so the theme looks screwed up.

01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:33.040
So I'm back to Gnome again, so I'm gonna wait for the Qt5 things to work out correctly.

01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:38.240
I tell you, Plasma 5 is really great. I mean, it is really, really great.

01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:41.440
I still think there's too many options for me, but it really comes down to my sound problems.

01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:46.640
I switch for weekends. Like, I go on vacations to Plasma 5, and I'm like,

01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:50.480
oh, it's so geeky and cool, and they've thought of so many neat things.

01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:52.800
And then I get burned out, and I go back to Gnome.

01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:54.080
Yeah, same here.

01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:59.120
And I'm really in love with the window manager, KWin, and the Wobbluin.

01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:00.480
Yes, yes, yes.

01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:13.840
Chris, you mentioned once that Gnome has the great advantage now with 3.16,

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:18.480
that you almost do not realize that you're running a desktop environment,

01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:20.400
and that's the way to go for me.

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:24.720
I like that too. Just totally out of the way, and except for when I need it, it is there.

01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:29.600
Like, when I need to search for files, or when I need to check my calendar, or manage a setting,

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:34.000
it's there and gives me, I think, one of the best UIs to do that.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:39.120
But primarily, most of the time, I forget I'm even using a desktop environment, which I like.

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:44.560
You see, on my dual-screen desktop here, I'm running E17 with Gnome integration,

01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:49.520
so for me, the switch is E17, you don't realize that you're using it. It's just there.

01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:55.440
So, the title should probably have something to do with our chat with Michael or with Fedora 22,

01:22:55.440 --> 01:23:01.040
I would think. It's jbtitles.com. I like Fedora Explorer. I don't know, it's clever,

01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:06.960
but it doesn't really tell anybody what we talked about. You know? You know? You know?

01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:13.360
Wow, it says we talked about Fedora. Get it out of here!

01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:20.480
Uh, Fedora isn't yummy anymore, that's clever. Lock-in, slip and slide,

01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:23.760
I like that, but it doesn't really, again, cover what we talked about. Uh,

01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:38.960
uh, exploring Fedora, yeah, I guess. Chris, by the way, you're using Gnome 3.16, right?

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:46.880
Yes, sir. In the bottom left corner, if you're not using top icons, is the drawer, like,

01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:52.480
vibrating if you put your mouse in the wrong position? Yes, it does vibrate sometimes,

01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:58.160
let's see. Okay, then it's not only me, because that's on three of my computers.

01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:00.720
It kind of shakes, too, sometimes. Yeah, it shakes a little bit, yeah.

01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:07.280
So, it's like the top left corner, but it vibrates and acts weirdly.

01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:08.800
Yes, I wonder if they did that on purpose, or...

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:15.360
I don't think so, but if you turn on off animations, it stops doing that.

01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:19.200
Yeah, that makes sense. But I want my animations.

01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:24.480
Right. Uh, Chris, may I just ask, which age were you when you started using Linux?

01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:30.240
Well, I was still in high school, so I guess I was 18 or 19, 18, I guess, I suppose,

01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:35.040
is when I really first started, 17 or 18, I suppose. I'm 33 now.

01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:42.480
Yeah, I'm 19 now, so, and I've used Linux for the past two years.

01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:48.160
So, I'm somewhere in the 15 or 16-year range, but... Okay. Yeah.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.360
What was the first distribution?

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:55.840
Well, I guess, technically, the first distribution I probably used was Red Hat

01:24:55.840 --> 01:25:00.160
something, and then Debian around the same time. We had a Red Hat and Debian system,

01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:04.080
but they weren't my systems. Like, I used them, I destroyed them,

01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:08.720
I accidentally did rm-rf on the root while I was using the system, I did all of those things.

01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:09.440
That's clever.

01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:15.360
Yeah, but the first time I actually installed Mandrake or installed Linux for myself,

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:19.120
like, this is going to be my machine, I'm putting this on my computer now, it was Mandrake.

01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:27.760
So, for me, I started with SUSE 6.1, so I still have the box here, and a huge book that came with

01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:33.600
it. And then I started switching, I started switching from the different RPM distributions,

01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:39.840
landed with Mandrake, then came a short Debian phase, and then Ubuntu started, and then I stayed

01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:41.040
with Ubuntu for a long time.

01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:43.680
Yeah, me too.

01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:48.000
I suddenly feel like a noob here. My first distribution was 10.04.

01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:56.240
My first was 12.04, but, well, I'm only 19 now, and I was 17 when I started.

01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:00.000
Well, not for the first time, but for the first nerdy time.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:07.200
I was going to say Fedora 15 was my first one, and that one's pretty old compared to now.

01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:15.120
Yeah, that's funny. I remember when Fedora Core became a thing. I remember when they

01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:15.760
dropped the core.

01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:23.680
Yeah, in fact, what saved me from my Mandrake hate was Red Hat. It was Red Hat, I think it

01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:29.120
was 7, and then they transitioned from Red Hat to RHEL and Fedora Core, and then they

01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:34.160
dropped the core. It was funny because that's kind of what got me started on Fedora was I used

01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:38.480
Fedora because it was the logical progression from Red Hat, and then I've stuck with every

01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:43.520
core since Fedora Core 1 all the way up and just upgraded my system. In fact, the original

01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:50.240
Fedora Core box I still have. I never nuked and paved it. I just kept upgrading it, and I think

01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:56.160
it is on Fedora Core 4 or 5, and it still works. I turned it on in a while, but that's a testament

01:26:56.160 --> 01:26:57.920
to live. I've never actually had to do anything with it.

01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:03.120
Yeah. Hey, changing topics for a second, just thinking about the Mandrake story,

01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:06.880
the Mandrake company story, I think the Linux Action Show subreddit broke that story.

01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:12.160
I'm not positive because the guy that submitted it linked, well, obviously we didn't break it

01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:19.200
because that French website did, but I think we were the first US website to have it, and then

01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:25.200
LWN and Ferronix picked it up. Nobody linked to us, though.

01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:30.480
Well, we would. The subreddit post was 20 minutes before the Ferronix post.

01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:35.120
And you know, I've also been noticing, and it's fine, I guess. I mean, it's a subreddit,

01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:39.200
it's a public subreddit, so what can I say? It's fine. But I've also noticed several Softpedia

01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:44.400
stories based on stories out of the subreddit. It seems to be a resource for a lot of people,

01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:48.480
which I guess in a way is pretty awesome. I mean, one of the soapboxes we're on all the

01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:52.560
time is we need to improve the Linux press coverage, and if our subreddit's helping do that,

01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:56.720
it wasn't exactly what I had in mind, but I mean, shit, at least it's something.

01:27:56.720 --> 01:28:00.000
And the other thing is, too, is it would be nice if JB got some credit for it.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:00.640
Yeah, that would be...

01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:06.080
It's kind of common decency, even if it's not copyrighted.

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:08.880
Just give us a source link or something would be great.

01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:11.760
Right. Or even if all they said was,

01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:13.440
we pulled this from the JB subreddit and we pulled it,

01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:15.360
Jupiter Broadcasting reported today, something.

01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:16.880
That would be nice.

01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:19.600
I guess the way to capitalize... Yeah, see, the problem is they can always get it from

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:23.200
our subreddit. Even if we had our own news, even if we published that stuff on the site.

01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:28.000
But all right, so right now, Fedora Explorer is still our top title. I'm just not digging that.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.080
Fedora isn't yummy anymore coming in number two.

01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:31.440
Fed up Benchet?

01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:31.920
What's that?

01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:35.360
Fed up Benchet.

01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:37.840
Yeah, that's okay, too.

01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:38.560
Like, are you fed up?

01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:43.440
Fed up, yeah. Fed up Benchet, yeah. It's not bad. None of these are really awesome.

01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:47.200
How about Fedora Milady?

01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:50.560
What, dude? What's that got to do with anything?

01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:52.560
Madriva Falls and Fedora Rises.

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:53.920
Or Fedora Malinx.

01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:56.880
Madriva Falls and Fedora Rises?

01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:57.520
I got it.

01:28:57.520 --> 01:28:58.240
Fedora Hipster.

01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:01.280
Fedorable Benchmarks.

01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:03.760
Fedorable Benchmarks.

01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:05.520
But then it sounds like you're benchmarking Fedora, though.

01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:10.400
Madriva Falls, Fedora Rises, that's not bad.

01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:14.560
He does use Fedora, so technically that's sort of relevant.

01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:17.600
Would it be too much advertisement using the name Fornix in it?

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:19.840
I don't know.

01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:23.200
I think it would probably hurt the emphasis.

01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:26.000
Fedora gets benched, Fedora now and it's future.

01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:28.880
I guess we'll go with Fedora Rises, Madriva.

01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:29.920
What was it? What was it? What was it?

01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:30.880
Fedora Rises.

01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:34.240
As Madriva Falls, Fedora Rises.

01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:36.640
Fedora Rises, Madriva, and Madriva Falls.

01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:41.760
Whichever one sounds more catchy to me.

01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:42.560
It's kind of long.

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:45.200
Fedora Rises and Madriva Falls.

01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:48.480
Should it be Fedora Rises, Common, Madriva Falls?

01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:50.240
Yeah, it doesn't really fall.

01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:54.240
I mean, they were about to die and they got revived and they're still dead.

01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:55.680
So it's kind of bad for them.

01:29:55.680 --> 01:30:01.120
How about something like Madriva Passes Away and Fedora, Fedora's New Baby.

01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:03.520
I don't even think there's a place for Madriva in the title to be honest.

01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:04.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:05.920
I think you're probably right.

01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:08.080
I think that's probably right.

01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:08.880
Let's see.

01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:09.440
Fedora.

01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:11.600
I don't even know if I necessarily have to go with the title.

01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:14.560
I don't even know if I necessarily need Fedora in the title since Sunday's Linux Action Show

01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:15.360
is going to be about Fedora.

01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:22.640
I mean, you're fed up with seeing Linux regressions.

01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:24.640
You're fed up because Fedora.

01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:26.320
Because the program Fedora.

01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:27.280
And you're benchmarking it.

01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:29.120
Okay, you make it a good pitch.

01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:29.680
I'll give you that.

01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:34.320
You should probably use Fedora anyway just because it was released today anyway.

01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:34.800
Yeah, that's true.

01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:37.120
Madriva is the big news.

01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:37.620
You think?

01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:39.360
I'm not so sure it is.

01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:41.680
In fact, I think the sad thing is that it's not big news.

01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:45.360
Well, I think that it makes everybody start thinking back.

01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:46.640
It's nostalgic.

01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:52.160
Yeah, but to me, all it says is it's just verifying what I already thought years ago.

01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:53.280
So you've had a guest.

01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:55.120
Yeah, we did have a guest.

01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:56.240
We named it after the guest.

01:30:56.240 --> 01:30:57.360
Yeah, the votes.

01:30:57.360 --> 01:30:58.000
Yeah, that's true.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:58.880
I do agree with that.

01:30:58.880 --> 01:30:59.760
It would be a good way to go.

01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:02.560
Is Michael fed up with Bench?

01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:06.640
The regression killer, regression hater, hating regressions.

01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:10.640
The quest to kill, the quest to quell regressions.

01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:11.200
What about that?

01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:13.040
The quest to quell regressions.

01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:16.400
The quest to quell regressions.

01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:19.440
The quest to quell regressions.

01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:22.400
The quest to quell regressions.

01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:23.760
It seems more just Linux books.

01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:26.480
It sounds like the Linux benchmarking.com.

01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:26.720
Actually, not terrible.

01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:28.560
What about putting Linux performance on the record?

01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:29.280
Is that too long?

01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:31.600
How about just benchmarking Linux?

01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:34.400
Actually, you already have Linux on the...

01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:36.400
Linux Unplugged on the record.

01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:40.080
I think you already have Linux Unplugged based on benchmarks.

01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:41.920
It's on the record because it's the show.

01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:46.880
And it's still on the record because we're really recording the benchmarks and all about it.

01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:48.000
Benchmarking TNG.

01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:50.080
Come on, come on.

01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:51.040
There's got to be something in here.

01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:53.680
The quest to quell...

01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:55.200
Fedora chip to Madriva.

01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:56.400
I'm not sure what that is.

01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:59.120
The quest to quell... Fedora chip to Madriva.

01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:01.120
I actually kind of like the benchmarking Linux one.

01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:03.120
Doesn't that sound super boring though?

01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:04.880
Well, here's the thing.

01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:06.480
The problem with the quest to quell...

01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:09.520
That's really catchy, but it's like the least descriptive thing ever.

01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:10.000
Yeah, I know.

01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:13.120
What about Madriva benched?

01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:15.280
Well, it's not bad.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.680
How about Madriva sits the bench?

01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:21.360
Tip your Fedora to Madriva.

01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:28.240
Or Madriva bench no more.

01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:29.520
Microsoft buys Madriva.

01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:30.640
That one keeps jumping out at me.

01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:32.080
That would get some clicks.

01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:36.400
All right.

01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:37.120
All right.

01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:38.080
Benchmarking benchmark.

01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:39.200
You should just name it clickbait.

01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:41.040
That'd be good.

01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:43.280
Fedora next gets benched.

01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:44.640
Michael, the regression terminator.

01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:45.520
See, that's funny to me.

01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:46.080
That's funny.

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:48.000
Let's see.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:48.880
America's next top...

01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:52.960
But then everyone's going to be Michael, what, Michael from Coder Radio?

01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:53.440
What?

01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:53.920
Yeah, right.

01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:54.400
Yeah, that's true.

01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:58.480
How about you wouldn't believe what Michael does in his basement?

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:00.720
I like that, yeah.

01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:02.720
Michael's basement.

01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:05.200
Yeah, that's good.

01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:06.880
We should put something about that basement in there.

01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:09.840
I guess we could do...

01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:10.960
Basement benchmarking.

01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:12.640
I mean, yeah, we could do benchmarking Linux.

01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:15.840
That is like our basement benchmarking.

01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:20.400
Yeah, it kind of downplays what he's doing a little bit though.

01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:21.440
Linux gets benched.

01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:25.200
Benchmarking Linux only has two votes.

01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:28.800
Basement benchmark.

01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:30.080
Linux coming off the bench.

01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:33.680
Actually, no, I just typed it America.

01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:36.400
Step into larable's basement.

01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:41.360
Yeah, I don't know.

01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:44.080
I think we're going to have to go with benchmarking Linux as lame as that is.

01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:45.280
God, that seems lame.

01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:46.640
You know, that feels like a committee compromise.

01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:49.520
If we were doing benchmark Linux, I would want to do benchmarks as well

01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:53.920
instead of just reporting on one site doing benchmarks.

01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:58.400
I would do a lot more involvement in that title.

01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:01.600
So say again, so what now?

01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:06.080
If we were doing benchmarking as in the whole show's topic,

01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:12.080
I would want to also do my own benchmarks and report some fun findings back to the show.

01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:15.520
Yeah, yeah, it does seem like a title for a show where we're actually doing benchmarks, right?

01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:19.680
I used to do file system benchmarks all the time.

01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:24.640
That's why I landed on XFS back in like 2004 anyway.

01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:27.600
Is the question in the title something doable?

01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:30.480
Because if it is, you can ask, are you fed up?

01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:36.400
Regression terminator.

01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:38.480
Let's see, the quest.

01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:40.400
No, I got nothing with that.

01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:41.040
Let's see.

01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:43.840
There's got to be something in the fact that he benchmarks because he hates regressions.

01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:44.800
There's got to be a title there.

01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:48.560
Regressing on the bench.

01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:53.040
Which is terrible.

01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:56.720
Yeah, I think we're gonna have to go benchmarking Linux as awful as it is.

01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:02.560
Even though it kind of, oh yeah.

01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:05.360
And it is true because it is actually benchmarking the Linux kernel.

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:07.200
It literally is benchmarking Linux.

01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:11.120
Oh, oh, geez, get it out of here.

01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:24.240
Oh, we can use one sentence that Michael pulled off, which is Linux graphics drivers are in

01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:25.520
pair with Windows.

01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:27.360
So Linux pairs Windows.

01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:30.160
11 years.

01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:31.040
Okay.

01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:32.320
I do actually kind of agree.

01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:33.040
Actually, you know what?

01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:33.760
Micro 89.

01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:34.560
I do agree.

01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:36.160
Actually, Micro 89 is right.

01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:37.120
He's totally right.

01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:42.880
11 years of Linux benchmarking is sort of a call out to Ferronics and Michael, but also

01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:43.760
still about benchmarking.

01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:47.200
It doesn't make it sound like it's the episode itself is about benchmarking.

01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:50.320
But has he always been benchmarking?

01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:52.560
Close enough.

01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:54.000
Maybe it's just news science.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:55.040
Close enough.

01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:57.680
I'm going to go with 11 years of Linux benchmarking.

01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:00.160
I think it's actually pretty good.

01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:03.280
That's actually, if you think about it, it is once you realize it's Liar Bell, it's,

01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:04.800
I don't know, it's a good shout out to him.

01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:08.160
You could do just a decade, a decade of Linux benchmarks.

01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:09.280
Something like that.

01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:10.480
No, you can do something.

01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:11.680
Well, let's say even longer.

01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:12.880
Yeah, 11 is shorter.

01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:13.600
I know you're right.

01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:16.080
It reads better, but yeah.

01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:17.040
All right.

01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:17.600
Wow.

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:18.000
Wow.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:22.240
Just when I was about to flush it too, right at the last moment, you know what that means?

01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:23.520
We get a hello, everybody, from Obama.

01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:24.320
Hello, everybody.

01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:35.200
Hey, look at us.
