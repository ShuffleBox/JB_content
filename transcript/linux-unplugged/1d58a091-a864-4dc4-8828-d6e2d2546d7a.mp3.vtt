WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.720
Maybe before we start the show,

00:01.720 --> 00:04.360
let's talk about something that we can't really include

00:04.360 --> 00:07.360
in the show, because it's not only extremely visual,

00:07.360 --> 00:08.800
but it's one of those things you have to just kind of

00:08.800 --> 00:13.600
poke and explore yourself, radio.garden.

00:13.600 --> 00:17.840
And I could only describe this to you as

00:17.840 --> 00:22.840
a way the internet may have once looked in a retro future.

00:23.040 --> 00:25.680
You remember when, in like the late 90s,

00:25.680 --> 00:28.440
we would visualize the information superhighway

00:28.440 --> 00:30.840
as like this 3D plane that you would drive down,

00:30.840 --> 00:33.920
and websites and company sites would be like

00:33.920 --> 00:37.840
these 3D objects that you would approach and go inside of,

00:37.840 --> 00:40.120
and that's how we thought the web was gonna be, Wes.

00:40.120 --> 00:41.840
That's a Unix system.

00:41.840 --> 00:45.000
Yes, yes, that's a perfect example in Jurassic Park

00:45.000 --> 00:47.240
where they're flying through all the 3D objects.

00:47.240 --> 00:48.080
Well, now it's real.

00:48.080 --> 00:53.080
Radio.garden is a overlay on top of a Google globe

00:53.080 --> 00:58.080
of the Earth, and it's hotspots all over the Earth

00:59.040 --> 01:00.640
of radio stations.

01:00.640 --> 01:03.960
They've mapped online radio streams

01:03.960 --> 01:07.360
to their physical geolocation, and then represent that

01:07.360 --> 01:09.480
on a globe as points of lights.

01:09.480 --> 01:12.400
And so you can move about the globe,

01:12.400 --> 01:14.840
and it moves a cursor over the area,

01:14.840 --> 01:16.540
and then as soon as the globe stops,

01:16.540 --> 01:20.840
it begins playing the stream from that region of the Earth.

01:20.840 --> 01:25.000
And it's a super cool way to move the planet around

01:25.000 --> 01:28.040
and get a different feel for different music cultures

01:28.040 --> 01:28.960
all over the globe.

01:28.960 --> 01:30.160
It's so neat.

01:30.160 --> 01:33.200
Yeah, right, instead of just scanning your radio band,

01:33.200 --> 01:35.880
do it visually, and you might actually discover

01:35.880 --> 01:38.000
you oftentimes don't know where a random radio station

01:38.000 --> 01:39.720
that you can hear it's coming from.

01:39.720 --> 01:42.120
Yeah, I had not ever seen this.

01:42.120 --> 01:43.720
Popa, you've seen this thing before?

01:43.720 --> 01:45.360
No, because I get punched in the face

01:45.360 --> 01:47.680
with a this experience requires WebGL,

01:47.680 --> 01:50.880
please try again on a WebGL supported browser dialogue.

01:50.880 --> 01:51.720
What are you using?

01:51.720 --> 01:52.920
What are you using?

01:52.920 --> 01:54.920
The latest version of Firefox.

01:54.920 --> 01:57.720
Oh, I got a Firefox here in the studio.

01:57.720 --> 01:58.640
Interesting.

01:58.640 --> 02:01.000
I'm getting a retry for a live version

02:01.000 --> 02:03.480
cloud-free prompt and I try.

02:03.480 --> 02:04.680
Oh, we've DDoSed it.

02:04.680 --> 02:06.800
Well, all right, that'll be an exercise

02:06.800 --> 02:08.000
for after the show then.

02:10.360 --> 02:14.000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 275.

02:14.000 --> 02:19.000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

02:27.160 --> 02:29.360
that's just trying to stay warm.

02:29.360 --> 02:30.200
My name is Chris.

02:30.200 --> 02:31.200
My name is Wes.

02:31.200 --> 02:33.920
Hello, Wes, it's good to be connected with you.

02:33.920 --> 02:37.280
We have a great show, some super great community news,

02:37.280 --> 02:40.600
a bunch of it, we've kind of defined and distilled

02:40.600 --> 02:43.520
like the best news stories of the week from the community.

02:43.520 --> 02:44.720
We'll have those in there.

02:44.720 --> 02:47.040
And then Christian from Red Hat is joining the show.

02:47.040 --> 02:49.280
He'll discuss seamless Linux upgrades,

02:49.280 --> 02:53.160
replacing Paul's audio, some of the recent desktop projects

02:53.160 --> 02:55.880
that Red Hat's been working on, and the value

02:55.880 --> 02:57.640
that Red Hat gets from those desktop projects.

02:57.640 --> 02:58.920
Why are they doing it?

02:58.920 --> 03:02.120
And then a little Thunderbolt 3 doc follow up.

03:02.120 --> 03:03.760
Really looking forward to chatting about that

03:03.760 --> 03:05.560
with Mr. Wimpy because I'm looking for a new Thunderbolt

03:05.560 --> 03:07.000
doc from Milo Novo.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.920
And then we have the poll to name the automation system

03:09.920 --> 03:12.280
and then we'll wrap it up with a couple of app picks.

03:12.280 --> 03:13.560
It's a solid show, Wes.

03:13.560 --> 03:14.440
Oh, it's huge.

03:14.440 --> 03:16.600
There was a lot going on these past couple of weeks.

03:16.600 --> 03:18.760
So it took a lot of effort to distill this.

03:18.760 --> 03:20.320
I hope everyone appreciates.

03:20.320 --> 03:21.920
You know, to make sure we get it right,

03:21.920 --> 03:23.280
we're going to bring in our backup group.

03:23.280 --> 03:24.280
And that's our virtual log.

03:24.280 --> 03:25.720
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

03:25.720 --> 03:26.520
Peep, peep.

03:26.520 --> 03:27.020
Hello.

03:27.020 --> 03:27.520
Hello.

03:27.520 --> 03:29.120
Peek-a-boo.

03:29.120 --> 03:32.160
Hello, Brent and Cubicle Nate and Mac and Mini Mac

03:32.160 --> 03:36.040
and Popey and Sean, the Silent Drifter, and Mr. Wimpy.

03:36.040 --> 03:38.760
It is good to see you gentlemen in the show.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.440
I am remote again.

03:40.440 --> 03:42.660
So it's not really different for any of you,

03:42.660 --> 03:44.560
but it always feels different for me.

03:44.560 --> 03:46.720
But it's probably the same for most of you out there.

03:46.720 --> 03:48.560
But I had quite the experience that I just

03:48.560 --> 03:50.060
wanted to share at the top of the show.

03:50.060 --> 03:52.400
It won't take a lot of time.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.080
I met a Zune guy, Wes.

03:54.080 --> 03:56.040
You remember the Microsoft Zune?

03:56.040 --> 03:56.760
Yeah, of course.

03:56.760 --> 03:59.680
That MP3 player that didn't go anywhere?

03:59.680 --> 04:00.900
I actually owned one.

04:00.900 --> 04:02.720
I got it on a Black Friday sale.

04:02.720 --> 04:06.200
I went down with Brian Lunduke to, I think, a Kmart

04:06.200 --> 04:08.760
or, you know, like one of those type stores,

04:08.760 --> 04:10.800
like a Fred Meyers, a Kmart, a Toys R Us.

04:10.800 --> 04:12.600
I think it was maybe it was a Toys R Us.

04:12.600 --> 04:13.760
And we waited in line.

04:13.760 --> 04:15.680
This was years ago.

04:15.680 --> 04:20.160
Yes, to get a brown Zune, which I wanted, I think,

04:20.160 --> 04:21.260
for a honeymoon flight.

04:21.260 --> 04:22.880
I was going on a flight for my honeymoon,

04:22.880 --> 04:25.300
and I wanted something to watch videos.

04:25.300 --> 04:28.560
And it's interesting, though, seeing the Zune again today,

04:28.560 --> 04:30.480
because it is so huge.

04:30.480 --> 04:34.240
These things were discontinued in October of 2011.

04:34.240 --> 04:35.840
And they all have their own Zune service

04:35.840 --> 04:36.920
with its own Zune software.

04:36.920 --> 04:37.780
They are so thick.

04:37.780 --> 04:40.160
They're like two decks of cards stacked

04:40.160 --> 04:41.720
on top of each other thick.

04:41.720 --> 04:44.560
And I'm looking over at this guy.

04:44.560 --> 04:47.680
And I noticed, you know, he's got sort of a look about him,

04:47.680 --> 04:50.520
like a mid-level management look.

04:50.520 --> 04:53.840
And he sits down, and he busts out the Zune player.

04:53.840 --> 04:56.960
And the first thing that strikes me was how much of that UI

04:56.960 --> 05:01.440
is in use today, where you have a very sort of like what

05:01.440 --> 05:04.880
became sort of a famous Microsoft mobile UI really

05:04.880 --> 05:05.920
started on the Zune.

05:05.920 --> 05:07.920
So that was really fascinating to see that.

05:07.920 --> 05:10.640
But towards the end of the flight,

05:10.640 --> 05:13.040
he starts to bust out his laptop.

05:13.040 --> 05:14.400
And I can't help it.

05:14.400 --> 05:15.720
I'm sitting next to this guy.

05:15.720 --> 05:20.880
He's got a Zune player and this convertible Fujitsu or Sony

05:20.880 --> 05:22.800
Windows PC laptop.

05:22.800 --> 05:25.280
And then the guy, I'm sitting right in the middle,

05:25.280 --> 05:27.360
in coach, in the cheapo seating.

05:27.360 --> 05:29.880
And the guy that's got the Windows seat

05:29.880 --> 05:35.880
has got an iPhone XS Max, an iPad Pro, an Apple Watch,

05:35.880 --> 05:40.000
and so I've got a guy with a Zune and a Windows foldable PC

05:40.000 --> 05:42.920
next to me, and then a guy with an iPad Pro and the phone

05:42.920 --> 05:43.800
and all that stuff next to me.

05:43.800 --> 05:45.120
And I'm sitting there watching both of these two,

05:45.120 --> 05:46.760
how they use their technology.

05:46.760 --> 05:50.000
And I don't mean to pick, but the guy with the Windows PC

05:50.000 --> 05:52.960
was too big for the seat on the plane.

05:52.960 --> 05:57.880
And if you picture Kilroy or the home improvement neighbor,

05:57.880 --> 06:01.080
where they're always just like their nose up is over the fence

06:01.080 --> 06:04.680
and they're peeking, this guy had the laptop in his lap

06:04.680 --> 06:06.320
with the screen flat on his lap.

06:06.320 --> 06:09.880
And then his nose peeking over the ass of the laptop,

06:09.880 --> 06:12.400
looking at his screen down into his lap

06:12.400 --> 06:13.860
because he couldn't fit this thing.

06:13.860 --> 06:16.680
And then he keeps getting all of these Windows 10 error

06:16.680 --> 06:19.080
messages and prompts for firmware upgrades

06:19.080 --> 06:20.680
while he's watching the movie.

06:20.680 --> 06:24.080
And then the browser edge crashes on him.

06:24.080 --> 06:26.920
He has to reload it, he has to reauthorize Flash,

06:26.920 --> 06:28.520
and the movie loses his place.

06:28.520 --> 06:30.240
And I mean, I'm trying not to stare,

06:30.240 --> 06:32.920
but just watching him have to interact and like

06:32.920 --> 06:37.320
haphazardly mash the touch screen to do all of this.

06:37.320 --> 06:39.800
It was a real interesting use case.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.800
And as we landed, I lean over to him and I say,

06:42.800 --> 06:45.240
I couldn't help but notice you're using the Zune.

06:45.240 --> 06:47.240
Like, that's pretty retro, man.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.840
Like, what's the story there?

06:48.840 --> 06:53.720
He's like, not only do I use the Zune, but I have two Zunes.

06:53.720 --> 06:54.300
I said, what?

06:54.300 --> 06:54.800
You have two?

06:54.800 --> 06:56.800
Yeah, I carry two Zunes with me.

06:56.800 --> 06:59.440
Because he says, as you know, because I told him

06:59.440 --> 07:02.080
I was a former Zune owner, the power bricks for these things

07:02.080 --> 07:02.960
are huge.

07:02.960 --> 07:06.380
And so instead of packing a power brick, he packs two Zunes.

07:06.380 --> 07:08.720
And he runs one Zune down, and then he

07:08.720 --> 07:10.120
runs the next Zune down.

07:10.120 --> 07:12.160
And he hasn't synced them for like two years.

07:12.160 --> 07:14.880
But he tells me there's still an active community out there

07:14.880 --> 07:16.720
of people that love their Zunes.

07:16.720 --> 07:19.200
And I'm looking at this guy like, you've got to be kidding

07:19.200 --> 07:19.700
me.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.540
You're still rocking this thing.

07:21.540 --> 07:27.120
And as we are deplaning, he picks up a bag

07:27.120 --> 07:30.360
with Microsoft logos all over it.

07:30.360 --> 07:32.120
And I say, oh, so do you work at Microsoft?

07:32.120 --> 07:33.760
Yeah, oh, yeah, I work at Microsoft.

07:33.760 --> 07:37.280
Ah, OK, everything makes sense now.

07:37.280 --> 07:38.680
Like, my whole world was collapsing.

07:38.680 --> 07:40.240
Like, here's this guy.

07:40.240 --> 07:42.560
He's using this touch convertible PC.

07:42.560 --> 07:43.640
He's got a Zune player.

07:43.640 --> 07:45.720
Like, he must be this big Microsoft fan.

07:45.720 --> 07:46.360
That makes a lot of sense.

07:46.360 --> 07:48.060
My whole world's like, it just doesn't compute, right?

07:48.060 --> 07:49.140
But no, he's an employee.

07:49.140 --> 07:50.860
So that makes a little more sense.

07:50.860 --> 07:53.680
There's also some people out there that just don't.

07:53.680 --> 07:56.400
You and I, a lot of the people who listen to the show probably,

07:56.400 --> 07:57.360
we're upgraders, right?

07:57.360 --> 07:58.160
We want technology.

07:58.160 --> 07:59.640
We like technology.

07:59.640 --> 08:01.320
But there is a subset of the populace

08:01.320 --> 08:02.560
that they find a solution.

08:02.560 --> 08:04.000
They put in work finding it, right?

08:04.000 --> 08:05.400
Like, I spent all this money.

08:05.400 --> 08:06.920
I bought two Zoons.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.600
And they don't want to have to reinvest.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.400
They don't want to learn a new ecosystem.

08:10.400 --> 08:11.440
Yeah, I suppose.

08:11.440 --> 08:12.520
I suppose.

08:12.520 --> 08:14.680
I mean, I understand not upgrading and getting money.

08:14.680 --> 08:16.400
And that was my first impression.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.440
My first impression was kind of one of respect.

08:18.440 --> 08:20.920
Like, man, that guy is getting a lot out of that purchase.

08:20.920 --> 08:23.240
Like, I respect when you can push a piece of technology

08:23.240 --> 08:24.200
that far.

08:24.200 --> 08:26.600
There's something about that I can respect.

08:26.600 --> 08:31.080
But I have a sense it was more of an unwilling to change

08:31.080 --> 08:31.960
kind of thing.

08:31.960 --> 08:32.600
Ah, yes.

08:32.600 --> 08:35.120
Combination of loyalty and just stubbornness.

08:35.120 --> 08:35.640
Yeah.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.000
And so what he did is he just doubled down and bought two.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.040
Instead of replacing the Zoom, he just bought another one.

08:41.040 --> 08:44.040
That's a lot to manage, boy.

08:44.040 --> 08:48.720
OK, then my last travel story is I saw a side of Texas

08:48.720 --> 08:50.800
I've never seen before this morning.

08:50.800 --> 08:53.040
And I've been sold, I'm going to say it right now,

08:53.040 --> 08:55.120
a pack of lies about Texas.

08:55.120 --> 08:57.320
And I am angry, Wes.

08:57.320 --> 09:00.440
I have been told that Texas was warm and temperate,

09:00.440 --> 09:01.800
even in the winters.

09:01.800 --> 09:04.680
It is below freezing out there right now, Wes.

09:04.680 --> 09:05.640
Wait, what?

09:05.640 --> 09:06.880
It's below freezing outside.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.800
And there is a damn wind chill that

09:09.800 --> 09:12.120
makes it feel like it's 10 below freezing out there.

09:12.120 --> 09:15.200
It's an aggressive, mean Texas winter right now.

09:15.200 --> 09:19.040
So you flew hours south of here, leaving the beautiful Pacific

09:19.040 --> 09:21.000
Northwest just to be uncomfortable.

09:21.000 --> 09:25.600
Yeah, and I get the sense that this doesn't happen a lot,

09:25.600 --> 09:29.640
because everyone lost their damn minds this morning on the road.

09:29.640 --> 09:32.280
It was a commuter's battlefield.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.640
I've never seen anything like this before.

09:34.640 --> 09:36.320
It was intense.

09:36.320 --> 09:39.440
So I guess the sort of chain of events

09:39.440 --> 09:42.320
that happened is a few fire hydrants exploded

09:42.320 --> 09:43.240
because of freezing.

09:43.240 --> 09:45.120
Yeah, I mean, imagine they're not super well insulated,

09:45.120 --> 09:46.280
right, when it's normally warm.

09:46.280 --> 09:47.240
Yeah, right.

09:47.240 --> 09:49.480
So a few fire hydrants explode, which then

09:49.480 --> 09:53.840
spews water all over the road in below freezing conditions,

09:53.840 --> 09:56.360
which just started a chain of effects

09:56.360 --> 09:58.200
that really screwed traffic up.

09:58.200 --> 10:02.800
But what really blew it open was all of the train track

10:02.800 --> 10:05.680
crossing bars went down with the red lights,

10:05.680 --> 10:09.440
ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, but there's no train.

10:09.440 --> 10:12.340
All of the intersections in this entire Keller town

10:12.340 --> 10:16.400
that I'm in right now, they all had the train tracks come down.

10:16.400 --> 10:19.000
So here's Chris, bopping into work this morning

10:19.000 --> 10:20.680
because he's here to do a live stream

10:20.680 --> 10:22.440
in about a half hour or so.

10:22.440 --> 10:25.280
I mean, I had a little bit of fudge time, but not much,

10:25.280 --> 10:27.980
cutting a little close because I thought I had a 15-minute drive.

10:27.980 --> 10:30.640
And I end up getting rerouted by cops.

10:30.640 --> 10:32.440
I end up circling around for 40 minutes.

10:32.440 --> 10:35.880
Long story short, I eventually found a patch

10:35.880 --> 10:39.520
of train track intersection that had recently been shooed away

10:39.520 --> 10:40.520
by their local cops.

10:40.520 --> 10:43.240
And then they had moved on, so there was no other cars.

10:43.240 --> 10:46.120
And I was able, let's just keep it short

10:46.120 --> 10:47.820
and say I had to go into oncoming traffic,

10:47.820 --> 10:50.000
had to put my rental vehicle into four-wheel drive,

10:50.000 --> 10:53.120
and had to drive over train tracks.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.220
And me and about 30 other Texans had

10:55.220 --> 10:59.480
to drive over these tracks through the navigation guide

10:59.480 --> 11:01.240
bars, just all this crazy stuff.

11:01.240 --> 11:04.040
Then through a multiple-lane highway intersection,

11:04.040 --> 11:06.360
it was the most insane thing I'd ever seen.

11:06.360 --> 11:10.440
Texans driving in the wrong lanes, going against traffic,

11:10.440 --> 11:12.400
people doubling up in single lanes,

11:12.400 --> 11:14.640
people like me driving over train tracks.

11:14.640 --> 11:17.480
It was every Texan for themselves.

11:17.480 --> 11:20.160
It was total car warfare this morning.

11:20.160 --> 11:22.080
And that's my drive as I'm coming

11:22.080 --> 11:25.160
in to do the live stream for their big 200 announcements.

11:25.160 --> 11:27.080
I tell you what, nothing wakes you up

11:27.080 --> 11:28.480
like that kind of adrenaline rush.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.280
Wow, we are lucky to have you today.

11:30.280 --> 11:33.240
You could have died on those dangerous Texas roads.

11:33.240 --> 11:35.680
It was a side of Texas I'd never seen, Wes.

11:35.680 --> 11:36.800
It was a side of Texas.

11:36.800 --> 11:40.160
You know, it's a balmy 55 here, so come back soon.

11:40.160 --> 11:42.280
You bastard.

11:42.280 --> 11:44.640
That's my travel update for you.

11:44.640 --> 11:46.960
Man, oh, man.

11:46.960 --> 11:49.920
Let's talk about a side of Sony we've never seen before.

11:49.920 --> 11:51.840
You know, Nintendo has the Super Nintendo

11:51.840 --> 11:53.360
Classic and the NES Classic.

11:53.360 --> 11:56.060
They're these remakes of these old consoles,

11:56.060 --> 11:58.880
and they come preloaded with a whole bunch of essentially ROMs

11:58.880 --> 11:59.280
on them.

11:59.280 --> 11:59.760
Yeah, right.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.800
Turns out these old games are better than anything

12:01.800 --> 12:02.640
we come up with now.

12:02.640 --> 12:04.640
Yeah.

12:04.640 --> 12:05.560
Apparently.

12:05.560 --> 12:08.720
And it looks like following in those footsteps,

12:08.720 --> 12:11.320
Sony's going to be releasing a similar take on the PS1

12:11.320 --> 12:11.920
next month.

12:11.920 --> 12:14.840
The PlayStation Classic, you may have heard of this,

12:14.840 --> 12:17.200
it's loaded with 20 of the different ROMs.

12:17.200 --> 12:19.600
But here's something that's different than the Nintendo

12:19.600 --> 12:20.160
versions.

12:20.160 --> 12:23.520
The PlayStation Classic is going to use an open source

12:23.520 --> 12:27.600
emulator on the hardware to run Sony's games.

12:27.600 --> 12:30.680
Yeah, I guess Kotaku got some early hands-on time

12:30.680 --> 12:32.920
with this PlayStation Classic and discovered that it uses

12:32.920 --> 12:37.840
the PCSX ReArmed emulator, which is a modern version

12:37.840 --> 12:40.560
of the open source PCSX emulator that was originally

12:40.560 --> 12:44.440
developed way back in like 2003.

12:44.440 --> 12:46.480
Wow, I can't believe they've resurrected this

12:46.480 --> 12:47.480
and it's still working.

12:47.480 --> 12:50.960
I guess it actually still does a decent job of being accurate

12:50.960 --> 12:52.240
to those old games.

12:52.240 --> 12:55.400
Yeah, and in a way, it's sort of Sony saying,

12:55.400 --> 12:57.880
this emulator is better than what we could build ourselves.

12:57.880 --> 12:59.400
Nintendo went their own route.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.840
But here they're saying, this is probably

13:01.840 --> 13:03.960
the closest we're going to get to really recapturing

13:03.960 --> 13:05.680
that original experience.

13:05.680 --> 13:09.240
Now, that kind of feels like a bit of hypocrisy to me,

13:09.240 --> 13:11.640
because Sony's a bit famous for going

13:11.640 --> 13:15.880
after this type of community, the ROM community

13:15.880 --> 13:17.720
and emulators.

13:17.720 --> 13:19.600
And they've been criticized in the past

13:19.600 --> 13:21.040
as being very aggressive.

13:21.040 --> 13:24.040
And so now that very community that's, in some ways,

13:24.040 --> 13:27.200
been chased by Sony for years is calling them lazy.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.920
Like, you give us so much crap and then you use our software?

13:29.920 --> 13:31.360
You lazy bastards.

13:31.360 --> 13:33.360
There was that whole like running Linux and then not

13:33.360 --> 13:34.320
running Linux anymore.

13:34.320 --> 13:37.080
I mean, there's been a lot of Sony-related scandals.

13:37.080 --> 13:37.560
Yeah.

13:37.560 --> 13:39.400
It's also, I mean, it might just be a good testament

13:39.400 --> 13:41.240
to the quality of open source, because you

13:41.240 --> 13:44.280
would assume in-house, paid engineers, access

13:44.280 --> 13:46.280
to all the proprietary stuff, they

13:46.280 --> 13:48.040
could develop a really good emulator specs

13:48.040 --> 13:49.440
for the chips, all that.

13:49.440 --> 13:51.960
But no, I mean, it turns out that open source

13:51.960 --> 13:53.020
is the way to go.

13:53.020 --> 13:55.640
Yeah, it sort of goes back to what we talked about last week,

13:55.640 --> 13:56.720
open source by default.

13:56.720 --> 13:59.560
Also, didn't know this, but the Super Nintendo emulator,

13:59.560 --> 14:04.980
SNEX9X, one of my favorites, still alive and well.

14:04.980 --> 14:08.360
In fact, it's seen some really nice improvements.

14:08.360 --> 14:13.240
On the Linux side, the GTK version is now GTK3 ready.

14:13.240 --> 14:16.480
That means you also get Wayland compatibility

14:16.480 --> 14:17.880
fully implemented.

14:17.880 --> 14:18.680
I know, right?

14:18.680 --> 14:19.600
Yeah, that's for sure.

14:19.600 --> 14:26.600
So GTK3 and Wayland support in a Super Nintendo emulator.

14:26.600 --> 14:27.520
I am impressed.

14:27.520 --> 14:30.360
Also, yes, I mean, that's just a great emulator.

14:30.360 --> 14:32.120
Yep, recently got my son into that.

14:32.120 --> 14:35.700
And don't tell him this, because it's going to be a Christmas

14:35.700 --> 14:36.400
present.

14:36.400 --> 14:40.160
But there are some really solid Super Nintendo controller

14:40.160 --> 14:44.600
knockoffs that just show up as USB input devices to Linux.

14:44.600 --> 14:45.440
Oh, really?

14:45.440 --> 14:47.160
Yeah, and they're not very expensive.

14:47.160 --> 14:48.620
So I got him one, and I got me one.

14:48.620 --> 14:50.000
So I could try it and test it.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.360
Of course, of course, that's for the show, yeah.

14:52.360 --> 14:54.800
Right, totally professional.

14:54.800 --> 14:55.880
But yeah, it does work.

14:55.880 --> 14:57.600
And so I can't wait to give him one.

14:57.600 --> 15:00.660
And he'll plug it into his elementary OS laptop, which

15:00.660 --> 15:02.640
I just updated to Juno recently, too.

15:02.640 --> 15:04.280
So he's getting all the goodies in there.

15:04.280 --> 15:05.520
Did that go pretty smoothly?

15:05.520 --> 15:06.880
It went super smooth.

15:06.880 --> 15:08.440
And he really likes the update.

15:08.440 --> 15:10.800
He feels like he got a new computer out of it.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.640
He even feels like it's a little bit faster.

15:12.640 --> 15:14.200
He was running two releases behind.

15:14.200 --> 15:15.440
Hey, that's how it should go.

15:15.440 --> 15:18.040
Yeah, I was like, that's a best case scenario.

15:18.040 --> 15:18.880
It's great.

15:18.880 --> 15:20.680
He's really thrilled.

15:20.680 --> 15:24.160
Now, let's talk about Canonical for a moment.

15:24.160 --> 15:26.240
Mark Shuttleworth had a chat with Frederik

15:26.240 --> 15:31.440
at TechCrunch at the recent OpenStack Summit.

15:31.440 --> 15:33.600
And that's in Berlin, I believe, because we

15:33.600 --> 15:36.080
have a couple of people from Linux Academy there right now

15:36.080 --> 15:40.020
as well that are giving talks and doing project meetups

15:40.020 --> 15:41.920
and just all kinds of really cool stuff.

15:41.920 --> 15:44.100
Really well represented, actually.

15:44.100 --> 15:45.360
There's a lot of experts there.

15:45.360 --> 15:46.720
I didn't even think about going.

15:46.720 --> 15:47.480
I mean, it's in Berlin.

15:47.480 --> 15:48.240
That'd be awesome.

15:48.240 --> 15:49.680
But anyways, Mark's also there.

15:49.680 --> 15:51.440
And he had a chat with Frederik.

15:51.440 --> 15:54.680
And he says, I value my independence.

15:54.680 --> 15:56.800
He told Frederik that during a brief chat

15:56.800 --> 15:59.240
on the outskirts of the OpenStack Summit in Berlin.

15:59.240 --> 16:01.260
The outskirts in Berlin.

16:01.260 --> 16:02.760
In part, that's because he simply

16:02.760 --> 16:04.180
doesn't personally need the money,

16:04.180 --> 16:07.040
but also because he'd like to see all the way

16:07.040 --> 16:10.380
through his vision for Canonical and Ubuntu.

16:10.380 --> 16:13.160
Now, of course, it's no secret that Shuttleworth would rather

16:13.160 --> 16:16.560
like to see Canonical get an IPO.

16:16.560 --> 16:19.880
But apparently, it still needs some work

16:19.880 --> 16:21.120
to get the numbers right.

16:21.120 --> 16:26.160
I would also just say that after this whole Red Hat news,

16:26.160 --> 16:28.560
the IPO, the public company, and the Linux backing,

16:28.560 --> 16:30.940
I feel like there's a little bit of questions there, right?

16:30.940 --> 16:33.680
A private company is a little more free to, you know,

16:33.680 --> 16:36.200
make their own risks, be a little less profitable,

16:36.200 --> 16:39.040
or at least sort of choose philosophy over profit?

16:39.040 --> 16:41.160
Less so in the public space.

16:41.160 --> 16:44.520
Yeah, I mean, that's obviously why this is even coming up.

16:44.520 --> 16:47.000
You know, that's why they're asking him about this,

16:47.000 --> 16:49.480
because of the Red Hat sale.

16:49.480 --> 16:53.840
And I saw a story recently that more and more tech companies

16:53.840 --> 16:56.560
are sort of bailing on the idea of IPOing.

16:56.560 --> 16:58.560
They're just kind of, I don't know,

16:58.560 --> 17:00.160
like maybe it's coming to an end.

17:00.160 --> 17:02.440
Like, obviously, it's not coming to an end.

17:02.440 --> 17:05.240
But the hype cycle around it, like everybody rushing

17:05.240 --> 17:07.320
towards the IPO, I think, has faded.

17:07.320 --> 17:10.520
And now people are taking a calculated, really,

17:10.520 --> 17:13.160
a much more practical and realistic approach

17:13.160 --> 17:15.240
to doing an initial public offering.

17:15.240 --> 17:17.800
Right, we had this world of unicorns and other things.

17:17.800 --> 17:18.760
You get a bunch of VC money.

17:18.760 --> 17:19.680
You try to go for the IPO.

17:19.680 --> 17:21.960
You try to build this really big, successful company.

17:21.960 --> 17:23.920
But for niche players, people that

17:23.920 --> 17:25.720
aren't going to be an industrial giant,

17:25.720 --> 17:27.280
maybe that doesn't make sense.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.720
Yeah, yeah, I think that's well said, Wes, yeah.

17:29.720 --> 17:33.040
The Open Invention Network has a bit of news.

17:33.040 --> 17:35.280
This is after Microsoft joined them.

17:35.280 --> 17:39.320
And then we all started talking about that Linux system

17:39.320 --> 17:39.920
definition.

17:39.920 --> 17:42.520
It's all about the Linux system definition.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.640
Well, the Open Invention Network,

17:44.640 --> 17:47.120
which is now the largest patent non-aggression community

17:47.120 --> 17:51.520
in history, with more than 2,750 community members,

17:51.520 --> 17:53.560
has announced today that it's increased its patent

17:53.560 --> 17:57.880
non-aggression coverage through an update to its definition

17:57.880 --> 17:59.200
of the Linux system.

17:59.200 --> 18:02.120
This expansion is part of the Open Invention Network's

18:02.120 --> 18:05.760
program to regularly revise its Linux system coverage

18:05.760 --> 18:08.880
to keep pace with innovation, as they say.

18:08.880 --> 18:09.640
Right.

18:09.640 --> 18:12.760
Now, this expansion includes 151 new packages,

18:12.760 --> 18:15.160
bringing the total number of, quote unquote,

18:15.160 --> 18:19.680
protected packages to 2,873.

18:19.680 --> 18:22.960
As they say, with this update to the Linux system definition,

18:22.960 --> 18:26.160
the OIN continues with its well-established process

18:26.160 --> 18:29.040
of carefully maintaining a balance between stability

18:29.040 --> 18:32.520
and innovative core open source technology.

18:32.520 --> 18:33.320
Oh, of course.

18:33.320 --> 18:34.080
Of course, Wes.

18:34.080 --> 18:35.880
Of course.

18:35.880 --> 18:37.600
And while the majority of the new additions

18:37.600 --> 18:39.520
are widely used and found in most devices,

18:39.520 --> 18:40.960
that update also includes a number

18:40.960 --> 18:44.920
of key open source innovations, such as Kubernetes, Cassandra,

18:44.920 --> 18:47.520
and packages for automotive grade Linux.

18:47.520 --> 18:49.600
That last one, kind of surprising.

18:49.600 --> 18:51.080
Yeah, I mean, it's not bad, right?

18:51.080 --> 18:53.800
And this is directly addressing the major complaint

18:53.800 --> 18:56.600
that a lot of people had about Microsoft joining the OIN was

18:56.600 --> 18:59.440
that, well, it's only covering the stuff in that definition.

18:59.440 --> 19:01.160
Well, I think that the message they're

19:01.160 --> 19:03.160
trying to get across here with this press release

19:03.160 --> 19:06.360
is we reevaluate that definition on an ongoing basis

19:06.360 --> 19:08.800
and are open to expanding it.

19:08.800 --> 19:11.720
That must take quite the process, though,

19:11.720 --> 19:13.760
because you've got to get, I mean,

19:13.760 --> 19:16.440
don't you have to get buy-off from 2,000 members

19:16.440 --> 19:18.560
now that we're going to just all of a sudden

19:18.560 --> 19:20.120
expand this definition?

19:20.120 --> 19:21.600
That's got to be a process now.

19:21.600 --> 19:24.360
I mean, anything surrounding all of these patents, right?

19:24.360 --> 19:26.680
That's going to be a lot of lawyers, a lot of rooms full

19:26.680 --> 19:29.480
of lawyers negotiating, and that just takes time.

19:29.480 --> 19:31.520
It also kind of strikes me that we only

19:31.520 --> 19:36.400
need the open invention network because a lot of the patent

19:36.400 --> 19:38.880
system, especially in the US, it's just broken.

19:38.880 --> 19:40.040
Yeah.

19:40.040 --> 19:42.280
Yeah, and like architects pointed out in the chat room,

19:42.280 --> 19:43.920
it's not a perfect solution.

19:43.920 --> 19:45.540
It still has limitations.

19:45.540 --> 19:46.700
It's kind of a bone, right?

19:46.700 --> 19:49.160
It's a bone thrown to the open source from the big companies.

19:49.160 --> 19:51.160
Like, we have to have this because the lawyers

19:51.160 --> 19:54.640
and the executive suites say we've got to protect our

19:54.640 --> 19:56.840
intellectual property, but we also

19:56.840 --> 19:58.720
rely on all this open source technology.

19:58.720 --> 20:02.400
Yes, and you also want to give some insurance to companies

20:02.400 --> 20:04.920
that are considering building products around open source

20:04.920 --> 20:06.300
that they're not going to get sued,

20:06.300 --> 20:09.240
because that was a major topic for a long, long time,

20:09.240 --> 20:11.400
especially in the bad old days of SCO.

20:11.400 --> 20:13.640
It was a major concern.

20:13.640 --> 20:17.200
I personally had several conversations

20:17.200 --> 20:19.980
where I was trying to pitch companies on Linux

20:19.980 --> 20:22.080
and was shot down because they were

20:22.080 --> 20:24.760
concerned about being sued for using free software.

20:24.760 --> 20:27.680
And it was super hard to hear that every time,

20:27.680 --> 20:30.720
because it felt like they were buying into FUD,

20:30.720 --> 20:33.060
that companies were generating intentionally

20:33.060 --> 20:34.800
to just create doubt.

20:34.800 --> 20:37.240
And it was, I wouldn't label it as heartbreaking,

20:37.240 --> 20:39.440
but it was really hard for me to hear people say that.

20:39.440 --> 20:41.280
Right, you're like, I have this technology.

20:41.280 --> 20:42.920
You can use it for free.

20:42.920 --> 20:46.060
And then the cynicism of lawyers just shuts it down.

20:46.060 --> 20:47.480
Yes, exactly, and it was better.

20:47.480 --> 20:48.200
It was better.

20:48.200 --> 20:48.960
You can use it.

20:48.960 --> 20:50.320
It'll make my work cheaper.

20:50.320 --> 20:51.520
It'll be more stable.

20:51.520 --> 20:53.320
It is a better solution I can give you,

20:53.320 --> 20:54.280
and the software is free.

20:54.280 --> 20:55.160
It's a business move.

20:55.160 --> 20:56.600
Yes, yes.

20:56.600 --> 20:57.840
So it was really, it was hard.

20:57.840 --> 21:02.920
And so I do appreciate the need for just setting people's

21:02.920 --> 21:06.040
concerns down, just turning down the notch on the concern.

21:06.040 --> 21:08.160
I do see the need for that.

21:08.160 --> 21:12.080
I've got also kind of a concern about LastPass these days.

21:12.080 --> 21:14.440
I mean, I know we've talked about it before.

21:14.440 --> 21:15.960
And I know the general take is just

21:15.960 --> 21:17.360
try to always use free software.

21:17.360 --> 21:21.360
I wanted to give them a solid period of time

21:21.360 --> 21:24.840
after LogMe and bought them just to kind of see how things went.

21:24.840 --> 21:27.760
And as time has gone on and I just,

21:27.760 --> 21:30.640
I wanted it to go another way, but I've

21:30.640 --> 21:32.280
gotten less and less happy with LastPass.

21:32.280 --> 21:35.160
So it's with kind of a wanting eye

21:35.160 --> 21:37.040
that I've been looking at Bitwarden.

21:37.040 --> 21:40.220
And this week, they may have announced something

21:40.220 --> 21:41.960
that's going to tip me over.

21:41.960 --> 21:44.800
Bitwarden has completed a third party security

21:44.800 --> 21:46.720
audit of their software.

21:46.720 --> 21:48.360
And if you're not familiar with Bitwarden,

21:48.360 --> 21:52.760
it's a 100% open source password manager.

21:52.760 --> 21:54.940
Identity manager is probably the term they would use.

21:54.940 --> 21:56.480
And the nice thing about it is it also

21:56.480 --> 21:58.720
has a public bug bounty program as well.

21:58.720 --> 22:00.200
And they write on their blog they're

22:00.200 --> 22:02.820
pleased to announce that Bitwarden has completed

22:02.820 --> 22:06.520
a thorough security audit and a cryptographic analysis

22:06.520 --> 22:09.600
from the security experts at Cure53.

22:09.600 --> 22:11.120
Actually, it's a good step.

22:11.120 --> 22:12.440
It's not perfect.

22:12.440 --> 22:15.160
There were several issues that were identified by the audit,

22:15.160 --> 22:16.840
some with immediate impact.

22:16.840 --> 22:19.240
But the good news, all of those have

22:19.240 --> 22:21.160
been resolved in a recent Bitwarden update.

22:21.160 --> 22:24.200
Yeah, and it wasn't anything disastrous, really.

22:24.200 --> 22:25.240
I looked at it, the PDF.

22:25.240 --> 22:27.320
There's about five vulnerabilities.

22:27.320 --> 22:28.400
And they range.

22:28.400 --> 22:30.120
One of the vulnerabilities was you

22:30.120 --> 22:32.400
are allowing people to use too simple of passwords

22:32.400 --> 22:33.880
for the master password.

22:33.880 --> 22:34.600
Yeah, fair enough.

22:34.600 --> 22:38.880
I mean, that's not exactly a security vulnerability per se,

22:38.880 --> 22:40.920
but it is something they needed to change.

22:40.920 --> 22:43.000
Other things in there, there was a vulnerability

22:43.000 --> 22:45.520
with one of the browser extensions.

22:45.520 --> 22:48.360
But the core stuff all looked really good.

22:48.360 --> 22:52.920
And it's just a big moment for an open source project, right?

22:52.920 --> 22:54.960
Because that takes money, that takes community,

22:54.960 --> 22:57.340
it takes funding and commitment to development.

22:57.340 --> 22:59.320
Yeah, it is a big milestone.

22:59.320 --> 23:02.400
And it takes a lot of work, so that's awesome.

23:02.400 --> 23:04.840
I will probably be talking more about Bitwarden,

23:04.840 --> 23:05.400
I have a sense.

23:05.400 --> 23:06.120
Wes, don't you?

23:06.120 --> 23:09.200
Oh, I think so.

23:09.200 --> 23:12.760
And then one last little bit of just sort of updates here,

23:12.760 --> 23:15.040
and then we just got a couple other community things,

23:15.040 --> 23:19.200
is the LVFS project has a nice improvement

23:19.200 --> 23:20.440
coming down the pipe.

23:20.440 --> 23:22.280
They've just added an optional feature

23:22.280 --> 23:26.400
to FW update and LVS that some people may find useful.

23:26.400 --> 23:28.160
The firmware update process can now

23:28.160 --> 23:30.240
tell the user how long in seconds

23:30.240 --> 23:31.440
your update is going to take.

23:31.440 --> 23:34.600
So you'll actually get a bit of feedback on that.

23:34.600 --> 23:35.380
That's pretty cool.

23:35.380 --> 23:35.880
Yeah, right.

23:35.880 --> 23:37.380
I mean, this means that users can now

23:37.380 --> 23:40.560
know that a doc update might take five minutes or so,

23:40.560 --> 23:43.280
so they can start the process before they go to lunch.

23:43.280 --> 23:46.000
A UEFI update might require multiple reboots,

23:46.000 --> 23:48.200
could take up to an hour, 45 minutes.

23:48.200 --> 23:50.960
So the user can know, like, don't do this right

23:50.960 --> 23:52.360
before your important meeting.

23:52.360 --> 23:53.280
That is really cool.

23:53.280 --> 23:54.920
And LVFS is one of those projects

23:54.920 --> 23:57.000
that I'm going to talk with Christian about when

23:57.000 --> 23:58.120
he comes on the show.

23:58.120 --> 24:01.920
It's, I think, one of those that has

24:01.920 --> 24:05.000
checked one of those fundamental boxes on Linux.

24:05.000 --> 24:09.440
Now, only users running the very latest versions of FW update

24:09.440 --> 24:12.760
and GNOME software will be seeing the duration countdown.

24:12.760 --> 24:15.000
Older versions, it's unchanged.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.500
Nothing really doesn't work for you.

24:16.500 --> 24:18.480
It's just, you're not going to see it.

24:18.480 --> 24:20.040
And it's just ignored.

24:20.040 --> 24:23.080
Now, and of course, for people that aren't familiar,

24:23.080 --> 24:26.120
LVFS is the Linux Vendor Firmware Service,

24:26.120 --> 24:29.160
which is a great way that you can get firmware updates right

24:29.160 --> 24:29.840
on Linux.

24:29.840 --> 24:33.760
Yeah, especially these days when those chips are essentially

24:33.760 --> 24:36.520
running little micro operating systems packed

24:36.520 --> 24:38.320
full of vulnerabilities, it's pretty important

24:38.320 --> 24:39.560
that you update that stuff.

24:39.560 --> 24:40.920
It matters more than it used to.

24:40.920 --> 24:44.440
And so it's really good to see LVFS out there shipping

24:44.440 --> 24:45.440
that stuff.

24:45.440 --> 24:48.640
But Arthur writes into the show, and this is so awesome.

24:48.640 --> 24:52.000
He's looking for help with SuperTuxKart networking.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.600
He says, hi, first of all, I want

24:53.600 --> 24:56.480
to thank you for the suite of great podcasts.

24:56.480 --> 24:58.960
I've previously been a listener to several of them for years

24:58.960 --> 25:00.360
now, and I enjoy them a lot.

25:00.360 --> 25:02.600
I am representing the SuperTuxKart project,

25:02.600 --> 25:04.440
which, as you may know, is a free software

25:04.440 --> 25:05.720
and open source racing game.

25:05.720 --> 25:07.520
So I don't know if he's actually a developer,

25:07.520 --> 25:09.960
but he's representing them and focused on fun rather

25:09.960 --> 25:11.960
than realism, which probably means

25:11.960 --> 25:13.200
it would be a hit with my kids.

25:13.200 --> 25:14.760
We are nearing a new stable release

25:14.760 --> 25:18.240
with the headline feature of bold local and internet

25:18.240 --> 25:20.040
multiplayer availability.

25:20.040 --> 25:23.160
We're looking for people willing to test and compile

25:23.160 --> 25:25.680
the game from the latest sources and help

25:25.680 --> 25:29.000
test gameplay over the internet in particular.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.780
Later on, we'll announce a beta release,

25:30.780 --> 25:32.360
which will provide binaries.

25:32.360 --> 25:34.160
But at the moment, we want testers

25:34.160 --> 25:36.240
to be able to compile for themselves in case

25:36.240 --> 25:38.480
we need to debug the output or we need

25:38.480 --> 25:40.320
them to test a fix later on.

25:40.320 --> 25:44.240
He's got more information linked at blog.supertuxkart.net.

25:44.240 --> 25:46.540
And they say they'd be grateful if the listeners could

25:46.540 --> 25:48.440
help spread the word about this.

25:48.440 --> 25:51.400
You'll see it posted a few other places.

25:51.400 --> 25:53.480
And if you do read this, it'd probably

25:53.480 --> 25:56.080
be easier if you just call everyone by my nickname, Arthur.

25:56.080 --> 25:57.040
OK, very good, Arthur.

25:57.040 --> 25:57.880
We will.

25:57.880 --> 25:59.760
He says, I look forward to hearing more on Linux Unplugged.

25:59.760 --> 26:02.000
So I went over and checked out the SuperTuxKart blog

26:02.000 --> 26:04.080
as he talked about there in that email.

26:04.080 --> 26:06.920
And holy crap, Wes, they got a lot going on

26:06.920 --> 26:08.160
with this multiplayer stuff.

26:08.160 --> 26:09.000
This looks good, huh?

26:09.000 --> 26:10.440
Oh, it looks great.

26:10.440 --> 26:14.000
I mean, it has been about a year since the last release.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.360
And I would also like to say, adding network play, especially

26:17.360 --> 26:19.720
non-LAN network play, I mean, it works on the LAN too.

26:19.720 --> 26:22.280
But like, internet play with real latency,

26:22.280 --> 26:24.160
that is a significant undertaking,

26:24.160 --> 26:26.740
especially on top of a code base not necessarily designed

26:26.740 --> 26:27.880
for it.

26:27.880 --> 26:29.000
Yeah.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.680
I mean, Wimpy is really into the racing games.

26:32.680 --> 26:34.480
So this isn't like the type of racing games

26:34.480 --> 26:35.600
that Wimpy's probably into.

26:35.600 --> 26:38.760
But if you like the Mario Kart kind of racing games

26:38.760 --> 26:41.320
that are more like, it's like bowling when you

26:41.320 --> 26:43.000
have the bumpers in the lanes.

26:43.000 --> 26:43.280
Yeah, right.

26:43.280 --> 26:45.120
You don't have to just focus on realism or accuracy.

26:45.120 --> 26:46.200
You just get to go wild.

26:46.200 --> 26:46.760
Yeah, exactly.

26:46.760 --> 26:50.520
You get real drunk, you go on your go-kart course,

26:50.520 --> 26:51.560
and you have a good time.

26:51.560 --> 26:52.640
It's a great party game.

26:52.640 --> 26:53.840
It so is.

26:53.840 --> 26:56.080
Or you play it with your children,

26:56.080 --> 27:00.280
which is where SuperTuxKart fits in my gaming agenda

27:00.280 --> 27:01.080
these days.

27:01.080 --> 27:01.800
Absolutely.

27:01.800 --> 27:03.400
That's absolutely what I'll be doing.

27:03.400 --> 27:06.960
Also, what's the game called where Tux slides down

27:06.960 --> 27:07.800
on his belly?

27:07.800 --> 27:09.720
That old game that we've all been playing for years now

27:09.720 --> 27:11.240
that I've just completely blanked on the name

27:11.240 --> 27:12.200
where he's in the snow?

27:12.200 --> 27:12.980
Tux Racer.

27:12.980 --> 27:13.480
Yeah, OK.

27:13.480 --> 27:14.640
Is that just Tux Racer?

27:14.640 --> 27:15.960
Kids love that one, too.

27:15.960 --> 27:16.600
I think so.

27:16.600 --> 27:17.100
Yeah.

27:17.100 --> 27:19.800
So SuperTuxKart, pretty awesome.

27:19.800 --> 27:22.600
And we might chat more about that in the bit.

27:22.600 --> 27:24.760
It's interesting they're asking for just people that

27:24.760 --> 27:27.120
are willing to build it themselves.

27:27.120 --> 27:29.200
What do you think of that, Wes?

27:29.200 --> 27:30.880
Mostly, it's early days, and they

27:30.880 --> 27:33.320
want to be able to switch things into debug mode

27:33.320 --> 27:35.040
if you run into a problem so they can get

27:35.040 --> 27:38.360
all the necessary information to go actually investigate

27:38.360 --> 27:40.160
that, things that you would leave out

27:40.160 --> 27:41.640
in a real production build.

27:41.640 --> 27:44.320
It looks like when everything's all said and done,

27:44.320 --> 27:48.360
you'll be able to run your own SuperTuxKart server.

27:48.360 --> 27:50.000
You can host it yourself if you want,

27:50.000 --> 27:51.320
if you just want to have a nice little LAN

27:51.320 --> 27:52.480
or something like that.

27:52.480 --> 27:54.760
And they've got an IRC channel set up.

27:54.760 --> 27:57.720
It's SuperTuxKart on Freenode if you want to get in and chat

27:57.720 --> 27:58.680
with people about it.

27:58.680 --> 28:02.920
I'll also say I checked out over in the AUR,

28:02.920 --> 28:06.080
one of our favorite little user-curated repositories,

28:06.080 --> 28:10.080
and there is a SuperTuxKart-git package already.

28:10.080 --> 28:13.560
And if you go look at the package build,

28:13.560 --> 28:15.680
there's a line to use the network branch, which

28:15.680 --> 28:17.000
currently has all these changes.

28:17.000 --> 28:17.360
Nice.

28:17.360 --> 28:17.840
All right.

28:17.840 --> 28:19.320
So you need the network branch.

28:19.320 --> 28:21.400
OK, that is good to know.

28:21.400 --> 28:24.360
That's so cool that they reached out to us to talk about it.

28:24.360 --> 28:25.600
I love hearing that from them.

28:25.600 --> 28:27.360
And I hope that they do get some people

28:27.360 --> 28:30.880
to help them test it out, because that's such a fun one.

28:30.880 --> 28:32.120
And that's great.

28:32.120 --> 28:35.040
Even if we can't have AAA open source titles right now,

28:35.040 --> 28:37.640
if it's just something you get a lot of fun entertainment out

28:37.640 --> 28:38.920
of, it doesn't really matter.

28:38.920 --> 28:40.520
Well, the other thing, too, is if you're

28:40.520 --> 28:42.760
an up-and-coming person interested in both open source

28:42.760 --> 28:44.400
and game development, while it might not

28:44.400 --> 28:46.600
be the cream of the crop, here's an open source game

28:46.600 --> 28:47.440
you can go look at.

28:47.440 --> 28:49.480
You're curious how to make a networked game.

28:49.480 --> 28:51.160
Soon, you can learn from them.

28:51.160 --> 28:52.200
Absolutely.

28:52.200 --> 28:54.600
So I wanted to chat with Christian from Red Hat here,

28:54.600 --> 28:56.600
because they have a lot of desktop projects

28:56.600 --> 28:57.600
that they're working on.

28:57.600 --> 29:00.960
And I started to notice a theme across all of them.

29:00.960 --> 29:02.600
But nominally, the thing I really

29:02.600 --> 29:04.060
wanted to get them on the show about

29:04.060 --> 29:07.520
was they've just completed another PipeWire hack fest.

29:07.520 --> 29:09.960
And now the conversation is just beginning

29:09.960 --> 29:13.760
to change to, how are we going to manage the Pulse Audio

29:13.760 --> 29:15.680
replacement rollout?

29:15.680 --> 29:16.840
That's a big milestone.

29:16.840 --> 29:18.840
And so I thought, let's get Christian on the show.

29:18.840 --> 29:21.680
He just landed back in his hometown a little bit ago.

29:21.680 --> 29:24.000
And I wanted to make sure I got the name right, too.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.020
Christian, welcome back to the Unplugged program.

29:26.020 --> 29:27.000
It's been a while.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.260
And you deserve a proper pronunciation of the last name.

29:30.260 --> 29:32.560
So help me there so I don't sound like a doof.

29:32.560 --> 29:33.760
How do you pronounce the last name?

29:33.760 --> 29:36.640
I pronounce my surname Schaller.

29:36.640 --> 29:38.120
Technically speaking, I'm not sure

29:38.120 --> 29:40.000
if it's correct in the sense that it's a German surname.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.120
And I probably pronounce it in a very Norwegian way.

29:42.120 --> 29:44.000
But that's how I pronounce it.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.800
But you are located in the States?

29:45.800 --> 29:46.320
Yes, I am.

29:46.320 --> 29:49.120
I live in Westford, north of Boston.

29:49.120 --> 29:52.320
And your day job is technically working for Red Hat, correct?

29:52.320 --> 29:53.120
Yes, that's correct.

29:53.120 --> 29:55.880
I'm the senior engineering manager

29:55.880 --> 29:58.120
for the desktop team at Red Hat.

29:58.120 --> 30:00.840
OK, well, then you probably are the perfect guy to talk to.

30:00.840 --> 30:02.840
We've been emailing back and forth for a while.

30:02.840 --> 30:04.280
It's been ages since you've been on the show.

30:04.280 --> 30:06.600
But the thing that has always kind of kept you on my radar

30:06.600 --> 30:09.280
is you're often one of the forward-facing people talking

30:09.280 --> 30:11.400
about pipeline developments.

30:11.400 --> 30:13.320
We just recently had Wim on the show.

30:13.320 --> 30:18.120
And you also were with Wim at a hack fest even more recently.

30:18.120 --> 30:20.320
And so I thought, gosh, let's get Christian on,

30:20.320 --> 30:22.200
talk a little more about pipeline,

30:22.200 --> 30:26.080
but then kind of get more in towards your general day job,

30:26.080 --> 30:28.440
the Linux desktop itself, and that position,

30:28.440 --> 30:29.600
and all those things.

30:29.600 --> 30:32.760
So why don't we just start with a quick recap of the Pipewire

30:32.760 --> 30:33.360
hack fest?

30:33.360 --> 30:34.240
How did that go, man?

30:34.240 --> 30:37.200
Yeah, I thought it went really well.

30:37.200 --> 30:39.840
We got a bigger group than I actually expected together.

30:39.840 --> 30:41.040
Cool.

30:41.040 --> 30:42.500
Because my background, of course,

30:42.500 --> 30:44.480
was that Wim had been working on Pipewire for quite a while.

30:44.480 --> 30:46.360
And he felt it was time now to see

30:46.360 --> 30:48.160
if he could try to help pull in more people

30:48.160 --> 30:51.320
and sort of get a larger group working on it.

30:51.320 --> 30:53.240
Because the more people helping out,

30:53.240 --> 30:55.200
the sooner we can actually have it in production.

30:55.200 --> 30:56.160
Sure.

30:56.160 --> 30:59.120
So yeah, it was really good.

30:59.120 --> 31:01.720
We had more or less the whole core Pulse Audio team

31:01.720 --> 31:02.320
attending.

31:02.320 --> 31:05.480
And we had people from the also community.

31:05.480 --> 31:08.400
And we had multiple people representing various embedded

31:08.400 --> 31:09.440
use cases.

31:09.440 --> 31:13.280
So was that conversation being had about replacing Pulse Audio

31:13.280 --> 31:14.980
exactly kind of how that might look?

31:14.980 --> 31:16.640
Is that going over?

31:16.640 --> 31:18.000
Is that too awkward?

31:18.000 --> 31:19.120
What about that?

31:19.120 --> 31:22.200
Yeah, no, the conversation went really well.

31:22.200 --> 31:25.240
I mean, the thing is we had been talking to them long time

31:25.240 --> 31:25.740
before.

31:25.740 --> 31:28.160
I mean, Wim is actually our contributor

31:28.160 --> 31:29.120
to Pulse Audio at times.

31:29.120 --> 31:30.480
He knew the people well.

31:30.480 --> 31:32.960
It wasn't like he was like this person from outside

31:32.960 --> 31:35.520
who's suddenly jumping in saying, hey, I have this new thing.

31:35.520 --> 31:36.560
OK.

31:36.560 --> 31:40.000
So when I started to put together the hack fest,

31:40.000 --> 31:41.760
I actually reached out to Arun Raghavan,

31:41.760 --> 31:44.480
who's one of the maintainers of Pulse Audio,

31:44.480 --> 31:47.160
and said, hey, do you want to help co-host this thing?

31:47.160 --> 31:50.000
Because he and I had been talking about eventually

31:50.000 --> 31:53.220
wanting to move towards Pulse, sorry, PipeWire anyway.

31:53.220 --> 31:55.200
So he was more than happy to do that.

31:55.200 --> 31:56.640
And then we got the group together

31:56.640 --> 31:59.200
and, of course, started discussing, well,

31:59.200 --> 32:01.080
first where PipeWire is today and where

32:01.080 --> 32:03.720
it needs to go to be ready to be that drop-in replacement

32:03.720 --> 32:06.400
for both Pulse Audio and Jack.

32:06.400 --> 32:08.920
That seems like a major milestone when that happens.

32:08.920 --> 32:11.520
And in a way, it's sort of, to me,

32:11.520 --> 32:14.120
it seems like the PipeWire model is more of a Jack model

32:14.120 --> 32:16.400
than it is a Pulse Audio model.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.620
So when we replace Pulse Audio one day,

32:18.620 --> 32:20.120
people are going to see something

32:20.120 --> 32:23.000
that might be more familiar to them as Jack than Pulse Audio.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
That's kind of a transition in itself, too.

32:25.000 --> 32:28.600
Yeah, Olle, I think for, like, if you're an end user

32:28.600 --> 32:30.760
and all you use the songs are for is basically, like,

32:30.760 --> 32:34.600
playing back music or getting audio from a browser,

32:34.600 --> 32:37.080
I don't think you actually would even notice the differences.

32:37.080 --> 32:38.680
I mean, of course, the interesting thing

32:38.680 --> 32:40.240
is that this combination of things

32:40.240 --> 32:41.600
makes some interesting combinations.

32:41.600 --> 32:44.200
I mean, Tanu Kaskinen, who's another commentator of Pulse

32:44.200 --> 32:47.720
Audio, actually brought a post on Patreon recently

32:47.720 --> 32:49.480
where he talked about the hack fest.

32:49.480 --> 32:51.320
And the one thing he mentioned he thought was interesting

32:51.320 --> 32:54.000
was the fact that, you know, Jack has his tools

32:54.000 --> 32:56.200
where you can see all the different applications

32:56.200 --> 32:57.320
that Jack application is running

32:57.320 --> 32:59.480
and, you know, how they're linked together and so on.

32:59.480 --> 33:00.320
It's really cool.

33:00.320 --> 33:01.600
Yeah, and the fact that with PipeWire now,

33:01.600 --> 33:03.480
you can certainly get Pulse Audio applications

33:03.480 --> 33:05.160
into that same graph.

33:05.160 --> 33:08.440
Oh, okay.

33:08.440 --> 33:10.520
That's personally exciting to me.

33:10.520 --> 33:12.400
Yeah, and so we were basically, you know,

33:12.400 --> 33:15.600
running unaltered Jack applications

33:15.600 --> 33:17.720
and seeing, you know, Totem or Rhythmbox

33:17.720 --> 33:20.240
or whatever appear in that graph

33:20.240 --> 33:21.240
so that you can basically connect

33:21.240 --> 33:22.400
your Pulse Audio applications directly

33:22.400 --> 33:24.520
to your Jack applications.

33:24.520 --> 33:26.800
I mean, I'm sure there's sort of practical concerns

33:26.800 --> 33:28.840
where you might not necessarily want to do that

33:28.840 --> 33:30.440
just because they are not written to, you know,

33:30.440 --> 33:33.240
work in the kind of way a Jack application is meant to work,

33:33.240 --> 33:35.480
but in theory, you could, you know,

33:35.480 --> 33:37.200
connect these things together now.

33:37.200 --> 33:38.360
Hmm.

33:38.360 --> 33:42.960
This is sort of one of those bigger under the covers projects

33:42.960 --> 33:45.440
that is in the works or has been in the work

33:45.440 --> 33:47.240
semi-recently at Red Hat

33:47.240 --> 33:49.040
that is kind of what I want to talk to you about today

33:49.040 --> 33:51.680
because, okay, so you have PipeWire,

33:51.680 --> 33:55.080
which I think is just a fantastic initiative

33:55.080 --> 33:58.600
that Linux really needs for professional audio production.

33:58.600 --> 34:00.160
So I'm very excited about it,

34:00.160 --> 34:03.120
but there's been other kind of like lower level improvements

34:03.120 --> 34:04.880
that are just kind of important and needed.

34:04.880 --> 34:06.760
Like the one that comes to my mind almost immediately

34:06.760 --> 34:09.760
that I don't think people think about very often is Bolt,

34:09.760 --> 34:13.720
which is crucial for Thunderbolt security settings

34:13.720 --> 34:15.160
and having a way for the user

34:15.160 --> 34:16.560
to interact with that on the desktop.

34:16.560 --> 34:18.320
So why don't we take a second here

34:18.320 --> 34:21.600
in the context of PipeWire and some of the other initiatives

34:21.600 --> 34:23.320
that Red Hat's doing,

34:23.320 --> 34:26.120
how do we talk about the desktop in a whole

34:26.120 --> 34:29.320
as something that's just as relevant

34:29.320 --> 34:31.880
or almost as relevant as all of the other major desktops?

34:31.880 --> 34:34.520
I'm not talking about millions and millions and millions

34:34.520 --> 34:35.440
and millions of users.

34:35.440 --> 34:38.160
I'm not talking about it being the year of the Linux desktop.

34:38.160 --> 34:40.440
I'm simply saying how much work is it

34:40.440 --> 34:42.640
to get it to be a relevant desktop?

34:42.640 --> 34:44.400
One that's at the discussion table

34:44.400 --> 34:46.240
with all of the other desktops.

34:46.240 --> 34:47.680
What are your thoughts there?

34:47.680 --> 34:49.680
Yeah, so I mean, I think the way I've been thinking

34:49.680 --> 34:51.840
about it for a long time now is that,

34:51.840 --> 34:54.880
you know, we don't need to be at 50 or 80 or 90%

34:54.880 --> 34:57.320
to be, call it a player here.

34:57.320 --> 35:00.800
I think if you can get the Linux desktop up to let's say 5%

35:00.800 --> 35:01.640
or the total marketer,

35:01.640 --> 35:03.640
which I guess similar to where Mac is today,

35:03.640 --> 35:06.880
I think that's enough to make us relevant

35:06.880 --> 35:08.440
and make sure we stay relevant.

35:09.680 --> 35:11.800
And I mean, that's not necessarily too far away

35:11.800 --> 35:12.640
from where we are today.

35:12.640 --> 35:14.560
I mean, I think, you know, depending on the statistics

35:14.560 --> 35:17.960
you look at, the Linux desktop often ends up maybe around 2%.

35:17.960 --> 35:19.680
So if you're able to climb another 2%,

35:19.680 --> 35:23.280
I think that sort of brings the number where it should be.

35:23.280 --> 35:24.120
Right.

35:24.120 --> 35:25.520
Or where it needs to be.

35:25.520 --> 35:27.560
That actually seems achievable to me.

35:27.560 --> 35:28.800
Yeah, yeah, to me too.

35:28.800 --> 35:33.080
So actually when I came in about six years ago,

35:33.080 --> 35:35.520
and took over the SOP, we sort of sat down and said,

35:35.520 --> 35:37.920
hey, let's have a serious discussion about,

35:37.920 --> 35:39.760
A, where are we putting our resources today?

35:39.760 --> 35:42.240
And are we addressing the things that needs to be addressed

35:42.240 --> 35:43.920
to actually get users in?

35:43.920 --> 35:46.680
And in some sense, we thought, said like, you know,

35:46.680 --> 35:47.520
to achieve growth,

35:47.520 --> 35:49.720
you basically need to have two things happen, right?

35:49.720 --> 35:51.160
A, you need to have new people come in

35:51.160 --> 35:53.720
and you need to have existing users not leave.

35:55.720 --> 35:58.160
So we said like, let's try to look at these two.

35:59.120 --> 36:00.800
And we said like, okay, in terms of leaving,

36:00.800 --> 36:02.200
we've ended up doing some surveys

36:02.200 --> 36:03.680
and trying to figure out like,

36:03.680 --> 36:07.560
why were people leaving their Linux desktop behind?

36:07.560 --> 36:11.360
And I think what we found was the number one reason

36:11.360 --> 36:12.880
at least we could see it for people

36:12.880 --> 36:15.640
not wanting to use a Linux desktop anymore

36:15.640 --> 36:17.760
was hardware support.

36:17.760 --> 36:19.720
That, you know, after this maybe started

36:19.720 --> 36:21.120
with Linux during their university years.

36:21.120 --> 36:23.640
And then as the golden time went by,

36:23.640 --> 36:24.840
they got more and more frustrated

36:24.840 --> 36:25.680
with the fact that, you know,

36:25.680 --> 36:27.160
every time they got a new laptop,

36:27.160 --> 36:29.440
it was, you know, half a year or more

36:29.440 --> 36:32.240
where things maybe were a little bit hazy

36:32.240 --> 36:33.600
whether how well things worked

36:33.600 --> 36:35.280
or there was like always these two functions

36:35.280 --> 36:37.280
on the laptop that never worked.

36:37.280 --> 36:38.880
So we felt that, you know,

36:38.880 --> 36:40.000
A, that needed to be addressed.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.120
And then of course there were other things too

36:41.120 --> 36:42.040
in terms of like, you know,

36:42.040 --> 36:44.560
application availability and so on.

36:44.560 --> 36:47.200
But the hardware issue was something that we sort of said,

36:47.200 --> 36:50.880
okay, that's definitely where people feel the pain

36:50.880 --> 36:53.160
and get frustrated with Linux.

36:53.160 --> 36:54.680
So we basically started saying,

36:54.680 --> 36:57.120
okay, how can we reallocate

36:57.120 --> 36:58.440
all the resources we have available

36:58.440 --> 37:01.400
to try to look more on the hardware side

37:01.400 --> 37:04.200
and also try to be a bit more proactive?

37:04.200 --> 37:06.080
Because I think what often has happened also with Linux

37:06.080 --> 37:08.160
is that a new hardware feature comes along

37:08.160 --> 37:11.200
and, you know, eventually we do get support on Linux,

37:11.200 --> 37:14.720
but it's sort of like maybe a year, two after it

37:14.720 --> 37:17.280
become mainstream available in new laptops.

37:17.280 --> 37:19.840
So I think one of the first things we started looking at

37:19.840 --> 37:21.360
where we wanted to be a little bit more

37:21.360 --> 37:23.400
ahead of the curve was that we spent a lot of time

37:23.400 --> 37:25.160
working on the high DPI support

37:25.160 --> 37:26.720
to ensure that, you know,

37:26.720 --> 37:29.760
as we saw that these laptops were already on the way

37:29.760 --> 37:33.000
into the market, that it wouldn't be once again,

37:33.000 --> 37:34.880
the case that, okay, you got your brand new laptop

37:34.880 --> 37:36.280
with a high DPI screen,

37:36.280 --> 37:39.240
but you had to run it in 1080p mode

37:39.240 --> 37:41.360
because Linux didn't support anything else.

37:41.360 --> 37:42.680
Right.

37:42.680 --> 37:45.120
So we've been sort of trying to, you know,

37:45.120 --> 37:46.840
build relationships with harder vendors

37:46.840 --> 37:48.720
and start planning things up front.

37:48.720 --> 37:50.200
I mean, Bolt, I guess it's another area

37:50.200 --> 37:52.480
where we're seeing that like, hey, you know,

37:52.480 --> 37:53.760
there are going to be a lot of peripherals,

37:53.760 --> 37:56.880
especially docking stations now moving to Thunderbolt.

37:56.880 --> 37:59.240
As you said, let's put some on it

37:59.240 --> 38:00.360
and work together with the hard vendors

38:00.360 --> 38:01.800
to make sure we have an infrastructure there

38:01.800 --> 38:02.640
to handle these kind of things.

38:02.640 --> 38:04.560
Or, you know, another one that crosses my mind,

38:04.560 --> 38:06.920
I mean, it does serve a purpose in the data center,

38:06.920 --> 38:09.120
but the Linux vendor firmware service,

38:09.120 --> 38:12.760
which has been huge for those of us on laptops now

38:12.760 --> 38:15.080
that can get security firmware updates

38:15.080 --> 38:17.200
via our software update mechanism.

38:17.200 --> 38:19.720
I mean, to me, that's a massive,

38:19.720 --> 38:22.240
huge first-class desktop experience

38:22.240 --> 38:25.880
that that project is bringing to desktop Linux users.

38:25.880 --> 38:29.200
And it seems like it's kind of checking off

38:29.200 --> 38:30.600
one of those fundamental boxes,

38:30.600 --> 38:32.840
like this is a fundamental thing we need to have.

38:32.840 --> 38:34.560
Yeah, no, I fully agree.

38:34.560 --> 38:38.040
And it was also like a product that came up,

38:38.040 --> 38:38.880
I wouldn't call it randomly,

38:38.880 --> 38:42.240
but one of the people on my team is a guy called Peter Jones,

38:42.240 --> 38:43.840
who's actually a Red Hat's representative

38:43.840 --> 38:45.600
on the UFI Standards Forum.

38:46.440 --> 38:48.120
And he actually just approached me one day saying,

38:48.120 --> 38:49.880
hey, you know, it'd be really good

38:49.880 --> 38:53.960
if you can do something here to provide UFI firmware updates

38:53.960 --> 38:55.440
because, A, that's what's coming.

38:55.440 --> 38:57.320
I mean, people are moving away from the old BIOS model

38:57.320 --> 38:58.640
and switching to UFI firmware.

38:58.640 --> 39:02.000
And the thing we hadn't known for years, right,

39:02.000 --> 39:04.480
was that people, well, first of all,

39:04.480 --> 39:06.000
it was extra work for our kernel team

39:06.000 --> 39:07.800
because often they end up doing workarounds

39:07.800 --> 39:11.400
in the kernel driver to work around for firmware bugs.

39:11.400 --> 39:12.520
And in some cases, you know,

39:12.520 --> 39:13.960
people would often have a laptop and say,

39:13.960 --> 39:16.160
oh, God, Linux is broken, this thing sucks,

39:16.160 --> 39:18.160
and, you know, my battery life sucks,

39:18.160 --> 39:21.320
or, you know, my hard drive is slow, whatever.

39:21.320 --> 39:23.000
And the problem was that they didn't have

39:23.000 --> 39:23.920
an up-to-date firmware.

39:23.920 --> 39:25.920
Of course, if they had, they would have gotten a fix,

39:25.920 --> 39:29.200
you know, years ago that actually improved their situation.

39:29.200 --> 39:33.760
So, yeah, so we kicked off that LLVFS effort,

39:33.760 --> 39:36.520
and, I mean, had to give a big call out there to Dell,

39:36.520 --> 39:38.400
actually, who was one of the first major companies

39:38.400 --> 39:40.000
who came on board and said, okay, hey,

39:40.000 --> 39:42.920
we want to work with you and make sure this happens.

39:42.920 --> 39:45.520
And, of course, today it's, you know,

39:45.520 --> 39:46.760
we also have Lenovo signed up,

39:46.760 --> 39:50.000
and, of course, a host of peripheral vendors.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.520
Yeah, it's so great,

39:51.520 --> 39:54.920
especially as we get more and more software in these chips

39:54.920 --> 39:57.800
that are full-fledged machines that are doing a lot

39:57.800 --> 40:01.240
and have some security issues, potentially.

40:01.240 --> 40:05.200
And so that kind of first-party update service

40:05.200 --> 40:08.240
is just super important, maybe more than it ever has been.

40:08.240 --> 40:10.560
And in a way, I think maybe a lot of desktop users

40:10.560 --> 40:12.120
can't even really wrap their heads around

40:12.120 --> 40:15.320
because it's all just a black box to us these days.

40:15.320 --> 40:17.040
Well, you know, Christian, I feel like I'm kind of seeing

40:17.040 --> 40:18.960
a theme here, so we talk about Bolt,

40:18.960 --> 40:20.920
and we talk about the firmware service,

40:20.920 --> 40:23.400
and getting those firmware updates is super critical

40:23.400 --> 40:25.080
as these devices do more and more,

40:25.080 --> 40:27.120
and this is, like, another one of those fundamentals,

40:27.120 --> 40:28.560
but the one that really seems like

40:28.560 --> 40:30.440
the most practical compromise

40:30.440 --> 40:33.080
coming out of the Red Hat and Fedora group recently

40:33.080 --> 40:36.800
is the support for binary drivers, like the NVIDIA driver.

40:36.800 --> 40:38.720
And this is something that I think

40:38.720 --> 40:41.480
I've always kind of criticized a little bit.

40:42.320 --> 40:44.200
They made it for a bad end-user experience.

40:44.200 --> 40:46.440
You know, you buy a machine, it's got a $400 part in there,

40:46.440 --> 40:48.320
and you get about $80 of value out of it

40:48.320 --> 40:49.560
with the free driver.

40:49.560 --> 40:51.200
And that was always sort of my proposition

40:51.200 --> 40:53.840
to the Fedora camp, and the response generally was,

40:53.840 --> 40:55.760
we really want to focus on free software

40:55.760 --> 40:58.000
and building a free desktop.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.160
But as time has gone on, there have been,

41:00.160 --> 41:01.120
I don't know what else to call them,

41:01.120 --> 41:04.840
maybe compromises to make it a little more practical,

41:04.840 --> 41:07.040
to sort of check another one of those fundamentals.

41:07.040 --> 41:08.440
I'd love to know the backstory

41:08.440 --> 41:10.680
around getting those binary drivers into Fedora.

41:10.680 --> 41:14.200
Yeah, no, it came from the same thinking here, right?

41:14.200 --> 41:17.360
It's like, we know a lot of people,

41:17.360 --> 41:20.000
of course, are getting laptops or desktops for this matter

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
with NVIDIA chips, and they needed a binary driver,

41:22.000 --> 41:23.240
and it was always this pain

41:23.240 --> 41:24.800
because you had a conflict between Mesa

41:24.800 --> 41:26.400
and the binary driver.

41:26.400 --> 41:28.160
And of course, the binary driver was available

41:28.160 --> 41:30.360
only from a third-party site and so on.

41:31.800 --> 41:32.960
And we sort of said, like,

41:32.960 --> 41:35.000
hey, we are a major backers on the wall.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.280
I mean, we are the only company

41:36.280 --> 41:39.360
who actually are paying people to work full-time on the wall.

41:39.360 --> 41:41.680
But at the same time, we need to realize that,

41:41.680 --> 41:43.200
as you said, when people buy expensive hardware,

41:43.200 --> 41:45.240
they want to be able to get max use of it.

41:45.240 --> 41:48.400
And at the same time, we should then use this

41:48.400 --> 41:50.240
as a way to develop an even better relationship

41:50.240 --> 41:54.200
with NVIDIA to improve our roles on the wall, right?

41:54.200 --> 41:55.200
Right.

41:55.200 --> 41:57.440
So we started up having conversations with NVIDIA,

41:57.440 --> 41:59.120
saying, like, this is what we want to do.

41:59.120 --> 42:01.440
We want to, if step one, figure out a way

42:01.440 --> 42:03.760
to avoid this SO file conflict

42:03.760 --> 42:07.120
between Mesa and the binary driver,

42:07.120 --> 42:10.120
because it makes life hell for packagers.

42:10.120 --> 42:12.200
And end users, of course, who have to deal with the fact

42:12.200 --> 42:15.200
that, you know, they might have a package

42:15.200 --> 42:17.280
depending on Mesa and then that that gets uninstalled

42:17.280 --> 42:20.160
to deal with the NVIDIA driver and so on.

42:21.720 --> 42:24.440
So we set off a lot of discussions of projects.

42:24.440 --> 42:27.720
And of course, we did the whole GLVND project

42:27.720 --> 42:30.160
that had this vendor neutral dispatch system

42:30.160 --> 42:31.440
so you can have multiple implementations

42:31.440 --> 42:34.000
of your GL drivers and talked about, like,

42:34.000 --> 42:35.040
how can we eventually get to a point

42:35.040 --> 42:37.960
where you can support discrete graphics better?

42:37.960 --> 42:40.960
And of course, at the same time, you know,

42:40.960 --> 42:42.560
figuring out how can we also collaborate better

42:42.560 --> 42:44.920
on making sure the wall work better.

42:44.920 --> 42:46.520
So, I mean, all in all, I mean,

42:46.520 --> 42:47.840
I don't feel we're there yet.

42:47.840 --> 42:49.480
I mean, this has been an ongoing process,

42:49.480 --> 42:51.920
but I think we're miles ahead of where we used to be.

42:51.920 --> 42:55.640
And I believe that, you know, within a year,

42:55.640 --> 42:57.920
I think you will suddenly feel that, you know,

42:57.920 --> 42:59.640
these challenges around NVIDIA hardware

42:59.640 --> 43:01.840
will to some degree be a thing of the past.

43:01.840 --> 43:03.240
Interesting, I like that prediction.

43:03.240 --> 43:06.960
What I see here is a multi-team effort

43:06.960 --> 43:09.000
to solve this problem.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.520
And when you add it all up,

43:11.520 --> 43:13.640
it's a pretty sizable investment.

43:13.640 --> 43:15.000
And I'm curious, in your opinion,

43:15.000 --> 43:17.480
being inside Red Hat now for six years,

43:17.480 --> 43:20.240
what do you sense the value is to Red Hat

43:20.240 --> 43:22.720
to invest in these particular areas?

43:22.720 --> 43:24.920
You know, the desktop for Red Hat

43:24.920 --> 43:26.200
isn't almost a special product.

43:26.200 --> 43:27.840
I mean, you know, Red Hat was actually started

43:27.840 --> 43:29.160
as a desktop Linux company.

43:29.160 --> 43:30.920
I mean, I think people tend to forget that these days,

43:30.920 --> 43:32.920
but you know, the original starting of Red Hat

43:32.920 --> 43:35.600
was being a desktop operating system.

43:38.520 --> 43:39.760
And to this day, though,

43:39.760 --> 43:43.080
to see the desktop as a valuable asset,

43:43.080 --> 43:45.160
not necessarily as a revenue generating one,

43:45.160 --> 43:47.360
but you know, it's important in terms of like,

43:48.880 --> 43:51.080
just training people to use Linux.

43:51.080 --> 43:54.000
I mean, a lot of people who today work as sysadmins

43:54.000 --> 43:56.400
or developers around a lot of companies around the globe,

43:56.400 --> 43:57.880
I mean, they got their start with Linux

43:57.880 --> 43:59.720
through running a Linux desktop.

43:59.720 --> 44:00.560
Absolutely.

44:00.560 --> 44:02.040
Mm.

44:02.040 --> 44:03.160
So for us, it's more like, you know,

44:03.160 --> 44:05.520
the more people have using Linux on a desktop,

44:05.520 --> 44:06.760
then the more people are available

44:06.760 --> 44:09.320
for both us and our customers and partners to hire

44:09.320 --> 44:12.120
who has, you know, experience and knowledge around Linux.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.520
That is an interesting answer.

44:14.520 --> 44:17.200
I hadn't considered the education angle.

44:17.200 --> 44:21.640
That is playing the long game, but it is a smart one.

44:21.640 --> 44:23.960
I guess my only other question to you would be,

44:23.960 --> 44:25.840
is there anything else you wanna mention

44:25.840 --> 44:28.000
or send the audience to something going on?

44:28.000 --> 44:30.320
Is there any resources you'd like to inform people

44:30.320 --> 44:32.760
about because you guys are working on a ton of good stuff

44:32.760 --> 44:34.480
and some of it deserves a lot more attention

44:34.480 --> 44:35.800
than it's getting.

44:35.800 --> 44:37.720
Yeah, I mean, one of the projects we're currently doing

44:37.720 --> 44:40.320
that I'm pretty excited about is called Silverblue.

44:40.320 --> 44:43.920
I think you have covered it before on your show,

44:43.920 --> 44:45.640
which is basically this idea of trying to make

44:45.640 --> 44:48.600
an image-based operating system out of Linux

44:48.600 --> 44:50.760
or for the Linux desktop.

44:50.760 --> 44:54.120
Because I think what we are concerned going back to

44:54.120 --> 44:55.880
when we looked at, you know, the problems people have,

44:55.880 --> 44:58.200
right, and that is this recurring problems

44:58.200 --> 44:59.640
that upgrades are not seamless.

44:59.640 --> 45:01.040
So of course, I think we've done a lot of work

45:01.040 --> 45:02.160
over the last five years for Dora

45:02.160 --> 45:03.280
to make it a lot more seamless.

45:03.280 --> 45:04.920
And I think it mostly works now,

45:04.920 --> 45:07.360
but the problem still often happens, right,

45:07.360 --> 45:10.920
is that time goes by and you install that, you know,

45:10.920 --> 45:12.880
random package that you found on some website

45:12.880 --> 45:17.640
that, you know, provides application or feature you wanted.

45:17.640 --> 45:20.440
And that package starts creating problems

45:20.440 --> 45:21.800
when you try to go to the next version,

45:21.800 --> 45:23.960
because it, you know, depends on an SO file

45:24.920 --> 45:27.120
that has changed versioning or whatever.

45:27.120 --> 45:29.920
So we, of course, well, I guess we have two efforts

45:29.920 --> 45:31.040
trying to address that problem, right?

45:31.040 --> 45:33.800
One is of course, Flatpak, which is, you know,

45:33.800 --> 45:36.480
this core effort of trying to make application bundles

45:36.480 --> 45:39.720
that of course keep most of their dependencies with them,

45:39.720 --> 45:42.320
just to avoid this problem of migrating.

45:42.320 --> 45:43.920
And of course, for Reddit,

45:43.920 --> 45:46.400
Flatpak brings another valuable feature, right?

45:46.400 --> 45:48.200
Which just means that we can have one package

45:48.200 --> 45:50.360
that targets both Fedora and RHEL.

45:50.360 --> 45:51.520
We don't need to like, you know,

45:51.520 --> 45:53.320
rebuild Firefox, for instance, for each.

45:53.320 --> 45:56.080
Of course, yeah.

45:56.080 --> 45:58.000
So that's part of the story, but at the same point,

45:58.000 --> 46:01.120
we felt that, you know, we still want an upgrade set up

46:01.120 --> 46:02.600
where that's sort of rock solid.

46:02.600 --> 46:03.960
And that's sort of where Silverblue comes in,

46:03.960 --> 46:05.960
where we can say that, hey, we have an image of the core

46:05.960 --> 46:08.880
and all the packages that are part of that core

46:08.880 --> 46:10.440
are upgraded as a group.

46:10.440 --> 46:12.640
So we can basically upgrade, you know,

46:12.640 --> 46:15.160
call it oversight, verify that everything works

46:15.160 --> 46:17.440
and that there's no scripts or anything that messes up.

46:17.440 --> 46:19.960
And then just ship that as an altered image

46:19.960 --> 46:21.880
to place on your computer.

46:21.880 --> 46:23.760
My goal is that, A, more people want to try Linux

46:23.760 --> 46:24.760
because it works better.

46:24.760 --> 46:27.480
And at the same point, less people leave

46:27.480 --> 46:28.760
because they have problems with it.

46:28.760 --> 46:30.960
That's sort of where we're coming from.

46:30.960 --> 46:32.280
And I guess to cover another thing

46:32.280 --> 46:33.800
that I know was sort of a little bit covered

46:33.800 --> 46:35.480
in some stories recently was that, you know,

46:35.480 --> 46:39.440
it's been announced now that we're not doing KDE in RHEL 8.

46:39.440 --> 46:41.120
Ah, yes, right.

46:41.120 --> 46:43.200
In fact, I did want to chat with you about that.

46:43.200 --> 46:45.280
And well, there's a couple of things to make clear.

46:45.280 --> 46:48.560
One thing is that, yes, we're not supporting running KDE

46:48.560 --> 46:50.240
as a desktop, but we're still supporting people

46:50.240 --> 46:52.360
running KDE applications on RHEL.

46:52.360 --> 46:54.800
So that's an important distinction to make.

46:54.800 --> 46:56.360
But, I mean, one thing I went back to

46:56.360 --> 46:57.400
when we started to look at, like,

46:57.400 --> 47:00.560
why are people leaving Linux?

47:00.560 --> 47:02.400
And I guess you could say that, you know,

47:02.400 --> 47:04.440
if there's one area where Linux

47:05.840 --> 47:07.400
beats every other operating system,

47:07.400 --> 47:10.120
it's in the number of desktops available for it.

47:10.120 --> 47:11.240
Yeah, that's for sure.

47:12.800 --> 47:14.880
Yet, of course, as we see, it doesn't mean

47:14.880 --> 47:16.200
that we have a sort of, like, you know,

47:16.200 --> 47:17.480
taken over the market based on that.

47:17.480 --> 47:19.600
So I think we've sometimes concluded that, you know,

47:19.600 --> 47:23.200
having a choice of desktops isn't really what drives

47:23.200 --> 47:25.800
adoption or retention, for that matter.

47:25.800 --> 47:27.600
And it's quite costly to maintain,

47:27.600 --> 47:29.600
because, for instance, for my team then,

47:29.600 --> 47:31.440
who maintains all the desktops in Red Hat,

47:31.440 --> 47:33.160
it's sort of thinking, it's like, well,

47:33.160 --> 47:34.840
first of all, the most horrible message

47:34.840 --> 47:36.560
you can give any customer or user, right,

47:36.560 --> 47:38.280
is like, oh, if you want to do that,

47:38.280 --> 47:39.760
then you switch to this desktop environment.

47:39.760 --> 47:40.760
But if you want to do that,

47:40.760 --> 47:42.680
then you switch to that environment.

47:42.680 --> 47:45.800
And if you want to do both, then you have a problem.

47:45.800 --> 47:48.480
So we said, like, no, we need to be able to say,

47:48.480 --> 47:50.760
this is what you support, and this is when we get requests

47:50.760 --> 47:52.920
from users for features, where we'll implement those.

47:52.920 --> 47:55.520
And at the same point, in order for me to be able

47:55.520 --> 47:57.480
to move quickly on these things and do projects

47:57.480 --> 48:00.640
like Pipewire and Flatpak and Silverbill and all those things,

48:00.640 --> 48:02.160
I need to be able to do them both,

48:02.160 --> 48:04.200
as opposed to sort of feel that we have to re-implement

48:04.200 --> 48:06.520
the feature, you know, two, three, four, five times,

48:06.520 --> 48:07.920
depending on how many desktop environments

48:07.920 --> 48:09.280
we are supposed to support.

48:09.280 --> 48:10.840
That seems like a tight line to walk, though,

48:10.840 --> 48:12.440
because at the same time, if you want something

48:12.440 --> 48:14.880
completely universally accepted, of course,

48:14.880 --> 48:16.800
you'll need the Plasma desktop to be on board

48:16.800 --> 48:18.240
with Pipewire as well.

48:18.240 --> 48:19.720
So there's a line to walk there.

48:19.720 --> 48:20.720
There is, definitely.

48:20.720 --> 48:23.160
And I mean, the thing is, of course, we are still actually,

48:23.160 --> 48:26.480
you know, despite the plan to not ship with the KD desktop

48:26.480 --> 48:29.400
in Relate, we are still contributing to KD,

48:29.400 --> 48:31.440
especially, of course, in this area that we care about.

48:31.440 --> 48:34.600
So Jan Grulish, who's a member of my team,

48:34.600 --> 48:38.440
he attended a tech fest for Pipewire in Edinburgh,

48:38.440 --> 48:40.120
and he's the one who's been working on making sure

48:40.120 --> 48:43.440
that we have full Pipewire support in KD.

48:43.440 --> 48:44.640
That's great, that's great.

48:44.640 --> 48:47.800
I mean, but it really, I mean, to steal a business metaphor,

48:47.800 --> 48:50.400
which everybody loves, it really feels like it's about

48:50.400 --> 48:52.800
putting all of your wood behind a single arrow.

48:52.800 --> 48:54.680
You know, like, it's about focus.

48:54.680 --> 48:55.960
Yeah, it's about focus, and that's it.

48:55.960 --> 48:58.120
So it wasn't like, you know, an anti-anything.

48:58.120 --> 49:00.280
It was more like, hey, we need to focus our resources,

49:00.280 --> 49:03.240
which are limited, on solving what we know

49:03.240 --> 49:06.520
we are costing as customers, and as opposed to, you know,

49:06.520 --> 49:10.800
trying to keep a small subset of people happy

49:10.800 --> 49:13.560
by offering them, like, this choice of desktops,

49:13.560 --> 49:16.320
which, as I said, doesn't seem to be actually

49:16.320 --> 49:19.080
what drives people to adopt an operating system.

49:19.080 --> 49:21.880
Yeah, yeah, I could see it maybe keeping people around

49:21.880 --> 49:23.840
every now and then, you know, if some desktop environment

49:23.840 --> 49:26.080
has just failed you, and instead of switching back

49:26.080 --> 49:28.680
to Windows, you could switch to Plasma and be happy.

49:28.680 --> 49:30.360
That could be a potential, but I see what you're saying.

49:30.360 --> 49:33.080
People aren't coming over to Linux and going,

49:33.080 --> 49:35.400
oh boy, after I spend a week picking my distribution,

49:35.400 --> 49:36.520
I get to spend another two weeks

49:36.520 --> 49:37.800
picking my desktop environment.

49:37.800 --> 49:41.200
Yay, that's not a big advertising point.

49:42.520 --> 49:44.360
No, and of course, as I said, like, I mean,

49:44.360 --> 49:46.680
we had cases in the past, right, where people were

49:46.680 --> 49:49.040
dumping desktops basically to, like, you know,

49:49.040 --> 49:51.280
hey, multi-monitor is working better here than there,

49:51.280 --> 49:53.000
but then I discovered that my Wacom tablet

49:53.000 --> 49:55.120
worked better there than here, and then of course,

49:55.120 --> 49:57.040
it puts a customer in an impossible situation, right,

49:57.040 --> 49:58.160
because it's sort of like, well,

49:58.160 --> 50:00.000
and I have to choose that feature versus that,

50:00.000 --> 50:02.880
and then we are on the other side sort of struggling with,

50:02.880 --> 50:05.240
like, well, I don't have enough engineers available

50:05.240 --> 50:07.560
to fix both this and that, so what we're doing here,

50:07.560 --> 50:10.000
and then people also might think that features

50:10.000 --> 50:11.440
haven't been fixed because they're, let's say,

50:11.440 --> 50:13.680
using the wrong desktop environment compared to the one

50:13.680 --> 50:15.280
where we implemented the fix and this kind of thing,

50:15.280 --> 50:19.000
so it's like, it's a challenging problem to overcome.

50:19.000 --> 50:22.120
Yeah, well, Christian, I really like the approach

50:22.120 --> 50:22.960
that you're taking here.

50:22.960 --> 50:26.000
It's sort of, you know, shave away at these rough edges

50:26.000 --> 50:29.760
and make the desktop just relevant in the marketplace.

50:29.760 --> 50:32.400
Don't necessarily chase the market share number.

50:32.400 --> 50:34.120
Just make the Linux desktop relevant,

50:34.120 --> 50:35.280
and I think we're close,

50:35.280 --> 50:38.320
and that seems like an actual attainable goal,

50:38.320 --> 50:40.000
and I think you guys are playing a big part

50:40.000 --> 50:42.120
of getting us there, so thanks for coming on.

50:42.120 --> 50:44.160
Thanks for keeping everybody informed on what you do

50:44.160 --> 50:45.960
and traveling around to participate

50:45.960 --> 50:47.760
at those hackfests and whatnot.

50:47.760 --> 50:50.240
I'll have links to the blog and other things.

50:50.240 --> 50:52.720
Anywhere else you want to shoot people to check out?

50:52.720 --> 50:55.040
No, I mean, once again, I actually would like to say that,

50:55.040 --> 50:57.280
you know, of course, yes, we are doing a lot of work there

50:57.280 --> 50:58.920
and trying to fix it, but I mean, there's other people,

50:58.920 --> 51:00.520
I think, doing critical work to these days.

51:00.520 --> 51:02.120
I mean, once again, I would like to actually

51:02.120 --> 51:04.760
give a shout out to Dell for all their recent efforts.

51:04.760 --> 51:06.720
I mean, I guess we're the first major maker

51:06.720 --> 51:09.920
who got serious about Linux on the laptops,

51:09.920 --> 51:11.360
and then, of course, in addition to those,

51:11.360 --> 51:14.160
we have, you know, smaller but thriving businesses

51:14.160 --> 51:16.200
like System76 and Purism and so on,

51:16.200 --> 51:18.920
who are also pushing Linux on laptops forward

51:18.920 --> 51:21.520
and making that a more reliable experience.

51:21.520 --> 51:24.200
And I mean, another thing that I often felt held us back,

51:24.200 --> 51:25.840
and we knew we got feedback from people

51:25.840 --> 51:27.400
saying that they ended up using

51:27.400 --> 51:29.040
or keeping Linux around for was gaming,

51:29.040 --> 51:31.160
and of course, Valve has been doing an incredible effort,

51:31.160 --> 51:33.680
in my opinion, getting Steam going on Linux

51:33.680 --> 51:36.080
and making sure we have a huge selection of games.

51:36.080 --> 51:38.200
It really is a full-spectrum community effort.

51:38.200 --> 51:39.600
Well, Christian, thanks for coming on the show

51:39.600 --> 51:40.440
and chatting with me.

51:40.440 --> 51:41.520
Yeah, my pleasure.

51:41.520 --> 51:44.880
I really like talking to him because it's a reminder

51:44.880 --> 51:46.880
of all of the things that I use every day

51:46.880 --> 51:48.960
that they're working on,

51:48.960 --> 51:51.000
and that is more important than ever

51:51.000 --> 51:56.240
in the context of the news with the IBM purchasing Red Hat.

51:56.240 --> 51:58.320
And, you know, that was sort of what I was getting at, too,

51:58.320 --> 52:01.600
with what's the value to Red Hat for these projects.

52:01.600 --> 52:05.920
And so I enjoyed that entire conversation with Christian.

52:05.920 --> 52:08.000
You can find links to his blog and other things

52:08.000 --> 52:11.680
in our show notes at linuxunplug.com slash 275,

52:11.680 --> 52:15.680
including his most recent post about the PipeWire Hackfest,

52:15.680 --> 52:18.640
which I know Wes and I are super excited about PipeWire.

52:18.640 --> 52:19.480
Oh, boy.

52:19.480 --> 52:20.440
Yeah.

52:20.440 --> 52:23.040
Well, Wes, we should keep moving right along

52:23.040 --> 52:27.440
because on the Christmas list for me this year

52:27.440 --> 52:29.560
is a Thunderbolt 3 dock.

52:29.560 --> 52:31.600
I think I'm gonna do it.

52:31.600 --> 52:33.800
Ideally, I'd like to do one

52:33.800 --> 52:35.800
that even maybe has a GPU or something.

52:35.800 --> 52:38.720
Like, I've got all of these embedded right in there,

52:38.720 --> 52:40.320
just stock ready.

52:40.320 --> 52:41.160
Yeah, ready to go.

52:41.160 --> 52:43.040
Thunderbolt aspirations big time over here,

52:43.040 --> 52:45.480
but I don't know exactly what to expect,

52:45.480 --> 52:47.880
where the Linux compatibility is at.

52:47.880 --> 52:51.560
So what I'd like to do is let Wimpy take all of the arrows

52:51.560 --> 52:53.120
on some of these hardware purchases

52:53.120 --> 52:55.200
and then check in with him.

52:55.200 --> 52:57.800
We'll learn from his mistakes.

52:57.800 --> 52:58.920
Exactly.

52:58.920 --> 53:00.520
Or successes, or successes.

53:00.520 --> 53:03.120
Yeah, I know Mr. Wimpress has recently become

53:03.120 --> 53:08.120
a proud owner of a ThinkPad P1, a beautiful new rig.

53:08.280 --> 53:11.120
And I believe he has tied that with a Thunderbolt dock.

53:11.120 --> 53:12.360
And I'd just love to get your take

53:12.360 --> 53:13.800
on how this is going, Wimpy.

53:13.800 --> 53:15.600
Yes, so I have.

53:15.600 --> 53:19.680
And I've been using the dock for about a week now.

53:20.600 --> 53:24.320
So I've got a ThinkPad Thunderbolt 3 dock

53:24.320 --> 53:26.280
and it's the second gen unit.

53:26.280 --> 53:31.280
All right, so you went with a Lenovo branded dock.

53:31.280 --> 53:33.080
I did, and I will explain why.

53:33.080 --> 53:37.800
So technically there is a single umbilical cord

53:37.800 --> 53:41.280
that connects the laptop to the dock.

53:41.280 --> 53:45.680
But what Lenovo have done is made a connector

53:45.680 --> 53:49.760
on the laptop side, which is a single connector,

53:49.760 --> 53:54.400
but actually bridges the power port

53:54.400 --> 53:57.280
and the first Thunderbolt port.

53:57.280 --> 54:01.280
And then that connects to the Thunderbolt port

54:01.280 --> 54:02.720
and connects the same way on the back.

54:02.720 --> 54:07.000
So it connects into a power port and a Thunderbolt port.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.840
So technically two cables,

54:08.840 --> 54:11.960
but one umbilical cable to connect the thing together.

54:11.960 --> 54:14.160
Okay, all right, that's nice.

54:14.160 --> 54:17.000
And is that delivering a higher wattage?

54:17.000 --> 54:19.280
Yeah, right, because you can only deliver

54:19.280 --> 54:21.600
a hundred watts over Thunderbolt 3.

54:21.600 --> 54:25.320
So insufficient for a laptop with a Xeon processor

54:25.320 --> 54:28.320
and a discrete graphics card.

54:28.320 --> 54:30.880
So that's why you have to sort of provide power

54:30.880 --> 54:32.400
and Thunderbolt.

54:32.400 --> 54:35.560
Okay, and so this allows you to what, hook up Ethernet,

54:35.560 --> 54:37.800
USB devices, like what's the port layout on this thing?

54:37.800 --> 54:40.200
And what's the capabilities that it brings you?

54:40.200 --> 54:43.200
Because these things are, over here at least,

54:43.200 --> 54:47.680
nearly $400 US, is it worth it?

54:47.680 --> 54:50.800
Well, it depends what you're going for, in my opinion, yes,

54:50.800 --> 54:53.720
because it now makes for a very convenient way

54:53.720 --> 54:56.160
to connect and disconnect the laptop.

54:56.160 --> 54:58.320
So this laptop is now going to be

54:58.320 --> 55:00.440
my main workstation and laptop,

55:00.440 --> 55:04.440
and I will just disconnect it from all of this gubbins

55:04.440 --> 55:07.040
via one cable now to take it out with me

55:07.040 --> 55:09.680
when I go out and travel and work.

55:09.680 --> 55:10.880
Yes.

55:10.880 --> 55:14.400
But the first thing you have to do is use Bolt,

55:14.400 --> 55:18.520
which of course you talked about in your last interview.

55:18.520 --> 55:22.000
So Bolt is the mechanism by which you actually authenticate

55:22.000 --> 55:25.640
your Thunderbolt device so that it is now trusted.

55:25.640 --> 55:27.840
So you run that to connect that,

55:27.840 --> 55:29.960
and there's command line utilities,

55:29.960 --> 55:34.040
and if you're using GNOME, then that's all built into the UI.

55:34.040 --> 55:35.080
Hmm.

55:35.080 --> 55:36.280
And then once you've done that,

55:36.280 --> 55:39.560
on the back of this Thunderbolt dock,

55:39.560 --> 55:44.280
there are two full-size DisplayPort connectors.

55:44.280 --> 55:47.280
There are two HDMI connectors.

55:47.280 --> 55:52.880
There's a plethora of USB 3.0 A ports,

55:52.880 --> 55:55.840
and there is Gigabit Ethernet,

55:55.840 --> 55:58.240
and on the front,

55:58.240 --> 56:01.040
it's got USB-C and headphone,

56:01.040 --> 56:04.080
and it's an audio interface.

56:04.080 --> 56:05.600
And is that everything?

56:05.600 --> 56:07.280
I think that's most of the things.

56:07.280 --> 56:09.000
And Linux is pretty cool with all that stuff

56:09.000 --> 56:10.240
just appearing and disappearing.

56:10.240 --> 56:11.440
It's not really a big deal.

56:11.440 --> 56:13.640
Yeah. So I've just been, I mean,

56:13.640 --> 56:17.120
I think back to my days when I had a Commodore 64,

56:17.120 --> 56:19.360
and you used to have to sort of turn the computer off

56:19.360 --> 56:21.360
when you wrenched the cartridge out,

56:21.360 --> 56:23.440
and that sort of baked into my DNA.

56:23.440 --> 56:26.320
So I think, can I really just, you know,

56:26.320 --> 56:30.080
yank this out and it'll all carry on working?

56:30.080 --> 56:31.720
And it turns out it does.

56:31.720 --> 56:34.880
So yes, I just pull it out,

56:34.880 --> 56:36.560
and the screen has a little bit of a dance

56:36.560 --> 56:39.640
as everything sort of collapses down to one screen

56:39.640 --> 56:41.440
on the laptop lid again.

56:41.440 --> 56:43.840
But yes, it all works fine.

56:43.840 --> 56:45.880
The one area where I've had to do

56:45.880 --> 56:49.720
a little bit of sort of hackery

56:49.720 --> 56:54.720
is I've got two external 1440p monitors,

56:55.600 --> 57:00.600
and the internal panel on this laptop is UHD.

57:00.920 --> 57:05.440
So you run into this mixed DPI environment

57:05.440 --> 57:09.760
where one of the DPI's is going to be dominant.

57:10.720 --> 57:14.840
And what I've done there is I've written a little script

57:14.840 --> 57:16.920
that manipulates XRender.

57:16.920 --> 57:21.840
So it enumerates what monitors are attached.

57:21.840 --> 57:24.080
It lays out the monitors in the right order.

57:24.080 --> 57:26.160
So effectively, I've got the monitors in front of me,

57:26.160 --> 57:31.040
left and right, and then the laptop sits right

57:31.040 --> 57:32.960
in the middle between the two of them.

57:32.960 --> 57:36.280
And this XRender layout actually positions

57:36.280 --> 57:39.840
the laptop monitor in the center of the crease

57:39.840 --> 57:43.560
where the two monitors line up and uses the correct offset.

57:43.560 --> 57:46.320
So as you drag down, as you move down,

57:46.320 --> 57:49.920
you're directly moving into where you'd expect the mouse

57:49.920 --> 57:52.840
to appear on the laptop lid beneath you.

57:52.840 --> 57:56.800
And then I use some scaling in XRender

57:56.800 --> 58:01.280
to basically make that internal panel,

58:01.280 --> 58:05.800
the effective resolution, approximate to 1080p.

58:05.800 --> 58:10.800
So that now means that I've got effectively the same DPI

58:11.080 --> 58:13.120
across all three of those machines.

58:13.120 --> 58:16.080
Now, there isn't a UI that enables you

58:16.080 --> 58:19.320
to facilitate that in X at the moment,

58:19.320 --> 58:24.360
but using XRender, it is possible to create that.

58:24.360 --> 58:25.680
So yeah, I have this little script

58:25.680 --> 58:28.280
that just checks periodically,

58:28.280 --> 58:31.000
sees which panels are detected,

58:31.000 --> 58:34.040
and adjusts itself accordingly.

58:34.040 --> 58:35.160
I know it's sort of a small script,

58:35.160 --> 58:36.520
but have you thought about tossing it up

58:36.520 --> 58:37.880
on your GitHub or something?

58:37.880 --> 58:39.720
Because that's something I might use.

58:39.720 --> 58:41.880
Yeah, well, I was discussing this with Popey earlier,

58:41.880 --> 58:45.160
and the first thing he said is, I want it at the moment.

58:45.160 --> 58:48.680
It's very much sort of hardwired to my screens

58:48.680 --> 58:52.120
because it's my display IDs, it's my resolutions,

58:52.120 --> 58:55.600
the offset calculations are all hardwired,

58:55.600 --> 58:59.160
but I think I'll put it up as a gist

58:59.160 --> 59:01.520
and just sort of document what it's doing,

59:01.520 --> 59:04.600
and then other people can try and take advantage of that

59:04.600 --> 59:06.520
and figure out how to reuse it.

59:06.520 --> 59:08.400
But ultimately, what we need to do

59:08.400 --> 59:13.400
is make the display arrangement UIs

59:13.520 --> 59:16.040
in the desktop environments be smart enough

59:16.040 --> 59:21.040
to be able to accommodate these more exotic display layouts.

59:21.160 --> 59:22.600
Absolutely, especially as this becomes

59:22.600 --> 59:25.120
more and more possible, there's gonna be lots of laptops

59:25.120 --> 59:26.800
with Thunderbolt 3 ports.

59:26.800 --> 59:29.560
So if I recall correctly from a couple episodes ago,

59:29.560 --> 59:32.280
you got the Thunderbolt 3 workstation dock,

59:32.280 --> 59:37.280
which Lenovo sells for $356 here in the States.

59:37.280 --> 59:39.760
Now, this is where I'm torn, because you're right,

59:39.760 --> 59:40.880
it's a beautiful dock.

59:40.880 --> 59:44.720
It's got two HDMI, two DisplayPort, Ethernet,

59:44.720 --> 59:46.200
and it's got that bigger connector,

59:46.200 --> 59:48.000
which delivers more power.

59:48.000 --> 59:53.000
But Lenovo also sells a Thunderbolt 3 dock for $362

59:55.400 --> 01:00:00.400
that has a few less ports, but has a GTX 1050 built into it.

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:05.680
So I would go from Intel graphics to getting a 1050

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:07.560
when I plug in that Thunderbolt dock.

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:10.920
Now, I grant you, a 1050 is not gonna rock my world,

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:13.560
but it's better probably than the Intel embedded.

01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:14.920
And that's really tempting.

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:17.400
Do you think that would possibly even work?

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:18.520
Yes, I know it will work,

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:21.920
because when I have this dock attached,

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:26.920
I have a single additional Thunderbolt port spare,

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:30.320
and I've been able to connect my Razer Core to that

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:34.880
and use the 1080 Ti in that to amplify things.

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:37.120
Now, as it happens, this laptop also has

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:39.480
Quadro P2000 discrete graphics in it,

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:43.000
which is more or less equivalent to a 1050.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.760
And the 1050 isn't to be sneezed at.

01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:47.320
I was just using it to play Horizon Chase Turbo

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:48.800
before we came on air this evening.

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:51.000
It's not the most demanding game in the world,

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.960
but it was flying along at plenty of frames a second

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:55.440
and was very enjoyable.

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:56.520
That's what I was thinking.

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.160
Like, I could play a game,

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.480
and all I have to do is plug in my dock.

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:03.840
So, and it still has a couple of DisplayPorts.

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:07.080
I think it has two DisplayPorts on it, but only one HDMI.

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.080
Right, right.

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:10.360
Yeah, I mean, I'm only ever gonna use two monitors.

01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:12.680
I don't have space for any more monitors than that here,

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:14.800
and the ones I've got are plenty big enough.

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:16.600
I might give it a go and report back

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:18.520
on how that GPU integration works with Linux, too,

01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:20.040
just after some testing.

01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:22.000
Yeah, and I can explain, you know,

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.520
the way that that actually works is,

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:26.960
I've written an applet for Marte to make this easy,

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:31.400
but the way you use it is you just run the Nvidia settings,

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:35.120
and there's even a switch to take you to the right portion

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.440
of the settings where you can just flip-flop

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:38.960
between Nvidia and Intel.

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:40.480
Ah, good to know.

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:41.440
Thank you, sir.

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:45.160
Well, I always like learning vicariously, as they say.

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.760
It's the least expensive way to learn.

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:50.400
It really is, and maybe we can pass it along.

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:53.840
But, you know, I've got dozens of USB devices connected here.

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:57.560
You know, webcams, the mic, the USB audio device,

01:01:57.560 --> 01:01:59.280
multiple keyboards, mice.

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:04.280
A bunch of other stuff, controllers, all sorts of things.

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:07.360
And now, I just have one cable to connect,

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:11.280
and the monitors and all of those devices just power up.

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:12.240
That is the dream.

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:14.880
One cord, and it's powered, data, everything.

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:17.240
It's stuff, and it's no longer just on the USB bus.

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:18.560
It's on the PCI bus now,

01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:20.600
so we're talking, like, real hardware, too.

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:22.520
It's on the PCI bus, yeah, yeah.

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:24.960
So, yeah, this is not too shonky.

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:29.800
So, there's four PCI lanes available to that hub,

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:33.640
to that dock, rather, to deliver all of those pieces.

01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:36.000
Obviously, the more displays and things

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.480
and the more bandwidth you're using,

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:39.640
but it runs really nicely.

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:41.280
I've had no problems with it at all.

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:44.560
Hmm. I'll put links to both the one that Wimpy got

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:47.400
and the one that I'm going to grab and try out in the show notes,

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:49.880
if you guys want to check that out, linuxunplugged.com,

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:51.840
slash 275.

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:54.520
How's that P1 treating you? Is it going good so far?

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:56.520
Yes.

01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:58.800
Well, that doesn't sound like a super yes, though.

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:01.800
Well, you know, I'm an early adopter,

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:04.000
so you can always expect problems, can't you?

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.760
So, there are two issues.

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:09.920
These issues will be the same for ThinkPad P1 owners

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:13.640
and ThinkPad X1 Extreme owners.

01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:17.920
The first one's minor, and that's that the...

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:21.520
what do you call it? Fingerprint sensor scanner thing

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:23.720
is not currently supported.

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:25.040
Oh, of course.

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:27.040
So, that's a minor issue.

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:30.520
The other one that's a bit more interesting is

01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:35.320
hybrid graphics don't work on this at the moment,

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:39.000
and I spent the weekend having a poke around

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.200
with the GPU manager,

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:45.920
and I've got a hacked up monkey patched thing here

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:48.200
where I've kind of got it half working.

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:51.200
So, where I say half working,

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:53.920
it means that I don't have black screens

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:54.920
and I can't do anything.

01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:57.320
I actually get the displays to initialize,

01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:00.320
but I'm not at the moment able to switch between

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:02.320
hybrid and discrete graphics.

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:04.320
But I'm a bit further forward in that,

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:05.520
you know, when I first tried to use it,

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:06.920
I just had black screens,

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:09.520
and now I have screens that function.

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:13.520
Well, yeah, that is a bit further forward.

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:14.520
You're right. Okay.

01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:15.520
Yeah.

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:16.520
Well, that's good.

01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:18.520
Well, I wish you luck there on your journey, sir.

01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:19.520
I would love to know how it goes.

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:21.520
Yeah, it wouldn't be fun if it didn't have a few problems.

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:23.520
You don't feel like you own a computer

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:25.520
until you've solved some of these little gremlins.

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:26.520
You know, I've been there,

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:29.520
where there's times where I buy sort of the ambitious system,

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:31.520
and then there's times where I buy the really practical system

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:33.520
that I know is going to be taken out of the box and get to work,

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:36.520
and it just sort of depends on what you want to get out of that system,

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:38.520
and the ones where you eventually get them working

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:40.520
are sort of rewarding in themselves

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:42.520
because it's like an accomplishment.

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:46.520
Now, we have just a couple of bits of business to take care of

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:48.520
before we get out of here for this week.

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:50.520
We won't spend a lot of time on it this week,

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:56.520
but the official voting is now opening for our automation system.

01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:00.520
You can find the link in our show notes.

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:01.520
Go give your vote.

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:03.520
We'll deal more into that next week,

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:05.520
but if you want to get the early vote in,

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:07.520
you can find the link to our new system.

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:09.520
But I just wanted to take a second

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:13.520
and talk about a really cool tool that Wes found this week

01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:16.520
that he's actually already managed to put into work,

01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:19.520
and I think it was from an email from a listener, Brandon,

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:20.520
that tipped you off.

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:22.520
Yes, that is right.

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:26.520
Brandon wrote in to us and was asking if we'd ever heard of the Junest project.

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:28.520
I don't know if I'm saying that right,

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:32.520
but J-U-N-E-S, or Jailed Under Nest.

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:36.520
It essentially lets you run Arch Linux with fake root access.

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:38.520
It really uses PRoot,

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:42.520
but that basically means you get a whole little user space Arch install.

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:43.520
You don't need root.

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:44.520
All you need is a home dir,

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:48.520
a little bit of modifications to your path, and git.

01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:51.520
But you probably already have all of those things,

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:54.520
and now you have all of the Arch packages, the A-U-R,

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:56.520
and that wonderful package manager, Pac-Man.

01:05:56.520 --> 01:06:00.520
Right there on top of any distribution you want to use.

01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:04.520
Is that what you used to try out the SuperTuxCart build?

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:05.520
Yes, it is.

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:07.520
I mean, because it was already in the A-U-R, right?

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:09.520
That's one of the nice things about Arch,

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:13.520
even in the days of Snap packages and Flatpak and all that.

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:15.520
Arch just has a lot of packages.

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:18.520
And if you're like me, I mean, I just spent so many years on Arch.

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:21.520
Even though a lot of my systems are Ubuntu these days,

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:22.520
I'm familiar with it.

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:25.520
It's easy, and a lot of times you kind of just get that minimal baseline.

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:28.520
You don't have to worry about a whole bunch of different extras you need to do.

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:29.520
It's all right there.

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:30.520
It's up to date.

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:31.520
You get the latest.

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:34.520
And now with Junist, you can have it all in a throwaway environment.

01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:35.520
That's pretty neat.

01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:36.520
That's pretty neat.

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:38.520
Thank you to Brandon for tipping us off to that,

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:41.520
and thanks, Wes, for kicking the tires and giving that a go

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:42.520
while I'm out and about.

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:44.520
Junist, Arch on Linux without root.

01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:46.520
We'll have a link in the show notes for that as well.

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:49.520
Go get more poppy and wimpy.

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:54.520
Mark as well at the Ubuntu podcast, ubuntupodcast.org.

01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:56.520
A special shout out to producer Michael

01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:59.520
for helping us out with our mumble room disaster

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:01.520
we had right before the show.

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:05.520
Go get his great This Week in Linux on YouTube,

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:07.520
and go get more Wes Payne.

01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:10.520
He's over there at techsnap.systems

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:12.520
for another podcast that he's on with us,

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:16.520
and he's over on the Twitters at Wes Payne with a Y.

01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:17.520
Oh, that's right.

01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:18.520
Payne with a Y.

01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:19.520
Yeah.

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:22.520
I'm at Chris LAS, the network's at Jupiter Signal.

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:26.520
Thanks so much for joining us, and we'll see you back here next Tuesday.

01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:58.520
You know what?

01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:01.520
So producer Michael in the chat room says,

01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:05.520
Chris LAS, could you not have given the option of cast-a-blast-a?

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:08.520
I had that same thought when I looked at that list.

01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:11.520
I thought we should just maybe call it cast-a-blast-a

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:13.520
because that was the first podcast we ever did.

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:14.520
It's too perfect.

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:16.520
Yeah, it does seem like it'd be really perfect,

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:19.520
but then I thought we're creating name collision

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:22.520
with like a piece of our history maybe,

01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:24.520
or it's an homage.

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:25.520
I don't know.

01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:53.520
So I just sort of dropped it.

01:08:53.520 --> 01:09:22.520
So I just sort of dropped it.

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:51.520
What are you linking me?
