1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,260
Breaking news from Sholo, Arizona, 18 years in the making. Wes, you're on the scene now.

2
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,260
What are you learning?

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:16,940
Well, Chris, developing at this hour, Linux users can now rest easy. The ancient, convoluted

4
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:23,940
SCO versus IBM legal mess that sought to determine who owns Unix, and perhaps who has a claim

5
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:32,160
over our beloved Linux, may be about to end, with IBM agreeing to pay 14.5 million dollars.

6
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,840
If this goes through, after all that's happened, it seems like a heck of a deal. At least compared

7
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:47,440
to what they paid for Red Hat.

8
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,080
Hello friends and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show. My name is Chris.

9
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,080
My name is Wes.

10
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,440
Hello Wes, and say hi to Brent too.

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,440
Hello hello.

12
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,240
Hello Brent. This episode is brought to you by Cloud Guru, the leader in learning for

15
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,600
Coming up on the show today, sometimes things just don't go as planned. Today, we'll talk

16
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,160
about a backdoor we had to build into the studio that we set up after our Wirecard server

17
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:22,160
went down. It's a remote rescue, and one of our favorite open source tools is going to

18
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:27,480
save the day. And it is a special edition of the show because we're recording early,

19
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:34,880
off air, in between storms here in Sholo, Arizona. We decided to do it a day early this

20
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,120
week, so that way Wes could go camping, and so that way I can make the final push into

21
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:45,240
Tuxin, Arizona, also known as Tucson, where hopefully, hopefully I'll get my RV slides

22
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,160
finally fixed. My living room has been broken since May, and my kitchen slides and going

23
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:55,760
out. It's a long story. So today I'm in Sholo at the Bison Golf Club is where I've been

24
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,680
parked. It's really nice here.

25
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,680
Have you seen any bison?

26
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:06,080
No, but I have seen golfers about the size of a bison. No, unfortunately, it's stormy.

27
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,920
I'm kind of like this strange signal vortex zone to some of my devices are working. Some

28
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,560
of my devices aren't, even when they're on the same carrier. I'll have two AT&T devices

29
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,240
right next to each other. One's working, one isn't. Verizon just comes and goes. There's

30
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,800
no Sprint service here at all. The only kind of working one right now is T-Mobile, but

31
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,600
it's dropping packets. So really kind of rough. It seems like overall older devices are connecting

32
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:36,680
more, but at least I'm I'm in Arizona in precious, precious shade where it is not crazy hot.

33
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:44,160
I'm like up in the northeastern area, I guess you could say. And it actually is a reasonable

34
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:50,800
like 80 degrees here. But you know, when the show goes on, and Wes, you're about to go

35
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,800
camping.

36
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,120
Indeed. Don't worry, though. It's not as easy. I'm having some difficulties too. Originally,

37
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,920
I was planning this camping trip to go up in the North Cascades, an area I know you

38
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,920
love a lot, Chris.

39
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,760
It's a beautiful area. It's one of my favorite spots to go.

40
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,200
Unfortunately, it's basically on fire. So we've pivoted at the last minute. I'll cancel

41
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,480
all of our bookings got some new bookings over in the Mount Rainier area. I'm definitely

42
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,880
looking forward to some time away out in nature. But it is a struggle.

43
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,620
Mount Rainier is not a bad way to go. And then Brian, you just got back from being out

44
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,640
in nature. In fact, you are at the world's highest elevation koa.

45
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:31,520
Yeah, I since leaving you I just couldn't help but have that desire to go back to a

46
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:36,000
way. So everybody loves an RV campground. You got to get a fix.

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,960
Well, Heather and I found a pretty cool one that was just an hour away. And it turned

48
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:46,040
out to be the tallest. Well, I guess highest altitude at 10,000 feet, which is I thought

49
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,700
was gonna be really great until I couldn't sleep at night because I was gasping for air

50
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,700
all night.

51
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,700
Oh, really?

52
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,680
So, well, I'm not used to the Colorado Heights yet, I guess.

53
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,240
Lowland Brent. Good to know.

54
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:02,560
Yeah, you need like an adjustment period when you go up to 10,000 feet. If you go because

55
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,560
Denver is what? 5,200?

56
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,560
Yeah, Colorado Springs, like 60, 62 or something like that.

57
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,000
Right. So then you go from 6,200 up to 10,000 feet. You need to stop like at the 8,000 feet

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
and hang out for like a day or two.

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,920
Yeah, no one told me this and everyone else seemed to be fine with it. But apparently

60
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,120
I am just sensitive.

61
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,200
You're just hooked on that oxygen sucker.

62
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:29,120
Yeah. Just spend years smoking and then your lung capacity is normalized to be reduced

63
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,440
and you're fine, you know?

64
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:36,400
Oh, that's the ticket. Anyways, we had a campfire, which I never thought, but also suffers from

65
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,600
like lack of air. So that's a little harder to get going than normal. But it was a great

66
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,320
fun experience. I would totally recommend it. It was in a place called Cripple Creek,

67
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,560
if anyone's looking for it.

68
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,240
Great. I have kind of learned a little bit about the difficulty in moving high volumes

69
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,760
of air just when it comes to vehicle cooling, like when you're climbing passes and stuff,

70
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,280
the vehicle has to work harder to move air across the radiator and that kind of stuff.

71
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,760
So it's a serious deal. Maybe next time you can go up for a couple of days and adjust

72
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,480
or something. But I'm glad you were able to make it back down the mountain to join us.

73
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:12,680
We have a little bit of community news to get into. Not a ton, but one of our favorite

74
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:20,160
tools out there, Ventoy, has a nice little update starting with version 1.0.36. It has

75
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,520
a web based user interface. Hmm.

76
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,860
Yeah, Ventoy is already pretty darn amazing, especially if like us, you want to try the

77
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,820
latest and greatest distros as soon as they come out. Or maybe you're just a distro hopper

78
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:36,120
by trade and you love having a thumb drive of Clonezilla and rescue disks, but you don't

79
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,240
want to have to keep overriding that disk all the time. Ventoy is the tool for you.

80
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,960
You just plug it in, you run their little script on it, and you've got it going. But

81
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,320
you have to be a little more comfortable with the command line. And that's where this new

82
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,440
web GUI comes in.

83
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,840
Yeah, a web UI. At first I was like, why? Because they already have a standard graphical,

84
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,820
they have a command line. But then I thought, you know, actually, I could see this being

85
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:03,000
useful on a headless system. Maybe you want to be able to produce these Ventoy installs.

86
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,320
Like for example, our studio server, which is down at the moment, we'll get to that more

87
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,640
in a moment. I store all the ISO images we use centrally on there. So you could see maybe

88
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:15,200
kicking off a process like this from the NAS that already has all your ISO images too.

89
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,460
And then you copy them over to the new Ventoy creation.

90
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,720
Something that saves me a trip to the garage I will take.

91
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,200
It looks like they're just including that new Ventoy script. You just run ventoyweb.sh,

92
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,980
fires up a web server on local port 24680. And then you just point your web browser over

93
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:35,440
to it. Easy peasy. Something we'll play with probably when I get back. But I wanted to

94
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,080
mention in the meantime, there has been a new website launched by the GNOME project

95
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:46,880
designed to highlight GNOME apps. It features a curated overview all built in the GNOME

96
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,160
philosophy. So applications that really sort of embrace the GNOME design. It looks like

97
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,480
a pretty good list.

98
00:06:53,480 --> 00:07:00,440
Yeah, Sophie Harold announced today that apps.gnome.org is coming online. They hope that with apps

99
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,880
for GNOME, it will increase participation in the different apps and projects, lower

100
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,880
the barrier for getting involved with the GNOME project. And it's just one place to

101
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,320
host up to date information on GNOME applications and some stuff that might not fit over at

102
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,320
Flat Hub.

103
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:20,400
To be honest, when I saw this, my first reaction was like, well, why is the GNOME project making

104
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,760
a competitor to Flat Hub? Like, do we need two application directories? But as I dug

105
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,720
through the site, I realized they're actually adding something new here. They feature a

106
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,440
lot of apps I've never even really seen before. And it kind of builds the case that they have

107
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,880
an ecosystem and then they point to their wider ecosystem, the circle as they call it.

108
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,960
And then what they are doing, which I appreciate is when they have an app that they listed

109
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,320
is available on Flat Hub, they are linking to that Flat Hub page.

110
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,120
That's great because that's probably how I'm going to install it anyway.

111
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,880
One of my questions is how are people going to find the website if they haven't found

112
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,880
the apps yet?

113
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:58,120
I guess maybe because they're just browsing around the GNOME website. I don't know.

114
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,440
Maybe something that in future documentation, you know, they'll have be a handy link there

115
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,240
of a place to get started. But you're right. That's probably an open question.

116
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,320
The magic of SEO. Maybe that's how.

117
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:14,520
Linode.com slash unplugged. Go there to get one hundred dollars in credit, 60 days on

118
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,240
a new account and you go there to support the show. It lets them know you heard about

119
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:22,440
it here and our show is worth Linode's time. And that also helps us, you know, keep going.

120
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,600
That really is a year into being independent. That really is a note I like to hit right

121
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
now.

122
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,800
And I think Linode is a perfect partner for us to work with. I can easily and enthusiastically

123
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,760
recommend them. We use them through and through for so much stuff. Our daily production now

124
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:42,000
is weaved into Linode and it's obvious you get 11 data centers to choose from. They have

125
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,040
super fast rigs, very fast network connections. They are their own ISP and all of that is

126
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,640
backed by the best customer support in the business. And when that matters, man, does

127
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,880
that matter? Like makes all the difference. I mean, when your system is down, good customer

128
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,840
support. Well, that's going to make it or break it, isn't it? And at every step of the

129
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,000
way since Linode started in 2003, they've asked themselves how they can use Linux to

130
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,280
accomplish their next task. That love and dedication is baked into the product. And

131
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,280
if you're a longtime Linux user, you're going to notice that kind of stuff. As long timers

132
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,080
can tell, you know, you can sniff it out when somebody really knows the product or when

133
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:22,280
they're just using it to make a buck. I just recently set up a box for some backup services

134
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:27,640
in case our studio server went down, which it is down right now. I'll tell you more about

135
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,280
that in a little bit. And it was just invaluable. I turned the box off. I didn't leave it running.

136
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,680
As soon as I realized the studio server was down, I logged in my Linode dashboard, turned

137
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,000
it on and got the essentials back up and going again. I also use Linode to prototype ideas

138
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,720
for the show or services before we launch them. And you'd be surprised what you can

139
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,400
get done with a $5 a month Linode. And their prices is 30 to 50% cheaper than major cloud

140
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,480
providers out there. So it's totally worth your time to look at it with $100, you're

141
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,480
going to really be able to kick the tires. I mean, that's real money. So head over to

142
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,040
Linode.com slash unplugged, get that $100 for your new account and try this stuff out

143
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,800
go build something, try out an open source project you've always wanted to play with,

144
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,880
or maybe learn something. And I think you'll be impressed with the entire thing that eventually

145
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,820
you're going to put something into production. There are a lot of ways to host something,

146
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:16,240
but there's no company like Linode out there doing it independent since 2003 investing

147
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,140
in community events and projects and supporting your favorite Linux podcast. Go see why we

148
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:29,080
choose Linode every single time we deploy something Linode.com slash unplugged.

149
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:34,760
When I woke up this morning, I had a bad feeling about today. Now there's a lot going on. I'm

150
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,900
still not packed for my camping trip. But the thing that really told me something or

151
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:44,760
maybe a few things were off was this voicemail.

152
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:52,240
Good morning, Mr. Payne. We made it to Arizona. We are actually just a little bit outside

153
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,720
of Flagstaff. I think we're in a town called Show Low. Anyways, all the reason why that

154
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:02,760
matters is because I have horrible cell service here. So I'm not actually positive, but I

155
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:09,200
I think WireGuard is down at the studio. I'm wondering if you could check from your landline

156
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,840
connection because it could just be that I'm having carrier issues here, but I suspect

157
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:19,600
WireGuard's down and well, that's going to be a problem for the show we have later today.

158
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,040
So good morning and let me know what you see.

159
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,720
And from what I heard, WireGuard was indeed down. Indeed, the whole server seems to be

160
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:34,080
down at this point. So from what we can piece together and it's still, you know, rough at

161
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:40,760
this point is it seems that maybe about five days ago, just as we finished the last batch

162
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,480
of productions that use the studio because we record some stuff like self-hosted and

163
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,940
LAN just direct person to person. We don't go through the studio, but all the live shows,

164
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:54,840
they all go through the studio. And it seems like the day after we finished doing our last

165
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,720
batch of live shows, the power went out at the studio for a little bit. No idea why at

166
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,280
this point, but any system that wasn't on a UPS seems to have rebooted all around the

167
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:08,040
same time. And we don't have a complete picture at this time, but it appears that the studio

168
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,840
server did not come back online for some reason. And so as a result of a bunch of other things

169
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:17,060
also being down WireGuard, which also runs on that same server is down for us, which

170
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:21,040
is how we manage the live stream, which is how we manage the mixer and all of that when

171
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,960
we're on the road. How we manage everything. Yeah. And we knew the server was on shaky

172
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,480
ground. So, you know, we put some thought into a plan B. It just turns out we ended

173
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:34,460
up needing to put that plan B into production in a way we didn't expect. Of course, fake

174
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:39,480
news had to die just after we'd used it last. We discovered it earlier. I mean, I could

175
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,360
have just gone up to the studio and at least investigated, but we didn't realize till we

176
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,960
needed it again, a.k.a. this morning when we were already out of time. And I think that's

177
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:54,060
kind of showing the limitations of our centralized VPN model. It's kind of a classic setup, right?

178
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:58,240
We've got one box that's running the VPN. It's sort of the ingress point for the entire

179
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,640
studio network. Most of the time that works pretty darn well. Honestly, it's worked pretty

180
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:08,160
darn well for this whole trip. And we do have a few alternate back doors, but honestly,

181
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,560
they all come with a fair bit of downside. Yeah, a couple of our go to easy ones. If

182
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:18,200
I've really been liking Rust Desk, I've only recently on this trip realized that it seems

183
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:23,240
that the T-Mobile network actually blocks the Rust Desk connection. I don't know why,

184
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,480
but Rust Desk is like a great open source team viewer alternative. That's been killer.

185
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,560
And then sometimes we'll just use something simple like an SSH jump host. And our favorite

186
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,660
little maneuver there is to configure a system D service that keeps that connection alive.

187
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:42,880
So if that SSH connection drops or the box reboots, system D actually reconnects back

188
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:49,640
up to our Leno jump host. And that is a quick and easy way in. But you know, I can't really

189
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,360
manage everything with those options. It also means you need a little bit of infrastructure

190
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,240
on your side, right? You got to remember the commands to get through the jump host or otherwise

191
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,840
you're manually SSHing through a few different things. That's not great when you're trying

192
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,000
to connect on the one device, which is probably an iPad for some reason that you have available

193
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,240
to get back into the studio. Yeah, that actually did happen this time. I have devices that

194
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,480
just aren't working, but the iPad was one of them that does have a built in connection

195
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:18,640
and is working, but it's kind of useless for that stuff. You know, okay, great. Well,

196
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,800
I can do nothing with that connection. I can't even tether. So it was it was definitely one

197
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,760
of those moments where I felt very limited by the set of circumstances because if I could

198
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,180
fire up WireGuard on that tablet, I could at least manage the mixer. The funny part

199
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:34,240
here too, right is that we don't actually I mean, it'd be nice for fake news to be online

200
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,040
for a variety of reasons, but we don't actually need it for what we're trying to get done

201
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,580
today. And that's where we want more connectivity. I want to be able to just jump from whether

202
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:48,720
it's on my laptop, whether I'm just on my phone, I want a backdoor into the studio.

203
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:55,320
What comes to mind for us is a tool we played with way back in Episode 329, Nebula. The

204
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,120
last time we talked about Nebula on the show, it really clicked with people. There's some

205
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,060
topics that really take hold of a chunk of the audience and Nebula was definitely one

206
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:08,120
of them. Kelvin wrote into the show, he said he never looked back since we first talked

207
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,120
about it.

208
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,060
Yeah, Kelvin writes, I use it to put all my extended family's computers on the same network.

209
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:18,320
So if and when they have any issues, I can do something. Back when I heard about Nebula

210
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,760
the first time you covered it in 2019. I gave it a try and never looked back. I mostly use

211
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,280
it for support, but occasionally we copy files back and forth like photos shot in raw or

212
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:33,600
duplicity backups. Performance wise, I doubt I pushed any boundaries, but no interactions

213
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,800
feel slow beyond the initial connection. I don't think there were any usable phone apps

214
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:44,120
back when I first installed it, but they do exist now. It's been rock solid ever since.

215
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,840
That said, there are some issues you might run into. Not sure if it has built in system

216
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:54,240
D integration yet, but writing a system D unit file was simple enough. I also had one

217
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,420
oopsie moment when the certificate I generated expired before I could update it. Those issues

218
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:04,680
aside, Nebula single handedly enabled me switching a whole house load to Linux because they could

219
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:09,120
always bother me and I could help remotely.

220
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:15,660
I mean, the simplicity of having everything on one virtual LAN, even just for friends

221
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:21,880
and family is powerful. It's just so straightforward. It's really simple. But then you imagine

222
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:27,920
tying in multiple data centers together or multiple facilities like maybe the RV, the

223
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,160
studio and a machine at Wes's house and you could really start to see how Nebula can be

224
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,320
powerful and it has some built in firewall stuff inside Nebula as well.

225
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,280
Yeah, that's one of the things that really stood out to me was you could have multiple

226
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,360
use cases. And I mean, Chris, you've got a whole mobile house that you might want to

227
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,040
have access to whenever you want. I've got machines over here. We've got a whole bunch

228
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,980
of studio machines and things running on the node. And it can just be complicated, right?

229
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:57,120
We haven't integrated all of those things into a cohesive network right now, especially

230
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,760
not with WireGuard because, well, we need a lot of different tunnels set up. There are

231
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:06,960
some WireGuard mesh solutions, but Nebula, it was designed with that exact use case in

232
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,960
mind.

233
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,240
Yeah. And one of the other things I think you and I both really like about Nebula is

234
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:16,920
it brings together a lot of existing concepts and technologies, you know, existing encryption

235
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:21,920
standards, security groups, certificates, tunneling. It brings each one of those individual

236
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:27,320
pieces together in a way that hasn't really been packaged up before. And then they just

237
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:31,060
make it really simple to distribute it. Like on most systems, it's just a go binary you

238
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:34,820
can run. I mean, you can take it further than that if you want. But they've built something

239
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:39,140
that's really pretty powerful and it kind of results in something that is greater than

240
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:45,440
its individual parts. And Nebula providing a simple way to do mesh networking is fantastic.

241
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,320
And it has this facility called a lighthouse. And I'm not sure if we're still using that.

242
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,380
So could you kind of explain our setup, Wes, since I know you did a little bit of hacking

243
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,240
around on it this morning to get things back up and get us back in the studio?

244
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,620
Yeah, the lighthouse. Well, it's quite an evocative name, isn't it? And it is there

245
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:06,200
sort of acting as the beacon connecting all of these nodes. Things get tricky, especially

246
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:12,340
when you have a lot of network address translation or NAT involved. And so ideally, you use these

247
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:17,440
lighthouses on a few boxes that you can have some control over the firewall setup and ideally

248
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,200
have a publicly exposed IP address. So what do we use for that? Well, of course, Linode.

249
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:27,220
And actually, we had a backup lighthouse going on fake NAS, although that's not working right

250
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:32,660
now. The nice part is you can have multiple lighthouses. And that just makes your network

251
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,940
more robust. So you could also you know, if you wanted to have you already had a separate

252
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,460
cloud provider, maybe you've got something at a family or a friend member's house. Those

253
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:43,820
are all nice options. You just need them to have some static IPs. You can configure to

254
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:47,740
say, Hey, look, this is where it lives. I know if I'm trying to talk to this node on

255
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:52,540
the network, I can bootstrap myself by first talking to that lighthouse node. That will

256
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:56,820
help me punch through all of the NAT and get established connections that are peer to peer

257
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,740
to actually go SSH into, say, our recording machine at the studio.

258
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,220
So let's talk a little bit more about the groups aspect of net build. Because if I recall,

259
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:08,860
you've set up some studio machine groups. There's like a Chris machines group, I imagine

260
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,720
there's probably a West machines group. So that way, I don't go around fooling around

261
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,660
with your stuff. Yeah, that's a really handy functionality that's just built right in.

262
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:20,620
It's quite modern. It seems to be inspired by a lot of say, like, AWS is I am policies

263
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:25,020
modern ways that you can control access and in cloud environments, or just in diverse

264
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:29,020
networks. Because if you think about it, it's great to have all of your machines on one

265
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:33,820
flat network. But you might really not want all of your machines talking to everyone else.

266
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:38,340
Nebula, you can build that right in when you're setting up a new machine, you're generating

267
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:42,540
their key pairs, getting the search all set up setting up the config, you can actually

268
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:48,420
bake it in with the cryptography to say, this new host, they are a part of these groups

269
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:53,460
and then other members on the Nebula network in their configurations, they can decide which

270
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,820
hosts in which groups they want to allow. So we can have rules that say, anyone in the

271
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,800
recording group can SSH to all the machines in the studio that you might need while trying

272
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,420
to record a show. Or I could say like, Hey, I want to be able to stream certain things

273
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,320
from my house when I'm on the road. But well, Chris never needs to do that. So my machines

274
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,620
won't let you in. But they'll always let say, my Android phone in.

275
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:17,620
I like that a lot. And that's a that is an example of something that enterprise could

276
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:21,480
use for differentiating different server groups. If they were, say, connecting multiple data

277
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,460
centers together. I'm always kind of looking at it from that angle. Joe P wrote into the

278
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:31,180
show, he's really mastered nebulous, as we talked about it last, and he shared some tricks,

279
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,740
some tips, and some cons that he's run into.

280
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:38,740
Yeah, Joe P writes, my main concern with it is what feels like the snail's pace of development

281
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:44,120
since nebula has become a defined networking project. There's incidents and pull requests

282
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:49,020
piling up that get pretty much no attention. The second issue is that the documentation

283
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:54,300
isn't at all good. The third issue is it's slower than something like wired guard.

284
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:59,060
Okay, let's pause there and address these here. I think the issue about it not getting

285
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:03,220
a lot of fixes and the development being slow. I've noticed that a little bit myself, but

286
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:09,140
that also feels like what happens when a project kind of becomes a mature project, part of

287
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,140
something like the defined networking project, don't you think Wes?

288
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:16,580
Yeah, you know, it is new, they were able to start up a new company to sort of shepherd

289
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:21,700
nebula development. But you're right, the most recent release was in May, and that is

290
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,720
a little while and there are a lot of issues. Now, I haven't really gone through myself

291
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,740
and sort of triage and assessed how many of these are issues in expected functionality

292
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:33,200
and how many of these are things that would be nice to have. There's also just some stuff

293
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,100
in there with people with really tricky net situations that nebula tries really hard to

294
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:41,420
bust through, but you can't beat every single firewall or carrier grade net out there, unfortunately.

295
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:45,860
Yeah. And to your point, they did do a release back in May. I mean, that's not so bad. And

296
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:49,740
then there's the performance part, you know, Joe P points out that it's slower than wire

297
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,380
guard. And I just think there's no denying that wire but wire guards a performance beast.

298
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:58,780
I mean, that's one of its key things. Nebula is solving a different problem there, but

299
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,780
I've never really had any issues with the performance.

300
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:04,020
Yeah. And performance is one of those tricky things, right? What's good enough for one

301
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:09,340
use case or one person or one company won't be in others. Now, Slack for their part, I

302
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,500
mean, they were using this for pretty much all the back end communication between their

303
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,860
hosts, you know, web apps pulling from databases, things like that. And, you know, Chris, you

304
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:20,920
mentioned the orange ones right up. He's got some tips in there, too. It sounds like Slack

305
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,800
is seeing pretty good performance, but you may need to do some tuning to make sure Nebula

306
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,800
works for you.

307
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,420
Okay, so with all of that out of the way, Brent, he does have some ways that he uses

308
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:32,020
it that he wanted to let us know about.

309
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:38,060
He continues. All of the VPSs I have deployed have Nebula on them. I have all of my traffic

310
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:43,460
for salt running over Nebula. All of my VPSs and other servers and even workstations all

311
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:48,340
have salt minions running on them. I tell them to connect to the salt master via its

312
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:54,400
Nebula IP. All of his Synology NAS devices run Nebula on them. Well, I'm not using this

313
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,840
for data replication purposes yet. That will probably be a future use case just to provide

314
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,220
an additional location to have backup data.

315
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:06,180
I like that. I like using Nebula as a way to move backups around. And again, you can

316
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:10,260
see how the groups and the firewall features could make it so that perhaps maybe some systems

317
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:14,300
you can send to and they can't necessarily send to you. There could be some security

318
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,300
there.

319
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,300
Exactly.

320
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,300
He also included a few tips for us.

321
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:22,780
Yeah, he writes, use more than one lighthouse for Nebula. I use three lighthouses in three

322
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:27,440
different geographical locations with three different providers. At a minimum, I would

323
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,740
set up two lighthouses though, if only to make maintenance be non disruptive. And number

324
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:38,240
two, when you create your certificates, don't just choose a short name for a given machine.

325
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,240
For instance, choose something like hostname.nebula instead of just hostname. In this case, it

326
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:48,240
lets you take advantage of the DNS functionality that Nebula lighthouses can provide and avoids

327
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,680
conflict with things like dot local name resolution.

328
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,260
That might also come in handy if you choose to expand your network at some point. And

329
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,860
last thing you want is to run into those darn name collisions.

330
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:03,380
The third tip he has here, I think might be the most important one for our situation.

331
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:08,500
He writes, don't just rely on Nebula. I also use WireGuard where I can.

332
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:12,040
Boy, doesn't that ring true today? And you could say the reverse too. Don't just rely

333
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,500
on Nebula, have a WireGuard backup. Have both.

334
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,940
I mean, I think between WireGuard, Nebula, SSH, we've got to be covered, right?

335
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:24,580
I hope so. And RustDesk too. That's part of it as well. John the nice guy has been playing

336
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:28,860
around with Nebula. We'll have a link to a Raspberry Pi write up that he did with Nebula

337
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:33,460
using like a bash script. And it really kind of has me thinking about how we're going to

338
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:39,720
fix this when I get back. And I think in part what we should do, Wes, is we should remove

339
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,820
WireGuard from Fake NAS. So that way when Fake NAS is having a problem or whatever the

340
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:48,660
future NAS is going to be, because we're going to replace Fake NAS in the fall or maybe sooner,

341
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:53,780
we should have a separate device that is responsible for remote connectivity, like a Raspberry

342
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,940
Pi device.

343
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:59,300
Of course you would suggest a Raspberry Pi. But that particular out of the way. Yeah,

344
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:03,020
I definitely think you're right. You know, we don't need everything centralized on one

345
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:07,100
machine. I think we ended up in the situation just partly because, well, we had the machine

346
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:12,440
going, it was ready to go and it has good connectivity into the studio already. Plus,

347
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,380
that's kind of where we've been running most of our back end server workload containers

348
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:21,580
that do stuff at the studio. And we were playing with subspace and WireGuard. But as we've

349
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:26,060
talked about on recent shows, we don't really need all that connectivity. We're not, you

350
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:30,360
know, we are not hiring and firing new people who need access to the studio all the time.

351
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:35,300
So I think you're right. A simpler, redundant setup could get us a long way. Redundant.

352
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:39,980
Now that is, I think, going to be the key piece. So if anyone out there in the audience

353
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:46,820
has a way to do a hot pie failover for WireGuard and Nebula, let us know. I feel like that's

354
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:50,740
going to be particularly tricky because you're trying to get two devices that can respond

355
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:56,140
to a VPN connection request and we'd like to have two pies running simultaneously. And

356
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:01,980
if the primary one were offline for some reason, the secondary one would take over. I'm not

357
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,540
really sure how we would pull this off, but I'm going to start noodling that on the drive

358
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:10,740
around, you know, to Tucson and back home again. So if you've got any ideas, Linux unplugged

359
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:18,840
dot com slash contact and let me know who it is, a mess in here. Let me tell you now

360
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,180
that Brent's gone, nobody's doing the dishes. I cleaned up the fridge. That's true. That's

361
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:27,100
true. We did. You should actually be really impressed, Brent. We we really cleaned out

362
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,940
the fridge because we wanted to reduce weight on the slide. So it's like a bare bones fridge.

363
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:34,940
But now stuff flies around more than we're going down the road. So you open the fridge

364
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:39,700
and stuff come shooting out. It's bad. It's bad. But that's we'll clean about looking

365
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,180
that up another time. What I wanted to let you know about in the housekeeping is Gardner

366
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:48,100
Bryant has released a video of his time at System 76, and it's a little taste of what

367
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:52,900
we saw. So we're going to put a link to that in the show notes. Also, Leno did an interview

368
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:57,180
with me. We'll put a link to that in the show notes. We talked about Jupiter broadcasting.

369
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:00,780
We talked about going independent, hitting the one year mark and being in Denver. So

370
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:05,840
check that out. They were both pretty great. We'd also love to have you write in, give

371
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,200
us show ideas, feedback, all that kind of stuff at Linux unplugged dot com slash contact.

372
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,840
And if you like a more real time, ongoing conversation, Jupiter broadcasting dot com

373
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:20,140
slash telegram, get our telegram group. And then there's the like really high touch.

374
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:24,860
That's the mumble room. Not only does it run during our show, but it's every single Sunday

375
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:28,660
they're going in there with the virtual lug, having themselves a Linux beat up that you

376
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:33,300
can attend. And I know it seems like, oh, it's Sunday, noon, Pacific. What am I going

377
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:39,580
to get stuff to do? Trust me, we are social creatures. Even those of us who are introverts,

378
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:43,180
this stuff is actually really good for us. So go get the mumble info Linux unplugged

379
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:48,140
dot com slash mumble and go hang out with some like minded Linux geeks. And then last

380
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:52,460
but not least, we do have show art stickers up at Jupiter garage dot com. Now, if you'd

381
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:56,980
like to get a sticker for a device or a laptop, you know, I don't know what you got. Maybe

382
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:01,580
you want to put it on a sword. Maybe you're a ninja. I don't know. But I got stickers

383
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:07,540
for you at Jupiter garage dot com in various sizes.

384
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:11,140
Well now that it looks a little more ship shape in here, I think we've got time for

385
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:16,500
a pick. It's been a minute, though. That's why we've got something special this week.

386
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:24,020
Enter a fast Spotify client with a native GUI, no electron involved. And yes, Chris,

387
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:33,860
it's built in rust.

388
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:39,780
This is good to see. Get rid of that electron. Get it out of here. I know we harp on electron

389
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:43,820
a lot and it's become cliche, but I just want to make this point that while I have been

390
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:50,540
in this cellular vortex of hell, waiting for electron apps to load their UI components

391
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:57,020
when they check in with the server and stuff has been miserable. Electron is worse on a

392
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:00,740
slow Internet connection. So not only do I have all the bloat on my machine, but then

393
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:04,380
I have like this Web app that's like connecting to a remote server and getting elements that

394
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:10,980
just take forever to load. So looks great. A multiplatform Spotify client written in

395
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:17,800
rust. No electron. Heck, yes. It's got limited Linux testing so far. So go give it a try

396
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,660
and let the developer know how it's working. We'll have a link in the show notes for that.

397
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:29,660
Hey, guys, what's the name of the app again? Psst. That's P SST for you listeners out there.

398
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:33,860
Right. It's always easy just to go to Linux unplugged dot com slash four to one. I want

399
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:37,380
to say thank you to a cloud guru. You can find them on social media pretty much anywhere

400
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:41,680
that's a social media site. Just go to slash a cloud guru like the Twitters or the YouTubes

401
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,400
just slash the cloud guru. It's real easy. If you do that Twitter thing, you can follow

402
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:49,500
this here show at Linux unplugged. I'm over there at Chris Elias. What about you, Brent?

403
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:55,820
Are you on the Twitter? I am. That's at Brent Gervais, Wes. And I'm at Wes Payne. Who knew?

404
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:59,540
You guys should have said something. I would have been following you ages ago. The whole

405
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:02,980
networks over there to add Jupiter signal. That's great for news announcements and stuff

406
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:06,900
like this. I have no idea where I'm going to be next week, but we're going to do it

407
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:13,460
live Tuesday at noon Pacific three p.m. Eastern. See you next week. Same bad time. Same bad

408
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:17,980
station. Ah, yes. And if you work in the tech industry or you aspire to work in the tech

00:30:51,460 --> 00:31:17,980
you back here next Tuesday.

417
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:38,340
Oh, it just started raining. Oh, really? We just missed the store. Wow. Nicely done,

418
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:41,460
guys. Sorry, there's there will be a little bit of rain noise in the post show, but talk

419
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:47,380
about just hitting the window. We did it. You guys with our podcasting powers combined.

420
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:53,980
It's almost like we're experts. Yeah. Wow. We literally started recording the instant

421
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:59,060
it stopped raining and we finished the instant it started again. And that's good because

422
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:02,900
it's going to be raining for a few hours now. I actually kind of like the sound. It's very

423
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:08,340
soothing under your voice. If it was just me, we could just you could just listen. But

424
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:13,380
because it's the three of us when I'm not talking, my my track is cut. And so it just

425
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:17,620
comes and goes. It's really weird. If only I had a rainmaker in my recording booth.
