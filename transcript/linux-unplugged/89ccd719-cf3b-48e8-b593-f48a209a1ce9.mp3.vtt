00:00.000 --> 00:05.520
Feel like pre-show should be Brent's department, you know, yeah, he is good at scouring strange and interesting things

00:05.960 --> 00:08.480
Brent anything in the pre-show department this week. Well

00:09.480 --> 00:13.760
Pre-shows give me sex. I think here I got a mouthful of trail mix. Check your folder

00:14.320 --> 00:19.920
Open up your pre-show folder. I know you have a manila folder over there, right? I say that right West manila. Mm-hmm

00:20.240 --> 00:26.680
Okay, thank you. It's actually vanilla manila. Well, he's got you've got the scented ones. Yeah, you just got the scratch and sniff envelopes

00:26.680 --> 00:30.680
I know that

00:36.880 --> 00:41.600
Hello friends and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show. My name is Chris. My name is Wes

00:42.120 --> 00:43.560
Hello West

00:43.560 --> 00:50.240
374 is brought to you by the all-new a cloud guru the leader in learning for cloud Linux and other modern tech skills

00:50.400 --> 00:55.880
Hundreds of courses thousands of hands-on labs get certified get hired get learning a cloud guru comm

00:55.880 --> 00:57.880
West today on the show

00:57.880 --> 01:04.600
It's one of those where we adventure out into the server garage and we attempt to do something that we probably should have taken a few

01:04.600 --> 01:06.600
More precautions before we even got started

01:07.320 --> 01:09.320
That's for sure. I

01:10.340 --> 01:13.760
Mean it was a while ago on the show a few weeks back

01:13.760 --> 01:18.280
We have updated people on our setup with next cloud. It was a question that came into the show

01:18.800 --> 01:20.440
362 of this podcast

01:20.440 --> 01:21.760
So it's been a little bit

01:21.760 --> 01:27.400
we reveal how much we were spending per month and I think people were shocked and so we set out on a mission to

01:27.400 --> 01:29.400
tighten that up by quite a bit and

01:29.840 --> 01:38.120
Update reconfigure and maybe come up with a damn near most perfect next cloud setup. I've ever seen that is fairly bulletproof

01:38.160 --> 01:40.160
it's portable and

01:40.720 --> 01:42.240
Something we're gonna recommend in a little bit

01:42.240 --> 01:47.680
But we have a lot to do before we get there including some community news that I'm very excited about

01:47.680 --> 01:54.160
So to help us analyze all of this it is our team of experts time-appropriate greeting virtual log

01:58.040 --> 02:04.280
Was a good one, hey, you know 22 strong this week we've had more but I think maybe one of the better intros there

02:04.280 --> 02:07.020
So hello everybody. Thanks for being here with us today

02:07.120 --> 02:12.640
Why don't we start with a little KTE news because it's been a while since we've talked about the plasma desktop too long

02:12.640 --> 02:19.380
The excellent plasma desktop and KD developers for more than a year have been working to evolve the default breeze theme

02:19.720 --> 02:26.440
Which that work is being done by the KD visual design group and it's finally paying off with an initial breeze

02:27.000 --> 02:34.500
Evolution breeze evolution is a modest refresh to the UI so far various subtle changes have landed around window shadows

02:34.720 --> 02:37.080
sidebars and color alterations

02:37.080 --> 02:43.680
More work on breeze evolution will continue leading up to its debut in KD plasma 5.21

02:43.680 --> 02:48.760
Oh, I look forward to that also happening is some work on K wins Wayland virtual keyboard

02:48.760 --> 02:54.640
Which now you're ready for this supports GTK applications that you didn't think that's what I was gonna say. Oh

02:55.200 --> 02:59.220
That's neat. Yeah, we'll have a link to the blog post by

02:59.680 --> 03:04.040
Nate who we've had on the show before that covers this and a bunch of other really cool stuff

03:04.040 --> 03:09.080
Coming to the next update in KTE. It's such a nice solid performer these days

03:09.080 --> 03:13.000
and I think we have slipped into a mistake of not talking about it very much and

03:13.360 --> 03:20.400
So we wanted to write that wrong with kind of some really thought-provoking KTE discussion that came out of Academy 2020

03:20.400 --> 03:23.120
Oh, yes at that annual KTE conference

03:23.120 --> 03:29.980
Of course held virtually this year KD developer and the head Graham delivered a talk entitled visions of the future

03:29.980 --> 03:34.380
About the possible future of KTE on commercial products

03:35.540 --> 03:38.060
subtitled plasma sold on retail hardware

03:38.580 --> 03:45.940
Lots of it the session concentrated on ways to make KTE applications and also the plasma desktop the default

03:46.180 --> 03:49.260
environment on hardware sold to the general public

03:49.900 --> 03:56.260
the proposal includes creating an official KD distribution with a hardware certification program and

03:56.260 --> 04:03.140
Directly paying developers. Yeah, there's also another bombshell in here and I got some audio from the event

04:03.140 --> 04:07.260
But we'll also link to the entire YouTube video Graham started by giving some context

04:07.260 --> 04:12.620
the ideas that were to be presented was a follow-up on the entire KD accessibility and

04:13.140 --> 04:19.540
Productivity goals that we talked to him about in 2017 and one of the objectives was to get plasma and KTE

04:19.940 --> 04:23.140
applications ready to work on all kinds of hardware

04:23.140 --> 04:30.420
well Graham thinks that this has been achieved and now it's time to move to the next step for KTE and that is

04:31.380 --> 04:33.380
creating an official KTE

04:33.780 --> 04:40.060
Operating system. I think what that next thing is is to create an official KTE OS

04:40.780 --> 04:43.100
So you might ask why would we want to do this?

04:43.900 --> 04:49.820
Well, the simplest reason is we have to if we want a direct relationship with hardware vendors

04:49.820 --> 04:57.020
Because that's what they need they need an OS and that means working with distro partners or it means having our own OS and we

04:57.020 --> 05:04.700
Love our distro partners. I do too, but having our own OS allows us to have our own relationship with them

05:04.700 --> 05:08.500
And thankfully we already have one that OS is neon

05:09.300 --> 05:12.660
Unfortunately neon is is a bit of a halfway product

05:12.660 --> 05:19.780
It's mostly designed to showcase KTE software non KTE software can be very outdated and does not necessarily

05:19.780 --> 05:24.580
Guarantee to work. It has a very small development team and most puzzlingly

05:24.580 --> 05:28.900
We don't admit that KTE neon is an OS in our own messaging

05:29.860 --> 05:36.900
On the other hand KTE neon is indeed enough of an OS that the slim book people ship it on their hardware and

05:36.900 --> 05:43.700
Lots and lots of people use it as their daily driver on their own computers, including my wife. She loves it. It's really great

05:44.020 --> 05:50.420
So I think it's time for us to finally admit that neon is a real OS and treat it as such

05:50.820 --> 05:57.300
We can say that it's what we believe the reference implementation of KTE software ought to look like and promote it accordingly

05:57.300 --> 06:02.980
You know just clean up our messaging a little bit many make this sounds similar to an initiative by the gnome folks

06:02.980 --> 06:05.780
Doesn't it? Yeah, it's a little bit different

06:05.780 --> 06:12.100
Yeah, indeed. It does. I mean it was years ago that gnome developers wanted to create a gnome OS

06:12.580 --> 06:14.740
because they thought that they would be just

06:15.860 --> 06:21.460
Good to have it its own OS but never appeared. Well, they're still kind of working on it

06:21.700 --> 06:24.100
I heard them talking about it at this year's Gwadek

06:24.340 --> 06:30.980
So it may still be coming there are isos out there. This does make me think sometimes when we talk about this, you know, we

06:30.980 --> 06:36.020
Lament default settings at least occasionally and historically in some of these big desktop environments

06:36.020 --> 06:42.740
And I wonder if some more of this vertical integration actually more, you know more fully shipping something that's considered an OS

06:42.980 --> 06:50.020
I wonder if that will have any impact, you know, I'm sitting here right now reading this news off of a machine running KDE neon

06:50.820 --> 06:57.220
I mean west you have even the foggiest guess of how old this install is older than 2018. Maybe 2017. No

06:57.220 --> 07:05.460
No, it's getting close to three years. I'd say at least it's a pretty solid desktop as a pretty happy KDE neon user

07:05.860 --> 07:07.860
I kind of wondered well

07:07.860 --> 07:12.900
What would a more official KDE neon look like and nate has thoughts on that as well

07:13.220 --> 07:16.740
First of all, it would have the latest kernels in it for hardware enablement purposes

07:17.220 --> 07:22.500
It would probably have a method to have newer kernels in it than even its parent OS Ubuntu does

07:23.060 --> 07:25.620
It would have more up-to-date third-party apps

07:25.620 --> 07:30.500
If not from the repos then maybe from flat pack or snap or one of these

07:30.900 --> 07:32.900
Generally new generation

07:33.540 --> 07:35.220
app

07:35.220 --> 07:39.140
Deployment mechanisms that we support it would have a lot more development resources, too

07:39.380 --> 07:43.780
And this is sort of a call to action here. I think if you want to make this happen

07:44.260 --> 07:46.260
Please please go ahead and help out

07:46.820 --> 07:53.380
There's also the possibility that in case neon's Ubuntu base ever proves unsuitable for some reason

07:53.380 --> 07:58.820
It could be rebased on another OS. I I think we can be fairly agnostic about that

07:59.060 --> 08:04.660
And generally our new neon based KDE OS would just be more awesome in every way

08:04.820 --> 08:09.220
That's that's what I think is the most important thing about it. I don't know about that new base OS

08:09.300 --> 08:12.260
I really appreciate that. It's based on Ubuntu actually

08:14.020 --> 08:16.020
I think Nate's a big OpenSUSE Leap fan

08:16.420 --> 08:19.140
So I understand, but I I think that'd be

08:19.140 --> 08:26.180
Really something if the project started being just a little more upfront. Yeah, this is actually the official OS

08:26.260 --> 08:30.900
and this is what our developers are using and targeting and this is what we're working with hardware providers and

08:31.380 --> 08:34.820
Nate also talked about a hardware certification program that would sort of go

08:35.380 --> 08:42.980
Along with this and so there's several official goals. I think that they would foresee with an actual KDE OS

08:43.460 --> 08:47.460
I think the end result of this would be pretty beneficial for us because

08:47.460 --> 08:53.220
Because we would be able to work directly with hardware vendors in in a better way

08:53.780 --> 08:55.940
Having neon has already allowed us to do this

08:56.420 --> 09:03.140
And I think it's important that we continue to improve that offering so that we can improve our ability to work with hardware vendors

09:03.620 --> 09:06.820
And I think there's also a very good chance as I mentioned earlier that

09:07.540 --> 09:14.180
Making neon our own official reference implementation of KDE software would encourage other KDE

09:14.180 --> 09:17.400
Distros to to up their game do a better job

09:18.760 --> 09:21.640
Not to say that they do a bad job. Obviously I use a non

09:22.520 --> 09:26.440
Neon distro and I think they do a great job, but there's always room for improvement everywhere

09:26.520 --> 09:28.760
Right, and I think this is an example where competition

09:29.400 --> 09:35.480
Potential to help everybody there is one concern I'd have about this and I'd be interested to know

09:36.280 --> 09:39.800
What some of the developers using neon and creating neon think about this

09:39.800 --> 09:45.240
Is it seems like it would take away this development playground where they can try things out

09:45.880 --> 09:47.880
If it needs to all of a sudden be a quote-unquote

09:48.680 --> 09:50.680
reference implementation

09:50.920 --> 09:53.800
Then the burden of getting it right

09:54.600 --> 09:58.600
And having it polished is a bit higher, isn't it? Yeah, right

09:58.600 --> 10:03.000
I mean I think right now as we use KDE neon we kind of have a caveat of like well

10:03.400 --> 10:05.400
You know, we don't really we shouldn't really treat it like it's stable

10:05.400 --> 10:07.720
You probably shouldn't use it unless you're willing to have your desktop

10:07.720 --> 10:09.960
Maybe possibly break and in practice

10:10.040 --> 10:15.000
I don't think that's really happened or if it does happen it updates so frequently that the next day, you know

10:15.000 --> 10:17.640
You've got an update fixing whatever small regression happened

10:18.520 --> 10:21.240
but they probably still need a playground right like some sort of

10:21.640 --> 10:27.720
A new area testing branch of if KDE neon itself becomes something more like stable

10:27.960 --> 10:31.800
I have a question for a couple of you in the mumble room. Maybe I'll start with Brent and Carl

10:32.200 --> 10:34.040
What are your thoughts on?

10:34.040 --> 10:38.280
Almost more fragmentation in the Linux landscape if we start seeing different

10:39.240 --> 10:44.760
Distros spin up into their quote-unquote own operating systems for hardware deals. Are you concerned at all about?

10:45.480 --> 10:50.360
More distros more fragmentation more islands. That's a question that comes up often, isn't it?

10:50.440 --> 10:55.160
And I I wonder if our energy like in developers will get spread out

10:55.400 --> 10:57.080
It feels like we're a little thin already

10:57.080 --> 11:02.120
So if we start going into all our own little projects around every single little technology

11:02.120 --> 11:04.680
Is that going to cause some problems but maybe?

11:05.560 --> 11:08.860
On the flip side, maybe it's a good thing. Maybe it means that hardware manufacturers

11:09.560 --> 11:12.760
There's a lot more opportunity there than there was even a year or two ago

11:13.160 --> 11:18.040
So maybe it's a maybe it's a good sign very true. It could be I really don't have a problem with it

11:18.120 --> 11:19.480
I mean the way I look at it

11:19.480 --> 11:23.480
It's people's free time and they can spend it how they want to and you know for a lot of them

11:23.480 --> 11:24.440
It's their creative outlet

11:24.440 --> 11:28.600
They're going to have opinions about the way they want to do things and I have no problem with that whatsoever

11:28.600 --> 11:34.200
And at least for the moment, right? They are still based on the ubuntu base. So if anything maybe that just adds some

11:34.840 --> 11:40.440
Draws some folks might use a different kde based distro over to the ubuntu world and you know more testers there

11:40.840 --> 11:43.160
Mm-hmm. And if you think about it at that level

11:43.720 --> 11:48.600
Well, then really it's getting pretty standardized stuff here. You have an ubuntu base. It's using system d

11:48.760 --> 11:52.600
it uses a kernel of a certain version that has these certain features and

11:53.480 --> 11:57.020
You start to realize it's not really all of that fragmented

11:57.020 --> 12:01.500
I mean at that layer at that level things are actually becoming more and more consistent

12:02.140 --> 12:04.140
Despite what some people would prefer

12:04.540 --> 12:06.860
I'm going to keep listening for this haven't heard much from the

12:07.500 --> 12:12.140
Kde neon folks, but would love to know their thoughts on this if this is something they'd be interested in pursuing and then

12:12.780 --> 12:14.220
if it is

12:14.220 --> 12:18.540
How do we as a community step up and support it and make it happen because i'd love to

12:19.100 --> 12:22.700
To know that this kde neon install that I have here is the official

12:22.700 --> 12:27.980
Kde plasma os and that it's going to be supported and around for a long time

12:28.300 --> 12:30.700
That just kind of as an end user gives me a little more reassurance

12:31.420 --> 12:36.300
I'm, not convinced. That's who neon is designed for right now, but uh, maybe that's the transition they can make

12:36.620 --> 12:38.620
Maybe they're willing to take that transition

12:40.380 --> 12:42.460
Linode.com slash unplugged get a

12:49.500 --> 12:56.140
They're the largest independent cloud provider full stop and they make it easy for anyone at any skill level to get started

12:56.300 --> 13:00.060
No matter what technology stack you use linode can help your ideas come to life

13:00.220 --> 13:03.680
If you just need a personal web server for a blog or a portfolio

13:04.380 --> 13:07.740
Or maybe your business needs to scale to serve millions

13:08.140 --> 13:13.100
Linode can help you with that and unlike entry-level hosting services that lock you into their platform

13:13.180 --> 13:17.900
Linode gives you full back-end access to customize and control your server to fit your needs

13:17.900 --> 13:22.540
They have a great dns manager simple to take backups one click app deployments

13:22.620 --> 13:26.460
And if kubernetes is your speed to manage your infrastructure linode has you covered there

13:26.460 --> 13:31.820
You can easily manage your kubernetes cluster with linode's fully managed container orchestration engine

13:32.140 --> 13:37.500
Also a great way to learn if you want to learn cyber security or practice something before you have to do it in production

13:37.820 --> 13:40.620
Linode has some great options there at great price points

13:40.700 --> 13:45.580
But one of the things that I encourage you to look into is their s3 compatible object storage

13:45.580 --> 13:51.740
If you're not familiar object storage is essentially an easy way for you to store and access data in the cloud

13:51.980 --> 13:56.940
Without having to run a front-end file server. It's perfect for data. That doesn't change regularly

13:56.940 --> 14:01.100
This is where we use it all the time for show assets that are essentially static

14:01.420 --> 14:04.460
And what something is up in their s3 compatible object storage

14:04.540 --> 14:11.100
It's really easy to get a url and share that file if you want or maybe even use something like that to power a static website

14:11.100 --> 14:18.780
We use linode's powerful virtual servers to run our infrastructure our matrix server our encoding server our new next cloud server

14:18.860 --> 14:22.220
All of it's on linode. My personal servers are on linode

14:22.460 --> 14:30.860
Linode started in 2003 as one of the first companies to even get into what is now known as cloud computing three years before aws

14:31.260 --> 14:38.220

So let's talk a little more hardware this got me thinking this week nvidia unveiled a raspberry pi competitor

14:59.180 --> 15:05.260
We've got hardware on the brain. And so I kind of wanted to just chat about this with you guys and just in time

15:05.260 --> 15:11.900
A wild. Mr. Drew has snuck into the studio. Hello, drew. Hello, chris. Good to have you here

15:12.380 --> 15:18.060
You know the state of disarray that our hardware is slowly devolving into here in the studio

15:18.460 --> 15:23.020
It's all reached like the five year mark or something like that since we built it or maybe four year

15:23.100 --> 15:26.300
I'm, not sure it runs 24 seven. So in computer years, it's a lot

15:26.940 --> 15:28.620
and

15:28.620 --> 15:32.780
Wes and I spent some time this weekend racking our brains on

15:32.780 --> 15:34.940
on how to really kind of

15:35.660 --> 15:37.660
attack this problem and

15:37.900 --> 15:44.220
Figure out like should we should we build it differently? Should we say break the system up into six or seven individual components?

15:45.020 --> 15:48.940
Or should we consolidate it down into one really super powerful rig?

15:49.500 --> 15:54.540
I mean we've kicked around all the different scenarios and listener of the show mike f has sent us some hardware recently

15:54.940 --> 16:01.020
Which is still coming. It's still inbound west. There's still more. Oh boy. Yeah, and one of the things he sent us

16:01.020 --> 16:04.460
Is a batch like a lot

16:05.340 --> 16:07.340
of pine 64

16:07.420 --> 16:09.100
one gigabyte

16:09.100 --> 16:13.420
Small boards, you know ones that are closer to the raspberry pi. They have the gpio ports

16:13.900 --> 16:16.300
um, I don't think it's the rock pro 64, but it's

16:17.340 --> 16:22.060
It's still a it's still a little pine board and we're not really even sure what we're going to do with all of them

16:22.540 --> 16:24.700
You know, what do you do with like seven boards like that?

16:24.780 --> 16:26.140
And so then I so I started thinking well

16:26.140 --> 16:31.820
Maybe like we could use them as sensors, you know, like a temperature sensor out in the server room to check check in on that

16:32.380 --> 16:37.820
So anyways, like it's we're in this weird hardware phase right now where we need to replace our recording machine

16:38.540 --> 16:41.100
which currently runs, uh zubuntu

16:42.620 --> 16:50.220
It might have actually been kubuntu converted to zubuntu for some reason and that runs reaper which records individual tracks for everyone in mumble and

16:50.700 --> 16:53.500
For myself and wes and drew and then it also

16:53.500 --> 16:56.540
So routes the audio out to remote people and remote guests

16:57.180 --> 17:00.540
And then the other machine that's kind of falling apart on us is the obs machine

17:00.940 --> 17:05.980
Which does the live stream and records any videos if we record video versions and captures all of that and puts it out?

17:06.300 --> 17:10.940
and also makes our backup recording both of these machines are just completely falling apart and

17:11.660 --> 17:15.180
I don't think these arm boards are where we need them yet

17:15.740 --> 17:18.780
But it has started to enter our mind that maybe in the future

17:18.780 --> 17:24.940
We're going to start replacing these x86 systems with these low power arm systems that could be freaking mounted to the table

17:25.980 --> 17:33.520
Just put them up under the table right small lower power maybe fanless and if they're cheap easily replaceable sort of standardizable

17:33.980 --> 17:35.980
So nvidia comes along

17:36.060 --> 17:39.180
With their lowest priced arm small board computer to date

17:39.740 --> 17:43.660
They're really kind of focusing this at the developer market robotics market. It's

17:43.660 --> 17:50.060
For small tasks that need pretty high-end cpu and gpu for what you get in this form factor

17:50.300 --> 17:57.260
It's called the jetson nano and it's already pretty cheap, but today they're introducing a $60 version

17:57.260 --> 18:01.740
So their standard jetson nano was a hundred dollars, but now they're introducing a $60 version

18:02.300 --> 18:08.860
That looks like it's priced pretty nice for what you actually get in something this size. Well, yeah, right? I mean it's $59

18:08.860 --> 18:13.740
The usd and it's quite similar to the $99 full full board

18:13.820 --> 18:17.340
But with just two gigs of system memory rather than four

18:18.060 --> 18:21.580
So it's kind of in direct competition with the higher end raspberry pi models

18:21.900 --> 18:25.580
But it has a more powerful tegra gpu and nvidia's extensive

18:26.060 --> 18:29.420
gpu optimized software solutions if you're into that

18:29.740 --> 18:37.100
Well, there's a lot of people that are basing their software around it and $60 gets you four cortex a57 cores at 1.43 gigahertz

18:37.100 --> 18:40.140
like west said two gigs of ram you had micro sd

18:41.020 --> 18:45.180
And there's 128 core maxwell gpu on this thing that has nvec

18:45.340 --> 18:47.740
Which is their nvidia encoding and cuda capabilities?

18:47.900 --> 18:53.900
It also has so you can get the data in and out of there pretty fast gigabit ethernet hdmi output and three

18:54.860 --> 18:58.220
Usb 3.0 ports. Oh, isn't that fancy?

18:59.260 --> 19:04.060
Now the arm cores on the raspberry pi 4 should probably perform a little bit better

19:04.060 --> 19:09.900
But the jetson nano 2 gig has the much more capable gpu and I think you kind of hit on it there with the cuda

19:09.960 --> 19:11.020
support

19:11.020 --> 19:15.420
Sort of more similar to a board that you might run on a standard x86 environment

19:15.500 --> 19:17.020
So if you just need to do this, maybe in the field

19:17.020 --> 19:20.780
You've already got stuff optimized for the nvidia stack and you just want to run the same stack

19:21.100 --> 19:25.260
But in a smaller lower power form factor, maybe this looks pretty interesting

19:25.260 --> 19:32.860
Um, I can't help but feel the elephant in the room is apple has an arm announcement next week as we record this

19:34.220 --> 19:35.580
on tuesday

19:35.580 --> 19:39.580
Uh, we've been kicking around the whole arm development angle on coda radio, which by the way everybody

19:40.300 --> 19:42.300
Coda radio is back. If you didn't know

19:44.140 --> 19:45.900
Coda radio program

19:45.900 --> 19:49.340
Coder dot show. Is it just me or is there a new one dropping today?

19:49.580 --> 19:53.580
I think there's a new one dropping probably as we speak. So check it out coder dot show

19:53.580 --> 19:57.820
It's back the last few episodes. I've managed to really piss off the seuss lizards

19:58.140 --> 20:02.220
So I could use I could use a backup there if you want to catch up on the last couple of episodes

20:02.300 --> 20:04.620
I'd love to hear your thoughts. But also we've been kicking around

20:05.340 --> 20:10.540
arm as a development target and uh, all of this kind of plays into that and

20:11.340 --> 20:18.700
I don't know wes. I feel like um, there is a change in the winds winter is coming potentially for a desktop linux

20:18.700 --> 20:21.020
But oh you sweet summer child

20:21.020 --> 20:26.140
I talk about it more in coda radius. Check it out. The coda radio program is back

20:26.940 --> 20:28.300
and

20:28.300 --> 20:29.560
it's

20:29.560 --> 20:31.560
glorious business

20:31.980 --> 20:32.940
All right

20:32.940 --> 20:38.160
You know wes, um before we get into the next cloud stuff. What do you say? We just do a little spot of housekeeping

20:40.060 --> 20:42.860
Yeah, let's do it it's high time in here it's kind of dusty

20:43.340 --> 20:45.740
I know and you know something we should have been mentioning for a long time

20:45.820 --> 20:49.340
But the jupiter broadcasting all shows feed is probably the way to go

20:49.340 --> 20:55.260
Now if you look at it, we've kind of honed in on what jb covers and like coda radio, for example, you'd know it's back

20:55.820 --> 20:58.620
It's in the all shows feed and there are things in the works

20:58.700 --> 21:03.660
You don't want to miss anything new the all shows feed. You can just search for all jupiter broadcasting shows

21:04.540 --> 21:11.740
In your podcast client or there is a link. Why waste all that time subscribing individually when it's a one stop shop also

21:12.460 --> 21:15.100
Now that jupiter broadcasting is independent again

21:15.100 --> 21:21.500
We are looking for some sponsors if you're looking to reach the perfect audience, you know, if you're out there, you know

21:21.500 --> 21:26.620
This is a great audience to reach the best audience in podcasting and we have some opportunities

21:26.700 --> 21:30.060
So email me chris at jupiter broadcasting dot com

21:30.780 --> 21:35.100
And you may notice here on the old linux unplugged show. We try to keep the politics out

21:35.180 --> 21:39.260
This is a technology area, but it is political season in the states

21:39.500 --> 21:42.780
So it's never been a better time to check out unfilter unfilter dot show

21:42.780 --> 21:45.580
It's not part of jupiter broadcasting so we don't talk about it here

21:45.980 --> 21:49.660
But it is up and cranking to cover the people's history in real time

21:50.140 --> 21:55.660
I'm doing live streams for each of the debates. They start 30 minutes before the debates and of course, we'll do a live stream

21:56.460 --> 21:58.460
for the election night itself

21:58.540 --> 22:05.420
All of that unfilter dot show check it out. It's back weekly and um, I think better than eva

22:05.900 --> 22:09.980
Thanks, everybody who also has already joined over there and been hanging out with me in the discord

22:09.980 --> 22:12.860
That was a lot of fun. We did the last debate. We're gonna do it again

22:13.260 --> 22:17.100
And that's one of the nice things I like the setup. I just decided jb, you know

22:17.180 --> 22:20.540
It's gonna it's got its focus and we're not gonna bring all of that stuff into it

22:20.540 --> 22:22.540
So we don't that way we don't have to talk about it in the shows

22:22.620 --> 22:28.780
We have a spot for it all the politics all of the world news all of that unfilter dot show go check it out

22:31.260 --> 22:36.300
Okay, so we we had a bit of a next cloud conundrum pretty quickly

22:36.300 --> 22:42.220
Our monthly storage bill was getting close to four hundred dollars a month and it's a pretty essential tool

22:42.540 --> 22:46.620
It's how we pass around all of our raw recordings how we pass around our finished recordings

22:46.620 --> 22:54.060
It's where we store our assets for things like well things like jingles like that housekeeping jingle. They're all stored in next cloud

22:54.300 --> 22:56.540
Yeah, it's really integrated into the workflow at this point

22:56.860 --> 23:04.460
And one of the things that we did when we built our last next cloud setup is we decided to base the backend storage on

23:04.460 --> 23:06.460
object storage

23:06.480 --> 23:14.640
Which allowed us to grow at infinitum, which we were intentionally doing that's how we got to like 400 gigs

23:15.080 --> 23:21.440
Yeah, and we wanted something where we could just keep working and load it up

23:21.440 --> 23:25.680
And then we could come back and clean it up and we knew that would be a job we'd have to do

23:26.240 --> 23:31.400
But what was more important is that the daily productions wouldn't get held up by running out of storage

23:31.400 --> 23:34.760
Which is where we'd always run into trouble with our previous

23:35.240 --> 23:41.080
next cloud and own cloud implementations is eventually we'd run out of storage because we're constantly passing around

23:41.560 --> 23:46.520
80 megabyte 100 megabyte files even larger when they're waves and video clips

23:46.760 --> 23:50.920
so we needed something that wouldn't eat itself storage wise and

23:51.400 --> 23:54.280
we knew at some point we'd have to come back and clean things up and

23:55.560 --> 23:59.640
That is now we wanted to re-architect how we do next cloud

23:59.640 --> 24:06.280
And what we've gone with if you'll allow the term here. I apologize ahead of time a hybrid cloud setup

24:06.280 --> 24:11.840
I know I'm using the buzz terms. How dare you? I'm sorry Wes, but it's true

24:11.840 --> 24:15.920
We've gone with the on-premises and in the cloud setup

24:15.920 --> 24:21.900
And we've kind of arranged things in a way that we think is gonna work really good long term and keep the overall

24:22.520 --> 24:24.760
monthly cost down and so that meant

24:24.760 --> 24:30.840
Getting a space set up here on our local file server that runs arch that you guys will hear us talk about very often

24:30.840 --> 24:33.320
It also has a next cloud instance on there

24:33.480 --> 24:38.920
But there was a little bit of maintenance we had to do to get it to that point it

24:39.000 --> 24:41.600
You know, it needed a little love just a bit

24:41.600 --> 24:47.760
Yeah, and so good guy Wes came up on Sunday this last weekend

24:48.440 --> 24:53.840
After I finished recording Linux action news Wes showed up and we had some killer food

24:53.840 --> 24:57.780
Really good. I don't think I complimented you enough on the pork. It was

24:58.600 --> 25:00.280
tremendous and

25:00.280 --> 25:05.000
My wife got us some size and she got us some barbecued chicken and we sat down and we had one of those work and eat

25:05.000 --> 25:10.200
Days, I mean, I think we did it in the wrong order and that we feasted first and then tried to get to work

25:10.200 --> 25:12.960
But I mean we got to stuff done. We were a little sleepy

25:13.120 --> 25:14.960
We had a little bit of food coma

25:14.960 --> 25:19.240
But we had to we had to get the base server here in the studio ready

25:19.240 --> 25:25.120
We had to prep it if you will so job one was take care of the base arch install before we loaded it up with

25:25.120 --> 25:30.440
A bunch of data. So we set off into the Jupiter broadcasting high-security server garage

25:30.920 --> 25:32.960
Okay job one is we got to prep this thing

25:33.000 --> 25:39.040
So we got to do all of our due diligence make sure the OS is up to date. Uh-oh. So do that cuz it's been

25:41.040 --> 25:43.040
Month or two

25:43.040 --> 25:48.640
Do you just Pac-man so that way it's not all that you are too. I thought we might start there

25:48.640 --> 25:50.640
So we are see what we're working against

25:51.400 --> 25:53.400
Yeah, should we replace this?

25:54.020 --> 25:56.120
Package name with some other package name. Yes

25:56.840 --> 25:59.560
Core something with something core other something. Oh

26:00.800 --> 26:04.760
Yeah, you tell Linux libs. That's probably not important. All right

26:06.320 --> 26:09.640
New kernel new Linux LTS kernel coming in excellent

26:09.640 --> 26:15.080
So we will also have to upgrade a new wire guy. Yep. New Zia new system D

26:15.080 --> 26:18.080
There's probably gonna be a ZFS update in there to new Samba

26:19.880 --> 26:23.520
Big question is what about Docker? Cuz yep new doc new Docker as well

26:25.040 --> 26:29.160
Cuz this is just the base OS doesn't even get us the next club funny though

26:30.160 --> 26:36.440
547 megabyte download net upgrade size 45 megabytes. Got a little arch

26:36.440 --> 26:38.440
Shall it yeah, let's do it. I

26:38.560 --> 26:43.040
Give us a hard time for being reckless. But in a way we were actually taking a fairly

26:43.760 --> 26:50.560
Methodical approach here. We were first updating the base OS to make sure all of the host OS packages were up to date

26:51.200 --> 26:57.520
We were on the latest version of Docker and you'll recall part of our bulletproof arch setup is this thing snapshots

26:58.200 --> 27:03.920
Every time it does an upgrade and we're running now on the LTS kernel a change we made to the LTS

27:03.920 --> 27:08.960
We're running now on the LTS kernel a change we made not too long ago that already pay dividends

27:09.520 --> 27:13.480
This time around. Oh, yeah, and we wanted to just get all of that, right?

27:13.600 --> 27:15.760
so you got to do all of that and then it's

27:15.920 --> 27:21.480
Reboot time and you guys know how nerve-wracking this can be when you've done a big update and this one in particular

27:22.080 --> 27:27.160
this one took a really really long time to shut down and then it booted up and

27:28.480 --> 27:32.280
Somehow like the silent boot mode got turned back on or we never disabled it

27:32.280 --> 27:35.640
And so we just sat there staring at a screen for what felt like

27:36.400 --> 27:38.400
27 years

27:39.440 --> 27:41.600
Take your 70s over there we go

27:48.760 --> 27:55.680
I'm reminded that this is a pretty foolproof setup. We have with one major exception and that is

27:56.120 --> 27:59.840
The entire OS runs off this one ten thousand rpm hard drive

27:59.840 --> 28:04.480
So the data is all safe on a raid, but we have one OS drive

28:04.960 --> 28:10.120
Chris you do have to factor in that we've conveniently located the OS drive on the exterior of the case for easy

28:10.400 --> 28:12.400
Replacement in case that's necessary

28:13.480 --> 28:16.240
Welcome to grab West. It's good to be here. Yeah

28:17.440 --> 28:22.880
All right, sure turns off. Yeah, why are we going to power say oh, you know, this is one of my first LCD screens

28:22.880 --> 28:28.640
I ever bought this monitors probably about 17 years old. You gotta say it's a nice aspect ratio

28:28.640 --> 28:35.160
Yeah, it's the old aspect the old square aspect ratio. Yeah, it does make good for a console. It's kind of perfect. Yeah

28:36.720 --> 28:43.760
All right system D firing up I see drives lighting up that's a good sign means it's probably talking ZFS

28:44.760 --> 28:50.880
You're always watching for like all the signs, you know, okay drives are flashing. That's good. That's all the fans

28:50.880 --> 28:57.840
They change their sound. That's a good sign. Yeah, maybe the you know, the display resolution changes and yeah, that does happen

28:57.840 --> 29:01.040
You see the video driver load so it booted up. Eventually

29:01.040 --> 29:06.480
We got the login screen and the first job for then really with this is like job two of just bringing

29:06.720 --> 29:11.520
The arch server up to date now is make sure the ZFS pool mounted all our data is there

29:12.200 --> 29:17.640
No, it did take a long time to reboot last time. We did this. I mean at least I come online

29:17.640 --> 29:19.640
I could have to say Jim. Oh, hey

29:20.000 --> 29:22.680
There we go. So I think we just we should just switch that, you know

29:22.680 --> 29:26.840
We want to see the console scrolling by look at all the disk going well

29:26.840 --> 29:28.840
Yeah, I thought I thought we did have that on

29:29.600 --> 29:31.600
Let's log in and see if we have a sequel

29:43.440 --> 29:45.440
I everything's online

29:49.760 --> 29:51.760
And our containers

29:51.760 --> 29:55.560
May still be loading actually, I think they're still loading

29:57.160 --> 30:00.240
All right, we'll give it a minute we'll check back this next part

30:00.240 --> 30:02.880
I would have messed up Wes if you weren't here

30:02.880 --> 30:08.640
It was your idea that we should go kind of incrementally through the next cloud releases

30:08.640 --> 30:15.480
I would have just gone whole hog to the latest version. You just love updates. I do. I just would have gone for it, but

30:16.120 --> 30:19.200
You had a process you had a procedure and

30:19.200 --> 30:22.560
We were ready to now tackle next cloud and get it all up-to-date

30:22.560 --> 30:28.040
So that way we could have both the cloud version and our locally hosted version at the same exact version

30:28.360 --> 30:32.240
We turn our attention to next cloud, which is

30:32.760 --> 30:35.880
Version 17 dot something. It's a few releases behind

30:35.880 --> 30:40.160
We want to go hands-on with this update because we want to make sure that we get this right

30:40.160 --> 30:43.240
It appears we're gonna need to go in a bit of a stepped approach

30:43.240 --> 30:47.280
We're gonna step up to version 18 and then to 19

30:47.280 --> 30:49.920
18 and then to 19 or what has this work?

30:49.920 --> 30:53.600
Yeah, sounds like you should really only go one major version at a time

30:53.600 --> 31:00.120
At least I noticed some lines in the docs advising that I suggest we just go all the way to current but Wes wanted to be

31:00.120 --> 31:02.120
careful, I know

31:02.800 --> 31:03.600
So, okay

31:03.600 --> 31:09.320
So if I understand we're gonna go 17 and we're gonna update to a supportive version of 17 and then to the release version

31:09.320 --> 31:11.320
Whatever current version that is right now. Exactly

31:11.760 --> 31:12.800
Okay

31:12.800 --> 31:14.920
Let's give it a go. So first step is

31:14.920 --> 31:16.920
Docker compose pull

31:18.760 --> 31:20.200
You

31:20.200 --> 31:24.360
You have to pull a specific. Yeah, we want to update and make sure we're grabbing the right image here

31:24.800 --> 31:29.640
Okay, so how are you gonna make sure you pull the right version of this container since we're doing a pull?

31:29.680 --> 31:37.600
Well, they've got a list of supported versions up on their github a few other places in the documentation and that includes supported Docker image releases

31:37.600 --> 31:39.600
So we're just gonna use the tag for that version

31:39.600 --> 31:47.360
Which is really just a simple update the YAML file make sure you've specified the exact version of the image you want and

31:47.760 --> 31:51.640
You figured that out by doing what Wes? Well, I just headed over to their

31:52.200 --> 31:54.780
Docker hub page and they had a big list and then they also I mean

31:54.780 --> 31:59.420
There's a bunch of spots in their docs and on github that basically list like these are our supported releases

31:59.420 --> 32:01.840
And then on the Docker hub page in particular

32:01.840 --> 32:07.200
They've got a big list of all the tags that correspond if you want to use Apache or Alpine or FPM

32:07.200 --> 32:09.840
You know all the various options of image flavors that they ship

32:09.840 --> 32:13.560
They've basically got one for each of those for each of the supported versions

32:13.560 --> 32:19.540
So go find the one that looks like the one you're already using except a newer version and slot that into your YAML

32:19.800 --> 32:26.780
Yeah, and then it was just a matter of rinse and repeat we would update the Docker compose tag pull that version

32:26.780 --> 32:29.880
We'd stop and start everything and then check to see if we could log in

32:29.880 --> 32:36.520
Take it all down. Let's take it all down. Shut it all down. Oh, yeah

32:37.720 --> 32:39.400
Okay

32:39.400 --> 32:46.080
So really the only thing that's gonna have a major update is Redis because we just said pull whatever latest version of that is

32:46.200 --> 32:49.120
But otherwise we've pulled tagged versions of everything

32:49.880 --> 32:53.920
So now she just I say up it and leave it on the command line so we can see the output

32:53.920 --> 32:59.920
See what happens. Yeah

33:02.840 --> 33:06.440
Creating next cloud. Here we go

33:10.520 --> 33:12.520
Okay

33:14.440 --> 33:16.820
The check will be able to see if it loads on your phone, right

33:17.480 --> 33:20.060
That's how we'll know because we didn't bring a computer out here

33:20.860 --> 33:22.860
besides the server

33:22.860 --> 33:28.340
Who needs it? Yeah, that's right out in the studio garage server room, okay

33:31.100 --> 33:33.100
Configuration complete ready for startup

33:33.660 --> 33:39.800
Set log level the debug turned on maintenance mode. We're upgrading hmm checking for app updates

33:42.380 --> 33:44.160
That seems normal

33:44.160 --> 33:48.940
Which seems to indicate a function in next cloud system if it's at that stage, that's a good sign

33:48.940 --> 33:56.340
That's you, isn't it? Is that you? Oh, yeah, we can see your we can see your web browser in the debug log

33:57.340 --> 34:03.460
You see all the stuff scrolling by is the login screen loads for Wes and we would do that each time as we step through

34:03.460 --> 34:09.780
I think there was a mid 17 release and then the 18 release and then we had one last update to do or

34:10.060 --> 34:12.760
Well, so we thought pretty confident. This is gonna work fine

34:13.300 --> 34:15.300
Dang it. Why'd you say that?

34:15.300 --> 34:18.260
Hahaha, did I just jinx us? All right

34:19.820 --> 34:21.820
So we start her up

34:21.940 --> 34:23.940
Let's do it a little console output

34:24.860 --> 34:29.740
You know watching this array work away all these lights flash. It makes me kind of miss

34:30.540 --> 34:36.300
Having that feedback aspect in my in my PC, right? You really feel it was working. Yeah, sorry

34:36.300 --> 34:39.980
No way you get nothing right but with these like I know what's going on

34:40.620 --> 34:43.020
Gives me a reassuring work. Okay. It looks like we're doing a

34:43.020 --> 34:49.460
Lot of updates are these apps? It's updating. Yeah, these are up. These are it's updating a bunch of apps right now

34:49.460 --> 34:52.620
That's what it's doing. Oh, well, I guess that's a good thing

34:53.300 --> 34:55.640
Let's do an a code integrity check. Hey

34:57.100 --> 34:59.100
Ready to handle connections

34:59.220 --> 35:02.700
Break out the old test device there West. Let's see if next cloud loads

35:03.940 --> 35:05.940
Come on, baby one more time. Yep

35:07.140 --> 35:09.900
says update successful maintenance mode has been turned off and

35:09.900 --> 35:11.540
And

35:11.540 --> 35:15.580
Reset log level and it looks like it's loading pretty painless. I got to say

35:16.220 --> 35:21.460
Every time we go through a process like this and it's pretty you know, essentially pain-free

35:21.460 --> 35:24.500
I get a little more confident in next cloud, you know

35:24.500 --> 35:28.380
So now it just needs to be like this for like another ten years and I'm gonna feel good. We'll finally be

35:28.900 --> 35:34.740
No, actually, this is really good. Now. We just rinse repeat on the Linode version of the server. You're right

35:34.740 --> 35:38.260
I mean kind of the test here is we're let's say occasional next cloud admins

35:38.260 --> 35:40.460
Yeah, it's a small piece of our overall setup

35:40.460 --> 35:42.940
So they doesn't get the attention that maybe it deserves right?

35:42.940 --> 35:48.820
It's really nice for this to be simple clearly out of practice when I jinxed us and said that should be all good now

35:48.820 --> 35:52.740
And because just about as we were done next cloud 20 came out

35:54.980 --> 35:57.180
That timing yeah, yeah

35:57.860 --> 36:00.780
But you know Wes we should talk about the bigger picture here

36:00.780 --> 36:05.020
The bigger picture is what we've done is as thanks to you primarily is

36:05.020 --> 36:10.740
We've spent the energy and time on getting both the hosted version of next cloud that's up in the cloud

36:10.740 --> 36:14.660
That's costing way too much at this moment and our local version

36:15.340 --> 36:22.500
Then you used a command to essentially use the sync system to pull a bunch of the data down from the cloud version to our local

36:22.740 --> 36:26.380
Version, can you talk about that? Yeah next cloud CMD

36:26.380 --> 36:33.720
I think it's called and it's just a built-in little one-shot command line client built into the standard next cloud client desktop application

36:33.720 --> 36:36.120
And you don't have to have it configured for the desktop

36:36.120 --> 36:39.760
I was a little worried about that since we were doing it on a mostly headless server

36:40.280 --> 36:41.840
But thankfully it's arch

36:41.840 --> 36:46.120
It was easy to get that client installed and then it accepts the credentials has got flags for it

36:46.120 --> 36:48.800
Or you can do it sort of URL style, you know like user

36:49.680 --> 36:52.840
Colon password at and then the HTTP address

36:52.840 --> 36:58.560
So we just pointed that in with the right user to sync down all the stuff that we didn't want to keep up in the cloud

36:58.560 --> 37:02.240
The stuff we needed to you know, we're gonna use day to day all the archival stuff

37:02.240 --> 37:06.200
Well, we're just gonna move that right into the garage. And so we set up that sink

37:06.200 --> 37:07.700
I think it was about

37:07.700 --> 37:09.040
120 gigs of stuff or so

37:09.040 --> 37:09.400
Yeah

37:09.400 --> 37:13.240
And then it was a matter of cleaning up the cloud instance and you have to then

37:13.560 --> 37:16.180
At least if you want to reclaim that space immediately

37:16.180 --> 37:20.280
You need to run a command on the command line to essentially delete everything permanently

37:20.400 --> 37:27.240
Yeah, you know you there's various setups the next cloud for keeping multiple versions hanging around and then also sort of defaults around like how long

37:27.240 --> 37:32.360
Is stuff gonna be in the trash? When does it get expired out of there and just the trash get cleaned up?

37:32.360 --> 37:34.720
So we just ran some commands in the command line

37:35.000 --> 37:40.720
Inside the Docker container with the OCC command to just sort of clean all that up delete anything that anyone had in the trash

37:40.900 --> 37:47.120
Delete any old versions hanging around and see how small we could get things and what we got it down to what like 30

37:47.120 --> 37:49.780
40 gigs now, I think it's I think it's more like 50

37:49.780 --> 37:51.000
But it was you know

37:51.000 --> 37:57.120
Pretty good and that includes anything all the various users have uploaded as well as our sort of working team folder

37:57.120 --> 38:04.200
Right and before we did the purge and moved everything down it was getting north of I mean because of all the undelete files

38:04.200 --> 38:08.900
I think it was somewhere north of three four hundred gigabytes. It was getting pretty big. It was over 400 gigs

38:08.900 --> 38:14.140
Yes, was it? Okay. Yeah, and that's why the cost was getting there so high and we knew that would eventually be an issue

38:14.140 --> 38:19.960
And so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna just kind of rework our workflow a bit and only keep certain folders up in

38:19.960 --> 38:21.960
The cloud and keep everything else

38:21.960 --> 38:29.060
Locally and there's a lot of ways we can make that available to our users from Federation to just having two separate URLs

38:29.400 --> 38:30.340
but

38:30.340 --> 38:37.440
What really I think was nice here is that the next cloud project is publishing these Docker images

38:38.040 --> 38:42.120
themselves and as a result they've taken the time to

38:42.720 --> 38:48.840
note which ones are stable releases and they've given you instructions on which tags to use and

38:48.840 --> 38:51.680
You can just tell it's a it's a first-class distribution

38:52.080 --> 38:59.640
method for the project and I think that gave me kind of a sense of confidence in the method we're using to deploy next

38:59.640 --> 39:00.900
cloud and

39:00.900 --> 39:07.720
we also as part of this are moving from a digital ocean droplet to a Linode server and I

39:08.200 --> 39:13.280
Don't know how much can we talk about that Wes because that's a tricky process since we're moving from object storage at

39:13.280 --> 39:19.400
Do to object storage at the node? Yeah, and while the object storage has been handy

39:19.960 --> 39:22.160
You know, it does have some tricks of its own one

39:22.160 --> 39:27.440
It's not really like a regular file system and to the way it's set up with the way we're doing it next cloud currently

39:27.720 --> 39:29.840
You don't have any of the regular file structure

39:29.840 --> 39:33.560
that's all kept in the database and you just get a bunch of files with sort of

39:34.080 --> 39:37.920
Database IDs for names all in one giant flat folder

39:37.920 --> 39:43.840
So that's a little unintuitive at least at first and doesn't kind of match up exactly with how you have it stored regularly on disk

39:43.840 --> 39:50.520
Right. So kind of step one is like we got to sync all that data from our previous s3 compatible storage provider over to our new

39:50.520 --> 39:55.040
Yeah, and there's a couple of ways to do that, but there is specifically like an s3

39:55.880 --> 40:01.920
Arcing compatible client right? Well, we're just using our clone which is so handy a great tool in general

40:01.920 --> 40:07.520
I know it's a favorite over at self-hosted as well because it's so nice for interfacing with all kinds of different cloud

40:07.520 --> 40:10.240
Clients and they've even got a very nice little home

40:10.880 --> 40:16.600
Configuration CLI interface too. So if you're not familiar with the dot files and config, it'll walk you through that

40:16.600 --> 40:17.760
You can choose who your provider is

40:17.760 --> 40:22.080
They've got a lot of default support and then just enter your credentials right there as it prompts you nice

40:22.320 --> 40:28.200
Yeah, our clones a great little way to also back up a website from the command line to say a Dropbox or Google Drive

40:28.200 --> 40:30.000
As well, there's a couple of options there

40:30.000 --> 40:35.000
So where are you going to use our clone to take data from one set of object storage to another set of object storage?

40:35.000 --> 40:42.680
So that'll be the data back in and then it's a matter of moving the config which includes the docker compose and anywhere

40:42.920 --> 40:44.520
that the docker

40:44.520 --> 40:51.280
Composes set up to bind to for data and configuration. We'll have to make sure that we have similar mount points on the new host

40:51.400 --> 40:58.640
We'll pull down the docker image and hopefully it'll connect to its previous configuration. It'll connect to the storage with new updated

40:59.520 --> 41:00.880
object storage

41:00.880 --> 41:07.880
URLs and in theory turn on although we're waiting to actually do it until this shows out because we don't want to screw things up

41:08.640 --> 41:12.300
But we're ready. Well, and there's one more piece there, you know over a digital ocean

41:12.300 --> 41:16.480
We were using a managed database, but we're gonna switch that, you know, we're not using this next cloud

41:16.480 --> 41:20.560
We're using it for less stuff. So we're just gonna run a Postgres database locally on the host

41:21.160 --> 41:27.280
So we've got to stand one of those up and make sure we've exported the database from the previous database host and move it over

41:27.280 --> 41:31.040
Right, right the database part. We were going with the hosted solution

41:31.040 --> 41:37.240
Which also will be a little bit of a cost savings and then that's an area where we're doing it kind of differently

41:37.280 --> 41:41.120
We're doing a different implementation in our local LAN setup of next cloud

41:41.120 --> 41:45.680
But it's all just implementation details at the end of the day the end users just see next cloud

41:45.680 --> 41:53.640
And so I imagine we'll probably stay around the 50 60 gig range on our cloud version and we'll probably keep about 125 gigs

41:53.640 --> 41:57.400
Or so and growing here on the archive version

41:57.400 --> 42:01.280
Yeah, and you know now we've kind of worked out as well if we need to do occasional, you know

42:01.280 --> 42:05.640
We've crewed a bunch of stuff up in the in the hosted version and need to move that down

42:05.640 --> 42:07.160
We've got that workflow figured out

42:07.160 --> 42:12.320
But here's what I kind of walked away with and I want to pass on to the audience if you're thinking about next cloud

42:12.320 --> 42:18.960
Or how you might rearchitect your next cloud. I'm really happy with this setup. We've used it for over a year now and

42:18.960 --> 42:24.880
Even when we kind of let things slip because well, honestly, we've been busy with a lot of things recently

42:24.880 --> 42:26.160
It's been really crazy

42:26.160 --> 42:31.760
And so next cloud just didn't get updated for a few releases and our data grew and more and more than it should

42:31.760 --> 42:32.480
Yeah

42:32.480 --> 42:36.800
And I think what I walked away with is not only did we learn how to do it better

42:37.520 --> 42:43.600
But the setup with running next cloud in a container with using object storage with creating

42:44.160 --> 42:47.360
These two different versions with an archive version and a cloud version

42:47.360 --> 42:51.120
That is super fast and accessible to our team that works around the world

42:51.120 --> 42:53.680
You know, that's one of the great advantages of the cloud version

42:53.680 --> 43:00.000
But our long-term storage on a local more cost-effective storage medium is great for archival purposes

43:00.000 --> 43:02.720
And also the requirements of that data just aren't as extreme

43:02.720 --> 43:06.400
You know our editors aren't trying to download and upload those files as fast as possible

43:07.040 --> 43:09.280
And that that combination I know it sounds crazy

43:09.280 --> 43:15.920
But two next cloud servers when you're managing via containers and your storage back end is super flexible

43:15.920 --> 43:18.080
Has been a bulletproof next cloud setup

43:18.080 --> 43:27.760
We went from 17 to 17 and a half to 18 to 19 and now to 20 in a real relatively problem-free progression

43:27.760 --> 43:32.400
It really wasn't very much trouble and we have modified these next cloud instances

43:32.400 --> 43:36.000
We've themed them. We've installed a fair amount of apps. We use them quite a bit

43:36.000 --> 43:38.640
There's a lot of storage there. There's a large database to track all of it

43:39.280 --> 43:40.800
I mean you name it

43:40.800 --> 43:42.480
We've put this thing through its paces

43:42.480 --> 43:44.480
Yeah, and I mean it's been pretty good

43:44.480 --> 43:50.080
Yeah, and I mean it's been pretty darn reliable even without us giving it as much care and attention as it might need

43:50.080 --> 43:54.720
Which I think we touched on a little bit in the clips, which is yeah, we're occasional next cloud admins

43:54.720 --> 44:00.080
We don't use it for all of the features. It has which are a lot impressively a lot these days

44:00.480 --> 44:05.360
We're mostly just using it as a nice ui on some and some file syncing, but even there, you know

44:05.920 --> 44:07.760
We can ignore it and it just keeps working

44:07.760 --> 44:11.600
I mean, it sounds like hyperbole, but I really feel like this might be the perfect next cloud setup

44:11.600 --> 44:15.680
Yeah, it is. It is pretty nice and especially coming as the casual sort of, you know

44:15.680 --> 44:18.240
We got to do updates and oh gosh, we got to move this thing

44:18.880 --> 44:20.880
It's nice not having to deal with as much

44:21.900 --> 44:24.560
Miscellaneous system state, you know, it's at least constrained

44:24.560 --> 44:29.280
We might not know everything about the ins and outs of how next cloud works or might have forgotten it since the last time

44:29.280 --> 44:31.280
That we had to do a lot with next cloud

44:31.440 --> 44:35.600
But there's a limit to how complicated it can be because it's just all containerized

44:35.680 --> 44:40.720
We've got container images. We've got volumes and we've got a database and then, you know a whole bunch of files

44:40.720 --> 44:45.120
But that's it. It's just some fundamental components and as long as we can deal with each of those

44:45.600 --> 44:50.560
It's not that complicated xml in the chat room is asking. So what's the cost update now?

44:50.800 --> 44:55.840
Well, we don't really know because we went from like nearly well, so I said over 400 gigs to

44:56.560 --> 45:00.000
Like 40 or we're going to be around 50 gigs when we're all done

45:00.240 --> 45:03.040
I just don't really know what that cost savings is because then at the same time

45:03.280 --> 45:08.320
We're going to transition from do to lanode and so there'll be you know, just a different pricing structure there

45:08.320 --> 45:11.360
So we'll give you an update after we've done it for a little bit

45:12.080 --> 45:16.240
I say go forth. This is a linux unplugged approved a setup boom

45:16.400 --> 45:21.520
it does look like you know if we were staying at do it would be significantly cheaper because I think that by default the

45:22.240 --> 45:27.680
Spaces are about five dollars per month up to 250 gigs. So ours was going up because we'd sort of exceeded that

45:28.000 --> 45:33.120
That's a pretty comfortable ceiling where we're at now though. Ah, yeah. Yeah, i'm sure i'm sure i'm sure it would be

45:33.600 --> 45:36.080
I want to say a big. Thank you to our

45:36.080 --> 45:41.860
Unplugged core contributors if you want to become a member of the show and get two

45:42.260 --> 45:45.300
Special versions made available to you go to unplugged core.com

45:46.260 --> 45:53.060
Not only do you help keep the show independent and keep an audience focused but we give a little thank you to you

45:53.060 --> 45:56.100
There's two perks really for the membership when you become a contributor

45:56.100 --> 45:58.580
You'll get an option for two different feeds and I guess in theory

45:58.900 --> 46:04.900
If you're a maniac you could subscribe to both of them nothing's stopping you but I I guess I always envisioned you'd select one of them

46:04.900 --> 46:06.900
Feed one is a limited ad

46:07.380 --> 46:09.780
version of the show same full production

46:10.580 --> 46:12.340
Just no ads

46:12.340 --> 46:15.140
Tight sounds good easy to listen to while you're commuting

46:15.780 --> 46:20.420
That's a great one. If you like the show a lot, but maybe just don't love the ads great feed

46:20.820 --> 46:24.660
But if you have maybe a longer commute or you want more content

46:24.740 --> 46:29.620
Even if it's not always 100 on topic or you want to just kind of feel like you're hanging out with the gang

46:30.100 --> 46:34.280
We also make the full live stream available all of our screw-ups

46:34.280 --> 46:40.360
The stuff that we cut from the show, which sometimes actual there's plenty. Yeah, like sometimes, you know

46:40.360 --> 46:42.360
We try to keep the thing at a certain run length

46:42.440 --> 46:45.720
And if I yap on too long we cut some of that stuff or anybody

46:46.520 --> 46:52.760
Yaps too much we cut that but it's in the full live stream all our screw-ups everything that never made into the show plus the entire

46:52.840 --> 46:57.400
pre and post show which is basically like a never show that is it like a whole nother show that

46:58.040 --> 46:59.480
Never gets released

46:59.480 --> 47:05.080
And it's just a thank you to those who help keep the show independent to keep us going unplugged core.com

47:05.800 --> 47:11.960
We're about 60 of the way to a single sponsor like how much we'd make from a single sponsor in the show

47:12.600 --> 47:15.400
That's really great. I mean i'm very happy with that. So thank you

47:15.640 --> 47:20.440
I'd love one day to get that to 100 maybe and we'll just keep delivering. We'll just keep trying to earn that so

47:21.000 --> 47:25.240
Uh, maybe you change your mind if you haven't done it yet, or if you can't we totally appreciate you just listening

47:25.240 --> 47:31.640
Maybe take advantage of our sponsors when they work for you or maybe share the show with somebody. We really appreciate that

47:31.960 --> 47:35.000
We're just glad you're listening. We just appreciate you sharing the show all of that

47:35.080 --> 47:37.240
Even if you can't contribute financially, but if you can

47:38.040 --> 47:41.160
You can then I think you know that this is a good investment. This is a good bet

47:42.260 --> 47:44.260
unplugged core.com

47:45.960 --> 47:47.320
Okay, wes

47:47.320 --> 47:53.480
I've been promised that we have an email that presents the last text editor that we'll ever use

47:53.480 --> 47:58.440
Should we get to it? Yeah, we probably should although actually this one came from our telegram group

47:58.520 --> 48:01.160
Which is another place you can ping us with feedback

48:01.400 --> 48:05.000
Although email is a little easier to sneak into the show with look at you

48:05.000 --> 48:10.280
You took somebody and you put it all up into a slexy.org document here and uh made it like an email for me

48:10.440 --> 48:15.800
I know how much you love talking about text editors. See what i'm saying. Yeah, you guys see what i'm saying about this wes, right?

48:15.800 --> 48:19.480
You see what i'm saying. All right. Well, so jitty wrote in telegram lately

48:19.480 --> 48:25.960
You've been mentioning text editors and listing some pics for editors on lup. He thinks perhaps i'm trying to replace nano

48:26.440 --> 48:28.440
I assure you that is not the case

48:29.560 --> 48:31.800
He says he goes on to say or they go on to say

48:32.120 --> 48:38.040
I heard you praise nano on the latest episode who me no never which I use until I found

48:38.740 --> 48:42.680
Micro it's probably the last terminal text editor you'll ever use

48:43.400 --> 48:48.120
Very sane and easy to figure out with default hockey syntax highlighting right out of the box

48:48.120 --> 48:53.080
And mouse support. It's kind of what nano should have been and it's written in go

48:53.080 --> 48:56.120
I was surprised micro didn't come up even in conversation on lup

48:56.840 --> 49:02.120
Also, I should add micro has a hotkey that exposes a host of other very powerful options

49:02.600 --> 49:08.200
Which basically gives you a cross between vim and nano overall the best feature though in my opinion

49:08.280 --> 49:11.720
Is the prompt that asks you if you meant to edit a file with sudo?

49:11.720 --> 49:18.280
Which then runs sudo if you answer yes. Okay, that actually seriously sounds great. Jitty syntax highlighting

49:18.920 --> 49:22.120
key combos similar to nano and vim and

49:22.920 --> 49:26.360
That problem where I am I edit a file that I meant to do with sudo

49:26.360 --> 49:30.600
But I just forgot that time and then I have to jump out is so frustrating

49:31.240 --> 49:33.640
That uh, I think I might switch to micro

49:34.280 --> 49:39.800
Wow, good work. Jitty, you know, this does look pretty nice. There's a ton of different editors, but that it's

49:39.800 --> 49:43.480
Go means it should be fairly simple for you to get on your system and set up

49:43.800 --> 49:47.560
And it does seem like it might be kind of a sweet spot for you chris where it's got some niceties

49:47.560 --> 49:53.960
You know, maybe you're editing a random, um, you know a random configuration file some yaml something where some syntax highlighting will come in handy

49:54.200 --> 50:01.160
But you obviously don't need all the complicated stuff in vs code or vim or something more full featured if it's just on a random server machine

50:01.400 --> 50:04.040
Yeah, especially if you need something that's on the command line

50:04.040 --> 50:09.400
Um, you want to take a shot at the pronunciation of this next one, you know, I think that's rain

50:10.200 --> 50:15.640
Writing to us about the next generation of linux users. Yeah rain writes in the previous episode 372

50:15.640 --> 50:20.680
You talked about the distro triforce and the next generation of linux users happily enough

50:20.920 --> 50:24.520
I am one of them. So I thought i'd write in what a great idea

50:25.160 --> 50:27.720
Uh, they go on to say i'm obviously still very new to linux

50:27.720 --> 50:34.840
But I already am sticking to one distribution as I want things to work on my only school laptop just as predicted

50:35.320 --> 50:40.760
During the show, um, which they say it was already quite difficult to convince my parents to let me use linux, by the way

50:40.760 --> 50:42.760
But i'm currently using fedora

50:43.320 --> 50:46.360
Uh, and I like the idea of dependencies thoroughly being checked

50:47.400 --> 50:51.800
So, uh, that's pretty great listening to the show live and uh p.s

50:51.800 --> 50:58.840
I'm looking forward to ms edge on linux as I currently have four different microsoft accounts for education and they're held to manage in a single browser

50:59.480 --> 51:01.480
You know, that's the second bit of feedback

51:01.560 --> 51:06.200
We got since last week where they where somebody's looking forward to edge on linux for various different use cases

51:06.600 --> 51:11.800
I guess at this point I am too. Really? No, not really. I am just curious. It's been so long

51:12.360 --> 51:15.880
It's interesting that they're you know, actually making it over to the linux world

51:16.680 --> 51:18.200
I want to see what it looks like

51:18.200 --> 51:23.800
Jordan writes in with the next cloud to-do system mentioned which kind of went well with today's, uh topic

51:24.600 --> 51:29.400
Jordan writes. I recently finished sorting out a to-do list system for the wife and myself and I thought i'd throw it out there

51:29.720 --> 51:34.600
The system has to be pretty cross-platform because my wife has an iphone and I have an android phone

51:35.000 --> 51:39.400
And while we both use ubuntu on our laptops. I primarily use an imac at work

51:39.640 --> 51:42.840
Oh, and well, I have a pine phone a pine tab and a pine book pro

51:42.840 --> 51:46.840
So, you know i'm kind of all over the place and i'm trying to figure out how i'm going to do that

51:46.840 --> 51:49.320
Kind of all over the place and I like to get work done on those too

51:49.400 --> 51:52.760
The actual functionality we need out of such a system is really quite minimal

51:53.320 --> 51:56.920
I think shared grocery list and you know a couple items with some due dates

51:57.560 --> 52:03.720
Other characteristics are open source integration with the operating system and well no more web apps if possible

52:04.120 --> 52:08.540
Nextcloud's cal dev based task apps fills out these requirements

52:08.540 --> 52:16.540
Nicely it integrates with the reminders app on macos and ios and gnomes to do app through the internet online account setup

52:17.020 --> 52:25.260
Without requiring any additional software on android. It's a bit more involved namely the next cloud app dav x5 and task.org

52:26.060 --> 52:29.100
Which is a lot you have to put it all together, but it really isn't too bad

52:29.580 --> 52:31.260
It kind of goes off the rails when you go from there

52:31.260 --> 52:38.620
But the primary drawbacks are really the reminders app on both ios and macos lack support for subtasks and the kanban

52:38.940 --> 52:42.300
Style boards like to do us now supports those aren't possible

52:42.460 --> 52:45.900
but jordan says try out nextcloud to do system it could be the way to go and

52:46.380 --> 52:49.580
I know I think I remember cheese mentioned he uses it drew

52:49.580 --> 52:55.740
Do you use any kind of task management system or any of these things built into nextcloud? Uh, not in nextcloud

52:55.740 --> 53:02.060
I just use google tasks. Oh, yeah, that's right. You're a google task guy, which does integrate with gnome to do

53:02.540 --> 53:07.260
Just fyi, right? I was just going to mention that it does look at that. Yeah

53:07.900 --> 53:12.620
James says should I be using memberful? I just signed up for patreon by is that a mistake?

53:12.700 --> 53:14.780
I'm confused between patreon and memorable

53:15.340 --> 53:21.740
So memorable is the white label service that we use for the core contributors. So if you want to support the show directly

53:22.300 --> 53:25.120
That's where you become a core contributor unplugged core.com

53:25.120 --> 53:30.320
If you want to support the network productions, that's where jupiter signal or the patreon comes in

53:31.120 --> 53:36.240
I am frustrated that wes and I burned a lot of hours on that sunday that we talked about

53:37.120 --> 53:42.720
Because I screwed up. I thought I could I thought I was gonna be able to offer a bundle of all of the membership shows

53:43.680 --> 53:46.400
To the patrons. I'm still working on a solution for that

53:46.400 --> 53:49.200
I thought i'd have it by now, but i'm trying to come up with something

53:49.600 --> 53:54.160
It may end up being a substantial discount for a bundle. I'm not sure what it's

53:54.160 --> 53:58.080
It's so much more stupid complicated than you'd think that's for sure

53:58.320 --> 54:02.160
And then of course, we want to tie all of it into our automation system and production. So that way

54:02.720 --> 54:07.280
Things go out on time for everybody when we release episodes and all of it. So it's a it's

54:08.000 --> 54:11.040
It's a lot of a lot of layers to this dip but right now

54:12.160 --> 54:16.640
In terms of just supporting the network helping us go independent keeping us going

54:17.360 --> 54:22.560
There's really two avenues you can you can support your favorite show memberships and really appreciate that

54:22.560 --> 54:27.360
And or you can support the entire network and that's done at jupiter signal now

54:27.680 --> 54:30.080
That kind of goes towards future productions

54:30.080 --> 54:35.280
Maybe shows that don't have sponsors that need to run for a while until a sponsor can land on them like

54:35.760 --> 54:38.080
Which is currently the case for linux action news

54:38.480 --> 54:42.880
That kind of thing the patreon enables it's not nearly enough revenue

54:42.880 --> 54:46.960
But it's sort of like an emergency budget that we we have access to

54:47.360 --> 54:51.120
And then if the revenues increase from there then we can leverage it for other things

54:51.120 --> 54:52.560
But that's what we use right now

54:52.560 --> 54:57.040
So we use patreon for to support the entire network productions at patreon.com slash jupiter signal

54:57.280 --> 55:01.840
And then our individual shows have membership programs not all of them, but some of them

55:02.560 --> 55:05.840
Those are linked at their respective websites like ours for examples

55:06.400 --> 55:10.400
Is like we mentioned the uh core contributors at unpluggedcore.com

55:10.640 --> 55:15.440
And uh, I just am very grateful for anybody who sticks in there, you know, one of the great things

55:15.440 --> 55:22.400
About these shows is they are a regular reoccurring thing that happens in the community

55:22.960 --> 55:24.960
You know, you can set your watch to them

55:25.360 --> 55:29.840
And it allows for like-minded people to come together and talk about something

55:30.640 --> 55:36.480
That has only really gotten better, right in 2020 has has brought a lot of bad things but

55:37.040 --> 55:40.400
Linux and open source and free software is all still pretty great

55:40.400 --> 55:46.880
And we really have a pretty smart sharp welcoming community. And so it's not just keeping the shows going but

55:47.920 --> 55:54.160
It's also about creating that welcoming community for everyone and the rallying around that and you know, it's been a wild year

55:54.720 --> 55:56.720
So I just really appreciate everybody's support

55:57.360 --> 56:02.160
It's really been something wess. Um, why don't we do one pick and then we get the heck out of here? What do you say?

56:02.400 --> 56:05.360
Oh boy throwing a wild pick out there. All right. What do you like?

56:05.360 --> 56:11.120
Well, I know you've been talking about this file converter pick you kind of were hemming and hawing that that didn't get picked last time

56:11.440 --> 56:13.840
Should we throw that one out there? Yeah, okay

56:14.400 --> 56:20.640
File converter, you know, this is interesting because it's something we don't talk about on this show very much but sneaks into coder radio

56:21.360 --> 56:25.220
Uh, and that's our friend web assembly. Someone took ffmpeg

56:25.920 --> 56:31.840
Compiled it with web assembly and stuck it up on the web for you to use file converter. Digital

56:31.840 --> 56:38.480
You upload your file, then you select your conversion type and then they're just throwing cpu power at this and it converts to a lot

56:38.560 --> 56:44.480
Of stuff this must be up on github, right? Like we could grab this and host it ourselves possibly. Well, that's a good idea

56:44.960 --> 56:50.000
Yeah, because this can't last forever, but this is a great idea. It looks really clean and simple

56:50.400 --> 56:53.280
Give it a go if you need to convert a quick file file converter digital

56:53.280 --> 56:56.400
It's been a while since we've had a website pick how westpain

56:56.400 --> 57:01.520
Oh, and it makes me think of maybe um, you know things like web assembly. I'm not i'm not saying it's the best approach or

57:01.680 --> 57:05.040
Even saying you should use it, but it's interesting to see and take some of these, you know

57:05.520 --> 57:09.440
Very useful command line apps that you might otherwise have to go spin up a linux server

57:09.680 --> 57:13.600
Learn how to use from the command line and instead just ship them right to the browser

57:15.760 --> 57:19.120
Well, you can find me on the social medias if you like i'm at chris lass

57:19.120 --> 57:23.200
I don't tweet a lot, but I do try to read everybody who tweets at me and reply to

57:23.200 --> 57:27.540
Darn near all of them. I'm on twitter at chris lass as well, or you can email me chris at jupiter broadcasting.com

57:28.240 --> 57:34.560
Westpain, have you decided to set up any social media presence? I know it's new. Yes, I suppose i'm over at westpain

57:35.040 --> 57:36.400
Well, there you go

57:36.400 --> 57:41.760
Breaking news, ladies and gentlemen, and uh drew. What about you over there drew at doom still drew of doom on twitter

57:41.920 --> 57:44.960
You got it. Haha. Well done, sir proud of you

57:44.960 --> 57:49.360
You can find our sponsor a cloud guru on social media as well youtube.com

57:49.360 --> 57:55.920
Twitter or facebook. They're just at a slash a cloud guru. We'd love to have you join us live next tuesday

57:56.560 --> 57:59.760
The show starts at noon pacific 3 p.m. Eastern

58:00.240 --> 58:04.240
You can convert that to your time at jupiter broadcasting.com slash calendar

58:04.560 --> 58:08.400
It uses the high-tech power of a google calendar in bed. I think I did

58:09.680 --> 58:11.280
70 years ago

58:11.280 --> 58:15.360
But it still converts it to your time and you can find us there. The show is at linux unplugged

58:15.360 --> 58:20.160
But it still converts it to your time and you can find us there. The show is at linux unplugged on twitter if you want

58:20.160 --> 58:21.200
to get

58:21.200 --> 58:22.640
news and of course

58:22.640 --> 58:25.380

374 thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the unplugged program

58:31.520 --> 58:33.520
And we'll see you right back here

58:33.520 --> 58:46.500
next tuesday

59:03.520 --> 59:05.520
So

59:14.560 --> 59:20.160
Not a huge fan of the new next cloud 20 ui. Have you seen this true? I haven't no

59:20.640 --> 59:24.800
It's like what would you call it a dashboard goat? You should probably look it up next cloud 20 new

59:25.040 --> 59:26.880
It looks like kubernetes

59:26.880 --> 59:28.320
Oh does it?

59:28.320 --> 59:29.760
I totally get what they're going for

59:29.760 --> 59:35.520
And if I used like all of the features of next cloud, it would be kind of nice to have like an outlook style

59:35.600 --> 59:42.880
Today screen I do think there is there is use to it. But because I primarily use it as a means of file storage

59:43.680 --> 59:46.320
It kind of just slows me down. It kind of just kind of it's one more thing

59:46.320 --> 59:51.040
I have to dismiss it. Maybe I can turn it off. You're supposed to figure out how to actually do something in it

59:51.520 --> 59:55.360
There are no clues no hints about what you're supposed to do once you're in the ui

59:55.360 --> 59:59.920
You can get past it pretty quick. You probably can turn it off. I may even be able to customize it

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:04.080
Uh, but for me what I really want is I know if anybody knows how to do this

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:09.520
Is i'd like to set my home screen to be several folders deep into our into our team folder

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:14.640
That would be perfect for me. I only ever go into the web interface

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:17.280
Uh very very rarely

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.960
mostly because one i'm syncing to my desktop and

01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:25.920
And two when I need things that are in there that are synced I can just

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:33.120
Log in using the gnome interface and it's right there in my file browser. So that is a nice thing

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:35.680
That is another nice reason to set it up. I'm never

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:49.780
In here like in the web interface unless I have to share it to somebody well because the web interface sucks
