00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,920
As we record, 10 years ago, Steam's beta went public on Linux.

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,240
It's been 10 years, boys.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,560
Congratulations, everyone.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,280
November 6, 2012, the initial beta was limited to just select participants.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,280
They wanted to work out early bugs and then they announced they'd be

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,800
releasing it to the wider public later as more Source Engine games became

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,080
available and they based the original Steam stuff on Ubuntu 12.04.12.10.

8
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,240
That's what I'm still running around.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And now, you know, with the Steam Deck out there, things are looking pretty good.

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:46,640
Steam on Linux was at a pretty healthy 1.28%, which is, I mean, 1% sounds small,

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,640
but when you consider the massive base of Steam and how it's always growing,

12
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,680
that's almost, you know, 1.3%.

13
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,360
That's pretty decent.

14
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,080
Mac's only at 2.23%.

15
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,200
So we're sniffing at the bottom of the Mac heel right now.

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,720
And as the Deck sells, there'll be more and more soon.

17
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,640
That's pretty nice to see.

18
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,840
You know, you look at where Valve's at now with Linux, it seems like we're in a

19
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,360
pretty good position for that market share number just to get bigger and bigger.

20
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,040
Yeah, right.

21
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,800
It's getting great.

22
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:25,360
I think it's only getting better.

23
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,360
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

24
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,320
My name is Chris.

25
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,240
My name is Wes.

26
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,200
And my name is Brent.

27
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,480
You're back.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,680
Welcome.

29
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,440
Thank you for having us again.

30
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,720
The boys are back in town this week and we're surprising each other with three

31
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,520
unknown topics, so I can't tell you what we're going to talk about because I don't

32
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,040
know.

33
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,960
What I do know is that I've got a big update on my Odroid H3 Plus.

34
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,800
Finally, really looking forward to telling you about that.

35
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,520
And I know we'll round out the show with some great boosts and picks and a lot

36
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:56,960
more.

37
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,520
So before we go any further, let's give a shout out to that virtual lug.

38
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,400
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

39
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,640
Hello, guys.

40
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,080
Hey, Wes, and hello, Brent.

41
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,320
Hello.

42
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,000
Hello.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,320
Hello, and hello, everybody up there in quiet listening.

44
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,600
We got a big crowd up there.

45
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,040
They're being very quiet today.

46
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,680
That's the nature of it.

47
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,640
But are they listening?

48
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,640
I hope so, because I'd like them to go over and say good morning to Tailscale.

49
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,160
Head over to tailscale.com.

50
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,320
It's a mesh VPN powered by WireGuard.

51
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,200
We love it.

52
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,720
I used the heck out of it recently.

53
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,240
I just got to go into my most recent Home Assistant installation as well.

54
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,560
It's a powerful mesh VPN product.

55
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,800
Go say good morning to our friends over at Tailscale and use it for free up to 20

56
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,560
devices at tailscale.com.

57
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,360
Tell them I'm plugged a program, sent you.

58
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,080
All right. So before we get into the show today, we got to sort this out.

59
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,560
We got some geocache drama, and I don't know if Brent just has selective memory

60
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:59,160
holing or if I'm confusing locations and names again, but one of us is right and

61
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,840
one of us is wrong, and we've got to settle it now before we go any further.

62
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,480
So you put it in the doc, so I'll let you start, Brent.

63
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,560
Sure thing.

64
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,840
Jared wrote in with a little note that made me wonder if our geocache at Folsom

65
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,680
might be a flop.

66
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,520
Jared writes, I stopped by the Folsom geocache with my kids and spent over an

67
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,960
hour looking and digging around without success.

68
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,280
Just a note.

69
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,480
We didn't bury any of them.

70
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,320
Apparently that's a faux pas in the geocache world.

71
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,840
Jared continues, I met another fellow listener who happened to be looking for

72
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,720
it too, which was about, okay, that's amazing.

73
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,320
Isn't that great?

74
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,040
So that got me thinking, how many people are looking for this stuff?

75
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,960
I really want to know.

76
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,840
We love hearing that.

77
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,960
So please, if you went looking and didn't find, don't be disappointed.

78
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:43,720
Leave us a note.

79
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,120
We'd love to hear it or stash another one.

80
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,360
If it's missing, hide one.

81
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,360
I don't know.

82
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,640
That's actually a great idea.

83
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,760
I don't know how you'd market like a JB community one.

84
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,840
Maybe you put a note in there or something or a thumb drive with some JB shows.

85
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,400
Maybe we could send them some stickers.

86
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,720
We put in a t-shirt that we were hoping that was going to work.

87
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,600
Jared continued at this point, I think it's either one found by someone else

88
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,480
as the area doesn't, does get frequent traffic or two.

89
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,280
It's so well-hidden that we need another clue besides Chris's burnt trees.

90
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,040
Listen now, come on, why are you coming at me?

91
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,640
Why are you coming to me with that?

92
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,800
Oh, you hit the cache.

93
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,720
I was there in person, but I had no idea where you hit it.

94
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,960
You had to tell me and, uh, I looked for a little bit and had a hard time.

95
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,960
So I think that's, I mean, that's part of the balance, isn't it?

96
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,120
It's it's balancing, not having just random people find it because

97
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,800
we want our JB fans to find it.

98
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,480
But also, so it needs to be hidden well enough that not just a random person

99
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,240
finds it and the excuses come out.

100
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,200
You see how he's attacking my hiding styles here.

101
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,080
He's attacking me.

102
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,440
I had this exact same challenge on the other geocaches.

103
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,800
Oh no, I know what's going on here.

104
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,840
You see, here's what happened is I got a personally good, reasonable spot

105
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,840
to hide it, and then Brent couldn't find it.

106
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,480
So he's got it all in his head that I made it super hard.

107
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,640
And you know why?

108
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,240
Here's why he can't find it.

109
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,520
Here's why Jared couldn't find it.

110
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,360
I believe this was found almost immediately.

111
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:08,880
Oh, really?

112
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,240
I have a clear recollection on one of our shows, and I think it was the

113
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,200
peak of our travel, so we don't remember it.

114
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,040
But I remember in one of our shows, this was the first one that

115
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,240
got found was the Folsom one.

116
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,480
No, I disagree.

117
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,360
I think it's the one that Wes planted in that tree that got found first.

118
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,080
Mine was definitely found.

119
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,760
Okay.

120
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,720
All right, that might be true, but I swear, I remember talking about

121
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,560
the Folsom one being found, so we need someone else to go on location.

122
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,240
Okay.

123
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,960
Did we even ever hide one there?

124
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,560
At this point, I'm beginning to question it.

125
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,880
I've heard a lot of stories, but I think we need either trackers in these

126
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,200
things or something so that we could tell if they've been moved.

127
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,160
But actually, I think one thing that might help is maybe we need a central

128
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,840
place to collect all the geocaches and the status of them, whether they've

129
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,520
been found, not found, et cetera.

130
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,600
So, uh, actually take off seven, five, one on our GitHub suggested

131
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,680
that we implement such a system.

132
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,080
So I am going to put out a pledge.

133
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,600
Here you go.

134
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,320
You ready for this?

135
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:13,560
Oh, so by next Linux unplugged, that's in seven days, we will have a

136
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,320
geocaching tracking system in place.

137
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,000
Now it might not be fancy.

138
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,080
We've talked about in that issue, some really fancy ways of doing it, but we'll

139
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,680
at least have something and I will go back and try to figure out which ones

140
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,360
have been found, which ones haven't.

141
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,080
And I'll collect all of the, you know, coordinates and everything

142
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,080
in a nice, easy to find place.

143
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,000
There you go.

144
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,120
I believe the Folsom one has been found.

145
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,800
I will give a little bit more context because I'm looking at the

146
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,800
video I took of it right now.

147
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:46,080
And what I would say is you go down the trail to the shore where there's, um, a

148
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,800
river, no, it's a lake or whatever, and there is some burnt logs, pretty much

149
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,800
right off to the right-hand side when you're walking down there and those

150
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,680
burnt logs under one of them here, here, I'll show it to you too, Wes.

151
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,960
Maybe you can think of a way to describe this, but so here to grab the phone, you

152
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,040
can see the, that's the video right there.

153
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,920
How would you describe that spot?

154
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,000
It's just kind of down on the shore under some burnt logs.

155
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,440
I mean, it's not, there's nothing, not especially burnt from this picture,

156
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,160
just kind of some, some regular logs.

157
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,040
There's, I mean, at the time there was a bunch of leaves.

158
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,760
That's the one clue I give is burnt logs and youth.

159
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,240
Maybe the area is kind of previous.

160
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,520
No, I'm, I'm agreeing with Chris in person.

161
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,320
It's clear that that area, someone, I don't know, threw down a cigarette and

162
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,960
got burnt and everything else is super lush and green.

163
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,760
So I think the burnt part is actually a great tip because it's the only area

164
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,120
around there that sort of looks like that.

165
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,560
And Chris, when you had me in person, try to find it just based on our little,

166
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,800
this was the first one we dropped.

167
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,920
So he was like, okay, now try to find it.

168
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,040
I had a hard time because I didn't have any hints, but I think that

169
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,400
hint is actually a really great one.

170
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,160
Now that leads me to believe, I think someone else grabbed it.

171
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,960
That's just, that's my conclusion.

172
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,040
You could see if you're walking by it, you could see the blue.

173
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,400
I can't show it on camera, but you could see the blue of the lid walking by.

174
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,440
It's actually visible just walking by it.

175
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,800
It's not like, I like that you put a little bit of leaves over it, though.

176
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,120
Yeah, it's a little, it's like little, yeah, it's a little bit, but, um,

177
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,680
wasn't the lid red, it looks blue in the picture.

178
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,080
Uh-oh.

179
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,720
Brent, get it together.

180
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,640
How burnt was it?

181
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,680
You know, all right.

182
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,920
So, uh, you can come at me with my hiding styles or what lids I use, but the reality

183
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,640
is I think it was one of the first ones found.

184
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,240
So therefore one of the most successful, Wes is being thus most successful.

185
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,600
At least by one measure.

186
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,760
But anyways, we should do more of these because clearly there's not enough.

187
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,120
That's amazing that they're two different listeners at the same time.

188
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,880
We're out there better get out there while the weather's still good.

189
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,720
And Jared finishes, we had fun looking for it, nonetheless, and my daughter

190
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,400
implored me to get out there sooner.

191
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,880
The next time we have another geocache to find.

192
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,400
So thank you for putting it out there.

193
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,240
It was great meeting everyone at the Sacramento meetup and having this

194
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,680
fun little activity along with it.

195
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,200
Yeah.

196
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,880
Uh, you know what makes me just want to travel again a little bit, which is good.

197
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,160
I thought maybe I thought maybe my travel bone would be broken.

198
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,640
Although I have to say with the weather, what it is, I'm looking

199
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,920
forward to just hunkering down for a bit.

200
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,040
And, uh, I got plenty of projects to work on.

201
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,040
Oh yes, you do.

202
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,000
And the biggest for me personally, although probably not for the whole

203
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,840
family is my new home server to replace my dad, raspberry pie server.

204
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,240
Rest in peace, little buddy.

205
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,000
Yeah.

206
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,800
It's time came too soon.

207
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,120
However, the timing could not have been more perfect.

208
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,280
I was pretty bummed when the server died because my home

209
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,760
assistant setup was very complex.

210
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,560
I got like a lot of devices and I was like, I'm going to have to

211
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,960
a lot of devices and it was responsible for a lot of the automation.

212
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,480
But then additionally, like we just talked about, um, on the pre-show,

213
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,840
I like having my media locally because I'm often on a mobile connection.

214
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,200
Yeah.

215
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,920
And so I also had it serving up local media.

216
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,480
I have it doing all of our documentation and Markdown.

217
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,960
I had it running our DNS.

218
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,880
I had it running all kinds of things like smoke ping and, uh, sync

219
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,400
thing and, um, the heart of the RV.

220
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:06,840
Yeah.

221
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,920
And it died when I was down in Pasadena for the JPL tour, it was

222
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,480
back up in Sacramento dying and I didn't even know it, but the timing

223
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,960
was like unbelievable because when I arrived home from our road trip, my

224
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,520
home assistant yellow was sitting on the porch, just amazing.

225
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,320
After a year, I could crowds, I crowdfunded that thing like a year ago.

226
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,680
It shows up.

227
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,880
And so I get, uh, I get my home assistant set up going and it's rock.

228
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,160
And I talked about that and self-hosted recently, then right around the same

229
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:46,160
time, hard kernel folks announced the O droid H3 and the H3 plus, which is

230
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,600
an X86 based raspberry PI alternative.

231
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,920
It starts around $165 for the plus.

232
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,960
So a little spend here, but yeah.

233
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,920
X86.

234
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,480
And you get a quad core Jasper Lake processor, which goes up to 3.3

235
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:05,200
gigahertz, four cores, it goes up to 64 gigabytes of dual channel DDR4 RAM.

236
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,360
It has an MVME slot.

237
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,280
It has dual 2.5 gigabit NICs.

238
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,520
Oh, I've mentioned it before on the show.

239
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,240
It's like, it was the perfect solution at the moment that my system had died.

240
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,640
And I, I was waiting, I knew I needed to redo part of my setup anyways,

241
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,280
cause I had some home assistant issues, but I just didn't want to, didn't

242
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,800
want to go through all the hassle without also getting a performance

243
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,040
upgrade and then this stuff just, and, and not only did this get announced,

244
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,200
but they actually shipped it on time.

245
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,040
You have it.

246
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,600
I have it.

247
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,560
And so I've been running it in production over the last week or so.

248
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,680
I really banged on it pretty much all weekend.

249
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,800
This is like what I focused on the most when it was raining.

250
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,160
And, um, I am going to give it a Hardy endorsement.

251
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,960
I give this one the LUP seal of approval.

252
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,080
If you're looking for a low power device, when this thing is running idle, just kind

253
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,480
of, and I would define idle as your services are loaded, but nothing's really

254
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:04,000
being taxed 1.5 Watts for an X86 box.

255
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,320
I can run any X86 application.

256
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,360
I want, it's got a modern Intel processor with quick sync.

257
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,360
I've got super fast storage, 1.5 Watts.

258
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,000
That seems amazing and impossible, but how does it compare to arm stuff?

259
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,880
Is it, it must be in the same area.

260
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,520
It's around there.

261
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,680
That is crazy.

262
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,080
Where it, it can go up a little higher.

263
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,760
I think it's depending on your load.

264
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:26,360
Yeah.

265
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,160
What you're doing with it.

266
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,360
I actually, I haven't really seen a lot of that.

267
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,840
How does it feel to be back on X86?

268
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,680
I feel like another way to spin this little segment is a Chris abandoned arm.

269
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,000
Well, I don't know about abandoning arm forever, but I am done with the

270
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,920
raspberry PI I no way, not compared to this.

271
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,120
This blows it away.

272
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,080
Oh, it's I'm done with the PI.

273
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,400
Seriously.

274
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,680
I never thought this day would happen.

275
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,920
Are you feeling okay?

276
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,320
It's the storage, it's the CPU.

277
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,840
It's the two SATA ports having a, so I also picked up a four terabyte

278
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,000
Saturdays from Amazon for like a ridiculously great price.

279
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,520
And I hooked it up over SATA and now I have, I've gone from USB

280
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,560
storage to actual SATA storage.

281
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,920
And the only thing I'm not really satisfied so far with the

282
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,360
old droid would be the cases.

283
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,200
They're kind of clunky.

284
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,200
They're kind of rough.

285
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,720
They're a good price, but if anybody knows the better cases, I

286
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,760
would definitely be interested.

287
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,840
Have you had a chance to play with the dual NICs yet?

288
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,200
Cause I'm real curious about that.

289
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,600
No, I only, I'm only using one.

290
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,720
I don't actually need dual in this, but not buying raspberry pies anymore.

291
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,560
So like when I do eventually get this firewall set, we get a firewall

292
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,320
set up here at the studio.

293
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,240
I'm going to go with one of these.

294
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,800
I'm done with the raspberry PI.

295
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,000
I'll find something to do with a few of them I have left, I guess,

296
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,080
but it's just so much better.

297
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,160
Melt them down in a sort of ceremonial.

298
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,000
No, I mean, I'll use them for something, but I don't know.

299
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,880
Maybe mine Monero.

300
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,520
I've got another question for you.

301
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,760
I noticed there's a massive fan on that case, which in one way is probably

302
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,840
good because it's quiet or quieter.

303
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,240
I'm curious, have you had a sense of the heat output on that thing?

304
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,640
I'm not pushing it a lot.

305
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,720
So I've been checking it and now I'm also monitoring the booth, you know,

306
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,440
cause it's in the booth and the temperatures are all totally normal.

307
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,720
So I don't have a fan on mine.

308
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,520
The case does have room for a fan.

309
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,840
It does not come with a fan, but they sell a series of accessories for this thing.

310
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,760
Including a fan, if you want to run it with a SATA disk, make sure you get a

311
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,280
power cable because you're going to need that.

312
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,880
It doesn't, it doesn't come with that.

313
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,760
Well, one of the things that's made this real great, got to give a shout out to

314
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,320
Nix, never saw that coming.

315
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:32,760
So what I did before I decided to deploy this thing is I took my dev one because

316
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,160
I'm, I was getting a new, can pave it to put fedora on there anyways for testing.

317
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,840
So before I did that last week, I, uh, put a fan on it and it was, it was

318
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:45,720
working, I did a minimal Nix install and started configuring it.

319
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,600
Like I was going to set up the Odroid on my dev one laptop.

320
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,440
So I got jelly fins set up.

321
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,040
I got my storage mounted where I wanted it with everything in the

322
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,840
right file systems and all that.

323
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,520
Got all, got all this stuff kind of preloaded and configured, figured out

324
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,680
what I didn't like, fixed a few things, got some tweaks going.

325
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,080
Yeah.

326
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,720
And then when all the parts arrive for the Odroid, which is really, I was waiting

327
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,920
for it, I just sat down and I decided to do a GUI install because I'm lazy.

328
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,080
And also I just wanted to run, I wanted to get the Odroid all the way up to a GUI

329
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,720
again, right?

330
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,360
So make sure everything was there, test the networking, test everything.

331
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:26,560
And so I went and I grabbed the NixOS gnome installer and ran that, did a live

332
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,240
session, made sure everything was working, made sure I could see the storage.

333
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,040
Everything was good.

334
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,440
Cause I brought the disks with me.

335
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:37,240
I had them attached to the dev one over USB, but on the Odroid, I

336
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,440
had them installed over SATA, but it all still worked.

337
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:39,760
No problem.

338
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,520
It was still dev SDA on both of them.

339
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,000
Perfect.

340
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,280
So I get everything going, launch the installer and I choose the minimal

341
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,080
install option, which is fantastic.

342
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,600
So when it's all done, it reboots into a headless setup, essentially,

343
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,840
and a real minimal config.

344
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,120
And so then I just SSH in, drop my config that I kind of built over a week on the

345
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,760
dev one onto the Odroid, do the old Nix config rebuild.

346
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,280
And, uh, within like, I don't know, 15 minutes, I mean, maybe not even that

347
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,320
the thing was crazy fast and it's pretty minimal install.

348
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:16,040
I rebooted and I had everything and you're done and like everything worked.

349
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,080
It was incredible.

350
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:22,240
And I opted to use containers for a couple of things instead of using the

351
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,320
next package manager of mostly for my media stuff.

352
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:31,120
So sync thing, jellyfin that's all via container, but then things like net data

353
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,480
and duplicati and all, of course, all of like the command line tools, that's all

354
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,160
installed via the Nix system.

355
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:43,880
I'm thinking this is going to be a really solid long-term install because I have

356
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,600
rollback capabilities with Nix now.

357
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,000
And it's a pretty minimal base install and config, and it's all just

358
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,280
defined in that config file.

359
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,040
Easy to back up.

360
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,720
Easy to, I already have it backed up.

361
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,360
And so I think I can just keep that base system rolling and I'll just update the

362
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,320
application containers that I run in containers over time.

363
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,920
And I think with the performance of the Odroid.

364
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,320
You're not going to be super taxing this box all the time, right?

365
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,200
So we can just kind of sit there, hum along, do what you need it to.

366
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,920
I think I'm going to get a quick sync as you said, so it's not even going to have

367
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,360
to be like too hassled there.

368
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,280
Years, years, Wes, years.

369
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,840
I'm going to get years of use out of this.

370
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,640
Wait, but then what are you going to do if you're not constantly

371
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,720
rebuilding your home server?

372
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,840
I'm going to be buying more of these things and putting them in all kinds of

373
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,360
places.

374
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,880
I mean, I ended up with like four raspberry pies over time.

375
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,680
This is so it really, they hit it out of the park.

376
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,480
The 1.5 Watts at idle matters a lot because there are long stretches of time

377
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,520
where I'm running off solar.

378
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,520
And so anything that runs consistently matters, even if it's just a couple of

379
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,200
Watts over a 24 hour period time or a, you know, a week, that really adds up.

380
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:42,600
Okay.

381
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:42,920
Okay.

382
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,320
Do you think you could do a show off?

383
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:53,400
I was wondering, I was wondering, um, definitely, definitely fed a PCI slot.

384
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:54,560
Definitely.

385
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:54,840
Yeah.

386
00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:01,840
But, you know, the disc guy, it was really fast, maybe, it would depend on

387
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,040
the CPU and all that, but maybe I've thought about, I've thought about,

388
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,120
could these be used as a desktop?

389
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Swap out the studio.

390
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,120
You know, we got to replace these studio rigs.

391
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,080
That's actually what I was thinking is the Reaper machine.

392
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:17,440
I was thinking because it'd be silent, tiny little thing, more space below here

393
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,360
for fun snacks.

394
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,440
Cheap, right?

395
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,080
I love how your, your thoughts, what, two weeks ago was to put out a

396
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:27,000
Thalio in place, and now you're talking about putting this right there.

397
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,600
No, the Thalios, no, the Thalios is going to, no, no.

398
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,000
The Thalios is for the OBS machine.

399
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,440
That's sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

400
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,440
We might get that ordered tomorrow morning, but for the Reaper machine.

401
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,520
That's a different, that's a different set of requirements.

402
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,600
It might work.

403
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,360
It might work.

404
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:40,840
Yeah.

405
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,160
I'm very, very impressed.

406
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,680
And I've done two separate orders.

407
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:50,080
So I ordered the Odroid and then I also had to order a, like a cable pack and

408
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,960
stuff, and I'm like, okay, I'm going to order a Thalios.

409
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,640
Bull shipments were just, I mean, not as quick as Amazon, but within a few

410
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,400
days they arrived, no problem.

411
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,560
Like, no supply chain issue.

412
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,240
Availability feels good.

413
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:03,760
Yeah.

414
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,840
I'm very, very impressed.

415
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,800
That matters when you need a replacement in a pinch or, you know, the next piece

416
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,600
for your next project.

417
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,280
So I'm going to get, uh, going to get just things kind of dialed in on this thing

418
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:13,440
now.

419
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,480
I got tail scale set up on it last night.

420
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,360
And so that's, that's going now.

421
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:23,120
And I got, um, a real kind of nice, clean, like I really took everything I've kind

422
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,240
of figured out over the last couple of years since I built the Raspberry Pi and

423
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,320
applied it to this one.

424
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:28,720
Yeah.

425
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,760
It's my first Raspberry Pi builds were Raspberry Pi OS.

426
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,200
And that just doesn't make for a good server.

427
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,120
What a world ago that was.

428
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:41,040
And then my second generation, which is what my PI server was that died.

429
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,560
My second generation of Raspberry Pi builds was all based on Ubuntu, I think

430
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,360
2004, their first LTS that officially supported the PI.

431
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,400
And I got to give Ubuntu credit.

432
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,680
It worked really, really well.

433
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:58,000
It did a very good job for what I needed, but there's a lot there compared to a

434
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,080
minimal Nix install.

435
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,840
There's so much more installed on that Ubuntu system and so many more services

436
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,680
and like snap stuff that I didn't want on the server.

437
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,880
Just a bunch of things you don't particularly care about that might be nice

438
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,480
on a more generic server, but not for what you're doing here.

439
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:17,480
And there was something really nice about getting a, kind of like having a system

440
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,720
to make mistakes on, on the dev one and do things wrong a couple of times.

441
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,640
Cause like one of the things I did the first time is I tried to just do JellyFin

442
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,400
as just using Nix.

443
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:27,800
Yeah.

444
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,360
And one of the things I discovered is that presently, although they're working on

445
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,160
it, but presently they have an older version of JellyFin packaged in Nix.

446
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,520
You think of it as a rolling distro, it's got everything brand new, but in this

447
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,200
case, JellyFin was actually out of date.

448
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,440
And there are solutions to solve that on Nix, but then I also have to solve it for

449
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,160
FFmpeg because I need a version of FFmpeg that works with JellyFin.

450
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,920
And then I also have to solve it for this plugin that I'm using.

451
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,560
That's based on a certain version of JellyFin.

452
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:55,760
It kind of just started becoming like this rabbit hole of like fixing stuff to

453
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,920
make it use the Nix system versus I could just go get the container that just had

454
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,200
it all.

455
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,320
And obviously NixOS runs containers just fine.

456
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,120
Exactly.

457
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:06,200
So that was sort of one of the things I realized on my test system was like,

458
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,440
maybe I won't do it this way.

459
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:07,760
Yeah.

460
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,720
I can see it's nice not having to worry about containers and not worrying about

461
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:16,480
any of that, but for these media applications, Plex2, the creators of these

462
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,160
containers have done things to optimize like hardware transcoding and stuff like

463
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,400
that.

464
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,080
And you probably, a lot of these, like you don't really want to look inside,

465
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,280
right?

466
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:24,760
You don't really care.

467
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,480
Like as long as it works and it pops up its web interface and like does the thing,

468
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,520
you're not trying to go mess inside the container anyway.

469
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:29,680
Yeah.

470
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,000
It's not like a, it's not like a core business tool.

471
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,280
It's how I just want to watch something on my TV and I just want to watch something

472
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:35,680
on my TV.

473
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:35,880
Damn it.

474
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,720
You know, now when it goes down, it suddenly becomes a core business tool,

475
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,760
but you know, yeah, right.

476
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,800
No kidding.

477
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,040
Uh, at least for me, but, um, you know, I, so I made those mistakes, fixed them.

478
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,640
And the beautiful thing is, and then I'm all done on this, but the thing I just

479
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,760
effing love about Nix is the moment I realized, yeah, this is probably better

480
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,480
as a container.

481
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:02,400
I just went and commented out the stuff I added to the Nix config, rebuilt, and it

482
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,280
was like, I never installed Jellyfish.

483
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,200
It was like, it was never there.

484
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,960
It was a totally clean system again.

485
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,800
So nice.

486
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,360
It's so nice.

487
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,480
And then I just went and got the container and it's like, never did that.

488
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,520
Nothing, nothing.

489
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,880
You know, just pretend like I never made that mistake that you can just have

490
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,240
access to this giant array of software that you can just sort of arbitrarily

491
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,000
compose together into different systems whenever you want in different ways,

492
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,320
which everyone works better for me too.

493
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,720
It's such a great platform in that regard.

494
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,280
And you just have to invest the time and, and you have to, you know,

495
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,480
invest the time in educating yourself to figure out which one works right.

496
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,200
And sometimes you just have to do it the hard way, like I did.

497
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,080
Try it one way, but I love that.

498
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,360
And then, and then the thing that makes it so great is I just pick that config

499
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:48,760
file up, drop it on the new rig, rebuild, off to the races and done.

500
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,720
So it was a real success and getting the Odroid up and going combined with the

501
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:59,120
compatibility of x86, but the power usage of like a traditional ARM system really

502
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,040
hitting the sweet spot for me.

503
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,480
Hey, good job x86, I guess too, huh?

504
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,280
That's that's impressive.

505
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,640
Linode.com slash unplugged.

506
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,920
That's where you go to get a hundred dollars in 60 day credit for a new account.

507
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,400
And it's a great way to support the show while you're checking out something

508
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,680
pretty great, IE Linode.

509
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,200
Linode is easy to use and powerful cloud hosting.

510
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,560
They have 11 data centers around the world, soon to be like another

511
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,280
dozen over the next year.

512
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,480
But really I think the key thing is that a really solid Linux infrastructure.

513
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,920
They make it super quick to deploy systems and you get to choose from a

514
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37,800
very wide range of Linux distributions, pretty much all the great distros.

515
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,880
And there's even guides on how to build it up from the ground up.

516
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,160
We've done that a couple of times for various reasons.

517
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:50,800
They now also offer bare metal servers and we use the absolute snot out of

518
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,000
their S3 compatible object storage.

519
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,000
That's what's behind our peer tube instance.

520
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,760
That's what's behind our next cloud instance for our team here.

521
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,280
It's just kind of like our go to solution for anything that's going to

522
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,960
sort of have a various amount of data.

523
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,960
I don't want to like slice off this like, like an old caveman or something.

524
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,040
They have a brilliant VLAN support where you can actually bridge different

525
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,040
Linode data centers together, a powerful DNS manager.

526
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,240
They support Kubernetes, Ansible and Terraform.

527
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,440
If you're using that tooling, super fast networking because they are their own

528
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,320
ISP and their pricing is 30 to 50% cheaper than the other major cloud

529
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,120
providers out there.

530
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,760
And they're a true, genuine Linux loving company.

531
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,200
They started because they saw what you could do with VMs and Linux before,

532
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,960
before there ever was an AWS or cloud hosting, as we call it.

533
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,440
And because of that, they built a company around the merits of the product, the

534
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,880
capabilities, the speed, the features, the reliability, and the support.

535
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:50,880
They have 365, 24 seven support by phone, top tier support when you call them.

536
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,360
Additionally, they have tons of resources on their website.

537
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:59,240
Just a couple of days ago, they posted a, how to revert your last Git commit

538
00:24:59,240 --> 00:24:59,760
tutorial.

539
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,520
This is really just a tutorial to get you going on Git.

540
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,560
We talk about it all the time here, but what about some practical examples?

541
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,760
How do you actually roll things back when you make a mistake?

542
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,680
They've got an absolutely free tutorial.

543
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,920
It's really nothing Linode specific about it.

544
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,560
It's just about getting you those skills.

545
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:20,640
And then I think they hope something you'll be able to use on Linode, get even

546
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,200
more out of Linode, I would imagine.

547
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,520
Lots of great tutorials. I'll put a link to this one.

548
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,000
How to revert your last Git commit.

549
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,800
What a great guide.

550
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,960
I'll put a link to that in the show notes.

551
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,640
I love that kind of stuff about Linode.

552
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:34,800
Great online resources, great technical resources in the company and a website

553
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,600
that I've noticed.

554
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,720
Everyone on our team at various skill levels can use to manage the systems.

555
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,440
It's really fantastic.

556
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,640
And their community support runs super deep as well.

557
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,120
So go get that hundred dollars and support the show.

558
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,920
You go to linode.com slash unplugged.

559
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,800
That's linode.com slash unplugged.

560
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,280
We do have some housekeeping to get to this week.

561
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,200
I think number one, we got to talk about, I promised to try to bring it up earlier

562
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,640
and I'm already sliding on that.

563
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,560
The tuxes are coming up.

564
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,880
So we're getting serious about this year's tuxes and we're looking for people to

565
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,080
help us maybe organize it, work on the submissions, get the questions in better

566
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,160
shape. I have launched a tuxes boardroom.

567
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,640
Put your tuxes on folks. Yeah, get your best on and come join us.

568
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,920
We'll have a link in the show notes if you'd like to join us in Matrix and help us

569
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:28,200
organize this. Or you can go to bit.ly slash tuxes board and that'll take you there.

570
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,320
Tuxes board. Who doesn't want to go there?

571
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,840
And we'd love to have you join us in there and help make the tuxes the best awards

572
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,640
ever. It's the number one award show.

573
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:41,480
I mean, we have, you know, out there, there's a lot of really great projects and we

574
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,160
won't help you out there, but we want to make sure that you get the tuxes board.

575
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,640
We won't help trying to try to honor them.

576
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,880
Yeah. Is that next cloud instance?

577
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,760
It's still up, right? I got to start it with a little blank entry.

578
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,920
We can start crafting. Yeah.

579
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,800
So if we could find enemy, we could work on it.

580
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,480
Perhaps somebody feels like they do a better job.

581
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,040
Yeah, definitely possible.

582
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:03,520
We're already sliding. Then we could give them access to the next cloud instance.

583
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,960
And that's where we have the forum that gets composed over there.

584
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,600
And if you have ideas on things that we didn't get in the tuxes last year, that

585
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,120
should be in the tuxes, you can boost them into the show or you can join that Matrix

586
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,680
chat room and let us know as well.

587
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:21,760
Now, there is an event going on, kicks off tomorrow as we record and it runs through

588
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,240
the ninth. It's something that we haven't said for a long time.

589
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,520
It's been gone. It's been missing from the community calendar.

590
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:32,560
And it is the Ubuntu Summit 2022.

591
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:38,600
It's back. And Brent wanted to get you all, I guess, up to date on it, I guess.

592
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:39,880
You can't go.

593
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,880
I noticed that there's registration for kind of tuning in remotely.

594
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,320
I don't think all the talks are being streamed, but I think the main room is being

595
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,680
streamed. So they have a bunch of tracks, including the Ubuntu desktop, of course,

596
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:57,720
which seems obvious, but some community tracks and data science, app ecosystems,

597
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:02,000
infrastructure, devices and content and design, which is, you know, close to my

598
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,440
heart. And so I just thought, you know, the people should know this is happening.

599
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,520
I know you can go ahead and register right now for some remote viewing stuff.

600
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,680
I wasn't able to find a link right away to where it's going to be streamed, but I'm

601
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:20,120
sure they've got that all figured out and we'll probably get an email or something

602
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,000
with where it's going to be at. So that's my little PSA.

603
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,840
That's great. There was a possibility the JB team was going to make it, but it just

604
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,320
didn't work out scheduling wise.

605
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,000
So hopefully this will become a trend that they'll keep doing.

606
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,400
It certainly seems like Canonical's really excited about it, and I'm really curious to

607
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:43,600
see what this new era of celebrating the really awesome Ubuntu community that exists is

608
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,440
like. There's a lot of neat folks in it and participating and helping it grow and, you

609
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,880
know, keep it diverse and active.

610
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,240
It's nice to see these kinds of things showing up more.

611
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:58,800
I agree. It's something that I'm really happy to see because it brings all the

612
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:03,960
stakeholders together in a way that can help make the Linux platform better, regardless

613
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,320
of which distribution you're using.

614
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,640
Yeah, message we can all get behind.

615
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:14,160
I will say, if you are planning on joining in, it is happening in Prague, and so you

616
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,160
might have to check the time zones on that one.

617
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:21,040
I think if you're in the Pacific Northwest, it starts at like 1 a.m.

618
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,320
tonight. So that's something to take into account.

619
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,600
Just check their calendars.

620
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,640
I'm sure they make it nice and easy for you to figure it out.

621
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:31,440
It would be great if they posted the videos on something like YouTube so people could

622
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,720
see what it's about. I can tell you just from behind the scenes.

623
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,440
It seems like they're very serious about this.

624
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,320
They're really committed to it, just communicating diligently with us.

625
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,520
And they're clearly trying to bring in as many people as they can and cover a wide

626
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,520
range of topics. I used to love these things.

627
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:50,360
Yeah. So here's hoping that this becomes an ongoing yearly thing.

628
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:54,680
And I think it also shows a sign that Canonical is willing to spend real money to

629
00:29:54,680 --> 00:30:00,320
invest in the community, because I have a sense they are flying in a lot of people.

630
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:06,240
And the cost of that and stay and all of that and the food is just astronomical.

631
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,480
So it's a big commitment.

632
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,480
And then also just a PSA.

633
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,960
We're going to take a look at Fedora 37 next week on the show.

634
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:18,520
So if you'd like to download it and try it out and join us, join us.

635
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:22,040
Yeah. You can either listen along with it or join us in the Mumble Room.

636
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,600
Of course, we'll be live noon Pacific, 3 p.m.

637
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,160
Eastern over at Jupiter got to.

638
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:33,520
And then last but not least, also on our radar, the end of year holiday loves.

639
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,600
They're coming up. You can boost in your prediction or you send an email.

640
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,200
I was thinking people could use 20, 23 sets for their for their predictions.

641
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,120
Oh, I like that.

642
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:46,560
Go to Linux Unplugged dot com slash contact to send in your predictions to start

643
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:50,400
collecting some of them and then Brent will read through them and steal a few of them.

644
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,080
Of course. Maybe I will, too.

645
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,440
I'm looking forward to it.

646
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,480
It's been a while because last year, it's been a while since we've done our pre-record

647
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,760
format for them, because last year luck just missed all the major holidays.

648
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:07,200
But this year we're going to land smack dab, I think, on Christmas or Christmas Eve or

649
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,480
something like that. I believe so.

650
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,000
And then and then New Year's.

651
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,480
Yeah. So there's that's right.

652
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,520
So there's that. Yeah.

653
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,800
So we're going to probably pre-record that so that I'll be coming up on the calendar at

654
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,440
Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash calendar.

655
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,320
But that's why we're putting the word out now.

656
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,800
We need your help. Yeah.

657
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,000
Because it'll be coming up sooner than you'd think since we're pre-recording.

658
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,480
So if you want to get your predictions in, boost them in 2023 with a little prediction.

659
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,880
And you know, we need help if you've listened to any of the previous prediction.

660
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,880
You do know, right?

661
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,280
Seriously, although I think maybe this is what it was my better.

662
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,920
Yeah, you're going to crush it.

663
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,360
Maybe I just don't read it already.

664
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:48,640
Speaking of boosts, we got one from Mike Piso 1970 and he sent in two hundred and

665
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:54,480
twenty two thousand two hundred and twenty two I'm a duck.

666
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:00,320
D.U.K. duck loaded with talent and it's also a big baller music.

667
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,760
Ice is Chris, Wes and Brent.

668
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,360
I've been a listener since episode one hundred and twenty five.

669
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,360
Oh, just a little after you started, Wes.

670
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,800
I usually just listen and then just consume the information.

671
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:17,400
Rarely do I comment or interact with the hosts of media, but I wanted to give back for all

672
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,320
that I've learned now that the Lightning Network allows me to do so for the first time I've

673
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:25,880
invested in Bitcoin, changed my podcast app, and I'm finally able to give you call two

674
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,680
thousand two hundred and twenty two a row of ducks.

675
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:33,080
Well, for my first boost ever, I am sending in you a row of super ducks.

676
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,680
That's where the two hundred and twenty two thousand two hundred and twenty two sats comes

677
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,320
from. Things are looking up for all that duck.

678
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,720
Thank you so much for everything.

679
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,240
Well, Mike, thank you.

680
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,440
Yeah, no kidding.

681
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:50,680
And Mike, you you don't even realize it, but you also put us at the top of the fountain

682
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,320
hot list for Friday night, Saturday morning.

683
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,000
So we picked up a new batch of listeners thanks to your boost.

684
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,360
That's so amazing.

685
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:04,280
On top of that, you came in at a really great week because our node was down twice, once

686
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,880
due to a software upgrade and once due to a very long power outage.

687
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,680
And so we missed a lot of boosts.

688
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,800
And so I appreciate that very much.

689
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,360
And this also is the week that John A lost his streak.

690
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:21,240
Oh, which we still know we we said we we said, yeah, he's welcome.

691
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,240
And he quit boosting. So that tells you something.

692
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,320
But I think he will join us in the studio at some point.

693
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,560
But so thank you very much, Mike.

694
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:31,080
We really appreciate it. It was sort of the perfect timing, the way it all came together

695
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,720
with your boost and and of course, the generous size of it.

696
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,400
It meant that we picked up some new listeners and I got a note from somebody who said, hey,

697
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,440
I found you in fountain today.

698
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,240
And loving the show. And it's just it's so awesome.

699
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:47,960
It's such a great thing because a Linux podcast is never going to be at the top of an iTunes

700
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,000
or Spotify chart.

701
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,200
It's never going to be at the top of their store ever.

702
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,760
Well, what about when Joe Rogan's our next guest?

703
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:59,720
Right. And it's incredible because we're on we're on a list of really, really great podcasts.

704
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,960
And it's it helps people with discovery.

705
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:07,800
I also love the idea of a new like an old time listener, which also just it's it's it's

706
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,840
also just it's always delightful when, you know, we get to hear from them.

707
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,320
Yeah.

708
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,880
Inspires a new listener to like that's that's just amazing.

709
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,440
It's also it's like price of Bitcoin is going to be low for a while.

710
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,400
It's a great time to experiment.

711
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,280
Sats are cheap.

712
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,160
Experiment.

713
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,720
You know, see how hard it is and play with the different stacks because they're self

714
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,160
hosting involved if you'd like.

715
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,440
And a lot of that.

716
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,400
So it can be a lot of fun.

717
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:26,440
All right.

718
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,840
So this week, we're three wild and crazy guys.

719
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,240
I have no idea what you all want to talk about.

720
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,720
But I'm really looking forward to these are some of my favorite episodes.

721
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,200
So let's start with Mr. Brentley.

722
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,920
He's been on the road hunting moose and doing family time.

723
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,320
And he's back now in his cottage.

724
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,920
And he's got a topic for us.

725
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:49,240
Yeah, I am, as some of you might have picked up over the years, a big fan of signal.

726
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:55,800
And I noticed that there's been kind of a snap signals snafu that happened recently.

727
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:02,760
There was a the signal snap had a bit of failure on multiple levels that was confusing at first.

728
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:08,680
But I've dug in and I'm hoping to just kind of touch on it here with the hopes of asking

729
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:13,400
one or two bigger questions once I'm done explaining what happened.

730
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:13,960
All right.

731
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:18,440
OK, yeah, I did hear something about this, like this, like they had to pull the snap

732
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,880
or something from the snap store.

733
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,640
Yeah, as far as I understand, it kind of vanished more so.

734
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:28,360
And then users who were using the signal snap just saw that it was missing.

735
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:35,800
And upon investigating with snap list that you can run on the command line, it just indicated

736
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,720
that it was in a snap quarantine, which I had never seen before.

737
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,920
Have you guys seen that before?

738
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,800
I have not.

739
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,840
No, I have not.

740
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:48,440
So that got me kind of like, oh, well, I like signal and well, snaps can be useful.

741
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,880
And I wonder what happened here.

742
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,760
And it turns out a lot happens.

743
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:58,440
Mostly a bunch of communication breakdowns from a bunch of different sources.

744
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:04,440
So those are the communication breakdown between canonical and their volunteer snap maintainer,

745
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,800
Galgalesh or Merlin Sebrecht.

746
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,160
OK, so this is a volunteer maintained signal snap.

747
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:17,160
Yeah, community maintainer who maintains like an unofficial signal snap, which we've seen

748
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,040
before in, you know, flat hub as well.

749
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:26,120
Some of these more popular applications are available, but aren't sort of the official

750
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:31,720
flavor that comes straight from the, you know, for instance, signal developers.

751
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:36,360
Well, generally, the company doesn't really often even know about flat pack packaging

752
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,600
or snap packaging, or they're not interested in supporting it.

753
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,720
And so somebody in the community is like, well, this is an in-demand app, so I'm going

754
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,480
to step up and I'm going to make sure it's packaged and God bless them.

755
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,200
Yeah.

756
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:50,040
But sometimes it's like a little bit of a security concern there, too.

757
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,880
I could see, especially with an app like signal.

758
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:58,360
Yes, it seems signal vanished and users noticed, but the snap maintainer didn't know about

759
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:04,200
it until they started seeing issues on their issue tracker and also just users saying,

760
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,080
hey, what's going on?

761
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:09,560
It's kind of missing and they expected to hear from canonical if something would have

762
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,600
changed there.

763
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:14,200
And so there's this kind of rabbit hole of different information that's a little bit

764
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,120
everywhere that I've tried to put together.

765
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:23,800
So from what I can tell Marlin, the snap maintainer discovered the problem from users who linked

766
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:28,200
some snap craft IO forums where users were asking the question, you know, where did the

767
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,040
snap go for a signal?

768
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:35,880
So Merlin responded, I had to find this out myself from users reporting it on our bug

769
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,440
tracker.

770
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:40,520
There was an initial communication breakdown between me and canonical due to how the snap

771
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:45,400
crafters publisher is structured canonical is changing their procedures to make sure

772
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,200
this communication breakdown doesn't happen in the future.

773
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:52,360
Due to how the snap craft publishers worked canonical was communicating with the wrong

774
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,280
person about the takedown.

775
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,960
They've since amended the process to make sure this doesn't happen anymore.

776
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:03,240
Now, Daniel Menrique, who works at canonical as a policy reviewer responded.

777
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:09,080
I have updated the process documentation to be very, very explicit about this.

778
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:14,520
For future cases, so it sounds like small communication breakdown there that seems understandable

779
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:22,840
because a huge delay in getting this resolved, but it kind of gets more complex from there.

780
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:27,960
Okay, so if I'm following they had to do a takedown, they do a takedown, but they don't

781
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,720
know who to notify properly.

782
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,320
So they just do it anyways.

783
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:35,480
And then through the process of like realizing they didn't notify the right person, they

784
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,960
come up with a new process, which they've now documented, but what's missing for me

785
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,440
is why they had to remove it in the first place.

786
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,960
Why was it so urgent to just rip it out of the snap store?

787
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:51,000
Well, I'm leading there and the reason I'm making it a bit of a question for you is that

788
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,160
this is exactly how the users felt, so I wanted you to feel exactly how they did.

789
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,720
So there was also a communications breakdown with users.

790
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:02,200
So at first in some of these threads canonical said the snap store administrators had to

791
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,480
remove the snap in accordance with our policies.

792
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,400
We hope to have it back shortly, and that's kind of all that they wrote in there.

793
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:14,040
So it was very cryptic, at least from what I can read.

794
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:22,280
So it turns out that the signal lawyers asked for a DMCA takedown of the signal snap.

795
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:28,920
And now it's not their official snap offering, so I suppose because of perhaps trademark

796
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:33,160
issues, that that is definitely something they can do.

797
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:39,480
Now Merlin, the community maintainer, just wrote a bit more once they did get involved

798
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,040
and dug into it behind the scenes.

799
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,880
This is due to a DMCA takedown request coming from the lawyers representing Signal.

800
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,080
Canonical is currently working with Signal to resolve the issue.

801
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:53,640
I've suggested to Canonical to be more transparent with DMCA takedown requests, similar to how

802
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,680
GitHub does it.

803
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,480
Last I heard, they were discussing that internally.

804
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:02,600
Due to how lawyers and legal threats work, Canonical is very hesitant to publicly talk

805
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,160
about what's going on, understandably.

806
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:09,960
You can expect a thorough postmortem after the legal issues are cleared up.

807
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:17,000
So I also noticed that Brian Acton actually spoke up about this on Hacker News.

808
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,280
I did not expect to see Brian Acton, the Signal co-founder, leaving a little message there,

809
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,800
which is kind of fun.

810
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:30,120
He wrote, we spoke to our attorneys and found that there was a breakdown in communication

811
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,280
between us and our attorneys.

812
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:37,360
We are working to rectify and reinstate the Signal desktop as soon as possible.

813
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,360
Sorry for the confusion.

814
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,200
You don't say.

815
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:45,920
So the lawyers preemptively went out, discovered this trademark violation, took action on behalf

816
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,920
of their client.

817
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,260
Do they just have like a blank check in which they're operating from?

818
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,600
So that's a good question, you know.

819
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,640
Is that actually the case or is this just them sort of covering their butts a little

820
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,640
bit?

821
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,640
Could be.

822
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,640
The lawyer is always a great one to blame.

823
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,080
I mean, that's part of why you pay them.

824
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:05,560
But I also could see it being like maybe there's just ongoing trademark protection.

825
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,820
You know, I could see something they would do.

826
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:08,820
Could be.

827
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:09,820
Yeah.

828
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:12,080
I know in the past they've had some issues with having Signal, for instance, in F-Droid

829
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,120
as well.

830
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:17,560
So there might be a history there that we could dig into a little bit more at some point.

831
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:22,040
But this whole kind of situation, which is multiple layers of communication breakdowns,

832
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:26,800
it sounds like, just got me thinking a few questions that I thought we could explore.

833
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:32,680
And I think the most obvious one is this third party app bundling that's happening for snaps

834
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,160
and also for flat packs.

835
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,800
I just wondered, is it still a good idea?

836
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:43,520
It was really essential when those platforms and technologies first came to light because,

837
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:47,320
you know, that's pretty essential to get users on the platforms is to have the apps that

838
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,840
you want to use, like, you know, the commercial ones.

839
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:56,840
And also, even though this is an open source application, Signal, it still has some trademark

840
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,840
issues there.

841
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:03,020
So I wondered, now that snaps and flat packs are a bit more mature, should we really have

842
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:09,840
the original developers be the snap maintainers instead of community members?

843
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,520
I wanted to get your thoughts on that.

844
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,800
Well, but even if snaps are more popular now, or, you know, these types of packages, you

845
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,120
still got to get the maintainers to be interested, right?

846
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:25,200
Like we wouldn't need it if they were interested in maintaining the snap themselves, we wouldn't

847
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,200
know.

848
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,200
Probably, hopefully none of this would have happened.

849
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,240
Yeah, that seems to be the chicken or the egg problem, isn't it?

850
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,200
And then do you get it on like multiple stores?

851
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,840
Is it going to be snap and flat hubs?

852
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,840
Right.

853
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,840
You know?

854
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,840
Yeah.

855
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,680
And I could see why they're hesitant to commit to that for sure.

856
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,800
I think maybe Canonical has struck the balance here a little better than flat hub has where

857
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:46,200
they make it pretty clear now after they've had some issues in the past, Thunderbird,

858
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,740
you can see is being published by Canonical.

859
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:53,240
They make the publisher clear, and then they also have this thing called a verified account.

860
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,440
And then if you go, say, take a look at Slack, here it's very clear that Slack is actually

861
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,220
being published by the Slack group, who has also been verified by Canonical.

862
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:05,100
And I think that's lessons they learned to try to make that more clear.

863
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:10,600
But I don't know if A, users are even aware to look for that difference, and B, I don't

864
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:14,880
know if it really answers the question of what happens when it's something that needs

865
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,800
like significant trust.

866
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,820
Signal comes to mind, maybe like a Bitcoin wallet or something that you would use to

867
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:26,680
encrypt your files, like something that you want to place a lot of trust into.

868
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,480
Should that be packaged by a third party maintainer?

869
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,160
Or should we only trust it from the original source?

870
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,200
So far in Linux, we've made the trade off and decided, well, the maintainers will do

871
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,200
it.

872
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:40,060
If you look at a traditional distro, none of the packages in there are generally being

873
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:42,680
packaged by the upstream person, typically.

874
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:47,880
For Signal specifically, I've traditionally used their official deb, which seems like

875
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,680
a perfectly fine way to go.

876
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:54,600
But since we had our summer of immutability, I dove a little bit more into Flatpaks, thanks

877
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,160
to both of you.

878
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:01,360
And I kind of ran into that issue, which was trying to discover whether it was an official

879
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,360
or not.

880
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:06,880
And then when I discovered that it wasn't, trying to determine if I should trust these

881
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,320
people or not.

882
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:14,000
And I tend to love open source and everyone involved as a basic default.

883
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,820
But then the question becomes, well, should I?

884
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:23,040
And I found that difficult to discover, because you end up going down a rabbit hole and ending

885
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:28,140
up on the project's GitHub, where there's like three maintainers.

886
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,460
Sometimes there's more than that.

887
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:32,160
But these are still people that I don't know their association.

888
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,540
So it's a funny little pickle we've got there.

889
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:40,920
The nature of this whole problem comes down to a very ugly paradox that we don't like

890
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,920
to talk about.

891
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:48,380
The paradox is, we want all these applications to exist and be available for the medium of

892
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:55,520
delivery that we need or want to use, but nobody cares.

893
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:00,680
Because nobody cares, somebody has to do that work in the first place.

894
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:06,200
And maybe an ISP, because we're going to call them what they are, independent software

895
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,200
vendors.

896
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:12,720
An ISP will pick some mechanism in which they're going to deliver it, whether it's a tarball,

897
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:19,800
an app image, an RPM, a deb, or even just like a self extracting shell script, which

898
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,440
is the most horrifying way to do it.

899
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:27,480
But there you go, they'll pick a method, and it will not be the method you want.

900
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:32,560
And so somebody has to do that transformation from one method to the other.

901
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:37,400
And that is never, ever, ever going to stop.

902
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:42,360
Because there is no incentive for it to stop.

903
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,960
You have tug of wars across all the different dimensions.

904
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:52,240
So you've got people who are gatekeepers of the software centers, who in the various distributions

905
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,960
will pick one format or the other.

906
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:03,400
Even if they could enable both, they won't, for either jealousy or ego or because there's

907
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,680
a technical problem or something like that.

908
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:14,840
And this comes back to a second order of issues that we have, which is that in the open source

909
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:24,860
space, we have this unwritten contract that there are actually two levels of responsibility

910
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:25,860
here.

911
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:29,600
There's the responsibility of the creator of the software, and there's the responsibility

912
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:32,320
of the deliverer of the software.

913
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:40,360
With Flat Hub and Snapcraft, Snap Store, I don't know if they have a name for this, but

914
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:48,200
in those worlds, they're trying to essentially break this contract by saying the person who

915
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:52,520
creates the code should be the one that delivers the code, in theory.

916
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:57,320
But they also know that they don't have the pull to do it, and that this also creates

917
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:03,440
a legal conundrum, because whenever you're delivering software that is not yours, you

918
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,000
are actually taking on legal responsibility and liability.

919
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,480
Again, not a lawyer, can't really, not legal advice, yada, yada, yada.

920
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:17,480
But generally speaking, if you look at how all this stuff works, the moment you take

921
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:22,560
a piece of code, whether it's compiled or not, and you do a transformation to deliver

922
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:27,320
it, you're taking responsibility for that code at some level.

923
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:32,920
And this is why a DMCA takedown by the signal people elicited the response that it did,

924
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:37,580
because at the end of the day, whether Canonical likes to admit it or not, and they definitely

925
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:42,520
don't like to admit to this, they are ultimately publishing every application, and at some

926
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:46,540
level are legally responsible for every application delivered through the Snap Store.

927
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:51,040
This is also true for Flathub, at some level they are responsible for every single thing

928
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,520
that's on there.

929
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:57,960
And if something is wrong, they are the ones in hot water just as much as everyone else,

930
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:00,920
possibly more so because they're complicit.

931
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:05,520
There's a whole lot of things that, like, Linux distributions have historically done

932
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:10,280
quite a lot to avoid that these new age systems don't do.

933
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:15,520
And because of that, we are going to see a lot more of these kinds of things happening

934
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:22,600
as that exposure goes up and the proponents of these systems push it harder and harder.

935
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:28,380
And the end result is going to be, with these new formats, probably what's going to eventually

936
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:31,880
happen is essentially maintainer bankruptcy.

937
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:36,160
If it is not delivered by the creator and it is not an open source solution, it is just

938
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:43,880
going to disappear from all the stores, because the legal risk will go up over time, not down.

939
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:49,360
Because this unwritten contract of, you don't sue me for making your software available,

940
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,560
will be violated over and over and over.

941
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,040
Oh, you should write this down, Neil.

942
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,040
I feel like this would be a good spicy prediction for our predictions episode.

943
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,040
Oh, yeah.

944
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,040
It's going to keep happening.

945
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:04,200
Like, Signal has a long and storied history of really not liking redistribution of their

946
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,200
application.

947
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,120
It doesn't matter what platform it is, if it is redistributed by someone else, they're

948
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,600
going to go after you.

949
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,160
Neil, it's just the lawyers.

950
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,160
Neil, just blame the lawyers.

951
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:18,280
So the lawyers are operating on a directive that exists at the top level that says, this

952
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,680
is a thing we care about.

953
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,680
And you know what?

954
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,120
There's a lot of vendors that are the same way.

955
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,480
Some of them hand wave it away.

956
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,920
Standard practice at certain sizes.

957
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:26,920
Yeah.

958
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,240
So some vendors hand wave this away.

959
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:33,400
I know, for example, that TeamViewer, even though their EULA actually forbids redistribution,

960
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:38,960
they implicitly kind of hand wave it away for Linux people, because they're too small

961
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:39,960
and nobody cares.

962
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:40,960
Yada, yada, yada.

963
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:41,960
Yes!

964
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,240
Sneaking it in.

965
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:49,440
If you actually read the end user license agreements of virtually every proprietary

966
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,000
software package, you're not allowed to do this.

967
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Yeah.

968
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,880
And that is actually a thing we've all blatantly kind of ignored.

969
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,680
Well that's not, you know, shh.

970
00:49:58,680 --> 00:49:59,680
Yeah.

971
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,920
And so like, this is going to keep, this will keep biting us.

972
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:06,240
Ironically, as Linux becomes more popular, it will start biting us more.

973
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:11,560
And so, you know, places like, you know, the infamous third party repos that host non free

974
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:15,960
software in the various Linux distributions, I'm not going to name names, but we all know

975
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:20,880
what they are, and the flat hubs and the snap crafts and all these other things in the world,

976
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,800
they're going to get bitten and burned over and over and over again.

977
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,360
And we're going to see a bankruptcy of those things.

978
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,400
Save it for the prediction show.

979
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,400
That's spicy.

980
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,400
I won't, I won't steal it.

981
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,400
That's good.

982
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,400
You own that one.

983
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,400
I think if you guys will allow it, I think Colonel and I should be these guys just for

984
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:41,160
a moment because not only do I hear the belly aching about Signal getting pulled out of

985
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:45,600
the Snap store, but I also been hearing a lot of belly aching about them dropping SMS

986
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:49,000
support and girl, just use Matrix already, right, Colonel?

987
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,340
Just use Matrix.

988
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:56,360
So one of the things I wanted to say on that is that Matrix is a decentralized program.

989
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:59,060
You have multiple clients that are all compatible.

990
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:02,640
You have a distributed network of servers.

991
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:09,620
There is no one place that it can be taken down, whereas Signal is a centralized proprietary

992
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:17,160
application with one set of servers, one app, and is, in my opinion, hostile to the open

993
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,160
source community.

994
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:24,000
Oh, and I would also say is sort of subjective to one large ego who sort of has a vision,

995
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,960
is very particular about that vision.

996
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:30,800
Moxie Marlin Spike has been very hostile to the open source community, not just Signal,

997
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,400
but also other places as well.

998
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:40,040
There was an application that in F-Droid that they took the Signal mobile code base, used

999
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:47,360
the web hook for the desktop application just so that they could have an Android application

1000
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:51,820
that didn't rely on Google services framework.

1001
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:55,920
They went after them hard and basically shut them down.

1002
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:00,080
And that project was willing to work with Signal, was willing to, you know, what do

1003
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,220
we have to do to make this okay with you?

1004
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:08,000
And at the end of the day, Moxie, through GitHub comments and whatnot, it's still all

1005
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
out there.

1006
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,280
You can go find it.

1007
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:16,560
He shut them down and said, no, this is basically, he said, it's my project, you'll do it my

1008
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,400
way, and I don't want you.

1009
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,400
That's the thing.

1010
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:25,480
And before we completely move off the matrix thing, I'll just say, not all matrix is element.

1011
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:30,300
Fluffy chat is very much a Telegram-like experience or Signal-like experience, because I'd say

1012
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,720
Signal is even simpler than Telegram.

1013
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:36,800
Fluffy chat is very clean, it's cross-platform, it's GPL3.

1014
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:42,300
And it takes the complexity of matrix and it puts it behind a UI simpler than Telegram.

1015
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:47,000
And if you're on iOS specifically, there's Neo, N-I-O, which has been built with Swift

1016
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,240
UI from scratch using all of the iOS design languages.

1017
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:56,040
This is MPL, it's also open source, and it gives a very clean, very minimal messaging

1018
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,040
experience.

1019
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,480
It's all matrix underneath it.

1020
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,040
And the reason why that's powerful is because you could be sitting back with a big old full

1021
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:06,480
scale element client, or you could be on Android with a totally different client, but you can

1022
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,000
still communicate.

1023
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,260
And they can't pull any one client and they can't pull any one server.

1024
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:16,320
And so it's not just element when we mean matrix, when we talk matrix, it can be these

1025
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,840
more purpose-built clients too.

1026
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:26,280
And if you go to matrix.org slash clients, you can see a surprisingly big list of different

1027
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:31,040
clients for different platforms from mobile to desktop to the web.

1028
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,240
So matrix.org slash clients for that.

1029
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:40,440
You know, had you presented matrix as an option to replace something like signal maybe a year

1030
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:45,440
ago, eight months ago, I would have said, no way, it's not even close to being usable.

1031
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,680
But these days I'm changing my mind on that.

1032
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,160
It's actually been really nice.

1033
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,280
So I think you guys are onto something here.

1034
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:56,760
Yeah, it's harder when you already have a whole social group on a particular service.

1035
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,480
You know, I get it.

1036
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:59,840
Sometimes people move quick though.

1037
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:03,040
Sometimes something comes up and people, they just jump ship.

1038
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,000
So when that moment, when that opportunity comes up, be ready.

1039
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,520
I also have two, let's call them notes because you guys are all friends here.

1040
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:14,200
As far as I understand the signal desktop is a GPL v3.

1041
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,280
So it is open source.

1042
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:20,480
And so the backend service, I don't believe is, maybe that's the distinction.

1043
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:25,540
And I'm pretty sure from what I've been reading that Moxie is not with signal anymore.

1044
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:27,000
So maybe that's a good thing.

1045
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:33,280
So Moxie is not with signal and yes, the client is a Faro GPL, but rebuilds that are not officially

1046
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,740
blessed by signal will not be allowed to connect to the signal server.

1047
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:40,520
So it doesn't matter.

1048
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,940
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

1049
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:44,640
Go try it for free as an individual.

1050
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:48,920
Or if you're a team, maybe you're in an enterprise, you can get a free trial when you go to bitwarden.com

1051
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:49,920
slash Linux.

1052
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:50,920
Straight up.

1053
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:51,920
I have to be honest with you.

1054
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:52,920
I have tried them all.

1055
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:57,720
And Bitwarden I have found to be the best and easiest way to store, share and sync your

1056
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,040
sensitive data.

1057
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,560
And I love that Bitwarden is open source.

1058
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:07,880
It's trusted by millions of individuals, teams, open source projects, organizations and more

1059
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,760
for all their secure passwords, storage.

1060
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:14,040
And when you do have to share that stuff, also Bitwarden helps you there too.

1061
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:17,480
In fact, it's really the only way you can feel safe kind of moving that sort of stuff

1062
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,960
around the internet between individuals.

1063
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,640
You don't want to write it down on a sticky note.

1064
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,080
Wes and I have been using it personally for years.

1065
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,960
I think Wes longer than I have.

1066
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,300
And Bitwarden has been rolling out great features like account switching in the mobile app or

1067
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:35,440
fast mail and DuckDuckGo integration so you can use a unique email address with every

1068
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:41,040
site or service or app that you're signing up with as well as a secure password, as well

1069
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,040
as a unique username.

1070
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,400
I mean, that's really, you can just layer on the security there.

1071
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,760
And I noticed Bitwarden just recently posted a great tutorial.

1072
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,960
So I always like to keep my eye on the stuff for you guys because, you know, why not leverage

1073
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:57,680
this and just get even more, I guess, secure because they have Bitwarden CLI, of course.

1074
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:58,880
Yeah, that's right.

1075
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:03,720
They have a command line version of Bitwarden and you can use this and pop in your passwords

1076
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:08,100
in your shell when you need to like log into something on the command line.

1077
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:12,360
You can leverage Bitwarden CLI and shell functions to create simple workflows that just allow

1078
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:17,320
you to unlock your secrets into environment variables whenever you need without requiring

1079
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:20,440
you to hard code your secrets into your dot files.

1080
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:21,440
How nice is that?

1081
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,560
Especially if you want to move them around between machines.

1082
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:28,800
So Bitwarden CLI could be a really great tool for your tool chest.

1083
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:29,800
Is that the phrase?

1084
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:32,300
I'll put a link to the guide in the show notes so you can check it out and see if it'll work

1085
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:33,300
for you.

1086
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:37,480
But go over to bitwarden.com slash Linux to support the show or send it to somebody you

1087
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,360
know that could use better password management.

1088
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:45,560
Maybe a friend, a family member, place of work, open source project, you know they're

1089
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:46,560
out there.

1090
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:49,360
Send them to bitwarden.com slash Linux.

1091
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:52,640
It'll be worth their time and you know it's the best way for them to stay secure online

1092
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:53,640
too.

1093
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:59,120
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

1094
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:02,920
All right Mr. Payne, so what would you like to share with the class this week?

1095
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:09,520
Yeah, I just wanted to send a little love to Godot, the cross-platform free and open

1096
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,000
source game engine.

1097
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,920
It's MIT, don't you know, launched in January 2014.

1098
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:19,480
And it's one of those really special projects I think because you know in the game making

1099
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:24,640
ecosystem there's just not that many great tools that I mean you might be able to get

1100
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:28,640
it for free or use it but that's you know some student or creator license or you know

1101
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,720
if you make any serious money they're going to want to cut or you're going to spend a

1102
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:34,360
whole bunch of money on all these assets through their system.

1103
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,360
They don't do any of that?

1104
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,360
No, no.

1105
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:42,880
They're trying to make a project that has a big set of common tools so you can just

1106
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:47,400
focus on making your game you don't have to like you know shell out and use a whole bunch

1107
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:51,360
of go find all the top leading industry applications that you're going to need to do your audio

1108
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:54,880
stuff and to go make your graphics and of course you can do that and import stuff if

1109
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:55,880
you want.

1110
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:59,000
But Godot's trying to make like a friendly you know you're learning about how to get

1111
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
into games.

1112
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,760
I mean you can use it for serious games too but with a holistic approach that lets you

1113
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,840
really have everything you need under one roof.

1114
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:09,960
Looks like they just had a brand new beta release just a couple days ago too.

1115
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:14,360
Yeah 3.5 came out in August which was really nice and they're working on a 4.0 they're

1116
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:18,680
in the beta steps right now and that that's got some well that's got a lot of promising

1117
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:24,480
stuff and you know you can you can export native Linux games just you know right from

1118
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,760
Godot so they're platform friendly for us you can target Android you can target Web

1119
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,840
Assembly it runs on Linux as well as of course you know a bunch of other platforms you can

1120
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:36,000
compile it for BSD if you want to or run it on Windows or Mac.

1121
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Yeah there's even a web editor.

1122
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,800
If you want to go crazy there's a web editor.

1123
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:44,560
It's interesting you bring this up because okay so they just released a new beta a couple

1124
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:48,560
of days ago and then a couple of days before that they moved to a new foundation.

1125
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:49,560
They did yeah.

1126
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:53,000
Okay so as I mentioned they started way back in 2014 you know just a couple of people who

1127
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:59,840
were trying to pack together a game engine in 2015 they joined the SFC and SFC provided

1128
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:04,040
them you know a foundation structure a way to sort of take donations from projects because

1129
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,760
you know they'll sometimes get sponsorships from game studios or you know various other

1130
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:10,880
players in the industry and you need legal frameworks you need processes you need accountants

1131
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:15,300
who can help you like do those things and it's but it's been you know I think both parties

1132
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:19,480
have been really happy with it it's maybe a good example of what the SFC can do for

1133
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:22,920
open source projects is you know let them start to hire people part-time eventually

1134
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:28,680
start to hire people and support them full time to work on Godot but at this point you

1135
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:32,600
know Godot has really taken off it's grown a lot and so they're launching their own foundation

1136
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:38,380
now and they're they're pitching this as it's a it's a graduation from the SFC to launch

1137
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:43,480
their own foundation they're trying to take a lot off of how blender does it I think we've

1138
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:47,040
all been pretty pleased you know I don't know that they're perfect but as far as foundations

1139
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:50,800
go it seems like blenders got a good a good foundation in order so that gives me some

1140
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:55,720
hope that you know they are part of this is does seem to be that they want to mix up the

1141
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:59,600
different approaches that they can have you know maybe tailor some things to a thing that

1142
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:03,640
would make sense for Godot that didn't make sense for all the projects under the SFC umbrella

1143
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:07,040
so they're thinking maybe they're going to have crowdfunding campaigns like like blender

1144
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:10,660
or Krita do they're talking about maybe setting up something that lets users start to sell

1145
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:15,440
assets for an asset library and integrate that in maybe sell merchandise or you know

1146
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:19,400
just get a little more flexibility with sponsoring events or having events how might you fund

1147
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:24,200
that or try to get fly people in to be there so there's a lot going on and it's just it's

1148
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:28,680
really easy to get started with they've got a python like scripting language like Godot

1149
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:33,040
script that's built in oh okay you can also use c-sharp if you already know c-sharp so

1150
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,720
that's that's supported right out of the box I think you can even use c++ or rust or you

1151
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:42,040
know there's some like community supported versions too yeah yeah you can use rust with

1152
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:50,680
it okay that sounds like a really cool pic or it's not a pic but I guess it's a it's

1153
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:54,200
a cool subject to bring to the class I guess but I'm curious why it's on your radar are

1154
01:00:54,200 --> 01:01:00,680
you are you fooling around with making a game I've dabbled a little bit yeah well so it's

1155
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:05,440
actually I've been trying to help my brother is very creative in this aspect and he you

1156
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:08,820
know he's he's a big gamer he likes these things plays D&D and you know isn't just sort

1157
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:13,960
of crafting all the different aspects of a game and so I've been trying to help him he's

1158
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:18,300
learning some and that's been a fun adventure for me to sort of sit alongside and as he's

1159
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:22,200
learning the technical side and I'm trying to support him there and fun this path of

1160
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:27,880
Godot yeah he found it Godot Godot he actually found it first I'd heard of it you know I'd

1161
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:31,600
followed it and looked at the looked at the news but it was so neat because you know he's

1162
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:35,760
got I do I did give him a Linux laptop a couple years ago that he does use but he's using

1163
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:39,320
it on his main sort of Windows gaming PC but it didn't matter like I could just load his

1164
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:43,800
project in and make some updates like oh maybe try doing it this way and share it back with

1165
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:48,120
him and he could load it up on Windows no problem so that's powerful yeah it's been

1166
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:52,280
it's been a really nice fun and now I'm an expert I haven't made any fancy games yet

1167
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:56,080
or anything but there's a lot of tutorials out there there's a strong community on on

1168
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:59,800
YouTube of creators who are you know sharing you walking you through except got example

1169
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:04,840
project files you can download so it seems super accessible before today I was aware

1170
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:11,880
of it but I think in the back of my mind I thought it was like like using go for creating

1171
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:16,240
games mm-hmm I didn't really would be a good name for it that's why I thought it was Godot

1172
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:20,080
the Godot and I think in the past they were had a little more limited scope it seemed

1173
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:24,360
like maybe it was better focused on like 2d games and stuff but these days they've got

1174
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:28,680
you know rich 3d capabilities you can make VR applications if you want you can publish

1175
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:32,600
to WebAssembly you can publish for all the mobile platforms like it seems like you know

1176
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:36,440
if you're not a professional you're trying to just learn or explore you could go a long

1177
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:39,280
way with Godot before it was gonna be your limitation you know what I like about their

1178
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:43,680
website seeing a lot of tux the penguin mm-hmm and I'm seeing a lot of open source stuff

1179
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:49,520
on here I'm seeing the open source logo seeing open source listed as one of their main features

1180
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:54,800
great that is really slick well thanks for telling us about that mm-hmm so I wanted to

1181
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:58,520
share with you guys a little thing a little trend that I've noticed and I know some of

1182
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:01,800
our community members have because I've seen it getting discussed in our matrix kind of

1183
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:08,260
recently and that is since Elon's announcement that he's taking over Twitter you know that

1184
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:15,560
rough timeline we are seeing reports of just massive user gains for Mastodon 70,000 users

1185
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:20,020
joining in the last couple of weeks is one of the numbers I've seen going around I know

1186
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:24,320
I've heard it on some you know NPR type segments other news coverage people it doesn't get

1187
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:33,140
a lot of play but its name is thrown out there CNN CNN headline from CNN updated yesterday

1188
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:39,280
with Twitter in chaos Mastodon is on fire this is from your CNN news here and this is

1189
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:43,240
the bit this is the bit that I noticed that I thought was pretty interesting they say

1190
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:47,480
the service speaking about Mastodon the service has a similar look to Twitter with a timeline

1191
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:52,700
of short updates sorted chronologically rather than algorithmically it lets users join a

1192
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:58,480
slew of different servers run by various groups and individuals rather than one central platform

1193
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:03,320
controlled by a single company like Twitter Instagram or Facebook now isn't that interesting

1194
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:07,780
that that is one of the things they decided to kind of emphasize to the audience there

1195
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:14,260
it's decentralized nature and I I don't think that you know Twitter's dead and Mastodon's

1196
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:20,200
gonna take over anything like that but I find it interesting and I'm curious to know what

1197
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:27,400
you think about these open source projects that build and build and build for years and

1198
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:31,680
years and we know about them we hear about them and they kind of hover and they and they

1199
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:35,920
have some users and we kind of keep them alive as the enthusiasts and we kind of use them

1200
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:40,600
a little bit but then every now and then something breaks in the world and the normals hear about

1201
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:44,280
one of these things has been around for years and they rush in and all of a sudden a project

1202
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:49,080
just has tens of thousands of more users and there's tons more instances going along it's

1203
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:53,880
a fascinating phenomena what do you attribute that to that it's like just wasn't good enough

1204
01:04:53,880 --> 01:05:00,000
to replace the main thing until well you know you've got that you've got the network effect

1205
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,120
you know what do you need it what do you need a harder to figure it out harder to set up

1206
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:07,220
you got to make some choices to pick your instance sort of system if you you know you're

1207
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:14,600
already on the functionally the one instance everyone cares about I wondered is uh is the

1208
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:19,200
poll hitting do you guys feel like it's time to join the mastodon or get on get on a mastodon

1209
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:22,640
if you're not I am curious again you know I've never I don't know that I've ever actually

1210
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:27,760
set it up I have you know followed it for a while but yeah what about you Brent Lee

1211
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:32,320
are you getting the mastodon urge at all well the first time I got curious was when I was

1212
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:36,560
in Alan Jude's basement doing a brunch with him and he said hey are you a Fediverse guy

1213
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:43,320
and uh so I looked into it a little bit um but these days I feel like it's almost irresponsible

1214
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:49,660
not to at least check it out a little bit I was just not interested in any more social

1215
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:56,280
media like telegram twitter matrix several others that I can't think of off the top of

1216
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:59,400
my head those are sufficient for me I didn't really want to add another one so I just sort

1217
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:06,480
of said no then when the podcasting 2.0 stuff came along and they had a mastodon to just

1218
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:10,720
talk about podcasting 2.0 it all of a sudden made a ton of sense because it was like a

1219
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:16,880
niche category they're talking about app development namespace development they're you know hashing

1220
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:21,120
out what the new standards should be for things and it's like people discussing podcasting

1221
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:25,920
you know something like okay I'll join that that makes a ton of sense so I do have a mastodon

1222
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:30,340
account but it's on a very specific instance and you're not really using the sort of federation

1223
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:36,120
aspect no am I missing something because I love the matrix federated aspect but matrix

1224
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:40,520
seems to really fill this this hole for me but I wonder if it is the time to have like

1225
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:45,500
is it is it time to have a JB mastodon or should I just be joining somebody else's mastodon

1226
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:50,160
what is the protocol there are mastodon servers a pain in the butt to run I know you looked

1227
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:53,880
a little bit into setting it up didn't seem that hard I mean there's some you know official

1228
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:58,120
containers out there and such this is exactly the conversation we had around matrix and

1229
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:04,000
what is the size of that box running these days okay fair we did it's on like a 48 core

1230
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:09,460
rig now yeah we also made some mistakes that maybe we've learned from yeah we have to find

1231
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:15,840
out you kind of want to set one up don't you what is wrong with you what is wrong with

1232
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:20,320
you I mean I kind of be down I suppose what's the point of having a system you can run yourself

1233
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:24,600
if you don't at least try but then what happens if I already have an account I have an account

1234
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:28,840
on mastodon I believe there's a way to migrate I don't know I don't know how easy that is

1235
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:32,440
and then also I know like the peer tube instance is a sense is also part of that federation

1236
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:37,840
it's very confusing to me if you've created an a mastodon presence on one home server

1237
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:44,560
and decide you want to migrate to another there's in in pretty much every mastodon I

1238
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:50,280
should say every activity pub Twitter clone like implementation so that's basically what

1239
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:58,600
this is yeah in their account UI you can transfer your your account to another to another account

1240
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:03,200
that you have created and it'll basically create a forwarding address and so all of

1241
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:08,640
your followers will move in theory all of your followings will move it'll create a continuity

1242
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:14,560
between your posts all that other fun stuff so picking one is not a forever choice if

1243
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:18,640
you don't like your home server at some point in the future you can jump ship if your home

1244
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:21,880
server is now broken and you want it and you need to move somewhere else you can do that

1245
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:27,600
too so would it be weird see I think what we probably should have done with matrix is

1246
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:32,640
we should have set up matrix and just left it to the JB people and then everybody else

1247
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:36,120
uses matrix.org to create their account and join our server that was one of the mistakes

1248
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:40,200
I was thinking about earlier that's what the tux digital folks did with their system was

1249
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:44,840
they didn't they only allowed people to create accounts on the tux digital server when they

1250
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:52,120
were creators of the network so I wonder is the solution with mastodon to do the same

1251
01:08:52,120 --> 01:09:01,580
it's more scalable that way because like matrix mastodons underlying system works off of synchronizing

1252
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:07,360
events via a pub sub mechanism activity pub and matrix behave very similarly even though

1253
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:12,260
they're different standards and so you have the same kind of resource constraints and

1254
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:17,720
performance constraints so yeah you probably want to create a lockdown mastodon server

1255
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:22,520
that only y'all are using and then everyone else just kind of connects with you through

1256
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:26,720
their own I mean part of the whole federated benefits right I mean just have our own and

1257
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:31,280
then connect out to all our friends but the important part is to make sure that your your

1258
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:35,880
server is discoverable right like if it's not then all of that doesn't matter what I

1259
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:39,760
like about it is it's sort of like it's our own form of verification because we'd have

1260
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:44,320
an at Jupiter broadcasting.com domain it's like you'd know it really is us and you know

1261
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:47,200
we don't have to have any blue checkmark that's eight bucks a month it's just we have our

1262
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:54,000
own domain name I like it I think one question I would have is what can it provide that our

1263
01:09:54,000 --> 01:10:00,120
matrix instance and use of it for the last six plus months wouldn't provide well I suppose

1264
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:05,880
there's people that are on the mastodon fediverse that aren't in matrix you could follow them

1265
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:11,080
there is an argument for matrix to be used for real-time discussion and something else

1266
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:16,440
to be used for more longer term stuff that people can post and come back to at all different

1267
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:21,460
hours and review in a feed on their own schedule right I mean because one I mean I suppose

1268
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:24,840
like that the Twitter style things are used for different purposes by different groups

1269
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:29,640
and all that but one of them is a sort of like broadcasty or musing or you know whatever

1270
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:33,600
jokes things that you wouldn't really put necessarily in like a public channel unless

1271
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:38,240
you were very social about it the more we talk about it the less I want to do it I really

1272
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:44,080
do it's just I hate social media so much but then I remember like except for this is selecting

1273
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:47,840
for very high quality signal like the open source community the free software community

1274
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:52,320
and in particular the JB audience which this would skew towards is higher than average

1275
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:56,240
signal so then it does make it more worth it again and so here's the thing to think

1276
01:10:56,240 --> 01:11:02,920
about right so activity pub the underlying protocol that what we call mastodon where

1277
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:09,480
some would use called pluroma or some of these other ones right that underlying protocol

1278
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:15,520
is not just used for Twitterati style messaging it's also used for things like blogging so

1279
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:24,240
I believe what's it right freely is an activity pub based blog platform and there are a few

1280
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:31,080
others out there and basically one thing you can do is to combine long form and short form

1281
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:38,080
in such a way that somewhat you would post on on a system attached through activity pub

1282
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:43,000
and someone could comment on it through this and then you wind up having this federated

1283
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:51,240
mechanism of connecting these two so having and and again this same address can exist

1284
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:56,900
in different solutions at the same time because again the activity pub publishing address

1285
01:11:56,900 --> 01:12:02,920
is what matters here so for example Chris last at Jupiter at Chris last at Jupiter broadcasting

1286
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:07,560
.com I really hate the scheme that they picked correctly yeah it's really done but all right

1287
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:13,780
put that aside that address could be both a blogging platform where you are writing

1288
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:18,840
about or blogging or whatever because peer tube is also activity pub oriented right and

1289
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:23,740
all these things connect and as you're using a singular identity to publish as everyone

1290
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:28,400
else can see them and they can reply to them which turn into comments and visible feeds

1291
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:34,760
and things of that nature and then you wind up having this interconnected relationship

1292
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:38,960
and this goes for like pixel fed as well right the the federated image hosting thing that

1293
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:42,800
also operates on activity pub and I've noticed that a little bit I've already noticed some

1294
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:47,720
activity pub cross publishing with peer tube and that is pretty powerful activity pub is

1295
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:52,040
designed for multiple forms of transmission from a single identity whereas the matrix

1296
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:59,440
protocol is designed for real-time communication or at least a facsimile of it across across

1297
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:03,680
a single identity across different servers and things like that with a single identity

1298
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:08,440
so the idea is with activity pub you take these disparate services and you connect them

1299
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:14,360
to a unified identity and different types of content are published with that identity

1300
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:19,540
and everything weaves together and clients that respect these different types of events

1301
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:25,600
process them correctly so if you're looking at a federated blog viewer or if you're looking

1302
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:34,600
at a Twitterati style client or if you're looking at you know a photo gallery Pinterest

1303
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:39,800
style thing or whatever right the idea of activity pub is that you have a coherent singular

1304
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:44,600
identity that can have all these multiple forms of content and then the clients will

1305
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:49,800
interpret that and do what you will with it whereas with matrix you're just talking about

1306
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:53,280
you know you have a dedicated purpose these features are being built around a particular

1307
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:59,160
single method of communication and you're supporting that mechanism with its clients

1308
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:03,160
and servers so that's where the core difference is like yeah that's a good distinction to

1309
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:08,040
make you're not going to see matrix do like image galleries I mean technically I suppose

1310
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:12,400
you could do that but like nobody's like going out there and doing that whereas activity

1311
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:16,040
pub that's a very real thing you would do all right so let me know everyone out there

1312
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:21,560
what your thoughts are on if you're feeling the pull towards Mastodon I would go if there's

1313
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:25,440
enough audience there I think it'd be something I consider like to hear your thoughts on it

1314
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:34,240
MJVC wrote in just wanted to report that I've been successfully using NixOS on the Steam

1315
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:39,440
Deck as a desktop replacement dual booting SteamOS and NixOS gives me the best of both

1316
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:43,900
worlds there are a few hiccups with the touch screen but aside from that it works pretty

1317
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:50,560
flawlessly that is really cool on the Steam Deck oh man I replied very quickly saying

1318
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:55,000
tell us how we want to do this so we might have an update coming soon and I wonder is

1319
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:59,600
it plasma or are you using GNOME tell me tell me tell me good question I think this is more

1320
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:04,200
of a teaser than a you know full description so I'm gonna wait for the update and we'll

1321
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:10,520
come back on that five also wrote in about NixOS surprise surprise I have an idea you

1322
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:17,200
keep saying Chris that you don't want to pollute Linux unplugged with too much NixOS well we

1323
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:22,680
did it again this week didn't we well I agree I think NixOS is so vast that maybe you can

1324
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:30,880
start NixOS unplugged that's what we need we need another show just what you asked for

1325
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:36,280
what we'll do is we'll just geek out and then we'll just surface the best of we'll condense

1326
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:40,920
it down and just really bring you the nuggets from time to time right is that what our that

1327
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:47,820
you like that plan is that so I think so all right let's go with that and now it is time

1328
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:53,560
for the boost so the first boost we're gonna get to this week is actually follow up on

1329
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:58,160
a boost that was sent in from Neve a couple of weeks ago who offered to send us an arc

1330
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:04,640
GPU from Intel incredibly generous so we wrote back and said no but we'll borrow it for a

1331
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:13,600
little bit and guess what it's right it's here we have it right here it showed up the

1332
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:20,760
ASRock Challenger ITX Intel arc a380 I'm gonna open her up here there's there's actually

1333
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:25,600
a pie in the box I actually have not opened it so if there is or a bomb we're gonna stream

1334
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:31,320
it live we will find out I would be not what I want but not like totally disappointing

1335
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:35,340
I think that might be our version of a rickroll at this point I don't know there's a there's

1336
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:38,640
an envelope in here you know I feel like we should do the Johnny Carson thing so we'll

1337
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:44,160
read the tracks oh here it is this week died doing what we love now if you're the best

1338
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:49,920
aka Josh the best look at this look at this beautiful card oh there's a there's a thumb

1339
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:56,240
drive in here okay what you know better than to put it strange thumb trap there's a thumb

1340
01:16:56,240 --> 01:17:01,920
drive I wouldn't that be fun tempting well maybe we'll find out in the members feed we'll

1341
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:06,960
figure out what's in the thumb drive but yeah this check it out Wes that's a compact little

1342
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:13,040
card the a380 is doesn't look bad though and I imagine our or I think our Thalia order

1343
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:17,160
is gonna go in Monday morning I've been dragging I've been so busy I haven't got around to

1344
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:21,360
it that's how you was you want to savor that click you know when you actually hit the order

1345
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:26,080
to you I mean the right state of mind glass of champagne in hand I I've come I think with

1346
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:30,280
a really reasonable build I think it's a very reasonable build of the Thalia and I'll share

1347
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:36,960
it when we get it but that's going in there okay take it out let's pull it out let's pull

1348
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:43,560
it out oh yeah yeah that is beautiful Intel thank you thank you for making this Intel

1349
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:47,680
finally look at the fan on that thing hold that up a little bit there West so we can

1350
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:51,920
look at it yeah look at that thing it's got a almost like a hundred almost probably not

1351
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:56,600
quite as big as a hundred and twenty millimeter fan on the top of it yeah but one big fan

1352
01:17:56,600 --> 01:18:00,680
so hopefully me there we go yeah it really moves good job Wes you got it you gotta do

1353
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:05,440
a fan test that's gotta do a fan test leader of the mind Wes blows across the fan to prove

1354
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:10,140
to the listener it's really there we got one HDMI three display ports here nice little

1355
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:14,880
plugs it ships with I mean it's not quite that it's almost half the length of a new

1356
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:21,360
Nvidia card it's not quite but it is stout it's wide and stout it's nice so we'll throw

1357
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:25,600
that in the new Thalia and through throw it through its paces and hopefully we'll see

1358
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:31,100
hopefully get OBS going with that is it up to the challenge will it meet our needs it's

1359
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:37,280
not ready yet OBS I think just is I saw the pull request go in to turn on quicksync video

1360
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:45,120
stuff for for free codecs and support for the new generation of the Intel arc stuff

1361
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:50,080
like like the last week so I don't I don't think that that's a thing for a little while

1362
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:55,920
building OBS from source again we're back here yep also just a couple days ago Michael

1363
01:18:55,920 --> 01:19:01,960
Arbrol reported that you need an Intel ME enabled system to update the GSC firmware

1364
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:07,680
on the arc right now so that means a it's got to be an Intel system to even update the

1365
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:11,560
firmware and be you need Intel ME enabled which I don't know what that means for the

1366
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:18,280
Thalia but since we're only borrowing it it's not the end of the world for us but it's something

1367
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:24,840
weird clearly clearly a new product but that's okay yeah on system 76 machines the management

1368
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:30,840
engine is turned off so that's gonna be a problem yeah well I mean like I said if I

1369
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:35,800
was gonna if I was buying this forever's yes but since we just want to test it and we're

1370
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:39,600
willing to do a little bit of the grunt work to make that work I don't actually know if

1371
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:43,800
the system 76 things give you the ability to turn it on you should tell us when you

1372
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:47,840
get the paleo whether they give you an option to turn it back on yeah well I'll also try

1373
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:51,760
a firmware update if there is one just to see what happens hopefully I don't think it

1374
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:58,880
would break it right all right now Chris do you know how long you have this for is there

1375
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:04,080
like a loaner expiry date have you come to some agreement there um so basically in and

1376
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:09,040
you know until I were done I guess you didn't really say I don't intend to keep it too long

1377
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:12,840
you know a few years you know no big deal you know just just a few years it sounds great

1378
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:18,360
okay update I guess Intel reached out to say that firmware updating will work on AMD platforms

1379
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:21,800
I just don't think all the details of like what weird app you have to run or how exactly

1380
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:27,880
that will work okay so it will work well the good news it's only 120 ish dollars so you

1381
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:33,120
know if Chris breaks it he can afford to pay the guy back we'll take it out of Brent sets

1382
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:40,960
all right night 62 boosted in with 40 96 sats this is my first boost I use the blue wallet

1383
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:45,160
I'll be combination so blue wallet to get the sats and then I'll be as the lightning

1384
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:49,800
wallet the idea of setting up my own lightning node seems very appealing but I found that

1385
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:53,960
the setup is actually working really easy I loving that I can just give some value this

1386
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:59,060
way now here's a question about Nix OS versus ansible on other distros can you go deeper

1387
01:20:59,060 --> 01:21:03,740
into what makes Nix so much better in your opinion couldn't a well-documented ansible

1388
01:21:03,740 --> 01:21:08,820
setup do most of the same things I'd also love to hear more about the next package manager

1389
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:13,200
on other distros does this replace ansible it's a great question because we get this

1390
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:16,720
one a lot and I don't think the position of the show is one is better than the other to

1391
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:23,640
make that clear and ansible is obviously gonna support a lot wider range a combination of

1392
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:30,160
devices services hardware distributions software in general and we use ansible here so it's

1393
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:36,040
not like we're anti ansible I think what I explained earlier today with the setup I was

1394
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:41,680
doing where I you know just took a config file off my laptop and dropped it on my Odroid

1395
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:47,800
very different systems very different hardware and I just rebuilt and I had a fully functional

1396
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:52,640
system without having all of the overhead of also having ansible and having to understand

1397
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:58,280
how to write a playbook and manage all of that it's just basically some yaml and you

1398
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:03,680
can almost always find an example and it's there's a simplicity if you're only using

1399
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:07,920
Nix it doesn't really work so great outside of that you could use the Nix package manager

1400
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:12,560
just about anything but yeah I like I use it on my work Mac love it yeah they're super

1401
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:16,880
super helpful yeah I think it's better than brew in most cases so I think the other part

1402
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:20,760
too is you're right like ansible super flexible you can you know use it all kinds of different

1403
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:24,240
places it's trying to solve problems that Nix is not primarily targeted at there's a

1404
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:28,760
lot of differences because ansible is a big tool and Nix also is a big tool then especially

1405
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:33,640
between Nix and Nix OS but the other part is I think for you at least from what we've

1406
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:37,960
talked about kind of wanted to get away from those other distros right like okay if I if

1407
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:41,040
I use ansible I might not have to think about as much because I wrote that playbook in itself

1408
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:44,960
but like you're still using apt under the hood or things like that like Nix is a much

1409
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:50,560
more holistic for the things it works for you've got this package and system that all

1410
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:55,840
feels tightly together and lean and mean and not just sort of bolted on top to try to pack

1411
01:22:55,840 --> 01:23:00,800
paper over some of the limitations of the base system yeah I think you nailed it and

1412
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:07,620
you and I both just trend towards a preference for very simple servers minimum viable server

1413
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:13,040
nothing more than it needs to be and and then because you and I apparently are masochists

1414
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:18,120
when we can we also make them rolling because if you keep it simple and you appropriately

1415
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:22,360
separate applications and data and you've got good backups and snapshots I actually

1416
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:27,080
think the best experience in Linux is a very modern system I wouldn't say cutting edge

1417
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:31,980
because there's some stuff in Nix it isn't super cutting edge but and that that all has

1418
01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:36,840
worked really well without having all of the ansible overhead so yes you put it very well

1419
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:45,480
well our next boost comes from Caspeeland with 3690 sats b-o-o-s-t just a simple message

1420
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:50,040
but this time I hope the boost in streaming sets will help you podcasters good to see

1421
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:55,840
you again costs mm-hmm thank you very much ah another favorite of ours wait all boosters

1422
01:23:55,840 --> 01:24:08,380
are our favorites but it's rusta casta versa boosted in with 1000 sets and calling out

1423
01:24:08,380 --> 01:24:13,820
something that I think we all noticed and appreciated big mumble room energy on the

1424
01:24:13,820 --> 01:24:19,680
intro last week yeah so hey thanks mumble room it was really painful not to be here

1425
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:25,040
last week and having that strong intro knowing that you were here to support Chris that that

1426
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:29,280
helped a lot I was yeah also a big shout out to Neil in there specifically in the whole

1427
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:32,800
mumble room was just great I think they had my back you know because you guys are both

1428
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:36,940
out Brent on his secret mission to moose hunt and you with the sick and so to have them

1429
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:40,960
just there with my back was great but the funny thing was is literally everybody internally

1430
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:46,800
on our internal chat like that was the first comment that mumble intro energy yeah totally

1431
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:52,640
killed it it was great so thank you very much I will say we also did get some feedback specifically

1432
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:57,960
saying that Neil was very much enjoyed last episode so thanks Neil for for filling in

1433
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:05,920
for us well I don't know how to take that I guess thanks I don't know I don't know how

1434
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:14,560
to answer that he's blushing tater boosts in with 2050 sets tater says coming in hot

1435
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:19,240
with the boost we love that one that's my favorite I feel like tater took my advice

1436
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:24,760
I said you don't have to write us something profound to kick off a huge discussion just

1437
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:29,120
send us the boost for support because we love those thank you very much tater well nor

1438
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:35,580
Kyle geek wrote something profound hello nor cocky with 8080 sets you're doing a good job

1439
01:25:35,580 --> 01:25:40,180
hey I know I'm a few weeks behind but I wanted to put in my two cents on the butter fs discussion

1440
01:25:40,180 --> 01:25:44,200
I mean we're always talking about butter fs so I think you're right on time I'm currently

1441
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:50,420
using open Sousa micro OS desktop as my daily driver micro s is an immutable OS which uses

1442
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:56,020
butter fs snapshots instead of OS tree like silver blue does for me it's been a rock solid

1443
01:25:56,020 --> 01:26:02,380
the updates apply every time and I haven't had to break or roll back yet that's a W for

1444
01:26:02,380 --> 01:26:08,340
butter fs to me I agree and I think open Sousa too and one of the things that they point

1445
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:12,220
out here is they're using it as the desktop daily driver and to have that kind of rock

1446
01:26:12,220 --> 01:26:18,780
solid performance that is a win that is super nice we spent a period of time between distros

1447
01:26:18,780 --> 01:26:22,740
we spent some time with open Sousa and I played with the immutable version for a little bit

1448
01:26:22,740 --> 01:26:26,620
on a cm4 and we set up a jellyfin server on it and we all kind of added a bunch of different

1449
01:26:26,620 --> 01:26:35,020
stuff to it and I was really impressed I really was again there's a lot of OS there and we're

1450
01:26:35,020 --> 01:26:40,740
more of a minimum viable OS type guys but it's a great OS it is that yeah I think it

1451
01:26:40,740 --> 01:26:45,420
could be you know it seemed very administratable you know designed with that kind of in mind

1452
01:26:45,420 --> 01:26:50,620
which can appreciate when things when things go wrong user 720 also wrote in with a hundred

1453
01:26:50,620 --> 01:26:58,780
cents gif gif let's hold a boost ballot here's a hundred sats on gif wow then gif is winning

1454
01:26:58,780 --> 01:27:06,060
right now we'll find out next yeah that's it right there right I guess okay who are

1455
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:11,140
we to stand in the way pull over yeah so far gifts the winner maybe it only takes a hundred

1456
01:27:11,140 --> 01:27:21,420
sets maybe it's settled maybe it's not JPC also boosted in with 22,222 sets love the

1457
01:27:21,420 --> 01:27:27,540
show by the way I'm using boost CLI just like that awesome it's the new by the way I use

1458
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:32,700
arch right they kind of well it is more technical than setting up arch yeah maybe you want to

1459
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:38,700
set it up by about a mile I am so impressed JPC thank you also for the for the generous

1460
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:45,460
but yeah but also boost CLI is a serious badge of honor you have mastered multiple layers

1461
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:51,740
of the stack and you are very impressive thank you for the boost I I haven't even got that

1462
01:27:51,740 --> 01:27:55,460
working yet and I've been playing around with Bitcoin for 13 years and I haven't even gotten

1463
01:27:55,460 --> 01:28:00,660
that working yet so give me a break all right maybe maybe 11 years anonymous boosted in

1464
01:28:00,660 --> 01:28:07,060
with a thousand sats just to say regarding caring about if the art is generated from

1465
01:28:07,060 --> 01:28:12,260
AI when I'm looking at it I'm looking at it not because of the artist I'm looking at it

1466
01:28:12,260 --> 01:28:15,500
because it's beautiful much like diamonds even when they're created in the lab they're

1467
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:19,180
still beautiful they're still art you know we got a couple of people that actually wrote

1468
01:28:19,180 --> 01:28:23,060
it and said they would listen to AI generated versions of the show well how do they know

1469
01:28:23,060 --> 01:28:26,340
they're not listening right now to that how do they know we need to generate some more

1470
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:31,140
stills how do we do this oh yeah we do need to yeah I'm running out of project I'm running

1471
01:28:31,140 --> 01:28:35,020
out of stills but I do we have the GPU power anywhere or do we spin up another one I don't

1472
01:28:35,020 --> 01:28:39,980
know you tell me I do not know we also got a bunch of boosts that either had no message

1473
01:28:39,980 --> 01:28:44,000
or they were streaming sats so we don't cover all of them so that way we can keep this tight

1474
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:50,260
enough but I do just want to do a couple of shout outs 250 sats from tepulus 500 sats

1475
01:28:50,260 --> 01:28:56,100
from code Michael and 100 sats from now science news thank you to them thank you to everyone

1476
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:59,180
who boosted and even if you didn't make it on the show and of course to all the ones

1477
01:28:59,180 --> 01:29:03,900
who do make it on the show if you'd like to participate in the grand experiment you can

1478
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:07,780
get a new podcast app at new podcast apps calm we're building a network of people that

1479
01:29:07,780 --> 01:29:11,480
are armed with sats and we're starting to see a couple of open source projects come

1480
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:15,660
on but we're also seeing a lot of podcasters come online and I think this is a critical

1481
01:29:15,660 --> 01:29:19,780
moment in podcasting I think we are witnessing West what was the one you were listening to

1482
01:29:19,780 --> 01:29:24,380
recently where they had just these horrible dynamic inserted ads yeah I think it was the

1483
01:29:24,380 --> 01:29:28,720
Conan O'Brien podcast yep and it was like it was one of those gambling you know platform

1484
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:33,860
sports betting kind of things and then after the ad it was this supercut and slightly tight

1485
01:29:33,860 --> 01:29:39,900
and and sped up sped up yeah like 1.25x speed without me doing the ad but just of the ad

1486
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:43,420
and them doing all the disclaimers state by state for the different hotlines if you have

1487
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:48,740
a gambling problem which that's good people should get help but like it was a solid 30

1488
01:29:48,740 --> 01:29:52,020
seconds and I was like I just was trying to listen to the podcast I don't mind a little

1489
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:55,140
ad because most of his ads are kind of like you're you know like yeah they're funny and

1490
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:59,700
they're like organic this was just garbage well you know what they do is so when when

1491
01:29:59,700 --> 01:30:03,660
revenue dips and this is going to be happening more and more is you just turn to the dynamic

1492
01:30:03,660 --> 01:30:08,820
ads it's kind of like monetizing on YouTube and I just not the direction to go and there

1493
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:13,100
is it's there somehow they made them worse than radio ads which is what's remarkable

1494
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:17,660
is like you would never thought it was going to happen in podcasting and I hate to see

1495
01:30:17,660 --> 01:30:21,940
this happening and I feel like we're building an alternative with podcasting 2.0 and the

1496
01:30:21,940 --> 01:30:26,260
value for value stuff so I'm hoping that this is an idea that spreads and if you'd like

1497
01:30:26,260 --> 01:30:30,540
to participate new podcast apps calm if you're in the States and you want to grab some stats

1498
01:30:30,540 --> 01:30:35,780
really easy the cash app and the strike app make that super easy to do the cash app just

1499
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:39,980
recently added lightning support so there's a major vendor on lightning now hey yo and

1500
01:30:39,980 --> 01:30:45,500
then if you're outside the states blue wallets and robosats and others are great ways to

1501
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:50,220
go now we're running kind of long so we're going to skip the pics this week so why don't

1502
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:54,880
we mention that we will be live next week we are doing our fedora 37 review we'd love

1503
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:59,120
to have you join us for that that's at Jupiter dot tube we usually kick off the stream a

1504
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:04,420
little bit before noon pacific 3 p.m. eastern over there so get your browser fired up or

1505
01:31:04,420 --> 01:31:10,300
your VLC client or your MPV head over to Jupiter dot tube and help us peer out the stream see

1506
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:16,460
you next week same bad time same bad station we need like a phrase for that like when you're

1507
01:31:16,460 --> 01:31:20,340
when you're helping seed the stream is that it because it's all peer-to-peer it is all

1508
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:24,960
peer-to-peer and so it lets us run our own YouTube basically right we're not paying our

1509
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:30,940
big CDN bills up and it's part of the federation it's a powerful set of tooling I love it self-hosted

1510
01:31:30,940 --> 01:31:36,820
value for value self-hosted live streaming self-hosted live interaction you know like

1511
01:31:36,820 --> 01:31:42,340
just love it self-hosted Twitter self-hosted and masks on you know I don't know maybe let

1512
01:31:42,340 --> 01:31:45,500
us know what you think thank you so much for tuning this week's episode of the unplug

1513
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:50,820
program links to what we talked about today at Linux unplug comm slash what 484 384 you'll

1514
01:31:50,820 --> 01:31:55,340
figure it out figure it out see you next week

1515
01:32:20,820 --> 01:32:30,900
I have a question and I am very afraid of what the answer is gonna be but I think I

1516
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:37,100
know what it's gonna be I think my car has a blown head gasket not my not my car but

1517
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:43,400
my wife's car has a blown head gasket oh typically if you think that it does it probably does

1518
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:48,700
here's the symptoms I'm seeing we're using we've we not always but we've had to refill

1519
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:53,300
the coolant a couple of times but there's no dripping oh and the catalytic converter

1520
01:32:53,300 --> 01:33:01,500
is clogged up oh oh god I did a ob2 port scan and I noticed that bank one is running rich

1521
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:06,020
and it's adding fuel especially at low idles it's adding like 16% fuel and then on the

1522
01:33:06,020 --> 01:33:13,060
freeway doing like 2% and I'm thinking like okay so coolants gone not rapid coolant but

1523
01:33:13,060 --> 01:33:18,500
a little bit of coolant thinking running rich thinking clogged cat does it report like

1524
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:22,860
compression on each cylinder as well do you have that kind of detail you know I didn't

1525
01:33:22,860 --> 01:33:27,140
see that look for it I think that's a good that would be a key indicator huh I think

1526
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:31,100
I'm gonna bring it in and find out I like our impromptu car talk segment here yeah little

1527
01:33:31,100 --> 01:33:37,420
car talk little Linux core talk before cars are computers pop up a pop Prince garage well

1528
01:33:37,420 --> 01:33:42,220
cars are computers yeah they were especially this one let me tell you Chris did you try

1529
01:33:42,220 --> 01:33:48,460
a last-minute upgrade see if that fixes it right
