1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
I didn't think it would happen, but Microsoft is going to allow WSL2 distros to run on

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,800
Windows Server.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,240
I don't know, I thought they'd draw the line, because of course, once you allow WSL on

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,200
Windows Server, why even use Windows Server stuff to start running it all under Linux?

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:31,640
All the license fees, the same amount of Linux.

6
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,640
Hello friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,640
My name is Chris.

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,640
My name is Wes.

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,640
And my name is Brent.

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,640
Hello, gentlemen.

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,160
Well, coming up on the show today, it's one of my favorite episodes, we're going to go

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:48,100
back in time and witness the early days of a tool that is just ubiquitous now, something

13
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,520
we talk about all the time.

14
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,720
But where did it come from?

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,600
And then we're going to jump forward 15 years and join our buddy Brent on his journey to

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,600
learn that tooling.

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,040
Well, they just got back from a family road trip to Bozeman, Montana.

18
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,840
I got a couple of stories to share with you guys.

19
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,440
And then we'll round it out with some great boosts and pics and more.

20
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,400
So before we go any further, let's say hello to our virtual lug, time appropriate gradients

21
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,400
mumble room.

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
Hello, hello.

23
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,400
Hello.

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,400
Hello, everybody.

25
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,400
That's great.

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,400
Strong show in today.

27
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,400
We got it.

28
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,400
We got a great mumble show.

29
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,400
We got all folks in the live chat.

30
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:26,920
Of course, we're doing this on a Sunday around noon Pacific is usually when we get started.

31
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,880
Whenever Wes shows up, you know, we'll just get the show going.

32
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,440
I like to make an entrance.

33
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,440
Yeah.

34
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,440
Yeah.

35
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,440
Oh, boy.

36
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,440
Tell me about it.

37
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,440
He's got a whole long list of stuff, too.

38
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,800
So yeah, I just got back.

39
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,800
Welcome back.

40
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,800
Every time you leave, I worry you might not come back.

41
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,240
So I feel like we got to make it, you know, we're happy to see you.

42
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,680
I am kind of still riding high.

43
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,640
It's like we actually pulled it off.

44
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,280
You know, gas prices are crazy.

45
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,120
Plus, whenever you're whenever you're going about 800 miles each way, something could

46
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,120
happen.

47
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,120
Right.

48
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,720
And indeed, a few things did happen.

49
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,720
No.

50
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,720
Is Joups OK?

51
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,720
Joups is all right.

52
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,680
Um, Adia's car, on the other hand, oh, no, oh, no.

53
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,120
Just as we were getting gas, we just started out and she was navigating around the gas

54
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,120
station.

55
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,800
It was crazy.

56
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,920
And they have these short like poles around a light post.

57
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:22,880
And she backed up and and broke the that like the driver's side, you know, brake light.

58
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,360
And that was kind of a rocky start because she's like, oh, you know, we've been on the

59
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,360
road for like 30 minutes.

60
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,120
Oh, this was like as you were leaving.

61
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,120
Yeah.

62
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,120
Yeah.

63
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,120
Oh, God.

64
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,120
Is this a bad sign or what?

65
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,440
But we got on the road and it was pretty good.

66
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,960
Other than I'm pretty sure I had covid not positive, but I'm pretty sure I got covid

67
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,360
a couple of days before about about five days before we left.

68
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,360
Right.

69
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,360
I was trying to do prerecord.

70
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,280
So, of course, we couldn't prerecord, which meant we had to do some stuff on the road.

71
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,420
Just had to be dealt with on the road.

72
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,420
But I started getting better.

73
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,900
Not one hundred percent, but I got enough, you know, to do this because it is a big deal

74
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,900
for the kids.

75
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,320
It's like a yearly thing.

76
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,840
And so we get down actually.

77
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,520
You got to actually drive them out there.

78
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,520
Right.

79
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,520
I'm the driver.

80
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,520
You can't get around.

81
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,520
It's up to me.

82
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,120
So we get down there the first night and I'm like, I'm not feeling so good.

83
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,200
He says, well, I'll take the kids over, we'll go swimming, we'll go for a few hours.

84
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,280
You get like one night of quiet, like, OK, great.

85
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,280
Thank you.

86
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,280
That's that's thank you.

87
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,280
That's so sweet of you.

88
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,280
Really appreciate it.

89
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,280
And so she takes the kids off.

90
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,280
And I'm like, well, this is great.

91
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,280
I'll chill out a little bit.

92
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,400
I'll get caught up on my messages.

93
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,720
Maybe I'll lay down because I'm still not feeling very great.

94
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:34,120
And about 20 minutes into my super relaxing night, I I open up the bathroom door and I

95
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,680
see a puddle of water at the foot of the toilet.

96
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,680
Oh, no.

97
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,680
Oh, no.

98
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,680
This isn't a good thing.

99
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,280
Either, you know, best case scenario, someone pissed all over the floor.

100
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,280
Right.

101
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,280
That's my best case scenario.

102
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,280
Right.

103
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,280
Fingers crossed for that.

104
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,280
Yeah.

105
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,280
So I'm like, OK.

106
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,280
And I look at it.

107
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,520
It doesn't it doesn't look like it doesn't look like it came from a human.

108
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,200
It looks like clear water and it's coming right from the base of the toilet.

109
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,420
And I think to myself, oh, no, my toilet is leaking.

110
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:06,880
So I mop it up, make sure, you know, and shake the toilet a little bit.

111
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,080
You know, like I just grab the bowl and I just shake it a little bit and more water

112
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,080
seeps out.

113
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,080
Oh, no.

114
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,640
And I'm like, oh, and I got a thing with water.

115
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,720
I got a thing with water in this RV right now.

116
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,440
And I just I was devastated.

117
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,800
Like my evening went from like, hey, I'm chillin to like, I'm getting rid of this RV.

118
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,040
Everything is horrible.

119
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,560
We're going to just get in the car and drive home.

120
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,200
I'm going to burn this thing to the ground.

121
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,200
Right.

122
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,200
Wow.

123
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,200
I just couldn't.

124
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,200
Yep.

125
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,160
And so I dried all up and I check in 20 minutes later and there's more water there.

126
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,160
So, OK.

127
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,160
All right.

128
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,960
Shut off the water to the RV because, of course, I don't have a knob just for the toilet.

129
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,760
So shut off all the water.

130
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,080
And I sit there waiting, you know, for Hadid to get back so that way I can tell her the

131
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,560
bad news, be like, we got to solve this because we don't have a functioning toilet on our

132
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,440
family road trip.

133
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,480
And so we go to bed, you know, we think on it a little bit.

134
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,360
Next morning we wake up and we're like, OK, it's daylight.

135
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,980
Let's take a look at this thing.

136
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:09,520
And we realized that because these these RV toilets have a pedal to flush them.

137
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,160
We realized that it was once again, the leak was actually coming from the pedal where the

138
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,380
valve that actually turns the water on and off is.

139
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,600
And then it was just running behind the toilet and coming out.

140
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,380
And so we think, OK, well, we fix this before we start looking at it.

141
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,280
Of course, there's no parts.

142
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,280
There's no parts.

143
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,320
And Hadid is like, well, there's pretty much nothing we can do but bang on it.

144
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,320
Oh, my God, I can do that.

145
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,920
So I bang on it a bit.

146
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,920
Doesn't fix the problem.

147
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,960
Surprise, surprise.

148
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,840
So she heads out to try to find parts.

149
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,840
Doesn't find anything.

150
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,180
Ends up getting a whole new toilet, just a whole new one.

151
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:47,080
So we had to do a toilet swab in Bozeman, Montana, which of course, the plumbing doesn't

152
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,120
line up, you know, the plumbing doesn't line up.

153
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,880
So like we're like cutting the plumbing and like rerunning the lines and like bringing

154
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,960
that in.

155
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,220
And of course, when you take the toilet out, there's just a hole in the ground that goes

156
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,320
down to the black tank.

157
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,000
So like we're trying to like keep that capped and not drop anything down in there because

158
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,700
then that would be gone forever.

159
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,660
So that's how you lose a kid right there.

160
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:11,700
Basically lost an entire day to fixing the toilet in Montana.

161
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,560
But now we got a better than ever toilet.

162
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,320
Like whenever we upgrade and whatever we fix, we upgrade.

163
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,520
So now we got a real premium model, you know, and one of your residential units.

164
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,520
Oh, wow.

165
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,520
Only with the pedal.

166
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,520
Sure, sure.

167
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,520
Yeah.

168
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,200
So that was good, you know, but probably not the most frustrating, well, maybe it was

169
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
the most frustrating.

170
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,560
It was probably the most frustrating, but not the most technical issue to solve.

171
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,560
Right.

172
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,400
It was just like a mechanical problem.

173
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,400
Right.

174
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,600
And these things happen, especially the plumbing as you're going down the road, they can shake

175
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,840
loose a little bit.

176
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,640
And if anything was just kind of on the verge of cracking or breaking, it does.

177
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,640
That's what's going to happen.

178
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,640
Yeah.

179
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,640
Joop's a seven years old, too.

180
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,640
And this toilet's a full time toilet.

181
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,760
So it's seen things.

182
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,040
Yeah, it has seen things.

183
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,760
I mean, Brent knows we've been through things with our toilet.

184
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
Oh, yeah.

185
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,920
And of course, props to my wife.

186
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,880
She's a she's a real like, just dive in and fix it gal.

187
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,880
She goes out there.

188
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,880
She hurts.

189
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,800
She talks to the guys, even though she doesn't, you know, necessarily understand the language.

190
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,280
She manages to break through that and get the stuff and we got it all connected.

191
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,440
And what you want in a crisis is an idea.

192
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,440
That's for sure.

193
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,440
Yeah.

194
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,080
So but on the on the on the side of like technical issues that I had to deal with on this road

195
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,400
trip.

196
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,400
Real quick recap.

197
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,880
I've talked about my Starlink setup before.

198
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,440
These are what I effing love about Starlink other than it brings internet to remote places

199
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,680
where I couldn't get connected before is that it's Linux, right?

200
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:32,560
These are Linux satellites and these are Linux dishes and they have it's just the whole stack

201
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,560
is Linux.

202
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,560
And it's so great.

203
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,760
Even their Wi-Fi router is also Linux.

204
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,040
And so it's such an interesting implementation of the software that we've talked about for

205
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,040
15 years.

206
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:47,080
You know, we've gone from arguing and debating if TVOization was going to destroy Linux to

207
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,960
now I've got Linux powered internet.

208
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,960
Right.

209
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,040
And my circular dish, the little worm motor in there broke during transportation.

210
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:01,320
And I ended up getting it replaced with a new square dish, which is easier to transport.

211
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,560
And I got myself a sweet little crate that I have it all in there at Frankenstein kind

212
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:11,480
of zombied up the box they used for shipping and I created myself a nice waterproof crate.

213
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,120
So I get on location.

214
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,480
This is the first time I've really used this new dish and putting it through the paces.

215
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:23,840
I had to get their silly ethernet adapter because they've got this proprietary ethernet

216
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,480
cable where they lop off the RJ45 and they put on there this proprietary like USB-C kind

217
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,520
of looking connector.

218
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,240
And there's a strange connector, super long weird connectors.

219
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,040
And so you run the ethernet adapter in line.

220
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:42,080
So you go you run from the dish to the ethernet adapter from the ethernet adapter to the router.

221
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,840
And that's where I break off and I plug in the ethernet to my router, which is a peplink

222
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,160
max transit duo.

223
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:55,360
And this combines three different cellular connections, campground Wi-Fi and Starlink

224
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,360
over my WAN port.

225
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,240
And it brings it all together in one interface and balances it all.

226
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,680
The idea with ethernet is to just take out any kind of possible introduced latency by

227
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,480
Wi-Fi or any kind of drops because I want to be able to do remote streams and remote

228
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,680
recording.

229
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,880
And when you're doing these apps, you want good solid connectivity, lowest latency possible

230
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,560
and you don't want to drop frames.

231
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,040
So I chose to use the ethernet connection.

232
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,920
And with this new square dish, you've got to keep the router in play and all that's

233
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,920
fine, whatever.

234
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,640
But I was just dropping packets like crazy.

235
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,820
And I look at the app and they have a nice app that lets you scan the sky and see if

236
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,820
you have good visibility.

237
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,520
I had great visibility in Montana.

238
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,100
It's big sky country.

239
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,240
And I had a great shot.

240
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,720
The app says, you're good to go, bro.

241
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,640
And I think, OK, well, then why am I dropping so many damn packets?

242
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,920
I mean, it's like one in three, one in four packets I was losing.

243
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,520
I couldn't use the Starlink for anything.

244
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:51,760
But when I test the speed on the dish itself, I'm getting like one hundred and fifteen megabits.

245
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,680
So the dish is getting good connectivity, the dish is getting good ping time.

246
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,440
But when I'm using it on my LAN, I'm dropping packets like a maniac.

247
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,080
Couldn't use it for anything, not even browsing the web.

248
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,880
And I start doing troubleshooting and I discover that apparently there's some issue with my

249
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:16,640
particular Peplink brand router and the Starlink Ethernet adapter.

250
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,040
And you know, people don't really know what they're talking about online, so who knows.

251
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,440
But it seems to be maybe like it's constantly renegotiating if it's a gigabit full duplex

252
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,760
hundred megabit full duplex and maybe the max transit can't quite handle the gigabit

253
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,760
connection.

254
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,760
I don't know if that's true or not.

255
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,240
I'm only trying to push a hundred megabits or whatever.

256
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,680
And people online tell me that if I put a hub and I'm curious if this if anybody else

257
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,200
has heard of this, I put a hub between the Ethernet adapter and my router.

258
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,200
So I go from the Ethernet adapter into a hub and then from the hub into my router.

259
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
Problem solved.

260
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,240
Well, I didn't have a spare hub, so I ended up connecting to the Starlink over Wi-Fi and

261
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,880
it's been working fine.

262
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:59,800
But it's one of these things where version one, the round dish, didn't have these kinds

263
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,800
of problems, right?

264
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,280
I just ran Ethernet from the dish into my router and I was good to go.

265
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:10,680
Straight from the dish itself, from the Linux host in that little dish right into my router.

266
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,520
But now I got to go through this Ethernet adapter and this Ethernet adapter apparently

267
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,080
has some sort of negotiation issue.

268
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:19,920
And of course, they just launched the RV product and supposedly thirty thousand RV owners have

269
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,240
ordered this.

270
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,620
And this these Peplink routers are super popular in the RV community.

271
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,320
So now now you're on the path to, right?

272
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,160
It's like if most people are doing the Wi-Fi, this will be less tested, probably less well

273
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,720
understood by the customer support staff, etc.

274
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,440
Yeah, I don't like it.

275
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,440
I don't like it.

276
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,400
I think the big question for me becomes why even bother with the adapter?

277
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,240
It sounds like they're putting this proprietary connector for reasons we don't understand.

278
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,760
Like it is there an advantage to it in some scenario?

279
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,680
Because it just seems like you're adding extra bits that are just causing potential issues.

280
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,160
So if you could skip over that somehow.

281
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,680
I'm trying to bypass using Wi-Fi, you know, that's why I want it.

282
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,840
I don't want to use Wi-Fi for that last.

283
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,720
You heard there was an option to not.

284
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,040
But in my setup, it's all wired, you know, my machine I'm recording from is wired to

285
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,040
my router.

286
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,280
My router is wired to my Starlink and then the Starlink is about as wireless as it gets.

287
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,600
Let's be honest.

288
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,200
Starlink is it's pretty great.

289
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,480
Audio listeners, you can't see this, but he's holding like an RJ45 crimping tool in his

290
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,720
hands right now.

291
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,200
So it's pretty dedicated.

292
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:26,040
You know, they've got reportedly now 500,000 users in 32 countries now.

293
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,220
15,000 Starlink terminals have been sent to Ukraine.

294
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,560
They are beginning to launch the 1.5 version of the satellites.

295
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:38,120
Those have the optical terminals and they should be online by the end of the year.

296
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,720
They're about to run a test using laser links to provide connectivity in polar regions where

297
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,120
there's no ground stations, of course.

298
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,640
And this is really good news.

299
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,000
Version two of the satellites will be 10 times dimmer.

300
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Hopefully.

301
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Yeah.

302
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,280
Principal engineer David Goldstein says that they're working on a technology that will

303
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,600
make version two satellites 10 times dimmer than Vantablack paint.

304
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,600
I guess that must be it.

305
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,440
Oh, you haven't heard of Vantablack.

306
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,440
That's for later.

307
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,440
Oh, yeah.

308
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,440
OK.

309
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,440
It sounds cool.

310
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,440
Oh, yeah, it is.

311
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,120
On the user side, Starlink as a service is sort of a life changer.

312
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,420
Unfortunately, everywhere I go, it's oversubscribed now.

313
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:20,760
Even in Montana, it was not I wasn't kidding speeds I initially got five months ago.

314
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,760
And I think what's happening is people in residential areas are ordering these RV versions

315
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,000
and they're over and they're using them in overpopulated cells where they'd otherwise

316
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
have to wait.

317
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,600
Sounds like you're in that sort of awkward territory, right?

318
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:36,040
You got the like initial experience when it was new and limited and more technical, perhaps.

319
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,640
And now you're in the like the starts of optimizing for a more general audience.

320
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,160
And then that has some backtracking on some issues which will surely get fixed down the

321
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,160
line.

322
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,160
It's just going to take time.

323
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,600
Well, and you and I were kind of debating this earlier, but I sort of feel like unlike

324
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:55,640
traditional telco infrastructure, they sort of build out and then that infrastructure

325
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,440
sort of what they use for like 10, 20 years.

326
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,140
Like look at cable internet, look at DSL, like our area where they rolled out fiber

327
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:06,020
even they sort of stopped about 30 percent of the rollout way.

328
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:10,720
And then they've just never gone back to it for like a decade with a few exceptions here

329
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,720
and there.

330
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,200
But with Starlink, they can keep launching satellites, they can keep building ground

331
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,960
stations and kind of scale it away that I don't think you see traditional telco operator

332
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,960
scale.

333
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,920
Assuming they get Starship worked out.

334
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,920
Yeah.

335
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,920
Right.

336
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,920
That's the big thing here.

337
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,920
Yeah.

338
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,920
And you know.

339
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,920
Which I mean that's progressing now.

340
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,920
So.

341
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,920
Also, it appears that they're about to go to or they already are.

342
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:37,200
There's a Cold War that's getting hot right now between Dish Network and Starlink.

343
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,560
So first of all, Dish is like trying to get Starlink busted for selling the RV version.

344
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,560
Yeah.

345
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:49,160
Specifically trying to go after Elon for promoting the RV version because he didn't explicitly

346
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,920
state that you can't use it while in motion because Elon didn't tweet that you're not

347
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,080
allowed to use it on motion.

348
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:59,600
They're trying to get him in trouble because the FCC doesn't give them a license to use

349
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,600
Starlink in motion.

350
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,640
It does seem to be technically possible.

351
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,880
You can actually use it in motion, but you're not supposed to.

352
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:11,000
And so they are making a case to the FCC to shut Starlink down.

353
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,480
They're going after SpaceX on this.

354
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,760
Of course, what's really happening is Dish is about to launch their own 12 gigahertz

355
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,360
5G only wireless network.

356
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:31,280
And that 12 gigahertz radio spectrum will interfere significantly with what start with

357
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,320
SpaceX is a 77 percent of their customers.

358
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:41,960
And so Dish Network has been lobbying the FCC for access to the 12 gigahertz band.

359
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,120
SpaceX is trying to get it to stop.

360
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,600
They're trying to show the data to demonstrate how it could be an issue.

361
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:55,080
And I'm really torn on this because, of course, I'd love more 5G network.

362
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,120
And I'd be interested to see what Dish could do in this area because they're kind of a

363
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,120
new contender.

364
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,120
Right.

365
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,720
But at the same time, I've been doing this for a while.

366
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,480
Nobody's got it across the line like SpaceX and Starlink have.

367
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,480
Like nobody has.

368
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,360
And it's not 100 percent of a product yet.

369
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,240
I don't know if I'd even consider it out of beta truly yet, but it is pretty phenomenal

370
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,440
to get a box and within 10 minutes you've got you get a box, it's got a cardboard insert

371
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,640
with three instructions, you know, you connect the wire, you put it in the pole, you connect

372
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:28,600
the router, you connect your app to the router and you're talking to space and you can go

373
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,480
places and get Internet access.

374
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,800
And that can be, you know, a lifesaver for some people.

375
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,520
Like if I, you know, if I ever get my dream of like living in some off-grid property where

376
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,680
I can do podcasts, how am I going to do without something like Starlink?

377
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:45,280
And so it kind of sucks to see Dish playing these games of like trying to go after Elon

378
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:49,000
personally or trying to go after SpaceX because they didn't implicitly tell you not to use

379
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,360
it while moving just so that way they can get the FCC to crack down on them.

380
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,160
So that way they can then use the 12 gigahertz spectrum for their own thing.

381
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,520
At the same time, I'm like, well, I'd like to see more competition.

382
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,080
Amazon is also going to launch their their Internet thing.

383
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:07,800
So there's more to come in this space just as I start to really get reliant on it and

384
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,920
I start to use it for work and these shows and become very happy and feel like I finally

385
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,000
got high speed Internet in my home.

386
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,840
You have this sort of degradation of the service itself as they sort of oversubscribe.

387
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:22,000
And you also have, of course, these corporate interests that are going to go after it now

388
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
too and, you know, play a little dirty so that way they can advance their agenda.

389
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,440
It's just such a go figure.

390
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,440
Yeah.

391
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,440
I mean, this one happens, right?

392
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,760
It's a new it's a new area to explore, a new way to offer services.

393
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,720
There's going to be some competition.

394
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,800
And as you so often learn, sometimes being an early adopter kind of bites.

395
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,800
Mm hmm.

396
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,800
Yeah.

397
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,920
There's usually a little downside just the way it goes.

398
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:49,660
We hinted on our dev one episode about one of you having it during the trip.

399
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:53,280
But I was never it was never clear who got the dev one this week.

400
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,520
So can you update us what who got the dev one and what to do with it?

401
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,920
It does a lot of pressure.

402
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,920
I've had the devil on.

403
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,920
But I didn't do anything crazy.

404
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,680
I've just been using it like a laptop is using it right now, actually.

405
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,480
I think your version of normal things on a laptop is probably crazy to most of us.

406
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,200
I didn't do anything crazy with it because I kind of just wanted to see how it would

407
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,760
fit into my existing you know, if I got a dev one, what would it do?

408
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,720
So I would like to play a little more with the dev side of it.

409
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,720
I did.

410
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,720
I set up a little bit of a dev environment.

411
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,720
That was fine.

412
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,720
It's just a normal Linux machine.

413
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,980
But I didn't really push it to the limit or anything.

414
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:31,080
But it's been a really nice throw it around and bring it wherever I'm going laptop.

415
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,840
You know, I've been impressed with that because the battery life has been really quite decent.

416
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,640
So I didn't have to worry about sort of like being tethered to a charger.

417
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,080
Plus that you can do USB-C as well as it's the proprietary version meant that like I

418
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,760
already had USB-C things hanging around my house.

419
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,920
So if I did need to top up the battery, that was easy, you know, and it was and it was

420
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,240
just right there.

421
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,440
I also did notice at one point I kind of forgot that I had unplugged a charger that I you

422
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,580
know, I plugged it into the laptop forgetting that I'd unplugged that from like I'd changed

423
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:04,280
out my power splitter situation and it made a really cute little beeping sound.

424
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,280
It was going to die.

425
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,440
And here I'm like listening, I'm cooking in the kitchen.

426
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,280
I just see this little like it wasn't scary, it wasn't like alarming, but just a little

427
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:17,480
cry for help from the laptop reminding me, hey, I'm here, plug me in.

428
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,480
That sounds nice.

429
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,160
And Chris, I know you had some success with your ThinkPad, but did you miss having it?

430
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,160
Yeah, I did.

431
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:28,360
I didn't get a chance to game much, but that's an area where I really would have missed it.

432
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,240
Dylan brought his laptop and if I would have had a gaming laptop, I think we probably would

433
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,760
have done a little bit of gaming.

434
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,680
So that's I was like, OK, I miss it for that.

435
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:41,000
The ThinkPad otherwise did did really do the heavy lifting for this trip.

436
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,020
But the APU on there, I mean, it's essentially it's a Steam Deck only with a 1080p screen

437
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,960
and in a laptop form.

438
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,480
So you can play pretty much anything on there.

439
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,480
Yeah.

440
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,480
Yeah.

441
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,480
You know, yours is here.

442
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,480
It arrived while I was in Texas.

443
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,480
Brent.

444
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,480
Whoa.

445
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,480
That's exciting.

446
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,820
I forgot to arrive as well at the same time.

447
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,040
So we'll have to figure that out.

448
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,600
We still have to figure that part out.

449
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,680
That's for sure.

450
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:09,080
But in between shows, listener Jeff, who you guys may remember, he's he's been on the show

451
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,280
before, of course, but also he helped me out at the junkyard.

452
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,960
He helped us build out some power setups for Lady Jupes.

453
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,520
He's in the Mamba room right now.

454
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,640
And he chipped in on a nice pack of RAM.

455
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,640
What was it?

456
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,640
I don't know.

457
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,640
What was it?

458
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,640
How much was it?

459
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,640
And has it arrived?

460
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,640
It certainly has arrived.

461
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,660
So I've received the RAM for the Dev1, but I have not received the Dev1, which is kind

462
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,820
of a funny situation.

463
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:35,060
But Jeff was kind enough to we did a back and forth to try to find RAM in Canada.

464
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:40,660
That was a reasonable price and available, which seems difficult right now for some reason.

465
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:46,780
But Jeff, you're kind enough to max the Dev1 out whenever I get it, which is about 64 gigs

466
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:50,280
of DDR4, which is super generous.

467
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,680
I don't even know what I'm going to do with all that.

468
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,160
So open to ideas.

469
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,200
So, Jeff, thank you so much.

470
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,800
That is very, very, very super kind of you.

471
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,800
It's absolute pleasure.

472
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,240
Hopefully you can put it to good use, have some real compute power.

473
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,720
Think of all the quick EMU VMs you can have.

474
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,220
Oh, yeah, we'll find uses for that RAM.

475
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:14,440
But not only that, Jeff went the extra mile because, you know, Jeff is Jeff and he's wonderful.

476
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,440
And he also...

477
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,440
A kilometer.

478
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,920
I thought this is in Canada.

479
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,920
Which, right.

480
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,920
Sorry.

481
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,920
Sorry.

482
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,920
Be inclusive.

483
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:29,320
He also apparently sent a box filled with a NanoStation M2 from Ubiquiti and an AC1200,

484
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:34,520
which is hopefully going to solve my network problem here locally.

485
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,900
So I just got to say, Jeff, you're amazing.

486
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,900
Thank you.

487
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:43,400
We have the best listeners ever, the best friends ever, and I really appreciate it.

488
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:50,720
We do have a couple of housekeeping items we wanted to update you on.

489
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,140
Probably we should start with meetups.

490
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:58,600
The J.B. London meetup, August 5th, is, I guess, is that the new time and date, 6 p.m.

491
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,600
London time?

492
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,600
We have that information now.

493
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,600
That's good.

494
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,400
It turns out we were saying 6 p.m. GMT previously, and apparently that's wrong.

495
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,960
I guess us North Americans, we don't, oops.

496
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,720
So a few listeners, Paul and Richard, kindly corrected us.

497
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:18,800
So 6 p.m. London time, which is not GMT, but something else, BST or something like that.

498
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,660
Well, here's what we're doing.

499
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:26,380
Because these things happen, they're dynamic situations, we have set up a J.B. meetups

500
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,560
matrix space.

501
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,660
It's early days, but we have a dedicated room in there for the London meetup.

502
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:35,800
We have a Pacific Northwest room in there, and we have a Mumble meetup room in there.

503
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:40,160
So this is a space that contains multiple rooms, and we can create more, and then we'll

504
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:45,880
have standing chat rooms for events that we can jump into and participate and coordinate.

505
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:50,360
Yeah, meet other folks that are going, coordinate around rides, whatever you need.

506
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:55,200
Yep, like the next time we do a Raleigh meetup, we'll make a Raleigh room, and if you'd like

507
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,280
to participate in there, just contact me on Matrix.

508
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,280
We can get you set up.

509
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:03,000
But the rooms are available to the public, and we will have them linked in the show notes,

510
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,640
and you can start coordinating your London meetup in there.

511
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,640
We already made one for London.

512
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,720
If you needed one more reason to get a Matrix account set up, here it is.

513
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,620
And of course, details and any time changes, location changes, that'll be on our actual

514
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:20,040
meetup page at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

515
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:25,160
There we go.

516
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,360
lino.com slash unplugged.

517
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,960
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account, and you go there to support the

518
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,960
show.

519
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,040
GeeksCloud with 11 data centers around the world.

520
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,120
It's what we've been using for more than a couple of years now, and they've been at it

521
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,240
for over 19 years, and I have friends personally who've used it for over a decade.

522
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,640
It's a really, really nice way to host your applications.

523
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,800
It's like the best way.

524
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:52,440
Personally, I wouldn't run my stuff anywhere because I feel like the speed and reliability

525
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:57,740
of our infrastructure is part of the overall package, and so you just really couldn't convince

526
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:03,040
me to go with a better performance, reliability, support, and price ratio.

527
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:07,560
In fact, they're 30 to 50% cheaper than some of the major cloud providers out there.

528
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,760
And Linode's been rolling out features since I've been a customer that just keep making

529
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,760
it better and better.

530
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,760
If you've got a minute, you've got to go check it out.

531
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:21,840
They just recently announced hosted database support for Postgres, MongoDB, and MySQL.

532
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,720
And I'll put a link in the show notes.

533
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,680
Just a few days ago, they released a guide to migrate your Postgres database to their

534
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,740
managed database solution, which is something I'm going to look at.

535
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:36,420
And then they've also recently released an infrastructure as code ebook by Justin Mitchell.

536
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:40,640
It's a step-by-step infrastructure as code guide for Terraform, Ansible, Puppet, Chef

537
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,320
Salt, and of course, some GitHub.

538
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,800
Love is in there as well.

539
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,800
It's totally free.

540
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,200
You don't even have to put your email address in there to get this thing.

541
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,680
So I'll put a link to that in the show notes as well because that is like a super valuable

542
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,680
thing.

543
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,600
If I started in IT, I would have had to go to the library and pay 35, 45, 65 bucks for

544
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,120
something like that.

545
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,020
You kids these days and your great deals.

546
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,880
It's the same thing with deploying infrastructure now at Linode.

547
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,400
Stuff that literally would take me two weeks at best, maybe a month, I can now do in 30

548
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,860
seconds on Linode.

549
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,140
And the performance is just so great.

550
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,980
The beast of a system we have running our matrix box has just been killer.

551
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,740
It's totally absorbed the growth.

552
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:23,060
It's really so nice to be able to just kind of incrementally upgrade that stuff too because

553
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:26,040
we didn't start at that high end of a machine.

554
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:30,160
We just kind of slowly built to that as user demand required it, and Linode was there the

555
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,160
whole way.

556
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:36,240
There are so many great options, so many great things to try on Linode, but fundamentally,

557
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,760
it's just the best way to run applications in the cloud under your control with the best

558
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,840
support in the business.

559
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,680
So why not get $100 to try it out and support the show?

560
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,600
Go to linode.com slash unplugged.

561
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:53,960
Well, I've been lazing about playing with the Dev1.

562
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,520
Chris has been learning basic plumbing skills, turns out.

563
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,920
Brent, what have you been up to while we've been away?

564
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:06,720
You know, I've actually been spending a ton of time on my drum kit, but also I have been

565
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:13,760
diving into Git, which is something I'm slightly embarrassed that I don't know yet and have

566
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,760
skills in.

567
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,720
I'm like, hey, any time to try is now, right?

568
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:24,080
And the reason I've been doing that is that a few episodes ago, we talked about the new

569
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,240
Jupiter broadcasting website that the community is kind of putting together with us.

570
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,200
And Stefan is working super hard on that.

571
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,300
I think he has a little tracker of how many hours he spent on it yet.

572
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:39,080
So far, I think he's up to like 13, which to me is impressive what he's got done in

573
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,200
that time.

574
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:45,400
But I thought I could help with that effort, but in order to do that, I would need to learn

575
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,680
Git.

576
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:50,200
Better reason than to use the new website to do that.

577
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:56,240
So I have been diving into Git, trying to understand how it all works, pinging Wes at

578
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:01,000
all times of the day to try to, you know, how does it give me more?

579
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,780
I don't quite wrap my head around it, but it's been super fascinating to dive into the

580
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:11,360
history of Git, and I only have like a little tiny understanding.

581
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,860
But you guys have been around a little longer than I have, at least in the Git world.

582
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:17,280
So can you can you inform me a little bit?

583
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,720
Yeah, stay a while and listen.

584
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,380
You know, I love that you're doing this, Brent.

585
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:23,760
First of all, it's just great to have your help with the new website.

586
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,380
Not everybody's willing to like, understand that there's a bunch of bunch of first principles

587
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,200
they have to go learn first before they can participate.

588
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,120
And so we thought, all right, well, let's go back in time about 15 years to the real

589
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:41,560
early days of Git, which is now just this super important tool that is used to manage

590
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,880
so many, so many, so many projects out there.

591
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:51,040
But back then, it was kind of considered like this hard to use, confusing tooling.

592
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:56,460
And so Linus Torvalds was invited to do a talk at Google back in 2007, and I wanted

593
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,280
to play a little bit of the introduction for Linus.

594
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:03,720
You can kind of hear the general attitude towards something that today it's like ubiquitous.

595
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,280
Yeah, we just take it for granted, man.

596
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,280
Yeah, but back then, it wasn't.

597
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,880
Thank you for coming, everybody.

598
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,560
Some of you have probably already heard of Linus Torvalds.

599
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:19,480
Those of you who haven't, you're the people with Macintoshes on your laps.

600
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:23,120
He's a guy who delights in being cruel to people.

601
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,000
His latest cruel act is to create a revision control system which is expressly designed

602
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,080
to make you feel less intelligent than you thought you were.

603
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,160
Thank you for coming down today, Linus.

604
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,120
I've been getting emails the past few days from people saying, where's Linus?

605
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,840
Why hasn't he merged my tree?

606
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,840
Doesn't he love me anymore?

607
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,800
I only walked into my office this afternoon.

608
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,480
What are you doing here?

609
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,400
But thank you for taking the time off.

610
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:49,560
So Linus is here today to explain to us why on earth he would write a software tool which

611
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:53,360
only he is smart enough to know how to use.

612
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,360
Thanks, Linus.

613
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:02,360
A real comedian, this guy, right, cracking the jokes about Git.

614
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:08,560
And Linus goes up there, and it's a classic younger Linus, it's prime Linus, and he explains

615
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:12,400
kind of why he likes using Git by explaining why he hates the other stuff.

616
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:17,120
So I want to give a few credits before I start.

617
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:27,440
I look at CVS in a very, very negative way because I, in many ways, when I design Git,

618
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:33,920
it's the what would Jesus do except it's what would CVS never, ever do kind of approach

619
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,680
to source control management.

620
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,640
I've never actually used CVS for the kernel.

621
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:46,440
For the first 10 years of kernel maintenance, we literally used tarballs and patches which

622
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:53,460
is a much superior source control management system than CVS is.

623
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:58,720
But I did end up using CVS for seven years at a commercial company, and I hate it with

624
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,780
a passion.

625
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:06,480
When I say I hate CVS with a passion, I have to also say that if there are any SVN users

626
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,960
in Subversion, users in the audience, you might want to leave.

627
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,800
It's just a classic, it's his classic presentation style.

628
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,400
Really his point was these other tools are just not good enough and especially they weren't

629
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:25,640
good enough for a project at the scale of the Linux project, the kernel, which is what

630
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,640
he had to solve.

631
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,640
Well, yeah, right.

632
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,200
I mean, it's still a unique project, but then especially then, like throughout that talk,

633
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:37,120
you kind of get a bunch of questions of folks sort of asking, okay, I guess I can see why

634
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,120
you'd need that for a weird project like the kernel where you have all these distributed

635
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,200
people working, you know, working in different time zones and across the world and with different

636
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,200
connectivity.

637
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,520
But do we really need Git for our like central corporate repo?

638
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:54,360
It's just wild to be reminded that people were skeptical, naturally skeptical of a new

639
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,280
paradigm and a new technology.

640
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,280
Right.

641
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,600
And this was, at the time of this talk, this was a year before GitHub launched.

642
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,080
The tooling was different back then, so people are a little more skeptical.

643
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,920
There wasn't that kind of easy to use front end that added that whole social collaboration

644
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,360
aspect as well.

645
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:16,360
There's also something that he seemed to kind of hone in on that was important to him early

646
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,560
on that I thought was interesting.

647
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:23,760
And it's like just something I take for granted about Git, but it's the offline distributed

648
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,760
nature.

649
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:30,420
I say it's so much more than just offline work, but the offline work part is actually

650
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:36,600
maybe the most obvious thing, which is that you can take a truly distributed source control

651
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,920
management system.

652
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:43,480
You can take it on a plane and even if they don't offer a Wi-Fi and satellite hookups,

653
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,920
you just continue working.

654
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,280
You can look at all your logs.

655
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,280
You can commit.

656
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:51,940
You can do everything you would do even if you were connected to a nice gigabit ethernet

657
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,540
directly to the backbone.

658
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,560
And that is really important.

659
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:02,760
It is doubly important when you have hundreds or thousands of people working on the same

660
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:11,400
project and they may not be literally disconnected, but in practice they aren't really well connected

661
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,860
either.

662
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:17,320
So part of distribution is this offline work theme.

663
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:21,560
Even if it's not completely offline, it is important to be able to do everything you

664
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:30,440
want to do from any location without having to be able to access a server.

665
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:39,920
What that basic fact actually results in is that you effectively have a lot more branching

666
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:46,880
because everybody who has a complete repository and can do commits on his own will effectively

667
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,400
have his own branch even if you don't realize it.

668
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:56,480
Even if you think of your project as just having a single branch, every single time

669
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,080
you disconnect your laptop and start working with it.

670
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,300
You are on your own branch.

671
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:08,520
And this is really, really important and is very different from anybody who's used CVS

672
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:14,480
where branching is considered something that only true gurus do.

673
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,040
This is probably something coming into GitHub and Git, you kind of just take for granted

674
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,880
right now that you can pull a copy down to your machine and work on it locally.

675
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:31,720
I think that's kind of maybe because I'm jumping into it at this time in Git's history.

676
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,880
But back then, it sure does sound like that was not the norm.

677
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,520
From kind of some of the research that I did, it seemed like it was always a server client

678
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:44,280
relationship where the source of truth and we're not that far from it, but the source

679
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,960
of truth was always on the server.

680
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,880
I would imagine in a corporate office, you know, that wouldn't be so bad.

681
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:54,100
But Linux seems to have changed the way that projects work.

682
00:33:54,100 --> 00:34:01,400
And so the concept of having the entire Git tree on your, you know, laptop or local computer

683
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:06,200
and thousands of people might have that or, you know, in the case of the project I'm working

684
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,300
on them, you know, I think we have like 10 people that are doing that and but everybody

685
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,980
has their own copy, and you're doing your own independent thing.

686
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:17,640
And then the ability to merge that later, I think is kind of really where all the magic

687
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,640
is happening.

688
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:23,520
It took me a little bit to wrap my head around the concepts, but man, are they ever elegant

689
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,720
once you really dive into it a little bit.

690
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:32,800
And well, I think it's pretty obvious to say that it's been working fairly well, considering

691
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,680
the accomplishments that Git has helped with.

692
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,720
So pretty cool.

693
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:43,040
Another part, though, I think is that is maybe not obvious is, you know, when you have this

694
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,880
distributed system, and you're not really privileging one branch, it means you have

695
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:50,880
a lot of different flexible working constraints, because you don't have this one sort of central

696
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:55,080
coordination point that everyone has to check in on, you can go off on your own for a while.

697
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:59,600
So like, you know, Chris, you're finally you get your RV parked up in Canada next to Brent,

698
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,880
and you guys are hashing out this new, a new theme for the website, and you have this whole

699
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,320
you want to go off on a tangent, you try out some new stuff and introduce some new things.

700
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,680
But maybe you know, the internet's not great, you don't want to be bothered, you don't have

701
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,680
to check in all your things, you guys can both be working independently, and then come

702
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,920
together and then at some later date, go meet up with folks with other repos, or the you

703
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,200
know, what we consider the source of truth that we happen to have chosen to host on GitHub

704
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,200
or something.

705
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,680
And then all of those can happen without anyone having to worry about what else someone else

706
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,600
is doing until you actually have to go do that merge at the end.

707
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:31,400
Yeah, that was the magic really to get brought and you could see for a guy like Linus, who's

708
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,560
working on a project the size of Linux kernel, bringing in all these different changes, trying

709
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,960
to figure out what changed what needs to be reviewed.

710
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,520
That kind of stuff was magic for him and was absolutely essential.

711
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,960
And you kind of get a taste of that where he describes what he loves the most about

712
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,960
Git.

713
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,600
Somebody sends a bug report, which bug reports are usually not very good.

714
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:56,100
But maybe the bug report is good enough that you can pinpoint, okay, SCSI subsystem.

715
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,760
That's the command line.

716
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:04,560
You can't say which file, but you can do this and say, okay, that will cut it down to from

717
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:12,400
the 15,000 commits we've had since last week, it will cut it down to 50.

718
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,240
That's a huge deal.

719
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:20,360
That is something that nobody else can do, I guarantee you.

720
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,760
So that's the reason you want to use Git.

721
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,900
That's what it all boils down to.

722
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,100
It's safe.

723
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:29,520
It is so fast that he can do things that nobody else can do.

724
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:34,720
It does things that nobody else can do even slowly, and it's distributed.

725
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,480
So go and spread the word.

726
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,560
Go and spread the word, he says.

727
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,000
We'll have a link to the full talk.

728
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
It is great.

729
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
It is great.

730
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Just go back to 2007.

731
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,640
Of course, a year after that talk, 2008 is when GitHub launched.

732
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:53,160
And in that talk, Linus talks a little bit about how the tooling is going to get easier

733
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,400
for people to use, and as the tooling gets easier, you'll have more and more people adopt

734
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,400
it.

735
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,400
And then a year later, GitHub.

736
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,400
Right.

737
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,400
GitHub drops.

738
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,400
You just could.

739
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,400
Yeah.

740
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,840
How much that has changed things, I don't think you could necessarily have foreseen.

741
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,840
Yeah.

742
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:10,400
So Brent, I'm curious to know what it's been like, what you've learned.

743
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,880
And if you're adopting any changes to your workflow.

744
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,880
Have you cursed at Git yet?

745
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,000
I will actually say it's been fairly smooth.

746
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:24,080
I'm in like the first minute of my Git journey, I would say.

747
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:31,600
But there's a great tutorial that I found from a gentleman called Tech with Tim.

748
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,200
And what I appreciate about it is just like super straightforward, and yet really well

749
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,200
explained.

750
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,560
So I'll make sure to link to that as well.

751
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:44,040
I think sitting down and just wrapping your head around how everything interacts is probably

752
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,800
worthwhile before even jumping in.

753
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:50,860
I think the last time I tried to learn it, which I think was about two years ago, I tried

754
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:53,120
to dive into the tooling right away.

755
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:58,400
And because it has its own nomenclature, you know, branches and merging and I don't know

756
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:04,480
if there's like probably 100 of that I don't know yet, but diving into the tooling first,

757
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:10,160
I think was my mistake initially, because I didn't understand the whole concept and

758
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:16,360
how that independence happens and how it all comes together, and how Git relates locally

759
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:21,120
to something like GitHub or GitLab, you know, the other options out there.

760
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:26,280
So I would really if someone's going to dive in, I would recommend learning the concepts

761
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:33,360
first and wrap your head around the nomenclature and then those tools will come super easily,

762
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,680
hopefully like they did for me.

763
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,460
So I'm I think I had some really nice success so far.

764
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:41,520
Hopefully I don't run into some roadblocks that kind of get me frustrated.

765
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:48,440
But what it's meant is that I could do my first pull request on a project within, you

766
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:56,640
know, a few hours of sort of diving in, which feels pretty darn great and has been for me,

767
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:03,020
which I would imagine as many listeners, but kind of a goal is to give back to open source

768
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,420
related projects.

769
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:09,120
And I hope that this is kind of an enabler for me to just keep giving back.

770
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,480
It's that value for value stuff we keep talking about.

771
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:17,280
Yeah, you know, the that's part of the distributed and common nature of Git these days is it's

772
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,920
the sort of lingua franca of being able to interact and to share with other developers

773
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,920
out there.

774
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,640
You got to, you know, once you once you know Git, and it's a tool you can use to help Yeah,

775
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,680
make updates, even if you see those updates until you can actually speak the language

776
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,480
and help the tools share and, you know, interact and make it an easy way that someone can go,

777
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,680
oh, yeah, I can I can accept these changes into my branch.

778
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:41,560
That changes the game and like all good free software infrastructure, you can, you know,

779
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:46,120
you could deploy something like GitLab on your own VPS or on your own LAN and keep it

780
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:49,420
all local and use that and be perfectly happy.

781
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:55,000
You could just use Git on the command line, or you know, you can use something like GitHub.

782
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,480
And there's a lot of a lot of nice tooling built on top of this now, I don't want to

783
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:04,240
step on office hours, because we kind of go in depth in office hours, but the new website

784
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:10,160
will probably use Git for information updates that, in theory, one day, the audience could

785
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:15,840
make a pull request on an episode of Linux Unplugged and add links or make modifications.

786
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,320
And then we could merge that back in.

787
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:22,240
And then we would regenerate the Hugo page automatically with a GitHub action.

788
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:27,520
And it's a way to keep our links relevant and fresh and have people add content.

789
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,120
And, you know, the only barrier to entry, you can be any audience member in the world

790
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:35,160
out there, the only barrier to entry is you would have to know how to interact with Git

791
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,160
and GitHub.

792
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,920
But that's a pretty low barrier to entry.

793
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,040
And it could mean that something like, it's just sort of bringing our production one step

794
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,960
closer to sort of being completely open, modifiable by the audience.

795
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:52,440
And you can use Git and GitHub for tooling for show production, for website generation,

796
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,800
obviously for projects.

797
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:58,240
Well, Casey over in the Mumble Room points out it's not just for developers either.

798
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,360
You can do stuff like a cookbook, say.

799
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,360
Yeah, we've done that.

800
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,040
We've done open your mouth recipes on there.

801
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,400
We also have used it for bug tracking for some of the Jupyter broadcasting stuff.

802
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,400
That's true.

803
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,400
Notes.

804
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,400
It's another area we've used it.

805
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,360
So it's a really powerful tool.

806
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:16,080
And you know, as time has gone on, Linus has kind of changed his tune.

807
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:20,000
He was such a, he was really in cell mode back in 2007.

808
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
But now he doesn't really need to.

809
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,120
In Linux Action News this week, this past week, we covered the fireside chat that Linus

810
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,200
had at the open source summit.

811
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,280
There was a clip in there we played.

812
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:36,600
And he talks, he kind of jokes that in some areas Linus is better known for creating Git

813
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,600
than he is for creating Linux.

814
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,840
And he's kind of joking about that.

815
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,640
And then we cut the clip off.

816
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,400
But I want to play the extended version of that clip because I think it shows you sort

817
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,240
of the transformation Linus has had as a public presenter and sort of a more humble attitude

818
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,240
he takes now.

819
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:57,880
Linux is kind of my baby and I've been doing it for 30 years plus and it's what I do.

820
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:07,240
My oldest daughter, when she went off to college and did computer science, I didn't push her.

821
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:15,840
She emailed me back like a few months, a few weeks later and was laughing at the fact that

822
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:24,400
I was known for Git at the computer science department even though I only did Git for

823
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,400
six months.

824
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:32,320
I mean I'll take credit for it but Git, it's not my baby.

825
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:39,060
It was a side project that I just had to start to actually do Linux development.

826
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:42,560
So all the actually credit for Git goes to Junio Hamano.

827
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:50,720
So if you ever see Junio and you're a Git user, buy him a beer or something because

828
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:56,480
he's been a great maintainer for Git and my name comes up much too often when it comes

829
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:13,080
to Git.

830
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:29,720
So

831
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,280
itself is open source.

832
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,040
It's trusted by millions of individuals, teams, organizations

833
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,120
and many more worldwide for secure password and storage.

834
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,680
And I don't just put passwords in there.

835
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,800
I'll put credit information there for my credit card.

836
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,320
I'll put, you know, like the numbers.

837
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:47,160
I'll put my two factor authentication codes in there.

838
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,720
So that way I can do passwords and two factor autofill.

839
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,240
There's recovery keys I'll put in there for some software

840
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,640
because I really trust the Bitwarden system.

841
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,840
I trust the way they do the encryption, the security.

842
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,680
I love the fact that it's open source.

843
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,880
And I also love the fact that if I ever want,

844
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,200
I could self host it as well with fault warden.

845
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,440
And one of the things that I think gives people a lot of confidence

846
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,560
is that sort of back out option.

847
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,680
Maybe you've already tried Bitwarden,

848
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,280
but you weren't aware of some of the new features.

849
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,640
I wanted to kind of reach out to some of you out there

850
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,720
that are already using Bitwarden.

851
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,200
I want to suggest you try out the new username generator

852
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:20,040
because, you know, I've I've used Bitwarden for a couple of years now.

853
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,840
And I think this is one of the coolest updates they've done in a while.

854
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:26,360
And they've just recently added like the one to punch.

855
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:30,120
And now they can also create email aliases that work with things

856
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,080
like simple login or Firefox relay.

857
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:35,760
You just put the API key in and then they'll generate the username.

858
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,360
They'll generate the password and they'll generate the email address.

859
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,920
All unique to that side of that service.

860
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,160
There's really no better way to manage your security.

861
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,000
That's like the number one thing right there.

862
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,720
You do that and you're just really protecting yourself from information

863
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:53,080
leaks or even malicious types of activity.

864
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:56,840
It's it's like the one thing and it's it's so simple

865
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,600
and so straightforward with Bitwarden.

866
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,520
Even if you've already set yourself up to maybe you have a family member

867
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,600
or a friend or maybe a working environment

868
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,800
that could use a little Bitwarden password hygiene.

869
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:10,760
Send them over to bitwarden.com slash Linux, which is a great way for you

870
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,400
or someone else to try it out for free or for a business.

871
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,520
And of course, support the show.

872
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,480
It's bitwarden.com slash Linux.

873
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,440
Well, the feedback bag is getting a little full in the corner.

874
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,400
We better take a few off the top.

875
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:29,560
And this first one, our buddy Tim from JPL and our favorite Linux copter.

876
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,760
He's got a bit of a correction for us.

877
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:38,440
Linux on the Linux copter is not real time.

878
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:42,920
The kernel is too modified for us to be able to apply the real time patches

879
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,800
to make it more real time.

880
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,600
But as I mentioned in the first episode, the processor is just so dang fast

881
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,080
that not being real time didn't really hurt us.

882
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:56,040
And we also built some robustness into the design to mitigate when it might happen.

883
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,920
I double checked. He's right.

884
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,960
He didn't say it was a real time kernel.

885
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:02,920
Yeah, he said that the hardware ended up being fast enough that they didn't need to.

886
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:08,960
But I just remember being so like blown away by the fact that I was not even

887
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,800
I didn't even consider the fact that, you know, for space operations,

888
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:15,000
they might want a real time kernel. That was really what stuck out there. But it's interesting to know.

889
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,680
It's just a it's not real time.

890
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:20,680
Well, and I think maybe this underscores that the work getting the patch set

891
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:23,920
more into the kernel that's been happening recently means that perhaps in the future,

892
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,680
it won't be so much of a conflict here.

893
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:29,120
You know, as they said, right, they had patches, merge conflicts,

894
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,240
as we're talking about get this episode where they couldn't apply those two things.

895
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,760
So as it becomes more standard, maybe that will make it easier.

896
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:38,120
And even if they don't necessarily need it, but might help by the time they're building

897
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:43,720
the next Linux copter, it might just be. Mainline, you know, we should also mention,

898
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:48,440
Brent, that there is a really fantastic brunch coming up with Tim from J.P.O.

899
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:53,960
Yeah, I got the chance to sit down with Tim a little while ago and record a wonderful conversation.

900
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:57,800
Tim, it sounds like you're probably listening, so that'll come out.

901
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:03,400
I think the weeks of the week of three, four, five July.

902
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,680
We don't know the exact date, but keep in mind that it's going to be a little bit later.

903
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:10,280
We don't know the exact date, but keep your ears open soon.

904
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:13,000
Not this week, maybe next week. We'll see.

905
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,760
And also, there is another episode of Brunch with Brent sitting in the tubes.

906
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:22,360
If you're looking for it, I did a chat with Quentin that got released last week.

907
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,120
So that's worth checking out, too.

908
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:28,040
Extras.show for those right now. Go over there and get your brunch on.

909
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:35,080
Dian wrote in about the Dev1 mentioning, does it come with the BIOS option to limit battery charge

910
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:39,720
to say 80 percent to preserve the health of the battery while it is plugged in for long periods of time?

911
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:43,400
This feature is sadly missing on most cheap laptops.

912
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,640
I do remember seeing a limit somewhere when I was looking at it.

913
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:49,480
Oh, did you? Because I just checked before and did not see one in the BIOS.

914
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:53,000
So it's not in the BIOS, sounds like, which would be really nice to have.

915
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,400
Of course, you could do it with several different projects.

916
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,360
That's probably there. I hadn't really decided how I would do it.

917
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,920
I still use TLP on my on my ThinkPad.

918
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:01,720
Right.

919
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:02,840
That could be one.

920
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,560
Paula wrote in with podcast management between Linux and Android.

921
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,680
I think he's got in the strugs.

922
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:11,320
He says it would be nice and you think it'd be simple, but no, I'm using G Potter and a Tenopod.

923
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:14,280
The G Potter dot net doesn't seem to be very stable.

924
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,800
Do you guys have any suggestions?

925
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:19,640
I think because they're using G Potter dot net for the back end on the podcast.

926
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:24,760
You know, I'm going to toss a link in the show notes for an interview I did with Mitch from Podverse.

927
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:31,720
And you can go to Podverse dot FM and it's a GPL podcast client that's available for Android,

928
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,480
iOS and the Web.

929
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:38,440
And its core feature is that it syncs between all three of those platforms on the Web version.

930
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,960
It does support boosts.

931
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:43,160
The boosts are still in beta development for the mobile version.

932
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:46,200
There are beta versions of the apps floating around that have it, though.

933
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:51,960
But the nice thing about Podverse is that you can finish what you're listening to on your desktop

934
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,880
kind of like you can with Pocket Cast Web.

935
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,360
But it's it's all just sort of inherent to Podverse.

936
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,800
It's sort of the default.

937
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,960
So I did an interview with Mitch, who's the developer.

938
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,200
And I'll put a link to that in there.

939
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:08,360
And you can, of course, search for Podverse in your in your play store or in the Apple App Store

940
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,960
or go to Podverse dot FM.

941
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,160
That sounds too radical.

942
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:14,680
It does look like the back end for G Potter dot net is open source.

943
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,840
So you could consider self-help in that.

944
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:20,200
Isn't there I thought there was a way to also I've never tried that.

945
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,920
I thought there's a way to sync you antenna with next cloud.

946
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,440
Oh, that does sound right.

947
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,720
I'm just not an antenna pod user.

948
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:26,680
So I don't know.

949
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:31,480
I don't know, but if you out there do send us a boost and we'll pass it along because

950
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,800
a lot of people love that antenna pod.

951
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:38,600
And if you could take that thinking and self-hosted, I think that'd be the way to go.

952
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,000
What podcast do you think there's an app in the next cloud?

953
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:41,800
Yeah, that's what it was.

954
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:42,040
Yeah.

955
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,800
So there's a G Potter app in next cloud.

956
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:44,760
That's what it was.

957
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,760
Brent, what podcast app are you using these days?

958
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:48,760
That's a personal question.

959
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:49,240
Yeah, I know.

960
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,640
That's a very I don't know if I want to say.

961
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,600
No, I'm just kidding.

962
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:58,920
Antenna pods, the thing I've been using for a very long time, probably five years, and

963
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:02,760
I haven't felt like changing ever since.

964
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,080
Well, until some of these boost things came out.

965
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:10,760
So I'm secretly hoping that they're sort of boost integration is going to speed up a little

966
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:10,920
bit.

967
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:11,400
We'll see.

968
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,680
But I've been super happy with it.

969
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,960
I will say it does just about everything I want.

970
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:19,480
And now you're adding the sync functionality to that, which is news to me.

971
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,000
So I don't know.

972
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,720
I'm I feel pretty darn happy.

973
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:28,440
We'll drop a link to the next cloud G Potter app so you can just think to your next that

974
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:29,320
I'll say this.

975
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:33,720
Fountain FM recently did an update and they have got me now.

976
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:37,800
It's one of those where I initially with this update, I was like, that sounds like a scam.

977
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,800
I am I am out.

978
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:40,760
And then I started using it.

979
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,000
I'm like, this is the only app I'm using now.

980
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,520
So on my road trip using Fountain FM, I don't know if you can see that brand.

981
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,160
Probably not.

982
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:51,160
I earned 3000 sats listening to podcasts now.

983
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:55,880
So what they've done on Fountain for most podcasts when you're listening, you earn sats

984
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:56,680
in the background.

985
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,920
They do this by two ways.

986
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,920
One, the podcaster can help subsidize.

987
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,680
So like I could incentivize listening.

988
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:07,400
But the way they actually do it is they have just a couple of low key promoted clips that

989
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:11,880
Fountain FM has a really active clips ecosystem where people are clipping podcasts and sharing

990
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:15,800
them and you can follow each other and I clip and share podcasts and a bunch of the audience

991
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,360
follows me and they clip and share their podcast.

992
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:21,960
And I've discovered like a whole new I've got like three or four new podcasts and listen

993
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,960
to on the regular now through this feature.

994
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:27,960
And one of the things they've done is at the very top of Fountain FM, they now have a promoted

995
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,000
they make it really obvious.

996
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,320
These are very clearly promoted clips.

997
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,040
They do stand out.

998
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:32,600
And you know what?

999
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:33,960
They're really not bad.

1000
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:39,160
They're either like, you know, two minutes of a of a podcast or it's essentially like

1001
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:44,600
a host read ad like not your keys, not your coins.

1002
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:50,680
Kasa pairs self-custody with best in class, but I mean, it's not bad, right?

1003
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,040
It's like eight seconds.

1004
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:54,840
And by listening to it, I just earned one hundred and seventy six sets.

1005
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,960
So that's how they're generating the revenue for the sats.

1006
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,280
And then by listening, you don't have to listen to ads to get the sats.

1007
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,400
You can listen to podcasts.

1008
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:05,480
I suppose that does help as a onboarding if you then want to use those sats to send out

1009
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,920
to some of the podcasts you listen to.

1010
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,040
So this is the advantage, right?

1011
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:11,160
It's an open system so I could send them to my wallet and I could just keep them.

1012
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:14,280
But now we've got three thousand sats, I could boost one of the podcasts I listen to.

1013
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,040
Hey, that's a whole sixty five cents almost.

1014
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,840
So it's actually legit.

1015
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,240
I thought it'd be, you know, he's streaming me sats.

1016
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,200
It actually is really good.

1017
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:29,880
I'm going to put my referral link in the show notes because then I get credit for you using

1018
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:30,360
it.

1019
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:33,640
And I'm Chris Lass over there if you want to follow me and hear my clips and stuff like

1020
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:33,880
that.

1021
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,400
You're taking some clips over there.

1022
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:37,320
I'm dropping clips every now and then.

1023
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,120
You know, sometimes Wes Payne says something real insightful and I put it on Fountain and

1024
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:43,640
then the other nice thing about Fountain is once you clip it, you can generate an audio

1025
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:46,920
file, you can generate a video file or you can generate a web link if you want to send

1026
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,080
somebody a link to listen to it.

1027
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:52,760
I just podcasting, it's been missing this and it's they've done a really good job.

1028
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:57,400
And it's actually fun to earn the sats just as listening to shows I would listen to anyways.

1029
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,800
And now I've got three thousand sats I can send to somebody.

1030
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:03,320
And here I am making clips for my family members with Reaper like an animal.

1031
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,520
Yeah, same.

1032
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:07,960
And now it is time for the boost.

1033
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:11,000
Mr. Adam Curry, the Podfather boosted in again.

1034
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,400
He says, boosting for Helipad, pew, pew, pew.

1035
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,120
Helipad is the tool.

1036
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:19,640
It is the tool.

1037
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:22,600
So thank you, Podfather, and thank you, Dave Jones, for working on Helipad.

1038
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:23,160
Indeed.

1039
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:28,120
It is a front end that pulls in all of the boosts and gives us information like what

1040
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:32,280
episode you were listening to, what app you used to send it with all the right information.

1041
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:35,400
What app you used to send it with all the right icons.

1042
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:39,080
It also has a fun confetti and sound effect that it creates.

1043
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,800
It's a real experience and it's a real time updating dashboard.

1044
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,720
So I can leave Helipad up on my screen.

1045
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,840
I think Adam does the same.

1046
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,600
That's what got you hooked right there.

1047
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,040
Yeah, and I just see the boost coming in.

1048
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,560
I just I totally love it.

1049
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,200
It's really great.

1050
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:55,640
412 Linux boosted in five days ago with 500 sats.

1051
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:59,240
This is my vote for the airwolf theme as the stream starter.

1052
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:03,880
Yeah, okay, we've been debating a song inspired by the Podfather.

1053
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,080
Here's what I'm thinking.

1054
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:08,920
I was listening to their live stream and I noticed that they play a song before the

1055
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,840
show every time and it's the same song.

1056
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:15,720
And then I realized like this is genius because it kind of probably gets them in like a mental

1057
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:16,760
head space.

1058
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:17,960
You know, you could be having a bad day.

1059
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,400
Maybe you're fighting a lot of the tech.

1060
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,080
Maybe it's 90 degrees in your studio.

1061
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,000
You forgot a pre-show again.

1062
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,720
And like if you could program your brain to get in the head space every time you hear

1063
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,800
the song, you hear the song and it's go time.

1064
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:30,760
It's showtime.

1065
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:34,760
And so we've been debating in our pre-show what song could we listen to over and over

1066
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,760
again that would get us in the right head space.

1067
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:40,680
And so 412 Linux is he's voting for airwolf.

1068
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:41,480
I want to sample it.

1069
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:44,520
So those that don't listen to the live stream get a little idea what airwolf sounds like.

1070
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:45,720
I'll just play a little bit.

1071
00:54:45,720 --> 00:55:01,720
It's a classic like 80s style television show intro.

1072
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,080
It's pretty good, right?

1073
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,120
It's not great.

1074
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:09,720
It's not epic necessarily.

1075
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:15,320
But I realized wouldn't it be great if we picked a song that had different remixes?

1076
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:18,200
You know, so it has to be popular enough that there's different remixes.

1077
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,400
And you guys, this is where airwolf shines.

1078
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,200
Check out this remix.

1079
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,000
This is killer.

1080
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,160
Little helicopter sound effect.

1081
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:32,540
Right?

1082
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:36,040
Elite podcasters air dropping in to do our thing.

1083
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:37,560
Picture it.

1084
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:40,840
Podcast mercenaries talking about Linux.

1085
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:43,880
Yeah, right?

1086
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,320
Oh, it hits.

1087
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:57,080
Oh, yeah.

1088
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:13,080
Linux!

1089
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:16,120
Yeah, and it doesn't stop there.

1090
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:16,840
I got one more.

1091
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,800
See, airwolf has got one more remix that I think is a serious contender.

1092
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,240
Yeah, synthwave version, baby.

1093
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,360
They even sped it up a little bit.

1094
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:42,440
So I think airwolf could be a contender.

1095
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:47,000
I don't know if it's the right note, but I feel like it's got some serious range.

1096
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:51,880
I do think having remixes available is a strong plus.

1097
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:52,680
That's for sure.

1098
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:53,400
Yeah, yeah.

1099
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,320
And something we should consider in other contenders.

1100
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,240
Boost!

1101
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:01,720
Retro Matt boosted in six days ago with 9,250 sats.

1102
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:02,840
Chris, you got any guesses?

1103
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:04,920
9250.

1104
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,120
9250.

1105
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,600
I feel like it's almost a zip code.

1106
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,080
Is that the right amount of numbers for a zip code?

1107
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:11,800
That's a good amount, though.

1108
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,880
Nope, not the right amount of numbers.

1109
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,400
So I don't know.

1110
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:15,880
Good try.

1111
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:17,080
I don't know.

1112
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:18,920
Retro Matt, you'll have to tell us.

1113
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:19,880
We have zip plus four.

1114
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,080
That's zip minus one.

1115
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:21,880
Right, right.

1116
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:26,040
Maybe it's the last four digits of a phone number.

1117
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:27,720
Or they're soc.

1118
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,960
Yeah, yeah.

1119
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:30,440
They're right.

1120
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:35,640
During my freshman year at RIT, I learned of a band called The New Deal.

1121
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,960
This was also the year I first used Linux.

1122
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:42,200
To this day, I can still remember hearing their self-titled album for the first time.

1123
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:46,520
I've been listening to you guys debate over your new intro song and wanted to suggest

1124
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:49,080
a song called Receiver by The New Deal.

1125
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:53,240
It's off their self-titled album release in 2001.

1126
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,520
I think it's vibe is right.

1127
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:55,560
First boost.

1128
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:55,880
Whoop.

1129
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:57,640
All right.

1130
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:09,400
Tell me what you guys think.

1131
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:12,200
Now remember, you gotta listen to this every time before we start the show.

1132
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,320
It's not the new intro.

1133
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,840
It's the new pre-show start song.

1134
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,960
Gotta get you in the show mood.

1135
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:20,120
And you gotta be willing to hear it like a thousand times.

1136
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:21,640
Imagine we're doing a live event.

1137
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,160
We're sitting in front of an audience.

1138
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,200
We're playing this song.

1139
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:25,640
Okay?

1140
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:26,920
We're gonna use it forever.

1141
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:30,840
You're really frustrated because pipe wire somehow broke on you right before.

1142
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:34,760
I will say, right as I'm about to bail on this song, it drops into a new gear and I

1143
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:35,720
like it again.

1144
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:39,320
So it's about, like, right at this point, I start to get burned out and it's about to

1145
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,600
hit again and then I'm in again.

1146
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:43,320
I can see you burning out.

1147
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,200
I can see you burning out.

1148
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,160
I can see you burning out.

1149
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:46,040
I can see you burning out.

1150
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:46,840
I can see you burning out.

1151
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:47,640
I can see you burning out.

1152
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:48,680
I can see you burning out.

1153
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:49,720
I can see you burning out.

1154
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:50,520
I can see you burning out.

1155
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:56,760
Here we go.

1156
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:57,000
See?

1157
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:58,920
Just as I was done.

1158
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:05,720
I think we'd need to have, like, a phone prop with us so we could sort of, like, pick up

1159
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:06,200
the phone.

1160
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:07,080
Yeah.

1161
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,240
Yeah.

1162
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:14,280
And then if that phone was connected and it sounded like a phone and you could talk

1163
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:14,780
into it.

1164
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:16,440
Hey there, Wes.

1165
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:17,240
How's it going?

1166
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:17,740
You know?

1167
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:22,060
Be a sweet way if you had, like, audience questions too, like, you're, like, hanging

1168
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:24,060
on this, like, old corded plugged in phone.

1169
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:26,140
I don't feel like I could hear it again, though.

1170
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:28,940
I've heard it three times on the stream now and I feel like I'm done with it.

1171
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:29,900
Yeah, I was going to say the same.

1172
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:30,700
It's a good song, though.

1173
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:31,260
I enjoyed it.

1174
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:32,460
I enjoyed it the first time around.

1175
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:33,100
I enjoyed it.

1176
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:38,700
But I noticed that, well, because we are lucky to have this video thing that I'm not trying

1177
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:44,380
not to refer to, but I noticed that we were really getting to it with that Airwolf remix.

1178
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:45,740
And-

1179
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:46,700
That's true, yeah.

1180
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:50,780
I observed that we weren't quite into this this time playing this song around.

1181
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:52,940
So just an observation.

1182
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:53,440
Yeah.

1183
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:55,100
We were dancing.

1184
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:58,620
We are live video streaming over at JupiterTube these days.

1185
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:00,460
Bond boosted in six days ago.

1186
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:01,900
B-O-O-S-T.

1187
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:04,940
Thanks for the in-depth review on the Dev 1.

1188
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:08,460
I wasn't even thinking of it as an option until I listened to the episode.

1189
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:09,180
I've been using Pop!

1190
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:11,580
OS exclusively for around two years now.

1191
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:15,580
I'm waiting for the Lamer Pro update to drop on June 23rd.

1192
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:19,020
I'll compare the two laptops and pick the one that may be my new main computer.

1193
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:20,220
Bond, I was the same way.

1194
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:23,260
I would never have considered buying an HP before this.

1195
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:24,860
No offense to people who enjoy HP.

1196
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:27,660
I just had a bad experience with several hundred of them.

1197
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:29,260
So I would never have bought one.

1198
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:30,780
But this, we've bought one.

1199
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:32,700
So like, there's one right here.

1200
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:33,420
Brett's got one.

1201
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:35,260
Like, yeah, yeah.

1202
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:35,980
Infestation.

1203
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:36,860
They did it.

1204
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:37,980
They actually did it.

1205
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:40,780
Michael B boosted in.

1206
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:43,020
That B must be for boost, surely, right?

1207
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:45,740
Two days ago with $6,000.

1208
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:47,020
Thanks for the review.

1209
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:50,380
I wouldn't consider an HP laptop otherwise as a good Linux machine.

1210
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:51,020
How about that?

1211
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:52,060
OK.

1212
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:53,340
Well, you're not crazy, I guess.

1213
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:53,580
Yeah.

1214
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:57,580
But this is a good point that things can change.

1215
01:00:57,580 --> 01:01:02,220
And surely, some of the partnership with System76 helps get some of those things right,

1216
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:04,380
or at least make sure they don't go too far off course.

1217
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:06,140
It's nice to see.

1218
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:06,940
It is nice to see.

1219
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:12,140
I bet they were really nervous trying to crack that market, too.

1220
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:12,780
I could see that.

1221
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:18,540
Cdubs boosted in with a super geeky boost because he used the Boost CLI tool.

1222
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:19,040
Boost.

1223
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:21,100
That is really geeky.

1224
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:24,940
And he sent 10,101 SATs.

1225
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:26,140
Looks like binary to me.

1226
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:26,700
Yeah.

1227
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:28,140
I wonder if that's a binary message.

1228
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:30,140
There's a couple of bigger boosts in here.

1229
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:34,460
And I just wanted to say thank you, guys, because SATs are on sale right now.

1230
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:36,140
Probably going to be on sale for a little bit.

1231
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:39,980
And we still consider them, you know, they're the same SATs to us.

1232
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:43,100
So this is a great opportunity to boost the dip a little bit.

1233
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:45,980
And if everything works out, who knows?

1234
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:53,820
But in a couple of years, you know, this 10,000 SAT boost may be something that helps the network.

1235
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:57,340
You know, like that could be something that it is a dollar amount that increases over time.

1236
01:01:57,340 --> 01:02:02,140
So you can kind of boost today for something that continues to drive value for a long time.

1237
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:06,620
And that's one of the things I think is the most interesting about using lightning for the value

1238
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:12,060
for value model is potentially there is an opportunity for an audience member to sort of get

1239
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:16,700
some SATs on the cheap, send them to a podcaster, that podcaster or open source project.

1240
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:22,220
They sit on them for a couple of years and, you know, they're worth maybe twice what they were

1241
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:23,260
worth or something like that.

1242
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:24,700
And, you know, what, you're out 10 bucks.

1243
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:26,380
The podcaster gets 20 bucks in a couple of years.

1244
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:29,500
I mean, it's an interesting it's an interesting setup.

1245
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:31,020
It's an interesting setup.

1246
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:31,660
That's all.

1247
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:32,940
I think it's a neat opportunity.

1248
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:35,740
Cdubs writes, boosting the NixOS router project.

1249
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:39,740
I'm going to I'm not going to use it on a Pi, though, but I have a question for you guys.

1250
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:43,500
Do you have a dedicated monitor or mouse for your router setup?

1251
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:50,140
I looked into tinypilotkvm.com and it requires a network, which I might not have where I'm working at.

1252
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:51,660
Thank you for the show.

1253
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:51,980
I think.

1254
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:52,460
Thank you.

1255
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:53,740
Yeah, I don't know what that acronym stands.

1256
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:55,260
T Y F Y C.

1257
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:59,740
We've thought about using like Pi KVM.

1258
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:01,500
Alex and I have talked about that quite a bit on the show.

1259
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,180
Yeah, totally.

1260
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:04,300
I think it is really nice.

1261
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:07,900
What I like to do, at least when we're setting up, is I like to have a table with a monitor,

1262
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:11,420
mouse and a keyboard and a network hub just kind of there for the build.

1263
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:15,500
But then once I deploy it, no, I typically haven't had a monitoring keyboard on my routers.

1264
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:21,900
Yeah, same sort of if I if I'm careless enough that I really break it, then the punishment

1265
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:25,180
I get is dragging a monitor over there, which is not the best system.

1266
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:28,780
KVM would be much, much slicker, but it in practice hasn't been too bad.

1267
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:32,460
And I imagine, especially with the NixOS set up, you know, it's going to be especially

1268
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:33,260
resilient.

1269
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:35,340
I want a serial console.

1270
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:39,500
Yeah, is there a carrier board out there that has a serial console?

1271
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:41,020
I could probably do USB to serial.

1272
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:42,380
That's the way to do it.

1273
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:43,420
That's the way to do it.

1274
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:47,340
OK, but if we get that, that's the only way you're allowed to connect.

1275
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:53,980
Anonymous wrote in five days ago with 360 sats.

1276
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:55,980
Here's some sunshine and confetti.

1277
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:58,860
Thanks for another great episode.

1278
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:04,940
Kostpilin boasted in boasted in with 3690 sats as he do boos.

1279
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:10,460
There's a lot of critical opinions about the Umbral 0.5 release, which we mentioned recently

1280
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:15,100
in their telegram groups, some downgrades of potential security or Bitcoin client versions.

1281
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:17,820
So I've heard a lot of folks that are sad after updating.

1282
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:22,220
I'm still on the old version myself, and I'm looking to manually update specific containers

1283
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:23,580
and maybe do Docker overrides.

1284
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:24,460
Thanks for the show.

1285
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:30,620
Oh, so Umbral is this application platform you can use to self host a lot of really great

1286
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:31,740
open source applications.

1287
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:41,020
Chat apps, Vault Warden, Photo Prism and Bitcoin node and Lightning nodes, and they've separated

1288
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:41,980
them out of separate apps.

1289
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:43,260
And I think there's some growing pains.

1290
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:49,500
You know, I wonder, Wes, what would you recommend somebody backs up before they upgrade something

1291
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:50,140
like Umbral?

1292
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:52,220
So, you know, there's lots of tools.

1293
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:55,500
So it's using Docker containers under the hood.

1294
01:04:56,780 --> 01:04:59,900
What do you the data directories?

1295
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:01,740
I mean, what do you need to back up to be safe?

1296
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:04,540
I almost feel like we should try this after the show and just see how it goes.

1297
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:09,260
See how I see if Umbral might be a motivation for if you don't, if you are using something

1298
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:11,900
like an appliance, maybe you want it in a virtual machine that you can usually, you

1299
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:13,340
know, easily snapshot.

1300
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:14,140
That sort of thing.

1301
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:17,580
Otherwise, yeah, you probably want to look at how it's set up specifically.

1302
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,900
Is it mounting things in directory wise?

1303
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:22,380
Is it just using Docker volumes directly?

1304
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:25,740
I don't actually recall, but that would be a place to start looking.

1305
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:28,620
Yeah, perhaps we'll dig into it.

1306
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:29,980
Break some things.

1307
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:30,860
I like it.

1308
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:33,420
The Golden Dragon wrote in again.

1309

Thank you very much.

Three days ago.

1311

Two, two, two sets.

1312

Small duck row.

1313
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:38,620
Thanks for the double episode.

1314
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:40,060
I'm a duck.

1315

Duck loaded with talent.

1317
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:48,380
Grounded grid boosted in a week ago with 2600 sats.

1318
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:50,940
I'm late, but just installed Nix OS.

1319
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:55,100
Having a config file that defines my system reminds me of my other favorite operating

1320
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:56,700
system, Emacs.

1321
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:59,500
I thought he was going to say FreeBSD because that's what Alan Jude used to go on all the

1322
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:00,380
time about.

1323
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:01,980
You know, I've got that RC.com.

1324
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:03,020
Everything's in there.

1325
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:03,980
He was right.

1326
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:04,860
It's a nice thing to have.

1327
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:06,620
It is a nice thing to have.

1328
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:11,660
I love that Grounded Grid decided to keep doing the Nix OS challenge, even though we

1329
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:12,700
kind of have stopped.

1330
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:14,220
I love that it's continuing on.

1331
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:15,340
I think that's awesome.

1332
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:16,300
Carry that torch.

1333
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:18,620
Grounded Grid also gave us a double boost.

1334
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:21,180
2600 sats.

1335
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:22,540
Thanks for the great Jupiter content.

1336
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:27,020
After listening for several years, I still get excited when new episodes are released.

1337
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:28,380
That's A so sweet.

1338
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:29,820
I think that's a goal, right?

1339
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:30,380
So do we.

1340
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:31,020
Yeah.

1341
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:31,740
Well, we do, don't we?

1342
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:36,860
We are very excited when they publish and they download.

1343
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:38,220
It's a nice relief, actually.

1344
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:40,860
So we agree with you on that.

1345
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:44,140
We also got some thank you boosts.

1346
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:54,220
100 sats from Tim B, 500 sats from User 412, 500 sats from IT Guy 05, and 500 sats from

1347
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:55,740
User 95.

1348
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:58,940
Way better than the User 94.

1349
01:06:58,940 --> 01:06:59,980
Let me tell you what.

1350
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:03,980
If you'd like to send a boost into the show, go grab a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com.

1351
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:05,180
Or maybe you're an antenna pod user.

1352
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:06,620
You love using antenna pod.

1353
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:11,580
You can grab Breeze, B-R-E-E-Z dot technology, and then you just add the podcast in there

1354
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:15,580
and you can send in a boost without having to switch your podcast app.

1355
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:17,980
Or be extra nerdy with Boost CLI.

1356
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:22,220
Our picks this week are kind of on theme.

1357
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:28,140
We had to do the obligatory Get Kraken pick, which is, well, it's a gooey interface to

1358
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:31,660
use GitHub, but do any of us actually use Kraken?

1359
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:32,300
Get Kraken?

1360
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:37,580
I find most of the utility if I'm trying to review like a complicated tree, you know,

1361
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:40,940
like there's been a lot of branches going on or some complicated merges in the recent

1362
01:07:40,940 --> 01:07:44,140
history that I'm trying to review, like just what's happening or what the status of things

1363
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:45,660
are day to day.

1364
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:46,460
No, not really.

1365
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:47,980
Yeah, I found it to be overwhelming.

1366
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:48,940
It was just too much for me.

1367
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:49,500
It's too much.

1368
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:51,340
Too gosh darn much.

1369
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:56,300
But Brent suggested, and I think he's totally right, we should just include the awesome

1370
01:07:57,180 --> 01:08:02,380
Git list, which is on GitHub itself, which just includes some of the best tools for Git

1371
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:02,860
out there.

1372
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:04,140
It's kind of a meta pick.

1373
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:08,620
And we could go in and pick one or two, but the list is worth perusing.

1374
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:12,460
Yeah, send us some boosts about the tools that you liked or what it's missing, something

1375
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:13,020
like that.

1376
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:18,220
Yeah, I'd love some suggestions on what I should use to make it either easier or better

1377
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:22,620
or maybe resources on how to learn best practices, something like that.

1378
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:24,460
Padawan, stick with the command line.

1379
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:25,260
Come on.

1380
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:30,300
If you'd like to join us live, we do the show on Sundays around noon Pacific, 3 p.m.

1381
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:30,940
Eastern.

1382
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:33,340
Our Mumble Room is always up and going.

1383
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:37,820
You get a high quality Opus audio feed and you can jump in and share your thoughts as

1384
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:38,460
we go along.

1385
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:41,580
Details are at linuxunplug.com slash mumble for that.

1386
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:45,340
Jupiter.tube is where we're streaming the video version of the show, and it's available

1387
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:47,420
for replay over there as well.

1388
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:50,940
And last but not least, if you're not checking out Linux Action News, well, then you're

1389
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:52,460
missing on what the heck's going on.

1390
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:53,260
You're missing on it.

1391
01:08:54,780 --> 01:08:56,220
You should probably check it out.

1392
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:57,340
It's probably worth checking out.

1393
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:59,420
Linuxactionnews.com, go over there.

1394
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:01,260
Give it a listen.

1395
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:02,940
We got our matrix chat rooms if you want to join.

1396
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:04,780
There's a LUP feedback chat room over there.

1397
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:09,660
There's a, okay, we got a whole whole rash of matrix chat rooms.

1398
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:10,380
What else?

1399
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:13,340
Well, stay tuned for those exciting new brunches in the extras feed.

1400
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:15,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1401
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:17,500
You could just subscribe to the all shows feed and get all the shows.

1402
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:18,940
That's probably worth mentioning.

1403
01:09:18,940 --> 01:09:20,540
I think that's all the stuff that's worth mentioning really.

1404
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:23,660
I can't really, if I can't think of it, how important could it be?

1405
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:26,540
There's probably more, but I'll just say join us live.

1406
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:27,340
See you next week.

1407
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:30,460
Same bad time, same bad station.

1408
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:31,580
Yeah, good enough, right?

1409
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:33,180
Links to everything we talked about today.

1410
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:37,180
Those are over on the website, linuxunplug.com slash, what is it, 464?

1411
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:38,940
That's how it works.

1412
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:39,580
You just go there.

1413
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:43,500
Episode number, and you go there, and these are the links.

1414
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:44,060
Suspicious.

1415
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:45,500
At least until we screw it up.

1416
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:46,540
Yeah, it's that easy.

1417
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:47,900
Maybe we'll break it one day.

1418
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:51,180
Of course, over there you can find our contact form if you want to send us your feedback that way.

1419
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:55,340
You also can join the gosh darn matrix rooms by the links over there.

1420
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:56,140
That's all there.

1421
01:09:56,140 --> 01:09:58,220
We made it real easy for you, linuxunplug.com.

1422
01:09:58,220 --> 01:10:00,140
A lot of those links should probably be on our main website.

1423
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:04,060
Yes, maybe branch will do a pull request to get that fixed up.

1424
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:05,340
In the meantime, thanks so much.

1425
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:06,460
We'll see who learns what it is.

1426
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:07,020
Yeah, right.

1427
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:07,340
Sure.

1428
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:08,220
Just almost there.

1429
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:09,500
Thanks so much for joining us.

1430
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:30,620
See you next week.

1431
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:48,380
Well, we had ourselves a little bit of a technical challenge.

1432
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:52,140
Our OBS machine overheated during that shutdown.

1433
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:53,260
It is having a day over there.

1434
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:55,740
It did itself a little thermal throttle over there.

1435
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:58,060
Well, we're pushing it harder than ever these days.

1436
01:10:58,060 --> 01:10:58,700
I know.

1437
01:10:58,700 --> 01:10:59,100
I know.

1438
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:00,620
Well, it's because we're doing it's Brent, really.

1439
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:01,900
It's Brent's high quality face.

1440
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:02,460
Oops.

1441
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:03,500
Sorry, guys.

1442
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:04,300
Sorry, guys.

1443
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:06,060
It's that whole photography background.

1444
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:08,460
I had a follow up question for you.

1445
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:10,460
Both, actually, and maybe even the mumble room.

1446
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:14,140
I talked a little bit about my teeny tiny Git journey so far.

1447
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:18,380
But Wes, I would imagine you've been using this for years and maybe even a different

1448
01:11:18,380 --> 01:11:19,100
versioning tool.

1449
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:20,860
And Chris, I'm curious about your history, too.

1450
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:24,060
So could you guys inform me, please?

1451
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:26,620
What's your Git history?

1452
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:32,940
You know, I've dabbled with the GitLab, but I've never had a real use case myself personally.

1453
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:35,980
I've thought about it for my desktop config management.

1454
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:39,100
I thought what a cool setup that would be is like my own hosted GitLab.

1455
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:42,460
And then like I'm checking in my dot files and all that kind of stuff.

1456
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:46,140
And then I started thinking, oh, I could do that with my next config and all that.

1457
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:48,860
But ultimately, I just use GitHub.

1458
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:49,740
I always have.

1459
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:50,700
I used it.

1460
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:53,980
I've been a member for a long time because I had private repositories on there.

1461
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:55,660
And that was sort of the way you did it back in the day.

1462
01:11:56,620 --> 01:11:58,060
And it's always been sufficient for me.

1463
01:11:58,060 --> 01:12:02,700
But I've never used it in like a day to day development practice.

1464
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:08,300
So I'm kind of like, I'm the most casual user possible with that kind of stuff.

1465
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:10,780
Do you interface with it much for the day job?

1466
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:13,500
And is it actual GitHub or using Git?

1467
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:14,940
Is it local stuff?

1468
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:18,860
Well, I use Git locally, of course, and kind of a hybrid.

1469
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:23,740
I do enjoy the support built into VS code is quite nice.

1470
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:28,780
Especially for if you're trying to resolve a tricky merge conflict, rebase, that kind of thing.

1471
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:30,300
The highlighting built in is nice.

1472
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:33,900
But otherwise, often just use the command line client as well.

1473
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:36,380
And then we've got a GitLab hosted internally.

1474
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:39,420
But no, I mean, that's kind of the output of my work.

1475
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:44,620
At the end of the day, it's a merge request or pull request that is attempting to make

1476
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:45,900
changes to a repository.

1477
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:47,260
And that's the way I communicate.

1478
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:50,380
That's the way I exchange ideas and stuff with my co-workers.

1479
01:12:50,380 --> 01:12:52,300
So it's kind of fundamental to my job.

1480
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:55,740
Yeah, it's like the tangible thing that you produce at the end of the day.

1481
01:12:55,740 --> 01:12:56,140
That's it.

1482
01:12:56,140 --> 01:12:56,780
Yeah.

1483
01:12:56,780 --> 01:12:58,300
How many of those have you made?

1484
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:01,500
Between that and, you know, sadly, Jira tickets, that's kind of how it goes.

1485
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:01,980
That's weird.

1486
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:03,500
That's probably so true for so many people, too.

1487
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:05,260
And then maybe that'll be us.

1488
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:09,340
You know, one day when we're done, the end result is going to be an episode that we put

1489
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:11,260
up on GitHub and the details and stuff like that.

1490
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:13,660
And then it goes out and it's a powerful idea.

1491
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:29,020
Ah, the dream.
