00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is BSD Unplugged, episode 34, for April 1st, 2014.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,880
Welcome to BSD Unplugged, your weekly BSD talk show that's too busy getting actual

3
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,160
work done to care about what your silly display server.

4
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,160
My name is Alan.

5
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,160
Get it out of here.

6
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,160
What?

7
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,160
How did that guy get in there?

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,160
No, that's not what we're doing this week.

9
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,160
We're just having a little fun.

10
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,160
Hello, everybody.

11
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,160
Welcome to Linux Unplugged.

12
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,160
Hey there, Matt.

13
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,160
Hey, how's it going?

14
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,160
Oh, good.

15
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,160
You know, it is April Fools, and so this week we're going to stick it to a little bit of

16
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,320
an April Fool.

17
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,600
We're not talking about BSD, but we had to let those guys give us a little bit of a poke,

18
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,600
right?

19
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,220
How great was Alan's intro, too?

20
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,220
Check it out.

21
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,320
Welcome to BSD Unplugged, your weekly BSD talk show that's too busy getting actual work

22
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,880
done to care about what your silly display server.

23
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,880
My name is Alan.

24
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,680
I like his enunciation on actual work.

25
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,400
Yeah, you can feel a little bit of BSD superiority in it.

26
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,840
Well so this week, we're going to talk about somebody that I have actually quite a bit

27
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,840
of respect for.

28
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,360
Not only did I watch him when I was a youngster on ZDTV and then later TechTV, but also I

29
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:39,040
really respect him for what he's done for the podcast industry, quote, unquote.

30
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:45,200
But this last week, this Saturday, Mr. Leo Laporte went on his national radio show and

31
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,120
trashed Linux kind of in a bad way, and he kind of trashed it for things that actually

32
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,660
aren't strengths.

33
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,440
So I want to play those clips, and we'll use that as an opportunity to kind of do a little

34
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,680
FUD debunking here on Linux Unplugged and discuss maybe what he got wrong and maybe

35
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,320
what he could have said instead, because not everything he said was incorrect.

36
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,960
So we're going to discuss that, and then if we have a little bit of time left over, I

37
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,880
want to discuss Ubuntu dropping the Amazon lenses from the default search.

38
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,740
So not in 14.04 necessarily, but starting in Unity 8, whenever that lands on whatever

39
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:24,360
device you run it on, when you search in the dash, it won't by default query Amazon for

40
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,560
shopping results anymore.

41
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,520
Now technically, I don't think it's going to really query any scope particularly, but

42
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,200
it's kind of a reversal on a position that Canonical's had for a while.

43
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,600
So if we have time, we're going to discuss that as well.

44
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,000
But first, Matt, a little bit of business we have to take care of.

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,320
We generated a ton of feedback last week when we were talking about the whole mirror Wayland

46
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,640
situation again, and I got a lot of heat.

47
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,280
People really stuck it to me.

48
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,800
I guess they didn't like it when I went on to rant.

49
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,480
So I want to cover a couple of those things because we got a couple of different, I mean,

50
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:01,600
seriously, it was probably 55, 60, you know, individual emails that address this topic,

51
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,240
and I'm not going to put all of them in the show.

52
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,240
Wow.

53
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,240
Yeah.

54
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,240
Oh my.

55
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,160
We would need a feedback show for our feedback show if I covered all that feedback.

56
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,440
So what we're going to do is, I couldn't even read all of them, although I will try to make

57
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,480
sure to get to all of them before the next Linux action show, but what I want to start

58
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:21,440
with is the few that I did put aside that I thought represented maybe a larger majority

59
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,440
of the opinions.

60
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,760
And our first one came in from Merlin and he says, uh, dear Chris, sorry, Matt, but

61
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,560
this one's for Chris.

62
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,320
Your breathless rage against me really blew me away, but not in a good sense.

63
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,840
I share your views on a lot of the topics, but not on this one.

64
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,760
Even if I would share your views, I would never express them so bluntly.

65
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,040
I am very grateful that Popey was able to react so civil and polite to your rage.

66
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,480
I admire that you try to show both sides of the story, but this time you failed.

67
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,800
Again, thanks to Popey for showing the other side of this subject.

68
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,200
You're very passionate about making the Linux desktop breakthrough to the masses.

69
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,760
You see, we're very close to that point and you are very afraid that something will go

70
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,760
wrong.

71
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,680
You direct that fear to Ubuntu, while Ubuntu is the one, is one of the reasons we've even

72
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,980
gotten this far.

73
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,840
Why don't you have more faith in Ubuntu?

74
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,800
How long until you see that all the dumb choices Ubuntu makes are the kind of choices Linux

75
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,800
needs?

76
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,800
I support Ubuntu completely.

77
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,520
I am part of the community and Ubuntu did not alienate me at all.

78
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,760
In fact, the opposite is true.

79
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,520
Ubuntu is the reason I am excited about Linux.

80
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,880
Ubuntu is the reason I'll stick with Linux.

81
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,920
The direction Ubuntu is taking is the direction I want Linux to go.

82
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,720
With kind regards, Merlin.

83
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,280
That's definitely...

84
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:40,360
So to recap, I think what I'm mainly concerned about is Mirror and Wayland creating such

85
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,160
technical differences at the core level of Linux that you'll have application inconsistencies

86
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,360
across desktops and distros.

87
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,680
Even if it was maybe Gnome on an Ubuntu machine after you installed Wayland or something like

88
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,680
that.

89
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,680
It could still be an Ubuntu base.

90
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,000
Maybe it's Mint and they go with Wayland and they have Cinnamon running on top of Wayland.

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,680
Well, so when you're on Mint with Cinnamon and Wayland, maybe Thunderbird doesn't pop

92
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,680
up a new mail notification.

93
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,520
And when you're on Unity on Ubuntu, you get the new mail notification or vice versa.

94
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,200
That kind of inconsistency, I argued, is once again Linux not bringing its A game to now

95
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,040
a fight that is being dominated by Google and Apple who not only bring their A game

96
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,600
but bring it to a level we have never seen it before in the technology industry.

97
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,160
Now Merlin feels that perhaps, you know, I think what I'm kind of extracting from Merlin's

98
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,280
email is the other distributions, the community as a whole, is never going to have a chance

99
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,560
to succeed entirely on its own.

100
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,600
And you need a standout player to rise above the noise, choose the best, build where there

101
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,400
isn't something that does the job, and maybe perhaps at the cost of the others, but at

102
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,040
least one true Linux will stand alone and have users.

103
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:57,400
The problem is, if you have a long perspective on Linux, and Matt I know you totally are

104
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,940
in this camp with me, when you have the long tail perspective on Linux, you know that things

105
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,260
come and go in Linux.

106
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:08,400
There are some things that have been around for a while, but no distro is necessarily

107
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,840
forever, even if it's maybe still around, it's not maybe as popular as it once was.

108
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:20,080
So to bet everything on one particular commercial entity is sort of negating the benefits of

109
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:26,320
having this open community where things are being developed freely amongst multiple stakeholders,

110
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:33,140
yes I said stakeholders, that is actually, even though it's this weird organic evolutionary

111
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:39,080
growth that doesn't have awesome ass keynotes where we just are blowing everybody away with

112
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:44,560
a great demo, it means that there is this general purpose computing platform that is

113
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,520
being worked on by thousands of people with thousands of different reasons to work on

114
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,800
it, and together in harmony they're moving something incredible forward that's like nothing

115
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,880
else.

116
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,620
And when you silo all of that up into one distribution, you're kind of negating some

117
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,620
of those benefits.

118
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:07,560
I mean that distribution is able to build on top of the shoulders of those giants, but

119
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,080
it's also sending a ton of risk to one particular silo.

120
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,680
What do you think of that?

121
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,160
I think that's absolutely correct, especially when you consider the fact that the biggest

122
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,640
strength that Linux on the desktop has is the fact that there's so many different options

123
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,040
out there.

124
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:28,960
Historically there have been very popular Ubuntu-like distributions that honestly a

125
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:35,160
few people thought were really it, and things change, priorities go a different direction.

126
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,540
Anything could happen, you never know, and to put all your chips in that one basket is

127
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,120
incredibly short-sighted, so I agree with you there.

128
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,000
Now coming back to his original point, I would stand with him in the idea that I'm going

129
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
to wait and see.

130
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,180
I don't necessarily think it's going to completely go to hell until I actually see it do that.

131
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,000
I think that we're maybe jumping the gun just a little bit.

132
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,480
I have faith in Ubuntu to at least give them enough – I'm going to give them a chance

133
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,540
before I completely just write them off as screwing everything up, but at the same time

134
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:07,400
I would agree with you in that putting all your balls in that basket, into one distribution's

135
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,520
basket, is incredibly short-sighted, very, very short-sighted.

136
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,160
I think Colby is going to kind of fall in line here.

137
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,100
He says, hey there Chris and Matt.

138
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,200
I just finished listening to episode 33 and I just thought I'd share my perspective on

139
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,200
this issue.

140
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,280
I agree completely with your assertion that the amateur hour handling of small details

141
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,800
on Linux desktop is a problem for future adoption.

142
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,760
However, while you admonish Ubuntu for making the situation worse, I actually praise them

143
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,000
for getting things done.

144
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,360
I envision the following scenario happening, and I like this Matt, so put on your theater

145
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,360
of the mind cap.

146
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,360
Okay.

147
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,720
He says, imagine a table full of Linux celebrities sitting around arguing about the future of

148
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,720
the Linux desktop.

149
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,040
You've got Gnome and KDE guys, they're going back and forth as they've been for

150
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,080
a decade now, and you've got the GPL 2 and the GPL 3 guys, they're bantering back

151
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,080
and forth.

152
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,280
Of course the video driver binary blob camp versus the open kernel driver camp and the

153
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,240
dev versus RPM advocates are there.

154
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,200
The rolling versus non-rolling release crew and the system D versus upstart folks are

155
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,040
also there, all sitting around yelling at each other about how someone is killing the

156
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,740
desktop Linux.

157
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:11,360
At some point, Canonical pushes back their chair, stands up and says, look, you guys

158
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,020
can sit here and argue about almost literally everything in the Linux ecosystem if you want.

159
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,120
Have that at Haas.

160
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,160
While you do that, we're going to go over here and start building software in a platform

161
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,020
that actual people use.

162
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,260
All of you guys do good work.

163
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,960
But it's a shame that instead of actually accomplishing something tangible, you spend

164
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,600
all this time and energy spinning your wheels in all of these academic discussions.

165
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,240
If you need us, we'll be over there, in the corner, making and selling actual products.

166
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:44,480
Later, AC goes on to say, I too have given up on the greater Linux community and have

167
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,640
adopted a more practical philosophy.

168
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,720
The first group that actually releases something that works and is widely supported is the

169
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,720
so-called winner.

170
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,100
I'll let others have all the academic discussions about the future of Linux desktop because

171
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,440
quite honestly, the only practical Linux desktop that has any chance of doing anything in the

172
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,680
marketplace is to build an ecosystem and build an ecosystem is Ubuntu.

173
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,540
The broad Linux ecosystem is far too fragmented to ever have a chance.

174
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,200
It's always been that way and it doesn't look to change anytime soon.

175
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,200
Keep up the good work.

176
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,720
At this point, Jupiter Broadcasting has a monopoly on my media consumption.

177
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,720
Thanks, Colby.

178
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,720
Nice.

179
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:21,200
You know, and it kind of makes me think back to what Alan was saying there during the intro.

180
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,200
It really kind of brings it home.

181
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,840
You know, it's an interesting point because I think that the unification is going to have

182
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,280
to happen at some level.

183
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,700
That's not to say other distributions can't perhaps come to a group think mentality to

184
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:36,240
maybe where we get two or three that are able to come on board, maybe picking up with what

185
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,240
Ubuntu is doing.

186
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,240
Who knows?

187
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,040
But you know, I've come to the realization that I think Ubuntu, like anybody, is going

188
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,640
to make – as a group, they're going to make mistakes.

189
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:50,840
But historically, again, looking long term, they have been pretty darn good about rectifying

190
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,840
them.

191
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,520
I don't know for my taste, but they do rectify those mistakes.

192
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,520
Yeah.

193
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:00,760
And I think, too, that there's a valid point in actually going off and making something,

194
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:05,320
but I think you have to underscore that the foundation in which they will be making that

195
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:11,720
something under is QT, the Linux kernel, GNU Utils, the GPL itself, the community that

196
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,340
Linux itself brings, the advocacy that that group brings.

197
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,000
It is not something created out of whole cloth.

198
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,120
It is something that is created because all of these groups that he said are arguing with

199
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,440
themselves all the time actually do produce things.

200
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,480
But the thing is, it is certainly seeing the entire – the trees amongst the whole forest

201
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,760
where when you are standing in the forest, all you just see is a whole bunch of trees

202
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,720
right in front of you having fights.

203
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,320
You know, stick fights.

204
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,320
You know, right?

205
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,320
Tree stick fights.

206
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,480
Well, and also, not only that, but I think like QT and all these sort of things, they're

207
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,480
fighting.

208
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,800
You see these groups fighting amongst themselves, and a lot of times, the things they're fighting

209
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,600
over may not make sense to the casual user.

210
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,400
It's lots of low-level stuff that most people are rolling their eyes thinking, God, who

211
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,400
cares?

212
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,400
In reality, we should care.

213
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,400
We've established this.

214
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,720
But again, visually, it doesn't seem that appealing.

215
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,200
It doesn't actually execute the solution right now.

216
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,520
I think people see Ubuntu as coming along and saying, look, we're going to take a

217
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,520
step back.

218
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,520
We'll do our thing.

219
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,920
We'll watch them do theirs, and at the end of the day, we'll probably use what's

220
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,920
best for us.

221
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,920
I think the point I was trying to make last week is that I think that's absolutely reasonable

222
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,320
and a rational position to take.

223
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,800
The flip side is I wanted to argue, and I hope I successfully argue, that there are

224
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:27,040
some components within the Linux user land that our resources are so scarce, and the

225
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:34,560
expertise required to work those things is so high that it can literally be maybe a handful

226
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,840
of people, five, six, a dozen people in the entire industry that know how to do this work.

227
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:47,120
When you split our focus at that level, that split reaches from the beginning of that expertise

228
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,200
to create a display server and reaches all the way up to developers making desktop applications.

229
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:58,160
What it essentially creates is Ubuntu, or let's just call it, it essentially creates

230
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,040
a mirror versus Wayland.

231
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,080
The competition for Ubuntu becomes the other Linux distributions in some sense.

232
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:08,800
Not completely, not outright, because there's still an all rising tide boats thing happening.

233
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,960
But there is a sense where developers will have to make the choice.

234
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,120
What is the primary platform I want to target?

235
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,080
That kind of competition internally is not something that I am fully convinced Linux

236
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,080
can sustain.

237
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,840
However, and we're going to have an email that makes a point about this, I think in

238
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:32,680
the long run it's not going to be as bad as it sounds right now, but honestly the only

239
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,320
way to make it not as bad as we're all fearing it's going to be is to hammer these things

240
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,460
out and figure them out and talk about them and figure out what the actual problems are

241
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,840
in these scenarios.

242
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,580
So that's part of this process in the open source community too is it's a little bit

243
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:49,160
of airing our dirty laundry, but at the same time it's also coming to a group consensus

244
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,160
on this stuff.

245
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,360
Well, I would have one closing thought on it and I would put it this way.

246
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,500
Whatever side of the argument someone may fall onto, the one thing that drives me nuts

247
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,520
is when they take the argument to a low level point.

248
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,740
If it's like, let's say you're pro QT, okay, that's fine.

249
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,520
Show me why not using it breaks blank.

250
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:11,400
Show me, identify exactly where it messes with my life and I think the arguments become

251
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,400
much stronger.

252
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,680
The problem I see within the Linux community is that the arguments are so low level, so

253
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:23,200
bottom of the barrel complicated that the average folks don't care because they can't

254
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,200
identify.

255
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,700
You say, look, you go GTK and this is what's going to break like you brought up with the

256
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:32,400
alerts and things like that as far as not being able to unify that when APIs and whatnot,

257
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,920
all this other stuff, I think you start nailing those individual actionable things to where

258
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,800
you can point to and say, that's going to break because of this, that's going to break

259
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,120
because of that.

260
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,800
Then people like me start to care.

261
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,800
Right.

262
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,800
Then you bring it home a little bit.

263
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,800
Right.

264
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,800
And you know what?

265
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,300
It's the truth for anything that's extremely complicated and abstract.

266
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:54,520
You could make the same argument about NSA spying and anything that's really complex

267
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,520
like that.

268
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,520
That's why no one's complaining about it.

269
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,940
That's why no one complains about it because it's still low level.

270
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:02,800
It may be complicated arguments, absolutely, but at the end of the day, if you don't, it's

271
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,800
not dumbing it down.

272
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,840
You got to identify how it affects things in your life you care about.

273
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,840
That's so important.

274
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,640
You just have to connect it to something that people care about.

275
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,640
Right.

276
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,380
And I'll tell you about something I care about and that is our first sponsor this week.

277
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,380
That is Ting.

278
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:19,600
Go over to linux.ting.com, linux.ting.com is where you want to get started.

279
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,000
And let me tell you, Ting is a mobile service that has zero BS, no contracts, no early termination

280
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,760
fee and you only pay for what you use.

281
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:31,120
Have you ever been on your phone and you've gotten a text message from your carrier and

282
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,440
it's like, hey dog, you're about to go over your data limit, I just wanted to let you

283
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,440
know.

284
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,440
What?

285
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,440
Data limit?

286
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,280
How about you just let me pay for what I actually want to use?

287
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,280
Oh, guess what?

288
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,560
That's exactly how Ting works and it's never been a better time to be a Ting customer because

289
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,560
guess what?

290
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,560
Today, April 1st, Ting has announced the new Ting Android skin.

291
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,560
That's right.

292
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,560
Nice.

293
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,160
Yeah, you see, you can go get yourself a custom Ting carrier skin.

294
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,600
Now by the way, a little bit of a heads up, if your Ting device isn't running Ice Cream

295
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,200
Sandwich, don't worry, the installer will automatically migrate your device running

296
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:07,000
Jelly Bean or Kit Kat over to ICS so you can get that nice downgrade, super smooth.

297
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,160
And if your phone can't run Ice Cream Sandwich, you've got 30 days to buy a new phone if you

298
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,620
want support from Ting, real nice.

299
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,520
And another, they have some developers testing stuff for Jelly Bean, so they might have a

300
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,600
Jelly Bean version out in Q1 2015, so you can check that out.

301
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,600
Here's what you get.

302
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,800
You get the Ting splash screen, you get the Ting music store, you get the Ting app store,

303
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,460
you get the Ting wallpaper store so you can buy wallpapers, you get the Ting ring tone

304
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:34,000
store and of course the Ting remote and the Ting splash screen.

305
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,280
Now Ting music, you get the latest hits from artists of yesterday because Ting, as Ting

306
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:42,920
grows in popularity, they'll be able to sign up more artists, but right now, nobody's using

307
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,320
it so it's all cover bands.

308
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,500
You can download hundreds of songs with it and they're just $2 per song, Ting apps, who

309
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,840
needs Google Play?

310
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,200
Ting has gotten rid of the Google Play.

311
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,520
I've listened to you guys.

312
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,500
The Ting app store offers a huge selection of almost 1,000 apps.

313
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:04,040
You can choose from favorites like MySpace or AOL Instant Messenger, ICQ, MSN Live, Bing

314
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,320
and a few hundred other ones, yeah.

315
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,320
And guess what?

316
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,320
I can get MySpace right on.

317
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,480
You don't have to worry about a credit card map.

318
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,920
They're just going to build this stuff directly to your Ting bill.

319
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,920
Yeah.

320
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,920
Oh, nice.

321
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:19,080
Yeah, and if you want to get a Ting retinal wallpaper, they're called Ting retinals, you

322
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:23,800
can get stunning high-resolution wallpapers to completely customize your home screen.

323
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:28,180
And by the way, more than 20% of songs available in the Ting music store, so that's almost

324
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,080
a dozen, are also available as a ringtone.

325
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,360
So you got to pay like 50%.

326
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,480
I want to get Bieber on that, bad boy.

327
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,080
This is one of the best April Fools ever.

328
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,080
And you know what?

329
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,080
The reason why I love this, because it shows you, Ting knows how much all this crap is

330
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,000
just crap.

331
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,840
They totally see it.

332
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,640
So I thought this is, and apparently a few people in the comments thought this was serious,

333
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,640
and so Ting actually had to make a disclaimer.

334
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,640
Ting is so awesome.

335
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,640
Wow, wow.

336
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,840
So here, listen, this is why I've been a Ting customer, because not only is the Sprint Network

337
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,200
rolling out LTE like crazy these days, they have the Sprint Vision plan, which is awesome.

338
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,440
They've got tri-band LTE, LTE now in 400 markets.

339
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,120
If you haven't checked out the service coverage lately, go over to linux.ting.com and check

340
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,120
out their coverage map.

341
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,640
If you haven't tried out their savings calculator, plug that in there.

342
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,200
Go put your minutes, go put your megabytes and your messages in your bill total and see

343
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,160
how much you'll save over two years with Ting.

344
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,820
And every device you buy from Ting, you own it outright.

345
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,840
That's your device, and Ting's only going to charge you for what you use.

346
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,840
I love it.

347
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,560
So go to linux.ting.com, see what I've been talking about, and a big thank you to Ting

348
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,920
for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

349
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,240
Happy April Fools, Ting.

350
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,240
That's pretty good.

351
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,600
That was great.

352
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,680
So John wrote in, he's got a different angle on this display server thing, so this is one

353
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,280
of two last emails we're going to read here.

354
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,680
He says, hey Chris and Matt, I want to keep this short.

355
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:53,800
The display server problem is proof that Ubuntu is changing from a Linux distro or a Linux

356
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,940
variant to a completely standalone OS.

357
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,760
That's really what Canonical wants, wouldn't you think?

358
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,600
Ubuntu will become closer to what Android is, an OS created from whole cloth.

359
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,420
They have a competitive advantage over basically every other Linux distro, and though it might

360
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:14,480
be cheap, Mirror is one way of ensuring that people don't switch to something else.

361
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,320
So in my opinion, your frustrations are completely valid.

362
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,160
I think the free software world is justified in feeling taken advantage of.

363
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,520
They piggybacked on all of the goodies that Linux provides, and they took a huge chunk

364
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,280
of the user base, and now they're creating something completely different.

365
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,520
This isn't going to cause problems.

366
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,600
Oh, he says this is going to cause problems.

367
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,920
But because of Ubuntu's market share, I think there will come a time that other Linux issues

368
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,640
will be forced to work with Canonical just to stay competitive.

369
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,760
Then again, maybe they crash and burn and Mirror sucks, so they will switch back to Wayland.

370
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,760
Cheers, John.

371
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,760
Cheers.

372
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,040
That's a nice ending, just kind of, eh, whatever.

373
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,960
You know, or it could be completely opposite of what I'm talking about.

374
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,720
Always nice to, you know, you learn from my monkey suit debacle, you know, always keep

375
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,720
your butt covered.

376
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,720
Yeah.

377
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,200
The monkey suit lesson, it lives on in our audience.

378
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,560
All right, our last email on this topic, it comes in from Netlore, aka James.

379
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,560
He says, hey Chris and Matt, I completely failed to get on mumble for the last Linux

380
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,560
unplug.

381
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:14,820
You know, we do loop in our virtual lug, and if you join us live on Tuesdays at 2pm Pacific,

382
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,600
you can take part in that.

383
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,560
He says, because there's a point I wanted to bring up.

384
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:22,240
If there are things which have no, okay, so this is a point he would have made if he's

385
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,720
going to be on the mumble server.

386
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,040
If there are, and this is the point I wanted to kind of hold on to make so he could make

387
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,700
it, because I think this is a great point.

388
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,000
If there are things which have no abstraction, which the applications have to hit the display

389
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,920
server directly to solve, those things need to be abstracted.

390
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:41,200
This in itself will make Linux more mature and quote-unquote better, and it will solve

391
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,000
the issues with all of the machines still running X11, including BSD and Solaris, etc.

392
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,400
For a long time, as we all are going to be solving these mainland mirror issues now.

393
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,840
Not to mention the possibility down the road of X12.

394
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,440
Also, what happens if we go through this again?

395
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,440
Really?

396
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,040
I mean, Linux has always been into playing the long game, and Wayland will be old and

397
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:06,740
obsolete at some point, or maybe just need to be updated, so making sure we abstract

398
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:11,280
all of those functions benefits us now and benefits the maintenance of all display servers

399
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,560
over time and makes it easier to migrate to something new in the future when things change

400
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,560
again.

401
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,640
Finally, it's my understanding that part of the reason MIR was created was a failure

402
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,960
of the Wayland developers to work with Canonical to help them use Wayland.

403
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,040
Surely, if the project alienates one of its largest potential users by refusing to work

404
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:32,360
with them, then surely complaining when they decide that they need to do their own thing

405
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,840
is somewhat disingenuous.

406
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:41,800
Overall, I agree that having this fragmentation will hurt Linux a little in the short term,

407
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,000
but it's already happened.

408
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,880
It's not going to go away, and if we embrace it, we can make Linux stronger, so why not

409
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,880
do that?

410
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,720
I think that's really the best option.

411
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,280
And I know that for the people that actually have to do that work, aka the developers out

412
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,680
there who are raising heck right now, to them they're like, well yeah, screw you guys, of

413
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,680
course you say that.

414
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,600
But in reality, that's kind of what has to happen.

415
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,720
Well, that's kind of what has always happened, I think, at some level.

416
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,720
I don't know.

417
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,040
I mean, I think history will end up dictating how all this works out, but I think right

418
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:16,160
now we just need to focus on the positive, let go of the negative, and let's just see

419
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,160
where it all falls down.

420
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,160
Boombayah, Matt.

421
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,160
Let's see.

422
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,120
Let's make Linux stronger where we can, and we'll keep following it.

423
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,120
You know, as things develop and we start to get a sense of what direction things are going,

424
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,120
we'll talk about it.

425
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,640
You know, and we'll just keep an open dialogue as we go.

426
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,640
There you go.

427
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,640
Oh my goodness.

428
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,640
Uh oh.

429
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:36,400
We have a little breaking news right here on April 1st, 2014, Matt.

430
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,840
I don't know if you caught the headline.

431
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,600
It's taking the internet by storm, but Jupiter Broadcasting announces they have bought Linux

432
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,720
Gamecast weekly.

433
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,560
The new media tycoon, Chris Fisher, owner of Jupiter Broadcasting and Hairstyle Extraordinaire,

434
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:54,040
has reportedly bought Linux Gamecast for approximately $14.4 billion.

435
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,040
Holy cow.

436
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,040
You've been holding out.

437
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,040
Or two Bitcoins.

438
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,040
Yeah.

439
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,040
Yeah, I bought it in Bitcoins.

440
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:04,360
So, oh, rootgamer.com had a little fun today, poking a little fun at us.

441
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,000
I thought that was a great one, those Linux Gamecast guys.

442
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,360
They just got done reviewing the goat simulator.

443
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,360
Have you seen that?

444
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,840
Oh, I was playing it all day today.

445
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,600
As a matter of fact, I tagged then.

446
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,380
Dude, it's like if you've ever wanted to take Barnyard Action and bundle it with Postal,

447
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,380
that's this game.

448
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,400
Now, is this the game where the goat gets a jet pack?

449
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,400
Does he get a jet pack?

450
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,140
Oh, dude, it's like, it's literally, the goal of the game is, I mean, obviously to level

451
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:32,440
up and stuff, but basically, I just run around running people over, bowling them over.

452
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,680
It's literally like Postal minus the shovel.

453
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,360
And you're a goat the whole time, right?

454
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,360
Yeah.

455
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,360
That's crazy.

456
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,360
It's fun.

457
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,360
Oh, my God.

458
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,360
Did you get this on Steam?

459
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,360
No, no, no, no.

460
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,360
I found the executable.

461
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,360
Oh, okay.

462
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,360
I got you.

463
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,360
I got you.

464
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,360
I got your gist, Matt.

465
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,360
I got your gist.

466
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,360
Yeah, my gist.

467
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,360
But yeah, anyway, yeah.

468
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,360
You can do it on Steam, though.

469
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,360
The same principle applies.

470
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,360
You're still going to have to do it with Wine, though.

471
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,120
I want to get to our topic du jour today, but first I want to thank DigitalOcean for

472
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,160
sponsoring this episode of Linux Unplugged.

473
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,160
What is DigitalOcean?

474
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,480
Man, you need to find out.

475
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,720
First of all, we're going to get you two months for free if you use the promo code UnpluggedApril.

476
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,560
Let me tell you why you want to try out DigitalOcean.

477
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:13,760
It's simple cloud hosting dedicated to offering the most intuitive way and easy way to spin

478
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,020
up a cloud server.

479
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,880
Users can create a server in 55 seconds.

480
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,180
I think our audience record right now is 47 seconds.

481
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,640
If you beat 47 seconds, let me know.

482
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,680
And pricing plans, or maybe it was 44, and pricing plans start at only $5 per month,

483
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,680
and this is key.

484
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:33,920
For $5 a month, think about, think about what that, $5, that's less than, that was less

485
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,520
than the KFC I got today on my way back from the studio, okay?

486
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:43,680
$5 a month gets you 512 megabytes of RAM, 20 gigabytes of SSD, a CPU, and a terabyte

487
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,680
of transfer.

488
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,180
That's a quantifiable cost.

489
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:50,760
You know, it's a fixed cost every single month for a tier one cloud server that you have

490
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:56,800
root access over running on Linux on top of KVM and with any distribution you want with

491
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,480
a full-fledged snapshotting and droplet system that lets you deploy applications with one

492
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,400
click, make a backup before you make any big changes, and DigitalOcean has data center

493
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,160
locations in New York, San Francisco, Amsterdam, and Singapore.

494
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,840
Their interface is simple.

495
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,640
Their control panel is intuitive, and power users can replicate that control panel with

496
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,640
their straightforward API.

497
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:20,420
So you want to do a little automation, boom, they got a great API for it, it's beautiful,

498
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:25,920
and listeners of Linux Unplugged can get that $10 credit by using the new promo code, brand

499
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,080
new Unplugged April.

500
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,920
Brand new promo code for this month, Unplugged April gets you a $10 credit, lets you kick

501
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,920
the tires.

502
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:37,920
Let me tell you, I have every single thing I have set up on my DigitalOcean machine,

503
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,480
my droplet, has made that $5 worth it.

504
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,280
And right now, my latest favorite is, we got Rekai working for us now, he's like, Chris,

505
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:49,000
I know you like the Quasl client, I'm like, yeah, I like Smuxy a little bit more, he's

506
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,960
like, well, did you know that Quasl has a server component, I'm like, yeah, I've heard

507
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,960
of that.

508
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,200
He's like, but have you used it?

509
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,040
No, I've never tried it.

510
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:02,360
IRC is amazing, IRC is the legit social network, so now on my DigitalOcean droplet, I have

511
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:08,280
a Quasl connector server that keeps me logged in to several IRC servers and several rooms

512
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,880
related to Jupyter broadcasting at all times.

513
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:18,040
I now can connect from a tablet, from my Nexus 5, from my desktop, from my laptop, from multiple

514
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:22,280
desktops, they all connect back to this one connector, they all share the same login session,

515
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:26,520
all the same nick, I can see all of my messages, I can see anything that transpires since I

516
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,160
connected last time.

517
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:34,160
It has made communicating with our team so much more efficient, I would gladly pay more

518
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,480
than $5 a month for this right now.

519
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,520
And it's one of the many things I have running on my $5 a month DigitalOcean droplet.

520
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,640
Not only that, but DigitalOcean is built on top of those SSDs with tier one bandwidth,

521
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,680
backed by Linux's KVM technology, it completely rocks.

522
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:54,480
So go over to DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code UnpluggedApril to go get yourself

523
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,840
your own cloud server powered by SSD drives, UnpluggedApril.

524
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:08,240
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring Linux Unplugged, DigitalOcean.com UnpluggedApril.

525
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,480
Such a great deal, so powerful, I mean, because you can pretty much do anything you want on

526
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,480
it, it's awesome.

527
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,280
It is, it is, it is so much better than so many other ways you could go, like having

528
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,280
to port forward to a virtual machine, screw that.

529
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:24,020
Just go get an actual cloud server, and man, DigitalOcean is blowing up these days.

530
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:28,880
They're hiring right now, they just got a great round of investments, they've refined

531
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,960
their control panel to a whole new level, it's awesome.

532
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,720
And you know, I heard about them from Michael Dominick from our corner radio program because

533
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,600
they're awesome for developers too.

534
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:43,160
And some of the largest sites on the web are running on DigitalOcean, so it's pretty cool.

535
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:50,000
All right, so I want to get into an area that's difficult, because I have a lot of respect

536
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,320
for Leo Laporte and the TWiT network, and I respect what he's done to legitimize the

537
00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:01,000
podcasting medium, and I enjoyed watching the screensavers back before it was, you know,

538
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
really mainstream.

539
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,280
Like I had a satellite dish, and I was watching ZDTV before they would call it TechTV.

540
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:11,360
In fact, I even saw him a little bit on MSNBC when he was playing, I think it was called

541
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,240
Dash or something, like he was a virtual character, I've been following him for years.

542
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,040
And one of the things that we played on Sunday's live stream was his old interview with Linus

543
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,040
Torvalds, right?

544
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:26,700
So he's given Linux a lot of mentions in the past, and in fact, even on his nationally

545
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:31,720
syndicated radio show that was airing this last Saturday, he did have some sort of fate

546
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,200
praise to give Linux.

547
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,500
Most of the web runs on servers powered by Linux.

548
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,420
That's how reliable it is.

549
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,700
Android phones are based on Linux.

550
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,560
All Android phones run Linux.

551
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,360
That's the operating system.

552
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,780
You're probably using Linux all the time, maybe you don't even know it.

553
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:53,000
So you can get a free version of Linux, there are many as I mentioned, Ubuntu is a good

554
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,440
one, ubuntu.com.

555
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,000
You can download it and install it on your XP machine, you wipe, in fact, I would wipe

556
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,080
out all of XP and just install it.

557
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,360
There doesn't run Windows software very well, it does in fact run it, but not very well.

558
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:15,280
But that's okay because it has an entire office suite available for it for free, LibreOffice.

559
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:19,280
It has all the software, you know, Photoshop clone called the GIMP.

560
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:23,040
There's all the software you'd want is free and available on the Linux platform.

561
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:27,160
So I wanted to play that because you can see he's giving some praise to Linux there.

562
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,240
So the question was, and this is something that's been coming up on his radio show a

563
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:36,040
lot is, look at XP, it goes kaput this week.

564
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,040
What should I do, Leo?

565
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,320
I'm thinking I don't have the money to buy a new machine.

566
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,960
Should I keep XP?

567
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,480
Should I try this Linux thing?

568
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,880
That was the caller's question.

569
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,600
And this is where things went off the rails.

570
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,280
There's all the software you'd want is free and available on the Linux platform.

571
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,280
All of that's well and good.

572
00:29:55,280 --> 00:30:01,000
Here's the downside, and this is why I asked Sy, do you know about computers and he does.

573
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,800
Linux has never really been for real average people.

574
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:11,200
It's really designed by and used by computer enthusiasts.

575
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,440
And so you'll use Linux for a while and then you'll run up against something that's just

576
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,320
weird.

577
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:21,840
And unlike Windows, there's so few people that use it as a desktop operating system.

578
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,720
It's sometimes hard to figure out how to get around these roadblocks.

579
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,160
Things don't work right.

580
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,160
I'll give you an example.

581
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:31,880
Now, before he goes on, I mean, I'm kind of like, okay, I can kind of see where he's going.

582
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:36,360
I don't necessarily 100% agree at this point, but you know, to be absolutely fair, it is

583
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,720
challenging for most average users.

584
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,720
Okay.

585
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,720
So this point I'm giving the benefit of the doubt.

586
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,720
Okay.

587
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,720
All right.

588
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,760
I was running a version of Ubuntu and I decided to use the open source version of Google's

589
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,160
Chrome browsers called Chromium on it.

590
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:54,440
And then I updated Ubuntu, got the newest version and Chromium stopped working.

591
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,280
Just wouldn't, it wouldn't run.

592
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,760
Now I was able to figure out what was wrong and it was a library.

593
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,040
This is the kind of thing that happens with Linux.

594
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:09,640
So I actually watched this happen and if folks who watch a lot of our live shows might remember

595
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,040
I talked about this.

596
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:16,000
I watched Leo got the Dell XPS Sputnik developer laptop.

597
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
You remember this thing?

598
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I remember this.

599
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Yes.

600
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Yeah.

601
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Very clearly.

602
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,960
So I watched Leo on the live stream on like a Saturday or Sunday.

603
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,960
I can't remember.

604
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,640
He was, I think it was after a Linux action show actually.

605
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,100
He was unboxing it.

606
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,600
He pulls the Sputnik out and he boots it up and he's reading his chat room.

607
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:35,040
And before he's even logged into the computer for the first time, and Dell has this little

608
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:40,000
first time setup wizard, the chat room says, Leo, you've got to remove Unity.

609
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,720
Uninstall Unity, app get removed, purge Ubuntu desktop, app get installed, Zubuntu desktop.

610
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,440
And Leo just kind of blindly did it.

611
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,600
And he created a lot of problems for himself when he did that immediately.

612
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,200
He never even gave Unity a shot, he just immediately uninstalled it.

613
00:31:54,200 --> 00:32:00,000
And then, and then the chat room said, Leo, Leo, that is Ubuntu 12.04 on there.

614
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,200
You should upgrade to Ubuntu 13.10, Leo.

615
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,060
Do app dash get dist upgrade.

616
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:07,480
And then he did an app dash get dist upgrade, and this is where he started running into

617
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,480
problems.

618
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,700
Now he never mentions that.

619
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:14,120
And again, this is a use, that kind of use case scenario would never happen to an average

620
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,120
user.

621
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,120
There was a library that Chromium needed.

622
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,200
Remember I was talking about those DLLs, Linux has them too.

623
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,080
There was a library that Chromium needed that the people who make Ubuntu decided didn't

624
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,040
really need to be included in the new version.

625
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,280
So they took it off.

626
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:33,880
So I had to find the library, download a copy of it, put it on my operating system, and

627
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,880
then Chromium worked.

628
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,580
It's not the kind of thing you want to do, and it's certainly not the kind of thing people

629
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,780
who are used to running Windows XP want to do.

630
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:45,080
So my general recommendation is that Ubuntu is a good choice if you're an enthusiast and

631
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:49,520
you like messing around with them, tinkering around with computers, you enjoy that.

632
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,520
It's great for kids.

633
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:56,000
It's a great way for kids to learn how Linux and Unix based operating systems work.

634
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,920
These are the fundamental workhorse operating systems of the whole internet.

635
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,560
So that's a great thing to learn.

636
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,680
But for the average person who just wants to surf a little bit, open the email once

637
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,560
in a while, might not be the best choice.

638
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,600
And of course that's patently false because that's exactly who should be using Ubuntu

639
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,920
or any kind of Linux is somebody who wants to browse the web a little bit, read email

640
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,440
a little bit, do social networking.

641
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,760
And his recommendation is stick with XP, stick with XP.

642
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:29,660
And the problem is, is what he is parroting right there is, think of it this way.

643
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:37,760
Think of a Mac user or maybe a Windows switcher that goes out and buys a MacBook Pro, okay?

644
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,320
And I'm trying to put this in parlance that Leo would understand because he's a Mac user.

645
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:45,240
And he goes out there and he buys a MacBook Pro, he brings it back home, and he immediately

646
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,960
formats the drive and puts Windows 8 on it.

647
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,760
And then he notices, hey, you know what?

648
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,760
This is great.

649
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,400
I've got good performance, but my fans are running crazy.

650
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,560
Like the thermal cooling on this thing really sucks.

651
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,400
MacBooks don't have good thermal cooling at all.

652
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,960
It keeps overheating and shutting down.

653
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,120
MacBooks are awful.

654
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,680
Apple makes bad products.

655
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:10,860
When in reality, he's using the product differently than how it was intended because Apple doesn't

656
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:14,000
make drivers available for Windows for the thermal management system.

657
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,040
So it's down to emergency cooling.

658
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,880
And if you look at that, if you look at what he's done here, he took a product, the Dell

659
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:28,280
Sputnik, he immediately uninstalls with a purge command the Unity desktop, installs

660
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:34,600
Zubuntu, then installs Chromium and does a desktop grading, complains about a library

661
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,600
problem.

662
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:40,040
Now he never says that on air, but then he takes that experience and he says, can't use

663
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,040
it.

664
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,560
Not good for regular users if you just want to browse the web, if you just want to go

665
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,700
out there and do a little Amazon shopping.

666
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,560
In fact, he goes on even further.

667
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,640
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

668
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,640
And you know who you are.

669
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,640
If you're somebody who doesn't want to mess with computers.

670
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,640
I just want to surf the...

671
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:58,940
I just want to buy something on Amazon, send an email to my kids, look at some websites.

672
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:03,600
If that's you, you don't want to mess with it, probably not a good choice.

673
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,160
I think the Chromebooks are a good choice.

674
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,960
I think a new version of Windows would be fine, Windows 8, if you can afford it.

675
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,400
A Macintosh, if you've got even more money, that's a good choice.

676
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,640
It's only for the enthusiasts that I'd recommend Ubuntu.

677
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,520
And the thing that is, and I was going to let this go because we played the clip on

678
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:25,520
the last live stream and I was like, all right, bygones be bygones, water under the bridge.

679
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,360
Sure it was on a national radio show, sure maybe potentially a million people just heard

680
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,780
you kind of crap on Linux for your own mistake.

681
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:39,680
What really bugged me, and maybe this is just a little too inside baseball, what really

682
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:47,560
bugged me is then Twit took the clip of Leo Laporte dumping on Linux and made it the highlighted

683
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,700
clip for that show.

684
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:53,420
So every super long show that Twit does, they release what's called a Twit bit, where they

685
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:57,800
put a couple of minutes from that show on their YouTube channel for Twit, and it's sort

686
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,480
of like, here's the best moment of that show.

687
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,800
And this is what we want you to watch to get you hooked to watch the whole two hour long

688
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,800
show.

689
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:10,320
And this is the moment, this moment where Leo has taken a big stinky dump on Linux is

690
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:15,160
the moment that they chose to highlight from his three hour radio show, because this was

691
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,760
so important.

692
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:21,740
And this is the part that made me angry, because the absolute arrogance and irresponsibility

693
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:26,160
of somebody who has a national radio show, who didn't properly do the work, who screwed

694
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:30,880
it up themselves but is still too arrogant to admit that, then dumps on the platform

695
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,060
as a whole because they screwed it up on their own, applying a use case scenario that no

696
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:40,440
average user would ever do, and then tarnishing the platform as a whole.

697
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,440
That is irresponsible.

698
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,440
And I, that's what upsets me about it.

699
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,560
You know, it's kind of funny too, because those people who he mentioned are, who only

700
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,880
browse the web occasionally and shop on Amazon, are the people who are going to be getting

701
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,000
the viruses and needed protection when he provides, so.

702
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Right.

703
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,880
That's the, that's the thing is that's what has me kind of irked about it is he's actually

704
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,440
in a sense like he's completely got it wrong.

705
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:12,480
Like maybe if that caller was a PC gamer enthusiast or a video editor, like that would be the

706
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,960
person to give that speech to.

707
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:19,800
But somebody who literally wants to read email and shop on Amazon, guess what?

708
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,860
Go get Ubuntu.

709
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,280
It's got Amazon built in.

710
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,280
You know what I'm saying?

711
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,440
Like that's the perfect operating system for somebody who wants to shop on Amazon.

712
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:34,000
It is, it is false on its face and this kind of old school FUD still, I think, is the predominant

713
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,320
narrative that Linux has to combat this.

714
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,880
This is not what he says is not true.

715
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,880
Am I, am I wrong?

716
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,440
I mean, I think what he's trying to say is that it's not good for the average user.

717
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,840
If you're stupid enough to blindly just delete things that you have no idea what they do,

718
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:53,360
but you can say that about any operating system to have like exactly anything.

719
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:57,040
Like why is it that easy to break the library dependency?

720
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:02,040
Like it's in the frequency package manager, you won't, it'll be like, you can't delete

721
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,040
that.

722
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,040
It's required by this.

723
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:08,000
They have an integration package for the Unity desktop for Chromium.

724
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,080
Of course, if you uninstall all of Unity, which Chromium has this nice little integration

725
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:17,440
feature involved, kind of like Gnome has the extensions in the browser.

726
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,200
It's kind of nice and integrated there.

727
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,520
Of course, it's going to kind of blow something up or at least kind of cause us unusual problem.

728
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,880
But it seems like there's an undeclared dependency there that should have resolved it.

729
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,040
The issue is that he's there.

730
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:34,000
He removed the integration features taking random commands from people in a chat room

731
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,720
or whatever and running them on his machine.

732
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,720
Right.

733
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:44,040
But if like, for example, he was, he removed something that Ubuntu created and then he

734
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:49,480
tried to install something that Ubuntu made like from the Ubuntu repo that dependent on

735
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,280
the thing he removed.

736
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,080
So why did the repo just do it?

737
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,080
He did a purge.

738
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,080
He did a purge.

739
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,080
He purged it.

740
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,080
He did a purge.

741
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,080
I don't know what that means.

742
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,080
That means force it.

743
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,080
Regardless.

744
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,080
Like just rip it out of there.

745
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,080
Get it.

746
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,080
I don't care if there's errors.

747
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,080
If you want to kick back a warning to me, screw you.

748
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,080
Pull it out anyways.

749
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,080
Right.

750
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,080
Wait, wait, wait.

751
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,080
Sorry.

752
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,080
Purge means something completely different.

753
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,080
All right.

754
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,080
Hold on.

755
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,080
Okay.

756
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,080
Hold on.

757
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,080
Let's break down.

758
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,720
So Ik, I wanted to get this before we go too far.

759
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,040
I know purge means fully remove.

760
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,040
I know.

761
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:27,560
So Ik, you and I both have experimented with moving our parents over to Linux.

762
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:31,560
What has your experience been with their sort of that average user scenario?

763
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,560
Has this been a problem?

764
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:39,000
Well, the biggest thing about that clip that I wanted to mention is that my parents heard

765
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,280
the clip and immediately they said he was full of crap and my parents are not techy.

766
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,280
That's nice.

767
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,280
And wait.

768
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:53,120
Now, as far as the use case scenario for somebody who just uses Linux to browse the web and

769
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:57,760
do email and write stuff, I would say that that use case would be my wife.

770
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,600
My wife would be the exact use case that Leah was describing.

771
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,120
She has no problem.

772
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:08,960
Of course, I'm there to help her if something goes weird but at the same time, it's not

773
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:15,800
that huge of a deal to just say app.get install Chromium and everything is all better.

774
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,400
My parents, my dad especially, was just like, that is completely false.

775
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,960
He's making assumptions based on stuff he didn't even do any research on.

776
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,320
And he picked up on that right away.

777
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,800
I think this is true.

778
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,920
Now, let's discuss Alan's point.

779
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,040
Alan's point is, you know, maybe the system should be smarter than that.

780
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,760
If you give it the force flag, then that's your fault.

781
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,760
Well, he didn't give it a force.

782
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,760
He gave it a purge flag.

783
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:44,280
But what if the chat room had said rm-rf/.

784
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,440
He could still be blaming Linux for that.

785
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:54,600
I think at the end of the day, he essentially engaged in a scenario in which no user who

786
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:59,600
got a machine pre-loaded with Ubuntu would ever go through.

787
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,600
Unless they knew what they wanted ahead of time.

788
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,800
Well, do you know what he actually hit?

789
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:10,680
It was a dependency in which the Ubuntu package did not declare.

790
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,660
If the Ubuntu package did declare, it would have been resolved.

791
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,920
And it does now.

792
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,600
That has also been fixed.

793
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,600
It was a bug.

794
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,600
You're right.

795
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,600
It didn't declare dependency.

796
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,600
Poppy?

797
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,600
Damn it.

798
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,600
Poppy ruined everything.

799
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,600
Yeah.

800
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:29,160
And like Matt pointed out, I mean, hell, even Kim Commando, though, has been better spoken

801
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,160
in this area on this topic.

802
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:36,760
And I wonder if Leo is just maybe falling subject to just a pervasive narrative that

803
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,560
has just kind of bubbled up through the tech industry for years.

804
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,800
Because I don't think this is even a justified issue.

805
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,240
Yes, there was a bug in declaring that dependency.

806
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:51,720
But again, this isn't something somebody would have gone through normally.

807
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,760
So what can we do to sort of, and I have a theory, but...

808
00:41:54,760 --> 00:42:00,900
The big question is how often does doing the regular updates that you should be doing actually

809
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:01,900
break something?

810
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,900
Very rarely.

811
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,900
Yeah, very rarely.

812
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,900
Very, very rarely.

813
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:05,900
Especially lately.

814
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,560
I guess it depends on someone's definition of very rarely.

815
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,840
It depends on if you rip out your desktop before you try to do an upgrade.

816
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,840
Yeah.

817
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,840
I also run SID.

818
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,800
Running SID even is fine.

819
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,540
And I've been running SID for a long time.

820
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:23,240
It's a little dangerous, but that's even, it's almost not exactly experimental.

821
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,040
But if it's going to be a problem, it's going to be a problem in SID.

822
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,520
And SID is pretty good.

823
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,520
I love it.

824
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,520
I have a question.

825
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,520
All right.

826
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,520
Well, hold on.

827
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,880
I want to give Daredevil, one second, Daredevil, go ahead before we get too far.

828
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,280
Go ahead and make your point.

829
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:41,760
I would actually just give a suggestion to distributions, if anyone is listening, install

830
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:47,720
at least bugs by default and you will solve the most problems you have because the users

831
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,720
see, oh, there's a bug.

832
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,520
I'm not going to update right now.

833
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,680
And that's it.

834
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,620
In FreeBSD, we have something like that called the updating file that explains the problems

835
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:59,720
you will run into while trying to do an upgrade.

836
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,120
And go ahead, Crash.

837
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:07,360
I think part, like this is, this is a problem that the community has though, is that like

838
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:13,200
this guy's made this thing and what the actual issue was, whether it was an Ubuntu issue

839
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:19,360
or a Chromium issue, whatever, is sort of missing the point slightly.

840
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:23,740
Because the real issue here is that hundreds of thousands of millions of people watch his

841
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:26,520
show and get the wrong impression.

842
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,080
And that's, and that's the thing.

843
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:32,720
It reminds me of the, Chris, you probably remember that guy many years ago who did that

844
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,920
thing about, is Linux good for servers?

845
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:41,640
And he installed CentOS and then tried to install Attitude on it and it's exactly the

846
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:45,840
same as that, where the guy has, and then he makes this blog post and everybody reads

847
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:50,460
the blog post and they assume because he's speaking, you know, he's a trusted person

848
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:54,400
that they trust his opinion, they assume that he's correct.

849
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,360
And this is, this is the real thing that we need to be fighting whether or not the actual

850
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:01,120
issue was with Ubuntu or Attitude or whatever, that's, I mean, those are the little paper

851
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,440
cuts that we need to fix as well.

852
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:06,920
But the real issue is that there's a perception, like he says, that it's not for average users

853
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:11,080
when Ubuntu is perfect for average users who probably wouldn't even try to install Chromium,

854
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:14,400
they would just use Firefox because it's there.

855
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,400
Right.

856
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,400
And I, go ahead Riley.

857
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,560
It's kind of funny too, because I remember watching a while back he did a show that was

858
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:29,080
only like repurposing old hardware to use Linux and they did Puppy Linux on it.

859
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,080
Oh, cool.

860
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,440
And they just got the flash drive and they put the ISO on it and they use the unit boot

861
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,440
and they put Puppy Linux on there.

862
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,920
First, you're fine when you need them.

863
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:40,120
Yeah, I mean, he's given good lip service to Linux in the past, but I feel like he's

864
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,120
never given it a good, I don't know.

865
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,120
That actually might be why.

866
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,720
He should know better though, he should know better is the thing.

867
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:49,240
That might be why, because if you look at Puppy, Puppy is awesome, it is great for what

868
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:53,480
it's designed for to get as much as you can out of the hardware, but it is not designed

869
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:57,040
to be completely user-friendly, it is not for average users.

870
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:02,800
People using XD should not be using Ubuntu because their hardware is that old, but Unity

871
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,800
is not.

872
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,200
Well, no, the latest versions of Unity are much more light.

873
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,800
Go ahead, let's give Daredevil a chance to go.

874
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,800
To be fair, most users don't even uninstall things.

875
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,240
If you actually do any maintenance, they don't even uninstall, they just keep installing.

876
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,240
So as long as it works.

877
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,240
Right.

878
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,240
Yeah.

879
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,720
And so, Puppy, I wanted to give, because Puppy, did you try to pop up with something that

880
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,720
we haven't?

881
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,480
Well, so I can see his point.

882
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:35,680
He made a bunch of points that are fairly valid, that it has been for geeks in the past.

883
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:40,960
And it's still for a lot, i3, and you could argue, KDE, very much for geeks, right?

884
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,360
I think GNOME is a geek.

885
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:46,160
I think, and I embrace that too at the same time, like I'm glad there's an OS for me.

886
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,920
But the flip side is, I wouldn't say KDE is only for geeks, no, not only for geeks,

887
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:50,920
indeed.

888
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:51,920
No, no, no, I mean.

889
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:52,920
Windows to make the switch easier.

890
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,000
Oh, I don't mean to make, I don't make KDE to sound like it's only for geeks.

891
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,800
I mean to say, like, it's an operating, it is a desktop environment that appeals to geeks

892
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,800
for a lot of reasons.

893
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,800
Oh, yeah.

894
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,720
The two things that struck me as problems here is one, we shouldn't let users break

895
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:09,440
their desktop in quite that bad a way by typing a couple of commands, by removing, yeah, but

896
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,240
then you're making the Mac, then you're, then it's a Mac.

897
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,880
No, no, there's certain situations that we should not let happen.

898
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:21,120
Like, you know, removing Ubuntu desktop, we try and that we try not to let you do that.

899
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,840
But unfortunately, people do that.

900
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:26,880
And for years, people have removed Ubuntu desktop for whatever reason, maybe they wanted

901
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,520
to rip out Unity or rip out some bits and they remove Ubuntu desktop and the upgrade

902
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:34,800
tool that they when they come to do an upgrade later on from one release to another, the

903
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,800
upgrade tool depends on that being there.

904
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:41,880
And what happens is you end up upgrading and not not installing packages that should be

905
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:46,440
there and would be there if you had Ubuntu desktop there in the first place.

906
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:51,200
The number of systems that I've seen broken that have been fixed by simply reinstalling

907
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:55,960
that package and pulling in all its dependencies and then magically everything's fixed.

908
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:04,600
So the problem that he had was following instructions from clueless numpties on IRC who felt that

909
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:08,040
they were experts in this realm when in fact, they've typed that once and then probably

910
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:13,400
bitched six months later when their own upgrade failed, which was their own fault and nobody

911
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,400
else's.

912
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,400
Right.

913
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:19,240
And unfortunately, that IRC room is always full of fresh fools who are trying it for

914
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,240
the first time.

915
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,240
Riley, you wanted to make a disclaimer?

916
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,240
Um, yeah.

917
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:26,520
Like, Poppy, here's the thought on that, like, why don't y'all put this like whenever you

918
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:30,720
want to add that upgrade, why don't y'all put a disclaimer in it like warning this can

919
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,760
break your system or something like that?

920
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:33,760
We do.

921
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,840
But we don't, we don't recommend this upgrade as a way to go from one release to another.

922
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:41,560
We've got a graphical upgrade tool that tries to do a whole bunch of sanity checks.

923
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:44,640
It's called Update Manager, and it's got a button that you press to upgrade from one

924
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:45,680
release to the next.

925
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,960
And it's got a whole lot of sanity checks.

926
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:53,640
It does things like disable PPAs and check for the existence of certain packages and

927
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,560
it tries to figure out that kind of stuff.

928
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:58,200
If you work around it, we've got to let you work around it.

929
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:02,040
Otherwise, we're giving you a walled garden like an iPad and one big button in the middle.

930
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,160
Yeah, I think people like even like Dave right now, he's I think you guys are missing like

931
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,120
Ubuntu desktop isn't unity.

932
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,760
It's like and maybe this is what people get wrong.

933
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,680
It's like a lot of the bits that make it Ubuntu.

934
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,160
And so that's why when you pull that and that's what he did.

935
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:18,680
I mean, and I go back to there's no I just I again, it's not a real scenario use case

936
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:19,680
scenario.

937
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:23,320
Maybe you should have an Ubuntu should have a feature where when you try to remove it

938
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,640
it says Leo, is that you?

939
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:31,880
What do you think should match it Ubuntu or distros like it?

940
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:34,600
Maybe make it a lot harder for the user to break it like that.

941
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:38,080
Well, that's what the first two things that come to mind on this one, these are the two

942
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,720
important things to keep in mind on this is first and foremost, anybody that's been in

943
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:46,320
technology as long as Leo is concerned, taking advice from an IRC chat room should be slapped

944
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,360
at that level.

945
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:50,600
If it's a new operating system, you're not that experienced with don't take advice from

946
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,600
a chat room.

947
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,600
Just don't.

948
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,760
If you want to take advice from the chat room, that's fine, but then verify it.

949
00:48:54,760 --> 00:49:00,720
Make sure it actually matches the second piece of information is as far as the warnings are

950
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:01,720
concerned.

951
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:07,440
Ubuntu warnings are excellent, but I think that they're a little soft.

952
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,440
You're talking about people as a whole, especially as a community, tend to be pretty boneheaded

953
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:15,800
and unless you make it in big blinking red text, they're going to ignore it.

954
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:22,160
So maybe spice it up a little bit because it is really soft.

955
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,160
I've seen the warnings.

956
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,160
They're not really that compelling.

957
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,400
We talked about this on TechSnap.

958
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,920
There was a study, a university data, about the language used in the warnings and saying

959
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:36,360
this file could be dangerous isn't helpful because it doesn't tell you why it could be

960
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:37,480
dangerous and so on.

961
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:41,800
So saying this upgrade could break your computer and they're like, well, yeah, okay, whatever,

962
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:47,320
whereas it says doing this may cause Chromium not to work.

963
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:53,000
Maybe something more clear like this is how it actually affects you.

964
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
It was like two or three months ago in TechSnap.

965
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,200
There's an actual paper from a university about updating these warnings specifically

966
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,640
they were talking about the ones your browser gives so that people clicking through the

967
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:07,760
warnings and then getting spyware and then being like, why did I get spyware?

968
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:14,100
Because you said I accept responsibility and will take this file that my computer tried

969
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:16,680
to warn me but it did it in such a way that I ignored it.

970
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,640
In general, this is a little bit overblown.

971
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:20,720
This is a little bit over-exaggerated.

972
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:26,200
Yes, it did cause a big problem but this is a package problem that could have been like

973
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,480
it was a tiny problem.

974
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:30,200
It would never usually come up under normal circumstances.

975
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:34,560
Well, Sarah Devlin, wouldn't you argue that maybe the package manager has a role and perhaps

976
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:38,480
we get good information before we install, but what about information before we uninstall?

977
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:43,400
Yes, because I mean, if you were uninstalling the desktop environment, you should say like,

978
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:49,100
all right, you're not going to be able to then have a graphical interface and maybe

979
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:53,480
a little link or description of what actually that means.

980
00:50:53,480 --> 00:51:00,200
So when you're removing Unity, you know what that means and what that will impact.

981
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:06,000
But at the same time, this is also the problem with not having properly curated documentation,

982
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
right?

983
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Yeah.

984
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,760
He's taking advice from the chat room because in general with Linux, the chat room is the

985
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,320
best place to get advice.

986
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:19,000
But if the chat room is an official chat room and not some random Twitch chat room, there

987
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:26,200
are other people there who... if he'd gone into Hashibantu, there is no way anyone would

988
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,760
have told him to sudo apt-get remove Unity and force him to...

989
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,600
I'm going to sit in that channel and tell that to everyone now.

990
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:35,480
You got to understand though that like Leo, that's his IRC room.

991
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,480
He trusts those guys.

992
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,200
You know, he's got regulars in there that he looks at, you know, just like me.

993
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,600
I like my chat room.

994
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:44,320
I got people I take advice from and things like that.

995
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:51,280
So I think what it is is he went into that situation not knowing what to do and people

996
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:56,040
that he knows who's given him good advice before told him what to do and he did it.

997
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:59,680
And then he based his judgment on what happened as a result of that.

998
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:05,660
But maybe moving away from Leo, because like we said, it's a bigger problem overall.

999
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:11,360
I wonder if this isn't exactly why what's happening with Ubuntu and Convergence has

1000
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:15,840
to happen because we have to almost just come at this from a whole new fresh perspective

1001
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:20,600
where we say, yeah, you want to use this because then you can have the operating system on

1002
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,600
one device.

1003
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:25,840
And yeah, it's Linux, but it's this Ubuntu version where they've kind of made this whole

1004
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:28,680
new interface and it works on all your systems.

1005
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:33,040
Like I wonder if we need a reboot of it all together and that's perhaps why Google doesn't

1006
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:37,480
even say it's not a Linux Chromebook, right?

1007
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,480
It's Chrome OS.

1008
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,200
It's a Chrome OS Chromebook.

1009
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:44,720
And I think it's that same exact philosophy there.

1010
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:45,720
Interesting point.

1011
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:46,720
Interesting point.

1012
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,200
I think at the end of the day, a full screen that pops up says you have to you actually

1013
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,200
have to type out the word.

1014
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:55,760
I am an idiot if you install this thing, because literally you're not only acknowledging the

1015
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,620
fact you are, in fact, an idiot, but you're also acknowledging the fact that you are going

1016
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:02,340
to be doing something potentially stupid.

1017
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:03,340
I say that solves all the problems.

1018
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:04,340
That's just me.

1019
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:06,080
Think about all these controversies around.

1020
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:11,680
Think about all the controversy around Mir and how different that makes Ubuntu and how

1021
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,560
I think, I don't know.

1022
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,560
Who knows?

1023
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:19,640
But I would be, if I was a betting man, I would bet in the next year or two, the conversation

1024
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:25,180
around Ubuntu and the desktop is going to switch from all this heat about SystemD and

1025
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:30,360
all that and Mir to, God, all these apps feel like big blown up mobile apps on my desktop

1026
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:33,800
and we're going to go through a period where those get refined for both types of environments

1027
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,000
and I didn't get tons of crap for that for a while.

1028
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:42,120
But I think all of these controversies will build toward this overall narrative that Ubuntu

1029
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:46,760
is different than Linux and so if you've ever had a problem with Linux, well, there's this

1030
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:52,000
Ubuntu one where they went off and they polished off some of these rough edges and they have

1031
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,500
this convergent system where you can get a phone and a desktop and a TV thing and it's

1032
00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:01,000
kind of neat and if you've ever had a problem with Linux where you have this weird software

1033
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,280
problem, well, Ubuntu takes care of all that because they have a software app store just

1034
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:07,840
like the iOS does and only it works on your desktop too.

1035
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,880
It's really cool because you just buy the app once.

1036
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:13,960
Like I could see this, almost all of these controversies are almost contributing to an

1037
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:19,520
end result narrative that almost helps establish the differentiating brand that Ubuntu needs

1038
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:24,120
to sort of break away from all this noise and these old assumptions that old guys like

1039
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:29,660
Leo are making and I'm not saying it's necessarily a good thing, but I almost wonder if at the

1040
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:35,180
end of all of this, all the stuff we're talking about today eventually adds to this perception

1041
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:39,040
that sort of gives Linux a push and gives Ubuntu a push.

1042
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,040
Does that make sense?

1043
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,600
Yeah, I think so.

1044
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,600
I think so.

1045
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:46,320
I, you know, there's aspects of it that have me concerned, but I think the latter point

1046
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:50,300
of, you know, the old way of thinking, the old way of doing things, old, you know, legacy

1047
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,640
way of doing things isn't always better.

1048
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,760
Just because we've been doing it all along doesn't make it right.

1049
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,920
So I think I'm down with that facet of it.

1050
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:03,680
And this also goes back a little bit to that old horse that I love to kick about more responsible

1051
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:04,840
journalism in the sense.

1052
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:13,360
I think, you know, Leo perhaps owes it to his national audience to actually get a Linux

1053
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:16,480
machine for a little while and try it as the vendor intends.

1054
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:21,640
Like I would love, for example, for Leo to get contacted by System76 and give him a whole

1055
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:25,320
inclusive like here's a laptop, well actually, you know, something like that.

1056
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:28,880
I don't know if maybe if he could just try it over with Adele, he already has the machine,

1057
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:32,760
but if it was some sort of here's the whole product, use the product as it's supposed

1058
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,860
to be like, here Leo, like somebody sit down with him.

1059
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:38,900
Like if there was somebody who could go to Twit and sit down with Leo and be like, this

1060
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:42,960
is this, this is that, and not, not, you know, because the problem is I don't want to repeat

1061
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,960
the same scenario that just happened again and have it reaffirmed.

1062
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:54,100
There's only one rule you need to ask him to follow and it's not a vast list of commands

1063
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,100
and tutorials.

1064
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:59,360
Just don't copy and paste dumb commands pasted by idiots on the internet.

1065
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,360
It's really simple.

1066
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:07,760
I know, but I see, here's what I want is I want, I want, I don't, this is now something

1067
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,440
he'll just continue to perpetuate and I think a lot of people do it and I just, I'm trying

1068
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:15,680
to figure out a way we as a community could maybe evangelize like there are, maybe there's

1069
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:22,120
people in our audience that are Twit fans and Linux unplugged fans that could go to

1070
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,960
the Twit studios at some point because they have an open studio and maybe they could take

1071
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:28,120
their laptop there and they could show it to Leo how it's supposed to work.

1072
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:33,040
Like maybe one of the ways we could address, like seriously address some of these problems

1073
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:37,280
is by just getting a little boots on the ground here and using the spread of our audience

1074
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:42,720
to say, Hey, if you ever, ever have an opportunity to give somebody a guided tour, do it.

1075
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:46,960
And it like, I don't know, I think this, this is the problem that he had.

1076
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:47,960
Yeah.

1077
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:48,960
Okay.

1078
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,000
We can talk about why it happened and the bugs and the stupid commands people ran, but

1079
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:59,360
it's a symptom of his mentality that, you know, gung-ho going in and trying this thing

1080
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,360
out.

1081
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:06,840
I don't think that fixing that one guy, despite his large listenership and viewership, I don't

1082
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:11,240
think that fixing that is going to necessarily undo what he's already said.

1083
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:12,640
It'd have to be a lot of people.

1084
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:17,240
I know he's just, he's just an example of a problem that affects, it's a much larger

1085
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,240
problem.

1086
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,840
I think he's well aware of how the system should work, you know, he knows exactly what

1087
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:22,840
should happen.

1088
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:27,600
It's a problem is he has a, he has an immediate perceptive bias of the system when he sees

1089
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,600
it.

1090
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:32,440
It's this immediate assumption he has going in, whereas this, I think he just, I think

1091
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:38,120
he just had a very valid point that the point he was making and he was, he was using a rather

1092
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:42,120
contrived example, but the point he was trying to make was sometimes you get weird error

1093
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:46,720
messages or odd situations that are difficult to fix.

1094
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:47,720
And that is true.

1095
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:54,360
It's probably more true for Linux because people don't know it that way.

1096
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:55,560
I go back to bias.

1097
00:57:55,560 --> 00:58:01,560
The entire, the entire reason Leo Laporte, and I'm not even BSing here, the entire reason

1098
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:06,400
Leo Laporte has a national radio show is because Windows users constantly have problems and

1099
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,020
he can stack a phone bank of Windows users having issues.

1100
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:13,400
So it is a problem that affects every single operating system.

1101
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:17,320
So it is, it is a bias to say it only applies to Linux.

1102
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:21,260
If you, if you, if you F around with your registry on Windows, if you go download C

1103
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:24,960
cleaner and wipe that registry one too many times, you're going to have all kinds of weird

1104
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,560
software problems and all kinds of DLLs that won't start.

1105
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:31,800
This is, it's not you in a ripping out Ubuntu desktop is equivalent to taking a hatchet

1106
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,240
to the Windows registry.

1107
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:38,040
And it is, it, you, you cannot say that it's something that is unique to Linux or something

1108
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,420
is unique to Windows.

1109
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:42,280
And so that's why I say there is a little bit of a bias at play here.

1110
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:43,560
That's not even a little bit.

1111
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:48,360
But the nice thing about Linux is those, the issues that he had, if he just stopped, they

1112
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:52,480
could have been fixed and very easily fixed with a couple of app get commands.

1113
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:56,560
Probably we could have like got him back on track, whereas taking a hatchet to the registry

1114
00:58:56,560 --> 00:59:02,160
is actually quite a hard thing to, to, you know, back out of, but, but all of these,

1115
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:06,800
all of these systems, Windows, Linux, and Mac, they all require experts on hand to help

1116
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,720
you when you get into a tricky situation.

1117
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:14,000
I don't, I don't think Linux requires more experts or it just requires experts with different

1118
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
knowledge.

1119
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
That's all.

1120
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Yeah, exactly.

1121
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,760
And, and I don't know, and I wonder if why maybe if we, if there is some sort of new

1122
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:26,940
magical product category, maybe the perceptions and the, and the biases would be put aside

1123
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:31,120
and they would start a new, they would, you know, maybe he wouldn't feel like he should

1124
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:33,360
just gung ho and go in like a cowboy.

1125
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:36,040
Maybe he'd feel like this is something new that I need to understand and spend a little

1126
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,040
time with.

1127
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,000
And that's a road trip to Petaluma.

1128
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Yeah, I know.

1129
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,440
We should, you know, we should do as a live Linux action show from twit, like while they're

1130
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,440
doing twit and like, that would be funny.

1131
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:49,880
Well, so here's the thing with Leo that most people don't understand.

1132
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:52,360
And I only know of, because I know people that used to work with him.

1133
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:56,960
So let me, let me put this to your point blank at the end of the day, Leo doesn't like to

1134
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:57,960
be wrong.

1135
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:02,640
And so when something goes wrong, you know, I, you know, that's my, that's my impression.

1136
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:03,640
I know.

1137
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:04,640
I know.

1138
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:05,640
Nobody does.

1139
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:06,640
Nobody does.

1140
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:11,240
So I am going to get so much hate mail from our audience for saying anything bad about

1141
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:12,240
Leo.

1142
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:13,240
And I was a nice guy.

1143
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:14,800
I don't want to make this approach.

1144
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:19,720
And the reason, the reason, the reason why we are doing this is a quite literally it's

1145
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:25,280
available in audio B it was on a national radio show in the United States that also

1146
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:29,640
streamed on the internet and listened by thousands of people and then downloaded by about another,

1147
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,540
you know, a hundred thousand people.

1148
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:37,960
And see, it was made to it spotlight special and I, that, that just pulled my irk chain.

1149
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,680
This isn't necessarily about Leo.

1150
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:43,480
Leo is representing a common bias that is out there that many people that may be a lot

1151
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,480
of people even in our audience have.

1152
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:49,600
So I am not trying, I'm not trying to flame Leo, but he, exactly.

1153
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:50,600
He knows better.

1154
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:54,800
And what he really owes, if you're going to, if you're in the position, if you're in the

1155
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:59,080
position of acting as a radio personality on a nationally syndicated radio show, giving

1156
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:06,200
technology advice, I would argue it is perhaps your responsibility to actually have experience

1157
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:10,720
with some of these things before you give such a definitive answer on the topic.

1158
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:17,720
The issue is probably like is, is kind of, uh, goes back to a, every tech person has

1159
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:21,560
the same kind of opinion where they don't want to, if someone asks me a question, they

1160
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:23,920
just don't want to say, I don't know.

1161
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:27,240
They could just, they could say, I don't know, and someone move on and get help.

1162
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:31,760
But we want to say, we want to be helpful even if what we say is not helpful.

1163
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:32,760
Right.

1164
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:35,480
You got to have an answer, especially when you're on the radio.

1165
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:36,480
Yeah.

1166
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:40,640
Just, it's the difference is when I'm wrong, it's a friend of mine having, having a problem

1167
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:44,360
that I have to figure out how to fix it versus millions of people he is never going to talk

1168
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:45,360
to.

1169
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:49,440
However, I would just like to say, I mean, the only, I know Popey made a good point,

1170
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:55,200
you know, like changing Leo's mind in the big picture really is just a drop in the ocean,

1171
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,520
but I actually think it's a drop we could make happen.

1172
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:01,800
So if somebody is in the California area and wants to go up there with a, like a, like

1173
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:07,560
a ultra pro or something like that, or if somebody has a, a nice, uh, you know, a ThinkPad

1174
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:10,360
running a Ubuntu or Linux like that, go show it to him.

1175
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:13,800
Like, uh, go up there Sunday, uh, go after the tech guy show.

1176
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:18,160
So show up about 2 PM and you'll have an hour between 2 PM and 3 PM where he's just screwing

1177
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:21,840
off sitting at the twit table and you can sit down and you can talk to him and you can

1178
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:25,360
show him how to actually use it and maybe you can change his mind.

1179
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:31,800
And maybe next time he's at, well, there you go.

1180
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:35,400
And the next time, and the next time he's, the next time he's on a nationally syndicated

1181
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:39,000
radio show asked, what should I do when I replace XP?

1182
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,640
Maybe he'll have a slightly different answer.

1183
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:44,020
And maybe if you're even comfortable explaining to him what the problem was and, and kind

1184
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:48,720
of where he went wrong, that might help and make it equivalent to, you know, taking a

1185
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:51,380
hack to the registry, make you, he'll understand that.

1186
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:55,240
And I think if we can at least change one voice on the radio, especially at a time like

1187
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:59,840
this, when literally I guarantee it next weekend, it's the weekend after XP support ends, he's

1188
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:02,660
going to get calls asked what I should, what should I do with my old XP machine?

1189
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:06,320
This is a change we could actually make, but I would say a more productive approach is

1190
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:09,680
to just reach out to Kim commando quite honestly, because I think they're about as equal.

1191
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:12,240
They're equally relevant in my mind personally.

1192
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,240
They're both nice people.

1193
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:17,320
I have no problem with them personally, but I, I, I there's things that there's, there's

1194
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:21,160
so much stuff behind the scenes that makes me livid.

1195
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:24,920
It's like, Oh, Leo, this Leo, that Leo's a nice guy, but he's not, he's not the second

1196
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:25,920
coming.

1197
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:29,320
He makes mistakes just like any one of us might and you know, yeah, he's human, but

1198
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:33,240
at the end of the day, let's, you know, I don't, I think it's cool to show him and stuff,

1199
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:37,000
but I think honestly going out and to someone that's actually going to be more receptive,

1200
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,920
I don't think he's going to be as receptive as people think he's going to be.

1201
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:40,920
I really don't.

1202
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:41,920
Yeah.

1203
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:42,920
Maybe not.

1204
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:47,840
Maybe instead of sending someone there, like if someone goes there to teach him how to

1205
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:52,080
use it or show him how we could take it to somebody would do that, but bring their parents

1206
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:55,040
with them and say, here's an actual average user.

1207
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,040
See what happens.

1208
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,040
There you go.

1209
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:58,040
Yeah.

1210
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,040
That would be interesting.

1211
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,040
Yeah.

1212
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,040
All right.

1213
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:02,040
Okay.

1214
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:03,280
Well, so the final thing, or there is one thing that we have to worry about is that

1215
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:10,280
Leo's been lulled into a false sense of security by Steve Gibson because he said he was okay

1216
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:14,920
to run for certain power users who apparently quote unquote know what they're doing.

1217
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:18,720
This is also something I do take a bit of an issue with essentially they're saying XP

1218
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:19,720
is fine.

1219
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:22,840
In fact, you don't even have to have the latest service pack of XP or even the last update

1220
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:25,840
since that latest service pack, all you have to do is don't run as a user.

1221
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:29,980
Well, I can tell you as somebody who has had hundreds and hundreds, literally hundreds

1222
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:37,160
and hundreds of users that I was support for and almost the vast majority, at least the

1223
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:41,440
vast majority of them, I would say almost 90% of them were all running as regular users

1224
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:45,720
on XP had incredible amounts of problems.

1225
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:48,840
Yes, it's running as a regular user is still a good idea.

1226
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:49,840
You know, it helps you.

1227
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:52,500
It keeps like that drive by malware problem.

1228
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:57,240
Like it helps like IE stuff tamps that down, but everyone clean nailed it.

1229
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:58,240
Leo needs a co-host.

1230
01:04:58,240 --> 01:04:59,240
That would be awesome.

1231
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:00,240
I say Stallman problem solved.

1232
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:04,680
The problem is recommending XP, like literally recommending XP over Linux is a little, I

1233
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:06,800
think, I think it's a little almost dangerous.

1234
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:09,800
Oh, it's beyond dangerous.

1235
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:10,880
Yeah.

1236
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:14,680
So anyway, that's why I'm so angry about it just because it's like, it's so irresponsible.

1237
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:17,520
It's one thing if you don't know better, but come on.

1238
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:20,600
But what Gibson said doesn't make sense either because if the power users, even if they're

1239
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:25,640
a windows power user, they're, they are fully aware that they should not be running XP.

1240
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:27,600
Yeah, exactly.

1241
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:32,420
I mean, yeah, this is, see, this is, but okay, but okay, let's put this in perspective here.

1242
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:37,120
This is the level of bias that we're up against that the option is actually for them in their

1243
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:42,440
minds it is a better option to continue using XP for somebody who wants to use Amazon and

1244
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:43,440
check email.

1245
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,200
It is a better option for them to use XP than use Linux.

1246
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:50,860
That is the amount of bias that is out there and that to me seems like a Berlin wall level

1247
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:51,860
of bias.

1248
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:52,860
True.

1249
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:56,820
You know, XP could be secure if you remove all drives, all USB ports and totally disconnected

1250
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:57,820
from the internet.

1251
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:59,560
I mean, it's the most secure operating system in the world.

1252
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:00,560
There you go.

1253
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:01,560
Just run it from Ram.

1254
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:02,560
Never restart.

1255
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:03,560
Exactly.

1256
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:04,560
See.

1257
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:05,560
Yeah.

1258
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:06,560
All right.

1259
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:10,640
All right, guys, I got to go see the electricians at the studio and I, gosh, I hope this didn't

1260
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:12,640
come across necessarily as bashing one person.

1261
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,920
Well, and direct your bashing to me because I'm the one bashing and he's the one sticking

1262
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:16,920
up for me.

1263
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:19,280
So throw it my way because I'll defend it.

1264
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,680
So I think we'll have to bump it to the big show.

1265
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:26,880
I think we'll, we can take more, we'll take more on the topic in the post show, but the

1266
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:31,320
topic we'll have to bump to the big show is Ubuntu makes the Amazon product results opt

1267
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,320
in.

1268
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:33,560
Love to know your thoughts on this one, guys.

1269
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:38,320
So leave us some feedback either in our main subreddit thread where we always post these

1270
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:43,600
shows or you can go over to jupiterbroadcasting.com clicking that contact link and choose Linux

1271
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:44,720
unplugged from the dropdown.

1272
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:47,800
What do you think about the changes coming to the Ubuntu scopes?

1273
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:48,800
Do you care?

1274
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:49,800
Are you glad?

1275
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:50,800
Is it about time?

1276
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:51,800
Is it a huge reversal?

1277
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:52,800
It is outrageous.

1278
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,080
I'd love to know your thoughts.

1279
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:55,080
Just send them in to us.

1280
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:58,680
Don't forget you can join us live on Tuesdays, 2 p.m. Pacific over to jupiterbroadcasting.com

Matt, I'll see you on Sunday.

1284
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:10,480
Download Sabi and load it on your machine and get an opinion, okay?

1285
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:11,480
Okay.

1286
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:13,280
All right, everyone.

1287
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:15,440
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1288
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,840
Join us on Sunday for the big show.

1289
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:22,920
We'll be reviewing Sabi and Linux and then if everything works out as planned next Tuesday

1290
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:23,920
on Linux Unplugged.

1291
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:24,920
All right, everyone.

1292
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:25,920
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1293
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,800
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.
