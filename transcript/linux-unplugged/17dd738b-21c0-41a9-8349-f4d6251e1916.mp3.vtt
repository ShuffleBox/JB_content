WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.960
a robot yes what are we going to do with a robot well astro follow me yeah who doesn't want an

00:12.960 --> 00:18.240
amazon dog following you around your house for just over a thousand dollars their new

00:18.240 --> 00:24.080
alexa on wheels has been announced today it probably runs linux but i don't know if it

00:24.080 --> 00:28.640
even matters i don't care at this point if it runs linux or not i don't want a robot that

00:28.640 --> 00:34.080
follows me in my home i have too many dogs as it is you do have a lot of dogs that's a good point

00:34.080 --> 00:38.800
i would like them to just actually have a program that connects us to dogs how about that let's

00:38.800 --> 00:43.280
just skip the whole robot thing save everybody money yeah quick short term you know prime delivery

00:43.280 --> 00:58.080
dogs hello friends and welcome back to your weekly linux talk show my name is chris my name is wes

00:58.080 --> 01:04.320
hello wes you're coming in looking great today i love that all purple outfit this episode is

01:04.320 --> 01:09.040
brought to you by a cloud guru the leader in learning for the linux cloud and modern tech

01:09.040 --> 01:14.720
skills hundreds of courses thousands of hands-on labs go get certified go get hired get learning

01:14.720 --> 01:21.760
at a cloud guru.com well coming up on the show today it is time for our server crash post-mortem

01:21.760 --> 01:28.400
it struck at the worst time possible and then it crashed again it's been quite the journey we have

01:28.400 --> 01:36.400
talked about our server on the show a lot and this week the chapter is coming to an end i'm a

01:36.400 --> 01:42.080
bit sad but also excited about where we're going we have a major update for you this week but we

01:42.080 --> 01:48.080
will start out by telling you why our arch server crashed recently and then why it crashed again

01:48.080 --> 01:54.000
even more recently that we haven't told you about and then what we're going to do to get things

01:54.000 --> 01:59.200
right to do the right thing here and get going and what we had to do just for now we're going

01:59.200 --> 02:03.280
to tell you all of it it's a full post-mortem today on the show and then we have at the end

02:03.280 --> 02:09.200
a really kind of a fantastic surprise twist we'll tell you about some really big future plans and

02:09.200 --> 02:13.360
on top of all that in case the server stuff isn't quite your bag we've got some nice thought

02:13.360 --> 02:20.080
provoking community news some old friends stopping by the show and a lot more so there is as they say

02:20.720 --> 02:25.200
a big show today so before we go any further let's say time-appropriate greetings to our

02:25.200 --> 02:35.200
virtual lug hello mumble room hello hello hello that is a good-looking mumble room we got 18 of

02:35.200 --> 02:39.680
you in there nice to see you mostly everybody in the on-air room rocking out with us today

02:39.680 --> 02:45.120
so i want to start by asking the mumble room how they feel about a news story that i came across

02:45.120 --> 02:50.960
just before the show started ferronics has noted that the first sign of linux support for what

02:50.960 --> 02:59.040
intel is calling quote software defined silicon are now landing for linux michael writes there's

02:59.040 --> 03:05.360
been talk of intel moving to offer more license able opt-in features for hardware capabilities

03:05.360 --> 03:11.040
found within a given processor and so we are now seeing the linux signs of support coming with a

03:11.040 --> 03:16.560
driver for the intel software to find silicon to allow for secure activation of such features

03:16.560 --> 03:24.240
baked into a processor silicon but only available as an upcharge option yeah michael larable did

03:24.240 --> 03:29.440
some digging on this and kind of makes it clear the basic idea is that without having to purchase

03:29.440 --> 03:36.400
a new processor intel software defined silicon allow for activating additional hardware capabilities

03:36.400 --> 03:41.920
just by purchasing a license or upgrade unfortunately right now the exact details

03:41.920 --> 03:48.320
don't appear to be public for what these upgrades might actually have in them but intel is currently

03:48.320 --> 03:56.160
preparing the linux kernel driver support known as sdsi this driver exposes a per socket interface

03:56.160 --> 04:01.360
so that intel's user space application can provision an authentication key certificate

04:01.360 --> 04:06.720
which is then written to internal nv ram but it also allows provisioning what they call a

04:06.720 --> 04:12.000
capability activation payload and it also handles the boring stuff of just reading out what

04:12.000 --> 04:19.760
configuration the cpu state is right now oh okay so what we have here is this software defined cpu

04:19.760 --> 04:25.600
that allows these hooks for authentication of various add-on packages initially targeting the

04:25.600 --> 04:30.960
xeon line of intel cpus which i think you could probably understand why i'm curious how people in

04:30.960 --> 04:37.760
the mumble room though feel about software defined cpu essentially a piece of hardware that ships you

04:37.760 --> 04:44.000
buy it and there is features and capabilities in that chip that you just don't get access to until

04:44.000 --> 04:49.680
you pay this is not a new concept we have seen this before but this seems like a whole new level

04:49.680 --> 04:55.280
and you could almost kind of see this taking off in a way you know maybe an lte modem that has

04:55.280 --> 05:00.160
extra 5g capabilities if you license those capabilities as an end user you know in that

05:00.160 --> 05:06.480
purchase just 29.99 a month to activate these in cpu or in chip features i mean i think we've

05:06.480 --> 05:09.520
already seen this to some extent with some of those arm boards right where you gotta get a

05:09.520 --> 05:13.840
license to do some of the video encoding or decoding mini mac we're probably seeing this

05:13.840 --> 05:18.560
because intel is going to target businesses initially definitely i see this as a business

05:18.560 --> 05:25.120
feature so probably it's it's just a must that that thing has linux support i don't think this

05:25.120 --> 05:31.280
is really for private users bite didn't they try something like this with itanium yeah so uh hp had

05:31.280 --> 05:39.600
a system where they want to give the cpu a sort of offload of the processor so moving those kind of

05:39.600 --> 05:46.080
functions to the software the software defining what instructions had to be executed and then the

05:46.080 --> 05:53.520
software could just run through all the instruction needed and so thereby creating a more efficient

05:53.520 --> 05:59.360
processor but yeah and you know what happened with the itanium right i mean this whole thing

05:59.360 --> 06:04.160
i'm sort of sitting here going is this what intel is spending their time on right now this is what

06:04.160 --> 06:08.080
they're worried about is licensing additional features instead of just making the absolutely

06:08.080 --> 06:15.120
most kick-ass processors possible and shipping them as fast as possible but the reality is i

06:15.120 --> 06:21.120
think there's like a cold business calculation here because making these cpus they're producing

06:21.120 --> 06:25.760
these things in these massive quantities and it is cheaper and easier to produce if they're all

06:25.760 --> 06:31.440
exactly the same and then they just turn things on and off via software which is not much further

06:31.440 --> 06:35.920
than we are today where they're all manufacturing like say the cpu they're manufacturing tens of

06:35.920 --> 06:42.080
thousands of them and a few of them a core doesn't light up properly or maybe a couple things just

06:42.080 --> 06:49.040
don't pass a specific set of tests and so they will re-bin that as a lower brand cpu oh this is

06:49.040 --> 06:53.760
the this is the four core version instead of the eight core because maybe one core doesn't test out

06:53.760 --> 06:58.000
successfully so they'll disable them several of them and ship it as a four core instead of an eight

06:58.000 --> 07:01.760
core processor when it's essentially the same silicon i mean that is something that already

07:01.760 --> 07:08.000
happens today this feels like an extension of that but there is something i think initially when i

07:08.000 --> 07:14.240
read these kinds of stories as a long time free software user i have this really like screw

07:14.240 --> 07:19.280
licensing you know what like licensing can get the hell out of here i am so sick and tired of

07:19.280 --> 07:25.040
software licensing i would like just no licenses and everybody just essentially operates as if the

07:25.040 --> 07:29.120
gpl were just cultural practice but that's never going to happen but anyways that's but at the

07:29.120 --> 07:34.800
core of me i just don't like licensing and i don't like it in software and i really don't like it in

07:34.800 --> 07:38.800
hardware well it's a reminder that at the root of these computers that we try to fill with free and

07:38.800 --> 07:44.640
open source software is this black box that we you know we don't really have full control over

07:44.640 --> 07:49.360
and it just feels like a little bit kind of you know we've done this huge shift to services and

07:49.360 --> 07:53.040
this isn't quite the same but it feels like it's kind of in that direction of changing the

07:53.040 --> 07:58.400
relationship of i bought this thing it's static and i know what i've got and that's how i calculated

07:58.400 --> 08:02.400
the cost whereas now that's a little more complicated yeah that's totally it that's

08:02.400 --> 08:07.040
totally it we put all this energy and time and thought into the software stack that we run and

08:07.040 --> 08:12.400
try to get it as free as possible and then we have dozens of black boxes baked into our

08:12.400 --> 08:20.400
dozens of black boxes baked into our motherboard that's absolutely part of it oh there was an

08:20.400 --> 08:26.080
interesting steam deck update this last week we talked a little bit about this on linux action

08:26.080 --> 08:31.200
news you probably heard that epic and battle i have updated their anti-cheat software to support

08:31.760 --> 08:38.080
games under proton on linux actually functioning now there's been so many top tier games that linux

08:38.080 --> 08:44.640
users could theoretically technically play because proton was capable of making that game run but it

08:44.640 --> 08:49.840
would fail to run because of anti-cheat software and as we noted on linux action news this week

08:50.640 --> 08:56.480
that has been addressed by both battle eye and epic however game developers still need to patch

08:56.480 --> 09:02.320
their games but no matter how you look at this this is huge news for linux gaming in this last

09:02.320 --> 09:09.280
week this is ginormous news and it immediately means that some of the most popular games on steam

09:09.280 --> 09:16.320
are now theoretically within reach of linux users yeah personally i'm hoping dead by daylight season

09:16.320 --> 09:22.240
updates soon i suppose maybe now is time to reach out and voice our linux user opinions about games

09:22.240 --> 09:27.040
we like and would like to see these updates although hopefully we do it politely yeah i'd

09:27.040 --> 09:30.960
love to see destiny to get support that's what i would love to see and i think that's battle i

09:30.960 --> 09:36.480
but all that aside for the moment we'll just have to wait and see there was one small update from

09:36.480 --> 09:41.680
valve that seemed to have gotten missed in all the anti-cheat coverage but it's one that we're

09:41.680 --> 09:49.200
kind of excited about in the recently updated steam deck faq there are two new questions and

09:49.200 --> 09:55.360
answers that really did stand out the first asks if the steam deck will support booting from the

09:55.360 --> 10:04.480
sd card which valve answers really quite simply yes steam deck supports boot from micro sd that's

10:04.480 --> 10:10.240
great you're going to be able to boot different distros off of the sd card and there was a second

10:10.240 --> 10:15.680
part of the faq that that backs us up the specific question was and this is a quote from the faq

10:15.680 --> 10:21.360
which we have linked what can you tell us about the bios and does it allow dual boot and valve

10:21.360 --> 10:26.880
answered multi boot is supported you can have multiple os's installed and choose which one you

10:26.880 --> 10:33.920
want to put into users will have access to the bios menu what do i even say to this this is

10:33.920 --> 10:41.040
suspiciously open i mean wow huge this means we're going to be able to see community takes on that

10:41.040 --> 10:46.720
that steam deck experience that will have essentially zero barrier to entry i'm very

10:46.720 --> 10:52.000
excited about this like i just i can't overstate it because it's going to allow a lot of people to

10:52.000 --> 10:57.440
participate in creating a software experience for this hardware what if it's too easy though

10:57.440 --> 11:01.760
you know there's no it's not like hacking linux onto a we or something they're almost begging us

11:01.760 --> 11:07.040
to do yeah so i mean really what we have to see here happen is a couple of things we have to see

11:07.040 --> 11:13.680
game developers update their game to support these new anti-cheat updates it looks like it's crazy

11:13.680 --> 11:20.480
easy epic seems to indicate it's very simple they say quote starting with the latest sdk release

11:20.480 --> 11:25.360
developers can activate anti-cheat support for linux via wine or proton with just a few clicks

11:25.360 --> 11:30.960
in their epic online services developer portal that's from epic battle eye says well we already

11:30.960 --> 11:36.640
had linux support but now we've specifically done an update to support proton that's number one is

11:36.640 --> 11:41.840
game developers are going to have to update the game to support this anti-cheat stuff number two

11:41.840 --> 11:47.840
and i'm not 100 but this looks pretty solid from what we can tell you're going to need linux 5.11

11:47.840 --> 11:51.360
so you're going to need a linux kernel or you're going to be able to upgrade your kernel to 511 or

11:51.360 --> 11:56.400
newer because you need a kernel that supports syscall user dispatch which is some work that

11:56.400 --> 12:01.200
was done to make these these anti-cheat other things that are running in wine communicate

12:01.200 --> 12:06.240
better on linux and if you don't have that support it looks like some of this anti-cheat stuff might

12:06.240 --> 12:10.880
not work i haven't able to test that obviously so i can't tell you for sure but from our digging

12:10.880 --> 12:15.920
around that looks to be the case and from what you can tell that seems like that's probably likely

12:15.920 --> 12:24.000
right neil with linux 5.11 collabora on contract with valve made some changes that were upstream

12:24.000 --> 12:31.520
that called syscall user dispatch which provides a way for user space to to register hooks to the

12:31.520 --> 12:38.080
linux kernel for syscall interfaces and apis and things like that this is particularly necessary

12:38.080 --> 12:46.400
for games because a lot of anti-cheat software work by directly calling windows nt syscalls

12:46.960 --> 12:51.040
instead of using like the standard c library and going through user space the normal way

12:51.040 --> 12:57.600
and they would fail in wine because linux doesn't know what that syscall is and they would just

12:57.600 --> 13:04.480
break so what this does is it allows wine to register a handler in linux for syscalls just

13:04.480 --> 13:09.280
like it does for binary format so like when you load in an executive a windows exe file

13:09.280 --> 13:14.240
linux knows that this actually needs to be run by the wine bin loader rather than the

13:14.240 --> 13:23.280
glibc bin loader and so that same process then allows you to run applications that would normally

13:23.280 --> 13:31.360
talk to windows nt directly to then successfully be redirected back to wine for wine server to

13:31.360 --> 13:37.280
handle and the wine fake nt kernel to give it what it expects so that the applications will

13:37.280 --> 13:42.080
run properly that's what's so impressive about all of this right is like the the long-term work

13:42.080 --> 13:47.440
where we got changes actually upstreamed in the kernel to a better enable playing proprietary

13:47.440 --> 13:53.360
games on linux and that valve at the same time negotiated behind the scenes with these anti-cheat

13:53.360 --> 13:58.480
vendors to you know actually get that working yeah and i think it's it's just nice to remember

13:58.480 --> 14:02.320
that collabra is behind the scenes in some of this doing some of the work making some of this

14:02.320 --> 14:07.840
possible at some of the lower levels and you've had valve clearly pulling the strings now for

14:07.840 --> 14:14.080
about a couple of years laying the groundwork this particular groundwork for the deck and

14:14.080 --> 14:18.640
you couldn't look at it necessarily from the outside and see that's where it's going but

14:18.640 --> 14:24.000
now with hindsight it's obvious they were building towards a device now it's just obvious it just

14:24.000 --> 14:27.520
stands out um so that's probably what you need to know is you're probably going to end up needing

14:27.520 --> 14:33.440
a kernel 5 11 or newer um and uh that's you know by the time the deck shipping and all that that's

14:33.440 --> 14:37.280
that's probably not going to be too hard to achieve so that we'll have links to information

14:37.280 --> 14:44.000
about that in the show notes at linuxunplug.com 4 25 but we need to talk about a little community

14:44.000 --> 14:49.840
news in fact something coming up very soon daniel foray joins us from the elementary os project

14:49.840 --> 14:54.880
welcome back hey how's it going it's going really good i'm curious you know i want to talk about the

14:54.880 --> 14:58.960
hackathon that's coming up because it's just in a couple of days but before we get to that

14:59.840 --> 15:04.880
tell us how version 6 is going because i think it's been about a month since elementary os 6 came

15:04.880 --> 15:11.120
out there's been an update how are things shaking out yeah it's been about a month and a half now

15:11.120 --> 15:18.160
since release so we had um we do updates every single month so at the end of uh last month we

15:18.160 --> 15:24.320
did a smaller updates post and we're packaging up all our updates uh to go out now with tons of new

15:24.320 --> 15:30.400
features for online accounts tasks mail app center like everything's getting lots of goodies and i

15:30.400 --> 15:34.160
being dense because i'm sure it was probably it was probably communicated pretty clearly

15:34.160 --> 15:38.560
but i completely missed that there is like a monthly update cadence thing now yeah actually

15:38.560 --> 15:44.480
we started that um last cycle uh and so we're kind of continuing that over but we wanted to

15:44.480 --> 15:49.040
make sure that we're not just pushing out bug fixes and feature updates like every couple years

15:49.040 --> 15:53.920
because it's not a super great experience we want to push them out monthly because then we can get

15:53.920 --> 15:58.080
that feedback loop really tight where you know people are reporting an issue or they're requesting

15:58.080 --> 16:01.760
a feature and we want to get that out to them as soon as possible so they feel more involved

16:01.760 --> 16:05.360
okay well let me ask you this is there anything that stands out in your mind

16:06.400 --> 16:14.320
today that is kind of different or changed since elementary os 6 0 you know version 0.0 shipped

16:14.320 --> 16:18.560
i guess there been anything behind the scenes that has changed in the last 30 days anything

16:18.560 --> 16:23.280
that stands out i mean i think um some of the biggest things are that we're making a lot of

16:23.280 --> 16:29.440
progress with app center with flat pack we've been working with the wider community on some of the

16:29.440 --> 16:34.640
free desktop stuff like with the dark style support across you know all the apps and and so we're

16:34.640 --> 16:41.840
going to be working more on portals and that kind of stuff we kind of redid our ci and cd system

16:41.840 --> 16:46.960
recently so we're now building our flat packs for arm so we're going to have app center

16:46.960 --> 16:52.000
apps building for arm and they're all flat packs now so we're like we're going to have this really

16:52.000 --> 16:58.480
great collection of apps that you can go run on any distro now if you go to appcenter.elementary.io

16:58.480 --> 17:02.240
you can go download those flat packs for whatever distro and we're just going to keep growing that

17:02.240 --> 17:06.480
and make it super awesome wow that sounds rad yeah very impressive that's some serious work

17:06.480 --> 17:11.920
you're putting in that's really cool okay so let's talk about this hacktoberfest live stream

17:11.920 --> 17:17.200
that's coming up isn't it this thursday yeah so uh what's going on with that is that uh it's a

17:17.200 --> 17:22.240
really great time in the cycle right now because you know we just released so it's not really like

17:22.240 --> 17:26.800
the end of the cycle it's like the beginning of our development cycle and so we have a great

17:26.800 --> 17:32.640
opportunity to get people involved and you know try to talk about like what projects we want to

17:32.640 --> 17:39.200
pursue during this cycle and we have hacktoberfest coming up which is the event put on by digital

17:39.200 --> 17:44.160
ocean and github so we're going to do a stream on thursday and we're going to talk about how to get

17:44.160 --> 17:50.560
involved with hacking on elementary os and working on new features and cool stuff like that and we're

17:50.560 --> 17:54.800
going to try to you know tie that into hacktoberfest so if you've never heard of that and you want to

17:54.800 --> 17:58.960
try to get involved you can come find out how you can get some free swag for contributing to open

17:58.960 --> 18:04.640
source projects on github right on but you know it's fall when hacktoberfest rolls around it's

18:04.640 --> 18:09.280
like a milestone of the year so what is an easy place for people to go to get involved if they're

18:09.280 --> 18:14.960
interested and they have some time on thursday if you want to go to our get involved page actually

18:14.960 --> 18:20.560
elementary.io forward slash git dash involved we have links there for all kinds of stuff but

18:20.560 --> 18:25.040
if you want to watch out for our youtube page we have a link to our youtube page on our website

18:25.040 --> 18:29.280
that's where we do our live streams on the last thursday of every month so you're saying if i'm

18:29.280 --> 18:33.520
already subscribed to the elementary youtube channel i'm good to go because of course why

18:33.520 --> 18:38.080
wouldn't i be subscribed yeah exactly and then you can come hang out and do some little q a with us

18:38.080 --> 18:42.960
we got the whole live chat live stream thing going on great well danny thank you for coming on the

18:42.960 --> 18:47.760
show it is always great to catch up with you and it's great to hear things are moving right along

18:47.760 --> 18:52.400
with elementary os6 and it sounds like the hacktoberfest thing is going to be a lot of fun

18:52.400 --> 19:00.320
thanks for joining us thank you and i'll see all you guys on thursday lino dot com slash unplugged

19:00.320 --> 19:05.440
go there to get 100 in 60 day credit on your new account and you go there to support the show

19:05.440 --> 19:12.000
linode keeps getting better i have been a customer for about two and a half years and i can absolutely

19:12.000 --> 19:16.800
testify to this i'll admit though i was watching them for a while you know when these new like

19:16.800 --> 19:22.400
vc supercharged fly by night vps providers came along and were offering all these different things

19:22.960 --> 19:26.320
i sat back and wanted to see what linode would do because you know they're kind of like the old

19:26.320 --> 19:30.880
timer in the linux community they've been around for 18 years i was like are they gonna fumble this

19:30.880 --> 19:34.080
are they gonna get passed up by the new kids or are they gonna stay competitive

19:34.080 --> 19:39.920
and sure enough they they really really have in fact now they're lapping those kids linode just

19:39.920 --> 19:47.840
upgraded their block storage with super fast mvme pcie storage and it screams you can get

19:47.840 --> 19:53.520
systems with amd epic processors that benchmark faster than any other major cloud provider and

19:53.520 --> 20:01.120
pair it with mvme block storage okay it's amazing and then they have 11 data centers you can choose

20:01.120 --> 20:06.480
from and they have become their own isp so they have secured super fast links between their data

20:06.480 --> 20:11.840
centers 40 gigabit connections coming into the hypervisors and then they wrap it all up with a

20:11.840 --> 20:18.320
beautiful easy to use dashboard that lets you get under the hood when you need and i mean i actually

20:18.320 --> 20:25.440
have a linode that i completely replaced the image that they ship with it like i wiped the box and i

20:25.440 --> 20:33.120
put a custom linux distro from a router vendor to create an lte mesh vpn endpoint and they actually

20:33.120 --> 20:39.200
linode actually let me like wipe it off and set up my own custom box there and now the crazy cats

20:39.200 --> 20:44.560
are launching bare metal servers if you really need like just the ultimate performance and it

20:44.560 --> 20:48.800
doesn't matter if you've never set up a box before because they've got easy one-click deployments so

20:48.800 --> 20:53.040
say maybe you're ready to switch to next cloud they got a one-click deployment for that or maybe

20:53.040 --> 20:57.920
something just like a little more like in between like are you done using zoom and you'd like to

20:57.920 --> 21:02.080
use something you can trust and open source they've got a one-click deployment for jitsi

21:02.080 --> 21:08.240
and there's really no excuse and they're 30 to 50 cheaper than the big duopoly hyperscalers you

21:08.240 --> 21:13.520
can get like a five dollar a month box that runs jitsi that's a pretty justifiable business expense

21:13.520 --> 21:19.440
in my opinion but i i really encourage you to go play turn it up to 11 because you can get a hundred

21:19.440 --> 21:24.800
dollars that and when you look at their pricing that's that's incredible that really is great so

21:24.800 --> 21:28.960
go try it out i can tell you all about it all day long but you need to go see it for yourself and

21:28.960 --> 21:33.360
you can support the show it's an opportunity to go play learn and support the show you can call it

21:33.360 --> 21:38.080
like the trifecta of awesome so just head over to linode.com slash unplugged get a hundred dollars

21:38.080 --> 21:43.600
for your new account and try all this stuff out build something learn something test something

21:43.600 --> 21:48.640
there are a lot of ways you can host i admit it there's a lot of them out there and there is some

21:48.640 --> 21:55.040
big big hyperscalers that they'd love you to just put everything you own into their systems but

21:55.040 --> 22:00.800
nobody does it like linode that's why they've been around 18 years and that's why i completely

22:00.800 --> 22:07.280
recommend them go see why we choose linode every single time by going to linode.com slash unplugged

22:09.520 --> 22:13.200
there's a few things i'd like to mention in the housekeeping section first of all thank you to our

22:13.200 --> 22:20.160
members over at unpluggedcore.com the live stream feed has just been delivering mr roach joined us

22:20.160 --> 22:24.080
in the mumble room and told us about his time interning at pixar and about the linux boxes

22:24.080 --> 22:29.120
there that was awesome we had so many great conversations that's available to our members

22:29.120 --> 22:35.120
in the totally uncut bootleg feed we also create a limited ad version that's the same type production

22:35.120 --> 22:40.000
just a little bit shorter and you support the show at unpluggedcore.com i also wanted to let

22:40.000 --> 22:44.960
you know that our buddy joe has a new show a new member of the late night linux family it's called

22:44.960 --> 22:50.880
linux after dark go check it out it's in your favorite podcast catcher already episode one

22:50.880 --> 22:56.640
is already out i'd also like to encourage you to join our luck plug it happens every single

22:56.640 --> 23:01.520
sunday at noon pacific in our mumble room right there in the lobby you can figure it out at your

23:01.520 --> 23:07.280
time zone at jupiter broadcasting dot com slash calendar and all of our mumble info is at linux

23:07.280 --> 23:13.200
unplug.com slash mumble and the nice thing is you get it set up if you're ever around on a tuesday

23:13.200 --> 23:18.480
you can come join us and hang out in the show and get your word in on uh your weekly linux talk

23:18.480 --> 23:25.760
show that's linux unplug.com slash mumble for that okay wes i i know we've talked a lot about

23:25.760 --> 23:30.080
the server recently but this is kind of you know it's what's happening right now and there's some

23:30.080 --> 23:34.960
big stuff in the works you think it's okay if we just maybe one more time touch on this subject

23:34.960 --> 23:39.440
well we have to right it's clearly becoming an issue and the audience needs a resolution

23:40.400 --> 23:45.600
we need a resolution too well yeah that too so just in case you haven't caught previous coverage

23:45.600 --> 23:50.000
just super briefly our goal with this arch server that we have here in our studio has been a bit of

23:50.000 --> 23:55.360
a long-term experiment i think you know too often you'll see online reviewers who spend 30 or

23:55.920 --> 24:01.760
40 minutes with something if that and then they go make their video or their blog or whatever

24:01.760 --> 24:05.840
maybe it's just a forum post somebody you know talking smart in a forum giving you their opinion

24:05.840 --> 24:10.000
people speak with authority after they try something for a little bit they kind of they

24:10.000 --> 24:14.400
because they speak with authority to it it kind of gets accepted as maybe expert opinion

24:14.400 --> 24:16.880
and then before you know it it's all over the entire internet as fact

24:18.160 --> 24:24.480
and so we love pushing back against that kind of stuff and we also know that how something holds

24:24.480 --> 24:31.040
up long term is a totally different story than how something is during your first impressions

24:31.040 --> 24:36.800
right i've been like i'm i'm already preparing myself for our fedora 35 review because i've

24:36.800 --> 24:42.720
been running fedora 35 for the last two weeks so that by the time it ships in a month i'm gonna

24:42.720 --> 24:47.520
have a pretty rounded opinion of that distribution and some of it will be you know it's during it's

24:47.520 --> 24:52.240
a beta cycle but some of it's like i'm a forming opinion now about gnome 41 and i i truly believe

24:52.240 --> 24:56.880
whenever we can we try to really experience something as long as possible and when we can't

24:56.880 --> 25:00.240
we come right off and we'll tell you hey man this is a first this is a first

25:00.240 --> 25:05.040
opinion you know first impressions kind of thing with this server we wanted to try actually running

25:05.040 --> 25:10.000
arch in production for an extended period of time and see if we could make a few tweaks to make it

25:10.000 --> 25:16.800
keep running like you know using the lts kernel file system snapshots utilizing butter fs on the

25:16.800 --> 25:22.240
root file system and then using zfs on the large external data pool not that we necessarily

25:22.240 --> 25:27.120
recommend you do any of this but we wanted to test it to see how it would hold up we wanted

25:27.120 --> 25:31.680
to find out so you didn't have to run a rolling arch server in production well and we both had

25:31.680 --> 25:36.400
such good experience with arch you know on the workstation on various machines in our life and

25:36.960 --> 25:41.280
we both knew that it had all the software and kind of got out of our way in terms of managing

25:41.280 --> 25:45.520
it was like a pleasant environment that we were both familiar with to admin so it was tempting

25:45.520 --> 25:49.200
to just see like yeah can we make it work here too and i should have looked it up before the

25:49.200 --> 25:52.640
show but i'm pretty sure we've crossed the year mark running this thing in production in fact we

25:52.640 --> 25:57.840
might even be rounding the second year possibly and it's it's all out there we've tried to put

25:57.840 --> 26:02.320
all of it out there as much as publicly possible so if this thing blows up on her face you know

26:02.320 --> 26:05.920
and you know because that's our our singular motivation is really just to prove if it's

26:05.920 --> 26:11.360
possible and if it's not we're gonna find out for you and the reality is this is a production

26:11.360 --> 26:15.120
server we really do use it so when it breaks it breaks in front of everyone and it hurts

26:16.720 --> 26:22.000
and you know it's out in a garage it's not particularly well thermally protected in fact

26:22.000 --> 26:28.240
it's not at all and there has even been some power outages recently and that's what's led us to some

26:28.240 --> 26:33.280
of the more recent issues initially we had some lockups that we traced back to net data but we

26:33.280 --> 26:36.880
weren't sure right before the road trip about a week before the road trip the server started

26:36.880 --> 26:42.880
locking up the worst timing impossible yeah we got it up and running again suspecting it was net

26:42.880 --> 26:49.280
data we turned off net data and the system remained running for you know a month maybe

26:49.280 --> 26:55.440
then about three weeks into my road trip the server went down i checked in i couldn't wire guard

26:55.440 --> 27:00.320
i couldn't talk to the server at all but i was able to use rust desk to get to a couple of the

27:00.320 --> 27:07.440
studio desktops and using that approach i determined oh power went out for a while and

27:07.440 --> 27:12.000
the funky way we have this thing wired up is one power supplies into the wall and one power supplies

27:12.000 --> 27:16.880
into ups for stupid technical debt reasons and i think when that happened the server got into

27:16.880 --> 27:24.560
a funky state and it eventually lost power then when it rebooted it came up in a bad way and never

27:24.560 --> 27:31.440
finished booting and i couldn't tell why because i was i was gone i was on a road trip and the old

27:31.440 --> 27:39.600
server admin in me was dying i had to know why my server was down plus i wanted my server back up

27:39.600 --> 27:43.200
right i mean here was this situation that we hadn't actually encountered right i mean we've

27:43.200 --> 27:47.840
we've seen it power cycled we've come back into the studio after the power went out and it's

27:47.840 --> 27:52.560
always been fun i mean it takes forever to do so but but it gets there yeah and of course it happens

27:52.560 --> 27:58.320
while wes is camping so i'm i'm gone wes is camping and then moving the whole thing was just

27:58.320 --> 28:04.400
like the worst time possible so we didn't know why it was back up and so like the last day of the

28:04.400 --> 28:11.280
road trip i legitimately just made a beeline for the studio i was just i got lady jupes to her spot

28:11.280 --> 28:17.680
i got lady jupes secured and parked and then i jumped in the car and i ran down to the studio

28:17.680 --> 28:23.280
to figure out what was wrong and i mean i literally i maybe was back in town from the road

28:23.280 --> 28:42.080
from the road trip for a grand total of an hour before i was in the car and headed directly to the studio

28:45.600 --> 28:47.840
uh-oh that's not a good sound

28:47.840 --> 28:57.200
well i've been in town for about an hour and i've already made it to the studio to try to figure out

28:57.920 --> 29:00.240
what's going on with the server

29:03.840 --> 29:04.560
getting a beep

29:04.560 --> 29:15.920
that seems bad

29:18.320 --> 29:19.200
i'm gonna shut her down

29:24.640 --> 29:26.480
seems that the console is locked right now

29:28.640 --> 29:33.680
take it down take it down we did have a power outage here seems like i didn't expect it to be

29:33.680 --> 29:35.680
on i thought it was going to be off

29:40.960 --> 29:44.880
i'm going to pull the power completely it's got a dual power supply

29:49.600 --> 29:50.560
go hug them back up

29:56.400 --> 29:57.920
both power supply fans are working

29:57.920 --> 30:01.920
oh immediately getting the beep

30:06.720 --> 30:12.400
hold on the beep just stopped the red light on the front of the chassis just cleared

30:17.520 --> 30:20.080
still waiting for console it hasn't posted yet

30:20.080 --> 30:30.080
there we go we've got post yes okay keep booting you bastard keep booting and it did and i i was

30:30.080 --> 30:36.400
sitting there thinking man i i expected some sort of catastrophic hardware issue and the entire time

30:36.400 --> 30:41.040
i kept thinking how could i have done this differently let's do a ping check

30:41.040 --> 30:49.280
let's do a ping check yes i am getting ping all right let's check if containers are up

30:55.840 --> 30:59.680
uh yes i think yes yes containers are up

31:03.200 --> 31:09.360
yeah they're definitely up there's a lot going on look at all that okay great

31:09.360 --> 31:16.000
okay i'm gonna go uh applications plunking see if everything's working and it was i mean for the

31:16.000 --> 31:21.200
next 24 hours or so the server ran great we were able to connect in over wire guard it was chewing

31:21.200 --> 31:25.440
away on a backlog of work just like it was supposed to it started sinking out results to

31:25.440 --> 31:30.640
lady jupes it was glorious everything and i was just like god i appreciate this i don't know why

31:30.640 --> 31:36.640
it crashed but i appreciate it so that was you know thursday or so friday things seemed fine

31:36.640 --> 31:41.440
saturday i kind of i got wrapped up in stuff we were doing with the kids and i didn't really keep

31:41.440 --> 31:48.240
an eye on things but wes and i arrived at the studio on sunday to record linux action news

31:48.880 --> 31:54.080
just as we sat down to get started we noticed something wasn't quite right and it didn't take

31:54.080 --> 31:59.360
us long to figure out the server had crashed again let's go check on it server's down we're

31:59.360 --> 32:05.280
going to go check on it we're recording land but we got to stop i got i got fish sticks air frying

32:05.280 --> 32:09.280
we got to see what's wrong with the server oh it's dark out here too

32:11.840 --> 32:18.720
none of the discs are flashing it's not beeping but this is like the state it was in the previously

32:18.720 --> 32:23.440
before my road trip where it would just kind of lock up and then you i could tell immediately

32:23.440 --> 32:27.760
because the fans are low and none of the hard drives are flat it's not working at all and when

32:27.760 --> 32:32.800
you got that many hard drives there's always at least one flashing let's turn the console on here

32:32.800 --> 32:34.800
what will we see i bet you it's just totally locked

32:36.960 --> 32:42.560
just locked it's hard it's just hard i wonder i wonder if net data started back up maybe it did

32:43.760 --> 32:49.920
and what is it probing so we gotta we gotta power it off and we'll start it back up and make sure

32:49.920 --> 32:55.360
net data isn't running hello over the face yeah there's nothing that feels better than physically

32:55.360 --> 32:59.840
powering off your server over and over again like that's not going to lead to problems i recommend

32:59.840 --> 33:05.920
you do it all the time i think it's off i think that's it this is as low as the fans ever go

33:07.920 --> 33:16.880
yeah here we go also i like how all of them light up red that's great really reassuring don't freak

33:16.880 --> 33:22.000
me out at all all right well i think we'll just watch this boot up it's gonna boot up fine i would

33:22.000 --> 33:31.600
imagine and uh we'll make sure net data isn't auto starting maybe i only stopped it and didn't

33:31.600 --> 33:37.360
disable it sounds like you i can't believe it was freaking net data again wes so i had not disabled

33:37.360 --> 33:43.760
it i had only stopped it previously before the road trip i mean you say net data i i surmise

33:43.760 --> 33:48.720
that you know anything poking those might do the same thing right really we have to figure out do

33:48.720 --> 33:52.320
net data as a monitoring agent we want to use something else to scrape the metrics do we want

33:52.320 --> 33:57.040
to just try to disable some of that you know poking the hardware monitor functionality for

33:57.040 --> 34:01.520
the time being i don't know we have bigger fish to fry first but we'll have to solve that down

34:01.520 --> 34:07.120
the road yeah i think you and i both kind of suspect there's some sort of hardware issue

34:07.120 --> 34:12.320
and net data is poking whatever that issue is and causing the lockup because when you get hard

34:12.320 --> 34:19.120
locks like this it almost always ends up being hardware and i remember now i hadn't disabled

34:19.120 --> 34:24.880
it because my intention was after the road trip to come back and fire net data back up and see if

34:24.880 --> 34:30.880
it locked up again and so accidentally we ended up testing that theory and it did seem to hold

34:30.880 --> 34:36.080
so as long as we leave net data disabled the system continues to run and assuming the power

34:36.080 --> 34:40.400
doesn't go out and i don't really know why it was in an air state other than i think one power

34:40.400 --> 34:44.000
supply is plugged into the wall one's plugged into the ups they've lost power at different times and

34:44.000 --> 34:48.720
it just sort of went into this failed hardware state and had that beep you could hear but you

34:48.720 --> 34:55.680
know what we have got some major stuff in the works very excited about this uh it's clear we

34:55.680 --> 35:01.120
need to replace the server we knew that before this latest round uh we bought it used it has

35:01.120 --> 35:06.880
served its term it started life as a free nasbox and then i think it lived life as a fedora box

35:06.880 --> 35:14.480
for a while it has seen some stuff yeah and we have figured out that we really need like a

35:15.280 --> 35:22.800
three-phase approach to replacing this thing so phase one is going to be replacing the server

35:22.800 --> 35:27.920
it's well actually i'm going to flip this west phase one is going to be breaking out wire guard

35:27.920 --> 35:32.640
onto its own dedicated box so that way in the future if our server crashes we can still get

35:32.640 --> 35:38.240
access to the network now we solve that with nebula and rust desk but we'd like to have the

35:38.240 --> 35:44.880
vpn capabilities removed from the server itself and on a different machine the debate there is

35:44.880 --> 35:49.360
and i'm curious where you fall down west we could do it on a raspberry pi like we could have a wire

35:49.360 --> 35:56.960
guard pie or we could replace that comcast router with like an open sense box and do open sense and

35:56.960 --> 36:02.240
wire guard on one box what do you think hmm yeah there are a lot of options i mean i think we have

36:02.240 --> 36:07.840
to decide yeah how many different things we want to administer and and how much i am kind of curious

36:07.840 --> 36:12.480
to see how well a pie would perform and that does have some nice options in terms of you know you

36:12.480 --> 36:16.880
have a whole bunch of pies laying around i do too so it'd be easy to drop in and test and we could

36:16.880 --> 36:22.640
do that real quick do you think a pie would be fast enough to be the firewall like i'm picturing

36:22.640 --> 36:28.320
a linux box with some basic firewall and routing we might just have to try right i don't i don't

36:28.320 --> 36:33.200
know i mean maybe put pie hole in a container for the dns and dhcp and then you know if it wasn't we

36:33.200 --> 36:38.400
could always migrate it to another rig later neil says the pie won't be fast enough for performance

36:38.400 --> 36:43.760
network stuff like almost always you need hardware acceleration for packet handling but we're just on

36:43.760 --> 36:48.640
a comcast connection it's like 300 megabits it's not just that it's about how fast you can push it

36:48.640 --> 36:55.440
not how wide you can go so yes sure like you can blow out the bandwidth of it any day of the week

36:55.440 --> 37:00.320
and that'll also be a problem but like the problem you're going to have more often is that you need

37:00.320 --> 37:05.840
it to be low latency and you need those packets to go out as fast as they can as close to line

37:05.840 --> 37:10.720
rate as possible especially when you're live yeah so raspberry pi would not work this is just why i

37:10.720 --> 37:14.800
kind of want to test it though yeah i i wonder and if the other thing i was thinking and maybe

37:14.800 --> 37:21.360
people could write in at linux unpluged dot com slash contact but like a really low power x86 box

37:21.360 --> 37:28.480
that has ipmi it's like a micro atx itx kind of like tiny box there are a few mini pcs that do

37:28.480 --> 37:33.280
actually have a bmc built in that you can use that might be something to look at as well but so i

37:33.280 --> 37:37.840
think phase one is going to be figuring out our vpn stuff and you can see there's some some stuff

37:37.840 --> 37:44.640
we got to sort out then phase two is replacing the server itself and the biggest challenge here has

37:44.640 --> 37:49.920
become the disc we need about 40 terabyte of new disc to come in that's clearly going to be the

37:49.920 --> 37:56.080
largest cost then the second challenge with a new server is what distro should we use obviously

37:56.080 --> 38:00.720
we've been using arch for a while it's been great and there's certainly a part of me that would like

38:00.720 --> 38:05.840
to just continue to use arch to see like how far can we take this thing before it breaks you know

38:05.840 --> 38:12.000
we already have some more updates on the server i just checked oh man but also i recognize this

38:12.000 --> 38:17.600
is an opportunity for us to try something else as well so in the show notes we'll have a link

38:17.600 --> 38:24.160
to a straw poll and i would like the audience to vote on which server distro we go with next

38:24.160 --> 38:29.360
there are only a few options because we've limited it to genuinely rolling distributions

38:30.080 --> 38:34.640
rawhide's on the list right now but neil brings up a good point that we could have significant

38:34.640 --> 38:40.720
issues with cfs if we went rawhide but not necessarily impossible to solve for so we have

38:40.720 --> 38:48.480
arch nix tumbleweed and rawhide all as an option for you to vote on right now the live audience

38:48.480 --> 38:56.160
has gotten 42 votes in so far these often will indicate the trend and right now tumbleweed is

38:56.160 --> 39:03.280
in the lead with 45.24 percent of the votes rawhide's in second place nix is in third and

39:03.280 --> 39:07.680
arch is in fourth if you have an opinion about this we're going to leave the poll going for the

39:07.680 --> 39:12.400
next week so go to the show notes we'll have a straw poll in there it's a crazy url so i just

39:12.400 --> 39:20.080
tell you what it is and go vote and uh we're very likely i mean like 99 likely unless some weird

39:20.080 --> 39:25.200
reason comes up gonna go with the distro that you guys choose rawhide gives me the most pause

39:25.200 --> 39:30.000
so not saying we're not gonna pick it but it's gonna require wes and i having a strong discussion

39:30.000 --> 39:34.480
if it does if it wins i like that this is the option you're the least sure of what a funny

39:34.480 --> 39:38.160
world but you're right i mean there will be some complications we might have to learn a fair bit

39:38.160 --> 39:45.120
about the internals of rawhide or tumbleweed if the if the trend line continues my friend which

39:45.120 --> 39:51.360
that's a whole new world what have we done using snapper so i guess like in that sense you know

39:51.360 --> 39:59.520
maybe it makes sense but true true there's also the hardware component of the server and i cannot

39:59.520 --> 40:06.560
believe this but the ups tracking numbers don't lie a listener has reached out mr real zombie geek

40:06.560 --> 40:14.160
is sending us some new server gear new to us he's actually decommissioning it but he has in route

40:14.160 --> 40:21.920
right now should be delivered tomorrow at the studio a dell poweredge r820 with and i i just

40:21.920 --> 40:32.000
can't even believe this four intel e5 4657 cpus each with 12 cores four of them with 12 cores

40:32.800 --> 40:40.640
and 384 gigabytes of ecc ram hey yo right i mean this i mean even if like it's maybe it's only two

40:40.640 --> 40:45.840
intel i can't imagine it's four maybe it's only two xeons that's gonna be an amazing amazing amount

40:45.840 --> 40:50.800
of compute for us uh he's shipping it with no caddies or drives so we're gonna have to figure

40:50.800 --> 40:55.040
out what kind of caddies that r820 takes and i'm gonna i'll go on ebay probably and buy like a

40:55.040 --> 40:58.880
whole batch of them so i've got some prep work to do here yeah and then jb's got to buy some

40:58.880 --> 41:04.880
discs right but i mean he's saving us a huge cost and i was considering going with another pre-owned

41:04.880 --> 41:10.080
server anyways and he's had this in production it's been a solid box he's just replacing it and

41:10.080 --> 41:15.440
he offered it to us and i just i can't believe it that's wonderful best audience in the universe

41:15.440 --> 41:19.360
there's just no doubt about it so that'll be the hardware whatever distro you all vote on will be

41:19.360 --> 41:23.680
what we put on there and then there'll be the third phase the third phase is going to be to

41:23.680 --> 41:28.960
set up some kind of remote console we were initially trending towards pi kvm and i think we

41:28.960 --> 41:34.720
still may try try that because i ordered a little pi kvm kit oh look at you but this power edge has

41:34.720 --> 41:40.320
a built-in idrac enterprise which may be just fine with we'll see yeah i'm kind of it'd be interesting

41:40.320 --> 41:44.800
to compare and contrast so with idrac there might be even some fun automation potential that you

41:44.800 --> 41:50.640
could you could work with because like i know that in in rail and centos and i think also in fedora

41:50.640 --> 41:55.920
and it would be in tumbleweed as well there's a lot of tools around integrating with various bmcs

41:55.920 --> 42:04.720
ilo from hpe generic ipmi redfish extended ipmi and idrac as well from dell so there's all kinds

42:04.720 --> 42:12.080
of fun opportunities there if you have like built-in management interfaces like that i love

42:12.080 --> 42:18.480
that yeah i can't believe it i mean what a what a gift to us right now because you know we just

42:18.480 --> 42:22.720
caught back from that road trip so expenses are tight right now so that's a great thing to have

42:22.720 --> 42:27.520
come along and uh should be great to play with and i don't know what i'll i may put the old server on

42:27.520 --> 42:31.520
a test bench and see if i can't narrow down what the issues are or it may just sit there for a bit

42:31.520 --> 42:37.280
we shall see but either way that's the that's the plan we have a three-phase plan to get this server

42:37.280 --> 42:42.400
going and uh wes and i are already beginning to play around with vpn options there's some really

42:42.400 --> 42:46.960
fun stuff out there we often talk about the desktop stuff because it's fun and we love the

42:46.960 --> 42:53.120
desktop but there's so much awesome stuff going on at these layers too so it'll be fun to deep

42:53.120 --> 42:58.320
dive into that and i'd love to get your opinion on which distro we should go with next so go find

42:58.320 --> 43:05.600
the straw poll link at linux unplug.com 425 oh it's time for feedback and hey maybe if you've

43:05.600 --> 43:10.240
got some ideas on what we should do in any of those phases well yeah right into the show but

43:10.240 --> 43:16.480
in the meantime aaron's already done that with a self-hosted location tracker he really likes

43:16.480 --> 43:20.640
now of course we had that set up at colony tracker.live a different piece of software

43:20.640 --> 43:26.960
that we've been testing out for the road trip but aaron has been using a nextcloud app called phone

43:26.960 --> 43:31.200
track this is an app for nextcloud i think i've seen this before yeah i think we just need to

43:31.200 --> 43:36.320
install it on the jupyter nextcloud instance that we've already got running as aaron suggests

43:36.320 --> 43:42.160
although i haven't actually tried it yet i like this as an overall approach to like taking something

43:42.160 --> 43:47.680
that i think a lot of us think is is taboo like user tracking and cameras right having cameras in

43:47.680 --> 43:53.920
your home oh i like taking that and putting it on its damn nose and saying well what if i do the

43:53.920 --> 43:59.360
tracking and i control the data well what if i run cameras but they only work on my lan and they go

43:59.360 --> 44:04.560
into something like shinobi and i record the cameras and can technology that we often consider

44:04.560 --> 44:11.760
invasive be used by me under my control and that aspect of phone track really appeals here because

44:11.760 --> 44:16.160
it's part of just hosting something yourself and if you've already gone to the trouble of setting

44:16.160 --> 44:21.200
up nextcloud you install this app and i think it has an android companion app too yeah you know

44:21.200 --> 44:25.840
aaron hits on that that he'd been on a journey to google fly and that location tracking was

44:25.840 --> 44:29.680
one piece of that and i think it kind of makes sense in some sense to have it integrated with

44:29.680 --> 44:34.800
nextcloud because yeah nextcloud can be a big part in getting off a lot of those popular google

44:34.800 --> 44:39.440
services and for his part he does notice that the phone app has worked pretty well and that

44:39.440 --> 44:45.200
he hasn't seen a hit to the battery life hmm yeah you can have it set so it sort of gets a the

44:45.200 --> 44:50.320
background location update from the android operating system we opted not to go with this

44:50.320 --> 44:56.800
just because we didn't really want to put our nextcloud instance public and own tracks was sort

44:56.800 --> 45:02.880
of perfect for our use case but by ben if i recall you gave this a go for a bit right yeah so i use

45:02.880 --> 45:11.360
it to track my phone and for when i lose it then i can find it again and it works really well it

45:11.360 --> 45:16.560
also says when it's collecting its gps points how many it's already sent how many there are in the

45:16.560 --> 45:23.840
session and it's also a really good platform for example if you've got drivers or delivery guys

45:24.400 --> 45:31.360
driving around you can see it really easily on a map and a nice overview and you see they have

45:31.360 --> 45:39.440
put some thought in multiple use cases but what i also noticed is you really need to get a good use

45:39.440 --> 45:45.120
of these sessions because i have for example one session of my phone tracking and once i pull that

45:45.120 --> 45:51.840
up my living area is just one big red dot about yeah you've been there there are all the lines

45:52.480 --> 46:00.960
and i don't know if it's my amount of data or my setup but the filtering isn't that really great

46:00.960 --> 46:09.520
for me at the moment but i assume they will be fixing that in later versions but yeah you can

46:09.520 --> 46:16.080
select specific sessions you want to record to and you can put devices in there but you have to look

46:16.080 --> 46:23.840
at if you need to select the session from your device itself so that is for me at least question

46:23.840 --> 46:30.400
mark if you can put devices in there from the server side okay that's good to know for people

46:30.400 --> 46:34.240
that might be interested in using it and we'll have a link to that in the show notes if you

46:34.240 --> 46:38.080
want to try it or actually no you know what no you just go in your next cloud you look in the

46:38.080 --> 46:42.400
apps and you just install it right there no link for you no link no link for you i will put a link

46:42.400 --> 46:48.080
to this though because i am on the search for i'd love something that's a server side web app

46:48.640 --> 46:53.840
that i hit up on my land and i paste a youtube url in and it downloads in the background and

46:53.840 --> 46:58.560
puts it somewhere on my file system and then i open up my media player of choice and it's

46:58.560 --> 47:02.000
connected to my nas and bam there's the youtube video and i've been looking for a web app to do

47:02.000 --> 47:06.800
this for a while and i don't know if i found the perfect one but i think i found a real contender

47:06.800 --> 47:14.240
it's called tube archivist it is a self-hosted youtube media server you give it the urls and

47:14.240 --> 47:19.920
then it will archive them and then present you a front end to review all of your downloads kind of

47:19.920 --> 47:25.680
give you like your own youtube um subscription feed but on your own box where it's pulled down

47:25.680 --> 47:30.880
the videos locally oh this looks nice yeah man and it keeps track of like which ones you've

47:30.880 --> 47:36.880
viewed and which ones you haven't viewed and uh it's using that new uh youtube dlp that we've

47:36.880 --> 47:41.760
talked about yt dlp instead of youtube dl oh we made that a pic a couple weeks back right yep yep

47:41.760 --> 47:47.200
so uh this is kind of like taking and putting it all together and then i like this because i thought

47:47.200 --> 47:51.520
i've got a couple of youtubers i've followed that have like put up videos and then pulled them

47:51.520 --> 47:57.760
but i also have a ton of videos i watch on youtube for like rv maintenance stuff and sometimes i'm in

47:57.760 --> 48:01.920
an area where i want to do some work and i'm offline this is what i was hoping for is something

48:01.920 --> 48:06.240
i could throw on my my box and just throw these links in there and then build a little offline

48:06.240 --> 48:11.120
youtube collection the only spot where i kind of got hung up and why i haven't pursued it and

48:11.120 --> 48:15.360
west you're gonna laugh at me but you know you gotta set up like elastic search and do some of

48:15.360 --> 48:20.720
that stuff and i just i didn't want to go that far but i wanted to give it a link so you're saying

48:20.720 --> 48:27.280
you need someone to write you a already composed docker compose file absolutely west that's exactly

48:27.280 --> 48:33.040
what i'm saying and and also if anybody has another tool to accomplish this same thing

48:33.040 --> 48:38.080
do let me know about it however you want to tell me because uh i'm always looking for uh for a way

48:38.080 --> 48:42.720
to do this yeah you know i want something like this but just if it also had some like chromecast

48:42.720 --> 48:47.600
support on the flip side you know it could kind of be the one-stop shop for all the videos uh

48:47.600 --> 48:54.320
that would be nice yeah yeah and for me personally i don't really need a front end that tracks the

48:54.320 --> 49:01.200
watch status because i just would like them on the file system and then i'll throw cody or jellyfin

49:01.200 --> 49:07.280
or plex or whatever at that directory and manage it with my existing media application so you just

49:07.280 --> 49:12.240
want the ingest side ingest and maybe a little bit of sorting you know maybe a folder per youtube

49:12.240 --> 49:17.600
channel and so you know if you download from this youtuber you put it in their folder automatically

49:17.600 --> 49:21.520
i don't know i guess i'm asking for the moon here but it seems like there must be something out

49:21.520 --> 49:26.480
there because i mean hell there's so many there were back in the day when we all watched our

49:26.480 --> 49:32.880
television via a cable there was like a dozen different pvr dvr solutions and there was myth tv

49:32.880 --> 49:37.520
and we just need something for the youtube age so if you know of one let me know and if you'd

49:37.520 --> 49:42.480
like to find our friends a cloud guru on social media they're just slash a cloud guru at pretty

49:42.480 --> 49:47.680
much any social media website the youtubes instagram slash a cloud guru go find them over

49:47.680 --> 49:51.520
there and see what they're up to if you do the twitter thing you can also follow the show at

49:51.520 --> 49:58.160
linux unplugged west you're probably over there i'm at west pane remarkable remarkable the show's

49:58.160 --> 50:03.120
over there uh the network's over there too yep that's true we have a show and a twitter for both

50:03.120 --> 50:09.040
of them and myself it's a lot of twitter accounts really who would have known i'd be managing so

50:09.040 --> 50:14.800
many different logins in 2021 and then don't even get me started on the show mailboxes holy smokes

50:14.800 --> 50:20.960

50:54.880 --> 51:00.560
joining us on this week's episode of the unplugged program it's not a monday it's not a wednesday

51:00.560 --> 51:09.120
no no my friends we will see you right back here next tuesday

51:30.560 --> 51:49.040
so along with their robot amazon has opened an invite only program for their previously announced

51:49.040 --> 51:54.880
home surveillance drone the always home cam that flies around and surveys your home for you

51:54.880 --> 52:01.920
oh man wes oh i think i'm about ready to go move out into the woods it's really just such a shame

52:01.920 --> 52:06.800
because it's like in some sense if i felt like i was actually in control of it yeah maybe i would

52:06.800 --> 52:10.960
want that you know it was open i could i knew where the data was going but of course that's

52:10.960 --> 52:14.720
not what we get that's very much like the philosophy i was just trying to articulate

52:14.720 --> 52:18.960
in the show it's like if if it's cameras that i have complete control over and i can replace the

52:18.960 --> 52:23.840
firmware and it's something i can check and monitor then yeah i'm okay with it but if it's

52:23.840 --> 52:29.200
something that i have no control over that could be easily perverted i find that gets dystopian

52:29.200 --> 52:34.000
really quick and it feels like there's a lot more of the ladder these days well with the dog you

52:34.000 --> 52:38.080
know i was just imagining here you are you needed to sit and then suddenly the connectivity goes out

52:38.080 --> 52:55.040
of just the worst time you
