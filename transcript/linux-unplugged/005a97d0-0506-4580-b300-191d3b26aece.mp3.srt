1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
Before we get started I got to give props to mr. Popey who pointed me out to this pretty sweet deal

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,560
Over by googs. You can get two gigabytes of additional Google Drive storage

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,800
If you just do a security audit check up on your Google account really seems like kind of a good idea anyways, right?

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,600
Well, yeah, I mean pay me to do something. I should be doing anyhow. Yeah

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,200
Yeah, you know you're not okay to call it the googs anymore, right? We got in trouble didn't we? Yeah, we did

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:30,420
I gotta hear the story. There's just people are complaining as usual people don't like

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,920
Yeah, people complain about system D. But we like that. So no, I guess googs is actually like a slam term in some areas

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,720
Like oh, oh, it's a cultural thing. Okay. Yeah. I'm I know that see I got googs. I didn't know Google

9
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,560
Yeah, I didn't know that either

10
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:49,920
Googs is actually kind of an endearing term. And meanwhile, no, they're saying googs. He's a guy who walks around wearing Google Glass. Yeah

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,440
Well, a good comparison is if you walk into a house in the 70s in the US and you say wow look at that shag

12
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,920
You're talking about carpet you do that in the UK. I'm pretty sure you're talking about two people doing the monkey

13
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,920
So, you know, I mean it's it's cultural. It's cultural. You could call it Google

14
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,660
It's like it's like if Google and I were like lovers

15
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,220
Like oh googs like that. We might know what my love nickname

16
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:20,260
Boy, there's there's really here's the thing Chris because I always have to start stories with here's the thing

17
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:27,460
The thing is I don't ever call anything by its actual name. I don't call Walmart Walmart. I call it Wally world

18
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:32,460
I don't call Google Google. I call it gooks. I mean I have abbreviated names for everything. It's an opportunity for fun

19
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:38,240
But I might they might be confusing it with that word. I do the same thing. I call mate a mate

20
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,580
And Tara gross and I don't know

21
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:46,360
To it's to two distinct syllables. It's supposed to be my tape. Yeah, right, right

22
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,940
Mate pay attention to feedback Chris. Yeah, I know

23
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:57,580
Once again, I can't help but point out that all of you will say something wrong at some point

24
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:01,020
And so long as you get the message across it doesn't really matter how you say

25
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:08,540
Oh, that was so beautiful. I know it actually made me feel better about myself

26
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:18,580
Welcome to the Linux Unplugged show or a weekly Linux talk show. That's definitely stuck in the Pacific Northwest rain

27
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,760
My name is Chris. Hey, my name is soggy

28
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,740
Right, I I was really nice my wife and kids stopped by a few minutes before the show started and

29
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,700
You know, that's that's a nice treat when they show up in the middle of the day

30
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,100
One of the benefits of working for yourself, I suppose but you know what wasn't so nice

31
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,460
What's that? You know, I go out there to be you know, just say goodbye and you know, sure

32
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,860
you know get everybody else situated buckle in the kids and

33
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:49,260
I wore my jacket and in that time I got rain and it's a pretty heavy jacket

34
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:55,180
I got rain through my jacket and the shirt underneath I'm wearing got totally soaked. So I'm standing here. Oh wearing wet clothes

35
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:02,340
Man, you know, they they that's funny. They have these things on sticks that apparently project the rain around you

36
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,340
I think they're called umbrellas

37
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,100
And living in Washington, I'm just you know, I should have stock

38
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:14,180
Well, it's it's manly in in this day and age to have an umbrella. It's no longer like a city we could do that now

39
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,860
Okay. Yeah, it's totally okay black umbrella. You're fine

40
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:21,780
Well Matt we have a great show today umbrella notwithstanding

41
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:29,500
Later on in today's show after we get through the feedback. We're gonna talk about Ubuntu phone. It's here. It's real starting next week

42
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,340
You'll be able to pre-order yourself a BQ phone run Ubuntu touch

43
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,780
We'll give you more details about that what the pricing is gonna be what the software situation looks like right now

44
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,700
We're gonna pick up Opie's ear on the launch event. They had an insiders event

45
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:45,300
I don't know what the heck that means, but I know people got their hands on special units. That also sounds very interesting

46
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:51,140
That in the show and then we're gonna really do a deep dive on this because normally we would

47
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:56,500
Cover a lot of this in the Linux action show on Sunday, but Linux action show this week was pre-recorded

48
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,860
So we didn't get a chance to fit this in so there's so much to talk about

49
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:05,420
So we're gonna we're gonna go in deep on that this week. But first gotta talk a little about own cloud 8.0 just came out and

50
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:12,380
I wanted to kind of noodle around with the mumble room see who's in the mumble room using the own cloud

51
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,700
So let's bring them in time appropriate greens mumble room. Hey guys

52
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:23,020
Oh, so we got a great note in the subreddit from seal 20 and

53
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,420
He's talking about kids from a rose

54
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:29,900
I was wondering how many people use own cloud in the last community and for what with the release of 8

55
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,340
I thought it'd be nice to ask the community. I'll start by describing my use case

56
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,300
He's got it on a cent OS 6 VPS own cloud 7 soon to be version 8

57
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:43,420
He uses that obviously the core own cloud components the contacts the gallery the documents the tasks news music chat

58
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:49,520
Calendar all that stuff. He's got six users on it. He's using mobile apps using cal dev and car dev and own cloud sync

59
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,540
Completely he's using as a complete replacement for Dropbox almost a replacement for Google

60
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,380
He shares photos with it shares files that are too big for email

61
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,260
Isn't currently using encryption has about 300 gigs in own cloud

62
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:07,240
Anybody in the mumble room currently experimenting with own cloud maybe done the upgrade own cloud 8 by chance

63
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,480
I have fun cloud now, which you know, is it so I use it. Yeah, I'm still using 7

64
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:16,040
No, what are you using on cloud for now? I yeah. Well, I started unbeknownst to me

65
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,200
You're not supposed to put all of your data into own cloud. It's not it's not quite there yet

66
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,440
Oh, so somebody forgot to tell me that and so I put every last bit of it

67
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,920
I tried it for a couple of weeks first on my laptop and everything worked out great

68
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:36,760
So I moved all of my data that I carry my laptop on a daily basis to own cloud and for the first couple of months

69
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,480
I thought I thought things were dandy every time I'd restore my laptop, which is you know

70
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,520
Once every three weeks or switch laptops

71
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,540
I would I just sign into own cloud and all my files would show up and then one day I went to look for a

72
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,520
File and it wasn't there

73
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:54,880
And so I started doing I started doing comparisons of the backup side made of my laptops and realized that over time

74
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:01,080
I had just been slowly losing files. No, and then what well, yeah, and then I brought it up to everyone thinking that everyone

75
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,820
Would have a solution and everyone's answer was yeah, you know that that that happens with a lot sometimes no

76
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,680
Well, so

77
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,220
I'm kind of out on cloud for the time being well, yeah

78
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:18,960
Yeah, I've noticed a lot of people online say I use own club, but I don't use the sync feature

79
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,860
And and then I think that's kind of how I use it. I do use own cloud sync

80
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,180
But I only use own cloud sync for a director that holds maybe 200 text files

81
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,500
That's about all I think and a few pictures things like that that I'm using for in production stuff

82
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,040
And then when it gets to heavy lifting for sinking

83
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,400
That's when I go bit torrent sync and I use a dedicated sync system to handle a lot of file sinking

84
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,680
I have to had issues with own cloud more in like I get all in and then I start hitting performance issues

85
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,040
Haven't had that as much with the later versions

86
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,300
So I've been bit a little bit by own cloud too. So I am a little trepidatious

87
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,060
What I use own cloud for today is card dav and cal dav sinking. I

88
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:03,260
Use it for minimal file stuff. Like for example, we have our assets for our shows

89
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,800
women's tech radio or how to Linux or Linux unplug that there's you know

90
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:13,240
You have PNG is of the logos and you have whatever the designers sent you the file and all this stuff that we need to share

91
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,240
Amongst people own clouds great for that

92
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,680
Outside of that I have ran into a few issues that have made me go kind of slow

93
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:26,580
And another one that we got in this kind of along the same thing is a 19 caster in the subreddit

94
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,120
And big bold letter says read the documentation

95
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,600
Before you upgrade to own cloud 8 because if you just do a pseudo app just upgrade it could break your own cloud install

96
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,360
So there you gave some links what you need to read

97
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,380
So if you if you are upgrading to own cloud 8 soon

98
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:45,020
I checked it out. Anyone else in the mumble room want to share their own cloud story

99
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,260
Yeah, I've really never had a problem with own cloud

100
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:53,880
I'm running on cloud 7 on open VSD and it's a manual install of own cloud

101
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,500
Not a not a distro install or anything like that

102
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,940
And honestly, I use it for syncing my files and I've never had a problem in this

103
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,620
Quite a few of us that use it that sync across

104
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:09,580
own cloud different files different folders all that sort of stuff and and I haven't noticed any any

105
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:15,300
File drops or anything like that and and performance wise it's been spot-on. So no problems here

106
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,680
No, do you remember what version of own cloud it was where you had data loss?

107
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,100
And I'm wondering if it was like if it was like seven seven

108
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,220
Oh, oh, I was gonna say like if it was like version six or five

109
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,300
I think that's when they initially introduced file sync

110
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,820
My question is to the gentleman that was just speaking

111
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,380
Did you have you do you have any files that are over like six or seven gigs?

112
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,380
And have you noticed any problems with those?

113
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:43,820
No, I don't true. I don't try to push that that size file in Australia. We our uplinks are absolutely pathetic

114
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,620
So we we sort of don't push big files, but I mean, you know

115
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:54,940
I've got a couple hundred Meg files and the checksums are still still spot-on on those. You know, they're ISOs. So

116
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:03,260
Yeah from from my point of view. I don't move gigs, but that could be a PHP limitation where you've got a configuration issue

117
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:11,580
Post yeah, that is that is something people that are running on cloud installs often run into is like settings in their PHP config

118
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,900
That prevent file size or timeout issues and things like that is a is a common issue

119
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,760
And the guys talk about that they do address that

120
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:25,500
Yeah, I'm running it on nginx with PHP FPM. So that's the only difference. I bet that's it

121
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,500
Well, I bet that's a pretty good setup though

122
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:33,860
Oh, yeah from a performance point of view. It's stable. It doesn't use system too much system resources

123
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,860
It's actually only running on a on a

124
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,660
VPS of you know a 512

125
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:46,080
Meg of RAM and you know, 20 20 or 20 or 30 something something only you use or do you have multiple users?

126
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,700
Now multiple users

127
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,420
Very nice. Well, I'm glad to get this

128
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,020
So we got it. We got a little mixed input mine

129
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,780
Mine has been somewhere in between what Noah's experienced, but I have had some issues

130
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:59,420
So just take it easy and start what I do is whenever it comes to data like this

131
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:03,380
I start slow, you know, and and I'm sure Matt would tell you to have a backup

132
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:09,780
Always backups for your backups. Yeah, and are you still are you still primarily using bit torrent sync matter?

133
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,260
Are you kind of now?

134
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:15,480
Are you been able to get off the box sauce because I'm having no getting fully off the Dropbox sauce still

135
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,620
I tend to use Dropbox for more of a I won't say backup because that would be entirely accurate

136
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,740
But for more long-term sending things back and forth as far as like over the web

137
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:29,100
But as far as like just on the land bit torrent sync is definitely what I do

138
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,620
It just makes sense because it's easy if something breaks, it's stupid easy to fix

139
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,540
You know, I just haven't had any problems with it

140
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,460
And I'm gonna give a obligatory plug for sync thing because we always get in trouble. We don't mention sync thing

141
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:47,140
Yeah, I I happen to like bit torrent sync a lot because I publicly share keys with folks and we sync over the internet

142
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:51,620
But if you if you don't have that requirement and you're like doing LAN thinking or syncing even not over land

143
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,000
But just a few machines sync thing is a very viable option

144
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,440
Yeah, I like bit torrent sync, especially when it comes to large files. Yeah, it doesn't give me grief

145
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,080
I don't have to worry about it. It just works and I can walk away and go have coffee. It doesn't matter. Yeah

146
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,560
Easy. Hey, you know one way you can make all of this work is with a digital ocean droplet

147
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,080
Whether it's own cloud or bit torrent sync or even sync thing

148
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,980
Digital ocean would be a great place to host that head over to digital ocean comm right now

149
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,900
In fact right after this one of our next emails is somebody's hosting something really really really cool on digital ocean

150
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,180
And again, it gave me a great idea of something I might try but I'll show that to you in a second

151
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:27,300
Uh digital ocean though. It's it's a it's a perfect opportunity for you to play with something like this or put it in a full

152
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:32,580
Production like we do here at Jupiter broadcasting. That's the great thing about digital ocean because of the value that they have you can go

153
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:39,660
You can easily easily justify going over there and and setting up a machine purely purely for educational reasons, right?

154
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:44,100
But because these are all SSD power because they have tier one bandwidth because it's Linux and KVM

155
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:50,300
You could also put in a full-scale production like we do and like my co-host on quota radio does for his clients

156
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,900
He puts their client back in app stuff on digital ocean and you can transfer those images around

157
00:11:54,900 --> 00:12:00,440
It's great because digital ocean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way for you to get started

158
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,540
Go over there in less than a minute

159
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:06,600
You'll have your own cloud server spun up and pricing plans start only five dollars per month for

160
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:12,060
512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one CPU and a terabyte of frickin transfer. That's amazing

161
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:16,500
And they have data center locations in New York San Francisco Singapore Amsterdam in London

162
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,900
So you can get that deal that geo diversity go out there and set up your own CDN or

163
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,860
Quite honestly one of the things I use that for and it's a small thing

164
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:31,380
but it to me it's like it's a nice thing I can do for the unfiltered audience without much cost because it's just five dollars is

165
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,380
I have a

166
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:38,540
Droplet in New York and I have a droplet in San Francisco and I have a droplet in Washington

167
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:44,180
All right, I'm sorry. I have a server in Washington and all three of them act as like a three-way CDN

168
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:49,020
so if you are in on the East Coast you can pull from my East Coast server much faster than you're gonna pull from my

169
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:54,620
West Coast server and if you're across the pond you can pull from all three locations at the same time and all of them come

170
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,300
From different routes. So it's it's a really cool way that I did like a cheap

171
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:04,420
Really kind of overnight bit torrent sync CDN and it's is a perfect probably not but man

172
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,260
Does it do the job for five dollars a month plus?

173
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:12,820
I've got other stuff running on that rig and I'm always setting up new droplets because it's so quick to get started that interface

174
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,140
It's like it's no it's no barrier at all

175
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:20,420
I can just sit down and get working because the control panel is so crazy intuitive and you can replicate the control panel on a

176
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,380
Larger scale with their API so that way if you end up getting a lot of droplets

177
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:29,200
You can scale the management of those droplets using that API taking advantage of tools already created by the community or ones you create

178
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,700
Yourself if you got the skills plus they've got great tutorials to help you get anything set up you need

179
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:37,180
This is really a great combination. They're taking Linux, right? They're taking SSDs

180
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:41,620
They're taking all this tier one bandwidth in these connections that they've managed to get in these great data centers

181
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,380
and they've brought all of it together with incredible customer service a

182
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:51,020
Expanding community that means great apps great tutorials incredible value backed by Linux

183
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:57,180

00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,940
Absolutely, you know something here

190
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:25,360
I did recently as I was working with a client and they were looking at setting up something with Moodle and that's like

191
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,760
Oh, well, you know I can set Moodle up and when I was googling around sure enough. They had a

192
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,260
digital ocean tutorial

193
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:36,440
Very very awesome and it was cool because I could go through with this client actually show them how it was being set up and what

194
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,360
All these things meant and all that sort of stuff. That's very awesome

195
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,980
Yeah, you know and that is a nice piece of mind for them, too

196
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,160
Is I'm gonna set this up on a digital ocean droplet right you and I ever part ways

197
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,020
You're not high and dry. They've got all of this information for you and you can yeah

198
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,780
That is slick and you know more and more when I'm searching for stuff

199
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:56,060
I'm seeing the digital ocean tutorial show up in the search results because they're just they're just great

200
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,900
So David my favorite. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. No, that's to say my favorite part was where they're like, oh, hey

201
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:05,700
That's great. But you have control over it because it's on your droplet and like ah, but I don't and I clicked a few buttons

202
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:11,460
It's yours. Yeah, it's your droplet. Yep. So David set up something kind of cool on one of his droplets

203
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,340
He says I'm a longtime fan of less and I want to tell you about a project

204
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:18,400
I have been working on it's a website called distro Plaza running at

205
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:24,340
Www.distroplaza.com you guys can go check it out while I talk about it if you want and it lets anyone upload a torrent of any

206
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,720
distribution for free

207
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,900
Every distro upload it gets a download page a forum a blog and a place for users to review the distro

208
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:36,180
Distributions also get user groups where they can use where you just can stay informed about what's going on with their favorite distro

209
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:40,740
Distro Plaza launched in January on digital ocean. Thanks to the awesome promo code JB provides

210
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,060
I would love to hear some feedback on distro Plaza

211
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:46,580
And if you think any other features that would be good for distro Plaza, I'd love to know you can check it out

212
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,460
distro plaza.com

213
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,900
And so we're looking at it right here. And so the idea is you have a you know

214
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,660
You have a distro you love a lot you upload the torrent

215
00:15:55,060 --> 00:16:00,260
So now they're seeding the torrent here or part of that they give you the forms. Here's the official Ubuntu forms

216
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:04,540
Here's their forms for it. Here's blogs. It would be specifically around Ubuntu. It's empty

217
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,660
I mean it needs content. And the other thing is I think it needs content from outside sources

218
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:11,900
I don't think you can depend on self-generated content. That would be my feedback to distro Plaza, but

219
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,180
It's kind of neat. It's a neat idea. It is a neat idea

220
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:16,540
Yeah

221
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,420
I could definitely see a direction where this could be really really powerful

222
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:24,940
Like a one-stop place to get information get the downloads the thing is this has been tried before so you got to really figure out

223
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:31,420
A way to do something different here. I think right right. I I would I would caution against so I would go one direction or the other

224
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:36,820
I would definitely caution against the community aspect of it unless you're vetting specific people that you trust or at least you know

225
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,580
No, I'm gonna just spam spam your stuff. You could try that approach

226
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:44,020
But I think really the idea of showing folks that you know, you're this type of person

227
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,420
You should be looking at these distros

228
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:50,060
You're that type of person you should be looking at that distros and look at the other attempts that have been made try and fine-tune

229
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,060
That dial it in a little better. I don't know

230
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:57,340
Maybe some previous things failed. Yeah, cuz there's some that have tried that aren't really that great

231
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:04,380
This actually is very clean. I like the layout. So good. It's very promising mumble room any thoughts any advice for our friend

232
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:09,180
David who wants to set up distro Plaza a place to feature distros and talk about them and download them

233
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,260
No going once, okay

234
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,580
Nobody had well, there you go David

235
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:19,300
You got Matt nice advice and the the mumble room will check it out after the show perhaps you can you can to listener distro Plaza

236
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,780
calm one last topic and then we're out of the feedback

237
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,460
I know I know but I want to give everybody a chance to chime in

238
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:30,420
I love the community interaction. In fact, it was one of the reasons why we started this show. It's wax of the reason. Yeah, so

239
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:37,900
Well, right then it sounded to me like Chris was pronouncing you block as you block, but I think it's pronounced mu block

240
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:43,340
He's not even shitting. You know the one that spelt you block. It's actually obviously it's a moo

241
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:47,860
Yeah, how because it's actually a Greek you so it's pronounced

242
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:52,260
Oh, yeah, like a micro since it's a lightweight regarding but anyways, he says back to adblock plus

243
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:57,580
I started using adblock plus shortly after it started even back when there's no option to allow Google text ads

244
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:01,780
He thinks that people care too much about it the acceptable ads program that we talked about last week

245
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:06,180
It's easy to change subscriptions in adblock plus so the one doesn't have a whitelist ads if you don't want them

246
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:10,220
But I think adblock plus is playing with fire a little bit. It reminds me a bit of the net neutrality issue

247
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,980
How block plus wants to provide?

248
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,020
To provide some privilege to some ads over others

249
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:23,140
Resources or money in other words and are necessary to review ads and decide what is acceptable and when it isn't they have chosen to

250
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:27,340
Let companies pay to be reviewed faster, which effectively means companies can get in ahead of other people

251
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:33,100
They will stay they will say that the prioritization does not impact their criteria for what is acceptable ad

252
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:38,020
But their money incentives for the program really don't line up with what is best for the user and this is something I didn't realize

253
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:42,020
I didn't realize that I knew you could pay adblock plus not to be on their block list

254
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:46,580
I didn't know that you could pay adblock plus to grease the wheels a little bit sort of like when you're getting a passport

255
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,580
You want to you want to rush it?

256
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:54,340
Yeah, see here's the and I I did and here's why I don't care because I mean I care in a sense

257
00:18:54,340 --> 00:19:00,380
But I think it's important to really really take this way until it's being bundled into browsers or forced onto people

258
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,340
It'll take care of itself. I think it'll snuff itself out

259
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,620
I think he's gonna pay a heavy price for it because I think it's a bad idea

260
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:09,300
But if it was pre-installed, yeah, that would be very scary

261
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:13,020
That would be very that'd be frightening because then it then it isn't that neutrality issue at that point

262
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,060
Yeah, and it is you're right is the user's opt-in. So yeah, that's a good point

263
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:23,080
Yeah, but it definitely I agree that it's a it's a very shady sleazy not very long-term healthy kind of approach. So

264
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,580
Yeah, I still remain I still I think one of the reasons one to read this emails

265
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,940
I'm still pretty undecided on the whole ad blocking thing

266
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:35,260
I mean obviously where this show is an ad supported show and so I wouldn't want people to block ads on this show

267
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,600
I'm sure a lot of people skip them

268
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,420
I would hope they don't and we try to change them up a little bit

269
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,940
So that way you won't and it would cut it would hurt us

270
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:46,260
Like so if if there was such a thing as ad block for podcasts and 90% of the people listened

271
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,980
We would go out of business

272
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,980
Well, so here when it comes to advertising and this includes Adsense or audio ads

273
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,460
The thing you have to remember is is that advertisement?

274
00:19:54,460 --> 00:20:00,140
Does it have any slim potential of offering a true benefit to the user our ads do we like them?

275
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,260
We feel that they're awesome things that we're excited about we want to share them

276
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:11,020
even Adsense to a limited degree, especially when it first came out did potentially offer some advantage to a user they go to a

277
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,940
Maybe a decor website

278
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,260
They're gonna have decor ads that might help them enhance enhance what they're wanting to do

279
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:21,180
Now that being said when you have flashing banners and pop unders, that's not a value-added situation

280
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:26,620
That needs to die in a fire. So, you know, so my philosophy on that is you know

281
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:31,040
People are gonna use these apps. They want to do that. That's fine. So in tech circles

282
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,300
Yes, ad blocking is gonna happen outside of tech circles. It's a mood issue

283
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:41,300
I think we're in a good position because our stuff is audio based and video based where it's really not as not as big

284
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,580
Of an issue in that regard except for obviously Adsense and things like that

285
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,900
But yeah, and I think you made a good point like it's the wash

286
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:51,020
It's on it and this is and then we'll get off this because it's not strictly related

287
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:55,100
But I guess this is why I have kind of kept opting back to turning off ad blockers is

288
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:59,700
Because if the publisher wants to publish a full-screen takeover ad

289
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,820
Then I want to be able to judge them for that

290
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,540
And so like one of them like you said one of the things is we make sure like the ads we pick

291
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:11,780
There's not a single sponsor. We have that, you know, we don't actually use like right exactly. That's a big deal

292
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:15,820
We actually like these so it's not like we're just you know, picking random people out of a hat, you know

293
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:19,640
And so yeah, that's that's where I think they so they cross the line

294
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,700
They sort of like they sort of take the audience for granted in that regard and they shove too much in their face

295
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,780
And it's never it's it's it can't work when you when you do that much as its noise

296
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,500
And that's why people I think resort to using ad block

297
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,780
I think it's and most importantly does it inhibit the user experience?

298
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:42,660
That's when an ad block is acceptable at any case in any scenario if it's in literally legitimately inhibiting an experience now a quick

299
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,940
Commercial before YouTube video is not inhibiting your experience

300
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,140
20 a few seconds in it gives you the option to skip it get over yourself

301
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,040
Yeah, yeah

302
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:54,700
but if it's a big but if you're on a mobile phone and you've got that big ad that just covers up the entire screen and

303
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:59,420
It's playing video and you can't find the X that's inhibiting my experience. They need to that needs to stop. Yeah

304
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,340
And now I would like to take a moment to tell you about vitamins and

305
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,260
And power shakes, yeah

306
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:16,700
I we the numbers been pretty quiet on the ad issue anybody have any final thoughts before we close the book on this topic

307
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,700
Mamba room. This is your chance

308
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,060
well, you know, it's

309
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,100
the adverts on TV and

310
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:32,700
Podcasts and you know radio or whatever. They're they're all a lot a lot more difficult to

311
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,100
Get away from than adverts on the web

312
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,140
I mean brevets on TV

313
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:44,020
I used to have a PVR that actually had an advert skip button and all it was was a

314
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:50,160
One-minute forward skip and I knew that I could go bam bam bam bam and forward skip through the TV others and I had no

315
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,080
moral compunction during that whatsoever right yet the

316
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,200
Yeah, and there's a big TV company and I'm paying for the delivery of that that service to my house

317
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,480
Anyway, whereas an independent

318
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,600
Content creator on the web. It's it's a different story. There's like

319
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:14,360
Sometimes one guy who's creating that website and maintaining it keeping it running running the server and creating the content as their full-time job

320
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,200
And so I generally don't run adblock at all

321
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,800
Unless the site looks like a bag of crap like for Onyx in which case I will

322
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:32,120
So far that's totally that's totally larval like you're explaining these one guy runs the whole thing he matches all of that but yeah

323
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,480
Right. It's a tough line to walk and it's particularly hard. I mean not to not to take this in a weird direction

324
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:45,800
But it is particularly hard to monetize probably more hard than normal in the free and open source software community because oh, yeah

325
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:50,680
yeah, you know what I mean, so like I mean not necessarily I mean obviously people are willing to pay with in the I mean

326
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:55,400
Look at the humble bundle and our patreon people are willing to pay when they feel there's value there

327
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:00,760
But I think some people are a little afraid of that and I can understand people also pay when they're guilt-tripped into it

328
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:06,760
I mean look last week what happened to the the GNU PG developer guy story comes out and suddenly his

329
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,360
Donation goes from like 20,000 euros up to 120,000 years in a day

330
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:18,920
And you know when people feel guilty about it, then yeah, they they will throw a few coins in in sure

331
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,480
So, you know help maintain it but often they won't do anything

332
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:28,840
You know people will pay the minimum for humble bundle no matter what anyone says about the fact that Linux users pay more

333
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,640
Many people pay the absolute. Yeah

334
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:38,020
They they need to so, you know, and everyone's in the same boat. Nobody has like buckets of money for us, right? Yeah

335
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:43,260
It's a lot of things also try to get under Google's example when it comes to things

336
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:48,940
So they don't really know of many other alternative ways to fund their project. They just do that the Google way had

337
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,740
otherwise

338
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:57,020
Yeah, but I think having or asking or saying that you need something and if it's a really good project like, you know

339
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,020
GNU PG or

340
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:05,100
AdLock if you ask their users and you have a good product that's worth paying for well, I pay for it. Mm-hmm

341
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:12,740
Yeah, that's exactly how I feel, too. Yeah, I'll make two points is I think that it really behooves the content creators to do their

342
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,580
due diligence and

343
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:20,460
Looking into who's advertising and how they're advertising such as you guys do and the other thing is, you know

344
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:26,900
sometimes you'll get caught up in people using ad block because of all the sites that don't do that due diligence and

345
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,300
We have to be reminded to go turn it off for your pages

346
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:34,740
Mm-hmm. Well and read it has a nice approach if you use ad block and read it

347
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,260
It says hey, you know, you're using ad block and that's cool

348
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,940
But if you don't use it, they actually have a little banner that appears to says hey

349
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:43,420
Thank you for not using ad block on our site. Yeah, that's that's the way to do it

350
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:47,940
I find reddit ads are pretty pretty tame. Yeah, I don't really mind them at all

351
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,460
And and I do like being thanked for turning off ad block

352
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:59,620
I know that's a stupid thing, but I do kind of like it. It helps. It's psychological. You can't argue. Like you know what? You're welcome

353
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:03,140
Because that exact little thing is what's reminded me in some instances

354
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:08,060
Oh, I have ad block on or you block and you go turn it off. Yeah, and I just whitelist them now

355
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:11,900
I mean, it's like I'm okay with that. Yeah. Yeah, good point. All right

356
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,940
Well, you know what a chat room wants to talk about it

357
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,780
Maybe in just a second before we get into the world just real briefly then we're gonna be a bunch of fun stuff

358
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:24,700
Chairman really wants to talk about this Raspberry Pi 2 problem. Oh, yeah. So yeah, okay. We'll do that

359
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,700
We'll do that. I think we'll have a quick one on that

360
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:31,420
Why don't we you know what? We'll mention one of our great sponsors one of the ones that we use one that I've used for

361
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:35,140
Over two years now. I've been a ting customer for over two years. I think math clocking up on that, too

362
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:40,020
It's got a really close. If not, I mean, it's got it. I mean really it's yeah, it's got to be close two years

363
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,660
and so I

364
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:47,580
Can say now confidently that I am truly a ting user and I do recommend them start by going to linux.ting.com

365
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,340
That's gonna give you $25 off your first device now

366
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:55,220
I'll tell you why that's a big deal here in a second if you have a ting compatible device and because they're adding

367
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,220
GSM there's more and more all the time

368
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:01,700
You're gonna get a $25 credit that credit might just pay for your first month. Here's why?

369
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,620
No contract

370
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:12,500
No early termination fee. You only pay for what you use what you only pay for what you use. I know I know it's crazy

371
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:17,860
You're here's what you're saying. You're saying Chris crazy things too crazy. They can't afford to do that. You know what you're wrong

372
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,060
You're wrong Kyra's here to tell you why?

373
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,740
Ting keeps rates simple. We don't make you pick a plan instead

374
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:28,540
You just use your phone as you normally would how much you use determines how much you pay each month

375
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,180
You can have as many devices as you want on one account

376
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,380
That's good

377
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:36,540
Because when you use more you pay less per minute message or megabyte of data

378
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:41,700
Your usage plus six dollars per active device on your account plus taxes is your monthly bill

379
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,700
Simple that's what we mean when we say

380
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:53,180
Mobile that makes sense. Yeah, go over to linux.ting.com just get that savings by the way remember how I said that $25 matters

381
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,900
From time to time ting get some great deals in on my fi hotspots

382
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,540
And they just got back in the Novotel my fi 5580 once you go to linux.ting.com

383
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:05,940
That's a $96 tri-band LTE hotspot

384
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:09,920
$96 you own that thing. It's not it's not locked either you own it

385
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,160
It's yours, and it's six dollars for the line

386
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:17,860
You can even turn that off when you don't need it, and then you just pay for the data usage

387
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,260
Why wouldn't you just have that in your pocket now?

388
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:24,060
They don't have this device all the time, so I mentioned it right now again. It's the Novotel my fi 5580

389
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:31,940
$96 tri-band LTE hotspot with a LCD screen on the front that gives you your signal stats your connected devices your battery information

390
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:37,140
What type of cellular network you're on and this is great even if you just use it when you travel?

391
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:41,260
This is an unbelievable value, and they got every kind of device you'd want start by going to linux.ting.com

392
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,580
And if you have any questions you can call them at one eight five five ting

393
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,140
FTW also on their blog right now if

394
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,100
And I know from some of the emails

395
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:54,500
I've gotten net neutrality and title two are on your mind ting has been very upfront about their position and

396
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:59,380
What they think is important in this debate and discussion, and they have another blog post up on there

397
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,500
It's on its ting.com slash blog

398
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,740
But start by going to linux.ting.com to read that

399
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:08,620
And they also up on the blog have a tip for how you can download Google Maps for offline use if

400
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,340
You're gonna go somewhere. We don't have signal or you want to save some data

401
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:15,740
Turns out there's actually a really great way to save the maps in Google Maps offline

402
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:19,280
So you can get them without even a connection they have that up on their blog as well linux.ting.com

403
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:24,040
And a big thank you to ting for sponsoring linux unplugged and thank you all of you for out there and trying them

404
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,300
I can say I really do recommend them and by the end of February

405
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,740
Things are really gonna get crazy for ting when they're rolling it when they're rocking

406
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:37,660
GSM and CDMA at the same time that is it's gonna be huge huge. Who else is doing that nobody exactly nobody else is doing that

407
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,820
Linux nothing calm

408
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,060
Okay, so real quick

409
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:45,220
I guess it turns out this new Raspberry Pi 2 that we were talking about last week

410
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:50,360
If if you expose it to a bright flash like a xeon flash like on a camera flash

411
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,660
Not just like room like you don't just turn on the light

412
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:58,260
But like you really explores it to a bright light it like kills power to the device and causes it to reboot

413
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:02,140
So you can reboot a Raspberry Pi 2 by flashing a light at it

414
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:07,700
So what you're telling me is no Raspberry Pi's can be used in

415
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:11,340
porn studios photography situations, I mean like so

416
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:19,020
I mean, you know, well, I got one in my basement, you know, so you just totally killed my dream here, right?

417
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:23,300
I mean, it's like oh my god that just that totally just see I can't that just totally changes everything

418
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,700
I gotta go and get nuts or something

419
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:29,380
I know I think people just find this to be funny because it's probably not and I guess there's even like an epoxy paint people

420
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:34,020
Already using to cover up the chip and and make it so it's not but it's just it's hilarious. Oh

421
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:39,780
In a go-go way you have something to comment about lasers on the Raspberry Pi. This sounds um

422
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:45,860
But someone I was reading a reddit. Someone also said the laser also affects the Raspberry Pi and does the same effect

423
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,780
lasers freaking lasers

424
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,260
On their head

425
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:57,340
Yeah, I didn't I don't know what to make of this but I know people that adore them I thought that was funny

426
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,340
So yeah

427
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:02,740
Is it me or does it strike me as Jerry Springer in a way like you could actually have a Raspberry Pi sitting on a on

428
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:06,940
A chair and you know the other person with lasers and flashlights attached to them having this conversation

429
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,580
I don't know the whole thing just seems silly

430
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:13,620
I was picturing like like elite government agents who take over like a

431
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:20,020
Middle-eastern compound that using Raspberry Pis by going in flashing lights at the Raspberry Pi is causing the security grid to crash and then they

432
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:23,220
Infiltrate and drop troops in and and it's a big American

433
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:27,360
It's the next big American movie and it all happened because they flashed lights at Raspberry Pis

434
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,380
No, that's pretty in-depth

435
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:34,860
That's where I was going with that. All right. Oh any other thoughts?

436
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:39,920
They'll just put that in the black hatchet or something. Yeah, sure. Yeah, exactly

437
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:45,500
Advertising as a feature you could yeah, you know, you could set up lighting in your in your server room

438
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:50,140
We have a bunch of Raspberry Pis and you could flash the lights when you need all your servers to reboot. There you go. Yeah

439
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:56,860
All right. Yeah, let's let's let's talk about what we're all really here gathered today to talk about and that's this new BQ phone

440
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:02,740
That goes on sale next week. It's like around 170. I think what is it? Like probably like a hundred?

441
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:05,520
I don't know about 175 dollars. I don't know what it's going for exactly us

442
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,580
and

443
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:10,060
There's even a little video now. I don't think there's a lot of words in this video

444
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,180
So I'll just I'll just put up on the stream so we can look at it

445
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:16,460
I mean, it's it's definitely a very fancy video after all of the waiting

446
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:20,580
I mean it I know it's only been a couple of years, but it feels I mean, that's a long time

447
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:25,300
In the scheme of developing something like this. That's not actually a long time

448
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,500
But more people sitting on the outside. It feels like a long time

449
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:34,840
And so this is this video is extremely well done. I hope I don't know if you know any of the background on this video like

450
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:41,300
This is the first time I saw it was last Friday. It was it was shown off at

451
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:46,420
An event in London and I'd never seen before and actually that's at the bits where you see outside

452
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,980
They go on top of a building is actually on top of our office building

453
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:54,780
Yeah, I can recognize certain, you know parts. Oh, that's funny in the video

454
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,420
Yeah, I think and we'll have the video linked in the show notes

455
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:03,580
I think one of the things the video does really well for me is it it's essentially without being too obvious about it showing me

456
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:10,420
You know kind of how Ubuntu touch would sort of fit in with like the ideal daily lifestyle that of course nobody truly lives

457
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:17,180
But if you live that like it I get like contextual information becomes available to me just by watching that commercial like it's surprisingly effective

458
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:22,380
Life at your fingertips is the slogan. That's pretty good. This is really well done. I

459
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:27,100
Think so, I think they did a nice job with it. I think it's gonna be interesting to see where it goes to

460
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:33,340
So the Aquarius e4 5 4.5. It's 4.5 inch screen, huh?

461
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:39,140
Well, so there you go, so the bq phone it's not like it's not a screamer of a phone

462
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,140
It's not gonna blow you away with its stats

463
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:45,780
It's got a 4.5 inch screen runs at 540 by 960 resolution

464
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:53,860
1.3 gigahertz quad-core ARM Cortex a7 media tech CPU a molly 400 GPU at 500 megahertz again

465
00:33:53,860 --> 00:34:01,320
Media tech 8 gigabyte EMC storage 1 gigabyte of RAM 2150 mil amp battery dual micro sim and 8 megapixel rear shooter

466
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:07,840
As far as first goes it's not bad, especially if you consider that, you know for a certain sector of the market

467
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,840
That's plenty phone. Oh, yeah

468
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:17,180
I think anyone coming into the smartphone space for the first time is gonna be pleasantly surprised and I think that's really where they're gonna hit

469
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,540
Their sweet spot now, that's where I would target. I think that seems like that's what they're doing now

470
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,740
It's not launching in the US yet. Yeah

471
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:27,980
But it is available it'll be available I wonder I wonder if I'll still be able to buy it

472
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,700
The the

473
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:38,940
The event that will happen last Friday there were 30 people invited from this is around the world

474
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:44,900
Yeah, it's called the yeah, the insiders event the Ubuntu inside is they were actually invited a couple of months ago

475
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:49,380
We built a list of people that we thought might be interesting to come along and and see it

476
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:53,540
and there was a couple of journalists a couple of video bloggers and

477
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,700
some

478
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,380
some like blogger bloggers like written bloggers and

479
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:05,980
Members of our community developers and what you might call outsiders from the community

480
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:12,460
Just come along and we give them a phone and they get to be the the first

481
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,660
People with one of these devices

482
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:20,000
We also gave them a few little tidbits of information over the over the month leading up to it

483
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:25,060
and then we flew them out to London on on Friday and they they came and saw the

484
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,540
that video and a couple of talks by

485
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,380
I was a guy from BQ there. There was a

486
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,580
Couple of people from canonical giving talks

487
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,380
It was really good fun

488
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,380
Phone right?

489
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:44,220
Yeah, we gave them all phone and it was in a special presentation origami presentation box

490
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,900
there was a phone and a

491
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:54,500
Pair of nice headphones. Yeah, it even it even warranted the Ubuntu phones first official unboxing video

492
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:59,460
Which omg Ubuntu picked up and ran that Ubuntu phone box is slick. I gotta say that's a nice looking box

493
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,940
it was funny the

494
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,860
We were asking them. Look do you mind if we video you?

495
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:08,980
Opening because we know what it's like, you know, people want to see the thing on the box

496
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:12,540
Yeah, and so the video that you're showing now of that's Jordan Keys

497
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:17,220
Unboxing yes his he actually ran back to his hotel room

498
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:23,100
Or ran back to another room in order to to do that and then we went out for beer in the evening while his video

499
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:27,140
Was rendering out and then he uploaded it to YouTube when he got back after a few beers

500
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,020
It was it was good. It was a good day

501
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,900
I noticed too that I noticed that they come with a

502
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:38,420
The the insiders edition came with a very nice set of just headphones like an extra perk there. That's really cool

503
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:45,700
yeah, yeah, we wanted to give them a little bit of something extra say thank you for taking part and and you know

504
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,660
Coming all the way to the UK

505
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,020
I mean some of them flew over

506
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:53,740
Some of them didn't have far to come but it was nice of them to come over and just take part and and give us

507
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,740
Feedback as well, you know, we've been capturing feedback from them

508
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:01,900
You know, I was walking around on the Friday with a notebook old-style paper notebook right now

509
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,500
We're saying hey what about this and how does that work?

510
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,380
And why is this like this and I was making lists and you know

511
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:12,620
I've been giving feedback to developers and filing bugs like, you know

512
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:17,820
Doing all the due diligence because these are the first people that have seen them outside canonical. We've all seen it evolve

513
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:22,540
You know, I've had one of those phones since August last year and I use it every day

514
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:25,780
But there are things you just don't notice and then when someone

515
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:31,220
Why why is it doing allowing me to do this? Anything? Oh, wow. Yeah, you're right. Yeah

516
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:36,040
It's just something because you use it every day. You just don't think that's yet. Very much do that

517
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:42,380
Yeah, very much. So that is very true. So so actually they they go on sale as a flash sale starting tomorrow

518
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,980
Which is Wednesday the 11th of February at 8

519
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,980
8 o'clock

520
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:54,180
UTC so it's 9 central European flash sale means only gonna be available for a limited time or suckers like me

521
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:57,060
Are we gonna be able to buy it or is it only gonna be a region?

522
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:04,140
It's all day. So it's 9 9 the central European time till 6 central. So 8 till 5 UTC

523
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:09,500
So yeah, it's a fairly lengthy amount of time throughout the day. It's not like, you know, a 10-minute flash

524
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:14,900
So it's not like the whole world has to be dos. So I might actually website for the day

525
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,900
I know you could try

526
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:21,100
Yeah, I'm certainly going to bed early so I could get up

527
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:26,980
It's like Christmas for me tomorrow because I'm gonna be ordering one. Obviously. Yeah, you know, we're all gonna be ordering them

528
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,920
Are you pretty excited?

529
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,780
Yeah, it's it's you know, the fact that you know

530
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:36,460
I started working at canonical three years ago knowing that this was gonna happen and

531
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:40,140
It's taken a long time for us to get here and we've you know

532
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:47,820
we've had a lot of flack along the way and the method by which we've developed this and the software choices that we've made and

533
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,420
the

534
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:54,800
Hardware specification of the first device, you know, this is remember. This is the first Ubuntu phone, right?

535
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:59,020
Hopefully one of many devices, you know if we come back on

536
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,940
unplugged episode

537
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:05,820
600 they'll be you know a plethora of these phones out there who knows

538
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:11,060
You know, are you already looking at the next device a little bit because I know they we've already said the next one is there

539
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:16,340
Yeah, yeah, that one's gonna be a little more like a larger screen, right one thing and yeah

540
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:21,040
It's yeah, it's quite a bigger screen and more it's more cores more round, you know

541
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,340
Yeah more and bigger of everything. But yeah

542
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,620
How important was it, you know

543
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:33,220
You mentioned that you've had one iteration of this another since August is that part of why you know

544
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:37,740
you got to start and you kind of have to lock in the specs at some place and then start developing for that and so

545
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:42,300
This bq phone. Yeah, it's sort of been locked in for a while. I take it

546
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:48,860
Right, and so we initially were you know, we've had loads of different hardware over the the time that we've developed this

547
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:53,140
We started off with a tablet edition on an Asus transformer TF 101

548
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:53,420
Yeah

549
00:39:53,420 --> 00:40:00,180
And we've moved through very and Nokia n9 and various Samsung galaxies and Nexus devices and you know

550
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:05,300
Then we got a partner in bq so we grabbed a bunch of those devices and we started doing the hardware

551
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:11,460
Enablement and making sure all the apps work because you know if we've been focusing on the Nexus 4 then we discover that

552
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:16,020
Oh, actually certain dialogues don't feel on the screen. I was this thing slightly different

553
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:22,360
so so we have to make sure all our apps and the dash is responsive and you know scales down to

554
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:26,820
Devices of this size and it's actually made us more disciplined having a device that has

555
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:33,620
more constrained hardware resources is probably better for us if we had the MX for first and

556
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,980
Had your octo core with 2 gig of RAM, right?

557
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:43,380
We could have gone nuts and you know made some decisions that actually we'd regret later because we'd have to try and scale it back

558
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,700
whereas

559
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,700
from what I'm told

560
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:51,100
Even unoptimized on the MX for it flies along. I haven't actually got one myself

561
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,620
But I'm told it flies along

562
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:58,540
And it's you know, it's pretty good on this bq device and we've still got some more optimization to do

563
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:05,620
So yeah, there's still work and we're still ongoing and and the good thing is that we continue to deliver updates to that device

564
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,700
so even when we've moved on to the to the

565
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:13,740
MX for and the next device and the next device all the previous devices continue to get those updates

566
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:16,560
The MX for looks so sweet

567
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:22,260
Wow, this looks like a yeah. Yeah, I mean I want the bq just to have the experience

568
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:25,620
But I think the one I'm gonna land on would be the MX for this is an incredible phone

569
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:31,460
I want them all. Yeah. Well sure, of course. That's like trading cards. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah, exactly. Yeah

570
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,900
so

571
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:37,960
How much how much energy do you do you suspect canonical will put into?

572
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:41,760
Sort of like I don't want to know if a generic image is the right one

573
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:47,880
But an image that's essentially with some modifications that'll work on most smartphones. Is that something canonical ever come?

574
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:52,940
You can't really do that because the arm architecture so let you so there's a couple of things

575
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:58,940
Yeah, arm doesn't really have the concept that the PC world has in terms of a CPI and device discovery

576
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:02,280
You know, that's that that's very mature on the PC and you can have one code base

577
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:08,580
Stickers USB stick in it and it will boot auto discover everything and figure out what drivers to load at runtime

578
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:11,380
And the second problem is most

579
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:15,660
SOC is most of the chips that are in phones have

580
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:18,100
binary blobs and you know

581
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:22,740
That's that's sad and disappointing and but that's just the world we we live in right now

582
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:26,900
There are no free soft fully free software phones. None. No whatsoever

583
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:32,380
So whenever anyone complains to us that we're not a fully free software phone. Well, good luck finding one

584
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,740
Well, yeah, if you want to if you want to phone just phone calls

585
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:39,780
Right. Yeah, or is usable in any way shape or form. Yeah, so

586
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:46,060
We you know, we we have to build an image that is used, you know usable on a specific device

587
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:51,220
but that's that's actually where we've been quite cunning with this is that we have multiple layers to the

588
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:54,420
To the image that goes on the on the phone

589
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:58,620
There's the very base layer which is the device specific part and that's you know

590
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:02,580
There'll be a device specific bit for BQ a device specific bit for the MX for and then

591
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:08,620
What is that is that is that a specific kernel what what is that layer composed of?

592
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:17,020
Yeah, so that's the that's effectively the kernel and the drivers for things like the GPU the radios and all that the sensors

593
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:21,540
You know, so so for example if a device comes along that has a fingerprint sensor just for the sake of argument

594
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:25,100
You know, we might want to support that and there'll be a device specific thing driver

595
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:30,660
Yeah, we need to go in but on top of that is the second layer, which is the user space bit

596
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,220
which has got all of our

597
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:35,420
Ubuntu stuff in and the dash and then on top of that is your apps

598
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:41,100
But also the the OEM or the carrier can put their own

599
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:46,280
additional bit on top so so we control a bit in the middle that's that's the

600
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:49,340
the app the the

601
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:54,980
Api's and all the stuff people right? Yeah and the dash and the common bit that you would see across all the devices

602
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:58,180
The bit at the bottom is the device enablement

603
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:00,580
And so that means that when a new device comes out

604
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:04,580
All we need to do is do the device enablement and then it's the same user space that runs on those

605
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:08,260
And so when and when when we want to update an old device

606
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:12,620
We just update the middle section and the device enablement bit stays the same

607
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:20,000
That's a really good approach and you can see it means you don't have that fragmentation that that Android has we have you know

608
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,220
We can have as lots of different devices on the market and they're all effectively running the same code

609
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,660
well, and it seems like it's approachable by just a

610
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:31,360
You know a fairly well organized community could come together and say, all right

611
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:36,580
Well, we'll take on supporting the Nexus 4 for another couple of years or we'll make a Nexus 5 port and me as a more

612
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:41,540
sophisticated user could say you know what I know this community I'll go use their image because if I'm following you the only thing they

613
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:45,180
Would really have to modify would be that first layer that that lower level bits, right?

614
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:50,900
Right, and so someone has already created the Nexus 5 as you know, and you know, it has issues

615
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:57,260
It's not perfect hardware wise we're gonna continue to maintain the Nexus 4 Nexus 7 and Nexus 10 and then what other

616
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:01,260
wherever other devices come along that we have to support, you know for

617
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:05,960
Contractual agreement for things like BQ and Meizu and and and so on

618
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:11,980
So we'll continue to maintain, you know a whole bunch of devices going going forward. Hmm

619
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:12,620
All right

620
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:16,820
I got a couple more questions and then and then I'll open up the moment because I know they have a couple questions

621
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:20,420
This is really I I'm exceptional. I'm exceptionally excited about this because I know we've all I

622
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:25,740
We've all just been watching this and so this is a really exciting first step and I know the BQ phone isn't perfect

623
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:31,540
maybe we'll talk about that too and and kind of get poppies idea on sort of what expectations we should have maybe performance wise and

624
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:36,300
You know battery life and things like that. But first I'll tell you about Linux Academy

625
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,680
Linux Academy is a sponsor that I think is truly great for our audience

626
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,960
And maybe it's I'm a little biased

627
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:49,380
I I believe that when somebody or a group of people are extremely passionate about something if they can line up the right things

628
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:53,140
They can provide an incredible wealth of content and information

629
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:58,340
and I think this is so so perfectly demonstrated with Linux Academy and

630
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:02,540
To sort of validate this theory that I've been thinking of I sort of look at the other

631
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:11,300
Larger outlets for sort of semi equivalent content and it's just a joke. They so obviously are checked out. They're not Linux users

632
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:15,340
They're not passionate about open source. They couldn't care right they're monetizing and that's fine

633
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:16,700
There's just there is room for that

634
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:23,940
But if you're spending your money, why not go somewhere called Linux Academy created by Linux enthusiasts and open source professionals

635
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:28,460
Who truly believe in this stuff who combined with educators and developers to create a platform for you to learn things like?

636
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:33,540
Docker like OpenStack like just DevOps in general pearl python ruby

637
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:41,100
R-sync backups the basic Linux administration Apache engine X they have coursewares on all of this stuff

638
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:44,560
They have live streams that you can watch and ask the educators questions directly

639
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:49,340
You can choose from seven plus Linux distributions. They have scenario based labs at Linux Academy

640
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,460
So not only do they have standard lab servers

641
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:56,380
You'll receive access to their scenario based labs that put you in the middle of tasks common to everyday environments

642
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:59,540
So you'll actually get real experience with these scenario based labs

643
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:02,180
They also have a really really great community

644
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:07,020
So if you're maybe slowing down a little bit or having a downtime that community can kind of give you that boost you need

645
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:11,820
It's really neat and I've been able to kind of jump in there and get my feet wet from time to time and get an idea

646
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:16,380
Of what kind of things I might want to pursue and in fact this recently happened to me with Ruby where I was like

647
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,820
I I feel like maybe it's time

648
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:24,200
I just I don't want to get stagnant maybe keep myself moving forward pick some pick a new skill set to pick up

649
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,320
But I thought you know really probably be very beneficial for me to learn a little development

650
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:31,520
I've always been sort of been able to roughly read some stuff, but I can't really do much more than that

651
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,020
And I thought well we have some Ruby use in-house

652
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:38,620
Maybe I should learn Ruby and it wasn't really until I went to Linux Academy

653
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:43,180
And I saw kids can take five hours and 30 minutes to learn Ruby, and I don't know what I've got

654
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:44,580
I can figure out five hours

655
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:50,460
Like what I put it in that in that terms like I can wrap my brain around that that's a concept I get and

656
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:52,340
They'll let me set up a learning plan

657
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:55,780
So I just say how much time I have and then they'll work with me and they can do the same for you

658
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:57,780
It doesn't matter if you have a little time or a lot of time

659
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:05,420
Linux Academy is where you want to go check them out Linux Academy dot-com slash unplug go over there get our special discount I

660
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:07,900
Think you're gonna be really impressed

661
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:12,660
I think yeah, I know I've been you know I know I've been talking about Linux Academy

662
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,660
I've been talking about learning Ruby, and I'll tell you I

663
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,940
Think that realization for me has just sort of resubmitted

664
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:22,460
Submitted for me why I think this is such a great resource and why it can be such a great resource for you

665
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:25,060
And I want you to try it. I want you to have that moment

666
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,100
It's extremely empowering

667
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:34,300
It gives you a level of control over your future that I I think if you're if you don't have that it's worth going over

668
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:37,220
There and trying it for a little while. I don't have a better way to put it

669
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:40,500
It was it was extremely gratifying to know that I could set a goal for myself

670
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:46,100
And that this was a tool that would help me accomplish that goal, and it's not a bullshit goal either

671
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:51,780
It's actually making myself better educating myself and learning something new I would like all of you to experience that

672
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:55,820
Go over to Linux Academy dot-com slash unplugged

673
00:48:56,380 --> 00:49:00,100
Get our special discount. Thanks to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Linux unplugged show

674
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:05,100
I think you guys be really impressed all right, so mr.. Popey

675
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,420
I got to ask you now we've talked a lot of good stuff

676
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:11,860
Is there any disclaimers you want to make about like expectations like if I buy one of these?

677
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:15,060
Is there maybe gonna be performance issues you think it's gonna work, okay?

678
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:20,580
So the first thing I'd say is don't expect every single app you've got on you know whatever phone

679
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:25,340
You currently use to be there. We we you know we're realistic about this

680
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:30,260
You know we're new to the market, and we don't have the app ecosystem that the other platforms have

681
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:35,460
We just don't yet have the Skype and the what's app. You know they're not there yet, so you do have tell them

682
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:42,260
Yeah, yeah, which is really cool. Yeah, that's a neat mobile app as well. Yeah, it's it's open source

683
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:44,100
It's the codes on launchpad

684
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:49,500
You can you know contribute if you want to if you want to add features that that you've seen in other telegram apps then

685
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:54,460
Knock yourself out, and it even does badge like little numbers for unread messages in there. That's really cool

686
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:58,540
Yeah, and you get notifications and all that alright, so that's a good disclaimer. You're not gonna

687
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:02,420
Have all your apps probably pretty expected you could probably fill in some of the gaps with web apps

688
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:06,580
But it's just probably not quite there. It's not gonna be there for a while, but that's pretty expected. I think

689
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:14,340
Right and and part of this is you know I think some of the stuff we do have

690
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:20,420
Conversations with software vendors all the time you know we have a team of people who are constantly discussing

691
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:26,420
you know you should bring your app to Ubuntu or you should bring your framework to Ubuntu or whatever it is and so we're

692
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:30,620
We're constantly having those conversations, and we know that they're those companies are are

693
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:36,220
Keeping an eye on Ubuntu. Should we say yeah kind of seeing where things go and I

694
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:42,860
Have noticed what what the hell is it about you guys where you managed to get?

695
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:49,460
Just managed to get attention like no other company in the Linux space does like I mentioned to you today on the pre show

696
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:54,420
I was just digging around for stories for tech talk, and I just kept coming up with all these various outlets

697
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:57,060
They're not even really attached to the Linux or the open source community

698
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:02,220
Necessarily talking about it like for example the one that stood out with me this morning was I was going over some Bitcoin headlines

699
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:05,900
And one of the top Bitcoin headlines one of the top stories in Bitcoin today

700
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:10,220
Was the launch of the Ubuntu touch phone and if there was a Bitcoin wallet available for it?

701
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:15,900
Like it's not interesting to just see how it permeates it seems to reach out to a level of consumers

702
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:21,300
It's not like Apple or Microsoft level of reach, but it seems like a wider reach than pretty much

703
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:25,980
Anybody else in the Linux space gets and I've seen a lot more people talking about Ubuntu touch than I would have expected I

704
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:28,980
Think partly the fact that it's that

705
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:32,900
Real Linux device you know yeah, I know

706
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:35,420
Android is Linux at heart really

707
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:41,900
But it is a real Linux device in that you know you can SSH into it and do all the kinds of stupid

708
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:48,220
stuff that you would do on a normal Linux machine and and that actually enables quite a lot of creativity for

709
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:54,420
In terms of what you want to run on the device and and you talking about the Bitcoin wallet

710
00:51:54,420 --> 00:52:00,380
There is a Bitcoin wallet in the store, and it's been in the store for a long long time about 18 months. It's been there

711
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:05,540
Central place I can go to find all the apps available for my Ubuntu phone

712
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:11,060
There is we we haven't made a web front end yet, but someone in the community

713
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:14,620
Looked at our store API and built one for us

714
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:17,900
So there is one and you can go to it

715
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:21,620
And I'll give you the link and you can put it in the show notes and you can browse the apps that are in the

716
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:25,580
Store and you can see the ratings and all the kinds of stuff that you would see on like iTunes

717
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,100
Q5 you had a question right

718
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:34,460
Yeah, now I'm gonna frame this poppy and that let's say this Ubuntu phone is incredibly successful

719
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:35,800
We're five years down the road

720
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:41,820
There's multiple devices out there my question has to do with that because one thing I've noticed with Android devices is you buy a

721
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:48,720
Device you load it up with apps everything runs great a couple years go by even though the you know your hardware is the same

722
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:55,740
The apps run like poo because of the automatic updates the programmers the developers of the applications are now building them for

723
00:52:55,740 --> 00:53:00,420
the newer hardware which then doesn't run on what you have and I'm wondering if as

724
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:06,820
You know Ubuntu has you know older software updates for older repos if there's gonna be something similar on the phone side of things

725
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,020
so that if you get a phone

726
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:12,500
you don't have to worry about a semi planned obsolescence because

727
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:17,500
Applications are being updated and basically update to the point where your hardware can't run them anymore

728
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:21,380
So it's a it's a great question. I've been bitten by that myself

729
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:25,420
I have an iPad first generation and there's half a dozen apps on there

730
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:30,700
I just cannot run anymore because when I first run them they say you need to update me and when you try and update them

731
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:33,460
It says oh you need iOS 7 or you need iOS 8 or something?

732
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,460
And so yeah, I can appreciate that problem

733
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:36,900
one of the

734
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:39,780
One of the issues that there's a few issues one is you know

735
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:45,260
We can't necessarily control what app developers do if they won't if they see a new

736
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:49,140
device that comes on the market that has a 4k screen and

737
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:52,540
128 gig of storage and

738
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:57,580
16 core CPU and they want to do something amazing with that whatever it might be

739
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:02,380
Let's say they make the most amazing touchscreen video editor on Linux on a phone

740
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:08,760
that's got that kind of specs then yeah, I would expect that to run like a pig on the BQ device because this is a

741
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:16,260
960 by 440 display with a few cores and 1 gig of RAM so that you're gonna have a bad time and I don't

742
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:20,980
Think that's our you know department to start telling app developers. No, no, no, no

743
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:27,860
You need to write your your apps as if you're running motif on you know on a Pentium 200 in order to you know

744
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:33,380
Come into our app store. I don't think that's what she we should be doing. We should foster innovation and you know, the

745
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:38,120
Advancement of more complex and fun and interactive and useful applications on the device

746
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:40,740
I don't think we should bring them in in terms of the platform

747
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:43,460
We are trying to keep our platform as lean as possible

748
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:46,160
And as I said before having this as our first device

749
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:50,840
Helps us to get to that goal because we've committed to continue to maintain this

750
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:56,000
Device, it's not like I'm not trying to throw stones but with the

751
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:03,080
Firefox OS first phone that I bought the ZTE open. There's no updates for it. Whereas the Firefox flame

752
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,800
I can move to Firefox OS 2.0

753
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:10,240
But I have no way of doing that that I'm aware of on the ZTE open and we don't want to be in that situation

754
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,240
Where we leave devices behind

755
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:17,560
You know, my question wasn't are you going to force developers to you know, maintain

756
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,160
You know like you can't

757
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:26,520
Do anything newer on your programs because of older devices what I'm specifically asking is will there be a way unlike for instance the Google

758
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,920
Play Store where once an application is updated

759
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:35,120
You do not have the option to reuse the older version if your phone auto updated unless you can somewhere find

760
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:40,160
The APK online to be able to sideload it like will write when an application is updated

761
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:46,400
Will the original older version still be available for those who don't have the money to go out and buy that new 4k?

762
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:51,760
Yeah, that's a good question actually and we're working on the best way to do that

763
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:52,060
Yeah

764
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:54,060
whether we whether we need to support having

765
00:55:54,440 --> 00:56:01,340
multiple different versions of the same app in the store to support different versions of the framework of different versions of the

766
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:05,440
Devices that we've got out in in, you know consumer land

767
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:10,920
we haven't got a solution for that at the moment my workaround is that I

768
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:14,080
Personally mirror all of the clicks in the store every single day

769
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:18,420
So I have a copy of every version of every app that's in the store on my home server

770
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:22,720
You know, that's my personal way of doing it. But yeah, you you

771
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,700
You might be able to manually back up those click packages

772
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:33,760
Yeah, I mean if I wanted the old version of telegram for some reason I could maybe somehow keep that

773
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:39,720
I mean, it's you could we've got the tools you can you can get a click package and you can side load it over a

774
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:42,080
USB cable and just type a command and it installs it

775
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:46,400
You know, I I have done that today installed loads of because I wanted to test the upgrade process

776
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,080
I installed a load of old apps on the phone and then went through the upgrade process

777
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:52,400
So yeah, you can do that kind of thing

778
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:57,820
We do make it possible for you to side load old versions of stuff. Is that something that canonical will try?

779
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:03,020
Well, would they have a problem if someone in the community took up that role of hosting all the older versions?

780
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:04,960
Or would they be okay with that?

781
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,360
well, we got to remember is that the packages in the store are

782
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:15,340
Licensed under certain terms and they're not necessarily all GPL the developers. Yes some of them

783
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:18,580
Yeah, it's up to them whether their apps are you know?

784
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:23,960
Distributable redistributable or not, you know that and now it's something you would have to check, you know

785
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:30,140
There's actually some some decent apps that I use like readability and instant. There's an instant paper web app in here

786
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:33,420
There's a rotten tomatoes. I mean some of these are web apps to be sure but hey

787
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:36,500
You know web apps fine as long as it takes me right to it for the most part

788
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:39,020
I don't need things to be native for like rotten tomatoes

789
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:42,020
Right, and there's a few games, you know

790
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:44,780
We need I I would love for there to be more games on there because you know

791
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:49,200
I'm the same as anyone I sit there and when I'm bored, I pick up my phone and start playing stupid games

792
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:53,340
There's a couple of really good ones. There's one called machines versus machines, which is a really nice

793
00:57:53,340 --> 00:58:01,580
desktop tower defense game which is infuriating and I'm almost a hundred percent certain canonical have lost a lot of productivity over the

794
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:03,580
last

795
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:08,380
Game in there. I like this a lot. This is really neat

796
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:12,060
It is that I'll have a link to this app store website me pulling in the reviews here

797
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:15,700
This is really tiny tiny RSS app. Very nice. Oh, very cool

798
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:19,060
Yeah, I mean the nice thing that that store nobody asked him to do that

799
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:26,300
he just noticed that we had a well-documented API for the store and so he created his own his own web front-end and

800
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:31,580
Put it on github. So anyone can can can do that. I've noticed a couple of other

801
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:34,580
Questions in the IRC. Yeah

802
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:40,020
So and I go go says is there tethering the answer is yes and no there isn't a gooey for at the moment

803
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:44,020
But I think it is possible with a couple of commands. You can tether to the device

804
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:49,540
And we do plan to have it so that you can press buttons in order to tether in the same way

805
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:53,660
You would expect to do that on other devices. And the other question is is there a mobile terminal? Yes

806
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:55,540
Yes, of course there is

807
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:57,540
so it seems like

808
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:00,960
For a lot of us the selection of apps won't be a big deal

809
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:06,780
But for the average consumer like, you know, an audible app is kind of important maybe ways or something like that

810
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:11,500
That's gonna be the big fight, but I guess that only gets solved after some hardware has been on the market for a little while

811
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:18,340
Right. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. And once you've got a couple of those out there and you can go to places like MWC or

812
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:24,500
GDC or you know any of the conferences over the next six months and start waving the device around and say look, you know

813
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:25,860
We've got this

814
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:30,700
open hardware open platform with you know hardware in the in the market and you know

815
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:36,420
Here's our SDK and here are people who've developed apps and here's a selection of code that you could look at to show you

816
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:38,940
How to develop your own apps, maybe we can get people ported

817
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:41,540
I mean, I I thought I understood the difference

818
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:45,420
I thought I understood what a scope was but I got to tell you some of these apps in here that are called scopes

819
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:50,340
Look like apps. I don't know. It's like this gmail scope looks like an app to me, but this is just a scope

820
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:55,700
Right. What does that mean? Yeah, so so the scopes are away, you know when you showed that video earlier

821
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:59,300
Yeah, the the people in the video were just looking at scopes. They were just

822
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:04,660
Take the phone out of the pocket and swipe to one side, right? You just swipe across check what the weather's like

823
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:05,940
It's all about

824
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:11,980
Specific information at your fingertips right kind of like right and think I've explained is Google now without the creepy

825
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:15,860
And the rituals you do every day like, you know

826
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:20,020
You check what the weather's gonna be like before you get before you get up you you know, you might

827
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:24,740
See what appointments you have that day to see whether you need to wear a suit or we can dress down

828
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:31,420
So you check your calendar and you all these kind of little things that ordinarily might be siloed away in lots of different applications

829
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:36,380
Like I have to open the weather app or I have to open my calendar app, right? I have to go and check my email app

830
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:41,380
And and rather than you have to open each of these apps one after the other that information is pushed to the front screen

831
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:45,780
So it's just a case of swipe swipe swipe and you see that information right there

832
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:48,980
I think that's that's the key goal is and that's where the whole you know

833
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:53,180
Your information at your fingertips is just a quick swipe away

834
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:58,740
Big deep in that isn't that what isn't that canonical saying in a way and they're not saying it's bad thing

835
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:00,740
But isn't that canonical in a way saying you know what?

836
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:05,660
Guys some stuff doesn't need to be an app your your stuff is is a feature

837
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:08,340
It's not it's not a dedicated app. Just write a scope

838
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:11,860
It kind of feels like a little bit like saying to developers. Sorry your app

839
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:16,900
I know you want to brand it you want to have a yahoo weather app and you want to give everybody the yahoo weather experience

840
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:21,300
But really people just wanna know if it's gonna rain that she could just be in a scope. Is that kind of the message?

841
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:22,060
Yeah

842
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:26,760
Do you think you know especially is and you can aggregate data from multiple scopes?

843
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:30,740
so, you know, I could say well, I I like the the

844
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:36,340
Weather reports I get from yahoo and I like the weather reports I get from the weather channel

845
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:38,840
But I also like knowing how windy it's gonna be

846
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:43,100
So there's this where this website where I go to find out what the winds gonna be like

847
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:47,700
So when I go surfing, you know, I have a better idea and yahoo don't show me that kind of data

848
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:50,860
So it's nice to be able to aggregate all of that kind of information

849
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:56,620
So you can get multiple perspectives on the same piece of data if that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah, I do like that

850
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:58,700
You get you can get alternative opinions

851
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:04,460
And of course one thing you'd the first app you'd want to get for your Ubuntu touch device is the jupiter broadcasting app

852
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:06,140
Well, of course, obviously

853
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:08,920
Which is pretty cool and it actually resizes pretty well, too

854
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:13,620
I think this is and this app this app is really well done the authors put

855
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:18,260
You know the host information right there and it's just a really well done app. It's really cool

856
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:21,260
It's it's one of the it's I think one of our best mobile apps out there

857
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:25,480
Of course, I love all our mobile apps, but I think it's one of our best on and it's on Ubuntu touch right now

858
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:31,180
So the author of that Simon was actually one of the insiders. We invited him along

859
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:35,180
so he's one of the people who got invited last Friday to come along and get a

860
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:37,700
Phone and the headphones and all that

861
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:44,920
Kind of thank you for yeah, I'm glad because I know working with him on that app

862
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:48,180
He was super excited about the platform or he is super excited about the platform

863
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:52,340
So yeah, and and the other nice thing is what we've said to all these people who came along last Friday

864
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:54,340
It's important to know that they're all they're not all

865
01:02:54,340 --> 01:03:00,860
Yes, men, they're not all people who we've said you must say positive things about Ubuntu. We've given them the phone

866
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:03,360
They can say whatever they like, you know, we've had people

867
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:09,440
Posting YouTube videos telling us that the boot performance is bad. Yeah, telling us that the scrolling performance is bad

868
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:15,780
That's exactly what we want. We want them to tell us their experience not tell us only the positive things

869
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:19,620
Tell us what's wrong with it as well. You gotta fix that stuff too. Yeah, exactly. That's good

870
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:22,980
That's a good outlook to have about it. I think I I

871
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:24,980
I wonder if

872
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:28,540
You know if I even like a podcast app could be a scope thing

873
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:32,100
I mean, that's a fascinating thing that I think I want to play with more as I get the device and I wonder if I

874
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:37,500
Well, yeah, there is a jet. There is a generic cast app that's written by Mike Sheldon

875
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:41,340
He's one of the one of our employees. Is that the bird on screen keyboard?

876
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:45,740
Is that popular? Yeah, and I think he's looking at developing a scope as well

877
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:48,580
So you could just scroll across like first thing in the morning on your commute

878
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:53,300
You just scroll across to your podcast scope and it lists all the you know

879
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:57,540
Upcoming episodes or what's new in the book and you can just hit the button and make play

880
01:03:57,580 --> 01:04:00,980
Rather than having to go screwing around with your podcast. Yeah, so

881
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:04,960
The other thing I think of is and then I'm then I'm then all my questions are done and we can

882
01:04:06,380 --> 01:04:10,040
Wrap up but anyways people are sick of hearing about it. Yeah

883
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:16,300
One of the things like I know whenever we're writing apps for platforms is what kind of what kind of features is the platform?

884
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:18,740
Just gonna give me for free. Can it just do video playback?

885
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:20,460
Like if I just say put a video element here

886
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:23,100
We'll just do video playback or do I have to write the player?

887
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:27,660
Figure out how I'm gonna pull down the mp4 file figure out how I'm gonna break that up and play to the user

888
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:32,380
Especially when I'm moving on connections, is there like, you know, like on iOS there's like a core video

889
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:35,300
I'm a core is there anything like that on a bunch of touch yet? Or is that in development?

890
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:40,620
Yeah, there is so we have a bunch of core services that the platform provides. So for example

891
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:46,700
For example, there's location services so that if you develop a map app, you just request the location and

892
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:53,420
The user gets prompted to say do you want this app to know your location and you accept or deny and yeah

893
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:59,700
Then you're done and the app can then find out your location and that that location detection is provided by our location service

894
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:03,740
Similarly if you if you're writing a podcast app and you want to be able to download

895
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:07,900
You know video podcasts that take a very long time to download

896
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:09,900
you can

897
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:11,260
Use the download service

898
01:05:11,260 --> 01:05:14,260
so when you choose to when the developer chooses to download a

899
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:19,860
Long video podcast it downloads in the background and then when it finishes it signals to the app that it's done

900
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:26,060
What was the other one? Oh media playback. So yeah, we have a media hub, which does audio playback

901
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:30,900
We have video playback as well. And we also have a media scanner service

902
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:32,580
So if you put your music on the device

903
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:37,980
It will scan all your music figure out what the ID three tags are go and get the artwork all that kind of stuff as well

904
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:41,500
Oh, that's really cool. And then last but not least how much do you want?

905
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:44,000
One of these cases that has the cutout for the notification thing

906
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:47,060
That is really cool. No idea that thing existed

907
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:52,300
It turns out the BQ guy who was at the thing last Friday had one and I just didn't notice it

908
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:58,940
He yeah, you touch phone gets its own exclusive phone case with a custom cutout for that little notification ring

909
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:01,300
That's how sweet is that? That's really cool

910
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:06,620
That's awesome. That is neat. All right. Anybody the mum broom have any questions for Pope before we wrap up on the

911
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:11,380
Idea, okay. Go ahead. W. Popey. You can answer not answer. It's totally up to you

912
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:13,540
Okay

913
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:18,920
My questions are if we import this to the US if like one of us decides to

914
01:06:19,220 --> 01:06:23,660
would I be able to like put it on Tang or some other mobile network and

915
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:30,420
how good is like the Wi-Fi on this if let's say I just don't want to use a mobile network and

916
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:34,500
Just use it on Wi-Fi just to contact people online

917
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:40,220
So you could you could get it shipped to the US and in fact, we have some of our employees

918
01:06:40,220 --> 01:06:42,220
Who are in the US who use it?

919
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:48,060
The downside is because the US uses different frequencies for 3G. You'd only get

920
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:51,500
GSM 2G

921
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:54,500
It does have Wi-Fi. So yes, it'll do

922
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:59,740
2.4 I think and 5 gig like I'd have to check that but

923
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:06,820
Yeah, it does. It does Wi-Fi perfectly. I I mine mine is mostly on my my Wi-Fi. Actually, I think it's only 2.4

924
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:10,220
Yeah, it doesn't do 5g. It's 2.4. Okay, so

925
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:14,740
Yeah, that's not too uncommon when you're bringing a phone over kind of depends on what bands are in it

926
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:17,820
I didn't last yeah, it's a bit of a bummer. You know, we get

927
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:22,180
Unfortunately, it's um, it's it's a bit out of our control

928
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:24,180
Okay, I had one last question

929
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:31,020
Could you do you have any insights to share about the integrated traffic data service that's going to be shipping with the phones in the UK?

930
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:35,820
And is that something we're gonna see more of where maybe canonical has a bit of a hole in in

931
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:41,700
Something the phone does that maybe some of the shipping ones already do and so instead you just partner with somebody who does that like

932
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:47,860
Like Ironix here with the traffic data. Can you you know, you know, I I learn about that from OMG

933
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:53,020
I'm too so Joey who runs OMG a bunch who came last Friday as well and you know, he writes a blog post or

934
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:57,420
Tweets about something I think oh, that's cool. I didn't know we did that. Yeah, so

935
01:07:58,020 --> 01:08:01,020
These insiders are not just you know, I don't know

936
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:03,980
Maybe there was an ounce with I missed because we've all been heads down for the phone

937
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:09,540
Yeah, they say they say it's a partnership with I in our X to do or I and Rick's or whatever to do the traffic

938
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:12,220
And I think that when I saw that I was like that seems like hey, you know what?

939
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:14,580
We have a gap here and we can plug it with a partnership

940
01:08:14,580 --> 01:08:19,820
It makes sense to me right and that's exactly what we did for the location services. So we you know, how

941
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:22,340
Android have Google have their own

942
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:30,380
Location services and Apple have their own location services. We partnered with Nokia here for our location services

943
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:34,980
So they provided some software to us that allows us to do the fast fix

944
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:41,220
Location detection so that it does a GPS when you're you know, when you're out and about near Wi-Fi access points

945
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:45,700
It can find you pretty quickly without that. It would take a long time to get a GPS lock. It's

946
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:50,260
Painfully long so we partnered with them. So yeah, there is a there is a precedent for us

947
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:53,820
Partnering with other companies to provide services for the phone. Hmm

948
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:57,900
Okay, any last questions for mr. Pope before we wrap this thing up. I

949
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:01,060
Think you just saw he sold me on it

950
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:04,660
Yeah, oh and we have a torch app. So, you know

951
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:08,620
That base is covered as well. Yes, gotta gotta be able to make sure I can

952
01:09:08,620 --> 01:09:14,100
Find my way in the dark. Yeah, so very cool and exciting to see an actual ship date. So tomorrow's the day

953
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:17,420
Yep

954
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:21,420
Oh my gosh, oh, oh really so then there'll be another so there's gonna be another one later

955
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:26,500
Maybe yeah want I got to figure out what those times are Pacific time

956
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:28,580
And I'm gonna set an alarm and I want to try to get one. I

957
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:35,780
Mean seems like we've all been waiting for so long, right and it's not it's under $200. So it's a pretty good deal

958
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:40,780
Yeah, it's it's pretty cheap really, you know 126 pounds. What is it 169 euros?

959
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:44,500
I don't know what I is in funny money you have over there. Yeah, it's not it's not

960
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:48,100
Expensive. No, it's pretty cool to see it actually come to fruition

961
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:54,100
All right. Well, I think we'll wrap it up right there and if I get one eventually

962
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:56,620
I'll give you a review

963
01:09:56,620 --> 01:10:00,660
However, it is and I'll watch it as it goes like I kind of other reason I kind of want to beat you so I

964
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:03,540
Can get the you know, I can get updates and kind of track the price of the phone

965
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:07,940
So I can get the you know, I can get updates and kind of track the progress as the platform matures because there's gonna be things

966
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:11,340
It'll be pushed out as you know, they find stuff and it'd be good to keep track of that

967
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:17,380
So very true. I'll give you a report next week. If I managed to grab one. It's already tomorrow here says Juba in the chat room

968
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:22,100
Well, that's true. That's a little confusing and the people could be listening at any time. We're talking to people in the future

969
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:26,140
I mean, how cool is that? We're time travelers. That's right. We're time travelers. We'll put Rogers

970
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:31,220
Thank you for letting us pick your brain all that. Yeah, it was a it was a good download of information

971
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:38,140
Yeah, thank you. Cheers guys. Yeah, congratulations to you and everybody over there to cannot seem for working your asses off to get this far

972
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:42,580
I think if nothing else, that's a hell of an accomplishment and just right there. All right

973
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:46,540
Well, then we'll wrap it up here on the Linux unplugged show. We'd love to have you visit us

974
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:51,140
Why don't you join us? You know, you could do this with us. Yeah, you could come over to the website Tuesdays

975
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:52,100
We start at 2 p.m

976
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:57,420
Pacific you go to Jupiter broadcasting comm slash counter to get that in your local time zone and join us in that there IRC

977
01:10:57,420 --> 01:11:01,340
Chat room share your opinions as we go or even better join us in the mobile room

978
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:05,120
maybe we can hear you and what you actually think about these things because I think

979
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:10,700
We have a pretty smart audience. You probably have a pretty educated opinion on a lot of this stuff. Why not contribute?

980
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:15,980
We're just gonna check your mic. You can also go to Linux action show dot reddit.com and submit content that way Matt

981
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:20,780
Have a great week. I'll talk to you next week. Sounds good. See you then. All right, everybody

982
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:27,820
Thanks so much for to this week's episode of Linux unplugged. We'll see you right back here next Tuesday

983
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:52,780
Okay, I've got a

984
01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:10,900
$10,000 ethernet cable to sell you. Are you ready for this for a $10,000 internet cable? Yeah, let me get my checkbook

985
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:12,620
Now here's the good thing Matt

986
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:15,780
If you if you're willing to pay ten thousand dollars for this ethernet cable

987
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:21,620
Not only am I gonna include data in this ethernet cable, but for no additional charge on top of the 10,000

988
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:27,380
I'm also gonna give you high fidelity audio. Hmm. No, I just better be a unidirectional one

989
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:29,380
Cuz I don't want any of your cheap bi-directional

990
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:35,940
Now that I've got you interested I should probably disclaim it's actually ten thousand five hundred dollars for this cable

991
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:42,100
It's got an RJ 45 connector made from silver with tabs that are virtually unbreakable

992
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:46,900
The plug comes with the added strain relief and a firm lock to keep it in place that way

993
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:52,260
No critical data is lost silver, huh? I'm gonna wager. This is put out by monster. I'm just call that a hunch

994
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:57,860
You know what they're doing all this crap. Oh my gosh makes it sound better. Wow

995
01:12:57,860 --> 01:13:02,420
It does look amazing though. This does look like that. It's got a really cool braided cable, too

996
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:08,140
This is the coolest looking HD or ethernet cable. I've ever seen I'd probably wear it like mr. T. I'll be honest with you

997
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:12,860
Audio quest diamond. Yeah, you could it would be a piece of jewelry. All right, JB titles calm

998
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:17,180
Yeah, I have a feeling it's gonna be something to do with the Ubuntu phone. I don't know could be yeah

999
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:23,740
Yeah, so, you know how you know how I talk about Chrome and how I like Chrome. Oh, you're a Chrome maniac

1000
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:30,780
Yeah, so over the weekend my Chrome profile just got corrupted for some reason and now every time I launch Chrome

1001
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:33,500
it thinks it's launched for the first time ever which

1002
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:40,140
It's not like an unusable because it sinks so well and so fast that all of my stuff sinks back

1003
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:43,680
but the one thing I really end up missing is my URL

1004
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:50,840
Autocompletion and the reason why that's handy is turns out like I need to type while I'm doing a podcast often and it's really nice

1005
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:56,500
If I could just type in JB T and then JB titles is automatically and I just enter so that way I don't otherwise

1006
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:58,500
I'm over here going like hey, welcome to

1007
01:13:58,740 --> 01:14:00,500
Hold on. I got it

1008
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:06,580
Hold on. I'm typing. All right. Welcome to the show. No, did you not restore your Chrome profile from your backup?

1009
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:09,180
my what

1010
01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:13,260
Well, it's a fun trick that I've used I've never done this on chroma

1011
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:17,460
I used to do it in Firefox a lot and I keep like multiple I I create when I

1012
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:22,980
Profile. Yeah, and then I got all my autocompletes done and then I move them away and that way when it goes to crap and it

1013
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:24,980
Will there you go?

1014
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:31,420
I'm paranoid now. We're tinfoil hats. Ubuntu is calling is not bad. Ubuntu phones arrivals also pretty good

1015
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:36,340
I like both of those. I like Ubuntu calling. It's cool. Ubuntu is calling

1016
01:14:36,980 --> 01:14:41,980
Very Avon. It's kind of working for me the Ubuntu blob phone. Oh my gosh. It's already starting

1017
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:53,740
Yep, yep, ahoy Ubuntu. All right, JBtitles.com suck my googs. No, I suck my googs. Oh boy

1018
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:59,020
Yeah, and I just got that out of my brain too. Oh, right. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, man

1019
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:05,300
You guys hey might as well my you know what we started with it. We might as well end with it, right?
