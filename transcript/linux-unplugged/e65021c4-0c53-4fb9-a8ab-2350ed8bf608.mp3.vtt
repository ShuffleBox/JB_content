WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.040
Listen closely, there's an embedded message in this music.

00:04.040 --> 00:11.880
All right, there's the source.

00:11.880 --> 00:14.080
Now listen carefully for the message.

00:14.080 --> 00:21.400
Did you hear it, Wes?

00:21.400 --> 00:23.400
You know, I think I heard something.

00:23.400 --> 00:25.720
Yeah, there is a little bit of a difference there.

00:25.720 --> 00:34.000
There is data hiding in the 9.8 kilohertz to 10 kilohertz audio spectrum in that sample

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
that we just played.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
Wow.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.280
You know, considering it sounds pretty decent, I think.

00:38.280 --> 00:42.440
Yeah, well, one of the tricks they're doing is they're analyzing the music and then they're

00:42.440 --> 00:45.680
encoding data into the audible range of the music.

00:45.680 --> 00:51.640
So picture a moment, like transferring information via sound, as we all know modems used to do

00:51.640 --> 00:52.640
that.

00:52.640 --> 00:56.120
What if you could have smartphones that are always listening to the background music that's

00:56.120 --> 00:57.720
playing, like your Pixel 3 does?

00:57.720 --> 00:58.720
Oh, yes it does.

00:58.720 --> 01:00.160
And it's only a little bit creepy.

01:00.160 --> 01:05.400
Now what if you could transmit information in that music, like the coffee shop Wi-Fi

01:05.400 --> 01:06.400
password?

01:06.400 --> 01:11.140
Oh, so you just step into the coffee shop, the music's been altered just a little bit

01:11.140 --> 01:15.480
to encode the password, say, and then your phone picks it up, registers, finds the network,

01:15.480 --> 01:16.480
hops on in your own life.

01:16.480 --> 01:19.720
Wes, this isn't just a theory, why, it's a white paper too.

01:19.720 --> 01:23.200
Yeah, I thought this was really interesting, man.

01:23.200 --> 01:27.240
Obviously, there's so many other implications when you're just spewing this stuff out in

01:27.240 --> 01:29.940
the air and what your phone can pick up.

01:29.940 --> 01:34.720
But I thought it was a pretty interesting way of, you know, encoding these sorts of

01:34.720 --> 01:39.480
things that we all use on a daily basis in our surrounding audio.

01:39.480 --> 01:42.320
And they pointed out like, why use audio frequencies, right?

01:42.320 --> 01:43.960
Why not use a frequency that we can't hear?

01:43.960 --> 01:47.840
And basically, there's already, there's just a lot of speakers for the human audio range

01:47.840 --> 01:48.840
already.

01:48.840 --> 01:53.440
So you have speakers in the ceiling that are designed to pipe out music in that range at

01:53.440 --> 01:54.440
the mall.

01:54.440 --> 01:58.240
Yeah, you're not going to get fantastic data rates here.

01:58.240 --> 02:04.120
Real world data transfer would be around 200 bits a second.

02:04.120 --> 02:08.520
So that's, I think, if I'm doing my math right, about 25 words per second.

02:08.520 --> 02:11.520
So a good Wi-Fi password, but that's about it.

02:11.520 --> 02:13.560
Yeah, something like an audio QR code.

02:13.560 --> 02:16.940
Yeah, an audio QR code is exactly what it would be.

02:16.940 --> 02:27.680
What could go wrong, Wes?

02:27.680 --> 02:31.640
Hello and welcome to Linux Unplugged episode 311.

02:31.640 --> 02:32.640
My name is Chris.

02:32.640 --> 02:33.640
My name is Wes.

02:33.640 --> 02:34.640
Hello, Wes.

02:34.640 --> 02:35.640
We have a great episode today.

02:35.640 --> 02:39.840
So not only are we going to get to some important community news, I've had a think recently

02:39.840 --> 02:40.840
about the community news.

02:40.840 --> 02:41.840
Oh boy.

02:41.840 --> 02:44.800
So this is a slightly retuned community news, this edition.

02:44.800 --> 02:50.200
Thomas Cameron is joining us on this week's episode, and if that name rings a bell, that's

02:50.200 --> 02:58.000
because back in episode 304, we talked about Texas Linux Fest and a keynote that really

02:58.000 --> 03:00.040
made us think.

03:00.040 --> 03:03.320
Everyone on the team was impressed by this keynote, and that was the one that was given

03:03.320 --> 03:06.360
by Thomas Cameron, and he joins us this week on the show.

03:06.360 --> 03:07.360
Hey there, Thomas.

03:07.360 --> 03:10.240
Hey, thank you so much for having me, and thank you for the kind words.

03:10.240 --> 03:11.240
I appreciate it.

03:11.240 --> 03:12.240
No, really.

03:12.240 --> 03:13.240
Thank you for joining us.

03:13.240 --> 03:16.760
This is something that we've been wanting to do.

03:16.760 --> 03:21.320
Both Wes and I didn't talk about it ahead of time, but on the way into the studio today,

03:21.320 --> 03:25.200
listened to your keynote again, because we have a recording of it, because we just enjoyed

03:25.200 --> 03:26.200
it so much.

03:26.200 --> 03:30.640
So thank you for making it, and as we go through the community news here and stuff, please

03:30.640 --> 03:35.240
feel free to chime in, and then after we get through this community news, let's just chat

03:35.240 --> 03:37.760
about some of the topics you raised in your keynote.

03:37.760 --> 03:40.840
We'll just kind of expand on them a little bit and things like that.

03:40.840 --> 03:41.840
Sounds good.

03:41.840 --> 03:42.840
All right.

03:42.840 --> 03:46.560
So before we get to that community news, I have to say time-appropriate greetings to

03:46.560 --> 03:47.560
that mumble room.

03:47.560 --> 03:48.560
Hello, Virtual Lug.

03:48.560 --> 03:49.560
Good evening.

03:49.560 --> 03:50.560
Hello.

03:50.560 --> 03:51.560
Hello.

03:51.560 --> 03:52.560
Hello.

03:52.560 --> 03:53.560
That's a packed mumble room.

03:53.560 --> 03:55.560
And of course, Mr. Cheese Bacon's here.

03:55.560 --> 03:56.560
Hello, Cheese.

03:56.560 --> 03:57.560
Hey, how's it going, man?

03:57.560 --> 03:58.560
Hey, Chasey.

03:58.560 --> 03:59.560
Good.

03:59.560 --> 04:00.560
Good.

04:00.560 --> 04:01.560
Really good.

04:01.560 --> 04:02.560
Just got back from Montana.

04:02.560 --> 04:06.000
Decided to do something that I think I'm going to do more often when I do a family trip,

04:06.000 --> 04:10.120
because I took the family to Montana, and then I thought, you know, when I get back,

04:10.120 --> 04:13.760
the week I get back, instead of just jumping right back into work, what if I kind of like

04:13.760 --> 04:14.760
ease in a little bit?

04:14.760 --> 04:15.760
Oh, the ease in.

04:15.760 --> 04:16.760
Interesting.

04:16.760 --> 04:17.760
The ease in.

04:17.760 --> 04:18.760
You know, I slide in a little bit.

04:18.760 --> 04:19.760
So I...

04:19.760 --> 04:20.760
Phase in, you might say.

04:20.760 --> 04:23.480
I booked a campsite on a river in eastern Washington.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.560
I don't know if that's phasing in.

04:25.560 --> 04:27.120
I think that's just more vacation.

04:27.120 --> 04:29.120
Well, I'm in studio, aren't I?

04:29.120 --> 04:30.120
Yes, you are.

04:30.120 --> 04:33.520
I did the three-hour commute in today just because Thomas is here.

04:33.520 --> 04:34.520
Seriously.

04:34.520 --> 04:37.520
If Thomas wasn't here, I would have been like, I'll do it remote.

04:37.520 --> 04:38.520
Screw it.

04:38.520 --> 04:39.520
Is that a river behind you?

04:39.520 --> 04:40.520
Yeah.

04:40.520 --> 04:41.520
That is the river.

04:41.520 --> 04:42.520
That would have been Joe's like, Joe.

04:42.520 --> 04:46.960
Joe would have contacted me like, Chris, this river noise, I can't filter it out.

04:46.960 --> 04:47.960
That's my Joe impression.

04:47.960 --> 04:48.960
It's very bad.

04:48.960 --> 04:55.240
Anyways, moving on, let's talk about these Dropbox updates that people have been tweeting

04:55.240 --> 04:59.400
me saying, well, now Chris is going to switch back to Dropbox now that this news is out.

04:59.400 --> 05:00.400
Wrong.

05:00.400 --> 05:07.040
But it is good to see, nonetheless, Dropbox is adding back-end support for ZFS, eCryptFS,

05:07.040 --> 05:10.200
and XFS and ButterFS on Linux.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.400
Look at that.

05:11.400 --> 05:12.400
Didn't expect that to happen.

05:12.400 --> 05:13.960
I mean, is that like a little awkward?

05:13.960 --> 05:14.960
Have they said anything?

05:14.960 --> 05:18.240
Or is it just sort of people are noticing that the support's back?

05:18.240 --> 05:19.240
That.

05:19.240 --> 05:20.240
Yeah.

05:20.240 --> 05:21.240
Feels weird, right?

05:21.240 --> 05:22.240
Yeah.

05:22.240 --> 05:24.040
Are there changes in the justifications they gave for dropping it?

05:24.040 --> 05:27.400
No, it's just changes in the release notes for a beta version.

05:27.400 --> 05:30.280
This is so late, really, if you think about it.

05:30.280 --> 05:31.280
Exactly, right, Brent?

05:31.280 --> 05:33.640
It's like, it's too late.

05:33.640 --> 05:35.360
It was the last straw, wasn't it?

05:35.360 --> 05:36.480
It was by far the last straw.

05:36.480 --> 05:39.800
I mean, how many people just kind of said, all right, I'm out of here.

05:39.800 --> 05:40.800
See ya.

05:40.800 --> 05:44.480
You gave me a good reason to work a little harder at finding a better solution.

05:44.480 --> 05:46.400
So I think they lost a lot of people.

05:46.400 --> 05:51.180
Well, and I'll tell you, one of the things about desktop Linux is sometimes we get the

05:51.180 --> 05:52.700
features last.

05:52.700 --> 05:56.580
And that can actually be, in some cases, a good thing, especially if you want a reliable

05:56.580 --> 05:59.700
workstation that is predictable.

05:59.700 --> 06:05.280
And on Windows and Mac OS, and you've got to imagine eventually this would land on Linux,

06:05.280 --> 06:09.680
but on Windows and Mac OS, things have gotten really bad in Dropbox town.

06:09.680 --> 06:13.860
So Dropbox now uses over a half a gig of memory on Mac OS.

06:13.860 --> 06:18.660
And when you look in its frameworks folder in the application bundle, there's an entire

06:18.660 --> 06:20.960
Chromium web rendering engine in there.

06:20.960 --> 06:27.240
And they've implemented an electron-based file manager in Dropbox on Mac OS.

06:27.240 --> 06:28.240
Can you believe that?

06:28.240 --> 06:29.240
I mean, I knew it was coming.

06:29.240 --> 06:31.000
I mean, it just had to be.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.600
I didn't think Dropbox would be the one to do it.

06:33.600 --> 06:41.160
I mean, Dropbox went from super lightweight cross-platform sync tool to the most bloated

06:41.160 --> 06:42.160
sync tool possible.

06:42.160 --> 06:44.120
Well, it's a whole service, Chris.

06:44.120 --> 06:45.680
It's not just about syncing anymore.

06:45.680 --> 06:50.200
I mean, one of the things that I was resistant about Nextcloud was it just felt like it was

06:50.200 --> 06:51.880
too much stuff besides file syncing.

06:51.880 --> 06:52.880
Right.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.400
You just want some files and to have them everywhere.

06:54.400 --> 06:57.120
I had a change of heart and I realized there was other things I could take advantage of

06:57.120 --> 06:58.820
and then Nextcloud was a slam dunk.

06:58.820 --> 07:04.160
But now looking at this, I'm thinking, man, the trade-off is actually still there.

07:04.160 --> 07:06.080
Like Dropbox is too much.

07:06.080 --> 07:10.140
With the price, if you want real storage, if you want more than three devices, half

07:10.140 --> 07:15.360
a gig of memory just for their stupid electron file manager, and then the fact that Linux

07:15.360 --> 07:18.840
feels like a second or maybe even third-class platform.

07:18.840 --> 07:26.360
Thomas, as our special guest here on the Unplugged program, I'm curious what your sync solution

07:26.360 --> 07:27.360
is.

07:27.360 --> 07:30.600
Do you have anything that syncs to the cloud?

07:30.600 --> 07:31.600
I do.

07:31.600 --> 07:32.600
I do.

07:32.600 --> 07:34.720
My wife and I both have backup routines.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.320
She's on a Windows laptop.

07:36.320 --> 07:39.480
I obviously am on a Linux system.

07:39.480 --> 07:43.760
I hate to say it, man, I'm sort of old-fashioned.

07:43.760 --> 07:49.600
I have an rsync script that runs on my laptop that checks to see if it's docked at home.

07:49.600 --> 07:54.400
If it's docked at home, it syncs over to my file server.

07:54.400 --> 07:59.920
Once it's done that, then that file server syncs to some cloud instances that I have.

07:59.920 --> 08:03.440
My wife uses a commercial cloud storage solution.

08:03.440 --> 08:05.640
I don't even remember what it is.

08:05.640 --> 08:13.080
We do use cloud storage, definitely, but in both cases, it's not very sophisticated.

08:13.080 --> 08:18.900
There's something nice about using rsync to move your data around because it's easier

08:18.900 --> 08:23.280
to observe, it's easier to understand, so you feel a little safer about your own data

08:23.280 --> 08:25.400
because it's a tool you can wrap your head around.

08:25.400 --> 08:26.400
Exactly.

08:26.400 --> 08:30.720
When you're writing it, you're writing your script and you're saying, I want this data

08:30.720 --> 08:35.240
to go over to this internal server versus this data, which absolutely has to go to the

08:35.240 --> 08:39.620
cloud immediately because it's very important and we don't want to lose it.

08:39.620 --> 08:44.840
It's like, I know exactly what the software is doing because I wrote it.

08:44.840 --> 08:49.600
And you only have yourself to blame, which I'm used to doing that, so that's not so bad.

08:49.600 --> 08:51.080
I actually like that.

08:51.080 --> 08:52.080
That's fine by me.

08:52.080 --> 08:53.520
I'd be okay in that scenario.

08:53.520 --> 08:57.700
Are you using any kind of secret sauce for your laptop and rsync to figure out when you're

08:57.700 --> 09:00.800
on the homeland versus when you're on a hotel Wi-Fi or something?

09:00.800 --> 09:01.800
Yeah.

09:01.800 --> 09:03.640
Honestly, I do a couple of different things.

09:03.640 --> 09:07.600
I look to see if I'm in the right address range, and I use kind of an oddball address

09:07.600 --> 09:09.280
range for my home lab.

09:09.280 --> 09:16.360
And then I also check to see if the slash etsy slash resolve.conf is set up to search

09:16.360 --> 09:18.160
on my home office domain.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.160
Home DNS.

09:19.160 --> 09:20.160
Right.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.160
Right.

09:21.160 --> 09:22.160
So that's what it is.

09:22.160 --> 09:25.520
And if my host name is correct, so I do a number of tests, but yeah, if I'm on the right

09:25.520 --> 09:29.960
network and the host name that's been assigned is a host name that I recognize because I've

09:29.960 --> 09:36.240
got static DHCP reservations and my resolve.conf says that I'm in the right search domain,

09:36.240 --> 09:38.720
then it fires off the rsync script.

09:38.720 --> 09:40.240
That's a solid way to do it.

09:40.240 --> 09:41.600
That is a really solid way to do it.

09:41.600 --> 09:45.600
Well, and because I'm an idiot, it's great that it's hands free.

09:45.600 --> 09:46.600
Yes.

09:46.600 --> 09:47.600
Yeah.

09:47.600 --> 09:48.600
Yeah.

09:48.600 --> 09:49.600
Just let it go.

09:49.600 --> 09:50.600
That's right.

09:50.600 --> 09:52.480
Because if those conditions exist, then it runs.

09:52.480 --> 09:53.480
Yep.

09:53.480 --> 09:54.480
Yeah, that's nice.

09:54.480 --> 09:56.800
That's how you want your backups to be really.

09:56.800 --> 09:59.640
There's absolutely nothing wrong with that setup.

09:59.640 --> 10:02.440
It's similar to how I back up my photos now.

10:02.440 --> 10:07.080
So it's not quite, I don't have the network detection stuff because mine's just always

10:07.080 --> 10:08.080
here on the land.

10:08.080 --> 10:09.400
But I like that.

10:09.400 --> 10:12.400
So Thomas, I know you're a long time Red Hatter.

10:12.400 --> 10:16.800
If I recall from the keynote, you were certified in 1999.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.520
So you've been around for a while.

10:18.520 --> 10:19.520
Yeah.

10:19.520 --> 10:27.080
My first installation of Linux was back in, gosh, 1995, I think.

10:27.080 --> 10:34.040
It was the first version of Slackware that supported the A.out format.

10:34.040 --> 10:35.040
Oh, wow.

10:35.040 --> 10:36.040
Yeah.

10:36.040 --> 10:37.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:37.040 --> 10:38.120
So I mean, it's been a while.

10:38.120 --> 10:41.800
And then when I went to, actually, before I went to work at Red Hat, I was a Red Hat

10:41.800 --> 10:45.480
certified engineer on Red Hat Linux 6.1.

10:45.480 --> 10:51.040
And then while I worked at Red Hat, I was a Red Hat certified architect level five, which

10:51.040 --> 10:54.780
means that I didn't just pass the tests to become an RHCA.

10:54.780 --> 10:59.320
But then I took five additional technical tests after that and passed all of those.

10:59.320 --> 11:00.800
So big old geek.

11:00.800 --> 11:07.600
And as we talk today, if memory serves, you are an Amazon Linux solutions architect, correct?

11:07.600 --> 11:08.600
Correct.

11:08.600 --> 11:09.600
Yes.

11:09.600 --> 11:16.080
So I started out after almost 14 years, about four months ago, and started with AWS, the

11:16.080 --> 11:17.880
Amazon Web Services.

11:17.880 --> 11:20.880
And I get to play with Amazon Linux all day, every day.

11:20.880 --> 11:22.540
And it's a lot of fun.

11:22.540 --> 11:23.540
It's a whole lot of fun.

11:23.540 --> 11:24.540
Interesting.

11:24.540 --> 11:27.720
I'd like to talk more about that in a moment, because that's something I got to be honest

11:27.720 --> 11:28.720
with you.

11:28.720 --> 11:29.720
We don't cover much on this show.

11:29.720 --> 11:30.720
Yeah.

11:30.720 --> 11:32.800
And Wes and I feel a little embarrassed about that, because it's out there.

11:32.800 --> 11:37.840
A lot of people are using it, and it's getting about zero coverage.

11:37.840 --> 11:38.840
Let's get to there in a moment.

11:38.840 --> 11:42.400
But I kind of want to take a little bit of a historical perspective on this next story

11:42.400 --> 11:43.400
with you.

11:43.400 --> 11:44.400
Sure.

11:44.400 --> 11:51.040
So this week, it was approved by the Fedora technical committee to discontinue shipping

11:51.040 --> 11:53.880
32-bit ISOs.

11:53.880 --> 11:58.520
And they're also debating an additional, even further step.

11:58.520 --> 11:59.520
Oh, yes.

11:59.520 --> 12:05.200
So they also started talking about when should they end 32-bit software repositories in general

12:05.200 --> 12:06.560
for Fedora.

12:06.560 --> 12:11.240
So they will consider a late change proposal for Fedora 31.

12:11.240 --> 12:17.520
And as a result, there is now the no i686 repositories proposal that was drafted where

12:17.520 --> 12:22.640
they would stop producing and distributing modular and everything i686 repositories.

12:22.640 --> 12:28.080
And this 32-bit transition has just been one of the continuing meta stories of 2019.

12:28.080 --> 12:33.520
And I'm just really fascinated on your entire take on the bigger picture here, the bigger

12:33.520 --> 12:34.520
story.

12:34.520 --> 12:42.880
You know, the systems that run 32-bit architecture are becoming so few and so far between and

12:42.880 --> 12:45.200
frankly so specialized, right?

12:45.200 --> 12:51.520
Usually we're talking about industrial machines or special purpose machines.

12:51.520 --> 12:58.200
And Fedora is at its heart meant to be a general purpose distribution.

12:58.200 --> 13:05.560
And so I kind of understand the logic behind saying, look, you know, you pretty much can't

13:05.560 --> 13:08.440
buy a 32-bit machine anymore.

13:08.440 --> 13:13.440
So we're not going to burn the effort and the engineering effort and all of the build

13:13.440 --> 13:20.440
systems and all of the storage and all of the overhead that comes with keeping 32-bit

13:20.440 --> 13:27.600
distributions alive for something that is really a niche sort of specialized platform.

13:27.600 --> 13:30.160
So I kind of agree with them, honestly.

13:30.160 --> 13:31.160
Same with me.

13:31.160 --> 13:37.200
I feel like you need a couple of distributions to start pushing this forward.

13:37.200 --> 13:42.840
And Fedora is a great distribution for that kind of tech, pushing a new tech forward.

13:42.840 --> 13:43.840
Okay.

13:43.840 --> 13:46.940
So, you know, you and I are both long timers.

13:46.940 --> 13:48.600
You've got more time on this than I do.

13:48.600 --> 13:53.600
And I'm curious to get your perspective on why when Canonical announced something somewhat

13:53.600 --> 14:02.020
similar, although in a different style, there was a pretty big outrage, in fact, a weekend

14:02.020 --> 14:06.720
of outrage that just where people were popping off for a weekend, 60 different articles were

14:06.720 --> 14:08.260
written.

14:08.260 --> 14:13.120
When this gets announced by Fedora, there's like three articles and two of them were by

14:13.120 --> 14:15.520
Feronix.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.320
What's with the tonal difference, do you think?

14:17.320 --> 14:23.240
Well, I think that you hit the nail on the head when you said they announced it differently.

14:23.240 --> 14:27.640
With the Fedora project, it is a project and it is a represented project.

14:27.640 --> 14:30.560
And by that, I mean, there are folks from the community who are represented.

14:30.560 --> 14:37.000
There are, you know, over communication with a lot of the development mailing lists.

14:37.000 --> 14:43.800
And so I think that the idea of doing away with 32-bit builds was socialized for a long

14:43.800 --> 14:50.560
time before the announcement was sort of broadly broadcast, if that makes sense.

14:50.560 --> 14:55.880
And I think that the way that it was communicated and I think that the rationale behind it,

14:55.880 --> 15:01.160
kind of what we talked about just a minute ago, I think that most folks out in Fedora

15:01.160 --> 15:03.280
land were like, yeah, that makes sense.

15:03.280 --> 15:06.360
I mean, Fedora is a forward looking distro.

15:06.360 --> 15:09.400
It's for bleeding edge cool technologies.

15:09.400 --> 15:11.460
It's for as close to upstream as possible.

15:11.460 --> 15:16.160
And a lot of the stuff that's upstream just doesn't lend itself to 32-bit.

15:16.160 --> 15:19.280
So I think it was all in the way that it was communicated personally.

15:19.280 --> 15:24.680
A flip side question to that then would be, do you think that inherently makes Fedora

15:24.680 --> 15:30.360
less of a corporate desktop platform where Ubuntu LTS seems like you had companies like

15:30.360 --> 15:38.100
Valve and game developers that were almost, they were dependent on it as a desktop platform

15:38.100 --> 15:42.320
where they don't seem to depend on Fedora as a desktop platform as much?

15:42.320 --> 15:48.840
Well, you know, look at having been in corporate IT, you and I both have been in those environments

15:48.840 --> 15:55.160
where if somebody came to me and said, hey, we're just going to upgrade every desktop

15:55.160 --> 16:01.880
in the place that does precision computing or CAD cam or whatever every six months because

16:01.880 --> 16:07.000
the underlying distro revs every six months, I would be like, I'm either going to stab

16:07.000 --> 16:09.480
you or I'm going to open my veins.

16:09.480 --> 16:10.480
Go mental.

16:10.480 --> 16:11.480
Yeah.

16:11.480 --> 16:15.520
So Fedora is designed for sort of bleeding edge developers.

16:15.520 --> 16:16.840
It's a phenomenal desktop.

16:16.840 --> 16:21.640
I use Fedora on my desktop at home and love it.

16:21.640 --> 16:28.840
Whereas LTS is absolutely designed to be a solid, less flashy, sexy, forward-looking

16:28.840 --> 16:30.400
desktop that's going to last for a long time.

16:30.400 --> 16:38.120
And I totally get why folks would use LTS or Ubuntu LTS as opposed to Fedora.

16:38.120 --> 16:39.120
Yeah.

16:39.120 --> 16:42.720
And that could be more appealing to developers from a targeting standpoint because sometimes

16:42.720 --> 16:45.520
projects can have a multi-year lifespan.

16:45.520 --> 16:49.200
Wimpy, I want to give you a chance to jump in here just because I know that this is a

16:49.200 --> 16:51.480
topic that's close to your heart.

16:51.480 --> 16:55.160
You see the reaction differences, the tone differences between Fedora's announcement

16:55.160 --> 16:58.800
and Ubuntu slash Canonical's announcement.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.200
What are your thoughts on that?

17:00.200 --> 17:05.880
I haven't actually seen the announcement from Fedora, so I can't comment on the differences

17:05.880 --> 17:08.120
as to how it was communicated.

17:08.120 --> 17:14.840
If I could, I should take this moment to make clear that the dropping the I680, the 32-bit

17:14.840 --> 17:17.600
repositories and all of that is likely not to happen.

17:17.600 --> 17:18.680
It's a proposal.

17:18.680 --> 17:22.000
It's a proposal that is seeing significant pushback.

17:22.000 --> 17:27.800
But the dropping of 32-bit ISOs and things like that is very likely to happen.

17:27.800 --> 17:31.680
All of which has been pretty much, I think, well received overall.

17:31.680 --> 17:38.720
I am not at all surprised to hear people not caring about the removal of the ISO images

17:38.720 --> 17:41.320
for 32-bit Intel platforms.

17:41.320 --> 17:49.360
I think for those people that need that kind of support, there are plenty of niche distros

17:49.360 --> 17:56.440
that cater to that use case, and it doesn't need the likes of Ubuntu and Fedora to cater

17:56.440 --> 17:58.200
to those individuals.

17:58.200 --> 18:05.400
There are plenty of other places you can go because we're getting into enthusiast territory

18:05.400 --> 18:06.400
now.

18:06.400 --> 18:10.960
These systems are getting old enough, it won't be so long before they'll be retro and there'll

18:10.960 --> 18:18.400
be a slew of YouTube channels about preserving their 32-bit Intel systems.

18:18.400 --> 18:23.960
Let's leave that to the enthusiasts and the retro computer lovers, and let's leave the

18:23.960 --> 18:30.200
mainstream distributions to look to the horizon and march forward.

18:30.200 --> 18:31.200
Well said.

18:31.200 --> 18:32.800
Well said.

18:32.800 --> 18:35.160
How are things over in Ubuntu MATE land these days?

18:35.160 --> 18:38.440
Ubuntu MATE land, yes, very good.

18:38.440 --> 18:47.280
I've spent some time recently creating bespoke images for some more ultra-mobile PC devices.

18:47.280 --> 18:51.240
I heard a little bit about that on that there Ubuntu podcast recently.

18:51.240 --> 19:02.000
Yeah, so GPD sent me an engineering sample of their GPD MicroPC that has been going through

19:02.000 --> 19:08.040
a crowd funder and those devices are currently being shipped to their backers at the moment.

19:08.040 --> 19:14.240
And thanks to the collaboration from Hans de Goode at Red Hat, kernel support for those

19:14.240 --> 19:17.760
devices is in the 5.2 kernel.

19:17.760 --> 19:25.320
The 5.2 kernel landed in the 1910 development branch of Ubuntu, so I put together an alpha

19:25.320 --> 19:29.600
release for that so that people that have got those devices and want some Linux rather

19:29.600 --> 19:31.880
than some Windows have got somewhere to go.

19:31.880 --> 19:32.880
That's great.

19:32.880 --> 19:37.960
And as we progress through the rest of the 1910 cycle, I'll produce a beta image in

19:37.960 --> 19:41.160
then a final image for that device.

19:41.160 --> 19:46.440
That is, you know what, there's something in 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4 I am excited about.

19:46.440 --> 19:47.440
No kidding.

19:47.440 --> 19:48.440
It's getting really good.

19:48.440 --> 19:52.980
So let's take a moment to have Alex bring us down a little bit from the 5.2 hype because

19:52.980 --> 19:58.560
there is a bug that is impacting those of us that are enjoying the KVM lifestyle these

19:58.560 --> 19:59.560
days.

19:59.560 --> 20:05.760
Yeah, was it 3.08 or 3.09, I forget, where we did a VFIO special episode, I ran into

20:05.760 --> 20:13.000
a bug this weekend where on kernel 5.2.1, there is a K-mode exception not handled bug

20:13.000 --> 20:19.400
and this manifests itself in your probably Windows guest as random blue screens of death

20:19.400 --> 20:25.520
or 3D apps might randomly crash, so you might be browsing a website using Chrome and it

20:25.520 --> 20:29.200
will just keep crashing time after time after time.

20:29.200 --> 20:34.980
Now this weekend I'd installed a new SSD, so I thought it was that for the longest time,

20:34.980 --> 20:38.560
it wasted the best part of my Saturday trying to fix this.

20:38.560 --> 20:41.960
Wait, so you hit this bug at the same time you did a hardware upgrade?

20:41.960 --> 20:47.760
Yeah, well when I rebooted my machine, it rebooted into kernel 5.2 and I hadn't noticed

20:47.760 --> 20:50.000
that that had also changed, so yeah, perfect storm.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.640
Ah man, that is a nice rite of passage though, that has definitely hit all of us, that's

20:53.640 --> 20:54.640
nice.

20:54.640 --> 20:57.440
Yeah, idiot tax.

20:57.440 --> 21:02.240
It's a really simple fix, just downgrade your kernel to something that is older than 5,

21:02.240 --> 21:07.680
so for the moment I've gone back in the AUR, I've gone back to Linux VFIO LTS, which is

21:07.680 --> 21:13.840
just an AUR package, which takes me back to 4.19, I don't necessarily think I need anything

21:13.840 --> 21:18.440
in 5.x for a while, so we'll find out soon enough.

21:18.440 --> 21:19.840
Is this going to impact me on Fedora?

21:19.840 --> 21:22.600
I'm on 30 right now, but I think I'm on kernel 5.1.

21:22.600 --> 21:24.600
Yeah, it could do.

21:24.600 --> 21:27.320
Hmm, uh oh, crap.

21:27.320 --> 21:32.240
There's another bug in kernel 5.2 that you might bump into as well, and there's a regression

21:32.240 --> 21:39.280
in the way file systems are mounted that can cause some file systems to get deadlocked

21:39.280 --> 21:40.280
when they mount.

21:40.280 --> 21:42.160
Oh, that sounds like tons of fun.

21:42.160 --> 21:43.160
Lovely.

21:43.160 --> 21:45.520
No, actually, not tons of fun.

21:45.520 --> 21:47.000
Dang it.

21:47.000 --> 21:51.880
All right, so everybody hold out for kernel 5.4.

21:51.880 --> 22:01.440
On an up note, while I've been playing around with these ultra-mobile PCs, I backed a crowdfunder

22:01.440 --> 22:03.840
for what's called a Topjoy Falcon.

22:03.840 --> 22:04.840
Really?

22:04.840 --> 22:05.840
Tell me about this.

22:05.840 --> 22:11.800
Well, that's an 8-inch netbook style.

22:11.800 --> 22:17.080
These days they're called UMPCs, but we know them as netbooks from a decade ago.

22:17.080 --> 22:20.980
And this one's a little bit bigger than the other ones I've got.

22:20.980 --> 22:30.440
So the keyboard is decent, and it's in a aluminum unibody design, and it has an optical touch

22:30.440 --> 22:32.960
point and a touch screen.

22:32.960 --> 22:37.600
And because of the work I've done on other devices like this, when I had a look at the

22:37.600 --> 22:42.880
hardware enumeration, I was like, aha, this is the track point that I've dealt with in

22:42.880 --> 22:48.520
the GPD Pocket 2, and this is the touch screen and the display device I've dealt with in

22:48.520 --> 22:50.400
the GPD Pocket 1.

22:50.400 --> 22:55.080
So by looking at the other devices I've worked on before, I was able to enable that device

22:55.080 --> 22:58.120
with a bespoke image in a couple of hours.

22:58.120 --> 23:06.320
So images for Ubuntu MATE 1804 and 1904 are on the website, and backers of that crowdfunder

23:06.320 --> 23:08.520
are just receiving their devices at the moment.

23:08.520 --> 23:13.920
So at the point at which new devices are available, there is also a Linux operating system all

23:13.920 --> 23:16.720
pre-configured ready for you to install.

23:16.720 --> 23:17.720
Well done, sir.

23:17.720 --> 23:19.760
Well, well done.

23:19.760 --> 23:20.760
Very nice.

23:20.760 --> 23:25.480
And that relationship with GPD is developing now, and I've got two other devices in the

23:25.480 --> 23:27.200
post on their way to me at the moment.

23:27.200 --> 23:32.080
So engineering samples of upcoming devices that I'm looking forward to be working on.

23:32.080 --> 23:36.800
There seems to be clear interest in Ubuntu MATE on these devices, huh?

23:36.800 --> 23:42.840
Well GPD have kind of, because I put the effort in, we've kind of become the de facto Linux

23:42.840 --> 23:44.920
that they speak to me.

23:44.920 --> 23:48.920
We're an email contact, and I'm connected with their engineers, so I know what's going

23:48.920 --> 23:52.180
on with their device engineering.

23:52.180 --> 23:56.640
But that was because I put the effort in and some of the other community projects, because

23:56.640 --> 24:04.560
my work is just derived from the work of others who did community images for the original

24:04.560 --> 24:10.320
GPD Pocket, and that was really the device that kicked this whole movement off again.

24:10.320 --> 24:16.080
So I'm not really creating anything new, but I am actually sustaining the effort because

24:16.080 --> 24:19.180
some of those other projects have fallen by the wayside.

24:19.180 --> 24:24.560
So it's nice for me because all I want in return for a bit of effort is an engineering

24:24.560 --> 24:25.560
sample of the device.

24:25.560 --> 24:28.960
So I've now got five or six of these things in the house, and they're all quite good fun

24:28.960 --> 24:29.960
to play with.

24:29.960 --> 24:33.140
And that is an important part of the open source ecosystem too, is making sure some

24:33.140 --> 24:34.800
of that stuff continues on.

24:34.800 --> 24:36.840
Well, that's great.

24:36.840 --> 24:39.800
So Wimpy, you joined us a bit in progress.

24:39.800 --> 24:41.880
Thomas, this is Martin Wimpress.

24:41.880 --> 24:46.240
He's an employee at Canonical and he's the lead for Ubuntu Mate.

24:46.240 --> 24:52.600
Wimpy Thomas works at Amazon in their Linux area amongst a long history of things, but

24:52.600 --> 24:54.800
he's currently in the Amazon Linux team.

24:54.800 --> 24:55.800
Pleasure to meet you.

24:55.800 --> 24:56.800
And you.

24:56.800 --> 25:00.440
And I very much enjoyed your talk at Texas Linux Fest.

25:00.440 --> 25:01.440
Thank you very much.

25:01.440 --> 25:02.440
I appreciate it.

25:02.440 --> 25:03.440
So it's great.

25:03.440 --> 25:04.440
It's great.

25:04.440 --> 25:05.440
I just feel like it's been forever.

25:05.440 --> 25:06.440
So Wimpy, it's great to have you here.

25:06.440 --> 25:07.440
Sure is.

25:07.440 --> 25:08.440
Everybody, go listen to the Ubuntu podcast.

25:08.440 --> 25:11.080
Like if you've been listening to the show and you're like, I miss Wimpy and Popey.

25:11.080 --> 25:14.440
Well, actually, Popey hasn't been on the Ubuntu podcast for a couple of weeks, but Laura has

25:14.440 --> 25:15.440
been back.

25:15.440 --> 25:16.440
So go check it out.

25:16.440 --> 25:17.440
It's a good show.

25:17.440 --> 25:18.440
Okay.

25:18.440 --> 25:21.920
Just a couple of other community news items before we wrap up.

25:21.920 --> 25:28.200
Alex, you have some good news and it's regarding one of your projects that we don't talk about

25:28.200 --> 25:31.040
too often, but we probably should, which is Linux Server IO.

25:31.040 --> 25:32.040
I love it.

25:32.040 --> 25:34.760
I use many of your containers here at Jupyter Broadcasting.

25:34.760 --> 25:35.760
We all do.

25:35.760 --> 25:42.120
And the Linux Server IO group has joined Open Collective, which Alex, if my understanding

25:42.120 --> 25:46.920
is correct, and correct me if I'm wrong, it's like Patreon, but for infrastructure projects.

25:46.920 --> 25:48.520
That's a little more open.

25:48.520 --> 25:49.720
Yeah, that's right.

25:49.720 --> 25:54.800
We've been searching for a long time for a sane way to deal with donations, given that

25:54.800 --> 25:58.040
we have team members located across the globe.

25:58.040 --> 26:03.880
We looked at registering as a charity in England and as a charitable organization here in Australia

26:03.880 --> 26:05.960
and all sorts of places.

26:05.960 --> 26:10.920
To be honest, we were getting bogged down in red tape everywhere we turned and Open

26:10.920 --> 26:17.160
Collective allows us to take donations via a Patreon type model and it allows people

26:17.160 --> 26:21.280
who want to donate to give us as much or as little as they want in a recurring monthly

26:21.280 --> 26:26.160
fashion if they would like to, but most importantly for us, it's a very low overhead to manage.

26:26.160 --> 26:28.200
They handle all the taxes and everything else.

26:28.200 --> 26:32.560
So yeah, it just means the project is going to be a lot more sustainable moving forward.

26:32.560 --> 26:39.240
Why Open Collective and I'm asking in like the sort of will other open source infrastructure

26:39.240 --> 26:41.360
projects maybe choose something like this?

26:41.360 --> 26:45.960
What was it about Open Collective versus Patreon or, you know, setting up your own white label

26:45.960 --> 26:47.720
subscriber payment system?

26:47.720 --> 26:49.800
They are open source themselves.

26:49.800 --> 26:54.040
So if you see something as part of their platform that you don't like, you can improve it.

26:54.040 --> 26:55.480
Oh, very good.

26:55.480 --> 26:59.960
Well, we will have a link in the show notes if you'd like to support Linux over IO.

26:59.960 --> 27:02.340
Take a look at some of the stuff they've put together.

27:02.340 --> 27:07.920
It has made automating tasks here at Jupiter broadcasting a breeze, but not only that,

27:07.920 --> 27:11.320
one of the more fun projects I've probably worked on in the last six months.

27:11.320 --> 27:18.520
It's been really enjoyable and it's one of those things where like there's complicated

27:18.520 --> 27:19.820
topics that you need to learn.

27:19.820 --> 27:23.380
Maybe it's containers or whatever it might be.

27:23.380 --> 27:24.860
It's a great way.

27:24.860 --> 27:26.360
It's a great way to learn those things.

27:26.360 --> 27:29.280
It's a nice, safe, easy to replicate environment.

27:29.280 --> 27:34.840
For those that don't know, we make and ship a bunch of community software packaged in

27:34.840 --> 27:35.840
Docker containers.

27:35.840 --> 27:36.840
Yeah.

27:36.840 --> 27:42.320
Now, a couple of months ago, we covered that Antegros was shutting down and that Endeavor

27:42.320 --> 27:46.840
OS was a community project that was launching to sort of fill that gap.

27:46.840 --> 27:52.280
I was kind of skeptical as a diehard Antegros user.

27:52.280 --> 27:58.760
I didn't want to see a project that I loved have something iterative taken and then sort

27:58.760 --> 28:01.200
of be not as good.

28:01.200 --> 28:07.080
However, I gave it a go this last weekend because they had their first release.

28:07.080 --> 28:11.280
I felt I got to give it a fair shot.

28:11.280 --> 28:17.000
The role here is like a sort of minimal, nice, gooey pre-setup on top of Arch and a little

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
bit more?

28:18.000 --> 28:19.120
Is that what we're aiming for?

28:19.120 --> 28:25.580
But unlike Antegros, it's a slightly modified installer and there's only one desktop, Wes.

28:25.580 --> 28:28.400
There's only one desktop and it's an interesting choice.

28:28.400 --> 28:31.840
It is because it's focused, right?

28:31.840 --> 28:32.840
I gave it a go.

28:32.840 --> 28:35.000
I was very surprised.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.960
I'll talk about that in a moment.

28:36.960 --> 28:44.720
However, I happen to know the editor for Choose Linux and I happen to have some sway there.

28:44.720 --> 28:50.640
So I got a clip from Choose Linux, which will come out, I think, tomorrow, but it's very

28:50.640 --> 28:51.640
soon.

28:51.640 --> 28:56.320
It's chooselinux.show, it's going to be, I think, episode 14.

28:56.320 --> 28:58.480
So chooselinux.show slash 14.

28:58.480 --> 29:02.680
But they're going to do a full review and I got a little clip.

29:02.680 --> 29:07.080
It wasn't long ago, I think it was maybe a month or so ago, Antegos announced that they

29:07.080 --> 29:13.280
were shutting down and Antegos is the easy way to install Arch, essentially, with some

29:13.280 --> 29:15.720
value add as well, to be fair.

29:15.720 --> 29:20.400
And around the time of the announcement, shortly afterwards, a group of people said, hey, we

29:20.400 --> 29:24.480
want to continue it and we're going to call it Endeavor OS.

29:24.480 --> 29:25.480
And I was skeptical.

29:25.480 --> 29:27.800
I didn't know that it was going to actually happen.

29:27.800 --> 29:30.080
But about a week ago, they released their first stable release.

29:30.080 --> 29:34.240
So I thought we'd better check that out, especially as it's got XFCE.

29:34.240 --> 29:36.520
And I must say, I was quite impressed with it.

29:36.520 --> 29:38.120
But Elle, you had some problems, right?

29:38.120 --> 29:43.600
Okay, so I will just be straight, honest and say I have never used Arch before.

29:43.600 --> 29:48.480
So I was going into trying this completely new and I always say it's okay to be new.

29:48.480 --> 29:51.440
So I thought, why not just jump in?

29:51.440 --> 29:52.720
Don't do it in a VM.

29:52.720 --> 29:54.480
Don't do it on a backup machine.

29:54.480 --> 29:56.600
Just kick to it and use it.

29:56.600 --> 30:00.760
Now, I'll tell you what surprises me about that distro hopper segment is we came up with

30:00.760 --> 30:02.040
that as kind of a joke.

30:02.040 --> 30:06.400
I thought initially I might do it on YouTube and then I would just do a screencap with

30:06.400 --> 30:09.320
voiceover and that's how I would do video again.

30:09.320 --> 30:12.540
And then we were kind of joking like, well, what if you guys just hit like a random button

30:12.540 --> 30:14.480
and tried out distros?

30:14.480 --> 30:16.840
And I didn't, you know, like, you know, Joe, right?

30:16.840 --> 30:19.760
I mean, oh, yeah, everybody loves Joe.

30:19.760 --> 30:20.760
That's a fact.

30:20.760 --> 30:21.760
Yeah.

30:21.760 --> 30:24.800
Joe's, Joe's not a big change guy.

30:24.800 --> 30:25.860
He's not a big change guy.

30:25.860 --> 30:29.880
So when, when, when we said to Joe, Hey, what about like, just like hitting a random button

30:29.880 --> 30:32.280
and picking a distro and then having to review it?

30:32.280 --> 30:34.640
I didn't think that was going to work.

30:34.640 --> 30:35.720
Turns out it's been pretty great.

30:35.720 --> 30:38.400
So they have this distro hopper segment where not only are they randomly picking distros

30:38.400 --> 30:42.080
that happens in the show, but they're also doing some intentional reviews, some deep

30:42.080 --> 30:43.080
dives.

30:43.080 --> 30:44.080
It's been really good.

30:44.080 --> 30:47.080
So Drew and Ella are on that show with Joe choose Linux dot show.

30:47.080 --> 30:49.580
I like this distro hopper segment.

30:49.580 --> 30:50.580
It's fun, isn't it?

30:50.580 --> 30:55.840
Yeah, but one of the things I used to love about Linux Luddites, which is the podcast

30:55.840 --> 31:03.660
that Joe created when he first made his foray into Linux podcasting about five years ago,

31:03.660 --> 31:08.480
one of their segments was, I think it was called over a pint and they did the same sort

31:08.480 --> 31:09.480
of thing.

31:09.480 --> 31:13.640
They would pick a distro at random and then the following episode, they would sort of

31:13.640 --> 31:17.880
give their first impressions and I used to love that segment because at the time I was

31:17.880 --> 31:23.920
bootstrapping Ubuntu Marte and I would get all of these little insights about what was

31:23.920 --> 31:28.920
good or bad about all of these other distributions and it was really great research material

31:28.920 --> 31:31.880
that I didn't have to go off and research for myself.

31:31.880 --> 31:36.120
So I'm glad to sort of see the return of that segment.

31:36.120 --> 31:37.120
I really enjoy it.

31:37.120 --> 31:38.120
Well said.

31:38.120 --> 31:40.780
And the thing that I find super fun about it is you've got a bunch of different perspectives.

31:40.780 --> 31:43.860
So Elle comes from a very new to the desktop perspective.

31:43.860 --> 31:47.040
She comes from a server side trying the desktop for the first time.

31:47.040 --> 31:49.400
Drew comes at it from a very curious standpoint.

31:49.400 --> 31:51.440
He's really just curious about everything.

31:51.440 --> 31:55.240
And Joe comes at it from like a well-seasoned, I've been running the desktop for a decade.

31:55.240 --> 31:56.240
Well-seasoned, I like that.

31:56.240 --> 31:57.240
That's a good term.

31:57.240 --> 31:59.920
Yeah, let me tell you how it really is kind of attitude.

31:59.920 --> 32:05.240
And the three of them combined to make a really solid analysis about a distro or a desktop

32:05.240 --> 32:09.200
and they managed to pack it all into like 30 minutes.

32:09.200 --> 32:10.480
It's been really cool.

32:10.480 --> 32:13.640
So anyways, I walked away from Endeavor OS.

32:13.640 --> 32:20.440
My short review, my quick little walk away thing would be they did something new.

32:20.440 --> 32:22.720
Early days, but it's not derivative.

32:22.720 --> 32:24.560
It truly felt like something new.

32:24.560 --> 32:26.980
What have they done that's new exactly?

32:26.980 --> 32:29.620
First of all, it's not just a straight rip off of Anterochros.

32:29.620 --> 32:33.240
It's a slightly modified installer.

32:33.240 --> 32:35.760
Some progress has been made on the installer.

32:35.760 --> 32:42.200
And then it's a fully custom single desktop where they've made some choices about the

32:42.200 --> 32:46.440
applications that are different than the choices the Anterochros folks made.

32:46.440 --> 32:49.360
The desktop environment is based on XFCE.

32:49.360 --> 32:55.560
They've switched out VLC for, oh, I'm blanking on it, but it's sort of an XFCE focused Gstreamer

32:55.560 --> 32:56.560
front end.

32:56.560 --> 32:57.560
Parole.

32:57.560 --> 32:58.560
I think that's it.

32:58.560 --> 32:59.560
Yeah, I think that's it.

32:59.560 --> 33:04.400
So they've made some swaps there and it feels like a unique product.

33:04.400 --> 33:07.480
It doesn't feel like Anterochros next release.

33:07.480 --> 33:08.480
You know what I mean?

33:08.480 --> 33:13.880
Okay, so it's not really the continuation of Anterochros, then it is a different project

33:13.880 --> 33:15.560
with a different agenda.

33:15.560 --> 33:16.640
That's my sense.

33:16.640 --> 33:20.680
They cover it more in Choose Linux, but there will be other desktop options and other install

33:20.680 --> 33:22.800
options that are in the works.

33:22.800 --> 33:23.800
But so that's coming.

33:23.800 --> 33:28.040
Okay, that I was going to say, because that was kind of the thing with Anterochros, right?

33:28.040 --> 33:30.880
I think Anterochros had a different name to start with.

33:30.880 --> 33:37.360
It was Sinarch originally and it was just Cinnamon on Arch and that was the only desktop

33:37.360 --> 33:42.080
option and then it got renamed and then they added all of the different desktop options

33:42.080 --> 33:43.280
to the installer.

33:43.280 --> 33:45.280
History is repeating itself.

33:45.280 --> 33:47.520
It sort of is, but it does make sense.

33:47.520 --> 33:49.880
You know, you do want to focus a bit initially.

33:49.880 --> 33:51.360
You want to limit your problem domain.

33:51.360 --> 33:52.360
Get it right.

33:52.360 --> 33:57.640
Yeah, if it were me, I would advise you pick your desktop environment and you stick to

33:57.640 --> 34:02.760
that one desktop environment and you just execute really well on that one thing.

34:02.760 --> 34:08.200
As soon as you become a Linux Mint where you're looking at two different distribution bases

34:08.200 --> 34:14.280
and four different desktops, you're spreading yourself too thin and you can be good at everything

34:14.280 --> 34:15.920
but not great at anything.

34:15.920 --> 34:24.880
I do think my future need a quick Arch install, just want to try something out on Arch, Go

34:24.880 --> 34:26.800
To Distro will be Endeavor OS.

34:26.800 --> 34:27.800
Is that right?

34:27.800 --> 34:28.800
Okay.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.920
Because that was honestly, that was probably the thing I used Anterochros the most for

34:30.920 --> 34:31.920
as well.

34:31.920 --> 34:37.720
Why Endeavor and not Manjaro, given at the moment that Manjaro's default desktop environment

34:37.720 --> 34:42.160
is also XFCE and they've been doing this a lot longer, so I'm guessing there's probably

34:42.160 --> 34:43.520
more refinement there.

34:43.520 --> 34:44.520
I agree.

34:44.520 --> 34:48.000
I think if you wanted a full desktop that you were going to use long term at this point,

34:48.000 --> 34:51.800
it would probably be Manjaro if you wanted something that was Arch based and didn't want

34:51.800 --> 34:52.800
to use Arch.

34:52.800 --> 34:53.800
Chris likes the shiny mountain.

34:53.800 --> 34:54.800
That's what it is.

34:54.800 --> 34:55.800
I know that.

34:55.800 --> 34:59.600
I'm just kind of being devil's advocate because we've got a new distro on the block.

34:59.600 --> 35:06.440
There's some heritage or a reason for its being, which is the discontinuation of Antergos.

35:06.440 --> 35:10.840
And then there's some real similarities with Manjaro, which is also an Arch derivative.

35:10.840 --> 35:19.080
So what Antergos gave me that Manjaro doesn't really satisfy is damn near vanilla Arch.

35:19.080 --> 35:21.920
And I would say Endeavor OS is even slightly closer.

35:21.920 --> 35:22.920
I could be wrong.

35:22.920 --> 35:28.000
I didn't do a scientific calculation, but by the quick count that I did, six packages

35:28.000 --> 35:30.840
came from their own repo.

35:30.840 --> 35:37.720
And two of them were their GPG key package and things like that to make the repo possible.

35:37.720 --> 35:43.040
So it's very mild modifications from upstream Arch.

35:43.040 --> 35:48.000
It would take you 20 minutes at most to just make it an upstream Arch box.

35:48.000 --> 35:52.760
And that's what I'm looking for is I'm looking for a shortcut to just get a full graphical

35:52.760 --> 35:57.040
desktop environment with a web browser and a media player and some codecs.

35:57.040 --> 35:58.360
A bootstrap.

35:58.360 --> 35:59.360
Yeah.

35:59.360 --> 36:00.480
On top of Arch.

36:00.480 --> 36:05.080
Because if I'm installing Arch these days, it's because I need Arch to do a task.

36:05.080 --> 36:09.400
I'm not necessarily installing it to use for six months to five years.

36:09.400 --> 36:13.620
And if I was, maybe I would consider Manjaro at this point.

36:13.620 --> 36:17.720
But for me, right now, I'm sticking to Fedora and Ubuntu for the desktop.

36:17.720 --> 36:20.200
But that does seem like a good Arch candidate.

36:20.200 --> 36:24.100
And I think I'm going to check back in and maybe every other release or so.

36:24.100 --> 36:27.400
It's looking pretty good, and I got to say, I love Pac-Man.

36:27.400 --> 36:28.400
I know, right?

36:28.400 --> 36:29.600
It's always a dream.

36:29.600 --> 36:34.320
Not just Pac-Man, but the AUR, that sauce is really hard to get rid of once you've tasted

36:34.320 --> 36:35.320
it.

36:35.320 --> 36:38.760
Thankfully, there's this project called Linux over IO that makes software much more available

36:38.760 --> 36:40.480
on just about any distribution I choose.

36:40.480 --> 36:42.600
So I haven't had that problem for a while.

36:42.600 --> 36:43.600
All right.

36:43.600 --> 36:44.600
Well, let's move on now.

36:44.600 --> 36:46.640
We have a few things to get into.

36:46.640 --> 36:50.020
Number one is the housekeeping.

36:50.020 --> 36:51.700
Just a really quick one here.

36:51.700 --> 36:53.680
This is kind of a great study group that's kicking off.

36:53.680 --> 36:57.360
It's like the next generation of the study groups we've been doing for a while.

36:57.360 --> 37:01.520
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting for times, dates and information highlights.

37:01.520 --> 37:05.760
It's passing the AWS Cloud Practitioner Exam.

37:05.760 --> 37:10.280
This is a free online study group that we're getting more people at Linux Academy involved

37:10.280 --> 37:11.280
in to give.

37:11.280 --> 37:13.200
It's actually training away for free.

37:13.200 --> 37:15.200
I don't know.

37:15.200 --> 37:16.200
What's the downside here?

37:16.200 --> 37:20.640
Just take advantage of a lot of us do this and learn some things.

37:20.640 --> 37:21.640
How long will you let us do this?

37:21.640 --> 37:22.640
They can't take it away again.

37:22.640 --> 37:23.640
So you're set.

37:23.640 --> 37:25.540
Once it's on the internet, it's out there.

37:25.540 --> 37:30.800
But if you want to ask questions or get information, meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

37:30.800 --> 37:33.520
Once you set Elle on a task, man, she is like-

37:33.520 --> 37:34.520
Watch out.

37:34.520 --> 37:35.520
I know.

37:35.520 --> 37:36.520
She's going to get it done.

37:36.520 --> 37:37.520
She's just taking this to the whole next level.

37:37.520 --> 37:38.560
They're going to get even better.

37:38.560 --> 37:41.160
So meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting for that and more.

37:41.160 --> 37:47.360
Speaking of AWS, by the way, Elle has also released a whole bunch of more AWS content

37:47.360 --> 37:49.960
for free as well as additional courses.

37:49.960 --> 37:52.040
We'll have a link to that in the show notes.

37:52.040 --> 37:53.320
That's something that she and I do now.

37:53.320 --> 37:56.400
They should never have given her the key because it's all the best stuff.

37:56.400 --> 37:57.400
I know.

37:57.400 --> 37:58.720
Elle asked me, she's like, what do you think about this, this and that?

37:58.720 --> 38:03.200
I'm like, well, Elle, just use your best and just do whatever you want.

38:03.200 --> 38:04.200
You're going to do it, right?

38:04.200 --> 38:05.200
Just do it.

38:05.200 --> 38:06.200
And it hasn't gone wrong yet.

38:06.200 --> 38:07.200
So check that out.

38:07.200 --> 38:14.880
We have links to all that stuff in the show notes as well as a link to the Friday stream.

38:14.880 --> 38:18.800
May there only be a limited number of Friday streams left?

38:18.800 --> 38:23.960
Could there be a very special Friday stream where the entire crew is in studio?

38:23.960 --> 38:26.160
All of these questions and more will be answered.

38:26.160 --> 38:27.320
I've got to know.

38:27.320 --> 38:28.960
At fridaystream.com.

38:28.960 --> 38:34.360
The latest episode, fridaystream.com slash 10, Young and the Reckless, was our first

38:34.360 --> 38:37.640
stories about the ways we trashed our early vehicles.

38:37.640 --> 38:39.680
Really, that's what it came down to.

38:39.680 --> 38:44.240
You know, I was on a trip when I was listening to the Friday stream live, of course, because

38:44.240 --> 38:46.600
that's the way to do it if you can.

38:46.600 --> 38:50.320
I saw both of my first cars, the first one I wrecked and then the second second car I

38:50.320 --> 38:51.320
used after that.

38:51.320 --> 38:53.020
So it's a great episode.

38:53.020 --> 38:54.020
Did you hear about that?

38:54.020 --> 38:55.020
Did you hear my transmission story?

38:55.020 --> 38:56.020
Oh, man.

38:56.020 --> 38:57.020
I know.

38:57.020 --> 38:58.020
I know.

38:58.020 --> 38:59.020
I know.

38:59.020 --> 39:00.020
That was crazy.

39:00.020 --> 39:01.020
Anyways, the Friday stream is great.

39:01.020 --> 39:02.020
It may it may be a limited product.

39:02.020 --> 39:03.020
I don't know.

39:03.020 --> 39:04.020
Who knows?

39:04.020 --> 39:05.020
People don't know.

39:05.020 --> 39:08.040
If somebody may know, but who could that be?

39:08.040 --> 39:09.040
Who could that be?

39:09.040 --> 39:13.040
Check it out fridaystream.com and there's much more.

39:13.040 --> 39:17.280
We have links in the show notes for everything I've been yammering on about, including all

39:17.280 --> 39:21.920
of the news stories and everything else we're about to talk about at linuxunplug.com slash

39:21.920 --> 39:22.920
311.

39:22.920 --> 39:29.120
All right, Thomas, thank you for waiting through all that.

39:29.120 --> 39:30.120
Appreciate it.

39:30.120 --> 39:31.120
Of course.

39:31.120 --> 39:37.080
So, Thomas, I guess you're not new to the Texas Linux Fest scene or that whole Linux

39:37.080 --> 39:41.720
scene at all since you've been in the biz since about 1993, if I recall, correct?

39:41.720 --> 39:42.720
Correct.

39:42.720 --> 39:48.380
I've presented at Texas Linux Fest numerous times over the years.

39:48.380 --> 39:51.240
My daughters have volunteered with TXLF.

39:51.240 --> 39:57.240
So yeah, I've spent a lot of time with and absolutely love the folks who organize Texas

39:57.240 --> 39:58.240
Linux Fest.

39:58.240 --> 40:02.320
I think one of the things that really resonated about your talk is that you and I have had

40:02.320 --> 40:05.520
a very similar timeline in IT.

40:05.520 --> 40:14.000
You started a bit before I did because when I started, Turbo Linux was no longer a thing.

40:14.000 --> 40:20.300
It was like it was on the decline, but when you started, you became Turbo Linux certified

40:20.300 --> 40:23.300
instructor number 001.

40:23.300 --> 40:27.220
I don't even know if many people listening have even heard of Turbo Linux before.

40:27.220 --> 40:31.480
It's really big in Japan.

40:31.480 --> 40:35.560
And actually, this is one of the few times where I can say that with a perfectly straight

40:35.560 --> 40:36.560
face.

40:36.560 --> 40:39.480
Turbo Linux actually has done very well in APAC.

40:39.480 --> 40:45.480
But yeah, back in the day, Turbo Linux was one of numerous distros out there.

40:45.480 --> 40:50.820
And at the time, I owned a small IT consultancy and we got engaged because I had written a

40:50.820 --> 40:54.600
whole bunch of Red Hat Linux training courses.

40:54.600 --> 40:59.500
And we got engaged by Turbo Linux to develop a Turbo Linux certification course.

40:59.500 --> 41:04.480
This next question is in the context of the overall direction of the jobs market.

41:04.480 --> 41:09.280
I'm curious, how did you go from 14 years at Red Hat to...

41:09.280 --> 41:12.360
Which when I think of Red Hat, especially the time you were at Red Hat, I think very

41:12.360 --> 41:15.360
much of on-premises installations and things like that.

41:15.360 --> 41:23.520
How did you go from that career trajectory for 14 years into Amazon, which to me is...

41:23.520 --> 41:27.040
It seems like a pretty big pivot for somebody in your career trajectory.

41:27.040 --> 41:32.680
You seem like you're very much on-premises, building on-premises data centers, systems

41:32.680 --> 41:36.040
out, supporting those clients, running an independent contracting company, then you

41:36.040 --> 41:37.040
go work for Red Hat.

41:37.040 --> 41:40.760
It sort of extends that career trajectory, then all of a sudden you get to Amazon and

41:40.760 --> 41:42.720
it seems like a bit of a 180 to me.

41:42.720 --> 41:45.000
Well, I don't think it's a 180.

41:45.000 --> 41:49.240
I think that it's a pretty natural progression, honestly.

41:49.240 --> 41:52.600
Because look at the evolution of cloud, right?

41:52.600 --> 41:57.800
For a long time, people were saying it's cloud when it was really just virtualized hosting.

41:57.800 --> 42:02.080
Yeah, you're on-premises set up, but up on somebody else's infrastructure.

42:02.080 --> 42:08.240
Lift and shift, we'll do your mess for less kind of things.

42:08.240 --> 42:12.180
I spent a fair amount of time helping customers do things like that.

42:12.180 --> 42:18.460
But then as cloud native applications and application services started taking off and

42:18.460 --> 42:25.840
as storage changed and as networking sort of evolved and became more complex in cloud

42:25.840 --> 42:30.680
computing environments, at their core, all of the services that you see most of the cloud

42:30.680 --> 42:36.560
providers out there offering are built on Linux.

42:36.560 --> 42:37.560
For me, it wasn't a 180.

42:37.560 --> 42:39.160
It was a fairly natural progression.

42:39.160 --> 42:49.680
It was realizing that everybody seems to be taking a cloud first attitude or strategy.

42:49.680 --> 42:55.320
And a lot of these organizations, a lot of big enterprises are taking a containerized

42:55.320 --> 43:01.600
first in the cloud and not even your mess for less, dump what we're doing out into the

43:01.600 --> 43:02.600
cloud.

43:02.600 --> 43:06.960
But let's really, really architect our applications to take advantage of cloud native services,

43:06.960 --> 43:09.100
which are all based on Linux.

43:09.100 --> 43:11.760
So that's what I decided to chase.

43:11.760 --> 43:12.960
Makes sense to me.

43:12.960 --> 43:17.560
The thing you said in the keynote that, well, you really demonstrated it actually with job

43:17.560 --> 43:18.560
searches.

43:18.560 --> 43:23.080
But essentially the punchline is the Linux sysadmin could be going the way of the Unix

43:23.080 --> 43:24.080
sysadmin.

43:24.080 --> 43:28.000
Not that it's going to be obliterated completely, but it's going to become a niche.

43:28.000 --> 43:31.560
And when you do a job search in a popular area, you're down in the Austin area right

43:31.560 --> 43:32.560
now.

43:32.560 --> 43:36.700
You do a job search down there for a Linux admin, you get X amount of results.

43:36.700 --> 43:41.960
You do a search for cloud architect or cloud engineer and you get almost four or five X,

43:41.960 --> 43:44.320
maybe even more results.

43:44.320 --> 43:46.560
What's at the core of that though is Linux, right?

43:46.560 --> 43:50.000
So it's not that we are left out of this transition.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.720
It's just about maybe adapting to the times.

43:52.720 --> 43:53.720
Yeah, absolutely.

43:53.720 --> 43:58.640
I mean, I think that it's really, really natural, especially if you've been doing this for a

43:58.640 --> 44:03.840
long time to go, well, I know Linux, I know the data center, I know, you know, IP tables

44:03.840 --> 44:08.880
and networking and subnet masking and storage and, you know, I want to do that in the data

44:08.880 --> 44:09.880
center.

44:09.880 --> 44:13.760
It's really easy to get caught up and scared of change.

44:13.760 --> 44:19.160
But when you look at the infrastructure that is running every cloud provider out there,

44:19.160 --> 44:23.400
it's all open source, it's all Linux, it's all things you're already used to.

44:23.400 --> 44:29.000
And so I don't think that folks should look at it as, oh my gosh, this is going to be

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
hard.

44:30.000 --> 44:34.880
They should look at it as, wow, I've already got a head start on a lot of other folks because

44:34.880 --> 44:37.040
I understand the underlying technologies.

44:37.040 --> 44:40.300
Yeah, that is, I think, a very good way to look at it.

44:40.300 --> 44:41.920
And it's the reality of the situation.

44:41.920 --> 44:43.560
You're well positioned.

44:43.560 --> 44:47.520
I want to just take a tangent for a moment and talk about something that we never talk

44:47.520 --> 44:51.200
about on the show, and that's Amazon Linux.

44:51.200 --> 44:57.400
Correct me where I'm wrong, but my understanding is that it is at least initially based on

44:57.400 --> 45:01.920
a version of RHEL, but that's about the extent of my understanding.

45:01.920 --> 45:03.000
Is that correct?

45:03.000 --> 45:08.760
So we have a lot of commonality with, say, CentOS or Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

45:08.760 --> 45:14.080
But what we did when we were developing, especially Amazon Linux 2, which is the latest version

45:14.080 --> 45:20.400
that's out there, is we wanted to have a distro that was familiar and comfortable to enterprise

45:20.400 --> 45:21.400
users.

45:21.400 --> 45:25.020
So yes, it does share a common heritage with Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

45:25.020 --> 45:27.080
It's similar to CentOS.

45:27.080 --> 45:33.160
But we recompiled the GCC tool chain, put a newer version of glibc, newer version of

45:33.160 --> 45:38.500
the kernel, optimized and tuned it for virtualized environments.

45:38.500 --> 45:45.480
So while it is a similar environment and gives you a similar experience to other RPM-based

45:45.480 --> 45:49.560
distros, it is really purpose-built for cloud computing.

45:49.560 --> 45:54.120
So it's not necessarily pegged to a specific version of CentOS or RHEL?

45:54.120 --> 45:55.120
Nope.

45:55.120 --> 45:56.120
Hmm.

45:56.120 --> 46:00.880
And kind of in this context, what are your thoughts on the universal base image that

46:00.880 --> 46:03.440
Red Hat's working on as part of RHEL 8?

46:03.440 --> 46:04.440
Hmm.

46:04.440 --> 46:10.640
So UBI, I saw a lot of the development that went on around UBI when I was still at Red

46:10.640 --> 46:11.640
Hat.

46:11.640 --> 46:13.520
UBI is interesting.

46:13.520 --> 46:16.120
It is designed for containerized environments.

46:16.120 --> 46:18.560
It is designed to be used as a container.

46:18.560 --> 46:20.200
It's not a full distro.

46:20.200 --> 46:22.560
Could run on top of Amazon Linux 2.

46:22.560 --> 46:23.560
Sure.

46:23.560 --> 46:24.560
Absolutely.

46:24.560 --> 46:25.560
Yeah.

46:25.560 --> 46:28.760
So it's free, freely available, zero cost.

46:28.760 --> 46:32.980
They want everyone to adopt UBI for all of their containerized workloads.

46:32.980 --> 46:36.160
And I think that that is a noble cause.

46:36.160 --> 46:42.480
I think that there are a lot of organizations which have done analysis of container runtimes

46:42.480 --> 46:45.420
and found that smaller is better.

46:45.420 --> 46:51.240
And UBI, being a universal base image, tries to be all things to all people.

46:51.240 --> 46:56.480
And so in the environments where you've got to spin up thousands or tens of thousands

46:56.480 --> 47:01.560
of containers, you're probably going to want to look real hard at what the performance

47:01.560 --> 47:03.800
impact is for having a larger container.

47:03.800 --> 47:06.360
That is not a slam or a dig at all.

47:06.360 --> 47:11.720
There are some cases where UBI is absolutely going to make sense, but there are also going

47:11.720 --> 47:12.720
to be cases where it doesn't.

47:12.720 --> 47:13.720
Yeah.

47:13.720 --> 47:15.600
I think that's a fair observation.

47:15.600 --> 47:20.440
And everything you say, I consider your personal opinion, doesn't reflect Amazon or anything

47:20.440 --> 47:21.440
like that.

47:21.440 --> 47:24.500
So this is all just what Thomas thinks.

47:24.500 --> 47:31.160
And in that kind of vein, when I look at Amazon Linux 2 and how it's used at such a fantastic

47:31.160 --> 47:38.040
scale, and I take that out over the next five to 10 years, and I multiply that across Azure

47:38.040 --> 47:45.300
and Google Cloud, and I think not a single one of those is a Red Hat subscription.

47:45.300 --> 47:50.680
And I wonder if this plays a bit into IBM's acquisition or perhaps why Red Hat may have

47:50.680 --> 47:53.600
been willing to sell to IBM.

47:53.600 --> 48:00.260
Again, your personal opinion, but do you think there is a sort of a market momentum that

48:00.260 --> 48:03.680
may have been on their minds during this acquisition?

48:03.680 --> 48:04.680
Wow.

48:04.680 --> 48:09.120
That's a little difficult to answer because I was inside of the organization during the

48:09.120 --> 48:11.080
acquisition process.

48:11.080 --> 48:16.040
I will say that you can look anywhere in the industry.

48:16.040 --> 48:22.320
You can look at AWS, you can look at Azure, you can look at GCE, you can look at the smaller

48:22.320 --> 48:27.160
ones like Rackspace or any one of the organizations out there.

48:27.160 --> 48:31.900
They're all running a whole lot of unpaid Linux.

48:31.900 --> 48:35.360
They're making a whole lot of unpaid Linux available to their customers.

48:35.360 --> 48:40.040
And their customers are all saying, meh, it's good enough.

48:40.040 --> 48:44.960
If you look at the paradigm shift that we're seeing where folks are saying, meh, I'm going

48:44.960 --> 48:52.520
to do things as cattle, not pets, or even not necessarily as cattle, but as containerization

48:52.520 --> 48:56.220
so that if something breaks, if something didn't work, I throw it away, I spin a new

48:56.220 --> 48:57.220
one up.

48:57.220 --> 48:58.220
I don't care.

48:58.220 --> 48:59.600
I don't care about the underlying operating system.

48:59.600 --> 49:06.920
I don't care about the technology in as much as it has to be distro X or distro Y.

49:06.920 --> 49:14.160
So I think that the writing is on the wall for expensive, big distributions.

49:14.160 --> 49:19.360
And I think that everybody recognizes that open source has become commoditized.

49:19.360 --> 49:21.660
Linux has become commoditized.

49:21.660 --> 49:28.280
And so, yeah, I think that that very well may have been one of the driving forces.

49:28.280 --> 49:30.440
That stream, that well is going dry.

49:30.440 --> 49:32.200
Maybe it's time to cash out.

49:32.200 --> 49:33.200
I don't know.

49:33.200 --> 49:34.640
Great point.

49:34.640 --> 49:40.440
And in your talk, you talk about the distro wars as if they're over.

49:40.440 --> 49:42.480
Is this kind of why?

49:42.480 --> 49:46.360
Is this new reality why when you talk about the distro wars in your keynote, you talk

49:46.360 --> 49:51.080
about them in a past tense and you talk about the damage they did, not that they're doing?

49:51.080 --> 49:55.600
I think that there's still some of that mentality because you've always got the fanboys, right?

49:55.600 --> 49:58.680
And to be clear, I was a fanboy for a long time.

49:58.680 --> 50:00.560
I still fanboy a little bit.

50:00.560 --> 50:01.880
There are some distros that I really love.

50:01.880 --> 50:05.480
I love Fedora.

50:05.480 --> 50:09.920
But I think that, yes, when you had in the early days, you had these distros that were

50:09.920 --> 50:16.240
doing fairly different things around the Linux kernel and you couldn't install the same piece

50:16.240 --> 50:20.600
of software across two different distros without totally recompiling.

50:20.600 --> 50:21.600
That was bad.

50:21.600 --> 50:22.600
That was harmful.

50:22.600 --> 50:26.680
It was exactly the same thing that we saw during the Unix wars that, oh, it wouldn't

50:26.680 --> 50:33.040
work on this sysv versus this bsd init style or, you know, hpux had a different kernel

50:33.040 --> 50:36.440
and you had to recompile stuff versus sunOS.

50:36.440 --> 50:42.040
All that craziness, different administration tools, different interfaces.

50:42.040 --> 50:45.280
I think that the distro wars were very harmful.

50:45.280 --> 50:47.240
I don't think we're seeing that as much today.

50:47.240 --> 50:52.680
I think we're seeing a lot more work towards interoperability between distros with things

50:52.680 --> 50:57.120
like Flatpak and so on that I think it's fantastic.

50:57.120 --> 50:58.440
I think it's wonderful, man.

50:58.440 --> 51:03.640
Use the distro that you like and still be able to access the software that you need

51:03.640 --> 51:04.640
to get your job done.

51:04.640 --> 51:06.040
I mean, no doubt about it, right?

51:06.040 --> 51:11.900
I mean, looking back at since 1993 compared to today, it is so much easier to run the

51:11.900 --> 51:13.800
distro that you want to run.

51:13.800 --> 51:14.800
Oh, yeah.

51:14.800 --> 51:17.840
I mean, you remember as well as I do.

51:17.840 --> 51:18.840
And I talked about it.

51:18.840 --> 51:20.800
I alluded to it in the keynote.

51:20.800 --> 51:29.180
Man, you know, I remember fighting for literally about a week to get my first distro installed.

51:29.180 --> 51:32.060
And then I finally got it installed and it booted up and there was a little flashing

51:32.060 --> 51:37.080
login cursor and I was like, ah, what do I do now?

51:37.080 --> 51:42.120
Thomas, when you brought up when you brought up wind modems, I actually felt physical pain.

51:42.120 --> 51:43.840
I felt physical pain.

51:43.840 --> 51:45.640
Oh, God, it was so bad.

51:45.640 --> 51:46.640
Yeah, it was so bad.

51:46.640 --> 51:47.640
It was so bad.

51:47.640 --> 51:52.960
Well, any kind of advice or any kind of quote unquote mentorship that you would give to

51:52.960 --> 51:57.360
somebody who's looking to get into the Linux market today?

51:57.360 --> 52:00.800
What are some of the fundamentals that they probably need to start thinking about to be

52:00.800 --> 52:03.120
successful in the job market?

52:03.120 --> 52:07.340
Not to put you on the spot, but no, no, no, that's that's actually a really good question.

52:07.340 --> 52:13.480
And I will say what you heard me say before, install Linux on your primary machine and

52:13.480 --> 52:18.000
it's going to be scary and you're going to not know how to do stuff and it's going to

52:18.000 --> 52:21.960
freak you out and you're going to be missing, you know, applications in the whatever your

52:21.960 --> 52:26.440
OS of choice is, Windows or Mac OS or whatever, and it's going to suck for the first couple

52:26.440 --> 52:27.440
of weeks.

52:27.440 --> 52:34.300
But if you immerse yourself, if you force yourself to really use it every single day,

52:34.300 --> 52:39.540
learn about how networking works, learn about what subnetting is, understand why you always

52:39.540 --> 52:45.560
have a 192.168 address when you're at home, like just that sort of basic blocking and

52:45.560 --> 52:50.460
tackling getting it up and running, getting users installed, configuring services.

52:50.460 --> 52:57.160
If you do those things and you can speak intelligently about them when you go to interview, you're

52:57.160 --> 53:01.760
going to have a huge leg up over somebody who's just kind of the paper tiger that, you

53:01.760 --> 53:07.120
know, oh, I read a book or I ran through a, you know, some online cheesy CBT that didn't

53:07.120 --> 53:10.000
really make me go through and perform tasks.

53:10.000 --> 53:11.640
Can I just add to that?

53:11.640 --> 53:12.640
Sure.

53:12.640 --> 53:13.640
Absolutely.

53:13.640 --> 53:16.800
So the first thing I was going to say is I was, I listened to your question and the first

53:16.800 --> 53:19.640
thing I thought was really learn networking.

53:19.640 --> 53:24.240
So I'm glad that you hit that point because I think that's super important and you know,

53:24.240 --> 53:27.760
people often think about, oh, I know how to get around, you know, the Linux file system

53:27.760 --> 53:33.000
and install packages and configure packages, but you really need to be an expert at the

53:33.000 --> 53:39.560
network level and then if you want to be an attractive candidate to employers and you

53:39.560 --> 53:44.860
want to be working in the data center, then it doesn't matter which technology you choose

53:44.860 --> 53:49.040
to learn, but learn how to orchestrate Linux at scale.

53:49.040 --> 53:55.440
So it doesn't matter whether it's Puppet or Chef or Ansible or Juju or Maz or whatever,

53:55.440 --> 54:02.120
learn one of those, understand why it's important and understand how you scale Linux horizontally

54:02.120 --> 54:03.120
and vertically.

54:03.120 --> 54:08.520
And if you're able to nail that and networking, you've got a job for life.

54:08.520 --> 54:10.160
I completely agree.

54:10.160 --> 54:11.160
Great tips.

54:11.160 --> 54:17.280
That is one of those things that even today, I still appreciate having some network fundamentals.

54:17.280 --> 54:24.200
Wes and I were on a call on Monday discussing relays and international data transfer and

54:24.200 --> 54:29.040
the hops between and it really, really helps to have a basic understanding.

54:29.040 --> 54:32.000
We live in a distributed world, right, and it's all connected by networks.

54:32.000 --> 54:37.680
I found an incredible value in learning things like Ansible, as Martin just said, but Docker

54:37.680 --> 54:41.580
as well is another life-changing technology for me.

54:41.580 --> 54:45.720
But having a project, a real-world problem that I can solve at home with these things

54:45.720 --> 54:51.440
is that means I can go into an interview and speak authoritatively on a topic and say,

54:51.440 --> 54:56.280
yes, I've done X, Y and Z on my home lab, here's how I can add value to your business.

54:56.280 --> 55:01.560
And just being able to go in there and say those things with some authority is completely

55:01.560 --> 55:02.960
overlooked.

55:02.960 --> 55:07.640
When people are choosing one solution over another, whether it's a Synology NAS versus

55:07.640 --> 55:11.880
building your own thing, that never factors into the equation and I absolutely think it

55:11.880 --> 55:12.880
should for people.

55:12.880 --> 55:13.880
Yeah.

55:13.880 --> 55:15.160
And yeah, you're dead right.

55:15.160 --> 55:20.840
And the number of times that I have messed around with a personal interest project at

55:20.840 --> 55:28.440
home where I've had to learn, let's say, how Ceph works, for example, or ZFS, and then

55:28.440 --> 55:34.380
have been able to use that knowledge and apply it in the workplace, I can't count the number

55:34.380 --> 55:35.640
of times I've done that.

55:35.640 --> 55:41.600
So you know, back to the don't just run it on your desktop PC, it can be something as

55:41.600 --> 55:47.980
simple as a NUC with disks plugged in via USB 3, you know, it doesn't need to be expensive

55:47.980 --> 55:54.240
or fancy, but create yourself a lab that you can bring up and solve problems on.

55:54.240 --> 55:57.800
It's better if they're problems that persist, you know, you like your home media server

55:57.800 --> 56:01.480
or you know, something like that, and really experiment with things, you know, don't be

56:01.480 --> 56:06.480
afraid of experimenting with a new file system paradigm is something that Alex and I were

56:06.480 --> 56:11.440
talking about in the telegram this week, you know, just experiment and use these things.

56:11.440 --> 56:19.160
My daughter and I just bought five of the new Raspberry Pi 4Bs, and you stack those

56:19.160 --> 56:23.440
bad boys up into one of the little, you know, stackable cases.

56:23.440 --> 56:28.700
And all of a sudden, for, you know, a couple hundred bucks, the cost of one NUC that's

56:28.700 --> 56:34.320
not even, you know, super, super built out, you've got multiple machines, so you can do

56:34.320 --> 56:41.560
things like Docker, you can do things like Kubernetes, you know, you can do lab type

56:41.560 --> 56:46.400
of stuff at home for a heck of a lot cheaper than back in the day when we were buying,

56:46.400 --> 56:50.640
you know, old Optiplexes and stuff like that.

56:50.640 --> 56:55.020
And if you don't want to get into, well, it's not so exotic, but if you don't want to get

56:55.020 --> 57:01.120
into the exotic world of ARM, you know, there's even boards like the Atomic Pi, which are

57:01.120 --> 57:05.800
x86 boards, and they're only like 60 bucks, and they're quite pokey, and you can do a

57:05.800 --> 57:06.960
lot with them.

57:06.960 --> 57:11.800
So there's plenty of ways to access sort of cheap hardware to build out your own modest

57:11.800 --> 57:14.760
lab environments to, you know, experiment on.

57:14.760 --> 57:20.380
Top tip from me, if you want to find a good compendium of different CPUs and motherboards

57:20.380 --> 57:25.600
and stuff like that is serverbuild.net, there's some great information on that website.

57:25.600 --> 57:34.280
And I just built this week a PFsense router around $150 with an i5-3470 in it, four gigs

57:34.280 --> 57:35.600
of RAM and all that kind of stuff.

57:35.600 --> 57:41.200
So you know, it is incredible what you can build for that 150 kind of price point these

57:41.200 --> 57:42.200
days.

57:42.200 --> 57:47.120
The Raspberry Pi thing, the reason why that's such a fun tip is it's way more entertaining,

57:47.120 --> 57:49.120
fun and educational than setting up a bunch of VMs.

57:49.120 --> 57:54.460
VMs are a good skill to have too, but it's so cool to physically set up a couple of Pis

57:54.460 --> 57:56.720
and then connect into them and manipulate them.

57:56.720 --> 57:59.920
I like Wimpy's point too, you know, make something you're actually going to rely on because that's

57:59.920 --> 58:02.920
a key part to a lot of this stuff is you're going to have to support it and you're going

58:02.920 --> 58:06.240
to have to figure out what happens when you upgrade and it goes wrong.

58:06.240 --> 58:09.160
And the family can't watch movies on your Plex server anymore.

58:09.160 --> 58:10.160
It's motivating.

58:10.160 --> 58:13.320
Let me put it that way, Wes.

58:13.320 --> 58:18.000
There's nothing like learning how to do RAID recovery if you pull a disk out of your home

58:18.000 --> 58:22.080
server, you know, your Plex on a Saturday morning, you know, just do that and then learn

58:22.080 --> 58:23.720
how to recover that situation.

58:23.720 --> 58:25.820
That'll focus your attention.

58:25.820 --> 58:26.820
Very true.

58:26.820 --> 58:27.820
Very, very true.

58:27.820 --> 58:29.660
I'll throw one more thing out.

58:29.660 --> 58:35.320
When I'm hiring, when I'm looking at a candidate, I will always do a Google search on their

58:35.320 --> 58:36.680
name.

58:36.680 --> 58:41.480
And so I would say that if you are trying to break into the industry, get on mailing

58:41.480 --> 58:48.300
lists, get on, you know, web boards, get on whatever is appropriate for what your interests

58:48.300 --> 58:50.240
are and contribute.

58:50.240 --> 58:55.800
Even if you're not contributing code, I mean, just answer questions or help folks, you know,

58:55.800 --> 58:57.680
help help new folks.

58:57.680 --> 59:01.420
You may not have the answer, but, you know, hey, did you consider blah, blah, blah, blah.

59:01.420 --> 59:06.360
If I, as a hiring manager, see that and see that you're out there trying to do good and

59:06.360 --> 59:11.840
trying to help the community, that gives you massive brownie points in my eyes.

59:11.840 --> 59:12.840
Yeah.

59:12.840 --> 59:15.000
As a hiring manager, I totally endorse that.

59:15.000 --> 59:19.160
That might be one of the single best tips given out on the show, because that is something

59:19.160 --> 59:22.840
that we use when we are researching people that we're talking about on the show.

59:22.840 --> 59:25.920
And that's the way we measure a certain amount of impact, too.

59:25.920 --> 59:28.440
And I can absolutely see how that would correlate to hiring.

59:28.440 --> 59:30.720
I think that is a really good tip.

59:30.720 --> 59:33.720
So, Thomas, I've got two last questions for you.

59:33.720 --> 59:34.720
Sure.

59:34.720 --> 59:35.720
Number one is a long timer.

59:35.720 --> 59:40.320
What are you doing today on your Linux desktop that just just like you if you if you told

59:40.320 --> 59:44.040
10 year if you just went back in time 10 years and told yourself you could do this, it would

59:44.040 --> 59:45.040
blow your mind.

59:45.040 --> 59:46.680
Oh, that's that's easy.

59:46.680 --> 59:50.800
I mean, it's let's ignore containerization because this is sort of, you know, the next

59:50.800 --> 59:51.800
step.

59:51.800 --> 59:58.480
But the fact that I have a machine at my desk with 32 gigs of memory in it, and I can spin

59:58.480 --> 01:00:05.880
up virtual machines in, you know, 10 minutes or not even that two minutes and and set up

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:11.600
complex networked environments, then run Kubernetes on top of it to do my container orchestration.

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:15.560
You know, the fact that I can do all of that on one machine and that one machine, by the

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:19.160
way, has three monitors attached to it 10 years ago.

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:21.600
That was science fiction.

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:24.840
You are making me smile so much right now.

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:28.900
A man after my own heart because I am geeking out so hardcore with PCI pass through and

01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:30.200
virtualization right now.

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:32.840
I can't believe the performance I'm getting.

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:37.740
I'm sitting at a virtual machine with a keyboard, a mouse and a screen, and it feels like I'm

01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:39.220
at bare metal hardware.

01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:41.400
It's just oh, yeah.

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:42.400
Virtualization has come so far.

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.480
It has a future.

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:47.440
That is such a remarkable that is such a remarkable change.

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:48.980
Great, great answer.

01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:55.140
Number two, how would you feel about us doing a once over on your keynote, like doing some

01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:59.280
audio filtering and things like that and releasing it somewhere for people to be able to listen

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:00.280
to?

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:03.280
I don't know if it's ever been public, but I'm just thinking after our talk that would

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:06.560
that keynote would be some really good context for this conversation.

01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:07.560
I'd love to post it somewhere.

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:08.560
How do you feel about that?

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:09.740
I would be honored.

01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:10.880
That would be fantastic.

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:11.880
Thank you so much.

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:12.880
I will figure that out.

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:16.200
I don't know exactly how we'll do that, but we'll do a follow up at some point, and then

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:20.120
I'll let you know whenever we figure it out, because I just came up with that on the spot.

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:23.000
I think it'd be really good, because it was such a great keynote, and you made some great

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.820
points about diversity and different types of diversity, including neurological diversity

01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:30.640
that really resonated with me, and that's in the keynote as well.

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:35.400
We did talk about that in episode 304, so if you do want some additional context before

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:42.160
we get that whole thing posted, go check out linuxunplug.com slash 304 where we have all

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:43.160
that.

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.480
Thomas, we'll have links to your profile and whatnot in our show notes.

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:47.720
Is there anywhere else you want to send people?

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:48.720
AWS.amazon.com.

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:50.680
Got to throw that out there.

01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:51.680
Attaboy.

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:52.680
Good man.

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:53.680
You got to do it.

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:54.680
Yeah, it's great.

01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:55.680
If you've never heard of AWS.

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:56.680
Yeah.

01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:04.520
There's this little company that's doing something to this cloud thing.

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.480
I don't know if it's ever going to be big, but...

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:10.200
I don't know that a book company is ever going to succeed at that.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:11.200
Right.

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:12.200
Yeah.

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:17.360
Let me tell you, the Seattle area could tell you differently.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:22.680
We have some glass balls downtown that say otherwise, big, really big glass balls downtown.

01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:28.080
Man, the first time I saw those, because I flew up for some of my new hire, the first

01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:31.000
time I saw that was like, wow.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.280
It looks like something from Star Trek.

01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:36.040
I bet you there will be a sci-fi episode at some point that films outside those things.

01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:38.440
They're super cool.

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:42.920
If you search the internet right now, you'll find Jeff Bezos thanking the crew for Amazon

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:46.520
Prime Day up on the glass balls.

01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:47.520
It's a pretty great picture.

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:48.960
But that's not in the show notes.

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:49.960
That's something for you to do at home.

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:50.960
But what we...

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:51.960
Bezos balls.

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:57.880
We do have in the show notes is a link to Croc, which is looking to surplant my beloved

01:02:57.880 --> 01:02:58.880
wormhole.

01:02:58.880 --> 01:02:59.880
Did you find this?

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:00.880
Yeah, yeah.

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:03.940
Well, someone found it anyway, and Drew tried it out with me.

01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:05.360
He was good enough.

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:06.360
He agreed.

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:07.360
It's like magic wormholes.

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:08.360
Great.

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:09.960
I think Croc has a slight edge.

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:10.960
It's encrypted.

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:13.840
It lets you send multiple files, and it's resumable.

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:15.120
Okay, hang on.

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:16.120
Rewind.

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:17.120
What's this thing called?

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:18.120
Because I love wormholes.

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:20.600
If there's something better out there, I need to know about this.

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:21.600
Right.

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.600
It's called Croc.

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:23.600
C-R-O-C.

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:24.600
It's on GitHub.

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:25.940
We'll have a link in the show notes.

01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:28.200
And it's all the things we love about wormhole.

01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:33.080
It will do a proxy connection, which you can self-host or that project offers one.

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:38.080
It brings in multiple files and resuming, though, which magic wormhole currently does

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:39.080
not.

01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:40.080
Really quick recap.

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:44.560
For those of you that don't know, these are tools that make it crazy simple to transfer

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:49.520
all kinds of large or small files between machines anywhere in the world.

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:50.800
They will traverse NAT.

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:55.620
They will manage your port 40, aka they don't require it.

01:03:55.620 --> 01:04:00.480
It's a really, really handy way to, say, exchange large working files between groups and not

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:03.080
have to rely on like a cloud service.

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:06.840
Because once the transfer is set up, you're sending directly between machines.

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:11.560
And the thing that Croc's bringing to the party is Windows and Mac support, which is

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:15.000
nice, encryption, multiple files, and resuming.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Yeah.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
And it's just a go binary, too.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.280
So you can just download the tar file.

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:19.280
Oh, quit it.

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:21.880
It's super easy to package up or run wherever you want.

01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:23.400
I really love magic wormhole.

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:24.400
So this does hurt.

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:27.640
Because one of the cool things that it does, and I have not tried Croc, but one of the

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:32.940
things magic wormhole does is you say wormhole send, and then you give it the file name.

01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:37.080
And then it generates a human readable code that's in three segments.

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:38.080
Oh, it is?

01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:39.080
Yep.

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:40.080
That's really nice.

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:44.060
And this magic wormhole, in fairness here, has one of the inspirations for the project.

01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:46.080
So there's a lot of tools here.

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:49.780
And I don't know that it's really necessarily better than what you're doing, unless you

01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:51.320
need one of the features.

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:52.320
Resuming's nice.

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:54.360
Because we're moving like 30 gigs.

01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:56.520
I will certainly take a look at this.

01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:02.000
What I would say is wormhole can transfer multiple files as well.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.280
You just point wormhole at a directory, and then everything in that directory gets transferred.

01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:07.280
Oh, nice.

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:08.280
Fair enough.

01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:09.280
Yes, that is true.

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.280
Oh, look at this.

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:11.280
They have a container ready for it to go.

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:12.840
I also like that the relay's easy to run.

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:14.960
You don't have to run anything separately.

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:17.000
It's another flag to the binary that you have.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.360
So we could put that relay on our own system.

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:20.360
Very easily.

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:21.360
And there's a container for it, yeah.

01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:22.360
Yeah.

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:23.360
Dang it.

01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:24.360
This is happening, isn't it?

01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:25.360
I can already feel this has happened.

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:28.360
Like you and Jeroob decided now it's just time for old man Chris to get on board.

01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:29.360
Dang it.

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:30.360
That's cool.

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:31.520
I love magic wormhole.

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:33.240
I'll still use it with Wimpy.

01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:34.840
Yeah, we're not going to uninstall it.

01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:37.960
No, what's nice about magic wormhole is it's in most repositories.

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:38.960
You just didn't know about it.

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:39.960
That's nice, yes.

01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:40.960
I love those kinds of apps.

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:42.760
They've been in the repo the entire time.

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:43.760
And it's in pip too.

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:45.240
So if you already have Python, you're good to go.

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:46.240
Yeah, of course.

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:47.240
Of course.

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:48.240
All right.

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:50.800
Well, we'll have links to that and more in the show notes.

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:51.800
LinuxUnplugged.com.

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:53.520
Why don't you join us live next week?

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:54.720
Did you know we do this on a Tuesday?

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:56.200
Oh, it's way more fun live.

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:57.200
It is.

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:58.640
Well, there's like more show.

01:05:58.640 --> 01:05:59.640
Extra show.

01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:00.640
Yeah.

01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:02.720
There's a post-show and post-show and the recording, but that's not.

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:03.720
That's just a little teaser.

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:04.720
Spoiler alert.

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:05.720
That's not the whole thing.

01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:06.720
It's not.

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:07.720
It's not the whole thing.

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:09.560
We never really said that, but it's true.

01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:12.080
There's only one way to really find out, though.

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:13.080
jblive.tv.

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:16.800
We have it converted to your local time at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar, as

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:20.640
well as many other fine shows posted over there.

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:25.920
Go check out the links to the guests and as well as the hosts at LinuxUnplugged.com.

01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:27.320
Thanks so much for joining us.

01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:53.880
We'll see you back here next Tuesday.

01:06:57.320 --> 01:07:12.560
Thomas, thank you so much for coming on the show, man.

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:13.560
Absolutely my pleasure.

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:14.560
Thank you for having me.

01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:15.560
That was a lot of fun.

01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:16.560
And thank you for doing the recording too.

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:20.480
So before you stop recording or before you go, we just have one duty left and that is

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:22.280
we must select a title for this episode.

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:23.960
It is the hardest aspect of the show.

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:28.040
So if you go over to jbtitles.com, that's why we make you help us.

01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:29.040
Yeah.

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:31.520
If you go to jbtitles.com, we have a vote.

01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:34.280
Oh, and then we've only gotten seven suggestions.

01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:35.280
Chat room.

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:36.280
Several of them are from me.

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:37.680
Oh my goodness.

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:40.080
So we have only a few choices to pick from.

01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:41.080
Yeah.

01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:42.080
Go help us out.

01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:43.360
I don't think I like any of these.

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:45.120
So we may have to come up with our own.

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:47.680
These I expect more.

01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:52.480
32 hours of outrage.

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:53.940
That is good.

01:07:53.940 --> 01:07:54.940
That is good.

01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:57.520
I got to admit that is really funny.

01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:00.680
I actually would click that too.

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:01.680
It's natural.

01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:02.680
You can't resist.

01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:03.680
Yeah, you can't.

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:04.680
It's instinct.

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:05.880
Can we come up with anything else?

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:06.880
Wimpy, you haven't been here for a while.

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:09.760
I feel like it'd be perfect for you to just have a creative title idea.

01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:11.520
And Brent, where's your game today?

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:12.520
I've just done it.

01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:13.520
What was it?

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:14.520
I've got one in there.

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:15.520
Yeah, Brent.

01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:16.520
We see it.

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:17.520
I mean, it's not like we don't see it, Brent.

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:18.520
I know.

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:19.520
I know.

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:20.520
I never said it was good.

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:22.080
Podcasting in my pants with me.

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:28.440
I don't think that's going to be it.

01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:31.120
I mean, the exclamation point really makes it.

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:35.480
I do appreciate the visual, but imagine all of the audience that has to have that visual,

01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:36.480
Wimpy.

01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:38.440
That's just not something we want to do to them.

01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:54.720
Well, I think you've missed on your market research there.
