This is the Linux Action Show Unplugged, Episode 1 for August 12, 2013.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.080
Hi everyone, welcome to the Linux Action Show Unplugged. It's our first episode and that's

00:40.080 --> 00:45.320
exciting. We're doing it on a Monday afternoon. My name is Chris. My name is Matt. Hey Matt.

00:45.320 --> 00:50.400
Hey there. Sorry I didn't mean to step on you. That's okay. Sorry about that. One thing that

00:50.400 --> 00:53.560
I'm kind of looking forward to, because we never really get a chance to do it in the big show,

00:53.560 --> 00:59.160
is bring on some folks and chat with them live during the show. And we have a hangout set up.

00:59.160 --> 01:04.680
And we'll see how it works out. I'm a little concerned. We've got audio troubles, but I think

01:04.680 --> 01:08.280
it's gonna be good. It's getting a little funky. It's learning, you know, getting used to the new

01:08.280 --> 01:11.720
timing, getting used to the whole thing. It's, you know, it's definitely Google Plus being a

01:11.720 --> 01:15.560
little janky. I think what we've discovered is that the future does not lie in hangouts for this

01:15.560 --> 01:19.360
show. But already at launch, we know it's probably, we need to set up a mumble server or something.

01:19.360 --> 01:24.280
And then we'll get like people hanging out in there and we can bring them into like rooms

01:24.280 --> 01:28.600
that are designed just for the show. And then we can kick people out when they're jerks. I like

01:28.600 --> 01:34.440
that idea. In just the short time we've been on hangouts, we've had Windows 8 users stop by. That

01:34.440 --> 01:38.840
was almost offensive. But I mean, we were accepting of their choices. And we have people that didn't

01:38.840 --> 01:43.800
speak English stop by, didn't use Linux stop by. Yeah. So hangouts so far, we're a little hit and

01:43.800 --> 01:49.520
miss. But we'll bring in the panel that we have assembled later in the show as we get going. But

01:49.520 --> 01:54.000
first I want to just take a minute and talk about the new show. We don't plan to do this too often,

01:54.000 --> 01:58.120
but it's kind of an opportunity to talk about ourselves a little bit. Matt and I were kind

01:58.120 --> 02:03.960
of brainstorming on a couple of problems that the Linux action show has faced. And one has been that

02:03.960 --> 02:07.720
we just have this torrential amount of feedback that we generate every single week from every

02:07.720 --> 02:10.960
single show. And ideas sometimes on how to do something differently than how we talked about

02:10.960 --> 02:15.000
it in the show. Sometimes it's, it's, Hey, did you actually know that maybe that's not the best way

02:15.000 --> 02:19.600
to do it or anything like that, right? Exactly. And trying to find a way to present that in a

02:19.600 --> 02:23.400
way that wasn't going to just absolutely become a time suck. Right. Yeah. Cause it would drag down

02:23.400 --> 02:26.560
the whole show. Exactly. And I had, I had threatened for like a long time. I was like,

02:26.560 --> 02:29.640
one of these days, Matt, I'm going to make a feedback show and walls are going to talk

02:29.640 --> 02:33.200
about his feedback. Well, that's kind of what we're doing. Although that's not the show in,

02:33.200 --> 02:37.240
in, in its entirety, that's only going to be a component of this show. Uh, you know,

02:37.240 --> 02:40.800
I mean the feedback I think is going to generate a lot of good discussion and a lot of ideas,

02:40.800 --> 02:46.200
but I'm hoping that this show is even more of an opportunity to kind of get down into,

02:46.200 --> 02:51.120
uh, some episodes. I want to just like totally just dig into a topic and we're just going to

02:51.120 --> 02:55.680
only talk about really just that. And, you know, maybe we'll just spend an hour discussing

02:55.680 --> 02:59.400
something, just really go deep. Sometimes I want to, I want to just be all over the board and just

02:59.400 --> 03:02.840
talk about live topics that have come up throughout the week, things that people want to bring up,

03:02.840 --> 03:07.400
you know, do panel discussions kind of like we're going to try on this episode and see what works.

03:07.400 --> 03:11.160
I'm pretty excited about the prospect of it. I think it's going to be interesting to see how

03:11.160 --> 03:15.240
this comes to fruition, which direction we ended up taking it and really where the chat room guides

03:15.240 --> 03:20.320
us to. Yeah. And what from this will kind of surface up into the big show and make that an

03:20.320 --> 03:25.680
even better show. And, uh, I'm looking forward to it, but, uh, I wanted to start, I thought with,

03:25.680 --> 03:32.520
uh, the most classiest way. Um, and that would be me complaining. Always, always a classy,

03:32.520 --> 03:35.520
a classy approach, right? Like whenever you want to impress people with the new show,

03:35.520 --> 03:40.080
the first thing you want to do is try to offend a good subset of your potential listeners. That's

03:40.080 --> 03:43.800
podcast or one-on-one. Everybody knows that. I don't know why more shows don't do this.

03:43.800 --> 03:48.500
Uh, it was actually, and I, I, I can't, I can't bear all the blame. I have to put some of the

03:48.500 --> 03:54.560
blame on James 0 6 1 0 in our, uh, subreddit. He, he wrote and he got me thinking. He said,

03:54.560 --> 03:58.600
forget the arch challenge. I'm doing the KDE challenge. And he says, why am I doing this?

03:58.600 --> 04:03.920
Well, back in 2006 ish, I started to debate or I'm sorry, dabble around with Linux when I was

04:03.920 --> 04:08.520
like a kid in a sweatshop. It was, I hit a roadblock when I tried Katie. I hated it back

04:08.520 --> 04:13.480
then. It was slow. It was bad. It was old. I stayed away ever since yesterday. He says,

04:13.480 --> 04:19.240
I started to get those itchy Linux feet where I couldn't stay still on what I was using. I've

04:19.240 --> 04:24.040
been there. I've seen that myself. Instead of distro hopping, I thought maybe I would try

04:24.040 --> 04:28.160
desktop popping. I gave Katie another go to force myself to stay with it for at least a month.

04:28.160 --> 04:34.240
Here's what I found so far. The bad points, shit, default settings fixed with some tweaks.

04:34.240 --> 04:40.640
And I, uh, Matt, you know, after the, after we went off air two weeks ago, I just kind of leaned

04:40.640 --> 04:44.960
over, you know, and I said, I am so fricking tired of these ass backwards settings and Katie,

04:44.960 --> 04:47.600
every single default I have to change. Didn't I say that after the show?

04:47.600 --> 04:51.280
You almost wonder if the KDE devs are trolling users, right? I mean,

04:51.280 --> 04:55.040
who in their right mind would make these settings legit? I know it doesn't work.

04:55.040 --> 05:00.440
I, so, uh, but that said that said, you know, they let you change them, right? And boy,

05:00.440 --> 05:04.400
can you change them in any way you want. Uh, and they are fairly straightforward to set up. Then

05:04.400 --> 05:08.280
he goes on to say, uh, way too many customization options, which kind of seems like the two might

05:08.280 --> 05:12.600
be related. If I was jumping into Linux for the first time, uh, this would make me jump

05:12.600 --> 05:17.840
straight back to windows, but here's some good points. Kwin is a really good window manager.

05:17.840 --> 05:18.640
True.

05:18.640 --> 05:21.960
Yeah. I really agree with him there. I said, it can look stunning with a lot of work once

05:21.960 --> 05:24.920
you get it set up. So am I going to stick with Katie? I don't know. I'll let you know in four

05:24.920 --> 05:31.200
weeks. Well, so here's the thing. I, you know, Katie, when you've massaged the hell out of it,

05:31.200 --> 05:36.440
and I'm talking about deep tissue, hot rocks, you know, hell throwing hot rocks at it. I mean,

05:36.440 --> 05:39.840
you basically got a stone, the damn thing to make it work, right? And even when you get it there,

05:39.840 --> 05:43.520
then the sound server decides, you know what? Oh, Hey, you're using pulse and you're using that

05:43.520 --> 05:47.800
phone on thing. So we're going to really mix it up for you. That's where it kills me every time.

05:47.800 --> 05:53.920
I mean, people who were watching the live stream of last unplugged know that we spent about 15

05:53.920 --> 05:58.400
minutes just monkeying around with audio settings, trying to get it to work. Right. Um, like what?

05:58.400 --> 06:03.600
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They're there. So here's what I have. Here's what I have kind of come to with

06:03.600 --> 06:09.480
Katie. So, uh, last week after the Linux action show, I got back into my home office where I edit.

06:09.480 --> 06:14.840
And once again, my audio didn't work and I said, screw it. I restarted, I logged into

06:14.840 --> 06:20.480
gnome and I thought for myself for about three days, man, this is so nice. It's like, I'm in

06:20.480 --> 06:25.680
the garden. I wanted to go meditate on a rock, Matt. I tell you, it was beautiful. Like a

06:25.680 --> 06:31.200
Cardassian on a hot stone. I'm telling you, man. Yeah, man, those Cardassians give some damn good

06:31.200 --> 06:36.960
hot stone massages. That's right. Uh, especially when, and nevermind. Uh, anyway, so I, I, I loved

06:36.960 --> 06:46.320
it. And then I quickly realized that Katie E while it has its lumps isn't, is, is in my opinion,

06:46.320 --> 06:49.520
when you look back over the last five years of Linux desktops is the one that's going in the

06:49.520 --> 06:53.920
right direction by the longest shot. And from a, from a technology standpoint, like QT, but also

06:53.920 --> 06:58.080
from like, um, you know, an integration standpoint between all the applications, like I just, you

06:58.080 --> 07:01.280
know, learning the other day, I can right click on the volume control and switch, which device

07:01.280 --> 07:06.000
a program goes to right within the mixer. Uh, there's like, you can, you can middle click on

07:06.000 --> 07:11.760
the maximize button and it horizontally maximizes, uh, or vertically. Um, you know, this, there's a

07:11.760 --> 07:17.120
lot of little things in here that as a power user are, uh, they release dopamine in the back of my

07:17.120 --> 07:21.360
monkey brain. When I, I'm like, Oh, someone thought of me, someone thought of me. Oh man,

07:21.360 --> 07:25.360
that has bugged me for so long. I constantly get that sensation when I'm using Katie.

07:25.360 --> 07:30.720
I found it to be a mixed bag. I wouldn't go quite that far, but I would say that I find

07:30.720 --> 07:35.920
it aesthetically pleasing. I love that under arch and, or, and, or Majuro when you run it,

07:35.920 --> 07:40.720
um, you don't have that weird overheating problem with the notebooks. Um, that's one thing, at least

07:40.720 --> 07:44.080
with my netbook specifically, you know, I found the desktop environment's apparently matter.

07:44.080 --> 07:48.800
It's the weirdest thing. I don't know why Katie runs cool as ice XFCE runs like crap.

07:48.800 --> 07:52.160
How can that be though? Cause like it has compositing. So it's using.

07:52.160 --> 07:56.800
Yeah, but it's the only differential. And then I said, okay, on a, on a, just a total crack pipe

07:56.800 --> 08:00.480
thing, I went and searched it just to see if I'm nuts. No other people have experienced this.

08:00.480 --> 08:06.880
Maybe, maybe XFCE is, um, using the CPU more for rendering. Whereas, uh,

08:06.880 --> 08:11.440
But then I go to, but then when I look at my, you know, I run a top or anything else and it's like,

08:11.440 --> 08:15.200
there's nothing weird going on. It just runs hot. It just runs hot. It's like,

08:15.200 --> 08:18.080
there's nothing I can really identify for look to their logs. I can't figure it out.

08:18.080 --> 08:22.320
So it's the craziest thing. And you've noticed that you've noticed a big enough difference on, uh,

08:22.880 --> 08:27.040
Oh, I'm running Katie right now. And besides the fact that the sound server decided to play musical

08:27.040 --> 08:31.760
and let's make things disappear. Um, you know, other than that, it runs really ice cold. I mean,

08:31.760 --> 08:35.680
like I could put, I could literally cool off my soda right now by putting it on top of the computer.

08:35.680 --> 08:40.160
Huh. I actually have the opposite experience to some degree. And I think, really, I think it's

08:40.160 --> 08:44.000
because, um, I'm just, my GPU is getting hit a little more with Kaywin and I don't know.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.080
So, you know, I ended up logging out of gnome about three days, three days after the experiment

08:48.080 --> 08:51.920
started, went back onto Katie, dropped the whole unity set up said, now, you know what,

08:51.920 --> 08:56.160
I'm just going to go taskbar on the bottom standard set up with conky. I, you know,

08:56.160 --> 08:59.920
I've got that going now and I'm just trying to, I figure if I just stick with the audio

08:59.920 --> 09:05.520
problems long enough, I'll either wait out the problems with Katie and they'll just get it fixed

09:05.520 --> 09:11.040
or I'll become so adept at the, at the juggle, which I am starting to do now. Like I'm starting

09:11.040 --> 09:14.080
to be able to juggle. Like while I'm on air, like, Oh, I get changes, audio interface. Oh,

09:14.080 --> 09:18.720
unplug this USB interface, plug it in, you know, I'm starting to get the juggle down. And so maybe

09:18.720 --> 09:23.920
I'll just cope with it that way. Uh, but I do, I think there's also this concept, um, that, um,

09:23.920 --> 09:31.200
James was touching on and maybe it's more, more possible with arch, but I am now kind of like,

09:31.200 --> 09:35.760
maybe I'm just going to hang out on arch for a really long time. And whenever I feel like I'm

09:35.760 --> 09:41.040
getting that itch, I'll just install another desktop. That's the nice thing, right? Cause it's

09:41.040 --> 09:46.000
so easy to do just boom, done. Yeah. I wonder if that, the only thing is, is we're going to see,

09:46.000 --> 09:50.320
like, I've got elementary OS. I loaded it up this morning on the, on an external USB hard drive,

09:50.320 --> 09:55.280
little USB drive that I'll be running 10,000 RPM, USB three hard drive that I'll be running it on

09:55.280 --> 10:00.160
for the week. So we can talk about it on Sunday on Linux action show. And, um, I'll tell you,

10:00.160 --> 10:04.400
I'm going to save it for the review, but there's a couple aspects of a simple UI that I feel like

10:04.400 --> 10:11.200
making me a more productive user. True. And, and I know we've differed greatly on XFC to where I'm,

10:11.200 --> 10:14.720
I'm a fan of it to where basically you're saying, if I can't run a modern desktop, I'm not going to

10:14.720 --> 10:18.720
run that, that hardware. I'm just not going to do it. And I've always taken the prospect of,

10:18.720 --> 10:22.400
I'll run that lower end desktop and stuff like that. So when I look at things like AKD,

10:22.400 --> 10:25.520
I look at elementary, I look at all these things and they're, and they're pretty and all that, but

10:25.520 --> 10:32.640
for me, it just really depends on the hardware. I'm going to run it on. So I don't know. I don't

10:32.640 --> 10:35.360
know. Yeah. Yeah. I hear you. So it's something I've, I've kind of continued to evolve my stance

10:35.360 --> 10:40.320
on cause I've, I've flip flopped around a lot, but I think, um, like it all really kind of kicked

10:40.320 --> 10:46.400
off and started for me when, when unity kind of started to jump the shark. I, I would, I actually

10:46.400 --> 10:52.160
think potentially my perfect desktop maybe was Ubuntu 13.10. I don't know. I don't know. I don't

10:52.160 --> 10:59.840
know. I honestly, my perfect desktop maybe was Ubuntu 13.04, right? Yeah. Or maybe like, but,

10:59.840 --> 11:05.840
but the problem there is like unity. I wish I could take that whole desktop experience and

11:05.840 --> 11:09.120
move it to arch. Just, I know you can install unity on arch, but I just wish I could just,

11:09.840 --> 11:13.680
just lift all that top layer off and lay it down on top of the arch under layer.

11:14.320 --> 11:18.480
Um, because that UI to me was very, very efficient. That was very fast.

11:18.480 --> 11:23.280
I don't know. Yeah. I honestly, I just don't have a, I don't have a lot of love or hate for unity

11:23.280 --> 11:28.400
because I mean, I'm actually running a Skype right now on a unity desktop on a, on a Ubuntu box. And

11:28.400 --> 11:33.920
honestly, I just, it's come to a point where 13.04, I don't care if it slows down worse. I

11:33.920 --> 11:38.720
probably will stick to this for quite a while. I mean, you'll see if you upgrade 13.10, you'll

11:38.720 --> 11:42.720
see what I'm talking about. Oh, that's so unfortunate. What a dumb thing to do. You know,

11:42.720 --> 11:46.320
the other thing too is like with arch is, uh, and with all the other distributions too, they're kind

11:46.320 --> 11:50.000
of now that canonical is going off on their own path. I don't feel like I'm as connected to what

11:50.000 --> 11:53.520
the community is working on, on that desktop. So it's got a lot of exactly what they're exactly.

11:53.520 --> 11:56.960
There's a lot going against it. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of drama. Exactly. And I just

11:56.960 --> 12:01.760
don't care for the drama. Yeah. So, uh, there you go. I switched back. I'm back. I'm living on KD.

12:01.760 --> 12:04.320
And Matt, you are too. It's interesting. You're kind of flipping a little bit too.

12:04.320 --> 12:08.480
Well, see, and I run all kinds of stuff. It's like kind of give you a heads up with the setup. I'm

12:08.480 --> 12:13.440
running right at this very moment. Behind me is my Mungero slash arch setup. You know, usually I

12:13.440 --> 12:18.560
run Mungero primarily. Uh, that's, you know, and that's running XFC happily on a, on a desktop

12:18.560 --> 12:23.040
in front of me now, because I've turned to my other desks. I basically have the Ubuntu setup,

12:23.040 --> 12:27.520
where I've got the Skype thing going on right now. And then on a netbook, I actually have, uh,

12:27.520 --> 12:33.280
I believe it's actually arch with KD. So I think we are in a position right now where

12:33.840 --> 12:36.800
what we're not talking about, I don't know, maybe this is my impression, but the elephant to me in

12:36.800 --> 12:40.720
the room seems like nobody's a hundred percent happy with any living's desktop anymore.

12:40.720 --> 12:44.160
Nobody's a hundred percent happy with any living's desktop anymore. And we're all trying

12:44.160 --> 12:50.560
different things out and nothing's really quite sticking. And I feel like, um, the one KDE that

12:50.560 --> 12:54.480
has the most potential, even still, there's some districts out there that are given a great shot

12:54.480 --> 13:01.040
and really make a great looking KDE desktop, but still nothing is just out. Like why isn't

13:01.040 --> 13:06.240
somebody going at all elementary OS with QT and KDE? Like why isn't that happening? Why aren't we

13:06.240 --> 13:16.720
getting the most, you know, refined artisanal KDE desktop that could sort of shake this whole,

13:16.720 --> 13:20.560
this whole situation up a little bit and slap people in the face and look what you can do with

13:20.560 --> 13:28.560
KD. Why aren't we seeing this? Why are we only seeing cinnamon and mate and the elementary OS

13:28.560 --> 13:34.560
desktop environment? Why are we seeing all of this stuff? And we're not seeing anybody go after QT,

13:34.560 --> 13:39.520
KDE, and let's just make a great, let's bring it down, let's whittle it down to the finest elements.

13:39.520 --> 13:43.600
And instead what was, and so what we see, what you and I see, we see all of our audience members

13:43.600 --> 13:46.320
out there that are constantly saying, well, I'm trying this. Oh, I don't like this. Oh,

13:46.320 --> 13:49.440
I moved to this. We're always constantly moving around. Some of that's because we're geeks,

13:49.440 --> 13:54.320
but I think a lot of it is because most of the time it's not good enough. Like I'll give you

13:54.320 --> 13:58.960
an example, Dolphin, amazing file manager, super fast flies through my directories,

13:58.960 --> 14:04.160
can't play video files off of Samba share. Right? Yeah. I don't like file handling in

14:04.160 --> 14:09.600
KDE at all. It's just obnoxious. Even right clicking makes me cringe. It's just, I don't

14:09.600 --> 14:14.400
know what it is, but the way they do things is so ass backwards. Yeah. And then of course,

14:14.400 --> 14:19.280
inside of Dolphin is another great example of it. My biggest gripe, I can make KDE work fine.

14:19.280 --> 14:25.760
If even if I could, I can handle all the other crap if they just did one thing and just dealt

14:25.760 --> 14:30.960
with allowing pulse audio and the, they could, they could make that work properly. I would be

14:30.960 --> 14:34.880
fine with it. And I probably am going to make this a project now because I want to make this work

14:34.880 --> 14:40.160
because I can't really, you know, Gnome just makes me want to throw up. I just can't, I can't do it.

14:40.160 --> 14:44.320
I tried. It just, it just doesn't really for me. We get notes. We get notes from people that say

14:44.320 --> 14:47.520
that, you know, no one works great for them. And it was working really good for me for a long time,

14:47.520 --> 14:52.000
but I just get really twitchy about that much functionality being driven by plugins.

14:52.000 --> 14:58.640
And I'll tell you, I think it was right before the show started or during the show. I can't

14:58.640 --> 15:03.840
remember the amount of it actually happened during the show. I went to click on my, this is actually

15:03.840 --> 15:07.440
why I stopped. One of the reasons I stopped using Gnome again, I went to click on my volume applet

15:07.440 --> 15:12.960
in my menu bar and I accidentally clicked on the imager extension, which had been up until that

15:12.960 --> 15:17.360
point, a great extension where I click on imager, then I draw a box on my screen, whatever I draw,

15:17.360 --> 15:21.920
it takes a snapshot of and immediately uploads it to imager and then puts the URL on my clipboard.

15:21.920 --> 15:25.360
Right. Super handy. Like, Hey, like when I'm chatting in the ice, I'm like, Hey, check out

15:25.360 --> 15:31.040
this screenshot. And I just, you know, click, drag, boom, done. Accidentally clicked the imager extension

15:31.040 --> 15:35.840
in my menu bar, whole gnome session, totally freaks the F out. Not just like the normal gnome

15:35.840 --> 15:40.560
where like things close and then like zooms back in, but like pair, like freaking like epileptic

15:40.560 --> 15:44.880
shock flashing on my screen, flash, flash, flash, flash, flash, like just nonstop. Couldn't go to the

15:44.880 --> 15:50.000
text terminal. Everything was all screwed up. I had to hard reboot the machine because I clicked

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
the imager extension. Oh my gosh. See, that's what I'm talking about. That's why I can't,

15:54.000 --> 15:58.320
I can't deal with gnome, even with all Unity's flaws, although the audio is a big one, but the

15:58.320 --> 16:01.920
rest of them, for me, they're paper cuts. They're minor. They're just not a big deal.

16:01.920 --> 16:06.000
See, skyshaper thinks I'm bashing that gnome through because of a plugin, but I don't, Matt,

16:06.000 --> 16:09.200
am I wrong? Or don't you think the desktop environment should be designed to protect

16:09.200 --> 16:11.760
you from a plugin crash like that? Well, the whole, here's the problem with

16:11.760 --> 16:15.280
gnome, my experience anywhere with gnome is that as you pointed out, everything's

16:15.280 --> 16:18.400
based around extensions and all these plugins and stuff. So it's a little bit like saying,

16:18.400 --> 16:21.680
okay, I'm going to take a green Pinto and I'm going to drop a brand new engine in it.

16:21.680 --> 16:24.320
Then I'm going to put some electric windows. I'm going to get a new sound system. I'm going to do

16:24.320 --> 16:28.400
all this other stuff. And it's all going to coordinate through one flux capacitor.

16:28.400 --> 16:32.080
And okay, wait a minute. Now that sounds kind of cool to be honest with you.

16:32.080 --> 16:37.440
But it's like, and then let's say your sound system goes capulli on you. And because it's

16:37.440 --> 16:41.520
all wired through the same doohickey, everything in the car goes to crap. Well, that's essentially

16:41.520 --> 16:46.560
what's happening in gnome because of one stupid plugin, something can create that kind of headache.

16:46.560 --> 16:50.160
That's a real problem. Now with KDE on the other hand, it's different because of the fact that you

16:50.160 --> 16:56.000
are looking at, in my opinion, anyway, you know, these are, they're minor issues. Again, excluding

16:56.000 --> 16:59.840
audio because that's not minor, but as far as like the way it behaves and stuff that it's annoying,

16:59.840 --> 17:04.400
but it's not taking a crap out on me every time I click something. Yeah. You know, I don't like

17:04.400 --> 17:09.120
the usability point of it so much, but you know, I can make it work. KDE seems to me no more

17:09.120 --> 17:14.720
esoteric than learning the ins and outs of windows or, or, you know, another complex operating. It's

17:14.720 --> 17:18.720
windows seven to me, really. I mean, it really, it's about, it's kind of a meh kind of experience.

17:18.720 --> 17:22.320
It's not bad. It's just not great. Well, why don't we, before we move off this topic,

17:22.320 --> 17:26.560
try and bring it in the hangout and see hangout guys. Somebody, somebody there say something.

17:26.560 --> 17:30.160
Mr. Bacon there. You got a shirt on. It says bacon and you were drinking a beer. Yeah. I

17:30.160 --> 17:34.080
like that. That's a nice shirt, dude. That's a great, that's a nice looking beer too. Now is

17:34.080 --> 17:40.560
your mic on? Oh, hold on. He's going to unmute. Hi there. All right. No, I still don't hear you.

17:40.560 --> 17:44.320
I still don't hear you, but I like, I like your shirt still. And he's got a whiteboard behind him

17:44.320 --> 17:49.840
too, Matt. Yeah. He's set up and he's prepared. He's got a pretty swank lamp too. And I don't

17:49.840 --> 17:53.520
even know why I haven't mentioned this dude has a huge ass beard. That's a great looking beard,

17:53.520 --> 17:59.440
man. I love that beard. There you go. Welcome to the show. Oh, I had you for a second.

18:01.440 --> 18:06.160
Well, I'll open this up to the general panel. So anybody on the hangout who has a working mic,

18:06.800 --> 18:12.160
what are your thoughts on, is the Linux desktop just not yet there or Matt and I just spinning

18:12.160 --> 18:17.360
our wheels and we just need to settle down and learn to love what we got. Anybody on there?

18:19.040 --> 18:27.840
I think the point of, sorry to interrupt. Oh, go ahead. Just say your name. I think the point of

18:27.840 --> 18:32.240
the Linux desktop is you don't have to settle on just one thing. You could jump around. That's the

18:32.240 --> 18:37.280
beauty of it. You're not stuck with one interface. So I don't really have an issue with people

18:37.280 --> 18:44.960
jumping from KDE to Gnome, to Unity, to LXD, to Clide, to Enlightenment and so on and so forth.

18:46.000 --> 18:51.520
Because it's about having that freedom, having that choice. So that's the beauty of Linux.

18:51.520 --> 18:54.000
You can always move around. Anybody else want to chime in?

18:55.360 --> 19:02.880
Well, I can say that I'm one of the few Unity lovers. I've tried a number of different desktops,

19:02.880 --> 19:09.200
but this Unity satisfies me, does exactly what I want to do. So I'm happy with Unity.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.720
Now, which version of Ubuntu are you on?

19:11.360 --> 19:12.800
1204 LTS.

19:12.800 --> 19:14.400
And you just kind of plan to hang out there for a while?

19:15.280 --> 19:21.920
Absolutely. I like to get one set up that'll do what I want to do and leave it there because I

19:21.920 --> 19:22.560
use it.

19:22.560 --> 19:26.240
Do you have any concerns about some of the desktop software you use kind of

19:26.240 --> 19:31.440
falling behind in versions? Or has that not been a problem in your experience?

19:31.440 --> 19:33.120
No, it's not been a problem for me.

19:33.120 --> 19:39.360
Yeah. I think that if I, you know, I wonder too, if I was kind of more in a traditional sort of

19:39.360 --> 19:44.880
work environment or office environment, I think I would probably just run an LTS or something like

19:44.880 --> 19:49.440
that. But because I'm kind of in the position where I always kind of want fresh hot off the

19:49.440 --> 19:53.120
presses code, you know, it kind of pushes me in a different direction myself.

19:53.120 --> 19:55.920
Well, I can understand his perspective on that because if you think about it,

19:55.920 --> 19:59.680
he has something that works well. He has the applications he enjoys using.

19:59.680 --> 20:03.200
It's no must, no fuss. He knows he boots it up. It's going to start. It's going to run.

20:03.200 --> 20:06.720
His apps are going to work as he expects. I can definitely see the benefit of that.

20:06.720 --> 20:08.800
Yeah. Now, Dan, were you going to say something?

20:08.800 --> 20:13.040
Yeah, I'm sorry. I just wanted to put a little aspect on this. I mean, what was the question?

20:13.040 --> 20:15.360
Is it ready for full on mainstream or?

20:16.400 --> 20:21.120
No, not even that. Because I think what we're running into is even as non-mainstream users,

20:21.120 --> 20:26.560
it still seems to have, it still seems to fall short as a complete inclusive solution. Like

20:26.560 --> 20:31.040
you have, I constantly am seeing threads from people trying Gnome for a few weeks, trying KDE,

20:31.040 --> 20:38.160
then going to XFCE, then going to a tiling window manager. And I think to me, that seems to suggest

20:38.160 --> 20:43.360
that none of these desktops are fully baked, that they're not solving 100% of the problems

20:43.360 --> 20:48.080
for everybody, maybe not even 70% of the problems. And I think instead of just admitting that as

20:48.080 --> 20:51.600
Linux users, we kind of gloss over it and say, well, we have choice.

20:51.600 --> 20:57.040
Yeah, we do. But the downside to that is, you're right, we don't have a one world solution. Unity

20:57.040 --> 21:02.080
is probably one of the closer ones to that, but everybody, let's say some people like to look down

21:02.080 --> 21:07.680
on the Ubuntu users. But if it works for you, like, I forgot his name, but all the gentlemen

21:07.680 --> 21:11.360
there, great. If it works for you, there's no reason you shouldn't use it. If it's happy,

21:11.360 --> 21:13.360
it makes you happy and it works.

21:13.360 --> 21:14.640
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

21:14.640 --> 21:22.640
But we do need a slim, fast desktop environment that does have everything without having to make

21:22.640 --> 21:24.880
compromises. And I think that's what we are lacking.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.240
And so in your opinion, KDE or Gnome or any of those haven't solved that for you?

21:30.800 --> 21:37.440
Well, I felt it with Gnome 2 a long time ago. I thought I had everything, but I was really,

21:37.440 --> 21:43.200
really new to that. But I wasn't missing anything. But with KDE, I felt like I had everything.

21:43.200 --> 21:47.280
I wasn't missing anything. But with KDE, I kept having to think, wow, crap, I'm missing out.

21:48.480 --> 21:50.480
So I went back over and over again.

21:50.480 --> 21:52.000
Yeah. Yeah. Interesting.

21:52.800 --> 21:54.480
All right. Anybody else on the Hangout? Yeah, go ahead.

21:57.920 --> 21:58.640
Hey, Michael.

21:59.760 --> 22:01.280
Oh, you're kind of cutting out, Michael.

22:01.280 --> 22:01.840
You hear me?

22:01.840 --> 22:03.200
Yeah, a little bit. Go ahead and try.

22:03.200 --> 22:04.000
Do you hear me?

22:04.000 --> 22:04.160
Yeah.

22:05.520 --> 22:10.640
I've been using Mate and Sim in the last year. I've been

22:10.640 --> 22:17.760
very active with both of them. I've been using them on Mint and on Arch.

22:17.760 --> 22:18.240
Mate, huh?

22:20.880 --> 22:23.840
All right, you're breaking up. I'm going to cut you off there. But Mate, that's interesting.

22:23.840 --> 22:27.040
That's all right. I didn't expect that. I didn't see that coming. I didn't see Mate coming.

22:27.040 --> 22:30.080
But I'll be honest, I don't judge.

22:30.080 --> 22:36.160
Well, and I understand that, you know, I actually was a big Gnome 2 fan. So I understand the desire

22:36.160 --> 22:40.240
to use Mate from the standpoint of, you know what you're getting, you know where everything's at,

22:40.240 --> 22:43.760
you've got your little applets. I mean, everything's kind of predictable. You know exactly what you're

22:43.760 --> 22:48.320
going to get. And it's, you know, it's a pleasant enough interface for someone that just wants

22:48.320 --> 22:53.920
functionality. They're not looking for a lot of eye candy. You know, and I think that certainly

22:53.920 --> 22:57.440
presents an interesting point. One thing that struck me, though, is everyone was talking that

22:57.440 --> 23:02.880
I realized that Windows users and OS X users, they may have an all-in-one solution. But what's

23:02.880 --> 23:07.520
interesting, if they hate something about their desktop environment, that's too bad with us.

23:07.520 --> 23:08.800
They become Linux users.

23:08.800 --> 23:14.960
Yeah, exactly. Totally right. That's exactly it. And so for us, we are spoiled in that we have

23:14.960 --> 23:17.520
something to complain about because we have that option.

23:17.520 --> 23:22.240
I guess so. And I do agree with you. And I have made that argument myself. But like I said,

23:23.040 --> 23:28.480
I just don't want that to be sort of an excuse to cover up the fact that nothing's all that great.

23:28.480 --> 23:32.640
Well, I mean, yeah, I mean, KD might have sound issues and Gnome has extension crashing problems

23:32.640 --> 23:37.200
and XFCE might feel like it's from the 90s and Unity's controlled by an egomaniac. But at least

23:37.200 --> 23:39.040
you have choice.

23:39.040 --> 23:44.080
But here's the point that you may have overskipped on a little bit. Think of it this way. Think of

23:44.080 --> 23:49.600
it this way. So we know that Gnome and KDE and even some of the lighter weight desktops, they're

23:49.600 --> 23:53.760
not going to change unless they want to. That's just reality. Unity, same thing. They're going to

23:53.760 --> 23:59.120
do whatever the hell they please. But some of these other guys, Cinnamon, I think it was

23:59.120 --> 24:03.200
elementary OS and all this kind of doing their own thing with desktop stuff. I think that's where

24:03.200 --> 24:07.280
we're going to begin seeing more stuff develop out of projects like that. And that's probably where

24:07.280 --> 24:10.960
the solution is going to come from. Isn't it funny though, because those guys get some of the biggest

24:10.960 --> 24:14.880
pushback because elementary gets, oh, it's a Mac clone and Cinnamon gets, oh, what's the point?

24:14.880 --> 24:19.520
You're just wasting effort and resources. But in reality, maybe they're going to shake things up

24:19.520 --> 24:22.960
the most. They're doing some of the most interesting differentiation out of all of them.

24:23.840 --> 24:28.960
IBM once said there was absolutely no money in software. They were wrong. I think the people that

24:28.960 --> 24:33.040
are saying that all this, oh, you don't need to make it look like this or make it look like that,

24:33.040 --> 24:37.360
are also wrong. I think that history will show us that. I think over time we will actually see that

24:37.360 --> 24:42.960
happen and they can complain all they want. Yeah. It is a long game, right? And of course,

24:42.960 --> 24:47.280
we are the sports commentators that are here watching the game as it unfolds,

24:48.000 --> 24:54.560
but it is a long game. All right. So it sounds like you're trying to type,

24:54.560 --> 24:58.560
so we've muted your mic. Gosh, Google Plus is really something. How about our Google? Look

24:58.560 --> 25:04.720
at that. Look at Google. Hey, hey, hey, Jackass, quit typing it says. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. All

25:04.720 --> 25:09.760
right. Well, before we move to the next kind of quasi topic, we don't have real topics. We do have

25:09.760 --> 25:15.760
a couple of real sponsors that I wanted to thank. The first one, this one, I am so thrilled because

25:15.760 --> 25:21.760
I know someone out in our audience is going to have a much better day after they hear about Unity

25:21.760 --> 25:27.040
Sync from Directory Wizards. And Unity Sync, its version 2.0 came out towards the end of August,

25:27.040 --> 25:33.120
runs on Linux, and it will allow you to move information between multiple types of directories.

25:33.120 --> 25:36.400
So you think of like maybe with Unity Sync, you could synchronize account information

25:36.400 --> 25:40.560
between different LDAP directories you might have in your network. Oh, there goes my bottle cap.

25:40.560 --> 25:45.840
Or maybe you might have something like an HR application that stores something in some crappy

25:45.840 --> 25:51.920
Microsoft SQL database and you want to sync that out to MySQL or to an LDAP directory. So that way

25:51.920 --> 25:57.920
when HR updates a phone number, that S moves over to that directory you have for IT. So that way

25:57.920 --> 26:01.920
everybody's phone numbers on the company intranet automatically get updated. All these kinds of

26:01.920 --> 26:05.600
little things where you have data that exists in all these different directories, but nothing's

26:05.600 --> 26:10.240
been intelligent enough to move them all together. Well, on top of that, not only is Unity Sync built

26:10.240 --> 26:16.320
to do that, but it also can do things like templates. So you can say when data gets

26:16.320 --> 26:20.960
entered into a field doesn't match this, don't sync that. Or only sync these attributes of the

26:20.960 --> 26:24.800
directory. Don't sync the entire directory. Don't sync the entire tree. Just go down the tree into

26:24.800 --> 26:30.560
this particular area and grab just those attributes. This is solving that age old IT problem.

26:30.560 --> 26:36.480
And man, oh man, did I run into this stuff. Especially when I had clients who merged companies

26:36.480 --> 26:40.800
so they'd have separate active directories or separate LDAP directories and they wanted to keep

26:40.800 --> 26:44.720
them separate for a while, but then they wanted to have some accounts like the admin account and the

26:44.720 --> 26:48.560
CEO account. They want to sync those between the directories. Can you just sync those for me real

26:48.560 --> 26:52.960
quick? Thanks. Yeah. Unity Sync takes care of that. Listen, if you go over to durwiz.com,

26:52.960 --> 26:56.640
click on the download link, put in the code Linux, you'll get an extended 30 day trial

26:56.640 --> 27:01.760
and your first year of maintenance for freezels. Yeah, that's right. For frizzles. I said it,

27:01.760 --> 27:05.600
I said it. So go to durwiz.com and while you're over there and you're looking at Unity Sync,

27:05.600 --> 27:08.720
check out some of their customers. They have it linked on the left-hand side of the page

27:09.280 --> 27:13.280
and customers include things like, oh, the air force command to control information systems of

27:13.280 --> 27:19.680
Canada. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, uh, it goes, the list goes on and on. Fiserv is in here. Um,

27:20.320 --> 27:27.920
the, uh, the DOA, the DIA, the DC court, the DC council, um, the, uh, the, uh, there was one that

27:27.920 --> 27:34.400
was Pentagon telecommunications center is in here. Omnicom is in here. Uh, the us army force com is

27:34.400 --> 27:38.000
in here. Uh, us Marine Corps is in here. Us special operations command is in here. We're

27:38.000 --> 27:42.240
talking enterprise grade and it's under five megabytes. You can get it downloaded and loaded

27:42.240 --> 27:47.200
on your Linux box in no time and then manage it with a super easy to use web front end.

27:47.200 --> 27:52.880
Gotta love that. Go to durwiz.com, click on unity sync and put in the code Linux to grab the demo

27:52.880 --> 27:58.720
and enjoy the magic. Thanks to a unity sync for sponsoring last unplugged. That's awesome. Thanks

27:58.720 --> 28:01.760
guys. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. I heard about that. I'm like, dude, we want to be on that. We want to

28:01.760 --> 28:06.320
be on that. That's cool. I got one little tip that I mentioned just briefly today on Coder radio,

28:06.320 --> 28:10.800
uh, before we move on. And I, that is, uh, I, I didn't talk about it on last, but I had an,

28:10.800 --> 28:14.720
I had a nexus seven. I think I've mentioned that on the show. In fact, I loaded Ubuntu touch on

28:14.720 --> 28:20.960
there one time. Well, so the, the nexus seven is plagued by a little bug that nobody, no Google

28:20.960 --> 28:25.680
advocate ever talks about. And if this happened to the iPad, people would be up in arms about it.

28:25.680 --> 28:29.440
And it's an interesting, it's a, it is an interesting example of how the tech press

28:30.000 --> 28:34.320
doesn't ride Google the way they should for some of this stuff. So turns out nexus seven,

28:34.320 --> 28:39.040
you let it die all the way, can't charge it. You drain the battery all the way, not going to charge.

28:39.040 --> 28:43.760
That's a problem. Yeah. That's not even cool. Yeah. People drain their tablets, Matt. That happens.

28:43.760 --> 28:47.520
Oh man. Yeah. I mean, who doesn't? I mean, that's the whole point. And you can't recover from that,

28:47.520 --> 28:51.600
especially when you have two kids, right? So the charger is initiated by software. So the

28:51.600 --> 28:55.360
charging process doesn't start until you boot into Android and Android says, yeah,

28:55.360 --> 28:59.520
start charging that battery for me. Well, if the battery doesn't, if the battery doesn't have

28:59.520 --> 29:03.360
enough charge, what happens is you boot in, even if it's plugged in, you boot into Android,

29:03.360 --> 29:09.680
immediately Android says, oh dude, oh dude, you got 0% battery better reboot. So it goes into a

29:09.680 --> 29:15.040
shutdown process. That shutdown process has some sort of video card driver crash. And then you get

29:15.040 --> 29:20.480
static snow on the screen. Like you got on your old TV and then it shuts off and then it boots again

29:20.480 --> 29:24.480
and it does it all over again. And it just loops and loops until the battery is so dead. You can't

29:24.480 --> 29:29.200
even get it to power on. So I let my, I was kind of mad at it. So I let it sit for a little while.

29:29.200 --> 29:33.280
I found out if it's really, really, really dead, which you have to do is grab the original

29:33.280 --> 29:38.720
Asus power brick and the original Asus USB power cord, plug those in, let it sit for like an hour.

29:38.720 --> 29:42.400
It won't turn on. It won't respond to your power button. So don't even press it. Just let it sit

29:42.400 --> 29:47.680
for like an hour. Okay. Then, you know, this is really funny after the, after you let it sit for

29:47.680 --> 29:52.960
an hour, you pull the power cord count for 10 seconds, then plug the power cord back in. Okay.

29:53.600 --> 29:59.520
After you've plugged the power cord back in, hold down the power button and the, let's see,

29:59.520 --> 30:04.240
let's see. I think it's the down arrow, the down volume area and press. Yeah. Hold that

30:04.240 --> 30:08.160
until you start to see the bootloader come up. Then when the bootloader comes up,

30:08.160 --> 30:14.080
choose power off and then it will charge while powered off. That is the stupidest design I've

30:14.080 --> 30:19.200
ever heard. It's ridiculous. I mean, that is just crazy stupid, but I was able to rescue my Nexus 7

30:19.200 --> 30:23.120
and get, uh, that's good. Yeah. I mean, you know, after an encyclopedia of reading, you were able

30:23.120 --> 30:26.880
to recover something. It should have been, I mean, oh my God. I will link to the Google

30:26.880 --> 30:32.640
article in the show notes. Uh, if you guys, uh, run, I, I got to imagine, I mean, tablets die

30:32.640 --> 30:36.000
and kids leave them playing video games. I mean, I'm sure some angry birds were just chewing through

30:36.000 --> 30:42.560
the battery for awhile. Uh, so I, I, I fixed that up and then I, uh, I, uh, wiped it with four and,

30:42.560 --> 30:46.000
you know, four, three stock. And then I gave that to my grandpa for his 80th birthday.

30:46.960 --> 30:51.440
So now I am Nexus free. I was honestly, I think part of the reason was because this happened to

30:51.440 --> 30:55.360
me twice. The first time I was able to get into the bootloader myself, but the, the second time

30:55.360 --> 30:59.120
this letting the charge for an hour and then unplugging it for 10 seconds and then plugging

30:59.120 --> 31:03.760
it back in. That was the secret magic to actually get it to work this last time. And I was just so

31:03.760 --> 31:07.840
frustrated with it. And my, you know, I figured my grandpa, he's been wanting to play with Android.

31:07.840 --> 31:11.840
He's 80 years old. He got an 80 year old man saying, I'd like to play with Android for three.

31:12.640 --> 31:16.480
How do you say no to that? Oh, totally. And what a great opportunity to kind of be introduced to

31:16.480 --> 31:22.000
the whole experience. But, but yeah, that whole battery drain thing, just, it escapes me how

31:22.000 --> 31:27.520
things like that, you know, leave quality assurance. And that's, that's a thumbs up.

31:27.520 --> 31:31.760
How does that even process? I know people not use their own products. I don't understand.

31:31.760 --> 31:37.760
It is weird. Like I've had issues on, on a couple of, I don't have, I haven't really had any weird

31:37.760 --> 31:43.280
issues on my note too, or my HTC one, but all of my previous Android devices, like, and I've had a

31:43.280 --> 31:47.440
few have all had weird bugs that nobody really talks about. And then when you like dig around

31:47.440 --> 31:50.160
the XDA forms, you can see like people in the know are talking about it.

31:50.160 --> 31:53.280
Right. But like nobody else is talking about it. I was like, come on, isn't this kind of,

31:53.280 --> 31:55.920
isn't this kind of like something that people should be pissed off about?

31:55.920 --> 32:01.040
I would hope so. I mean, good grief. Yeah. I think you're right. I think the press is giving them a

32:01.040 --> 32:06.080
huge pass. I think that the end users are saying, well, you know, it's okay. Google's awesome. Or

32:06.080 --> 32:11.840
they're becoming like Apple users. Yes, yes, exactly. You know, and maybe, and maybe, I don't

32:11.840 --> 32:16.320
know, maybe it's a little, I don't know if it's more deserved in this case, maybe, but I mean,

32:16.320 --> 32:24.000
we're sitting here with a Google hangout going right now. That kind of doesn't mix well. It's

32:24.000 --> 32:28.400
like, yeah, I get, I get that. But at the same time, I have a high enough expectation for

32:28.400 --> 32:31.600
usability. I mean, didn't they go out and like hire Kevin Rose to do this stuff or something,

32:31.600 --> 32:36.000
right? I mean, wasn't he supposed to do this? Oh, he's doing VC crap. I thought he was, I thought

32:36.000 --> 32:40.720
he's working for Google doing something. No, he is. Yeah. He's doing VC like Google has an arms,

32:40.720 --> 32:46.400
Google, a Google ventures arm. Okay. Where they just go around giving money to people, I suppose.

32:46.400 --> 32:49.600
Well, he used to troll stuff for usability. I'm just saying they need to cue him in and get

32:49.600 --> 32:53.200
something going because whatever's going on isn't working. Whoever's in charge of Q and A needs to

32:53.200 --> 32:57.760
be slapped. I'm just going to put that out there. I kind of, I kind of want a Moto X though. I'm a

32:57.760 --> 33:03.200
con man. All right. Well, we got an email in the show from Mike and he said, first of all,

33:03.200 --> 33:06.480
congrats to you and Angela, the new member of the family. Thanks, Mike. I wanted to complain a little

33:06.480 --> 33:10.880
bit about what you're saying about Ubuntu since you started using Arch. I'm a software developer

33:10.880 --> 33:15.840
and an Ubuntu user and I use Ubuntu on my desktop without being a Linux expert. For example, during

33:15.840 --> 33:20.560
the last episode of last you spent, and this is came in on July 30th, so it's a little behind.

33:20.560 --> 33:26.560
Okay. For example, in the last episode of last, you, you specified Arch use system D. I did not

33:26.560 --> 33:30.240
know what that was before I had, and I, before you mentioned it and I had to Google it. I know you

33:30.240 --> 33:34.560
prefer Arch, but what are your, but what are your, I know you prefer Arch, but you are an experienced

33:34.560 --> 33:40.240
Linux system admin and a Linux guy. For normal users, Ubuntu is a lot easier. I, it was window,

33:40.240 --> 33:44.160
it was a Windows user who occasionally dual booted with Windows and Fedora, OpenSUSE, PC, Linux OS,

33:44.160 --> 33:48.960
Ubuntu, MintSUSE, and Ubuntu 12.04, and I'm not dual booting anymore. This is the OS I feel like

33:48.960 --> 33:54.720
can replace Windows for me, and I think it's smooth, user-friendly. I watched Last Encoder Radio

33:54.720 --> 33:58.240
for some time now, and when you took the Arch challenge, I decided to try Arch too, first in a

33:58.240 --> 34:04.800
VM, then dual booting alongside Ubuntu. And I also tried in Terragros and Manjaro, and they all

34:04.800 --> 34:09.920
bombed on him. So he's back on Ubuntu. Yeah. So a couple thoughts, and I'll try and run through

34:09.920 --> 34:13.600
these quickly. Ubuntu is awesome for those, you know, if it's working for you, just like with any

34:13.600 --> 34:17.360
Linux distro, if it's working for you, then that is the distro for you. That's a great choice. And

34:17.360 --> 34:22.880
I certainly run it for certain purposes and not for others. Going back to the whole Arch and

34:22.880 --> 34:28.160
Manjaro and some of these other things, Arch is an advanced distribution for people that are power

34:28.160 --> 34:32.480
users in Linux. I mean, that really want to control every single aspect of their experience. It's a

34:32.480 --> 34:35.360
Tinker's distro, right? It's a Tinker's distro. It's like you're a car guy, and you like to

34:35.360 --> 34:40.880
mark on your car. And then Manjaro, of course, is, and they don't talk about this enough, but it is

34:40.880 --> 34:46.160
very much still in beta. So it's got some issues, and it's a rolling release. So a lot of times,

34:46.160 --> 34:49.840
the headaches you're dealing with are fixed in an update. So that's something to put out there as

34:49.840 --> 34:55.600
well. That's one reason why I like Arch or Manjaro over Ubuntu is that I don't have to cross my

34:55.600 --> 34:59.600
fingers every time I run the updater and hope it doesn't crap out on me because it does, and it has

34:59.600 --> 35:04.080
happened. So, Ubuntu is awesome. I haven't been bit yet, although VirtualBox has died on me twice

35:04.080 --> 35:08.640
now after an update, but other than that, and I was able to recover both times after slight

35:08.640 --> 35:13.920
consternation. Absolutely right. And so there's nothing wrong with running Ubuntu at all. I'm

35:13.920 --> 35:18.640
actually Skyping in on Ubuntu right now. That doesn't mean it's my primary desktop. I use

35:18.640 --> 35:21.840
different things for everything. So we're not ripping on it in completion. We're simply saying

35:21.840 --> 35:25.120
its current direction scares the hell out of us. It scares the hell out of me anyway.

35:25.120 --> 35:30.880
He also mentions, though, by the way, that he's landed on Unity. I'm sorry, XFCE.

35:30.880 --> 35:34.000
Oh, XFCE. That's good. Okay. That's cool. Yeah.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.560
Yeah. That's interesting. All right. An email came in from Tom. He said,

35:36.560 --> 35:40.720
Hi, Chris and Matt. It's good that you cover Linux features like Mint and Zorin OS that can

35:40.720 --> 35:44.240
help ease the transition of Windows users to Linux. However, I feel something is still missing

35:44.240 --> 35:48.240
with these reviews of Linux that the majority of Windows users are scared of not having.

35:48.240 --> 35:55.200
Okay. Windows-like, active security, and visible security. The problem is that most Windows users

35:55.200 --> 36:00.800
are used to software firewalls that prompt them to allow or deny permanent rules or every time

36:00.800 --> 36:05.120
they connect to the Internet. On a standard Linux install, the firewall is off by default. Perhaps

36:05.120 --> 36:09.200
even not seeing an animated network firewall icon on the taskbar could put some off. Having

36:09.200 --> 36:13.600
antivirus software block a webpage, for example, that has malicious code injected into it not only

36:13.600 --> 36:18.400
protects the Windows user, but alerts them that the site is hijacked and could siphon their

36:18.400 --> 36:23.520
credentials. This is where I think Linux needs an antivirus and the fact that Linux doesn't need an

36:23.520 --> 36:28.720
antivirus argument fails. Can you, Chris, Matt, and the chatroom suggest how to overcome the issues

36:28.720 --> 36:33.440
of easy firewall antivirus-like protection on the Internet and more visible security on Linux?

36:33.440 --> 36:37.280
I, of course, am interested in this as I do a boot, but I still find myself using Windows

36:37.280 --> 36:41.680
more than I'd like to. I suspect others are in a similar situation. Sorry for that long email.

36:41.680 --> 36:47.440
Great show and thanks for reading all of that. Two things. One, no argument from me. I think

36:47.440 --> 36:53.040
that Linux users are living in la-la land when it comes to the belief that they're somehow protected

36:53.040 --> 37:00.080
from malware. That's absolute crap. Second thing though, yes, there are absolutely antiviruses

37:00.080 --> 37:06.080
that exist currently that do a fantastic job at dealing with Windows viruses on your Linux box.

37:06.080 --> 37:11.200
And for those new things that crop up occasionally in the Linux space as far as viruses,

37:11.200 --> 37:14.640
it'll take care of that as well. As far as having the alerts and stuff, I think that would be a

37:14.640 --> 37:18.560
great idea, but that would require either a corporation getting involved or a nonprofit

37:18.560 --> 37:22.880
or maybe some sort of crowdfunding environment to create something like that to happen.

37:22.880 --> 37:26.160
We just haven't come to critical mass yet to where that's going to take place.

37:27.120 --> 37:32.240
The apps already at the underlying level exist, but it's the bubbling,

37:32.240 --> 37:34.400
the little bubbles and the alerts and the fluidity.

37:34.400 --> 37:38.720
Okay, let me ask you this though, Matt. Don't you feel like this is maybe our opportunity to break

37:38.720 --> 37:44.800
clean of this environment of fear that companies like Norton and McAfee have sustained for years

37:44.800 --> 37:49.440
on the Windows platform to essentially manipulate Windows users into being scared to buy their

37:49.440 --> 37:53.760
insurance policies? Yes and no. Well, no, not really. And here's

37:53.760 --> 37:58.960
why. Okay, so the problem is that unless you're running something like Chrome or something that

37:58.960 --> 38:03.040
basically has... I mean, you really are sure you're not going to get infected with something.

38:03.040 --> 38:06.720
Even in Linux, if it executes code, there's that potential. Most people using a computer,

38:06.720 --> 38:10.960
especially coming from the Windows space, don't have any idea what they're doing. And so,

38:12.640 --> 38:16.320
as far as having the alerts and stuff is concerned, a lot of people find that comforting,

38:16.320 --> 38:20.480
even if it is a little delusional, much like UAC. It's like, oh, that makes me feel more comfortable.

38:20.480 --> 38:25.680
Even though it's completely pointless, it does offer some comfort. Sadly, yes, some companies

38:25.680 --> 38:31.600
do take advantage of that. But I do think that security in Linux for casual users,

38:31.600 --> 38:37.920
non-IT people, is terrible. And I'm going to say that again. I think if you're a non-IT person that

38:37.920 --> 38:41.760
literally just jumped over from Windows, you are going to execute everything you can get

38:41.760 --> 38:43.920
your hands on because you don't know any differently. You don't know about where

38:43.920 --> 38:48.480
the packages are coming from. And you really do need something to basically babysit you because

38:48.480 --> 38:53.840
people aren't wired for that. They're just not. IT people are, absolutely. IT people roll their

38:53.840 --> 38:57.440
eyes and think, God, you people are idiots. But the fact of the matter is, I used to deal with

38:57.440 --> 39:02.240
people like this on a daily basis. Folks aren't wired for that. So they do need the option of

39:02.240 --> 39:05.600
a babysitter. But I don't think it should necessarily be enabled by default. I think

39:05.600 --> 39:10.400
when you install a distro, that it should prompt you, are you a newbie or are you advanced? And

39:10.400 --> 39:15.200
then your experience is then catered accordingly. That's all I would say. All right, let's take it

39:15.200 --> 39:20.880
to the Hangout. Let's give Chris there with the epic beard a chance to, because he didn't have

39:20.880 --> 39:25.200
his mic working last time I went to him. Chris, is your mic working now? Oh, no, hold on. Still

39:25.200 --> 39:29.840
not. Man, two in a row. That's going to be your last chance, man. Yeah, you got to check that

39:29.840 --> 39:34.400
stuff with PulseAudio somehow. It's all right. Anybody else on the Hangout panel want to chime

39:34.400 --> 39:39.280
in? Do you think Linux needs antivirus invisible security, more visible security alerts to the user?

39:40.160 --> 39:48.320
Anybody want to? And it's a placebo. Take it, Josh. Yeah, take it. I think Clam AV has its use,

39:48.880 --> 39:54.560
not for viruses on Linux, but for scanning files that potentially have viruses that could be

39:54.560 --> 39:58.400
harmful to Windows, because that still could island hop over to your Windows machines,

39:59.280 --> 40:03.920
say if you're an office. Well, I remember we just talked about it yesterday on last.

40:04.800 --> 40:09.120
You have that malware that is not really interested in much on your Linux box other than what your

40:09.120 --> 40:14.640
web browser is doing. It cares more about what Chrome and Firefox are up to. Exactly. Can you

40:14.640 --> 40:21.680
hear me? Yeah, we hear you, Chris. Awesome. What do you think? Well, I think that if you want to

40:21.680 --> 40:27.760
have something visual to give to a new user, you can have plenty of web browser plugins,

40:27.760 --> 40:35.360
whether for Chrome or Firefox that you can throw in there, things like NoScript or Adblock Plus

40:35.360 --> 40:45.920
that can give you a visual that can keep bad things from executing within the browser. But I

40:45.920 --> 40:51.440
think that as far as a firewall or antivirus goes, you have your Clam AV and you have a couple of

40:51.440 --> 40:58.880
other options. But when it comes to the firewall, I think that's an opportunity to teach. It's an

40:58.880 --> 41:06.000
opportunity to introduce people that aren't familiar to teach them how it works and how to

41:06.000 --> 41:12.400
maintain it. Because as much as you would like to, you can't sit grandma down with any version of

41:12.400 --> 41:18.960
Linux and expect her to know how everything works and expect it to be safe. You have to

41:18.960 --> 41:26.400
carry on from there and give them the full experience and teach them. Yeah, very good

41:26.400 --> 41:33.440
points. All right. So I tend to agree and more so from the fact that I think I'm on board with you

41:33.440 --> 41:39.600
guys in regards to what users need to be comfortable and to act as an educational

41:39.600 --> 41:44.800
experience. In fact, we aren't the first people to touch on this, Matt. You remember Xandros.

41:44.800 --> 41:50.640
Oh, yeah. Actually, I did a presentation, Linux Fest 03, I believe, on Xandros, talking about

41:50.640 --> 41:56.160
the fact that, and one of the analogies I used, the screenshot you have up here giving an example,

41:56.160 --> 42:01.440
is that they understand that just because you like to eat does not mean that you like to cook.

42:01.440 --> 42:04.400
They understand that just because you like to have your oil changed does not mean that you

42:04.400 --> 42:08.000
want to sit there in the driveway with your monkey suit on and get under the car. I'm one of those

42:08.000 --> 42:14.160
guys. I'm like six flavors lazy. There's no way I have any interest in doing any of that. And I

42:14.160 --> 42:20.880
would pose the same thing to a computer. So a lot of IT people have this belief that, well,

42:20.880 --> 42:25.520
they just need to learn. Really, what are the things that you pay to have someone do for you

42:25.520 --> 42:30.960
that you're not interested in learning? Translate that. That's the point of it. It's a lot of people

42:30.960 --> 42:36.880
are willing and happy to pay for software or other tools to do that for them. Stepping outside of that

42:36.880 --> 42:41.760
bubble for a minute, I would say this is an opportunity to start promoting boxes that sit

42:41.760 --> 42:46.000
outside of the computer attached to your router that would then run this stuff for you. So that

42:46.000 --> 42:50.080
it is out of the box easy. They don't have to worry about it and it's secure. So that's another

42:50.080 --> 42:54.640
option as well. But no, people don't want to learn this stuff. I can't tell you how many times that

42:54.640 --> 43:01.200
I hear that and it's just like, it's a novelty thought. I think even young people know how to

43:01.200 --> 43:04.800
run smartphones. They know how to run Angry Birds. They know how to play games. They don't give a

43:04.800 --> 43:10.160
flying crap about a lot of this stuff unless they are in fact geeks or they are in fact interested

43:10.160 --> 43:16.800
in this stuff. A lot of them aren't though. You'd be surprised. Good point. Sad, but it's true.

43:18.240 --> 43:22.640
Actually, to us it seems foreign and strange, but these people have other things in their lives that

43:22.640 --> 43:27.600
they're more interested in and I can't hold that against them. I deal with them every day and some

43:27.600 --> 43:33.040
of these people are really smart individuals. That's how a lot of us make money is by dealing

43:33.040 --> 43:43.600
with these people. And it is wasteful and it is silly, but it's true. I worry about

43:44.240 --> 43:47.920
future generations not learning. But look, here's something else that I worry about and our next

43:47.920 --> 43:52.800
sponsor is going to help you solve a problem that is becoming more and more of a concern for a lot

43:52.800 --> 43:57.920
of us with a lot of the recent NSA revelations going on. ProXPN. Go to ProXPN.com. You know what

43:57.920 --> 44:04.320
they are? They are what I think is becoming one of the up and coming premier VPN solution providers.

44:04.320 --> 44:09.280
They got all types of VPNs, great VPNs, and they also use open VPN, which obviously I'm a huge fan

44:09.280 --> 44:13.840
of. So if you haven't thought about why you might want a VPN, obviously the first is to kind of

44:13.840 --> 44:18.720
protect your identity online. And the other would be to keep what you're doing private. Even though

44:18.720 --> 44:23.520
you might be VPNing to somewhere else, it might eventually get monitored. It's at least one step

44:23.520 --> 44:27.440
removed. But the other thing you can use it for is to put yourself physically in another location.

44:27.440 --> 44:32.880
So maybe if you need to be over across the pond, either side of that pond, ProXPN can help you do

44:32.880 --> 44:38.480
that. And we've got a great deal for ProXPN. When you go to ProXPN.com and you decide to buy,

44:38.480 --> 44:43.920
you can take 20% off the lifetime of your purchase. And I think their base rate is only like

44:43.920 --> 44:49.680
seven bucks a month. It's super crazy cheap. Yeah. And with ProXPN, you're going to get unlimited

44:49.680 --> 44:53.440
anonymous IP addresses. You can have PPT connectivity. You can have open VPN connectivity.

44:53.440 --> 44:58.640
They've got support for mobile devices. They've got customer support, unlimited data transfer,

44:58.640 --> 45:02.400
great speeds. I've been playing with it. I'm pretty dang impressed. And they also have a

45:02.400 --> 45:05.920
nice control panel. And you can just set this right up in network manager and then connect

45:05.920 --> 45:10.880
from your Linux box. It's really, really sweet. So go to ProXPN.com. Use the code JBLIVE when you

45:10.880 --> 45:16.320
check out. JBLIVE will get you 20% off of that plan for like ever. And they have a really good Linux

45:16.320 --> 45:20.080
tutorial actually for folks that are coming to it from the Linux desktop. It's worth checking out.

45:20.080 --> 45:24.800
They've got server locations in Singapore, London, Seattle, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York,

45:24.800 --> 45:34.400
and Amsterdam. And they have 512-bit encrypted tunnels. And their encryption key is a 2048-bit

45:34.400 --> 45:39.280
encryption key. So pretty good stuff. Go to ProXPN.com and use the code JBLIVE when you

45:39.280 --> 45:44.640
check out to get 20% for life. We've had a lot of people asking us about VPNs. And that's how

45:44.640 --> 45:47.360
I would do it. So I thought, hey, if this is how I'm going to do it, these guys should be a sponsor.

45:47.360 --> 45:51.840
That's right. Andre writes, and he says, on OMG Ubuntu, there's an article about the

45:52.480 --> 45:57.200
Android lock screen getting an official, quote unquote, not official at all,

45:58.880 --> 46:02.640
Ubuntu touch lock screen where you can replace the lock screen on your Android device with the

46:02.640 --> 46:07.520
Ubuntu touch. And of course, this is stirring up some controversy. It was done by a developer

46:07.520 --> 46:13.280
over on the XDA forums. And I'm looking at a picture of it right now. And it looks like all

46:13.280 --> 46:18.720
the promo images you've seen of Ubuntu touch running on Android, that clock with the dots

46:18.720 --> 46:27.040
going around. Right. Yeah. And so he's asking, what do we think about this kind of thing? Is this

46:27.040 --> 46:34.240
hurting canonical? Is this evil to rip off a Linux company like this? Or is this just part of the way

46:34.240 --> 46:39.200
the web works now? I think it remains to be seen. I really do. I'm still kind of on the fence about

46:39.200 --> 46:43.840
it. Lately, the company as a whole has me just scratching my head as to what they're thinking.

46:44.480 --> 46:47.840
Well, no, this isn't canonical. They did the port. Some other guys took it and said,

46:47.840 --> 46:51.680
I like the look of it. I'm going to make a port of it and kind of rip off their branding a little

46:51.680 --> 46:55.920
bit. Oh, that's naughty. No, that's not good. That's not good at all. That's not all right.

46:55.920 --> 47:00.000
Nope. That's kind of where I fell down too. I mean, I like it. I'm not going to lie.

47:00.720 --> 47:02.080
I did have it on my Nexus 7.

47:02.080 --> 47:07.760
Oh, nice. Hey, you know, you got to try it.

47:07.760 --> 47:10.160
But that's just because I'm just waiting for Ubuntu Touch to finish.

47:11.120 --> 47:14.160
Deval writes and he says, hello, Chris and Matt. I've been listening to the show for a while now.

47:14.160 --> 47:16.560
I've grown to be quite a fan of it. I would just like to say thank you for

47:16.560 --> 47:20.640
providing such a great, amazing content day after week and week after week. I don't know

47:20.640 --> 47:25.120
how you do it, to be honest. Well, thanks, Deval. I do it by not pronouncing names correctly. I

47:25.120 --> 47:29.680
don't spend any time. Yeah. I would like to add that my dad finally runs Linux thanks to you

47:29.680 --> 47:37.520
guys. His ancient 1GB of RAM, 1.6GHz Core 2 Duo finally got messed up enough that he couldn't

47:37.520 --> 47:41.520
connect to the internet anymore. So he finally agreed to let me put Linux on it. Now I have an

47:41.520 --> 47:46.000
option as the choice of distro. But since this is my dad and it was an old laptop, I decided to

47:46.000 --> 47:50.640
give Linux Mint 15 a try thanks to your review of it on the show. And it looks gorgeous. It looks

47:50.640 --> 47:55.200
absolutely spectacular and my father was completely blown away by it. Now I don't have to worry about

47:55.200 --> 48:00.080
him installing some malware toolbar.exe or anything like that on his machine. But wait,

48:00.080 --> 48:04.080
there's more. My sister came to me with a strange request the same day wanting to extract a couple

48:04.080 --> 48:07.920
of clips from a video. At first I didn't think I had any choice and I thought I'd have to use

48:07.920 --> 48:12.240
Windows Movie Maker. Then I remembered you guys talking about OpenShot. I quickly downloaded

48:12.240 --> 48:18.160
onto my sister's laptop, extracted the clips she needed through X11VNC because she asked me to do

48:18.160 --> 48:22.080
it on her computer and I wasn't there. Thank you guys enough for introducing me to OpenShot and

48:22.080 --> 48:26.480
more. Keep up the great show and congratulations on the baby, Chris. That's awesome. Yeah, you know,

48:26.480 --> 48:30.320
and throw some Splashtop on that and you can do it from the comfort of your own home. Yeah, now

48:30.320 --> 48:35.280
that's, you know, Splashtop might be fast enough you could actually video edit. Oh, you could. I've

48:35.280 --> 48:39.360
actually done it. Yeah, you totally can. Yeah, I linked in the show notes there was an article

48:39.360 --> 48:43.760
that Ferronix ran that was like they did some sort of test and they were saying like Splashtop

48:43.760 --> 48:47.760
in some cases was, I don't know how this is possible. Actually, now that I think about it.

48:47.760 --> 48:53.360
But I think it was saying 10 times faster than VNC. Based on my experiences, I can't assign a

48:53.360 --> 48:59.040
numeric value to it, but it is, it was painfully faster than VNC. I won't assign numbers to it,

48:59.040 --> 49:03.440
but it was VNC and then going back to VNC or even TeamViewer or any of the others. It was,

49:03.440 --> 49:07.760
it was, there was definitely a difference, but VNC just, it's horrible to use VNC after using

49:07.760 --> 49:12.160
Splashtop. It's just horrible. I don't know. I feel dirty. I don't know. Hey Matt,

49:12.160 --> 49:20.080
do you have any experience with BT Guard? Isn't that for Guard? No. Yeah. That's not a VPN

49:20.080 --> 49:25.680
solution. Isn't that for just making sure you don't VPN from the wrong... Something that worked

49:25.680 --> 49:30.640
really well for about a year. No, it's not something that is really considered to be a

49:30.640 --> 49:34.320
secure. It's a little bit kind of the, they're dealing with some of the, yeah, I would avoid it

49:34.320 --> 49:38.000
personally. I haven't had good experiences that I've heard about it, but I've not used it personally,

49:38.000 --> 49:44.320
so I can't speak, but yeah, I wouldn't. Google around about BT Guard problems, BT Guard security,

49:44.320 --> 49:48.960
and then come to your own conclusion. So hang out. I want to toss to you guys real quick. Anybody in

49:48.960 --> 49:52.720
there play with Splashtop or any other remote desktop solutions that you think are worth

49:52.720 --> 49:57.040
people checking out? Anybody had any experience with those? No. Everybody's shaking their head.

49:57.040 --> 50:02.000
No. Well, all right. Let's check that out. Yeah. Yeah. I thought Splashtop was pretty great. Oh,

50:02.000 --> 50:06.000
you'll, yeah. It'll change the way you use your computer. You will literally like all the stuff

50:06.000 --> 50:10.080
that you need to have your, just, you know, when you're doing just like mild mouse access for that,

50:10.080 --> 50:13.440
you have to come upstairs to do or go to another room to do. You'll be doing this from your

50:13.440 --> 50:18.480
recliner from now on. I'm telling you. Absolutely. And yes, TeamViewer is also a really good one,

50:18.480 --> 50:23.040
but I found that the performance is a wee bit better with the Splashtop. So. All right. Garrett

50:23.040 --> 50:26.160
writes in, he says, hi Chris and Matt, long veer of the show. I try to catch it every episode.

50:26.160 --> 50:31.760
Congrats on the new kid. I've heard you say you do all your editing on the Bonobo. I would hope

50:31.760 --> 50:35.360
that means under Linux, he says. If it is, what programs do you use for editing? I've been unable

50:35.360 --> 50:39.200
to find many good programs for video editing under Linux. So Gary, you have some back episodes to go

50:39.200 --> 50:45.440
catch up on my friend. I do the, I could edit audio on the Bonobo. I can do the soundboard

50:45.440 --> 50:52.800
from the Bonobo. So like if, if we were sitting around here and all of a sudden, I decided like,

50:52.800 --> 50:57.360
oh crap, you know, I, hey, I think that's Anderson Cooper. Oh my gosh. It's Anderson Cooper,

50:57.360 --> 51:02.720
everybody. Something like that is driven from a Linux box right now in the studio,

51:02.720 --> 51:07.600
but the video editing is happening on, on the final cut on the, on the Apple's final cut.

51:07.600 --> 51:13.840
I was thinking though, possibly about this show might be our first regular show that I edit fully

51:14.800 --> 51:20.640
under the GNU slash Linux. Wow. I don't know. I mean, open shot, I guess would probably be the

51:20.640 --> 51:26.560
way to go. Yes. I'd say open shots. Good. Although Katie, it depends on what you're really doing as

51:26.560 --> 51:31.120
far as transitions and stuff. Yes. I'm going to say open shot probably is an option, but you might

51:31.120 --> 51:36.640
want to try the Katie in live. Go that route for especially running a Katie. Whoa, Fox news alert.

51:40.720 --> 51:45.120
That comes in with Katie in live. That was for the chat room. All right, Chris. This one comes

51:45.120 --> 51:49.440
from Cody. Hi there, Chris and Matt. Great show. Been watching since shortly before Brian left and

51:49.440 --> 51:53.840
boy has it gotten good. Anyway, I was wondering if I could get your input on something. I have a

51:53.840 --> 51:58.960
Raspberry Pi set up in my house as a combined NAS and deal in a media server with one terabyte of

51:58.960 --> 52:10.480
external hard drive attached via USB. I'm looking to restrict the NAS port only I had to select.

52:10.480 --> 52:15.280
Other few people could access it from windows and access it at the same time as I'm the only

52:15.280 --> 52:20.000
Linux user in the house. So which is easier to set up a kind of Raspbian ITS or some boy,

52:20.000 --> 52:23.520
this is getting clunky. But what I think he's saying is he wants to set up a NAS server and

52:23.520 --> 52:31.520
only give certain people access. And he says congrats on the baby. So C Smith, Cody, here's

52:31.520 --> 52:36.480
what I would say. Yeah, so he asked if Samba would be the right way to go. If you've got Raspbian

52:36.480 --> 52:40.080
already loaded on your Raspberry Pi, then you can start Samba and then there is a command called

52:40.080 --> 52:46.880
SMB password and you do SMB password dash E and then the Linux user that you want to have access

52:46.880 --> 52:51.040
and you could just enable just those users. So you could enable your account and your buddy's

52:51.040 --> 52:55.920
account, but not the other people's account in your house, right? Good stuff. Lazarus asked

52:55.920 --> 53:01.920
whatever happened to Lightworks. First of all, I can't get it running on Arch. Yeah, it's still

53:01.920 --> 53:08.080
so long out and I, you know, honestly I'm holding out for what OpenShot plans on doing over time.

53:08.080 --> 53:12.240
I think that's probably in the long stretch is probably where it's going to come out winning.

53:13.600 --> 53:18.000
Although Kdenlive has been kind of my go-to thing here lately, just because it does have more,

53:18.000 --> 53:22.960
it has additional functions that are useful to me. Oh yeah. But, you know, but OpenShot's really

53:22.960 --> 53:26.480
cool if you want the blender functionality, things like that. But I think long-term,

53:26.480 --> 53:30.400
I think OpenShot will be the winner as they begin plugging in all the work that he's been

53:30.400 --> 53:33.360
putting into it. Yeah, man, that's what I was thinking. It's like, might as well get on board

53:33.360 --> 53:38.720
with that now. Although I'll be honest, the one advantage that Lightworks, and I don't know if

53:38.720 --> 53:44.800
OpenShot does this, it depends on if it just uses FFmpeg, but I record stuff in that crazy ass ProRes

53:44.800 --> 53:49.520
format. We'll see. And all this stuff is, and maybe this too, I'm not sure about that specifically,

53:49.520 --> 53:54.400
but all this stuff, he's completely retooling OpenShot. I mean, like totally from the ground

53:54.400 --> 53:58.640
up, everything's different. And so as that becomes to come about, he's trying to make it more pro

53:58.640 --> 54:02.800
level. I think I'm trying to find his Kickstarter page right now, but I don't see, I think I remember

54:02.800 --> 54:07.760
him saying- He just did an update on his Facebook page. I don't know if it's, he's sending out all

54:07.760 --> 54:12.080
the goodies now. I think I remember they are working on that. So that would be interesting.

54:12.080 --> 54:17.120
All right. So we got, I think this will be our last email. There's still, let's see, if I tab

54:17.120 --> 54:22.320
over to the Linux box, how do I, how do you, Thunderbird doesn't, oh yeah, here we go. There's

54:22.320 --> 54:29.200
still 189 unread emails. And that didn't even open up BitMessage. I've been replying to BitMessages

54:29.200 --> 54:36.080
this morning. In fact, speaking of that, that fits in well with our next email from Sam. He says,

54:36.080 --> 54:40.160
hi, Chris and Matt. In one of your shows, Chris said that he doesn't watch much television anymore.

54:40.160 --> 54:43.920
Instead, he subscribes to podcasts. I like the idea since I don't watch television either. So I

54:43.920 --> 54:47.360
started looking for interesting podcasts, not necessarily Linux specific, but I really didn't

54:47.360 --> 54:52.160
find anything worth listening to. So would Chris mind sharing a list of the podcasts with us?

54:53.440 --> 54:58.320
That's a great idea. This floats around a lot for me because I browse around to see what other folks

54:58.320 --> 55:04.320
have up their sleeves. But that's where, so I'll start with one podcast that I listen to every,

55:04.320 --> 55:11.040
every Sunday after Lass. After Lass is done, after it's published, after I've put the family to bed,

55:11.840 --> 55:18.080
I break out a beer and I listen to a little No Agenda with Adam Curry and John C. Dvorak. And

55:18.080 --> 55:22.560
they, Adam Curry, was experimenting with BitMessage this morning. So I've been corresponding with Adam

55:22.560 --> 55:28.080
Curry this morning over BitMessage, which was fun. And he's, you know, he's got an interest in it. And

55:28.080 --> 55:32.560
so it was, it's cool to work with people as they try out BitMessage for the first time. So No Agenda

55:32.560 --> 55:36.400
is on my list of one of my regulars. And another podcast that I listen to every single week,

55:36.400 --> 55:42.080
otherwise I just jump around a lot, is Mission Log, a Roddenberry Star Trek podcast, where they're

55:42.080 --> 55:46.560
going in chronological air date of the Star Trek shows, starting with the original series, working

55:46.560 --> 55:52.960
all the way up to the end of Enterprise. And they just did an episode 53, The Ultimate Computer,

55:52.960 --> 55:59.600
where M5... Oh yes, I remember that. Yeah. M5 comes on board and they plug in M5 and he takes

55:59.600 --> 56:06.720
over the Enterprise and then the chaos ensues. So I really enjoy that podcast. So that's one I listen

56:06.720 --> 56:12.960
to regularly, but I really, those, there's another one I listen to on occasion this week in Trek. You

56:12.960 --> 56:16.240
can tell I'm kind of been in a Star Trek kick lately. I'll also occasionally listen to This

56:16.240 --> 56:22.000
American Life and Radio Lab, but not too often. And then otherwise I just kind of shop. What about

56:22.000 --> 56:25.360
you, Matt? Do you have any podcasts you listen to on a regular basis? I'm not really so much anymore.

56:25.360 --> 56:31.520
I used to listen to a lot of the, some of the Twitter network stuff, you know, off and on.

56:31.520 --> 56:36.960
Oh yeah. Yeah. I'll tune into their live stream sometimes. Sure. I'm a buddy of Lamar Wilson. So

56:36.960 --> 56:41.840
I of course listened to all his stuff and we're actually rather view it. And so I watched that.

56:41.840 --> 56:47.520
That's really, you know, I don't watch as many podcasts as I used to. I'm just, you know,

56:47.520 --> 56:51.280
so caught up in my usual day-to-day stuff. So I'm either out doing something or I'm, or I'm

56:51.280 --> 56:57.760
watching. I understand you got the Netflix plague. Yeah. I got the, I got Plex. What do you want?

56:58.400 --> 57:03.840
I know, right? How great has Plex been? Plex has really been awesome. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I've

57:03.840 --> 57:09.280
been, I've been catching a lot of pretty, some, some pretty good shows. I think out of all of

57:09.280 --> 57:13.040
the sort of, you know, a lot of the stuff we do in these segments are like, Chris is solving a

57:13.040 --> 57:16.400
problem in his house and now he's going to talk about it. Or Chris solved a problem for a client.

57:16.400 --> 57:20.560
Now he's going to, I mean, that's honestly where like a lot of the topics come from. True. And

57:20.560 --> 57:27.680
Plex was like, oh man, I want to just like, I just want to do a whole Plex show. I love Plex so much

57:27.680 --> 57:33.680
these days. I've even, I even got, I even signed up and bought a lifetime membership of my Plex.

57:33.680 --> 57:36.400
And I originally, when I said, I was like, yeah, I'm not going to buy that. I'm just going to use

57:36.400 --> 57:43.200
the freebie. But then, you know, I was out, I had the HTC one has fantastic freaking speakers on it.

57:43.200 --> 57:47.040
And I was like, gosh, you know, we're going to Costco. We're going to be sitting in the truck

57:47.040 --> 57:51.440
while we wait for something to get delivered. I've got 30 minutes to kill with my kids to do

57:51.440 --> 57:56.480
my Plex pulled up one of their favorite little shows and you know, perfectly viewable, perfectly

57:56.480 --> 58:00.320
watchable from the HTC one right there while we're sitting in the Costco parking lot. Oh, that's

58:00.320 --> 58:04.640
awesome. Yeah. And you know, I sure I could do that from Netflix, but this is my collection.

58:05.280 --> 58:10.080
Exactly. Cause I mean that I'm in the same boat and, and that's exactly what I do. I mean, I have

58:10.080 --> 58:13.680
a lot of stuff on Voodoo that, you know, basically the, where you buy a DVD or Blu-ray and it comes

58:13.680 --> 58:17.680
with a little slip and you put it on the, you know, put it on your Voodoo set up. I've got

58:17.680 --> 58:21.520
that. I got the Netflix, I got the Hulu, but yeah, I find myself using Plex more and more simply

58:21.520 --> 58:26.320
because it's DVDs and Blu-rays that I've backed up. So this is content that I'm excited about

58:26.320 --> 58:30.160
and not Netflix. Yeah, exactly. And the quality is a little better.

58:30.160 --> 58:32.960
Way better. And the other thing that has happened to me, I've been bitten by is,

58:34.000 --> 58:38.160
is that age old problem where a doesn't work under Linux natively and

58:38.160 --> 58:44.160
they, they pull content off of there from time to time and then you're kind of left off. Oh, shoot.

58:44.800 --> 58:48.640
Shoot. Crap. Crap. There's one more topic I want to talk about before we go. I shouldn't have waited

58:48.640 --> 58:53.680
this long, Matt. Oh, dang it. So you and I asked during the live stream last week, let's just ask

58:53.680 --> 58:59.600
the Hangout panel right now. Just curious, anybody on the Hangout, just say I, if you are considering

58:59.600 --> 59:09.440
rolling your own mail server. Oh yes. All right. Got one, two. All right. There's two. And so two,

59:09.440 --> 59:14.400
two out of the, out of the group of you, I don't have any, what is it? Eight people on top of five

59:14.400 --> 59:19.600
people. So when we asked in the IRC chat room, look at all these I's in the IRC right now, right?

59:19.600 --> 59:24.480
Look at all these. Oh yeah. Look at all these. So when we asked last week, because last week,

59:24.480 --> 59:31.840
lava bit shut down. Tor mail was shut down. Secure circle shut down. Okay. In like a two week time

59:31.840 --> 59:37.440
span, the private email industry, all the top dogs have just basically left the market.

59:38.640 --> 59:45.120
And I got to thinking about the fact that when you're on a Google mail, a Hotmail, whatever it is,

59:46.160 --> 59:51.600
you have no idea who's asking for what, when it gets, when it happens. Exactly. You don't know if

59:51.600 --> 59:55.520
you get swept up in some sort of mass surveillance, like what happens with the Verizon and other telco

59:55.520 --> 01:00:02.400
phone metadata monitoring. And if you host your own email server in your house or on your own

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:09.200
private locked up VPS, at least they have to come to you and they have to say, we want access to

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:13.120
your email, Mr. Fisher. And they have to serve me a warrant. And it no longer becomes a convenience

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:16.160
for them, really. It's right. It's not something where eventually the companies are going to

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:20.320
build in these automated extraction processes to save them time and money. It's not something

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:25.520
where they can just put a tap right in front of my house and monitor. Yeah, well, maybe. And it's

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:29.840
one of these things where at least I would have some sort of visibility, even if I can't prevent

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:35.440
it from happening. Even if there's no legal recourse, I at least am aware of when it happens.

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:41.440
And so these things got me thinking. And so I set up a mail server using some open source software

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:45.680
from my grandparents recently. It was from part of my grandpa's birthday. I got him a dot com using

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:54.000
our last 249 code. And then I, or Linux 249. And then I forwarded that to their own personal

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.760
mail server that I pre-set up for them on that Nexus 7. So they just push the little mail button

01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:03.040
on the Nexus 7 and it launches into their private mail account. And because they were on MSN for

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:07.680
years, since MSN was a dial up service back in the day when it competed with AOL, I said, okay,

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:11.600
grandma and grandpa, let's get you off MSN. Let's get you on, you know, and we have a good in family

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:16.880
joke URL that we use that everybody thought was really great and had a good laugh at. And I set

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:20.480
all this up and I thought, yeah, maybe I should do this for myself. I'm getting emails from people

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:23.840
outside the United States all the time. Who knows what the hell they want to talk to me about? Who

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:27.280
knows what the hell is going to be in that email? Who knows what list they might be on when I'm

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:32.720
responding back to them? And so I've been thinking about this a little bit, but I don't like the idea

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:38.400
of having a mail server in my house. It's a pain in the ass. Oh yeah. It doesn't, it doesn't,

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:42.160
at least at first pass, it doesn't seem very practical. I mean, when you first think about it.

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:46.720
Here's what I think. Here's what, here's the sort of like thing that nods at me is it's one of those

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:51.680
things where it's hard to quantify a reason to do it today fully. Oh yeah, man, maybe the NSA is

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:56.080
going to monitor my shit, but I don't care. I'm not saying anything. I don't care. It's not like

01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:01.120
I'm all that important. But the reality to me seems like, so there was this, now we're getting

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:05.840
down to the conspiracy range, but there was this story that ran this week that the NSA plans to

01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:12.000
reduce their system administration staff by 90% and automate the majority of the task automation.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000
That seems obvious. Of course that's going to happen, right? And so, so they do this task

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.360
automation. They're going to, they're going to automate all of this data analysis. And pretty

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:22.960
soon it's just going to be computers looking at this stuff, indexing, storing information. And

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:27.600
it's going to be every now and then a one's going to go in this database for so Matt likes cats.

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:31.600
Let's put a one in that, put a, put a one in that field. All right. Matt likes burgers, put a one in

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:36.480
that field. And over 20 years, they're going to have all of this information about you that you

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:41.760
have no say in opting out of that system. And you get all of the, you're going to have all of these

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:44.720
weird things that will happen. You'll have profiling that happens. You'll have analysis that

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:49.360
happens. You'll have assumptions that are made based on you contributing 20, 30, whatever it's

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:54.320
going to be years, 10 years of information into the system. And at that point, when that arrives,

01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:58.560
you'll look back and go, well, shit, maybe I should have done something about that back early

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:02.080
when I found out about this shit was going on. I knew it was a bad idea all along. I knew this

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:07.280
was going to happen, but I never did anything. And now it's too late. And to quantify this and

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:10.480
for people that are thinking, oh my gosh, this sounds like unfiltered stuff. Cause I understand

01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:15.040
that at first pass it does. Let me put this into something we all experience junk mail,

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:21.840
mailing lists and catalogs for really weird stuff. Okay. This is an example of being thrown into that

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:27.200
kind of bucket on a very platonic, casual scale. Don't try to appease them. If people don't like

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:30.320
that, don't try to appease the people that say this unfiltered stuff are just morons that aren't

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:34.640
appreciating the situation that we're in. And you know what I'm trying to help people process.

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:41.440
Open source Linux software is here to help us with all of this. Let's not, let's not hide from it.

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:45.280
Let's embrace the fact that this is a new calling for open source software. This is a new

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:49.920
need that open source software can solve. And I think we should embrace that fact.

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:54.480
I think it's worth celebrating that aspect of it, that thankfully we've all been sitting here,

01:03:54.480 --> 01:04:00.320
champion, a platform and a methodology and a theology that in the long run is going to protect

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:03.840
us from an oppressive government, at least at the technological level. And I don't think we

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:08.960
should shy away from that. I don't, it's stupid. It, it, it's, it demeans. It's, it's reductive

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:13.760
of the overall issue to say, no, that's unfiltered related that come on, screw those guys.

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:17.200
Well, I'm not even trying to appease them. A lot of times when people feel that way,

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:22.160
it's a defensive mechanism because we're taught to not question things. We want to get,

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:26.080
we want to get more people to, to, you know, actually rationally think about things.

01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:29.280
It's not about appeasing them. It's helping them to see something in a new way.

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:29.920
Yeah.

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:32.560
You know, maybe it's like someone trying Linux for the first time. Well,

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:35.120
I've heard that stupid because I heard it was this and I heard it with that,

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:38.240
but by getting them to actually quantify it and something they can relate to, it's like,

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:42.320
Oh, well, okay. Well, that makes sense to me. So by using that catalog example, that is an example

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:47.520
of how that has happened. Back over factually, it will happen. You will end up in a list that you

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:52.400
don't want to be on. That's, that's reality. When you, when this, all this service harvesting garbage

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:56.400
goes on, it will happen. Next thing you know, you're going to be on a list for, I like to,

01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:02.320
you know, explode cats or something because you looked up, you know, you have explosive diarrhea

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:06.160
on one. And you have, and you love cats on the other and that gets intermixed. Things happen.

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:13.360
There was something I was looking for just last week for unfiltered. And I, I, I, I opened up the

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:17.440
tab and of course, you know, in Chrome, you just start, you just start typing and it starts Google.

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:22.960
And I started typing out, I said, this is a DuckDuckGo search. And it was like, I don't know,

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:25.920
I don't remember what it was, but it was like one of those things where I was like, I don't really

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:32.080
want to log this. You know, what's funny to show you why the system and there's, so if you remove

01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:37.200
all conspiracy from it, you're just going to have a system that just doesn't work anyways.

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:41.520
I'll give you an example right now. If I pull out my HTC one and I look at my Google now screen,

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:49.200
now Google now is giving me driving directions to the nearest Walmart. I don't go to Walmart,

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:55.760
but during Coder radio today, Michael said the phrase Walmartification. And I Google searched,

01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:00.320
I Google search to Walmartification just to get the spelling of it. Cause I wanted,

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:05.280
I thought it'd be a great title suggestion because I Google searched Walmartification.

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:09.920
Apparently Google now thinks I'm a Walmart shopper and is preventing me or is presenting me a Google

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:15.040
now card with driving directions to the nearest Walmart. And this is just, I don't want to be in

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:20.640
the system as a Walmart user. I forget the video. There was a really awesome video that talked

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:24.240
about the danger of Google having some of the power that it does. And it was a guy that was

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:28.160
calling up to check on the status of something he'd ordered. And it was, I think it was like a

01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:30.880
new pair of pants or something. He's like, well, according to our records, you know,

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:34.080
you've been to the doctor recently because of your blood pressure and oh, your weight's kind

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:37.120
of going up there. We need to look into that. Oh no, he's ordering a pizza. That's what it was.

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:41.040
He was ordering a pizza and it went through his medical history and all this other stuff because

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:45.360
it was just readily available. You know, that kind of environment, that kind of world isn't

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:50.080
really that unlikely to be that far off. And it's kind of scary. That's not tinfoil hat stuff.

01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:54.640
Stuff we deal with now 10, 15 years ago, hell 20 years ago was totally tinfoil.

01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:57.920
Here we are, you know, so that's kind of how I see it.

01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:01.680
I would leave you with this final thought too, is like, if you like the ability of running your

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:05.680
own email server, if you like the idea of having your own file server, if you like that, then it

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:09.520
is worth being a user of that just to encourage those developers to continue on.

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:13.600
That's a cool skill to learn. It's cool. And it's kind of neat to be able to set it up for people,

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:18.080
you know? Yeah. Yeah. You know, I mean, so I think I might, I think I might cover how I set

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:21.120
up that mail system for them because I used a really cool open source package that I think

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:24.320
a lot of people could use to get going. I did it like it, I did it in an afternoon.

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:30.160
Yeah. So I think it worked out pretty well. So I, this is a point of, this is maybe a topic I'd

01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:34.240
like to get more feedback from you guys out there on is how you've rolled your own mail service. So

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:38.720
email us linuxactionshow at jupiterbroadcasting.com. Of course, love to hear all of your feedback out

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:44.160
there. You can join us Monday afternoons for Linux Action Show Unplugged. And I think also,

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:49.120
this is a long shot. If anybody out there has a Mumble server and like to help us get that up and

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:52.400
run it, I don't know anything about Mumble really. I mean, I know what Mumble is, but I've never set

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:57.360
up a Mumble server. I don't really want to. I don't know if I want to use a Mumble host or which

01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:00.160
one's good. So if you have an experience out there, if you run a Mumble server and want to

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:06.720
help the community out, get in touch with us, just email me or the show, chris at jupiterbroadcasting.com

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:12.400
and linuxactionshow at jupiterbroadcasting.com. I wanted to give a special plug. I'll put the link

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:18.000
in the chat room right now. Professor Messer? Professor Messer. I think is how you say his

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:23.520
last name. It's a YouTube channel. Yeah. I know. And it's one I stumbled across this weekend when

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:28.960
prepping for last. And I thought I'd just give people, it's, he's got, he just uploaded a couple

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:37.440
of CompTIA Linux Plus tutorials. Linux Plus common bootloader commands, Linux device drivers, Linux

01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:43.200
hardware resources. He's got, he's got like, it's, it's for getting your CompTIA Linux Plus exam.

01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:52.160
And he's got videos that go through those, those sections of the LX, LX 101 and LX 101 Li, LPIC 1

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:56.000
and 1.1. It's, anyways, if you, if you're looking at the Linux Plus exams or you're curious about

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.480
the material they cover, his YouTube channel not only has those, but lots of other good stuff in

01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:05.120
there. He's got A plus hardware information in there. He's got network plus video groups in

01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:11.200
there and study group sessions in there. I think he is a, a college professor himself or some,

01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:14.720
somebody in that degree who covers this stuff. And I thought it was just an interesting resource.

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:17.840
And it's as current as if two days ago with some of this stuff. So I'll put a link to that in the

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:25.360
show notes. Professor Messer is the M E S Professor M E S S E R is the channel on YouTube. It might

01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:29.520
be a little good extra reading if you guys are looking for something afterwards. Hang out guys.

01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:34.880
Thanks for joining us. Anybody want anything to touch on before we go? Last chance. Hang out.

01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:38.160
I'm done. All right, Don. Well, thanks for joining us. It was good to see you.

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:44.080
I'll see you again. All right. Very good. Chris, wonderful beard and Josh. Thanks for chatting with

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:47.600
us guys. It was good to see from you and everybody else who didn't speak up. Thanks for joining us.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:53.280
You guys, you're a good panel. I'm going to hang up on you guys now. There you go. All right, Matt.

01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:57.120
Well, I think that'll wrap up the first episode of last unplugged. Still in, still in beta. We'll

01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:02.080
be working out the format. So of course really any, any, any input you guys have and things you

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:06.880
want to see from the show, just let us know where, where it's very early in the massaging process.

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:10.960
Lots of, lots of possibilities still. And we'd love to get more of your input, especially

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:14.800
as we get like to a mumble server or something like that. You guys can join us regularly and

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:17.760
hang out in there and talk with us. So I think that'll be a lot of fun. Don't forget. We want

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:23.200
your feedback. Linux action show at Jupiter broadcasting.com. Or if you use that contact

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:27.360
link at the top of our site, just for you guys, just for this show. Well, really everybody gets

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:32.640
it now, but I did it because of the show. I added the subject line, huh? Subject line, Matt. How

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:36.960
about that? I like it. I like the format. I think it's going to work out really well. Absolutely.

01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:40.400
All right, everyone. Thanks so much. We'll see you on Sunday for the big show. See you back here

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:51.680

Bye.
