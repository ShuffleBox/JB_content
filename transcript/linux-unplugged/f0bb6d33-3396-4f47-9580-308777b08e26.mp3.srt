1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Did you guys all see the Enlightenment OS's post about the importance of our brand?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Did everybody catch this blog post?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I told them about it.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Okay. All right. So here we go.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This is Elementary OS, and they put forth sort of a,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Hey community, this is how we'd like you to represent us.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Could you stop doing knockoff screenshots and then posting them online and saying it's called EOS.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
By the way, don't call it EOS. We will never call it EOS.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Don't make EMusic. Don't make EWeb.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That sounds stupid. We don't want that.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So don't call it EOS. Don't make EApps.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And please stop ripping off like OS X because we're worried Apple's going to send us a cease and desist if you guys keep it up.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So they kind of go on and talk about how important brands are.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And I actually agree with a lot of what they talk about with brands.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I think this is one of the advantages the Elementary OS project has is they get this.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
However, it's also, it's essentially a blog post telling people what they are allowed and not allowed to say about free software.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And as you might have guessed, where the neckbeards hang out, there has been much, much angst.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Popey, you said you trolled them. What was your take on it?

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Oh, no. It was just one of the guys, Sam, who does some of the icons and does the new mixing, I think.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
He posted a screenshot and said, you know, and tweaked it and said, this is my screenshot of Elementary.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And didn't say it was Elementary OS. And I asked him if it was EOS.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Oh, no.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And Daniel turns up and he's like, yeah, very funny guys.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So how do you guys feel about it?

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
How do you feel about a Linux distribution coming out and saying, hey, this is how we'd like you to refer to us or hey, we don't want you to refer to us this way?

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I think it's fine for them to do that internally. If that's for their staff and their direct developers and their direct community members, fine.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But to tell users to do that is a bit of a dick move.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Oh, it's the same thing with Maté or Qt.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
No, it's not. It's branding. It's just they're asking you to do something.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Maté is a brand. And they're like, oh, don't ever call it mate.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
No, I was just having fun with that when I posted that in the subreddit. I'm sorry everyone got bent out.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
No, no, no. That's a difference. That's a pronunciation versus a...

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So here's a more of an example. Here's something that maybe would bug me.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Say somebody made a Jupyter broadcasting app for Ubuntu Touch, but they lowercase the B in broadcasting.

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That would drive me crazy, even though it's a small little thing. That just doesn't look right. That's not our branding.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That's the kind of thing they're talking about. They don't want E-music. Like you have iTunes. They don't want E-tunes, those kinds of things.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But then you're not officializing the app. So what's the problem?

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I mean, just tell them to drop the thing as well. You can. You own the brand. You can tell them to drop the name.

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Okay. Is the question, are they asking people to do this or are they telling people to do this? That's the main question.

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Well...

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
They're just asking. Who cares? They're making a request.

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Well, it's very politically worded. I mean, you could almost see maybe a few years if this kind of stance could evolve into issuing C synthesis potentially.

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
No, I don't think it's that strong.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Well, no, here's why.

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I mean, but this is the thing. I would see that kind of communique coming out on an internal mailing list at Canonical talking about Ubuntu.

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I could see that. I could see someone saying, look, if you're going to put out screenshots that are promoting the product,

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:36,000
use the default items that are in the launcher, use the default icons that are in the indicator area, use one of the default backgrounds.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
That all makes sense in your own message, right?

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And that you're talking to people who work on the product who are talking about the product.

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:51,000
But when you're telling people who are in your community who are enthusiasts who aren't necessarily contributors and you see them as posting a screenshot,

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
it makes them a contributor. Therefore, they should abide by the guidelines. I think that's wrong headed.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Well, and you know, not only that, but it's wasted effort.

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And on top of that, what you're really saying, Poppy, is if you internally message correctly and then when you discuss it,

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
when you talk about things externally and you all agree on the language and then you use that same language when you discuss things externally,

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
your community just picks up on that and rolls with it. And that's how they start referring to things.

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The problem is they use EOS a couple of times themselves back in the day.

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Right. But messages change over time. It may well be they didn't formalize their branding until recently. That's fine.

58
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And they may have had a meeting about it.

59
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And maybe a lawyer said, hey, we're a little concerned about that highly litigious fruit company that makes iPhones.

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And if you guys keep going this direction where, I mean, let's be honest, elementary OS looks a lot like Mac OS X.

61
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And if you have third party themes out there that make it look even more like Mac OS X,

62
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
and then you start having things like E-Tunes and E-Web, I would not be surprised if Apple issued a cease and desist.

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I mean, didn't it happen to pair PC or whatever it was?

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
No, there's no music.

65
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Well, yeah, I know. But you get my drift. Maybe that's what they're worried about.

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So, but here's the thing, though.

67
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Apple don't give a shit about elementary, honestly.

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Technically, they are worried about this way long before.

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Initially, as a former contributor, I should say, like two, three years ago, I was contributing to the project

70
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
and there was these talks about licensing things about the website because they wanted to protect the branding.

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yeah, yeah.

72
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
They had like licensing stuff that are weird.

73
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:40,000
They put themselves into the Google Plus walls because they didn't want people to start talking about things that are going to come out.

74
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I don't know what they are talking about.

75
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
They're punching above their weight slightly.

76
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yeah, I think that's partially it.

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I think that they are very, very, very brand conscious.

78
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Extremely, extremely brand conscious.

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And they feel like it's important to set the tone right and to keep it that way.

80
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And I don't necessarily disagree with that because we just had a conversation about the KDE project

81
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
and I think a big part of their issue that they now face is improper branding originally or inconsistent branding.

82
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And I can't really blame the Enlightenment, or I'm sorry, elementary guys.

83
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Obviously, they have some branding problems because I'm too dumb to remember it.

84
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I can't really blame elementary OS for wanting to have a strong brand.

85
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yes, that's their fault that you're dumb.

86
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Right, yeah, of course.

87
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
We have the same problem.

88
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Actually, when we changed the logo, do you remember when our logo used to be three colors?

89
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yes.

90
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The search for friends, right?

91
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And now it's one color and it's a specific DD4814 open to orange.

92
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And that's the hex code, by the way, DD4814.

93
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Nice, dude.

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Nice.

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'll remember that.

96
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
For some reason, someone set up DD4814.com and it's just a big orange screen.

97
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So you know that that's the right color, right?

98
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Yeah.

99
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:03,000
But the thing is, when that logo came out, people still afterwards use the old logo in their websites and materials and blog posts.

100
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And some of our design team used to get a little bit annoyed and they'd send little pings to the people to say,

101
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
hey, can you can you change your favicon because it's the old logo and we're now using the new one?

102
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Can you change that article?

103
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Can you change this?

104
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And some of them got a little bit funny and got a little bit upset about people not using the new logo.

105
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So I can see how people can get a little bit funny about the branding being missing.

106
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Right.

107
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's embracing the sun

108
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
and just barbecued up some tasty chicken.

109
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
My name is Chris.

110
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And my name is Matt.

111
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Hey, Matt. I'm telling you, man.

112
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I went over to Savannah Meats, you know, best meat around.

113
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I got one of those whole chickens.

114
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I put it on its...

115
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Have you seen the beer butt chicken before?

116
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Have you seen that?

117
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Oh yeah.

118
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Yeah. Well, this is like an official like cast iron beer butt permanent chicken fixture that you put the chicken on top of.

119
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So oil, garlic, some bacon grease, some dry rub.

120
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Matt, Matt, best chicken I've had all year.

121
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So good.

122
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Nice.

123
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yeah. So I'm coming off a nice fresh chicken meal.

124
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And it turned out delicious.

125
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
But that didn't mean we closed up all the windows at JB1 Studios.

126
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So it is hot here today.

127
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
That's okay.

128
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm going to refresh myself with some good Linux topics.

129
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That'll be my source of refreshment.

130
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You know, we had a lot of really good comments on last week's episode of Linux Action Show.

131
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm really glad you guys liked them all.

132
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And our first bit of follow up in that area came in the topic of containers.

133
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Now, if you didn't catch last week's Linux Action Show,

134
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
we talked about how the Gnome project, Gwadek, their big conference is coming up.

135
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And one of the things that's going to be hot on the topic list is containerization and sandboxing of applications on the Linux desktop.

136
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And we mentioned, boy, we could see how this could maybe raise some ire in the Linux community.

137
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And we suspected people might get a little upset.

138
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Well, Matt, that's just exactly where our first feedback is going to take us this week is right to that topic.

139
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So if you want more details on that, you can jump in on last week's Linux Action Show.

140
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
But you don't have to.

141
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
We'll get you up to date right here because it was Crossroads 1112 that wrote in.

142
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And Crossroads is easy in the... Crossroads, you should have joined us for the virtual log.

143
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That would have been perfect.

144
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Anyways, he wrote in.

145
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
He said, here's my concerns with containerization of software on the desktop.

146
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
He said, let me preface this by saying that it's not a rant.

147
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm not yelling or screaming about the possibility.

148
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's very possible that my concerns will be addressed and these will be non-issues.

149
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So he seems like he's being pretty rational about it.

150
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
He says, up first, my first concern, which is the exact same thing you said on the show on Sunday, Matt, updating.

151
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
As Matt said, putting software in containers could make updating more difficult.

152
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And I actually, I think that's funny because I think the way he's thinking about it is like through a software manager.

153
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Like, you know, I'm sorry, a package manager like Pacman or Apt.

154
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I think contained applications are going to be delivered through app stores.

155
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I really do.

156
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You've got the Gnome Software Center, whatever they're calling it that they're working on.

157
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
KDE's got something they're working on.

158
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I really think when you get these apps, they're going to be distributed.

159
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
A lot of the distributions are doing this already.

160
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Like, if you have Fedora today, you can use the Gnome Software Center and it uses PackageKit to install applications for you.

161
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Pretty much one of the few distributions it doesn't work on is Arch.

162
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
There's no PackageKit interface to Pacman.

163
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
That aside, if you look at that, maybe that'd be one way they could handle it.

164
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So, crossroads, I wouldn't worry too much about updating.

165
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And I also think your package manager will still be available to you.

166
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
He says, there could also be possible app compatibility.

167
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Now, this is the one I was worried about.

168
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I forgot to mention it in the show.

169
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
He says, what if I need software A to interact with software B, but no API to allow those two to talk, right?

170
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Because they're both individually in sandboxes.

171
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
They can't even see each other.

172
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
They're not even aware each other are running.

173
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And so, if there isn't an API to allow them to communicate, then this is not going to happen.

174
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
He says, obviously, this wouldn't be a problem for probably about 95% of interactions, but for the 5%, it'd be a huge problem.

175
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And that's a great question.

176
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm sure they actually have talked about a solution to solve that problem.

177
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
They have a good name for it, too.

178
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I just forgot what it was.

179
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I don't know if anybody in the Mumble Room is aware of the name that the Gnome Project is talking about to allow applications to communicate.

180
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's like the way the Android system works.

181
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's like the way Windows Mobile does in the new iOS extensions.

182
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's that same kind of – there's an infrastructure in place.

183
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And then applications can communicate via that infrastructure.

184
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So, they have addressed it, but I don't know the details on it.

185
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And then, last but not least, this is the one I think probably resonated with a lot of the folks.

186
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
The Linux way of installing software is better than the Windows way.

187
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I don't want to go hunting around the internet for software containers like I do on Windows.

188
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I want to install software either from the terminal or a GUI, either it be Synaptic or Pacman XG, Ubuntu App Store, etc.

189
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Perhaps I've been spoiled by the AUR and the ability to install pretty much any package without internet hunting.

190
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
And that's a great point.

191
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But again, I think if they deliver it through app stores, I think that could help.

192
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Now, I'm not saying app stores are the future of Linux.

193
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm talking about a specific kind of apps, like GNOME Maps, and things like that,

194
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,000
that will be available through these software centers that at first will seem very awkward and clunky to use on a Linux desktop

195
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
because we all love our Pacman-S.

196
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
But it's one of those things that I think after a while will just seem natural.

197
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Like all of your main tools will still be available at the command line.

198
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I mean, this has to be the way of the future, right?

199
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Well, so here's the way I see it.

200
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And correct me if I'm wrong, but potentially if we did go with a package manager for, say, containers, for example,

201
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
instead of installing applications, wouldn't you just be able to just install like a new container over the old one?

202
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Yeah, exactly.

203
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So in essence, it really becomes a mood issue.

204
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You could literally arrange it to where you could still use the command line.

205
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You could still use a GUI.

206
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You know, Bob's your uncle.

207
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Yeah, very much so.

208
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Wimpy, you wanted to key in on the Android aspect of this?

209
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Go ahead.

210
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Well, APKs are containerized applications just by another name.

211
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:54,000
The APK contains everything that the application requires, including libraries for multiple architectures,

212
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
and your user data lives elsewhere.

213
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So yeah, I think delivered through an app store type presentation, it would work.

214
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And the GNOME extensions already deploys the extensions via the extensions website, which is app store-like.

215
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I don't know what the big fuss is about.

216
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
This is nothing new to anyone, really.

217
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
We've been doing this for years now.

218
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Poppy, this is probably a problem that's being solved on Ubuntu Touch, correct?

219
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yep.

220
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
We have click packages, which are containered applications.

221
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
They can't talk to each other directly, but they can talk to each other via Content Hub, for example.

222
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So they can pass messages backwards and forwards, and like, you know, your gallery app can get a photo from the camera,

223
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
or you can download a music file via the web browser and send it to the music app, that kind of stuff.

224
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Same kind of stuff that happens on Android.

225
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And yeah, we have a central app store, but equally the same as Matt was saying,

226
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
you could still install stuff via the command line because the click packages you could go and download,

227
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
or someone could build one for you, a custom one, side-load it on the phone and install it.

228
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I don't think there's anything terribly bad going on here.

229
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It makes total sense, and yeah, it's got an app store just like you say.

230
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Yeah, and I think one of the other comments I've seen is,

231
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
well, man, one of the things I love about Linux is that everything is dynamically linked.

232
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I don't think that goes away.

233
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
In fact, you could have these packages work in a sense where if the necessary libraries are there

234
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
and they're the correct version, it uses those.

235
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And if the necessary libraries are not there, or the correct version is not present,

236
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
it uses something that's internal or statically linked or something like that.

237
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So that's a possibility, but also you think about it,

238
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I think the way I'm envisioning this is layered, right?

239
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
So you'll have the very, very top layer of a Linux desktop system or laptop system

240
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
that has sandbox applications, a sandbox display manager, a sandbox desktop,

241
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
sandbox web browser, and it truly guarantees or gets as close as we can to guaranteeing

242
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
a safe, private, open source desktop, okay?

243
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I think that's the top layer.

244
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Then just below that you have all the GNU utilities, you have all of the command line stuff,

245
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
all of the package manager stuff, all of the shared libraries.

246
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It doesn't go away. It's still there.

247
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And then below that you have like systemd, and then you get down to the kernel.

248
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And that's essentially how I'm seeing this structured, right?

249
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And it does mean things a little differently, and I wouldn't be surprised if these containers

250
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
were just simply installed to your home directory.

251
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Maybe there'd be like an apps folder in your home directory.

252
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And then you just back that up, and you've just backed up all of the installed applications on Linux.

253
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And one of the things they talk about in the GNOME sense is if you have these containers,

254
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
these bundle files, these APKs, then the GNOME desktop can be aware of those and what they are,

255
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
and you could have a descriptor file, a.desktop file, in those APKs,

256
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
and you could automatically have the shortcuts added to the GNOME menu

257
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
regardless of where they're at as long as the GNOME desktop reads that file.

258
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So you could back up that entire directory, do a clean install,

259
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
drop that entire directory back into your home folder, point the GNOME menu at it,

260
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
it would reread all of the.desktop files and recreate all of the links

261
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
in your GNOME application menu for those apps.

262
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's pretty cool, and it makes backup a hell of a lot easier.

263
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And if you think about like, you know how my mom backs up her Mac right now?

264
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
She never even thought about it any other way.

265
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
She never thought about how I should back it up.

266
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
She got an external USB drive, and then she went and took her Photoshop folder,

267
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
and she clicked it from her applications folder and drug it to the hard drive

268
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
and said, okay, I've backed up.

269
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And to her, she's backed up the program now.

270
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And that's how she thinks about it, is this is right, exactly.

271
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
So this is something that regular users have a hard time understanding,

272
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
and they have certain expectations that binaries are portable to them

273
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
by their very nature.

274
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I should be able to pick up a binary off one computer

275
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
and drop it on another computer and just run it.

276
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
And if you can't do that, then there's something wrong with the operating system

277
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
because that's the operating system's job is to run applications.

278
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
That's how they see it.

279
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
They don't think about libraries and all that kind of,

280
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
and dependencies and all that kind of stuff.

281
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
And I think this could go huge to addressing that

282
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
because I don't think it's going to neuter the power users.

283
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You guys know me.

284
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm the first person to be like, screw the fictional new user.

285
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Focus on the power users.

286
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You know that's usually my mantra.

287
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
But in this case, I think it gives enough benefits to new users

288
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
and enough benefits to power users and enough security and privacy

289
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
that I think it's a win-win.

290
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And I wouldn't be surprised to see a lot of desktops implement this.

291
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Oh, definitely.

292
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I think if we're in a position to where it's like, look,

293
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I can still pop a drop-down terminal and pound out what I need to

294
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
to get my software updated or installed,

295
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I can't see why anyone would have a problem.

296
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
That's just my philosophy.

297
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
There you go.

298
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
All right.

299
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Ben wrote in to update us on his command line challenge.

300
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Quick thank you, too.

301
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
We got some reports in.

302
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Some folks were like, dude, this one guy's like, dude,

303
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I had a netbook running Arch.

304
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It was my only machine because my main computer died.

305
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I had it for like three months or I think it was two months.

306
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Only could use the command line.

307
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It was no problem.

308
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
However, Ben, who wrote in last week about starting the command line challenge,

309
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
wrote in this week to give us an update.

310
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
He says, hey, guys, I just wanted to give you an update

311
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
to the command line challenge.

312
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I hate to say it, but I caved.

313
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I caved.

314
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
On Thursday, I logged back into my desktop, fired up Iceweasel.

315
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I just couldn't do it anymore.

316
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
The nice thing is I'm now way more comfortable in the command line

317
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
than I was before.

318
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Great point.

319
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
That's a great benefit.

320
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
He says, thanks for the show.

321
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
So the command line challenge didn't last too long for Ben.

322
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Hey, Ben, no judgey here.

323
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It wouldn't last much longer.

324
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
We got an email.

325
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Somebody was like, dude, as a long-time sysadmin and pen tester,

326
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
how do you not understand living in the command line?

327
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And I wrote him back and I was like, dude, you don't understand at all.

328
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I live.

329
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I fight for the GUI.

330
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I fought for the user.

331
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I was there through the bad days and all the industry crap that we had to slog

332
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
through to get decently performing GUI desktops.

333
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I don't want to go back.

334
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And I like my web browser.

335
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I like my VLC.

336
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I like my instant messaging client and all that stuff.

337
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I don't want to go back.

338
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I could do it.

339
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Just because you can doesn't mean you want to.

340
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Right, exactly.

341
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
That's exactly it.

342
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
That's how I felt about it.

343
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's like, but dude, command line.

344
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm like, bro, I know.

345
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I know about the command line.

346
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
All right.

347
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Roy wrote in with two questions for the virtual lug.

348
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
He says, hey, all my name is Roy.

349
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Over the last year, I've set up a couple emails.

350
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I've sent a couple emails you mentioned on the show about my moving to Arch experience.

351
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Oh, great, Roy.

352
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
He's like, okay.

353
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
And this is what I love about Roy because he's right where my head's at right now.

354
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
He says, I'm all in on de-clouding.

355
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And for almost every service now I use, I attempt to establish in my own,

356
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm trying to set up my own service on my own fanless Arch server at home.

357
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Nice.

358
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
So I was looking at email servers.

359
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
And I think he's directing this at you, Mumble Room.

360
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And I recently found the Colab suite.

361
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Does anyone have experience with Colab?

362
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I.e., is it any good?

363
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And do you know, this is the second part, do you know how to install it on Arch as I failed to find it?

364
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Anybody have Colab?

365
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Anybody tried it on Arch in the Mumble Room?

366
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
We got a big group here today.

367
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Nobody.

368
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I haven't tried it on Arch, but I have tried it.

369
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
What do you think of Colab in general, Wimpy?

370
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's quite good if you haven't used something better.

371
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Oh.

372
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
That's what I'd say.

373
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
So yeah, I did try it.

374
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
At work, we've been using Zimbra for some years.

375
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And we're looking to decide whether we're going to upgrade to the new Zimbra or move to something else.

376
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:05,000
So I've had to go through all of the sort of big collaboration suites that you can run on open source platforms.

377
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And Colab was obviously one of those I tried.

378
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And it is very good, but it doesn't stand up against Zimbra very well.

379
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Oh, that's what I was going to ask you to see.

380
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
That's exactly what I'm finding too.

381
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,000
But the counter argument there is that these days Zimbra isn't that open source friendly.

382
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's not as open source friendly as it used to be a couple of years ago.

383
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
So there's not the packages that are available for the different distributions now.

384
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It's a lot more heavy lifting involved.

385
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's not as well documented.

386
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
So it swings in roundabouts.

387
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
So Colab's definitely very good.

388
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Not as good as Zimbra, but I'm probably not going to use Zimbra either.

389
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Go ahead, Eric.

390
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You had a question about...

391
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Yeah.

392
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
My question about that app is this.

393
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Is it open source?

394
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And does he know how to compile it?

395
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
And then I'm sure somebody could walk him through it.

396
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Colab?

397
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Yeah.

398
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
And there's packages too.

399
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Yeah.

400
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Although I've looked at it.

401
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I haven't tried it extensively.

402
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
The one of the bunch that I've actually had production deployments and probably a version

403
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
or so ago was Zimbra.

404
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And this de-clouding thing, it's definitely something I'm starting to take very seriously.

405
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Before, it's always been sort of intellectual masturbation for me.

406
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Like how would I accomplish it?

407
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I feel like I spent the last year kind of intellectually masturbating different ways

408
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
to get out of the cloud.

409
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
And sort of, again, my favorite new word, digesting.

410
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Like what are the ramifications that we're learning?

411
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
And if you guys watch Tech Talk today and on Filter, you might have heard about some

412
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
more recent revelations that came out that are just uncomfortable.

413
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
They make me uncomfortable.

414
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Today, I ran a story on Tech Talk today about the U.S. government saying the Fourth Amendment

415
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
doesn't apply to data stored in cloud services.

416
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Oh, seriously?

417
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Yeah.

418
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
That physical protections don't apply to digital goods and that that authority allows them

419
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
to not just reach within the U.S., but they're trying to currently get data off of a Dublin

420
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
server that Microsoft has for a drug trafficking case.

421
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And to me, I don't think I'm going to be targeted, but I feel like that, A, is something that

422
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'm not comfortable with and I need to vote with my own body, with my own usage.

423
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And B, I feel like in order for these things, these independent options to exist, people

424
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
have to be using them.

425
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
There has to be consumer demand for them to thrive or else they'll just go away if they

426
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
don't have a user base and I'm somebody who's in a position to use them.

427
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
So I sort of almost feel a responsibility in some sense.

428
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
So the big one for me is Gmail, Google, calendars.

429
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And the Google one's a big one, right?

430
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Because that's really very integrated these days.

431
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I really got to be honest, Google calendars is my favorite calendar implementation.

432
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Gmail's probably my favorite webmail, right?

433
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
So I've been trying to think of how do I move out of the cloud, but not just move out, but

434
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
make it a better experience for me.

435
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
And the way I'm looking at it is I'll try one thing for a little while.

436
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And I'll see like, okay, if I do this off of Google, like I've tried Hackpad for a little

437
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
bit and I'm looking at setting up Etherpad for a little while and trying that and maybe

438
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
switching to BitTorrent Sync more instead of Dropbox and BitTorrent Sync.

439
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
These kinds of things, I'm trying to find out how I can kind of not get off the grid,

440
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
but have more of a say in the services I choose.

441
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Because one of the things I'm discovering too is like with Android in particular is once

442
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,000
you opt in at one level, you kind of go all in and you kind of like you end up on the

443
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
grid regardless.

444
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
You don't have a choice.

445
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
If you wanted to use a device, like this is why I'm so excited about things like Ubuntu

446
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Touch and Firefox OS, because I want to have a device where I can elect to use maybe BitTorrent

447
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Sync for my photo sync, maybe my own LDAP server for my contacts and my own IMAP server

448
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
and have that experience be a first class experience.

449
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Not have it be hobbled because I'm not using the Gmail app, because I'm not using the calendar

450
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
app, because that's what you get on Android now is if you choose not to opt into the Google

451
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
experience, all of the Google services, you get second rate applications.

452
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And that I'm sick of, I'm so sick and tired of that.

453
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Is that force opt in, you're all in, balls deep, you got the tracking, we got data on

454
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
you, you got an account with us, you got a Google Plus account now, have at it bro, welcome

455
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
to Android.

456
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
And that I'm sick of.

457
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
That I'm sick and tired of.

458
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Because there's other ways out there, there's other services out there.

459
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
You know, maybe I want to use Amazon for my music.

460
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
You can do all of it on Android today, but it's becoming less and less of an option and

461
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
that drives me crazy because it's all running on top of Linux.

462
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And that's one of the things that really gets me.

463
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
So I'm totally right where he's at right now.

464
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Where I'm looking at like, what can we bring in house?

465
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Not only can I have it on the land so it runs better, but now I don't have to worry about

466
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
this weird, like, sure if the US government wants to come get emails that were sent to

467
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
me by some listener, then they'll have to come knock on the actual studio door and hand

468
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
me a warrant.

469
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
They can't just deliver it through some automated system to Google and then Google just extracts

470
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
it from my Google account and delivers it to them.

471
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
They have to come to me to get it.

472
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
And at least that's something, at least then I know it's happening.

473
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
But I'm legitimately in a position where people send me confidential information that's encrypted.

474
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I communicate with people that are all over the world on a daily basis.

475
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I research stuff that's obviously going to, in some cases, be considered by some agencies

476
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
worth monitoring.

477
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I mean, at what point do you start going, okay, maybe I should start taking some steps

478
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
to preserve my own privacy and put things under my own control.

479
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
And then I start thinking about it from a father's perspective.

480
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
And I start thinking about when my son and daughter come to me for school or whatever

481
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
and they say, okay, Dad, we need an email account.

482
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Do I want to elect, do I want to say, okay, guys, go get a Google account.

483
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Have a lifetime of your information being observed by Google.

484
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I don't think that's a good idea.

485
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
So I want to set some stuff up too.

486
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
So I'm thinking about it a lot.

487
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
But, you know, it's really hard to make a move and not take a considerable hit in functionality

488
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
these days.

489
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Well, it feels like there's a lack of out of the box options, you know, really.

490
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Yeah, that's for sure.

491
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And if you really want like the stuff that everybody's really excited about, you know,

492
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
you got to kind of opt into the system a little bit.

493
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
So it's something.

494
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
So I have right now on my Nexus 5, I'm triple booting.

495
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I'm going to put L on there.

496
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I don't have L on there right now.

497
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I just have the latest Android.

498
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
But Ubuntu Touch and Firefox OS.

499
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I tell you out of the three, Android is obviously the one that's the most feature complete for

500
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
me because it's got things that I use like Waze and Evernote, which I only really use

501
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
when I'm traveling.

502
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
But it's nice to have them when I do need them.

503
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
So it's not like I need them all the time.

504
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
But Ubuntu Touch, you know, as far as like then compared to Firefox OS, I definitely

505
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
think I prefer the Ubuntu Touch experience.

506
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
So I figure I'm going to triple boot that for a little while and see what that's like.

507
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
But at the end of the day, I have to be realistic.

508
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I want a smartphone that has a great camera because I have three adorable children and

509
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I want to be able to send those pictures to my wife when I take a great picture.

510
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And if I get lost, I want to be able to launch Waze.

511
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And I don't think that's unreasonable to expect from a smartphone.

512
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Well, and I think what's scary is that if I'm correct, you guys can correct me if I'm

513
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
wrong, but I believe Google actually purchased Waze.

514
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
So that app that we all love.

515
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
So it's like, it says what they're doing is you're like, okay, Google, I'm finally free.

516
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Oh, you know, you got that one app I really like and Google's like, we own it.

517
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Yeah.

518
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
And it sucks because it's like, okay, so what's your alternative?

519
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Some podunk GPS thing?

520
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Right.

521
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I'm going to have to use Nokia Hear Maps or whatever they call it.

522
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Well, in fact, Google Maps actually uses information from Waze now.

523
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Yes.

524
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
It's actually kind of handy.

525
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Yeah.

526
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I mean, all of it's very...

527
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And the value of this is negative.

528
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
It's all very, you know, negative, but I tell you...

529
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
And the solution of course is Bing Maps.

530
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Yeah, there you go.

531
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I'm thinking about it.

532
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
There you go.

533
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I'm thinking about it.

534
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Yeah.

535
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I think part of it, and this is to get to, actually I should probably take a little break

536
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
right here and thank our first sponsor because to get to it, Ting is part of that stack,

537
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
right?

538
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
But this is a part that desperately needs address and that's why I'm really enthusiastic

539
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
about Ting.

540
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
So go to linux.ting.com, that'll get you $25 off your first device or if you already have

541
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
a device compatible Ting, $25 of credit.

542
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Now here's why Ting's great.

543
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
No contract.

544
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
They just kill that and you only pay a flat $6 per month per line.

545
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
The reason why this is huge is it changes the value model completely.

546
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Instead of trying to trick you into paying more than you need so that way you don't go

547
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
over, you just pay for what you use.

548
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
And if you need hotspot and tethering, you check the box and now it's just your data

549
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
usage.

550
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
That's genius.

551
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Ting is open like that too.

552
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I tell you what, I had Ubuntu Touch on the Nexus 5, fired it up, got right on the Ting

553
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
network, started making calls.

554
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Couldn't hang up with the Ubuntu Touch operating system, but I could make calls on the Ting

555
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
network.

556
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
That was cool.

557
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
The hanging up part was a bug, which is fixed now.

558
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And it's really great.

559
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Yeah, I just have that freedom and flexibility, plus they have fantastic support.

560
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
You can call them at 1-855-TING-FTW and a real person answers the phone.

561
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
How nice is that when your phone's not working and you're frustrated and you just want to

562
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
get it solved.

563
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
That's right.

564
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
And they'll help you get out of your contract.

565
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
If you go over to ting.com slash ETF, they have an early termination relief program.

566
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
They'll pay up to $75 per line that you have to get canceled.

567
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
So that'll get you out of your contract.

568
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Then you can go contract free.

569
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
And check out their savings calculator when you go to linux.ting.com.

570
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Put your current details in there, your actual usage, not what you're paying for, not how

571
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
they're scamming you, but what you actually end up using and see how much you would save.

572
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
And I've been talking to the folks over at Ting about my current frustrations with vendor

573
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
lock-in, and so they sent me over an iPhone 5 for free.

574
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I'll be trying out iOS 8 and doing an iOS 8 and Android L head-to-head comparison in

575
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
the future.

576
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
So if you've got any thoughts on that, I'd love to hear it.

577
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Noah, don't cry, though.

578
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Don't cry, Noah.

579
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I know he's up in the mumble room right now like, what?

580
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Yes, I'll probably have an iPhone 5 running iOS 8 at OSCON.

581
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I know, it's egregious.

582
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I know.

583
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
It's absolutely egregious.

584
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
But it's an interesting experiment.

585
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And I'm going to see, can I connect to my own IMAP server, my own LDAP server?

586
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Can I use BitTorrent Sync as my storage backend?

587
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Because iOS 8 is supposed to have some sort of application extension linking, I don't

588
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
know.

589
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
But what I'm really curious about is how do the two operating systems stack up?

590
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
And Ting's like, dude, we'll send you an iPhone 5 to try it.

591
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
So I got an iPhone 5 for a little bit.

592
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I'll be kicking the tires, and I'll give you my thoughts on that in the future and see

593
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
how L and iOS 8 stack up, both maybe as the OSes get a little closer to maturity.

594
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I'll do that comparison.

595
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Go to linux.ting.com.

596
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
They've got a lot of great phones.

597
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
The Nexus 5 runs amazing on the Ting network.

598
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
That's my daily driver.

599
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
You can get the iPhone 5 through their partners at Glide for $250.

600
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
You own it.

601
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
$250.

602
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
You own it.

603
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Off contract.

604
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
$6 a month.

605
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
They've also got MiFi devices if you need a data connection.

606
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
So you can go over there and rock that for a flat $6 a month.

607
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
It's a $6 hotspot at that point.

608
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Linux.ting.com.

609
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Go see what I've been talking about.

610
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Go see why Ting rocks so hard.

611
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And now I've got three devices on my Ting network.

612
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
How about that?

613
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Three devices.

614
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Look at me.

615
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I'm like a phone roller.

616
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
The phone ranger over here.

617
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
So I'll give you my report soon.

618
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Linux.ting.com.

619
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Go check them out.

620
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Go get yourself a great phone.

621
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
They've got feature phones, Android phones, Windows phones, all of it.

622
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Linux.ting.com.

623
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
And a really big thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

624
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Love that.

625
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Good deal.

626
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
That's sweet.

627
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
All right.

628
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Noah, are you okay?

629
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Noah, are you okay?

630
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I'm calming down.

631
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I'm glad that you're bringing an iPhone because I was hoping we could make it to the gun range.

632
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Nice.

633
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
No, I think Noah's going for large caliber on this.

634
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I don't know.

635
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I'll bring mine.

636
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Noah's like, I know he's got a Nexus 5 with him, so if I end up destroying the iPhone,

637
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I know he's not going to be out of communication.

638
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
So there's a little risk is what he's thinking.

639
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
He's walking in with a desert eagle.

640
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Yeah.

641
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Hey, you know, we talk a lot on the show.

642
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Actually, this is the wrong way to describe this.

643
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
One thing that we never talk about on the show, but people who watch the video version

644
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,000
see this all the time is my desktop setup.

645
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:37,000
And we got a request in from Kaz21 just to kind of go over a little bit of what I use.

646
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
And some of the stuff I use, I know a lot of the Mumble folks use.

647
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
So here, I'll show you.

648
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Kaz, if you're watching the video version of Linux Unplugged, here is essentially what

649
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I use on my GNOME box.

650
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
So for the theme, this is, I guess I should say, this is the latest version of GNOME.

651
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
My window theme is Numix.

652
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
The GTK theme is Numix.

653
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
My icons are Numix Circle.

654
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
My cursor is oxygen white.

655
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
That way it pops and I can see it.

656
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
And I have this Akuito shell to get the nice transparencies, which are cut off on my camera

657
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
shot.

658
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
You can't see them.

659
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
My conkey setup you asked about, I'm actually just cheating.

660
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I'm using Conkey Manager, an app pick before that sets it up.

661
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
It's actually a little broken right now, but I like the way it looks.

662
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
And I have global dark theme turned on.

663
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
So it's a nice, yes, flat.

664
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I know.

665
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I know.

666
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
It's flat.

667
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
It's a nice flat GTK theme that I like quite a bit.

668
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Mumble Room, you guys have anything you do to tweak your desktop?

669
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Oh, the other thing I do is I have a bunch of tweaks installed for Firefox, but you guys

670
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
can't really see those most of the time.

671
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
So that's kind of it.

672
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Oh, I guess I could cover my extensions.

673
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I have a ton of extensions, actually.

674
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I mean, Numix kind of changed.

675
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I just kind of, once Numix came out, I kind of went all in on Numix.

676
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,000
But my favorite GNOME desktop extensions are the audio output switcher, which allows me

677
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
to toggle my audio sources really super quick, which is great since I'm doing that all the

678
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
time.

679
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
The caffeine extension, dash to doc, must have.

680
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
It's my favorite doc, and it's just built right in now.

681
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Extension update notifier, todo.txt, top icons.

682
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
You guys can't see this either, but all of the notification icons that normally go down

683
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
in the tray on GNOME are now up along the top, like old school, sort of applet style

684
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
along the top of my bar, which is nice.

685
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
And, oh, this is the best one.

686
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I've got to find it.

687
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Where is the best one?

688
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
It's like minimum workspaces or something like that.

689
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Top icons.

690
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
This is the one that made GNOME finally really work for me.

691
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And what it does is it essentially establishes a set of fixed desktops.

692
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
So it kills the dynamic desktop thing.

693
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
So I always have at least four desktops available to me.

694
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
And then once I use the fourth desktop, then it begins to do dynamic workspace management

695
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
and create virtual desktops for me on demand as I need them.

696
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
So I thought it was called minimum workspaces, but I'm not seeing the extension now.

697
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I totally recommend you get that one, though, because for me, it totally helped me wrap

698
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
my brain around the way virtual workspaces work in GNOME.

699
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
So, yeah, there you go.

700
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Anybody in the Mumba room have anything they want to chime in with their favorite setup

701
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
on GNOME or KDE?

702
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Any new themes?

703
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Yeah.

704
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I would suggest, as far as Konkey goes, Numix has a really cool Konkey layout.

705
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Oh.

706
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
And it's kind of like, it looks like Google now, but you can make it blend with your desktop

707
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
as well.

708
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
But there's also, I love gtile extension.

709
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Yeah, it's gtile.

710
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Yep.

711
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
For Firefox and Thunderbird and whatnot.

712
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Oh, no.

713
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Oh, that's htile.

714
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Sorry.

715
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
That's htile.

716
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
That's htitle.

717
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Oh, yeah.

718
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Gtile is an extension for GNOME that gives you tiling window manager features.

719
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Oh, right.

720
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Yes.

721
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I've used that for a little bit.

722
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Yeah.

723
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
It gives it, yeah, it auto-positions windows for you, and it'll tile them as you open up

724
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
more windows, right?

725
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Right.

726
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And you can control like this, you can set it to automatically turn, tile them and set

727
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
for certain sections based on what app you're opening and stuff like that.

728
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Very cool.

729
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
That's a nice one.

730
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
And we did like a GNOME customization episode ages ago.

731
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
So, if you go dig through the Linux Action Show archive, you'll find info on that.

732
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Hey, we have just a little bit of breaking news.

733
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
That's right, Plasma 5 has been released today.

734
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
The Plasma 5 desktop is out, and we've been kicking the tires a little bit.

735
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I meant to do a demo on last, on Sunday.

736
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I'll try to do one this Sunday.

737
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Eric, you've been running it for a few days now.

738
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
What do you think?

739
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Are you impressed with...

740
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Oh, he's up and staging.

741
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Well, when he gets back, I'll ask him.

742
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I wonder if he's impressed with Plasma 5.

743
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Here's a couple of the highlights.

744
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,000
So, today, July 15, 2014, KD proudly announces the immediate availability of Plasma 5.0,

745
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
providing a visually updated core desktop experience that is easy to use and familiar

746
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
to the user.

747
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Plasma 5.0 introduces a new breeze artwork concept, which you guys might have to go set.

748
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I don't know if it's turned on by default, actually.

749
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
At least on my system, it wasn't.

750
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I've been using the Project Neon ISO to play with it for a little bit.

751
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Now, you have a fully hardware accelerated graphic stack, OpenGL, with the updated modern

752
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:05,000
clean-looking theme sitting on top of Frameworks 5.

753
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
It's definitely a.0 release.

754
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
The testing I've done is 5.0, and it's had some crashing in the limited use I've had.

755
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
So, I would say, at this point, this is a good time for you to jump in and help the

756
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
KDE Project out.

757
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Don't expect it to necessarily be great for your daily driver, just like Joss warned us

758
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
earlier last week.

759
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I'm very excited about it for some reason.

760
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I don't know, Matt.

761
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I don't sense a lot of excitement from you.

762
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I feel like I got all the excitement, and you're kind of like, okay, well, I'll give

763
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
it some time.

764
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Yeah.

765
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I'm one of those people.

766
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
So, I'm weird when it comes to updates.

767
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I'm one of those.1 guys,.2 guys.

768
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
That makes sense.

769
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I like to let things sit in the oven for a while.

770
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I don't know.

771
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
But, at the same time, I want fresh packages.

772
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
But, when it comes to desktops as a whole, whether it be KDE, GNOME, whatever it may

773
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
be, I feel like that leaving it in the oven a little bit doesn't hurt anything.

774
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Well, yeah, for sure.

775
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
It's okay to wait.

776
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Of course, no wonder you say that.

777
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
You're a big XFCE guy.

778
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Yes.

779
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
There you go.

780
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
There you go.

781
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Look at this hip music they got.

782
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Oh, yeah.

783
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Plasma 5.0 Visual Feature Guide, everybody.

784
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Coming at you with a screencast for Plasma 5.

785
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Eck, are you back?

786
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Yeah, I'm back.

787
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Yeah, I saw you were staging somebody.

788
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Did you want to share any of your impressions with Plasma 5?

789
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I know you've been working with it for a few days now.

790
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
What do you think?

791
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Well, today, I am actually running it completely as my main desktop, just to really try it

792
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
out, really get into it.

793
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I have noticed a lot of graphics glitches, a lot of bugs that still need to be worked

794
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
out.

795
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I'm sure they'll get worked out because I've just got standard Intel graphics for the most

796
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
part.

797
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
So that's going to get fixed.

798
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Typically, it has to do with the compositor.

799
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:51,000
If you set the compositor right, make sure you're using OpenGL if you want the effects.

800
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
But for the most part, it looks great.

801
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
It works great.

802
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:01,000
It feels like it's missing a few things compared to the previous experience with 4.

803
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
But honestly, they've already said that they're going to add to that, so I can only see it

804
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
getting better with time.

805
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Right, and the artwork team is continuing their work.

806
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
It's interesting.

807
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:19,000
They went to great lengths to replicate essentially the same basic functionality of the previous

808
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Plasma desktop.

809
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
And to better and worse, I think they've improved it in some areas.

810
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
The typography definitely looks a lot better.

811
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
There's animations that look smoother.

812
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:33,000
To me, I'm excited about this because I love the technology at work here, and I don't know

813
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
if I'm going to switch now.

814
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I'm tempted.

815
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I also saw, especially I'm a little more tempted now because Billy Big Rigger linked in our

816
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
subreddit how to install Plasma 5 on Arch right now.

817
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
It's in the repos.

818
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
So now that I can put it on an Arch box, I can just log into it, and that'd just be one

819
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
of my many desktops.

820
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Yeah, I'm going to do it.

821
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Yeah, so look right here.

822
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I'm going to do it.

823
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Pacman-S K5 and K5-AIDS, and that's it.

824
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
That gets you Plasma 5 and Frameworks 5.

825
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
That's it, right?

826
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
How am I not going to do that?

827
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Because even if it doesn't work, I could just switch back to GNOME.

828
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
So yeah, I'm doing that tonight probably.

829
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
It depends on my hard drive space.

830
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
And I know, Eric, you were talking about loading it up on an Arch box, too.

831
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
That to me is a sweet spot.

832
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I really like to try that because then you're going to get more updates quicker, too, I

833
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
would think.

834
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Yeah.

835
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Well, I would think, except right now I'm tracking the daily with the Project Neon.

836
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Yeah, that's true.

837
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
That's true.

838
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:37,000
But honestly, I want to see what the difference is where Arch is at with it, as opposed to

839
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
running it alongside Kabuntu, essentially.

840
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I think the most well-supported desktops on Arch is KDE.

841
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
They get day of updates and whatnot.

842
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I think one of the core Arch guys is a core KDE guy, but I might have my details wrong

843
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
on that.

844
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
But it's like day of.

845
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I think one of the main distro Arch guys is the maintainer of KDE for the packaging, and

846
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
he just gets it done right away.

847
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Right.

848
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Super awesome.

849
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Well, we have an old soapbox that we haven't gotten on for a long time.

850
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
We're almost at episode 50 now, Matt.

851
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
And something happened when we talked about it on Sunday.

852
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
It got producer Q5 really upset.

853
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
And we're going to talk about that next.

854
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
But first, I want to thank DigitalOcean, sponsors of the Linux Unplugged program.

855
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
DigitalOcean is rocking some stuff right now, you guys.

856
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
This is the time to get in if you're not yet a DigitalOcean customer.

857
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Plus, if you use our promo code, UNPLUGEDJULY, you'll get a $10 credit.

858
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Now, why would you want a $10 credit?

859
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I'll tell you why.

860
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Because DigitalOcean rocks.

861
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
They're a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way

862
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
to spin up a cloud server.

863
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,000
If you're quirky, you can get a cloud server spun up in, what do you do, like, 33 seconds?

864
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
It was amazing.

865
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
It was amazing.

866
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
But most users get a cloud server spun up in about 55 seconds, and pricing plans start

867
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:54,000
at only $5 per month for 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, a blazing fast CPU,

868
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
and a terabyte of transfer for $5 a month.

869
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
And if you use the promo code, UNPLUGEDJULY, you get a $10 credit.

870
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
So you can try it for two months absolutely free, nothing out of your pocket.

871
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Plus, they have hourly pricing.

872
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
That's another great way to go.

873
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
And DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam,

874
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
and now London.

875
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,000
And that's where Corky set up his new DigitalOcean droplet and where you got the rockin' speed.

876
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Their interface is simple.

877
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Their control panel is super intuitive, and power users can replicate that control panel

878
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
on a larger scale with their new API.

879
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
DigitalOcean has grown like crazy because they've combined an amazing interface with

880
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
an efficient system powered by KVM and Linux.

881
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
And congratulations to DigitalOcean.

882
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
They announced the London region today.

883
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
So you can go build yourself a London DigitalOcean droplet right now and use the promo code,

884
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
UNPLUGEDJULY.

885
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
And if you're doing backups, why not do a DigitalOcean droplet in the U.S. and do a

886
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
DigitalOcean droplet in London and sync between them?

887
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
It'll be $10 a month.

888
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
And you could do it for two months for free.

889
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Why not do it?

890
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Go check it out.

891
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
DigitalOcean.com.

892
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Use the promo code, UNPLUGEDJULY.

893
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Go get yourself a root box up in the cloud that you control.

894
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
And they have a great droplet management system too with backup snapshots, all kinds of good

895
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
stuff.

896
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
DNS management, an HTML5 console too.

897
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
You can even watch the thing post and boot.

898
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
It's pretty cool.

899
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
DigitalOcean.com, UNPLUGEDJULY.

900
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
When you check out, thank you.

901
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
And thank you for, you know, when you used UNPLUGEDJULY, that lets them know, hey, I

902
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
appreciate them supporting the Unplugged show.

903
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
So thanks, you guys.

904
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
That's right.

905
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Well, I'll tell you, I keep opening up new droplets.

906
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I keep thinking, oh, God, I could do that one thing.

907
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Oh, yeah.

908
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
And I keep popping up a new one.

909
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
And then I'm like, oh, you know, I could connect these together.

910
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I keep, it's just, it's been definitely become something I spend a lot of time doing.

911
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
It's a lot of fun.

912
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,000
And Wimpy, you were just telling me in the chatroom here, you moved over the Ubuntu Matea

913
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Remix repos to DigitalOcean London?

914
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I did.

915
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
We were using build, we were using build servers in Amsterdam on DigitalOcean.

916
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I took some snapshots, spun up two instances in London and restored the snapshots and then

917
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
destroyed the Amsterdam boxes and all done.

918
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Done?

919
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Done.

920
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
That's so cool.

921
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I love it.

922
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I love it.

923
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
It makes such a cool technology that we all hear about in the abstract actually applicable

924
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
to all of us.

925
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
It makes it accessible to all of us.

926
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
DigitalOcean.com.

927
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,000
And also, they really are fast because the SSDs make all the difference when you're building

928
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
an ISO image.

929
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
And then when you've got two one gig ISO images and you can copy them to your distribution

930
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
servers in 18 seconds, that's pretty great.

931
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Yeah, buddy.

932
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
That's awesome.

933
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Or like Corky is spinning one up in 31 seconds.

934
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
31 seconds.

935
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Okay, 31 seconds.

936
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
How crazy is that?

937
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Nuts.

938
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
That's nuts.

939
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Yeah.

940
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
That's crazy.

941
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
He's breaking in the London data center right now.

942
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I love it.

943
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Okay.

944
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
So speaking of breaking things in, Manjaro.

945
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Boy, did they have a rough weekend.

946
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
So you guys probably heard us talk about it.

947
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Ferronix ran a piece.

948
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
The Manjaro developers suffer a mass exodus was the headline.

949
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Turns out not to be exactly accurate.

950
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Producer Q5Sys is pretty upset that this is still a problem.

951
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
And it's been a particular soapbox of mine.

952
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
It's one of the reasons I launched Tech Talk today.

953
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
It's something we've talked about here on Linux Unplugged before.

954
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
The state of Linux journalism and news blows.

955
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I mean there's exceptions and there's different types.

956
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
There's casual journalism and writing and then there's actual news and event coverage.

957
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
And that's where we're particularly weak.

958
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,000
So to recap, and I don't really mean to go after Michael in particular because I think

959
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
it's more of a symptom of the requirements of the industry and not a reflection of his

960
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
personal character.

961
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,000
But so Ferronix came by some information that the Manjaro developers were leaving the distribution.

962
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
No big deal.

963
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
That happens sometimes.

964
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
People move on.

965
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
But that's not sexy enough to drive clips, Q5 writes.

966
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,000
He says, so what we had here was a really fragrant title.

967
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Like Manjaro Linux developers experience a mass exodus because it drives clicks.

968
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
It hurts the distro, but it drives clicks.

969
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Now in the real world of news reporting, of course, he says there's a thing called verification

970
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
where you independently verify from multiple sources when possible.

971
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
He goes on to point out that the open source community is pretty available.

972
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
A lot of developers are available on Twitter or Google Plus or on mailing lists, not always

973
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,000
and not all projects, but probably more so than most commercial operations where journalists

974
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,000
have to verify information from commercial companies.

975
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:16,000
So he thinks it's perhaps more egregious that the verification isn't happening in open source

976
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
news coverage.

977
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,000
And he says it's because the first to report is the first to get clicks in this world and

978
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,000
clicks equal money, so we've sacrificed truth for convenience and money.

979
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Any thoughts on that part, Matt?

980
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I think he pretty much nailed it.

981
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
See, the problem is that you do dance a balance.

982
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Content as a revenue source these days or as a job or as a business is tough.

983
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
It's tougher than it's ever been.

984
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
And so a lot of companies and a lot of people that write get sucked into that vacuum of

985
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
having to make some tough choices.

986
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
They want to make sure they're breaking the news, but they don't always do a real good

987
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
job of saying, hey, we heard through the grapevine or this has not been substantiated.

988
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
This is merely a rumor.

989
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Instead, it comes out as being a factual thing.

990
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
And as Keefi points out, that's not acceptable.

991
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
You can't do stuff like that.

992
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
And it does blow up in your face and it does create problems and hardships.

993
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Here's the other thing that he goes on to touch on.

994
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
This is something that I think makes it one of these problems that isn't going to get fixed.

995
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
So what happens is you have a lot of misinformed users.

996
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
The project takes a PR damage.

997
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
It looks bad in the image.

998
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,000
It's like the way you and I touch on is like even if there was a max exodus or not,

999
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
the point you and I were making on Sunday's Linux action show was it's a stain on the

1000
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
reputation regardless.

1001
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
It's a stain on the reputation and it's now in the common consciousness.

1002
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
But Q5 Sys says there's even a more ugly side.

1003
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Intentionally not verifying information can sometimes create a lot of drama.

1004
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
And drama, my friends, equals clicks.

1005
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
So what's our mantra?

1006
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
We take a story out first if it's wrong and creates drama.

1007
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
No problem.

1008
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
That's a plus.

1009
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
It'll drive more traffic to the site.

1010
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
We can later retract any false information once we actually have been presented with

1011
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
the correct information.

1012
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
It's really quite simple math.

1013
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Drama equals clicks.

1014
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Clicks equal money.

1015
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Thus drama equals money.

1016
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Rod and Corpse, go ahead.

1017
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I was just going to say is that he said it was being kind of easier or more egregious

1018
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,000
because there are so many ways to get contact with these different people.

1019
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
And that's true and it's a good thing and a bad thing because if you think about it,

1020
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
it makes it harder to find out where these people are.

1021
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
So some projects in the open source community are almost impossible to find

1022
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
contact information about particular people.

1023
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
But some are really easy.

1024
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Manjaro is one of the easy ones.

1025
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
All you need to do is go to their team page on their about section and you're done.

1026
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Right.

1027
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Yeah.

1028
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:46,000
And this is one of those problems where I understand like it's a lean operation.

1029
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
He wants to post as fast as possible.

1030
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
It's a good scoop if it's true.

1031
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:56,000
And he also has a, you know, it's rare to be able to legitimately totally originally

1032
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
break a story.

1033
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
You know, you can be one of the first people to jump on a story often in tech reporting

1034
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:06,000
but to actually have like a source and run an original story that then you become the

1035
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
originator of that story and everybody links to you.

1036
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
That's more than your average drama click.

1037
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
That's like something that sustains for a few days.

1038
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
And so that's a really tempting morsel to go after.

1039
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
And that's influenced by the economies of that type of site.

1040
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,000
That's why and I don't see Jupiter Broadcasting isn't at a scale where we could do something

1041
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
like this.

1042
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:33,000
But I would love to have a written component to our shows because if our main focus is

1043
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
to generate revenue from the shows and potentially through Patreons and things like that,

1044
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,000
then the news reporting becomes a function that supports our shows and thus the more

1045
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
accurate and detailed it is, the better it makes our shows.

1046
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
And so as a byproduct of producing our shows, we could produce better news potentially.

1047
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
I don't know if that's true, but I do know we don't have the scale for it.

1048
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
But we can take steps at Jupiter Broadcasting.

1049
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,000
And that's why on Sunday, Rob from the Mangero Project is going to join us on the Linux Action Show.

1050
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
And we'll just chat with Rob and find out what the hell is going on and we'll get it

1051
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
straight from the horse's mouth and we can ask our questions.

1052
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,000
And Matt, as a longtime Mangero user, anything you want to throw his way, you can ask him

1053
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
and we'll just get it straight, right?

1054
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Definitely.

1055
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Definitely.

1056
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I think I'd actually welcome that because I like the project.

1057
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I just I was very frustrated by the fact that I felt like there was a lot of unknowns

1058
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
and because it was an important box, I had to make some tough choices.

1059
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
But who knows?

1060
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Maybe I can come back.

1061
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Yeah.

1062
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Maybe you can be drawn back.

1063
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Derek Devlin, go ahead.

1064
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
You have some thoughts.

1065
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Yeah, I was wondering, I mean, doesn't people that read for Onyx already had some grain

1066
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
of salt while reading?

1067
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I mean, he also iterates really quick, the articles.

1068
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:43,000
It's not that it's up there maliciously for too long.

1069
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
I can't see really that big of a damage.

1070
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Right.

1071
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
It's only as much as the original developers make it a damage.

1072
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Like, oh, we are concerned.

1073
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
For Onyx said it.

1074
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Well, no.

1075
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I mean, the original reputation damage that he puts out without like actual researching

1076
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
the topic, it doesn't matter if you update your comment.

1077
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
For example, the title is still the same thing.

1078
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
He didn't change the title because he would be changing the SEO stuff.

1079
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
He does pretty bad clickbait titles.

1080
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Yeah, sometimes.

1081
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
But so do I sometimes.

1082
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Let me just fun fact for you guys that are not in content.

1083
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,000
If you want to survive in this industry, you better get used to clickbait or forget it.

1084
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Just stop.

1085
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Just don't even bother.

1086
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I mean, like we try to draw the line.

1087
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Like we won't say like Manjaro was dead.

1088
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Like we didn't title last that.

1089
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Right.

1090
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
But I mean, there's definitely a line you can cross.

1091
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,000
You do want to kind of honestly, you want to excite people across the malicious clickbait titles.

1092
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Right.

1093
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
You don't want to.

1094
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Yeah.

1095
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Malicious stuff is horrible.

1096
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Yeah.

1097
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
And that's and that's the thing is like what he should do.

1098
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
And I don't understand why he doesn't is, OK, he's got his he's got his title.

1099
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
It's totally drawn you.

1100
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
And it's, you know, it's obviously hook in the end.

1101
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
And then when you read the article in a nice, I don't know, grad color at the very top,

1102
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,000
it says rumor mill or, you know, we heard through the grapevine.

1103
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
And then that way people know, hey, we have not substantiated this, but you might want

1104
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
to know this is potentially a thing.

1105
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I'd be OK with that.

1106
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
That would be fine.

1107
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
That's that's a much better idea, I think.

1108
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Here's what also resonated with me.

1109
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Go ahead.

1110
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Normally on news articles like on CNN or they, you know, if it's stuff they haven't confirmed

1111
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
yet, it's like breaking.

1112
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
And this is not confirmed.

1113
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
We've heard blah.

1114
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:22,000
You can't just make claims and then update it after the fact if you happen to be wrong.

1115
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
So if you do enough appropriate couching like this is a developing story.

1116
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
I could see that.

1117
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
And I think it has to be used carefully.

1118
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
You have to make it clear that you don't know this for a fact.

1119
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,000
And when you claim you know things for a fact, that's it's the opposite.

1120
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Well, this is this was Q5 point.

1121
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
And maybe this is where the community comes in is like he says, for me, the saddest part

1122
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
was and is the community continues to allow this to happen several times a year.

1123
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
We have an instance where some news site will get something so horribly wrong that it creates

1124
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
a huge cluster F.

1125
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I mean, at the end of the day, doesn't the buck actually stop with the reader?

1126
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Partly.

1127
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
But you can't just go on to claim bullets for Onix.

1128
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Everybody should know to take it with a grain of salt.

1129
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
That doesn't work.

1130
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
That doesn't scale.

1131
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Right.

1132
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
I didn't know that.

1133
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:14,000
The same thing has happened, you know, before that there was some journalists over at ZD

1134
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,000
net read something on the previous the Wiki and literally started a holy war for no reason.

1135
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Right.

1136
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Yeah.

1137
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Yeah.

1138
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
I know what you're talking about.

1139
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,000
But isn't that funny how that happens to and so I don't know what the right answer is.

1140
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I think I think I honestly I think part of the answer is slower journalism and it's something

1141
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
now and I've talked about it.

1142
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,000
I think just more professional journalism like I understand it's it's a Web site but

1143
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
you could try harder.

1144
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Do less stuff.

1145
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
I see.

1146
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I think the problem is is that he goes for he did not.

1147
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I'm not trying to go for quality because sometimes you can tell he worked really hard on like

1148
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:52,000
he had like this huge massive GPU comparison where he did like 50 GPUs or 60 GPUs that obviously

1149
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
took some work.

1150
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
I'm not saying doesn't work hard but he also goes for quantity.

1151
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Then you look at there's other sites out there like the link blogs where it's maybe one or

1152
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
two posts or three posts a day.

1153
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
But those three posts you almost guaranteed want to read them like like it's all good

1154
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
stuff.

1155
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
And that also means like you could go once a week and get a whole bunch of stuff.

1156
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,000
And I think that slower journalism like one of the mantras what we have with TechSnap

1157
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
is TechSnap is not about breaking news.

1158
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
We don't try to break stories in TechSnap ever.

1159
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:24,000
In fact sometimes we like it if maybe a week's gone by because then we do a deep analysis

1160
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
of all because you have things that come in bursts of information and then there's a slow

1161
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,000
long tail where things get clarified and corrected and people think about it and write up posts

1162
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
about it and then intelligent thinkers like Bruce Schneier and Brian Krebs write about

1163
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,000
it and you can take in what they say and then you can really deliver something that's a

1164
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
good concise analysis that's accurate.

1165
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
But when you're reporting on the moment it happens fast journalism it's just rife with

1166
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
errors.

1167
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
And so I think the as an audience we need to say hey maybe we could slow it down a little

1168
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
bit.

1169
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
What do you think of that Matt?

1170
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Well here's the here's the real issue.

1171
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,000
It's not the journalists are definitely the causality but the same time everybody forgives

1172
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
the aggregator.

1173
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Now I've actually worked closely with a couple of websites to help them get listed with Google

1174
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
News.

1175
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
It doesn't just happen automatically.

1176
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
You know there's special site maps and all sort of stuff.

1177
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
The thing is is that the aggregators are never punished for rewarding this crap.

1178
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,000
See that's the thing whether it be Google search or Google News or whatever the search

1179
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,000
engine or news aggregator maybe we don't penalize these things because they are in fact

1180
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
rewarded for repetition.

1181
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,000
They are rewarded for quick being being first on the first on the scene.

1182
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,000
And so based on those things then writers are then put in an interesting position.

1183
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Sure to game it.

1184
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Yeah.

1185
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Do they want to stay employed throw their morals to the wind or would they like to be

1186
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
absolutely wonderful people and sign.

1187
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Yeah.

1188
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I mean that's that's really what it is.

1189
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I mean I hate to say it but it's the yeah the writers are responsible but at the same

1190
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,000
time you know I always tell people never get into writing it sucks.

1191
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
It really does.

1192
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
So I mean at the end of the day that's the thing people got to remember is also be willing

1193
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
to penalize your aggregator.

1194
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Yeah.

1195
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Be your own aggregator.

1196
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
That's even better.

1197
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
There's no site loyalty.

1198
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
There's no page loyalty.

1199
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
There's no brand loyalty when it comes to articles.

1200
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
No one gives a rip who it's coming from.

1201
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,000
They care about the title and they care about the oh is this interesting to me.

1202
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Well it sounds like Wimpy agrees with you.

1203
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
So Wimpy let me ask you this.

1204
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Isn't that also then sometimes going to run the risk of overreach and censorship and things

1205
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
like that now all of a sudden we're asking maybe somebody like Google to be the arbiter

1206
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
of what's legitimate and what's not.

1207
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
And that's maybe a bad position to be in.

1208
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Wimpy.

1209
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Well my agreement with Matt is not necessarily about Google as the aggregator but in this

1210
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
case as Foronix as the as the aggregator and publisher.

1211
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:38,000
I think that sometimes the articles that they post they know full well are inaccurate.

1212
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,000
But they are sensational and it will drive traffic to the site.

1213
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:48,000
And what is potentially damaging there is that it then tarnishes projects in this case

1214
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Manjaro or it causes problems for projects unnecessarily.

1215
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
And all that happens here is Foronix profit.

1216
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,000
And I don't want to dog on Foronix because it's one of those sites that I read every

1217
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,000
day because like you say there are little gems in there that I don't have to go off

1218
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:11,000
hunting for in the blend of all of the other technology feeds that I consume.

1219
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
It's useful for actually picking up the news.

1220
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
That's a good point.

1221
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:20,000
But there does seem to be a trend at Foronix of deliberately posting what are obviously

1222
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:30,000
trolley articles to drive traffic to the site and that you only have to read from what some

1223
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,000
people have submitted what they want reporting to see that it's bogus.

1224
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Yeah.

1225
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Well Alan let me ask you this then is what Wimpy is saying is it becomes the responsibility

1226
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
of the consumer to pick the right aggregator.

1227
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:47,000
It can because you know their sites kind of fall into different categories.

1228
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Some sites are just aggregated.

1229
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:54,000
They just go out and kind of pick and choose a bunch of stories and link to them and maybe

1230
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
they have a summary or whatever.

1231
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,000
And then there's the other sites that actually write original content like on Brian Krebs

1232
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
his site is kind of a combination right.

1233
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,000
A lot of the stuff is his own research and then he also points to other stuff.

1234
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:11,000
But some sites are obviously there just to collect content that other people have written

1235
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
and those can be very good.

1236
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,000
You basically have to choose to trust that site to pick the right articles for you.

1237
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Right right.

1238
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,000
You can punish them by not returning if they don't find a different one.

1239
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
And that's kind of how TechSnap works right.

1240
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I don't write most of the content that we present in the show.

1241
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I'm just picking through all the news that's out there and deciding which things I think

1242
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
are important to the viewer.

1243
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Right very much.

1244
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
I think it's a lot of our shows kind of work there.

1245
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Same with Tech Talk today as I try to go through and pick the stories from the day that are

1246
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
worth discussing.

1247
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,000
And sometimes that means the end of the week some of them maybe didn't pan out to be great

1248
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
but most of them do.

1249
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,000
And I think that's we have so much to look at so much to consider that that's really

1250
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,000
what we have to do now is pick and choose that we have to learn sources we can trust.

1251
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
And to be honest with you to you know sort of pull back the curtain a little bit that's

1252
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
why we do so much live stuff.

1253
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:05,000
So you guys can show up and hear us when we're just screwing around in our raw natural selves

1254
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:10,000
and you can listen to us as actual human beings and decide if you trust that person if you

1255
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,000
trust that human it's telling you information and maybe you don't want that maybe you do

1256
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
but the live stream gives you a little bit of that experience.

1257
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
And I think that's one of the things that's really great about this form of broadcasting

1258
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,000
is there is a direct avenue for you to kind of learn a little bit more and kind of decide

1259
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
what you think about that person and I think that's great.

1260
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Let's go to last comments and we'll wrap up this topic at PC Wiz you say don't blame

1261
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
the ad agencies bro.

1262
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Ad agencies have to make money.

1263
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:41,000
It makes money when they direct you to a person who's paying for ads.

1264
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:48,000
So if you're being served an ad from Google's ad network to buy some rubbish on Amazon and

1265
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,000
you buy that rubbish on Amazon then they don't care doesn't care where they got referred

1266
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
to.

1267
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Well yeah I mean you really can.

1268
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
I mean at each stage in fact I think that's kind of rotten Corpse's point is we're all

1269
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
a little bit to blame aren't we rotten.

1270
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Yeah I was just about to say like I mean in a way everybody's at fault and if you think

1271
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,000
about it because like the aggregators the article writers the editors even the people

1272
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,000
who are reading it if they don't if they don't even research what these people are saying

1273
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:20,000
to fact check it and in a way they're kind of spreading misinformation as well.

1274
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Yeah and it is I mean I hate to blame readers because you know you don't know what the motivation

1275
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
is of the person who's just sitting there reading the site.

1276
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
But I don't know.

1277
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I think it's kind of in a way it taints the sites themselves but it also kind of taints

1278
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
the idea of news as a whole.

1279
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Right.

1280
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Yeah.

1281
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Oh it's been tainted for a long time.

1282
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Yeah.

1283
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
The problem is is that you know we can we can high and mighty ourselves and pout each

1284
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
other in the back all day long at the end of the day the end of the day we're all going

1285
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
to read it.

1286
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Yeah.

1287
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,000
The other factor is is that until there is a reward slash punishment system implemented

1288
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,000
by somebody I don't care who or whatever it won't change.

1289
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Maybe this is it.

1290
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Maybe this is the beginning of that sort of pushback that eventually forces a market correction.

1291
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Maybe.

1292
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Well I think that the solution is basically look more toward ethical human aggregation

1293
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
and less toward automated aggregation.

1294
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Sure.

1295
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Right.

1296
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Yeah.

1297
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
That I mean that's what we do here at Jupiter Broadcasting is we are human aggregating

1298
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
the good content from crap.

1299
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
You know and one way.

1300
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Robots don't do that.

1301
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,000
One way and this is going to sound all hipster which will work great with my new iPhone 5

1302
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
I got from Ting.

1303
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:32,000
The other way is honestly if you curate who you follow on Twitter and I know that those

1304
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
two words I just said curate and Twitter together I apologize.

1305
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
I will punish myself later.

1306
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,000
But if you do if you're very choosy about who you follow it essentially becomes like

1307
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
an RSS feed so if you say OK this person makes good stuff this person makes good stuff this

1308
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,000
company makes good stuff and you follow them and maybe it's only like 80 to 100 people

1309
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:51,000
you follow every time you go to that feed it's essentially it's good stuff from people

1310
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
you know and that's one way to kind of stay up to date.

1311
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Until we can perfect the BS detector.

1312
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Once that happens it's all good.

1313
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
What are you going to say Alan?

1314
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Well I was going to mention like the same thing because I've noticed that when the odd

1315
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:09,000
time I go to Facebook the stories that are presented are always the link bait crap that

1316
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:14,000
I don't want to look at whereas Twitter because on Twitter I'm following not so much people

1317
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
I went to school with as all the people in the industry that are going to tweet things

1318
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
that I might actually care about.

1319
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I do wish that Twitter had some more tools and settings though because a lot of the people

1320
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,000
I follow are international and so when they tweet in French and Danish I would like to

1321
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
just filter those ones out.

1322
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Yeah.

1323
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
I only want to see when they're tweeting in English.

1324
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Although with you know when people tweet with all the acronyms and stuff I'm pretty sure

1325
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
it's hard to tell when it's English and when it's not.

1326
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Oh rotten corpse points out Yahoo pipes.

1327
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:46,000
All right Daredevil you'll get the last word you wanted to say Google Plus what the F?

1328
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Yes.

1329
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Google Plus integration in the search results if you're logged in while you search actually

1330
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,000
allows you to like a URL.

1331
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:01,000
So and you can see like which friends of yours from Google Plus like that URL while you're

1332
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
in your search.

1333
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
I've never actually once found that useful though.

1334
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Like the theory of it makes sense to me but essentially it's gotten to the point now that

1335
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,000
when I see a Google Plus result in my Google search results I just ignore it.

1336
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
I completely don't even see it anymore.

1337
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I tune it out like an ad.

1338
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:22,000
I do not even see it because to me it has yet because usually at absolute best it is

1339
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,000
a Google Plus post where somebody is linking to a post where if Google would have just

1340
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
given me the link one link deeper that would actually be what I want.

1341
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:33,000
But because they want to drive traffic or something to Google Plus I feel like it's

1342
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
very hit and miss.

1343
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
But I'll try it again.

1344
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,000
I'll give it another shot if you find it useful because I haven't tried it since they rolled

1345
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
it out.

1346
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
No I think you got me wrong.

1347
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:46,000
What I mean is actually any search result in Google allows you to put any.

1348
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:51,000
It doesn't require to be a Google Plus post.

1349
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
It can be any search result.

1350
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:57,000
I guess the problem is their implementation currently only allows you to put like while

1351
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
you're still on the search page.

1352
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:04,000
So people are usually going to still find the content inside that website and then not

1353
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,000
rate the site because you could rate the site.

1354
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
All right.

1355
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
We should move on.

1356
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
I think I'm going to close that topic.

1357
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Q5.

1358
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Good post.

1359
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
It's something we're all thinking about.

1360
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,000
We're taking baby steps here at Jupiter Broadcasting Network to do what we can do.

1361
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,000
So we've got something really I am very excited about next week.

1362
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
I am so excited.

1363
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
I want to tell you about it first though.

1364
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged.

1365
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,000
If you would have traveled back in time and told Chris of five years ago that he'd have

1366
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,000
a sponsor like Linux Academy he would hit you in the face and told you to stop teasing

1367
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
him because that's me.

1368
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,000
This is the perfect sponsor because not only are they Linux enthusiasts themselves.

1369
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,000
It's a group of guys who created the system from scratch because they freaking love Linux

1370
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
and they want to help people learn Linux.

1371
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:53,000
They want you to be able to do it at your own pace at your own leisure on your own system.

1372
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,000
You can download the study guides and read them offline if you want to.

1373
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
They've got audio and video components.

1374
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
So if you're a podcast listener trust me that's going to snap right into your existing flow

1375
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:05,000
and Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged will get you the summer of learning discount.

1376
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:11,000
So go over to Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged right now brand new URL to save 33 percent

1377
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
50 bucks per quarter.

1378
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged is also a good place just to go check them out.

1379
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Give them a hit so that way they know that you heard about it here on the unplugged show

1380
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
and you appreciate them supporting us.

1381
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Go check them out you guys.

1382
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,000
They've got seven plus Linux courses you can take or they support seven plus distributions

1383
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
for their courses.

1384
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
So you choose your distro.

1385
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,000
So in my case let's just say I wanted to brush up on Fedora because as soon as Arch blows

1386
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
it in my face I'm switching to Fedora.

1387
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:38,000
So I go up to Linux Academy dot com and seriously you could literally I'm not even joking this

1388
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
is exactly what you could do.

1389
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
You choose Fedora from the options.

1390
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,000
They automatically adjust all of your courseware.

1391
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
So now it's all Fedora specific right.

1392
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
So now for somebody who's an arch guy but I want to brush up on Fedora and now I'm living

1393
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,000
in the Fedora land with a guided tour I can do self paced tests to see where I'm at.

1394
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
I have step by step guides.

1395
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
This is OK Chris.

1396
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
You're this far into it.

1397
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
You're going to be taking this next.

1398
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
I can generate reports at any time.

1399
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
I can talk to the community see how they're doing.

1400
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
I have course notes and study guides for my Fedora setup.

1401
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,000
If I want to deploy a lamp stack a buying server an open stack whatever it is they've

1402
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
got courses for it.

1403
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
They've got real world scenarios too which is super handy.

1404
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Like if you have an AWS project coming up and you've never worked on AWS or maybe you've

1405
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
worked on AWS but it's been a while and you need to load up a Linux box on there and get

1406
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
a web server going they've got courses on that and you can just go through that.

1407
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
They'll see this how long it's going to take you to do this.

1408
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Take it at your leisure download to this stuff and listen to it on your commute if you need

1409
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
to.

1410
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
It's really awesome.

1411
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
How to get a Linux job is also a course and then they have communities discussing that.

1412
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:40,000
It's really awesome stuff and I've been a subscriber now for I think since the beginning

1413
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
of the year actually.

1414
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,000
And what's really cool about it Matt is they have a team support.

1415
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,000
So if Rekai ends up getting to a point where he's banging on some stuff for JBot and he

1416
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,000
needs to get a little under the hood I can just add him to my account as a group account

1417
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
and he can get in here and now we can work with each other.

1418
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,000
So it's really cool if you're in a team you can do that or if you just want to work on

1419
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,000
your own you have some time it's a really cool system.

1420
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
They've added support too for more and more AWS courses and then as you need a server

1421
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,000
in any of the courses they'll just spin one up on the back end and they're adding new

1422
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,000
courseware all the time so there's always new stuff to go check out and learn and if

1423
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,000
you don't have to create a new VM every time you want to go learn something new they manage

1424
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
all that for you as part of the service.

1425
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
And when you're taking AWS courses that means you don't have to pay for AWS because it's

1426
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
all included with the service.

1427
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:29,000
LinuxAcademy.com slash Dunplug get that 33% discount and take your skills up to the next

1428
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
level.

1429
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,000
There's really never been a better time and this is such an amazing sponsor it's a perfect

1430
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,000
match with our audience it's working with another independent startup company who's

1431
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:43,000
doing exactly something that honestly if I had multiple lives if I had clones of me I

1432
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
would love to run a site like Linux Academy.

1433
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:49,000
It's such a perfect companion to your Jupyter broadcasting experience because we talk about

1434
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
this stuff and then you can go get nitty gritty with that stuff.

1435
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,000
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged and thanks to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Linux

1436
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Unplugged show.

1437
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,000
You know what's awesome about it is I'm always hearing from people via email it's like you

1438
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,000
know I'm looking to advance my career in this field and I really need to gain some skills

1439
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,000
and I really don't have time to go to a brick and mortar school or hey I'm unemployed and

1440
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
I'm looking to get some Linux skills in the first place or whatnot.

1441
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,000
This is a great place to actually get your feet wet and get it done today.

1442
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Yeah it's so great and it's such a neat system and they built it just to do this.

1443
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
So a couple of things.

1444
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Also just a reminder.

1445
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Join us on Sunday at the Linux Action Show 10 a.m. Pacific jblive.tv to ask your questions

1446
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
to Rob from Mangero and keep an eye on the Linux Action Show subreddit.

1447
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
We might start a thread up there with your questions but keep it civil.

1448
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:37,000
I mean I don't think you wouldn't but I'm just saying and kind of excited.

1449
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Noah, Colonel Linux and Eric and I are all heading down to OSCon.

1450
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
We'll report back.

1451
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Matt will tell you how it went and guess what?

1452
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
We decided I went for the train.

1453
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Going to ride the train down.

1454
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
I'm really looking forward to that.

1455
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
I'm excited.

1456
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Yeah we're catching the train in Seattle and it's kind of an evening one so Noah's going

1457
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,000
to pick us up in Portland like at 930 at night.

1458
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,000
But it's a three hour train ride but it's got Wi-Fi pretty much the whole way there.

1459
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:12,000
So I figure you know bring the Kindle, bring a few podcasts, work on some show notes during

1460
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,000
the drive and we'll just kind of hang out.

1461
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,000
I don't know if they're going to feed us Eric because of the time or what but we'll figure

1462
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
that out.

1463
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Yeah it's a good question.

1464
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Well yeah we'll definitely figure that out.

1465
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I'm sure they have some sort of food on board.

1466
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Yeah probably.

1467
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Yeah I imagine it's fire on board.

1468
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Most trains will have like kind of a snack cart galley type situation.

1469
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Yeah.

1470
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Yeah okay.

1471
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Bring water because otherwise you'll be paying through the nose for it.

1472
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
That's my big tip.

1473
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:38,000
So definitely bring lots of water and bring little snacks like granola bar type things.

1474
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Anything like that would do well.

1475
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Good idea.

1476
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:45,000
My tip is don't eat anything on the train and buy me dinner when you get to Portland.

1477
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
At 9.30 at night though?

1478
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
There you go.

1479
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,000
I mean I'm down for that but all right I'll have a snack.

1480
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
I'll hold me over and maybe a snack and a flask.

1481
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,000
I'll bring my flask and a granola bar and I'll be all right.

1482
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
I'll make it over the trip.

1483
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
So because of our OSCON shenanigans and of course that means we're going to come back

1484
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:06,000
with a bunch of interviews and stuff like that but because of our OSCON shenanigans

1485
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:13,000
next week we're going to record episode 50 of Linux Unplugged Monday at 1pm Pacific at

1486
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
JBLive right after Coda Radio on Monday.

1487
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,000
So the way it's going to work on Monday, Tech Talk today in the morning, Coda Radio and

1488
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,000
then Linux Unplugged immediately following Coda Radio.

1489
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:25,000
So if you normally join us for the mumble, wow look at this we have a huge room today.

1490
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:29,000
You guys please show up on Monday and hang out with us because we're going to pre-record

1491
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,000
for Tuesday so that way when we get down to OSCON we go balls to the wall, we don't have

1492
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
to worry about stopping to do a show because we'll just be getting interviews and clips.

1493
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,000
We're only there for two days so we really got to make the most out of it because Ick

1494
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:43,000
and I hop on the train to go back Wednesday afternoon so that way I can make it back here

1495
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,000
for TechSnap because you can't miss the streak of TechSnap.

1496
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,000
So we're only there for two days but if you're going to be down at OSCON or if you're in

1497
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:56,000
the Portland, Oregon area the 22nd or the 23rd tweet me at ChrisLAS or shout out in

1498
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,000
the Linux Action Show subreddit we'd love to meet up with you and shake your hand and

1499
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,000
maybe buy you a burger or a beer or something like that.

1500
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,000
So that'll be, it's going to be, you know it's perfect.

1501
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
It's perfect because it's a three hour train ride, we go down there, we get some great

1502
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:13,000
interviews for the show, we spend the night, two nights down there, we come back up.

1503
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:18,000
It's my ideal kind of coverage because you can just do it in a couple of days, you don't

1504
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
have to fly anywhere.

1505
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
That's low stress.

1506
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Yeah, low stress and Noah, you know, once again is going to be awesome and he's going

1507
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:28,000
to bring some cameras and equipment for us and hopefully he'll be wearing Google Glass.

1508
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Not for the interview.

1509
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Oh come on.

1510
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Oh gee, come on.

1511
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Everybody loves it.

1512
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Everybody loves Google Glass, right?

1513
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
I'm told it's not that popular.

1514
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Oh, that's weird.

1515
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
That's weird.

1516
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Yeah, he's got a good watch too.

1517
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
People are checking out your wares, Noah.

1518
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,000
You're becoming a bit of a celebrity, I think.

1519
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
All right, well I'll wrap us up there.

1520
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Who's got an open mic?

1521
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Rotten.

1522
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Rotten, you got an open mic there, Rotten.

1523
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Okay, so I'll leave us there.

1524
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Just want to also mention Tech Talk today.

1525
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:59,000
I do that Monday through Thursday, jblive.tv, 9 a.m. Pacific, noon Eastern.

1526
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:04,000
We often talk about Linux related stuff in the general tech news as it applies through

1527
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,000
the filter of an OS or of an open source advocate in the Linux user.

1528
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,000
So like sometimes I have a poke at Microsoft, I'll admit it, but I can't help it.

1529
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
It's in my nature.

1530
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
By the way, I think we still have a good time.

1531
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
So if you want to catch that, you can also join us live for that.

1532
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
We have our virtual lug.

1533
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
It's kind of like a technology call-in morning show.

1534
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Only instead of call-ins, we have a mumble room and it's way cooler than a call-in show

1535
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:27,000
because it's doing it like you would do it if it was the year 2014.

1536
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
So Tech Talk today, Monday through Thursday.

1537
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:34,000
And one of these days, Matt, when there's not a Fo show or something like that after

1538
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
the Linux action show, we should have thought of this.

1539
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,000
I should do a Tech Talk today with you while you're here as a prerecord.

1540
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
I should have thought of that.

1541
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Oh, that would be awesome.

1542
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Well, we'll think about it.

1543
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
We'll discuss it off air and figure out a time we can do that because it would be fun

1544
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
to have you on Tech Talk today.

1545
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
I think that would be a good time, Matt.

1546
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
That would be a good time.

1547
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
All right.

1548
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Well, I'll leave it right there, ladies and gentlemen.

1549
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Thank you so much for joining us this week on Linux Unplugged.

1553
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
for episode 50.

1554
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Fifty episodes.

1555
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Wow.

1556
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Holy cow.

1557
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
All right, Matt.

1558
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Well, I'll see you on Sunday, okay?

1559
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
All right.

1560
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
See you then.

1561
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
All right, everyone.

1562
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1563

If you don't see on Sunday for the big show, we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1564
