This is Linux Unplugged Episode 32 for March 18th, 2014.

00:30.000 --> 00:41.520
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's stockpiling bananas in preparation

00:41.520 --> 00:45.200
for this Sunday's Monkey Suit Spectacular. My name is Chris.

00:45.200 --> 00:46.200
My name is Matt.

00:46.200 --> 00:49.840
Hey there, Matt. We've got a good show lined up today. Falling right on the heels of our

00:49.840 --> 00:55.640
review of SolidXK on last, we'll be discussing the distribution with the co-founders themselves

00:55.640 --> 00:59.600
coming up in a little bit. And I don't know, I'm really conflicted because there's a lot

00:59.600 --> 01:03.120
we could talk about this week, but I also kind of have to keep it a short show because

01:03.120 --> 01:07.640
right after we get off the air, I've got to run to meet up with an electrician at the

01:07.640 --> 01:13.960
new studio. That's going down like crazy. Rekai landed yesterday. He's at the studio.

01:13.960 --> 01:18.540
He's actually getting goodies right now to get ready in preparation to prepare his body

01:18.540 --> 01:23.120
for editing of these shows. So he's got to have sustenance. So Angelo's out with him

01:23.120 --> 01:26.920
right now taking care of all that. It's been a pretty crazy couple of days driving back

01:26.920 --> 01:31.280
and forth with a lot of gear. And so one of the other things I have to do for all the

01:31.280 --> 01:35.400
studio shenanigans is meet with the electrician. I've got to start up a new conversation with

01:35.400 --> 01:40.520
a new contractor. I know why contractors have a bad name now, Matt. Let me tell you.

01:40.520 --> 01:44.120
Well yeah, I'll tell you. There's a lot of back and forth. Although I will give a shout

01:44.120 --> 01:47.480
out to your previous contractor. He did kind of have some life circumstances.

01:47.480 --> 01:52.360
That's true. What are you going to do, right? The universe is a cruel place sometimes.

01:52.360 --> 01:56.480
But nonetheless, we're going to just go for as long as we can and get as much covered

01:56.480 --> 01:59.800
as we can today because there's been some interesting developments even just since Sunday

01:59.800 --> 02:04.120
that I want to discuss. And I'm really looking forward to talking to the Solida XK guys.

02:04.120 --> 02:08.440
So stay tuned for all of that stuff. But first, I thought maybe we'd cover a little feedback

02:08.440 --> 02:15.080
and see if we can't solve a Mac user's problems. Yes, that's right. Because he wants to switch

02:15.080 --> 02:20.960
to Linux. We should also tease, in case we forget later in the show, this Sunday on the

02:20.960 --> 02:27.200
Linux action show. It is monkey suit time. The bet comes due this Sunday. Now, for those

02:27.200 --> 02:31.720
of you that don't remember, Matt made a bet, and he's willing to pay up, that Mir would

02:31.720 --> 02:37.480
ship on another distribution outside of Ubuntu within a year, and it didn't happen. Now,

02:37.480 --> 02:40.640
I think some folks at Canonical at the time probably agreed with Matt.

02:40.640 --> 02:46.360
Oh yeah. I won't say there were promises because that's not fair, but I will absolutely say

02:46.360 --> 02:48.480
that support was given on my behalf.

02:48.480 --> 02:55.280
They said they would do their best, but it just didn't work out. But we'll just use the

02:55.280 --> 03:00.040
opportunity to kind of just look at the state of Mir development, alternative display managers

03:00.040 --> 03:03.480
on Linux, and if everything goes as planned, we'll have Kevin on from Canonical to talk

03:03.480 --> 03:07.900
a little bit about the state of Mir. So I think we're going to have monkey suit shenanigans,

03:07.900 --> 03:11.520
we're going to have a good conversation around where all of it's at a year later. So it'll

03:11.520 --> 03:15.720
work out to be a great episode coming up on Sunday. But why don't we start by seeing if

03:15.720 --> 03:20.120
we can help out Simon's problems here. Simon really wants to switch from the Mac. He says,

03:20.120 --> 03:23.880
hey there Chris and Matt. I'm a web developer and a Mac user, and I feel it's time to move

03:23.880 --> 03:30.520
on. I feel that Apple is focusing more and more on their iOS platform and losing sight

03:30.520 --> 03:35.240
of its desktop power users. I'm not blaming them. That's where the money is. I get that.

03:35.240 --> 03:38.440
But that's not the computer experience I'm looking for.

03:38.440 --> 03:41.780
I have some experiences with Linux, both on the server and on some older desktop machines

03:41.780 --> 03:47.040
here at home. But I want to go all in and use Linux on my desktop, the machine I need

03:47.040 --> 03:51.880
nine hours a day to get my work done. But now I need some help from you guys. What distribution

03:51.880 --> 03:56.260
should I go for? I'm tempted to go with Ubuntu as I feel it might make the switch easier

03:56.260 --> 04:00.560
for me. He says maybe I can even replace an iPhone with an Ubuntu touch device down the

04:00.560 --> 04:05.040
road when it's ready. It's close to the Mac user experience and might be the smoothest

04:05.040 --> 04:09.360
transition without preventing myself from getting any real work done. Later I learned

04:09.360 --> 04:13.240
the pros and cons. Maybe I could switch to a different distro at that point. But with

04:13.240 --> 04:16.920
most Linux users, they don't seem to like Ubuntu. Lots of you complain about Unity

04:16.920 --> 04:20.760
and Mir, but no one likes to explain why. What's up with that? It's simply a matter

04:20.760 --> 04:25.120
of personal taste? Is it envy because of canonical success? Is that the reason for the hate?

04:25.120 --> 04:27.360
Thanks for helping me choose. Simon.

04:27.360 --> 04:31.400
Boy, you know, I think the first question I would have to ask him is what is he using

04:31.400 --> 04:35.520
for web development? Are there legacy applications at work that could potentially create a bit

04:35.520 --> 04:39.000
of a hurdle making the switch completely? Now, if he's just doing this straight from

04:39.000 --> 04:41.320
like a notepad or something like that, no big deal.

04:41.320 --> 04:44.280
Yeah, he said web developer. So I'm going to just give him the benefit of the doubt

04:44.280 --> 04:48.280
that, you know, he could probably he'd maybe he's using a sublime text on the Mac. He could

04:48.280 --> 04:49.560
use sublime text on Linux.

04:49.560 --> 04:52.480
Sure. Okay. So let's say he's going that route. I think he's going that route. I think Ubuntu

04:52.480 --> 04:59.200
does make sense simply because it does feel very natural to a lot of Mac users. My wife,

04:59.200 --> 05:02.480
if she's going to use Linux, will generally prefer Ubuntu simply because she finds the

05:02.480 --> 05:07.680
flow is more familiar to her. Generally speaking, compared to other distros, although she's

05:07.680 --> 05:10.920
pretty comfortable in most distributions, it's really not such an issue with that. And

05:10.920 --> 05:16.000
I also think the App Store coming from the Mac also then going to Ubuntu is also fairly

05:16.000 --> 05:23.120
familiar in that regard as well. What do you think as far as hatred, though?

05:23.120 --> 05:30.480
What about the idea of making his Linux desktop match whatever web server platform he's deploying

05:30.480 --> 05:35.280
on? So if he's deploying on a CentOS box, maybe Fedora might make more sense or CentOS

05:35.280 --> 05:39.000
is enough, maybe? I can't think of very many situations where

05:39.000 --> 05:43.620
a newcomer in Fedora would ever fit the same sentence. I think Fedora is a great distro,

05:43.620 --> 05:49.840
but it is not. And anyway, I couldn't picture that unless it's maintained for them and then

05:49.840 --> 05:50.840
that's different.

05:50.840 --> 05:53.680
What do you think, Mumble Room? So you got a Mac user. He's a web developer. His name

05:53.680 --> 05:59.320
is Simon and he's thinking about switching from the Mac to Linux. What distro would you

05:59.320 --> 06:01.520
say he should pick?

06:01.520 --> 06:09.600
I think something very similar. I came from Mac to Linux, and I felt very comfortable

06:09.600 --> 06:12.040
at the time with Unity on Ubuntu.

06:12.040 --> 06:19.280
It really depends on what sort of workflow he's desiring. If he's desiring a Mac-like

06:19.280 --> 06:24.960
workflow, I'd almost recommend elementary OS, and therefore maybe GDK.

06:24.960 --> 06:25.960
Please no.

06:25.960 --> 06:27.960
Ouch, wow.

06:27.960 --> 06:31.680
Their packages are so out of date that it's not worth using them.

06:31.680 --> 06:34.120
They're based on a stable 12.0 for LTS.

06:34.120 --> 06:38.600
Right. If they just updated their packages, that'd be fine. They update the security stuff,

06:38.600 --> 06:44.440
but they don't update any of their packages. For example, my app hasn't been updated in

06:44.440 --> 06:50.040
Ubuntu for like two years. So by default, the package in elementary is also two years

06:50.040 --> 06:51.040
old.

06:51.040 --> 06:58.520
There will probably be an update when the new LTS comes next month.

06:58.520 --> 07:10.880
I'd probably recommend Ubuntu, maybe. Partly because it's awesome, but partly because with

07:10.880 --> 07:16.800
the LTS just around the corner, he'll get a nice shiny new kernel, long-term support,

07:16.800 --> 07:19.680
and every app he needs, basically.

07:19.680 --> 07:25.400
To be fair, I think the hate against Ubuntu is purely Unity and pretty much preferences.

07:25.400 --> 07:29.320
I don't like the Dash, but everything else in Unity I like. The local menus, it's in

07:29.320 --> 07:30.320
14.04. Awesome.

07:30.320 --> 07:36.560
Okay, so he could get the benefit of having the kernel and switch and use XFCE or Gnome

07:36.560 --> 07:41.160
Shell or any one of a bazillion other desktops that are all in the repository. You don't

07:41.160 --> 07:47.840
have to switch to show some random distribution from some guy in his bedroom. You could use

07:47.840 --> 07:51.160
Ubuntu and just not use Unity if you don't want to. That's fine.

07:51.160 --> 07:55.600
I think he should just try out some different distros, maybe start with Ubuntu and just

07:55.600 --> 07:58.760
see what he likes because we're not going to be able to...

07:58.760 --> 08:00.960
You're saying Linux from scratch? Is that what you're saying?

08:00.960 --> 08:08.080
I think he was saying Gentoo. I think I would recommend SolidXK. That's what I would recommend.

08:08.080 --> 08:10.480
Seriously, that might be worth consideration.

08:10.480 --> 08:15.080
The other thing I want to recommend to Simon is he said that in his letter, he said that

08:15.080 --> 08:18.560
he's got some older machines that he's had some experience with Linux on, both a server

08:18.560 --> 08:25.060
and an older desktop machine. I would not recommend you say switch from a relatively

08:25.060 --> 08:31.440
recent MacBook Pro to a several-year-old PC machine and load Linux on it and experience...

08:31.440 --> 08:34.480
You're not going to have a great experience because you're going from pretty high-end

08:34.480 --> 08:39.960
hardware to lower-end hardware. So give Linux a chance to breathe. If you're used to...

08:39.960 --> 08:42.720
If you work at a machine, like you said, for nine hours a day to get work done and you're

08:42.720 --> 08:48.840
used to that machine being very powerful, then don't limit yourself with a resource-limited

08:48.840 --> 08:53.400
machine just because that's the one you can load Linux on. So position your hardware correctly.

08:53.400 --> 08:58.760
Try out some different distributions. Try Integros. Try Solid. Try Ubuntu. Try SUSE.

08:58.760 --> 09:03.540
Try all of them, really. I'm betting like the most of the chat room, you might end up

09:03.540 --> 09:05.720
liking the more recent Ubuntu versions.

09:05.720 --> 09:10.000
Yeah. Well, and I go back to what I said about the user interface. For a lot of Mac users,

09:10.000 --> 09:14.440
that's a big deal. And I think Ubuntu nails a pretty close match for my experience.

09:14.440 --> 09:18.280
Yeah. Yeah. Gnome 3 is pretty refined these days, too.

09:18.280 --> 09:21.560
Yeah. Gnome 3 is okay. Gnome 3 would be all right. I could see that, especially with a

09:21.560 --> 09:22.560
little dock action going on.

09:22.560 --> 09:28.240
Yeah, a little dock action. But I just say, just try it out. And like you said, it sounds

09:28.240 --> 09:32.120
like you're pretty open to the idea of moving later on. The Ubuntu hate kind of just comes

09:32.120 --> 09:35.080
from... There's a lot there. You basically... Just listen to the back catalog of the show

09:35.080 --> 09:37.000
and it'll actually explain it pretty well.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.560
Yeah. Listen to that last one episode.

09:38.560 --> 09:42.520
Yeah. Listen to the last episode. Exactly. That actually covered it pretty well. And

09:42.520 --> 09:44.880
I think that if you're comfortable with the things I discussed there, and I think you

09:44.880 --> 09:49.680
probably would be, like we got an email from a viewer who said, you know, I'm long time...

09:49.680 --> 09:54.040
Actually, I think I have it in the pile here. I'll see if we can get to it. Because I think

09:54.040 --> 09:59.160
I do have an email from... Yeah. We have an email from somebody who's going to touch on

09:59.160 --> 10:02.120
that. So we'll get to that in a minute because I think there's a lot of people who just don't

10:02.120 --> 10:05.400
care about some of the things that get people all riled up. And then there's a lot of advantages

10:05.400 --> 10:09.680
to Ubuntu. There's a lot of advantages to all of them. Try them out, Simon. Keep listening.

10:09.680 --> 10:12.560
Check out our back catalog. I think that'll give you some help. But the big piece I wanted

10:12.560 --> 10:17.960
you to take away from my recommendation is don't straddle yourself with lower end hardware

10:17.960 --> 10:22.520
and then expect to be blown away. You're not going to have a bad time necessarily, especially

10:22.520 --> 10:29.840
if you go with something like Popey was saying with XFCE or Solid X. But you probably won't

10:29.840 --> 10:34.520
need the same amount of hardware. But I am somebody who's very sensitive to low performance

10:34.520 --> 10:43.160
hardware. And if I had a MacBook Pro with 16 gigabytes of RAM, an SSD, and a high end

10:43.160 --> 10:47.920
video card, and then I switched to something with a spinning drive, maybe an integrated

10:47.920 --> 10:52.840
GPU, and a core to do or something like that, I don't think I would use that machine very

10:52.840 --> 10:56.880
long. And I think I would have a pretty bad time. And I think that would influence my

10:56.880 --> 11:01.040
opinion of that operating system in general. Because it just would feel restrictive.

11:01.040 --> 11:05.520
Well, it's an excellent point. The bigger point of it is, too, is that I don't care

11:05.520 --> 11:10.200
what version of Linux you're using, what distro you happen to go with. If you're using a lot

11:10.200 --> 11:13.400
of resources, such as like a browser with a bunch of tabs open, you're going to care

11:13.400 --> 11:17.360
about the hardware it's running on. Really, you can run lightweight desktops all day long.

11:17.360 --> 11:22.640
I also agree with Ayamakan in the chat room. I'm not a big proponent of putting Linux on

11:22.640 --> 11:27.760
a Mac. You can do it. But there are always compromises. And people who tell you there

11:27.760 --> 11:30.040
aren't compromises haven't been running it long enough.

11:30.040 --> 11:31.040
Or all.

11:31.040 --> 11:37.360
Yeah, it's just, unfortunately, it is the truth. Like for example, whenever I had tried

11:37.360 --> 11:43.360
it on a Mac, I've always had issues with the webcam. There's a blob that you have to load

11:43.360 --> 11:48.840
up at the time of boot up that you have to... I guess the Mac operating system actually

11:48.840 --> 11:54.840
loads like a firmware onto the webcam every time Mac OS X starts. And you have to replicate

11:54.840 --> 11:59.360
that under Linux. And you have to go extract that firmware out of a Mac, move it over to

11:59.360 --> 12:04.680
your Linux install, and then, you know, follow some sort of guide online to make that work.

12:04.680 --> 12:10.800
There's other things that don't work. Like on more recent, like say, 2012 Retina MacBook

12:10.800 --> 12:14.360
Pro, I'm reading a discussion thread here that was a really good one on Reddit over

12:14.360 --> 12:18.520
the last weekend. Wi-Fi is extremely flaky for this guy. He says he doesn't have any

12:18.520 --> 12:22.280
problem under Mavericks, but when he's under Linux, his Wi-Fi drops out. Reduced battery

12:22.280 --> 12:28.440
life. Under Linux, he gets 4.5 hours compared to 8 hours under OS X. Once the video and

12:28.440 --> 12:32.940
video blob loads, he's unable to switch to one of the TTYs, you know, by doing Control

12:32.940 --> 12:38.840
Alt and hitting F1 or F2 or F3. He says the touchpad is extremely quirky. He says I've

12:38.840 --> 12:41.840
ironed it out as well as I can, but I'm still not completely happy with it, particularly

12:41.840 --> 12:45.480
when typing from the web like this one. A little more than just a slightest touch or

12:45.480 --> 12:49.360
reposition of my typing cursor and the position of the mouse cursor. It can be infuriating

12:49.360 --> 12:53.080
at times. He says I've had to reread this exact post three times just to make sure I'm

12:53.080 --> 12:58.680
catching the errors that this one single issue has caused. So don't necessarily load it on

12:58.680 --> 13:02.800
a Mac and expect it to work well. Different Macs have different success rates. Generally

13:02.800 --> 13:07.640
the newer the Mac, the less things that work. So also consider that, Simon. You might want

13:07.640 --> 13:13.840
to consider a dedicated machine that's really, you know, going to give you a better experience.

13:13.840 --> 13:17.400
And if this was Linux Action Show, I'd say go over to check out System76 because they're

13:17.400 --> 13:22.360
going to give you a Mac-like experience as far as hardware compatibility and setup. Something

13:22.360 --> 13:26.120
to consider. I will mention one of Linux Unplug sponsors right here, right now, and that's

13:26.120 --> 13:30.620
my mobile service provider and, by the way, Matt's mobile service provider. That's right.

13:30.620 --> 13:36.640
That is Ting.com. You guys, go check out Ting. Mobile that makes sense. Go to Linux.Ting.com.

13:36.640 --> 13:40.960
Linux.Ting.com. That'll get you started. That landing page will also tag your shopping session

13:40.960 --> 13:45.800
to take $25 off your first device or if you're going to bring your own device, $25 service

13:45.800 --> 13:50.240
credit, which for me paid for my first month. Now what's unique about Ting? I'll tell you.

13:50.240 --> 13:55.400
You only pay for what you use. It's a flat $6 per month plus taxes and then just your

13:55.400 --> 13:59.480
usage. It's really straight. Like you can wrap your brain around that and which is great

13:59.480 --> 14:02.880
because like, hey, guess what? I needed hotspot and tethering over the last few weeks when

14:02.880 --> 14:06.680
I was working out of the studio for a few hours. I just checked the box on my phone

14:06.680 --> 14:10.560
and now all the devices that we had with us were immediately on the internet and I'm getting

14:10.560 --> 14:16.380
14 megabits download at the studio using my Nexus 5. Oh yeah, they support the Nexus 5.

14:16.380 --> 14:21.000
You can go buy the Nexus 5 directly from the Google Play Store, a device that you own outright

14:21.000 --> 14:26.440
that you pay a fair market price, you bring it over to Ting, you activate it, $6 a month,

14:26.440 --> 14:31.500
no contract, no early termination fee. You only pay for what you use. Plus Ting has an

14:31.500 --> 14:36.240
awesome, awesome dashboard. I love this dashboard because I was just setting up Reiki in the

14:36.240 --> 14:43.480
new studio with the HTC One. Oh, it hurt. I gave away the HTC One, Matt. It pained me

14:43.480 --> 14:46.760
so deeply. That was the hardest phone I've ever had to give away. I've given away a lot

14:46.760 --> 14:51.320
of phones and the HTC One, cut deep. That's a great phone. It's available on the Ting

14:51.320 --> 14:56.480
network and what's so nice about it is that Ting dashboard now lets me manage these accounts

14:56.480 --> 15:01.880
so transparently and smoothly. I can let them see where they're at with their usage. I can

15:01.880 --> 15:05.240
set up alerts so if all of a sudden Reiki is using like 10 gigabytes of data on that

15:05.240 --> 15:10.640
phone, I can have Ting send me a push notification to my Android app. I can log into their dashboard

15:10.640 --> 15:15.280
which supports web standards from a mobile device or from your desktop, whatever it is.

15:15.280 --> 15:20.440
I can set up caller IDs options. I can turn off voicemail. I can turn on voicemail. I

15:20.440 --> 15:26.200
can set up where a call forwards. I can activate, deactivate lines, transfer lines, set up account

15:26.200 --> 15:31.200
managers. It's all, it's so awesome and it's so smooth and here's the best part. If you've

15:31.200 --> 15:34.660
been considering switching to Ting and you're stuck in a contract, Ting has an early termination

15:34.660 --> 15:40.240
relief program. You can find out more going to ting.com slash ETF and that early termination

15:40.240 --> 15:44.040
relief program will pay you up to $75 per line you have to have canceled. And the other

15:44.040 --> 15:47.400
thing I like about Ting is I like to be an informed consumer. I like to make sure that

15:47.400 --> 15:50.740
I am voting with my wallet, that the money I am spending is going towards a company that

15:50.740 --> 15:55.400
is promoting something that I believe in. Ting is trying to clean up the wireless industry.

15:55.400 --> 15:58.400
They're trying to shake things up and I think they're doing it successfully. You're seeing

15:58.400 --> 16:02.580
some of the bigger players try to copy what they're doing but it's not genuine. Ting is

16:02.580 --> 16:06.760
genuine and they put it all out there. You can go over to ting.com slash about and you

16:06.760 --> 16:12.280
can get videos from just the top, the CEO, the EVP, the VP, the director right there,

16:12.280 --> 16:17.600
VP of marketing, the CFO. They also have behind the scenes tours with just the service reps,

16:17.600 --> 16:21.440
the people who are on the ground because they have a fantastic customer service program.

16:21.440 --> 16:25.920
When you call them anytime between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. a real person answers the phone.

16:25.920 --> 16:28.920
I don't know of any other cell provider that does that. If you're in a business, if you've

16:28.920 --> 16:32.780
got family or friends or even if you just need to solve a problem yourself, it is so

16:32.780 --> 16:38.440
nice to know that when I handed Rekai that HTC One and if we had a problem at any point,

16:38.440 --> 16:41.160
I knew that I would just call up Ting and we'd have it resolved within a few minutes.

16:41.160 --> 16:45.320
It wasn't going to be a big waste of my time. Lately, a lot of people that I've had to deal

16:45.320 --> 16:48.380
with over the phone have been wasting my time. It is so great to know that people that I'm

16:48.380 --> 16:52.640
spending money on every single month for my mobile phone are not wasting my time. Ting

16:52.640 --> 16:56.960
really is changing it up and you can help them do it by becoming a Ting subscriber.

16:56.960 --> 17:01.780
Go over to linux.ting.com. That'll take $25 off your first month or $25 off your first

17:01.780 --> 17:05.360
device if you don't have one and it also lets them know you heard about it here on this

17:05.360 --> 17:10.120
show and you appreciate them supporting Linux Unplugged. So go over to linux.ting.com and

17:10.120 --> 17:14.720
a really big thank you to the really great folks over at Ting for their awesome support

17:14.720 --> 17:22.760
of Linux Unplugged. Linux.ting.com. Alright, we've got a couple more emails to get through.

17:22.760 --> 17:27.400
Last week, we asked for folks to send in their AutoCAD replacements because this is something

17:27.400 --> 17:31.720
we hear about all the time. I can't switch to Linux because AutoCAD and it seems to be

17:31.720 --> 17:37.280
a lot of people in this field are interested in Linux but AutoCAD. So Scribbleton writes

17:37.280 --> 17:42.760
in. He says, hello awesome duo. He actually wrote that. So that made it right there. He

17:42.760 --> 17:47.480
tells us about DraftSight. It's a professional grade and free as a beard 2D CAD program made

17:47.480 --> 17:51.640
by the same company that produces SolidWorks. Okay, now SolidWorks I've heard a lot about.

17:51.640 --> 17:57.040
They introduced it as a way for engineers to convert AutoCAD DWG files to DXF files

17:57.040 --> 18:01.840
although I think they're also trying to steal some of AutoCAD's market share. It behaves so

18:01.840 --> 18:06.920
much like AutoCAD it even uses the same command lines that a coworker and I completely switched

18:06.920 --> 18:11.600
over in just a matter of days. It runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux and it can be found

18:11.600 --> 18:16.960
at draftsite.com. He said, I also have a comment after watching Linux Unplugged 31, the Ubuntu

18:16.960 --> 18:21.680
punching bag episode that we just recommended Simon listen to. He says, I'm not a programmer,

18:21.680 --> 18:26.560
a dev, or an IT guy. I'm just an average user that loves to use Linux. Yet I have not

18:26.560 --> 18:31.080
missed an episode of last since I found it in 2011. As a small business owner, I watched

18:31.080 --> 18:35.760
last to keep up with Linux developments and learn about new programs. As you were discussing,

18:35.760 --> 18:39.880
I don't care about the internal battles of Wayland versus mirror system D. I just want

18:39.880 --> 18:44.880
my stuff to run as simply and reliably as possible so I can get my work done. So Ubuntu

18:44.880 --> 18:50.400
has worked just fine for me. Someday I may want to try Antegoros, but only after I find

18:50.400 --> 18:54.240
some spare time. Keep up the good work. I'm really looking forward to the new how to show

18:54.240 --> 18:58.960
so an average guy like me can effectively implement all this great stuff. Scribbleton.

18:58.960 --> 19:02.800
Great comment and I think he echoes a lot of the silent majority there. That's why I

19:02.800 --> 19:08.920
wanted to read it. I think he's definitely onto something. So Esquero Tamero writes in

19:08.920 --> 19:16.240
Matt. I don't know how you say it. He's got a whole list for us, Matt. He says, I used

19:16.240 --> 19:19.920
to do drafting for my family's business, civil engineering related, and I tried some of the

19:19.920 --> 19:24.360
solutions a while back while trying to find a cheaper alternative to AutoCAD. I haven't

19:24.360 --> 19:28.400
used all of these solutions, but they're all present for Linux and they're related to CAD.

19:28.400 --> 19:33.200
He says, here's one you could try. FreeCAD. This is an application used to 3D models.

19:33.200 --> 19:38.280
LibreCAD. This is basically a fork of the community edition of QCAD. BLRCAD. Haven't

19:38.280 --> 19:42.720
used this one, but he says it's another option. QCAD. This is a program with a free and paid

19:42.720 --> 19:46.300
version. And then he says there's commercial software like DraftSite, which we just had

19:46.300 --> 19:52.440
recommended to us. VeryCAD, a 2D, 3D CAD program. Eris Commander Edition. This is a compatible

19:52.440 --> 19:57.200
2D, 3D CAD program with a ribbon interface. And BricsCAD. This is probably the most complete

19:57.200 --> 20:04.400
solution for Linux, along with Eris CE, but it's as expensive as AutoCAD. And it seems

20:04.400 --> 20:07.320
to stumble on 64-bit systems, he says.

20:07.320 --> 20:10.880
Hmm. Now that could be a problem. I mean, you would think, okay, I can just go ahead

20:10.880 --> 20:14.720
and switch over to this, but I think so many people are using 64-bit systems. That would

20:14.720 --> 20:15.720
be kind of a buzzkill.

20:15.720 --> 20:20.480
It also says DWGs are not exactly supported in FOSS software. As far as I know, support

20:20.480 --> 20:25.920
is limited, and there are GPL compliance issues incorporated into other programs.

20:25.920 --> 20:30.280
This is a good list, and I wanted to say thank you for sending this in. It feels a little

20:30.280 --> 20:35.920
bit like the list I get when I ask people for their favorite Linux video editor, and

20:35.920 --> 20:39.960
then I get a list of a lot of really good options with links and names, but then I actually

20:39.960 --> 20:44.040
go sit down and I'm like, oh, well, when you actually use these programs professionally,

20:44.040 --> 20:47.640
you discover a lot of limitations. And I kind of feel like this might be a little bit of

20:47.640 --> 20:48.640
that.

20:48.640 --> 20:49.640
I think so.

20:49.640 --> 20:53.920
It's hard to say, so we will link. We'll have a full list in our show notes. You can

20:53.920 --> 20:57.880
go check out. It sounds like the one people are really going on about, though, is DraftSight

20:57.880 --> 21:03.400
from, I guess, the same folks that make SolidWorks. And DraftSight is, technically, it's free,

21:03.400 --> 21:08.020
as in cost, but it is commercial software. It's not open source. And they have it available

21:08.020 --> 21:12.720
for Windows, Mac, and Linux. They have an RPM for Fedora available.

21:12.720 --> 21:16.560
Okay. Well, I think anytime you have something available for Linux, even if it's not perfect,

21:16.560 --> 21:17.560
at least it's there.

21:17.560 --> 21:18.560
They have a dev as well. They have a dev.

21:18.560 --> 21:19.560
Okay.

21:19.560 --> 21:24.800
So you got a couple options there. So that's DraftSight. And hopefully, that helps some

21:24.800 --> 21:28.680
folks out there that have been looking for AutoCAD solutions, because it's been a surprisingly

21:28.680 --> 21:35.400
popular one. Art of Illusion. What's this? Art of Illusion is a free open source remodeling

21:35.400 --> 21:36.640
and rendering studio.

21:36.640 --> 21:37.640
Oh, okay.

21:37.640 --> 21:38.640
Oh, wow.

21:38.640 --> 21:41.400
Many of its capabilities rival those found in commercial programs. So here's another

21:41.400 --> 21:45.080
one. Art of Illusion. I'll add that to the show notes, too. Thanks, Nexuiz. That's a

21:45.080 --> 21:46.080
good one.

21:46.080 --> 21:47.080
Yeah.

21:47.080 --> 21:52.000
So, all right. I'm adding that, right? There we go. So thanks for sending those in, guys.

21:52.000 --> 21:56.360
That was a good list. We had a few folks round up. We also got four or five emails on it

21:56.360 --> 22:00.920
as well. And so I just linked to a couple of them, but we got a lot of good feedback

22:00.920 --> 22:03.880
on it. So I really appreciate all of you guys sending that in to us.

22:03.880 --> 22:06.920
Matt, before we get our guests on, I want to thank our second sponsor this week, and

22:06.920 --> 22:11.680
that is DigitalOcean. What is DigitalOcean? Oh, man. You guys have got to check this out.

22:11.680 --> 22:14.800
If you're thinking about learning how to do something on the server, if you have something

22:14.800 --> 22:18.520
you need to deploy in production, you've got to check out DigitalOcean. It's simple cloud

22:18.520 --> 22:23.200
hosting dedicated to offering the most intuitive way and easy way to spin up a cloud server.

22:23.200 --> 22:28.240
Users can create a cloud server in 55 seconds, or less if you're our audience, and pricing

22:28.240 --> 22:33.720
plans are only $5 per month for 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, and a terabyte

22:33.720 --> 22:37.320
of transfer. I've got an arch box I've had running up there. Yes, I said arch, running

22:37.320 --> 22:43.520
up there for months now, and it's just constantly doing more and more stuff. And as I am moving

22:43.520 --> 22:47.680
between the current studio and the new studio, and I start thinking about, well, wait a minute,

22:47.680 --> 22:52.880
I need to have shared resources between these two locations. I got to tell you, this $5

22:52.880 --> 22:56.760
DigitalOcean machine, it's just starting to get more and more valuable, because I just

22:56.760 --> 23:00.880
keep thinking of things I can do with it. And by the way, DigitalOcean has data center

23:00.880 --> 23:06.940
locations in New York, San Francisco, Amsterdam, and now they've even got them in Singapore.

23:06.940 --> 23:10.880
They have a very simple interface, an intuitive control panel, which power users can replicate

23:10.880 --> 23:15.640
on a larger scale with the company's straightforward API. They got KVM on the back end, it's all

23:15.640 --> 23:20.600
running on top of Linux, sitting on these SSDs, in pair with their tier one bandwidth.

23:20.600 --> 23:24.160
And the reason I can say all of this is because I've been a DigitalOcean customer for a long

23:24.160 --> 23:29.280
time now, and I have not had a single outage. I have never, ever been disappointed with

23:29.280 --> 23:33.520
the performance, and I am constantly impressed with the feature sets and the things they're

23:33.520 --> 23:36.920
adding. And DigitalOcean is a company. They are growing like crazy. They're hiring right

23:36.920 --> 23:40.840
now. You can check out their hiring page. They have it linked at the top of the DigitalOcean

23:40.840 --> 23:44.560
website. They just recently got a good round of funding too, so they've got a ton of runway

23:44.560 --> 23:48.480
underneath them. This is a company that is going places, and I'm really excited because

23:48.480 --> 23:52.520
not only is that all great, but it's just a really great service to use. The technology

23:52.520 --> 23:58.000
is great, the interface is great, their droplet system is super smooth and straightforward,

23:58.000 --> 24:01.960
and they have an API that if I ever wanted to get fancy, and I ever wanted to do something

24:01.960 --> 24:06.200
like start automating stuff, I know that API is there to make it easy for me. So go over

24:06.200 --> 24:12.000
to DigitalOcean.com and get a $10 credit by using the promo code Linux Unplugged March.

24:12.000 --> 24:16.740
Linux Unplugged March will get you a $10 credit. You can try out that $5 rig for two months.

24:16.740 --> 24:20.760
Try out that $5 rig. Even if you're just using it to explore what you can do on your own

24:20.760 --> 24:25.240
server, why not use this instead of something like VirtualBox? Go up there, deploy this.

24:25.240 --> 24:29.440
You can take snapshots before you break anything. Yes, it actually, in a sense, can have training

24:29.440 --> 24:33.720
wheels. That droplet system can really help you get out of a jam, and it also helps you

24:33.720 --> 24:39.360
deploy a new system immediately. My co-host from Koda Radio, Michael Dominic, uses DigitalOcean

24:39.360 --> 24:43.320
for the backend infrastructure for a lot of the apps he develops for his clients. It's

24:43.320 --> 24:47.760
a super easy system to deploy. He can do it with reliability. He can quantify the cost

24:47.760 --> 24:51.320
for them. They can totally wrap their brains around it, and $5 a month doesn't break the

24:51.320 --> 24:57.000
bank. They have a really straightforward pricing system where it goes from $5, $10, $20, $40,

24:57.000 --> 25:01.880
$80, depending on what you need. Each tier brings a whole bunch more stuff, more processor,

25:01.880 --> 25:07.240
more storage, more bandwidth, all of that stuff. If you just want to do some testing,

25:07.240 --> 25:09.760
maybe you've got a web app you want to try out, maybe you've got an app that needs some

25:09.760 --> 25:13.140
backend infrastructure for a little bit, but you don't need it for an entire month, they

25:13.140 --> 25:18.840
even have hourly pricing. DigitalOcean has hourly pricing. Think about that $10 credit

25:18.840 --> 25:23.820
at that point. That $10 credit is going to get you a ways. Go use the promo code LINUXUNPLUGGEDMARCH

25:23.820 --> 25:28.200
when you check out over at digitalocean.com. Try out that $5 machine. See what we've been

25:28.200 --> 25:33.520
saying, and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

25:33.520 --> 25:36.440
That's awesome. What you were saying about the whole virtual machine thing, that really

25:36.440 --> 25:40.160
resonates with me because I don't always have a machine handy that can really support that

25:40.160 --> 25:44.080
as well as I could at virtual, going to a whole other setup.

25:44.080 --> 25:47.840
There's that. There's the resources of it. If you're on a laptop, it makes your laptop

25:47.840 --> 25:53.520
run hot. There's all these reasons, and you don't have the performance drag, plus you're

25:53.520 --> 25:57.880
actually up on the web where you can try some things you might not be comfortable bringing

25:57.880 --> 26:02.800
into your house, and you have that droplet system, so if you mess something up, boop,

26:02.800 --> 26:05.560
Bob's your uncle, you revert right back, just like you would on VirtualBox.

26:05.560 --> 26:11.960
All right. Well, I'm really excited to welcome the co-founders of SolidXK onto the show.

26:11.960 --> 26:17.820
I'm going to try to get this right. We have Shilja and 00. I don't know how well I did

26:17.820 --> 26:19.760
but guys, welcome to the show.

26:19.760 --> 26:24.000
Thank you very much, and happy to be here.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
Hello.

26:25.000 --> 26:29.600
Hello, 00. We were pretty impressed by the distro when we checked it out on Sunday, so

26:29.600 --> 26:32.840
I just had a couple of questions after we kicked the tires that I wanted to throw your

26:32.840 --> 26:38.120
guys' way. What I'm going to do is I'll just go in the order, so I'll start with Shilja,

26:38.120 --> 26:41.680
and then we'll ask 00, or you guys can just bounce it around, but let's throw this first

26:41.680 --> 26:46.920
one to Shilja. Could you guys give us a little background? Is SolidXK based on Linux Mint

26:46.920 --> 26:51.440
Debian Edition? Is it just inspired by Linux Mint Debian Edition? We noticed that it uses

26:51.440 --> 26:56.120
the Mint tools, such as the Mint Software Manager and the Mint Updater, but is it actually

26:56.120 --> 27:01.560
like, did you clone the Linux Mint distro repos and build on top of it, or did you start

27:01.560 --> 27:04.240
with a Debian base and just pull in those tools?

27:04.240 --> 27:07.840
We just started from scratch from Debian.

27:07.840 --> 27:08.840
Okay.

27:08.840 --> 27:15.840
At that time, I wanted an L&D version.

27:15.840 --> 27:20.240
Right, right. Go ahead.

27:20.240 --> 27:25.400
And Kleiner Lefebvre didn't have any plans for that.

27:25.400 --> 27:30.560
So you decided to break off on your own and create one sort of based around the same ideas

27:30.560 --> 27:34.600
of Linux Mint Debian, but with the desktops that you had a passion about?

27:34.600 --> 27:44.280
Yes, yes. And at first, we planned to make it an official version of Linux Mint. The

27:44.280 --> 27:57.280
Mint team didn't want to support that. My choice was just an edition, or go on my own.

27:57.280 --> 28:04.480
ZeroZero was also very in favor of going on our own, so we did.

28:04.480 --> 28:08.400
Very good. And ZeroZero, I wanted to, let me ask you this question. So could you explain

28:08.400 --> 28:14.040
to me the difference between the business and home versions of SolidXK? I know that

28:14.040 --> 28:18.080
the business, for example, says it has a focus on stability and security, but the home version

28:18.080 --> 28:24.720
says it's stable and secure. So what really is the difference between those two?

28:24.720 --> 28:34.600
The business edition, it's based on the Debian stable, and the home edition, it's based on

28:34.600 --> 28:44.620
Debian testing. That is the main difference. So then we build the business edition based

28:44.620 --> 28:58.320
on stable with our tools and with our interface, with our ideas, and we give the home edition

28:58.320 --> 29:10.240
with the latest software and more up-to-date software. So they are two different concepts

29:10.240 --> 29:12.760
that we give to the users.

29:12.760 --> 29:18.660
So I gather that you guys both have an interest in KDE and XFCE, but we got a couple of questions

29:18.660 --> 29:26.000
that came in primarily around the Cinnamon desktop. How does the support look for Cinnamon

29:26.000 --> 29:29.840
desktop on SolidXK? Does it use it? So do you guys have like a repo that you're going

29:29.840 --> 29:33.160
to set that up in? Are you going to just pull it from Debian, or is that something you're

29:33.160 --> 29:37.520
not really even worrying about if the users want to figure it out, they can?

29:37.520 --> 29:46.080
We're not planning on supporting Cinnamon on SolidXK. That's because the name SolidXK

29:46.080 --> 29:53.560
does not include C for Cinnamon, so we're going to have a problem with our site.

29:53.560 --> 29:57.560
So I take that as the same answer then for say something like MATE, even if say MATE

29:57.560 --> 30:01.320
really takes off on Debian stable at some point.

30:01.320 --> 30:13.960
MATE is to be included very soon in the Debian testing, so our users will update MATE when

30:13.960 --> 30:14.960
they want.

30:14.960 --> 30:15.960
Gotcha.

30:15.960 --> 30:28.840
So Cinnamon was in Debian testing until a few months ago. Then the transition from GTK

30:28.840 --> 30:40.560
3.10 broke Cinnamon, and Cinnamon was removed from Debian testing. At the moment, it's not

30:40.560 --> 30:50.800
available upstream. There's a few how-tos in the forum, how to get Cinnamon from the

30:50.800 --> 31:04.560
Linux Mint Debian repo, but that's it. We have to focus, that's our main focus, on the

31:04.560 --> 31:11.120
two D's that we support and the distributions that we support.

31:11.120 --> 31:17.560
So the tools you ship with SolidX or K, do they have any dependencies on let's say KDE?

31:17.560 --> 31:24.840
So for example, if I decided I'm going to have a solid MATE desktop, would I end up

31:24.840 --> 31:29.080
having to pull down a whole bunch of KDE libs or something like that to use some of the

31:29.080 --> 31:32.480
tools like the software manager?

31:32.480 --> 31:39.080
No, those packages don't have any KDE dependencies.

31:39.080 --> 31:43.320
Now here's the other thing we got some questions about, and I decided during the review not

31:43.320 --> 31:48.160
to really tweak the look too much, but some people thought it was pretty surprising to

31:48.160 --> 31:54.440
see the oxygen theme under XFCE, and is that just personal preference? You guys like the

31:54.440 --> 31:58.760
oxygen theme, or is it consistency? What's the story there?

31:58.760 --> 32:11.160
When we started, we needed to decide on if we wanted to make it look like two totally

32:11.160 --> 32:19.400
different distributions, coincidentally maintained by the same people. We would like to have

32:19.400 --> 32:23.400
some consistency between the two, so we chose for the latter.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.960
Okay, so it's a consistency thing.

32:25.960 --> 32:34.360
Yes, and the oxygen theme was the only one working on both KDE and XFCE without a problem.

32:34.360 --> 32:35.560
The choice was easy.

32:35.560 --> 32:42.800
So now that you're at this stage and you're seeing your community grow, are you guys concerned

32:42.800 --> 32:47.360
about long-term scale? Are you worried about how to hold it all together if more and more

32:47.360 --> 32:52.080
people start using the distribution, and how do you plan to address that?

32:52.080 --> 33:08.960
It's, of course, always a – we're now at a time that we are at a fast growth in our

33:08.960 --> 33:09.960
user base.

33:09.960 --> 33:10.960
Yeah.

33:10.960 --> 33:16.880
Last year from, well, zero to, what would you say now, more than 1,200 users on the

33:16.880 --> 33:31.320
– about, I think, 20 or 30,000 users for our systems. So it's growing very fast. We're

33:31.320 --> 33:42.820
still looking for a suitable business model, like a solid scale more.

33:42.820 --> 33:46.360
You are hoping to make a little bit of a profit at doing this. Do you hope to turn it into

33:46.360 --> 33:47.360
a full-time job?

33:47.360 --> 33:57.000
Yes. Realistically, seeing now that it's not possible, it's so much fun. I would like

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
to do that.

33:58.000 --> 34:03.760
Yeah. It definitely seems to be something that has challenged many companies and people

34:03.760 --> 34:05.800
to turn a profit out of a desktop distribution.

34:05.800 --> 34:12.720
Yes. The business models in open source, especially for Linux distributions, are very difficult.

34:12.720 --> 34:18.880
We're not searching there at the moment. I'm a business consultant by trade.

34:18.880 --> 34:24.240
So do you hope that the business edition might lead to some sort of – like a revenue model

34:24.240 --> 34:25.240
of some kind?

34:25.240 --> 34:31.080
I don't think that the products are going to bring the revenue we need.

34:31.080 --> 34:35.400
So you think it might be like a service-based thing? People will contact you for support?

34:35.400 --> 34:46.680
Services support, maybe some products that we can provide as a service, like cloud solutions

34:46.680 --> 34:52.880
or integration solutions on back-end systems.

34:52.880 --> 34:56.720
So that's sort of a long-term thing then, because the distribution has to see quite

34:56.720 --> 35:00.560
a bit of growth before you probably reach a phase where that would turn it off for profit,

35:00.560 --> 35:02.600
right? So it's a long-term thing here.

35:02.600 --> 35:12.200
Yes. When you – different phases. So you have to think about what do we do on the short

35:12.200 --> 35:18.560
term, so we could think about sponsorship or something like that. But you also have

35:18.560 --> 35:23.520
to think about what is our vision, and is it clear for the community what that vision

35:23.520 --> 35:30.600
is? And how can we shape that?

35:30.600 --> 35:36.160
Do you believe then that – do you believe that the need is strong enough for a rolling

35:36.160 --> 35:41.960
distribution with this quarterly update pack cycle? Do you think that that is solving a

35:41.960 --> 35:47.200
big enough market need that would obviously then be – the thing you could assume from

35:47.200 --> 35:52.480
that is companies like Red Hat and Ubuntu are leaving this need unfulfilled, and so

35:52.480 --> 35:56.720
there's a space for Solid to come up and say, well, look, we're going to offer you

35:56.720 --> 36:01.840
the advantages of rolling with this safety net, and you think that's a big enough of

36:01.840 --> 36:05.400
a market need that you might be able to carve out some business support for that?

36:05.400 --> 36:13.200
Yes, especially for non-profit organizations and governmental institutions.

36:13.200 --> 36:18.920
So when you're pitching somebody – I'll give 00 a chance to jump in. 00, when you're

36:18.920 --> 36:19.920
pitching somebody –

36:19.920 --> 36:24.080
Business, it's with Joel J.

36:24.080 --> 36:29.880
It's his department. It's his department.

36:29.880 --> 36:32.800
I wanted to shift gears and actually change to the rolling release. I would like to get

36:32.800 --> 36:37.680
both of your opinions on why – what do you – what do you convince somebody of a rolling

36:37.680 --> 36:43.640
release? When they say, why do I want rolling, what do you tell them?

36:43.640 --> 37:00.000
Well, first of all, the non-reinstall, again, the non – as you said Sunday, Nuke and Pave,

37:00.000 --> 37:06.680
I think it's the biggest selling point in that pitch.

37:06.680 --> 37:13.200
So you don't have to reload. You finally get it all set up, and you're not forced

37:13.200 --> 37:14.200
to reload.

37:14.200 --> 37:21.420
Yeah, yeah. If we can offer, as we are trying to address with the update packs, if we can

37:21.420 --> 37:34.280
offer an increased safety, I think it's an extra bonus because with the home edition,

37:34.280 --> 37:48.280
we are sitting on top of testing. Testing might not be always stable. So that's why

37:48.280 --> 37:52.800
we opt for this quarterly update packs.

37:52.800 --> 37:56.440
Right. I think it makes sense. It's kind of – it's more – it's rolling with

37:56.440 --> 37:59.000
sort of some safety built in.

37:59.000 --> 38:13.360
With a safety net, exactly. So basically this. And we offered as well, because we are with

38:13.360 --> 38:23.560
testing, we offered as well, an updated user land and the system and base system. Not necessarily

38:23.560 --> 38:36.600
interesting for everybody, but can be interesting for some of our target audience.

38:36.600 --> 38:42.840
Right. Very good. All right. Well, guys, is there anything that we touched on in the review

38:42.840 --> 38:49.280
that you wanted to amend or add during Sunday's Linux action show?

38:49.280 --> 38:54.480
No. I think it was a great review. You both were fantastic.

38:54.480 --> 38:55.480
Oh, thank you.

38:55.480 --> 38:56.480
Oh, jeez.

38:56.480 --> 38:57.480
We enjoyed it.

38:57.480 --> 38:58.480
We enjoyed it.

38:58.480 --> 39:04.920
Yeah. Yeah, it was fun to take a look at it.

39:04.920 --> 39:11.720
We saw that you enjoyed it. It was good.

39:11.720 --> 39:16.840
Very good. Well, Mumble Room, as we wrap up, if you guys have any questions, go ahead and

39:16.840 --> 39:17.840
–

39:17.840 --> 39:24.120
Yeah, shoot. Yeah, shoot. Yeah, exactly. A 00 says shoot, if you have any questions.

39:24.120 --> 39:28.080
I just wanted to say one thing. I've been watching that project ever since it was just

39:28.080 --> 39:33.840
kind of getting bowled around in the – on the Linux forum, Linux Mint forums, and I

39:33.840 --> 39:39.960
got to say it's been interesting to watch it evolve from an idea about a KDE release

39:39.960 --> 39:46.280
to full-blown distro taking on the XFCE from LMDE, which – so that was pretty good. But

39:46.280 --> 39:52.000
I just want to say kudos to both of you for doing such a good job and adding to the community

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
in that way.

39:53.000 --> 39:56.240
Yeah, it's going to be a really interesting distro to watch, and I wish you guys the best

39:56.240 --> 40:00.320
of luck. If you guys want to hang around, we're going to kick around a few topics,

40:00.320 --> 40:04.000
unless anybody else has anything else they want to throw in there. I want to do –

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
I have one more question.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
Oh, go ahead, Rod.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
One more.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
Okay. Yeah, we can do it.

40:08.000 --> 40:12.160
The update packs, they're not for – they're just for the home edition. They're not for

40:12.160 --> 40:13.160
the –

40:13.160 --> 40:14.160
Yes, only for the home editions.

40:14.160 --> 40:15.160
Okay.

40:15.160 --> 40:28.200
I had one question. How about to secure boot UEFI in the installer?

40:28.200 --> 40:39.160
We are testing it right now. Shoji finished the installer UEFI capable last week, two

40:39.160 --> 40:50.800
weeks ago, and we are testing it right now. So our next – the next is those during the

40:50.800 --> 40:59.120
month of April, second half of April should be UEFI capable.

40:59.120 --> 41:01.160
Very good. Wow.

41:01.160 --> 41:10.400
If all the testings go as so far they are, go according to planning.

41:10.400 --> 41:11.400
Right.

41:11.400 --> 41:12.400
I have one more question.

41:12.400 --> 41:13.400
Yeah, sure.

41:13.400 --> 41:17.560
If it's a long-term – like for someone long-term usage, let's say I have someone

41:17.560 --> 41:22.520
who I want to – I'm considering moving to Solid because the whole reinstall thing,

41:22.520 --> 41:27.760
not having to do that, it's very nice. But the issue I have is if they have this one

41:27.760 --> 41:31.760
computer that they would have – they're so far they've been using the same version

41:31.760 --> 41:38.720
distro for two years, maybe three years, and it's kind of got to a point where the updates

41:38.720 --> 41:45.760
on this distro is kind of not working anymore. They're just kind of stalled.

41:45.760 --> 41:52.680
So the Solid solution, if I put them on it and then three years later, would the update

41:52.680 --> 41:59.000
packs with the Home Edition still make it – obviously it's not LTS, but would that

41:59.000 --> 42:05.000
continuously make it – even for that many years?

42:05.000 --> 42:14.680
As long as Debian keeps the testing branch open, we'll keep supplying updates packs.

42:14.680 --> 42:15.680
Sounds good.

42:15.680 --> 42:22.160
I like that. Hopefully, unless something really bad happens, that's going to continue on.

42:22.160 --> 42:29.600
We can't predict the future, but we can hope that Debian keeps the testing branch

42:29.600 --> 42:36.480
open for another two, three years. I think it's safe to say that.

42:36.480 --> 42:39.560
Oh, I was going to ask you guys, what do you think about the whole Debian system D thing?

42:39.560 --> 42:41.600
How does that affect Solid?

42:41.600 --> 42:52.680
We'll follow upstream when they move. So we've been testing, we've been trying system

42:52.680 --> 43:03.680
D. It's not exactly still completely usable in testing, because system D is still a bit

43:03.680 --> 43:13.880
old. You use it, not using. System D is still a bit old, so it's not completely usable.

43:13.880 --> 43:20.280
But when Debian moves to system D, we'll move to system D as well.

43:20.280 --> 43:28.920
Okay, I got another question. Let's say you have a system that you want to have stable

43:28.920 --> 43:32.760
and you want to have the updates kind of thing. So you want a Home Edition and you want the

43:32.760 --> 43:36.800
updates, but you have it where they don't necessarily have an internet most of the time.

43:36.800 --> 43:43.880
Do you have the updates? Are they possible to do like an offline package update?

43:43.880 --> 43:53.120
Not the Solid SK solution, but there are tools in APT for that.

43:53.120 --> 43:54.120
Okay.

43:54.120 --> 44:00.640
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, right. Yeah. Right. You could. Well, guys, great work. Keep it up.

44:00.640 --> 44:03.840
And I hope you can build out a team so that way you don't burn out. That's my big worry.

44:03.840 --> 44:06.840
And I always worry about that with Clem, too.

44:06.840 --> 44:07.840
Thank you.

44:07.840 --> 44:12.040
And it sounds like, you know, you guys said the one thing that sort of resonated with

44:12.040 --> 44:17.880
me that I hope will help you prevent that is focus. You said you know you're focusing.

44:17.880 --> 44:28.080
Yeah. That was one of our first decisions. Focus, do less, but try to do it, well, at

44:28.080 --> 44:30.960
least according to what we think would better.

44:30.960 --> 44:34.600
Good on you. I know Q5SIS wants to take us out with the final question. Go ahead, Q5.

44:34.600 --> 44:42.280
Yeah, I was just wondering what your guys' plan is for when Debian locks down their updates

44:42.280 --> 44:45.560
because they're going in, you know, getting ready to merge into a new branch. Are you

44:45.560 --> 44:48.760
guys still going to be providing updates or are you guys going to freeze just like Debian

44:48.760 --> 44:49.760
does?

44:49.760 --> 45:05.000
No. On the home edition, we follow upstream. So coming next November, Debian will freeze.

45:05.000 --> 45:18.040
So we will, on most of the updates, we will freeze as well. There's a lot of software

45:18.040 --> 45:27.880
that will keep updating, Firefox, Thunderbird, our specific software that it's independent

45:27.880 --> 45:36.640
from Debian. But most of the, all the rest of the software that comes Debian will follow

45:36.640 --> 45:50.480
upstream in there. Unless in the very specific that we find issues during the update packs

45:50.480 --> 46:01.000
and that is, was defined on the, in the beginning, we can pull to solve issues or breakages.

46:01.000 --> 46:13.640
We can pull from, for example, Seed to solve a particular situation. So we have some freedom

46:13.640 --> 46:19.840
in that. We are not, we follow testing, we follow upstream, but we are not absolutely

46:19.840 --> 46:20.840
tied to.

46:20.840 --> 46:21.840
Right. Yeah, I noticed. Go ahead.

46:21.840 --> 46:22.840
Just wanted to say that, is there a service?

46:22.840 --> 46:23.840
No, I was just going to say thank you for clearing that up for me because that was something

46:23.840 --> 46:33.360
I was kind of wondering about and there were a couple in the chat room who were curious

46:33.360 --> 46:34.360
too.

46:34.360 --> 46:39.600
Yeah. All right. Well, I think that, if you guys haven't checked out a review yet, you

46:39.600 --> 46:42.520
should go watch the Linux action show, but I think they got some serious potential there

46:42.520 --> 46:46.080
and maybe, oh, one other question for you guys. Do you guys, are you guys looking for

46:46.080 --> 46:49.600
folks to get involved with the, or are you guys keeping the team lean right now? What's

46:49.600 --> 46:50.600
the plan there?

46:50.600 --> 47:01.400
We can still use a lot of testers and I would like to find somebody who would like to think

47:01.400 --> 47:04.560
about possible business models for SolidXK.

47:04.560 --> 47:09.640
Okay. So where should they go to get a hold of you?

47:09.640 --> 47:17.760
I can do that by going to our site, solidxk.com, as a form, or you can directly mail me at

47:17.760 --> 47:22.640
school year at solidxk.com. There's a lot of possibilities.

47:22.640 --> 47:27.360
Okay. Very good. And we'll have links to their G Plus and Twitter handles and the website

47:27.360 --> 47:30.320
and all that good stuff in the show notes if you guys want to check that out. Before

47:30.320 --> 47:35.280
we run, we don't have time to get into it today because I have to run to a meeting,

47:35.280 --> 47:40.000
but I wanted to pitch a question to the audience. Maybe we can incorporate it into next week's

47:40.000 --> 47:44.600
feedback. This week, Mark Shuttleworth took to his blog and he said the title of it was

47:44.600 --> 47:53.600
ACIP, ACPI, Firmware and Your Security. And he made the case and the one that I resonated

47:53.600 --> 47:56.920
with was he said, if you read the catalog of spy tools and digital weaponry provided

47:56.920 --> 48:01.320
by Edward Snowden, you'll see that the firmware on your device is the NSA's best friend. Your

48:01.320 --> 48:04.560
biggest mistake might be to assume the NSA is the only institution abusing this position

48:04.560 --> 48:08.560
of trust though. In fact, it is reasonable to assume that all firmware is a cesspool

48:08.560 --> 48:14.140
of insecurity, courtesy of the incompetence of the worst degree from manufacturers, incompetence

48:14.140 --> 48:19.200
of the highest degree from a wide range of such agencies. And he goes on to argue that

48:19.200 --> 48:24.640
we need to have a new way of doing firmware. And I'd like to get your guys' take on this.

48:24.640 --> 48:29.560
I've also shared my thoughts in the Linux action show subreddit. I feel like the ship

48:29.560 --> 48:33.280
has already sailed, especially in mobile, but perhaps the opportunity could be opening

48:33.280 --> 48:38.340
up again in ARM in the server room and on future desktops as sort of these big incumbents

48:38.340 --> 48:42.080
sort of have less entrenched interest and move into mobile, maybe they'll lessen their

48:42.080 --> 48:47.960
grip on the desktop. But I'd like to get your guys' feedback. So go over to JupiterBroadcasting.com,

48:47.960 --> 48:52.080
click on the contact link and choose Linux Unplugged from the dropdown. And what do you

48:52.080 --> 48:56.520
think about Mark Shuttleworth's rant against ACPI? I mean, I think nobody here has any

48:56.520 --> 48:58.400
love for ACPI, right, Matt?

48:58.400 --> 49:02.360
You know, I think that he may actually be onto something. I mean, because it's one of

49:02.360 --> 49:05.840
those things no one really ever stops to think about. So I think the fact that he's addressing

49:05.840 --> 49:08.880
it, whether or not it's founded or not, I don't know. I've spent a lot of time. I think

49:08.880 --> 49:09.880
it's important to ask ourselves that question.

49:09.880 --> 49:13.040
Do you think his point's right that we're sort of at a point again where we can re-ask

49:13.040 --> 49:14.960
some of these questions?

49:14.960 --> 49:21.600
I think if we're not there yet, we're approaching it like a freight train. I think we are essentially

49:21.600 --> 49:22.600
there. I think we really are.

49:22.600 --> 49:23.600
Yeah.

49:23.600 --> 49:26.840
All right. Well, very good. So send us your thoughts in on that and we'll incorporate

49:26.840 --> 49:29.880
it in the next week's show as well as send us in your thoughts about anything we covered

49:29.880 --> 49:32.920
on this week's episode of Linux Unplugged. We'd love to get your feedback and don't forget

49:32.920 --> 49:38.760
that subreddit, LinuxActionShow.reddit.com. Matt, I hope you're washing and brushing off

49:38.760 --> 49:42.400
the monkey suit because someday should be a heck of a show.

49:42.400 --> 49:44.400
Got it all vacuum sealed and ready to go.

49:44.400 --> 49:50.400
Okay. Well, I'll make sure to set aside the bananas so that way we have plenty of entertainment

49:50.400 --> 49:53.900
and I'm looking forward to it. So join us on Sunday for Linux Action Show for the monkey

49:53.900 --> 49:58.880
suit spectacular and the retrospective look at Mir. And don't forget you can join Linux

49:58.880 --> 50:03.280
Unplugged live on Tuesdays over at jblive.tv. Just check jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar

50:03.280 --> 50:08.080
for your local time. And we'd love to have you here in our chat room. All right, everyone.

50:08.080 --> 50:12.080
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged. See you right back here

50:12.080 --> 50:38.760
next Tuesday.
