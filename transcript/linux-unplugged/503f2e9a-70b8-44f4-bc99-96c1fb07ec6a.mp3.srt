1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,860
I don't usually go around from the rooftop shouting, have you heard of GIMP?

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,380
Have you heard of GIMP?

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:10,720
But this guy, four days ago, a story goes up about this guy who sucked so bad at Photoshop,

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:16,140
he spent 10 years mastering Microsoft Paint to illustrate his book.

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,440
And you know, I got to say he did a pretty good job, Wes.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,300
It looks like basically the quality of The Simpsons.

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,000
So he got a lot out of Microsoft Paint.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I mean, I'll give him that.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
When was the last time you did something like that in Paint?

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,880
I would tell you it would be never.

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,480
I didn't even know you could do something like this in Paint.

12
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,520
I mean, you'd have to use wine, but still.

13
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:40,720
He says, I honed my craft working long overnights at a hospital reception desk.

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,680
I'm not sure how I feel about that.

15
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,340
Then I decided to write and self-publish an e-book about summer camp in the 1980s.

16
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,340
So it's pretty cool.

17
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,340
It's all illustrated in Paint.

18
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,340
Look at that.

19
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,340
Yeah.

20
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,480
But you got to stop and go, in 10 years, you never heard of GIMP?

21
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:02,920
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's been running the benchmarks

22
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,160
all day long.

23
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,160
My name is Chris.

24
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,160
My name is Wes.

25
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,160
Hello, Wes.

26
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,240
We have a great show today.

27
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,800
You're already fired up and ready to go, too.

28
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,800
You've been rehearsing.

29
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,200
You've been practicing on that TechSnap program, so I know it's going to be good.

30
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,200
Oh, yeah.

31
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,280
As we go on the air, while I was at lunch, we have some really interesting news out of

32
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,880
Canonical about what they might be doing with Ubuntu.

33
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,880
We'll see.

34
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,880
Ubuntu has two posts.

35
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,840
We'll talk a little bit about the dues, and then we'll talk a little bit about the survey,

36
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,280
which may give us more hints, too.

37
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,280
I'm curious already.

38
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,280
Yeah.

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,920
I do have a little bit of a crisis of faith this week.

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,680
Been looking at some of the news coming out of Microsoft's build.

41
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,120
Yes, I said Microsoft's build conference.

42
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,120
What?

43
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:49,080
And they're bringing Bash to Windows Server.

44
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,080
Server set.

45
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,080
Yeah.

46
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,080
Just getting serious.

47
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,080
I know.

48
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,080
They're going to have SSH on Windows Server in legit ways.

49
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,240
So we're going to be talking about that, what that could mean for Linux.

50
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,360
We're going to help you with your shell stuff.

51
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,360
Got some shell problems?

52
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,600
Well, now that it's on Windows, I mean, now it's serious business.

53
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,360
That is literally why I was like, well, now people are going to have a bunch of noobs

54
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,360
trying it out.

55
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,360
It was literally my thoughts.

56
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,880
Some community stuff to get into, and then one of our favorite open source projects on

57
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,880
the show.

58
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,440
We're just going to give you a little recap on what's been going on.

59
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,680
And speaking of open source projects, our own community has been working on an amazing

60
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,680
soundboard project.

61
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,200
I can't wait to show you some of the things they've done.

62
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,380
They've built something that's truly, truly feature rich and competitive.

63
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:32,940
And then later on, towards the end of the show, but not quite, you know, it's not really

64
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,940
the end.

65
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,940
No, of course not.

66
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,160
In some sense, it's a whole new beginning.

67
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,360
We're going to talk about the Galago Pro.

68
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,360
What?

69
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,360
Yeah.

70
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,160
We're going to do a little review of System76's brand new Galago Pro, which is in Wes's hot

71
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,360
little hands right now.

72
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,360
Performing very nicely.

73
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,480
But that's just a tease.

74
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,480
That's me tapping it.

75
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,480
Yeah, that's real metal.

76
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,040
Have you fingered that logo?

77
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,280
Turn your hands over that logo right there.

78
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,280
You feel how good that is?

79
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,280
Yeah, man.

80
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,280
It's baked in.

81
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,280
It's baked in.

82
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,280
It's baked in.

83
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,560
So we'll be talking about that coming up in a little bit today.

84
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,560
A bunch of stuff.

85
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,000
Bunch of bunch of stuff.

86
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's good to be here.

87
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm glad.

88
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,640
I feel like, Wes, I feel like I've just recently given delivery to a new baby.

89
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,640
Right.

90
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,640
That's a big moment for you.

91
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,640
I've been doing a lot of things.

92
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,640
So what have you been doing?

93
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,640
You been up to anything interesting?

94
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,640
All kinds of stuff.

95
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,640
Yeah.

96
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,640
Yeah.

97
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,960
But I don't know if it can compare with what you have just birthed to the world.

98
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
I don't want to take.

99
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,960
I don't want to take this.

100
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,480
I don't want to take away the spotlight, Wes, but pretty excited about Linux Action News

101
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,780
episode one.

102
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,780
Pretty excited.

103
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,780
You should be.

104
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,040
Linuxactionnews.com if you want to check it out.

105
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,200
Joe Ressington and me.

106
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,160
What's the elevator pitch here?

107
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,680
Think of it as this.

108
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,300
It's Joe and I who've been doing podcasting for a long time.

109
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,320
It's our take on the weekly happenings in Linux and open source.

110
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:47,240
And I started this show with Joe because I thought things are really changing in Linux.

111
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,800
There's a new reality that's in some ways extremely great for Linux and there's a few

112
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,700
other headwinds that are really concerning and so much stuff is developing.

113
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,520
It's really a great time to have a good discussion show.

114
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:03,480
And Joe has not only just a great take on the open source world and he's been following

115
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:09,120
it for a long time, but from his experience with Linux Luddites and now Late Night Linux,

116
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,880
all both of which are great shows, he's really developed a routine and a system down to collect

117
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,320
news and analyze news and really think about it really well.

118
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,920
So I knew like just from the podcasters I listened to, he'd be one of the best guys

119
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,920
to do the show.

120
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,040
I was like, well maybe Joe would want to do it.

121
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,640
And then it turned out, yeah, Joe did want to do it with me.

122
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,640
I was like, awesome.

123
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,640
That was like my first choice.

124
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,640
Totally.

125
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,880
And the thing was is when we announced the end of the Linux action show, the biggest

126
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,760
feedback we got is people really liked the news.

127
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,520
And they tuned in to find out what was going on each week with Linux and open source.

128
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,280
You were their evening news program.

129
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,120
And for some people it's like, well this is my living, this is kind of how I make my living

130
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:55,280
and it's helpful to just have another resource to stay up to date on stuff, to keep current.

131
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,840
And so it was kind of with sort of the lessons learned from Linux action show and that kind

132
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,840
of market in mind that we launched this show.

133
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,840
It's still early days.

134
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,520
The first few episodes are always kind of early days, kind of like rough.

135
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,840
It's not like it's rough because he and I have been doing it for so long that it's not

136
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,840
amateurs.

137
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,600
But at the same time it's like not what the final product is going to be.

138
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,600
You're still finding the right energy, how you want it to go.

139
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,160
And then of course there's all the cool stuff that we've been working on, like back end

140
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,560
technology to make it all possible and new hosting and all this kind of stuff.

141
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,160
It was a lot of work to get there and we're super excited because episode one is out.

142
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,160
I think it's been received pretty well.

143
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,160
I think so.

144
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,760
So I'd love to have you guys at least try it out and maybe consider it.

145
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,880
It's a little bit tighter of a show.

146
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,880
It's usually going to be about 30 minutes or so, so that means you've really got some

147
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,200
time to fit it into maybe an already busy podcast schedule or a commute.

148
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,880
It should be never like one of those shows that's going to monopolize your entire podcast

149
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,880
player for the week.

150
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,120
So what's the schedule going to be?

151
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
Mondays.

152
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,680
So hopefully it'll be out every Monday.

153
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,480
It's going to be a good day for the network.

154
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,560
News show out on Monday, four-year morning download.

155
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,320
You can listen to it whenever you want in the week, but if you want to start your Monday

156
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,320
with it or if you – so I figure we'll put it out there and whenever people want to listen

157
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,320
to it they'll listen.

158
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,320
I think that's great.

159
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,320
Yeah.

160
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,320
I'm excited.

161
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,200
If you want to just go to episode one it's linuxactionnews.com slash one.

162
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,200
Pretty simple.

163
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,200
Easy peasy.

164
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,200
I don't know if the WW is working or not.

165
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,560
We'll find out later.

166
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,560
I blame Dan Benjamin.

167
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,560
I blame Dan Benjamin.

168
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,560
All right.

169
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,320
Well, so let's talk about actual news.

170
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:29,240
This was posted over at OMG Ubuntu just one hour ago, as literally one hour ago as we're

171
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,820
recording right now.

172
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:35,840
The Ubuntu desktop team has discussed some of their plans for Gnome on Ubuntu 17.10 and

173
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,840
things have sort of settled since Mark's initial announcement and people are processing

174
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,600
it going through the stages of grief with some of the Unity users.

175
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,520
It seems like they kind of picked up that people like needed a little bit more info

176
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,800
to really understand what this might look like.

177
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,480
XFCE users started walking around saying, I told you so over and over again.

178
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,400
You know, everybody's got their time.

179
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,040
And so we've been all curious to really kind of find out what would Canonical really do.

180
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,240
I mean, are they really just going to ship stock Ubuntu?

181
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:07,640
And so Kevin Van Dyne, I think, Van Dyne, I just Kevin V from Canonical, he's worked

182
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,640
there for eight years.

183
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,640
So I'm sorry, Kevin.

184
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,640
You're never going to learn it at this point.

185
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,760
Yeah, well, yeah, because he and I talk so often.

186
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,960
He spent the past three years working on various parts of the Unity 8 stack and he's now part

187
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,720
of the Ubuntu desktop team.

188
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,060
Now I think we should just start right there.

189
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,480
There was a Unity 8 team.

190
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,820
There's not a Unity 8 team.

191
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:29,240
But if you notice the way Joey wrote this, he's now moved to the Ubuntu desktop team,

192
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,320
which tells us there is, in fact, an Ubuntu desktop.

193
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,640
So that's an interesting little bit.

194
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,080
And he's tasked with the successful switch over to Gnome.

195
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:44,600
And they kind of I think we might be seeing a more customized Gnome from Ubuntu than we

196
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,320
were originally sort of led to believe because we had some worries that it was just going

197
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,320
to be like this.

198
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,960
They're just going to ship stock and that's not going to be great.

199
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,960
Mark said something to that effect.

200
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,600
It's like they're going to ship Gnome as Gnome intended to be.

201
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,800
But nobody's a huge fan of that, really.

202
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:03,480
And so Joey over at OMG Ubuntu asked Kevin if they plan to customize Ubuntu Gnome 17.10.

203
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,680
And it looks like they're kind of making some considerations.

204
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,360
Few tweaks here and there he says.

205
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,120
We want to give our users a good experience.

206
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,840
And so they're launching a poll with the help of OMG Ubuntu to try to figure out what some

207
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,560
of those tweaks should be.

208
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,040
And so OMG Ubuntu has launched a short survey that Canonical is apparently listening to

209
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,360
and they're going to take in some of the feedback too.

210
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,960
So it seems like a good opportunity to tell them what you'd like to see in the Gnome desktop.

211
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,360
Kind of a unique opportunity, I mean really kind of an incredible opportunity if you think

212
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,360
about it.

213
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,360
This is one of those ones where later you're going to complain and we're going to be like,

214
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,360
well, did you vote?

215
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,560
Did you go to that survey?

216
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,240
This was posted 40 minutes ago, by the way.

217
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,200
So yeah, so this is all still happening pretty fast right now.

218
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,320
So here's just a little idea.

219
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:52,400
Here's some of the extensions that people are being asked to rate, Dash to Dock, Impatience,

220
00:08:52,400 --> 00:09:00,520
No Top, Left Hot Corner, Alternate Tab, Applications Menu, Better Volume Indicator, Top Icons Plus.

221
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,520
Is that your fan?

222
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,520
Is your fan kicking up?

223
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,520
I think so, yeah.

224
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,080
Yeah, it does that sometimes.

225
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,080
So there you go.

226
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,000
That's what they're looking at.

227
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,200
I kind of want to take the survey.

228
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,400
Yeah, you should.

229
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,400
Should I do it?

230
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,400
Do it.

231
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,400
Dash to Dock, what do you think?

232
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,400
Not useful or very useful?

233
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,400
Mumble room.

234
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,400
Oh wait, let's bring the mumble room in.

235
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,400
Yeah, what are we doing?

236
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,400
Let's make it official.

237
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,400
They can help us take it too.

238
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,800
We'll bring them in right now.

239
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,920
Time appropriate greetings there, mumble room.

240
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,520
Hello everybody.

241
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,520
So what do you say?

242
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,000
Should we take the survey together?

243
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Sure.

244
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Absolutely.

245
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,640
Ready for it?

246
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,560
Okay, Dash to Dock, useful or not useful?

247
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,440
What say you, mumble room?

248
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,920
Useful or not useful?

249
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,920
Five.

250
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,920
Useful.

251
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,920
Yeah.

252
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,920
Very useful.

253
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,920
Definitely useful.

254
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,520
I figure I could probably figure out the number rating based on how many people say useful

255
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,520
or not useful.

256
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,320
Like if a lot of people say useful, then it's more of a five, and if less people say, then

257
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,320
I'll say it's...

258
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,320
Okay.

259
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,480
So impatience.

260
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,440
Impatience speeds up the GNOME desktop animations for minimizing and maximizing windows and

261
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,440
triggering overlays and things like that.

262
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,560
Would you say this is a useful extension or not useful extension?

263
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,560
Never useful.

264
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,560
Useful.

265
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,560
Yeah.

266
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,560
Okay.

267
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,560
All right.

268
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,560
I'm going to give that one more of a three.

269
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,560
Yeah, middle of the road there.

270
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,560
Yeah.

271
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,560
No top left hot corner.

272
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,920
This disables the top left hot corner in GNOME, which triggers your desktop and makes

273
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,160
everything move around like I just did on my video screen here.

274
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,160
What do you say?

275
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,160
No top left hot corner.

276
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,440
Is that a very useful thing or not useful?

277
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,440
I don't care.

278
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,440
Useful.

279
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,440
I think it's pretty useful.

280
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,440
Sounds like it.

281
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,440
I'm going to influence it.

282
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,440
I think I like the...

283
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,440
I'm going to give it a four.

284
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,880
See, I've never thought about it before, but just during this last TechSnap program, I

285
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,400
was like, boy, it'd be nice if this didn't happen all the time.

286
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,360
Yeah, it does get you when you're broadcasting.

287
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,360
Yeah.

288
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,360
Alternate tab.

289
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,840
I'm just going to give that a middle of the road because I want to move on.

290
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,040
I don't want to take all day on the survey.

291
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,960
Turns out there's like Linux news or something.

292
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
Okay.

293
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,960
Here's the thing, though.

294
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,680
This is the one that I am very torn up about, and this is the one I've actually wanted to

295
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,880
get everybody's opinion on the strongest.

296
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,440
The applications menu, which introduces a category-based app menu for searching and

297
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:07,800
opening applications, which replaces the full screen applications menu in default GNOME.

298
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,060
Useful or not useful?

299
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,640
Useful for new users.

300
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,640
Fair.

301
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,640
Okay.

302
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,760
I feel like it's also a bit of an atrocity, though.

303
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,280
I mean, it's a huge diversion from the way the default environment-

304
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,440
I've actually never tried it.

305
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,440
I have.

306
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,440
It's okay.

307
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,440
It's okay.

308
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,440
It's no brisk.

309
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,440
It's fine.

310
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,440
It's fine.

311
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,600
I guess I hadn't really thought about the new user angle.

312
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,400
It can be nice to have sorted categories to find things.

313
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,400
Yep.

314
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,400
Yep.

315
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
That's one of the reasons I deal with mate.

316
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,880
Do you think we should be catering to new users?

317
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,240
That's a very legitimate question.

318
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,240
Oh, boy.

319
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,200
See, here's the thing is I was going to make that an entire discussion in today's show

320
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:57,000
because I think that is the question of Linux going forward is I think we should really

321
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,120
refrain from even considering the new user because we are fooling ourselves at this point.

322
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,240
I don't mean to be a Debbie Downer about this.

323
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,720
I wasn't necessarily going to get into this because I'm still trying to put my thoughts

324
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,040
together on this.

325
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,200
But you look at this news from Canonical.

326
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,480
Okay, so here's the thing, Wes.

327
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:23,720
If Canonical couldn't do it, I mean there's been no greater success in desktop Linux history

328
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,360
than the Ubuntu desktop.

329
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,060
There has been no desktop that has been prepackaged, no Linux desktop that has been prepackaged

330
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:32,520
with hardware manufacturers more than the Ubuntu desktop.

331
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:39,800
There has never been a greater success story in desktop Linux than Ubuntu, Unity 7 even.

332
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:48,680
And if they can't pull it off, I would argue that it's not a measurement of the technological

333
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,000
prowess of the mere display server.

334
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,680
I would argue that it is not the buttons on the left-hand side of the Unity 7 windows

335
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,640
that prevented these things from happening.

336
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:07,400
I would argue that there is just simply no real market pressure in the West that is driving

337
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:14,160
consumers to seek out a solution that is not Windows, Mac, or Chrome OS or tablets.

338
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:21,020
In countries like China and India and other places, of course, there are different market

339
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,160
factors at play.

340
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,160
And those consumers have been driven to seek out different solutions.

341
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,000
And so there it is successful.

342
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,040
But in order to be successful in the West, it just seems it's an impossibility.

343
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,400
It is amongst the average consumer.

344
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:44,880
Now certain niches like engineering, software development, certain levels of high-end media

345
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:51,400
production, it seems likely that Linux will continue to just win there amongst people

346
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,240
who are seeking out a market alternative.

347
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,280
For whatever reason, the one they're using isn't fulfilling their need.

348
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:03,080
But that is just simply, simply, simply not the case for your most average consumer, the

349
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,920
quote, unquote, new user coming to Linux.

350
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,340
I don't believe they exist.

351
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:11,600
So maybe are there multiple tiers here of new user and what we should give up on or

352
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,800
not focus on anyway is this very casual user we have to cater to?

353
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,460
Because maybe we do still want it to be easy for the engineer coming from Windows to get

354
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,360
here who's willing to learn a little.

355
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,140
You still want to be able to, as a Linux enthusiast and geek, you still want to be able to solve

356
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:31,800
somebody's problem by taking some crappy Windows install off their laptop and putting Linux

357
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,800
on there for them.

358
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,320
You want them to be able to use it.

359
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,140
So there's obviously this quote, unquote, new user that we're always sort of theoretically

360
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:44,000
trying to make sure that software is easy to install so that they're happy and that

361
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,040
themes look right so that it's pleasant to them and that we have things like application

362
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,400
menus that completely overwrite the way that the desktop environment has been designed

363
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,720
to work.

364
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,720
It's not like GNOME accidentally doesn't have an applications menu.

365
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,320
That's some serious intentional design.

366
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,720
Well, and for me, it's like, also, I don't want us to think about this new user, super

367
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,200
new user, whatever, at the expense of power users.

368
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,480
Because for me, one thing I love about GNOME is I hit that key and I type the thing that

369
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,840
I want that I know that I want and I get it immediately.

370
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,560
And there are some systems where that's not the case, and especially if I have to go browse

371
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,480
through this menu to this thing that I already want.

372
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,680
It's not a workflow that I'm going to use and it drives me away from it.

373
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,680
Yeah.

374
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,620
Wimpy, what are your thoughts?

375
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,880
You raise a lot of good points there.

376
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:33,020
The first, so going all the way back to the applications menu in GNOME, I don't think

377
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:39,480
that that should be included because it's a real departure from how GNOME is designed

378
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,480
to work.

379
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,480
Totally.

380
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:47,440
And to follow on from that, you're kind of right about the new user thing.

381
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:53,920
I would say anecdotally, I do see a lot of new users coming to Linux for the first time

382
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,640
through Ubuntu MATE.

383
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:01,720
So through that community, I see new people joining all the time.

384
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,840
Is that, do you feel unique or do you think that, is it unique because Ubuntu MATE is

385
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:11,560
super appealing to Raspberry Pis and reclaiming old hardware or do you think maybe I just

386
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,440
am missing the boat on that particular point?

387
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,440
Okay.

388
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,000
So I'm excluding Raspberry Pis from that.

389
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
These are people that have had Windows on a computer and are now running Ubuntu MATE

390
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
on a computer.

391
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,840
And I don't know what the numbers are like.

392
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:29,200
I'm not saying it's millions or anything, but certainly they're out there.

393
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,840
They're out there enough that I've seen enough posts in the forums to register that there

394
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,820
are this group of people that are new to Linux.

395
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:40,600
And if you speak to the elementary guys, I think that they would tell you the same as

396
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,600
well.

397
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,800
So they are out there.

398
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,880
But what I would also say is that I think you're right, that Ubuntu has had good success

399
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,120
in appealing to a professional market.

400
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:59,400
And I think the default Ubuntu desktop should be geared towards professionals and specifically

401
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:07,400
developers and the flavors I think can attract the consumer market.

402
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,060
Wow, that's a powerful statement.

403
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:17,720
So I suppose I have some personal experience recently if we're going with anecdotal experience

404
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:23,960
of her Mother's Day, family member that I didn't even know was using Ubuntu, turned

405
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:28,240
out to be using Ubuntu, because some computer guy that helped her fix her computer told

406
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,240
her to install it.

407
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,240
Really?

408
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,240
And she didn't even know it was Ubuntu.

409
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:36,400
If I didn't see that Unity sidebar in that classic background, you should have seen the

410
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,400
double tag.

411
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,400
What?

412
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,400
What?

413
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,400
What?

414
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,400
What?

415
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,400
What?

416
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,400
What?

417
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,400
What?

418
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,400
What?

419
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,400
What?

420
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,400
What?

421
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,400
So I think she had no agenda.

422
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,400
She doesn't really care.

423
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,900
She just wants to be all ease the internet.

424
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,900
Right.

425
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,440
So Wimpy you could be right, and to a certain degree, maybe I'm being a little more extra

426
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,440
pessimistic.

427
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,800
I think it's probably what you're saying, is I'm being a little pessimistic, but I definitely

428
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:04,560
feel like we're spinning our wheels and wasting our time constantly theorizing about a theoretical

429
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,180
user when it's not really an applicable…

430
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:12,920
Okay, so I guess I want to shift gears because there is a new user that is out there, that

431
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:17,040
it seems to be a real number and that would be say India and China, where people are walking

432
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,240
into stores and buying Ubuntu machines and there's totally different market dynamics

433
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,240
there.

434
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,240
What about them?

435
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,240
Don't they deserve a custom built desktop?

436
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,400
Or are they shipping something like Ubuntu Chillin and maybe it's just a totally different

437
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,400
experience.

438
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,400
Right.

439
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:37,400
Well in China that's exactly what they're getting but in general I mean is Ubuntu currently

440
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,760
geared towards one audience or the other?

441
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:45,080
Is it particularly new user friendly or is it developer friendly or is it pro user friendly

442
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,120
or is it just general purpose?

443
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,240
And I don't think that's going to change in Ubuntu right.

444
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,480
I think that whichever way these desktop extensions go and the way GNOME is implemented it's going

445
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,720
to be just as applicable to new users and pro users.

446
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,560
I think what's important is that these extensions just make things intuitive.

447
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,320
So here's how I kind of fell down on it.

448
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,520
I said applications menu I'm going to say not useful much I'm not going to say one but

449
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:20,920
hear me out, hear me out, hear me out because I also rated better volume indicator as not

450
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:26,680
very useful and then I put top icons as four which is pretty useful and window controls

451
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,680
on the right.

452
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,680
Now hear me out.

453
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,520
Here's why I started bailing a little bit on some of these extensions.

454
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:38,640
I get nervous about the idea of stock Ubuntu shipping all hacked up with extensions.

455
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,360
There's like a hard limit on the number that we should really be comfortable with is what

456
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,360
you're saying here.

457
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,680
So I'm starting to look at these and I'm starting to go not totally necessary to make

458
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,860
GNOME usable.

459
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:51,600
Especially if Ubuntu is not doing anything anymore right like they're not guaranteeing

460
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,120
the stability of these things or that they'll always be consistent necessarily.

461
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,440
So that depends too right.

462
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,360
Especially if we are still concerned about new users if we do have these extensions breaking

463
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,680
your whole experience that that's not great.

464
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:08,160
These extensions are going to have to be packaged in order to be part of the image so that means

465
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,040
that they're going to be maintained and therefore they will work release to release.

466
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,640
It's not like I suppose if you're on LTS it's not like you're going to go from a major version

467
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,640
of GNOME.

468
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,640
Yeah.

469
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,640
Yeah.

470
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,880
So but I still I still think probably some discretion would be would be advised on how

471
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,880
many extensions.

472
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,400
So anyways if you want to go vote yourself you can go to OMG Ubuntu Joey just put those

473
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,340
up and it sounds like this is a you know an interesting conversation that I would bet

474
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:36,480
is probably like likely happening at all different levels at Canonical too.

475
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:42,600
So we still haven't gotten a lot of details on Fedora or SUSE on the Windows Linux subsystem

476
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,360
thing which is kind of strange or whatever the hell everyone's already running arch on

477
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,520
that thing anyway.

478
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,520
Good one.

479
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,080
And maybe it doesn't matter because pretty soon you're going to be running bash on your

480
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,240
Windows servers Windows servers Windows servers running bash.

481
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,840
See there was a time when I would have I actually did climb very tall mountains to get SSH working

482
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,840
on Windows.

483
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,640
Well how else were you going to administer them back in the day.

484
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,800
I guess now there's like WinRM and more options.

485
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,800
Yeah.

486
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:16,800
And and I also had to bend over backwards to get event logs into Syslog and all of these

487
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:22,880
tools were either made possible by Cygwin or something that like bundled up Cygwin on

488
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,720
its own in its own little Cygwin environment.

489
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,920
It was always it was always the hacky at best.

490
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,920
Yeah.

491
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,640
And just felt so ancient.

492
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,280
So now I can only imagine if I if I was stuck around administering Windows servers and if

493
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:42,620
I could get a legitimate Ubuntu LTS bash shell or Fedora shell or Sousa that would be a game

494
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:46,960
changer for me because my bash grips now I could take so many of my I mean in theory

495
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,040
I would have access to cron which is way better than the Windows scheduler like all of these

496
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,120
things would shift for me I would have access to so many tools I could have I could have

497
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:00,080
good old traditional nmap right there on a Windows server which would be very useful.

498
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,680
For me I wonder how much I wonder how well like what's the interaction like between those

499
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:10,080
two because if I can start using like the Linux or the new tools that I know and love

500
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,240
to start maybe applying some automation to the Windows side not that I want to do that

501
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,440
but I could certainly see people wanting to do that there's also the scary thought of

502
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,120
like well now people can start doing like Windows server you know you have like Docker

503
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,160
containers for Windows that spin up different like more little Windows server containers

504
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:31,700
that each have different bash Linux distributions inside so your next VBS might be running on

505
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:38,440
Windows server Chris. Jeez wow. Yeah Docker is also by the way so I have linked in the

506
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:44,020
show notes the Microsoft server for developers blog also Windows server is joining the Windows

507
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:47,680
insider program so if you want to run beta versions of stuff on your Windows server that's

508
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:53,040
kind of cool actually I guess they but back to the containerization thing they said the

509
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:59,360
nano server that they came up with is picking up in popularity and they're gonna they're

510
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,960
gonna focus on providing the very best container foundation for developers with a nano server

511
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:11,800
that's okay it's so small yeah and they're gonna and they're also expanding their Docker

512
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:17,840
support which will use Hyper-V isolation technology and you can use your choice of Linux kernel

513
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,160
to host the workload while the management scripts and tool could use the Windows subsystem

514
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:30,740
for Linux. Oh wow. So you can run you can pick and match your your container it is isolated

515
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:35,820
using Hyper-V and you can pick and match the Linux kernel that that container runs on top

516
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:44,320
of and then you can manage it all with bash on a Windows server. Wow what kind of world

517
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,200
do we live in now I don't even know how I don't know how to feel about this. I think

518
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,240
we live in one where Microsoft figured out how to seriously successfully compete with

519
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:59,160
Linux yeah in a way that is going to fundamentally potentially shift the market maybe I mean

520
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:03,240
it's not like you've been able to run VM Linux VMs on Windows boxes for years yeah right

521
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:09,560
so I don't know it does see it in some ways I don't know what the server side is gonna

522
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,560
do I don't know how that will change things that I'm not I haven't really thought about

523
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,360
that seems more to me for some reason it seems like a bigger deal than the desktop that's

524
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,600
what I was gonna say for the desktop side it feels like well like half of everyone's

525
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,360
already stuck on Windows at work anyway it seems like to me it was this is more of a

526
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,960
threat to Mac OS desktops than it is to because like who's running the Linux desktop there

527
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,160
anyway either you are and you're not gonna change to go to Windows just because of this

528
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,760
or you're already stuck on Windows but if you have a Mac suddenly like Windows looks

529
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:39,040
kind of better than a Mac in some ways for running closer to a real Linux you know especially

530
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,620
if you want a variety of hardware choices or you need to work with a vendor that your

531
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:47,600
company already orders from. MonkeyGum do you want to walk me off the ledge a bit? Yeah

532
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,440
the nano thing isn't all that's replacing is everyone that's running VM workstation

533
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:58,360
with a Linux image running inside of it that's all it's doing because it's a piece of hardware

534
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:03,640
and yeah it's just replacing the VM workstation that's all it's doing. No it's not a bad

535
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:09,000
market for them to get into yeah I don't really follow it very closely I don't really have

536
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,600
much interest in. You're not in the insiders program? No I don't and I don't have any interest

537
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:18,960
in Windows Nano server but I do I just. They really are doing a lot of work to try to be

538
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,980
competitive. This is making me have a serious crisis of faith right now like excuse me today

539
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:30,480
there was a rumor that got posted that there's gonna be refreshed MacBooks at WWDC and even

540
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,660
if they're not at WWDC you know they're gonna be out in the fall there's also gonna be a

541
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:39,560
new iMac workstation I would I would expect it probably to be Xeon with ECC memory. Yeah

542
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:44,640
right there's been talk of a new pro at some point. Yep yep so it's not like the Mac OS

543
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,720
platform is gonna sit still forever within six months they're pretty much gonna have

544
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:55,400
their shit together. Now on Windows you've got Bash on you've got SUSE Fedora and Ubuntu

545
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:01,300
on Windows 10. In the store. So you can you can basically have your dev environment match

546
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:05,880
production on your Windows 10 machine that also lets you play your Steam games and has

547
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:12,200
all the other crap that I guess Windows users like and then and then we get left with on

548
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:19,440
in Linux we have really I mean Gnome is it's not like it's some huge project like there's

549
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,360
a lot riding on something that is not like it's that huge and it was just a couple of

550
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:34,640
years ago teetering on bankruptcy. Is this a good time to bring up plasma? Yes. I mean

551
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:40,120
yeah I know I'm just saying like more than ever our our independent desktop projects

552
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:44,840
are going to be more important than ever. And it does feel like just I just wouldn't

553
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:49,240
I wouldn't have attributed all of this momentum or whatever the feeling was I before this

554
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:53,440
I wouldn't have attributed to Ubuntu necessarily maybe unfairly but now it does kind of feel

555
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,720
like the wind has been sucked from the room or the air you know I mean like it's there's

556
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,680
like a pause here and it's like our big competitive advantage is starting to be taken away. Now

557
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,880
it doesn't and the thing is is it doesn't it doesn't erode our competitive advantage

558
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:14,200
in hardware or it doesn't erode the advantages that the GPL brings but it it does erode the

559
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,600
one thing that personally I've been invested in a long time which is the desktop. Yeah

560
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:23,120
I mean that's a lot of what we talk about here on this program even you know it's. And

561
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,600
I mean I and it's just there with Canonical making these changes it just puts this huge

562
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,420
elephant in the room that I feel like I'm ignoring if I don't talk about. Something

563
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:33,640
you said on a research maybe it was the one of the last I'm not sure but you talk about

564
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,920
how you're like wouldn't really call yourself an evangelist anymore and that's kind of what

565
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,880
strikes me too is it's like no one's saying that Linux isn't a useful tool and it's obviously

566
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:46,200
still very useful people still want to deploy it on servers look at Azure but yeah there's

567
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:51,360
less of this like gung-ho we can replace things on the desktop this is the whole stack you

568
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,960
can use now it feels a little bit more like well yeah I mean use it if you use it if you

569
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:03,100
want to we'll help maybe yeah I'll know a show basically I can I what my what my take

570
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:07,800
was is I don't consider my I'm not an evangelist anymore I don't go I don't go out and actively

571
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:14,160
evangelize the platform I do want to see it continue I do like so I I am in some sense

572
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,640
I'm an advocate because I try to I try to promote projects like on these shows and stuff

573
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:23,600
like that to help them and I contribute financially to projects and I try to be an advocate but

574
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,240
I don't really evangelize as much anymore because it's really getting to the point for

575
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,160
me it's like I don't have a super solid argument I can tell you that it's my preferred working

576
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:35,120
environment I can tell you that I work the best under it and I find it to be the less

577
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:41,040
for the least frustrating of the desktop operating systems and I like specifically with a with

578
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:47,840
a rolling distribution I really like the the fact that for a really long time I was reloading

579
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:52,680
my machines at least once a year every six months whatever and so since I switched to

580
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:58,160
Arch on some of my work machines it's it's the installation just lives as long as that

581
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:04,280
hardware lives yeah and that's really nice because it just means that everything set

582
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,720
up my SSH keys my GPG stuff you don't have to change it you don't have to worry about

583
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,900
it I just sit down and I can work and and and that's nice because it's been like that

584
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:17,200
now for like three years and it's like wow this is really valuable and I can't really

585
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,600
explain to a Windows user because you're always gonna get the Windows user says well I haven't

586
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,760
had any problems on my install for four years great good for you congratulations didn't

587
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:29,360
work like that for me and it's about me and so for me these these systems I find them

588
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,880
they stay the performance stays consistent if they generally get just better the desktop

589
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,840
are being stopped environments are just getting better with updates my applications are just

590
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,840
getting better and more competitive especially with you know a lot of the a lot of the latest

591
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:47,080
us all just on electron anyways I guess what it makes me think is like we're back to philosophy

592
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,560
instead of like before there was some camps right like you can't reproduce production

593
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,560
on your desktop if you don't run a Linux system you know and and there's like various ones

594
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,800
of those were like you just you need a Linux if you want to do this it seems like less

595
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,400
and less of that it's like you can still use Linux for that if you want to use Linux it'll

596
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,520
work great we encourage you to do so but it's now more of like should or you'll feel better

597
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:11,280
doing it or here's some like philosophical open source type reasons why you might want

598
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:15,800
to and for some people those just aren't as compelling monkey calm you think the tools

599
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:22,920
matter yeah I mean over the last five years the tools available to Linux users have just

600
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:29,080
quadrupled I mean we're running jet brain with Ruby mine and just the mysql tools that

601
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:35,520
are just they run and they work better and faster and more stable and Linux than Windows

602
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,980
and I have developers are run jet brain and mysql tools and Windows and I have developers

603
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:44,920
are running Linux and the Linux guys are converting the Windows users to Linux and none of them

604
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:51,160
run unity they all run either Gnome Mette or KDE yeah and I think canonical sees it

605
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:57,560
too I mean I think they understand that that that is it excuse me that is exactly the type

606
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,240
of user that is actively looking to switch to Linux right I'm not saying people aren't

607
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,320
switching to Linux I'm trying to build it I'm essentially what I'm building the case

608
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,880
for here is we really just need to forget about the general market and just really kind

609
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,520
of realize realize who's switching it's gonna be people we switch ourselves to Linux or

610
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,560
people like monkey calm that they just outlined or look at canonical right before canonical

611
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:22,400
made this huge shift what did they do they went on Hacker News start of the thread hey

612
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,720
guys what do you want to see what's Hacker News tell me we want to see Gnome we want

613
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,420
to see Wayland we just want to see basically printing a little better we want to see this

614
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:34,600
a little better and just ship it all stock so that way think about this and then we'll

615
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:40,640
move on if I was switching from Mac OS or Windows one of the things I would be exhausted

616
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:46,040
by at this point is all of the little whims that these companies have had over the years

617
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:50,780
to sell their operating systems you know Apple's experiment experimented with like Launch Center

618
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:54,560
and they have a handoff stuff where things popping up on your dock all the time when

619
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:59,720
you walk into the room and Microsoft has had just this last few years with Windows 8 and

620
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,520
the transition to touch and all of this stuff Cortana everywhere now the integration of

621
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:08,880
ads and Cortana into the windows and even just like to some of us it's just exhausting

622
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:14,400
these stupid bullshit names like the the fall creators update and all of these you know

623
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,640
corporate jerky little names that we all just get sick and all of that grades on your nerves

624
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,560
after a while or like today in the telegram group people were talking to somebody was

625
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,600
in there saying I just installed Windows 10 and now I'm spending two hours installing

626
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:30,060
updates and the way it just trickle feeds you the updates instead of just blasting them

627
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:34,880
on there like your package manager can these things drive you nuts after a while and you're

628
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:42,200
going to want to move to something that doesn't have this strategy tax and a pretty stock

629
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:49,240
gnome setup riding on top of a Debian or Ubuntu or an arch or Fedora is exactly that it's

630
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:53,760
not somebody's grand vision of the desktop it's not somebody trying to usher in a new

631
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:59,500
era of computing it's just here's a workstation OS if you don't like this one you can switch

632
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:04,000
to another one and you can still get your work done yep and that's what people that

633
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,920
are in the know want that's who our target audience is I think that goes right back to

634
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,800
what you were saying before you know just especially like even talking about in India

635
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:17,000
and China like we still need the desktop those things are still important but like clearly

636
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,680
Ubuntu has started you know decided that they want to focus as an organization on these

637
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:24,920
on these power users developers creators people who are using this you know in these worlds

638
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:29,000
and maybe there just isn't that kind of profit and momentum left in the desktop even if it

639
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,720
is still an important part of our mind share hmm all right anybody else in the mummer room

640
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,640
want to chime in before we move on I just thought we'd mention that totally wasn't going

641
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:42,520
to talk about today because didn't want to seem like a downer but I think it's I feel

642
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,400
like it is the elephant in the room right now it just feels like we gotta we gotta consider

643
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,600
that all of this if you're gonna be trying out bash by any chance or I would love to

644
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,340
hear more about people using that if you're new to that kind of stuff yeah really since

645
00:33:54,340 --> 00:34:00,160
I'm not trying it maybe I should well if you want a positive spin on the whole bash on

646
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:05,400
Windows they do you always always look at it from the point of view that now people

647
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:14,160
who are stuck with Windows can run all of the fedora Ubuntu and openSUSE a user space

648
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:21,280
tools that they want and they could just be using Windows as a shell to get at that stuff

649
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,480
yeah to make them productive well there I'd say the other positive things it does mean

650
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,120
more open source in the hands of more users right which is always good to makes it really

651
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:37,720
the barrier entries low and when they start using that stuff through WSL eventually will

652
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:43,480
get to the point that it isn't quite as seamlessly integrated and maybe they'll start moving

653
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:48,760
over to a proper operating system as a result C sharp you wanted to chime in actually Wimpy

654
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:54,040
just touched exactly on what I was going to say and just to elaborate more on it I think

655
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:58,320
it's basically just Windows compromising because it's not Linux and we're seeing stage two

656
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,480
we'll see a stage five and a stage six and then you know we'll have a bunch of Linux

657
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:08,360
users I could also make the argument I suppose that it's sort of like the same argument why

658
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:13,440
it's great that we have LibreOffice and Firefox and tools like that on Windows and Gimp and

659
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,260
etc etc etc because then when you switch over to Linux your same exact application sets

660
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:23,480
available so more maybe that could be even more true I think it's just one of these things

661
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:28,120
where I'll have to just watch and see where it goes while people are trying it out just

662
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:32,260
want to mention explain shell.com a few people share that with me this week and it looks

663
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:36,280
pretty cool you can write down a command line to see how it breaks out so for example say

664
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:40,640
you're maybe trying out the tar command for the first time well you can put the command

665
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:47,800
syntax in the explain shell.com box and it breaks down the entire command into really

666
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,560
easy look at that isn't that nice and easy to understand so you can see what each flag

667
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:57,560
does what the command itself does and it really helps you understand so that is explain shell.com

668
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:01,360
and then if you're having some trouble with some shell that you've recently written how

669
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:06,400
about shell check at shellcheck.net which finds bugs in your shell scripts and you can

670
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,120
also install it on the command line if you just want to install it locally yeah it's

671
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:13,600
like a handy dandy little winter for your bash scripts yeah which I find handy especially

672
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:17,040
if you like you only write bash scripts occasionally you come back and you're like did I use the

673
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,240
right number of brackets what's happening or you know you just want to maybe sanity

674
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,440
check a one that gets dropped in like a stack exchange thread or something like that I don't

675
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:30,000
know before you run it on your system yeah yeah yeah so I'm there you go there was therapy

676
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,240
with Chris about I think it's I think you guys are probably right and here's the other

677
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:39,180
thing even if even if we just say okay maybe these average consumers that we're always

678
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:43,160
talking about don't really exist for Linux the markets that do seem to be materializing

679
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:47,920
like the very kind of people that be buying this galago pro that is not only a growing

680
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,320
market but that's a good market to go after there is nothing wrong with that segment that's

681
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:57,040
a good thing right it really is and there are also people that are more able to tolerate

682
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:01,120
slightly rough edges or understand what an extension is to a gnome desktop environment

683
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:04,640
and those might be some of the best users to have in our fold because they might be

684
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:09,480
able to help fix some of those rough edges too oh man West that's a very good point so

685
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,600
there you go that's the positive take on the whole thing so go ahead Microsoft keep at

686
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,400
it keep at it and while I keep keeping at it if you're at this is what I would do if

687
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,640
you're having problems with your bash scripts you got problems with your shell script you

688
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:25,020
don't know how to do something Linux Academy is where you go linuxacademy.com slash unplug

689
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:28,240
sponsor right here of the unplug program and they've been here for a while I think it's

690
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,960
a great service and more and more of you are trying it out all the time you get started

691
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:38,160
by going to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged then you sign up for a free seven day trial

692
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,840
try something out now the thing that's great about Linux Academy is they have courseware

693
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:45,400
for every type of user if you're an experienced Linux user and you're ready to kind of step

694
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,200
it up to the next level on stuff they got courseware for you if you're brand new getting

695
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,840
started with something and maybe it's something that's not even specific to Linux maybe you

696
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:56,600
want to get your Linux basics or maybe you want to learn how to program in Ruby or a

697
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:02,800
little Python maybe you could become the next Google linuxacademy.com slash unplugged seven

698
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:08,560
day free trial here's something else that sets Linux Academy apart they have real instructors

699
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:14,680
real people can actually help you that's nice because it's not like this is your average

700
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:20,120
online courseware there's so many online training places where they'll have like a Linux course

701
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:25,560
or they'll have the Linux plus certification or we'll teach you an AWS course nobody can

702
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:29,400
match Linux Academy they got great courseware in AWS too and that is its own beast isn't

703
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,280
it isn't isn't that thing a beast and it's so nice to have an authority to go to same

704
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:39,080
with OpenStack especially with OpenStack's modular nature it's really nice to have a

705
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:43,480
place you can go where you can wrap your head around complicated topics in just like an

706
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:50,760
amount of time oh oh okay six hours six hours and I know Ruby I can do that math linuxacademy.com

707
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,720
slash unplugged comprehensive downloadable study guides servers that spin up on demand

708
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,360
when you need them and courseware that matches the distribution you have chosen just try

709
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:04,480
it all for seven days for free at linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and a big thank you to Linux

710
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,600
Academy for sponsoring the unplugged program if they can teach Chris Ruby then I mean anything's

711
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,520
possible that's very true hey how about a little admin and public service stuff for

712
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:20,080
the community Southeast Linux Fest is t-minus one month away and they're announcing that

713
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:25,040
the registration is up the schedules released and more so this I wanted to give a little

714
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,320
attention to now it's it's down in Charlotte North Carolina and they have it there at the

715
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:34,400
hotel it's always actually been a pretty pretty beloved one here by the crew I don't think

716
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,160
I've ever I don't think I've ever gone it's gonna be June 9th through the 11th this year

717
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:43,720
9th through the 11th of June so it's coming up pretty darn pretty darn soon like you know

718
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:51,080
a month at the Charlotte Sheraton Charlotte Sheraton say that three times yeah the Charlotte

719
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:55,000
the the Sheraton Charlotte Airport in Charlotte North Carolina there you go that's the whole

720
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,160
thing so I will say it does seem to like it's one of those things like they have a feels

721
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:04,080
like they have a similar energy to our dear Linux Fest Northwest you know yeah yeah there's

722
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:08,560
like they like their cousins yeah very much sister sister conferences yeah so check it

723
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:15,160
out and they also are on the tweeters if you like to tweet at se Linux Fest at se Linux

724
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:19,200
Fest if you want to follow them if you're gonna be in the area let me know it'd be

725
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,640
kind of cool that we want it I was thinking field report I'm Noah will probably go I should

726
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,600
ask him but I thought it'd be cool if people go to events like this and they're in our

727
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:32,920
JB telegram group that'd be a great way to meet up with fellow JB people live people

728
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:37,040
could post pictures of the of the fest while they're pictures of their beer and make us

729
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:44,320
all jealous yeah yeah yeah another piece of another piece of admin to cover here on the

730
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:49,560
show the new Linux unplug subreddit is officially launched look at that handsome devil talking

731
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:53,680
about it last week and it's happened we've already got people starting to go there and

732
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:58,440
submit stories thank you to everybody over there so it's a reddit.com slash r slash Linux

733
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:03,480
unplugged and look at that good stuff in there look at that right there about palazzo put

734
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:09,120
about the plasma 510 beta that survey we covered is already there wow dude that is nice look

735
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:13,500
at that story about Edward Snowden talking at the OpenStack summits in there as well

736
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:18,040
so all kinds of good stuff and the question about the studio I like it I like it thank

737
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:21,360
you everybody for helping us get the new subreddit set up for this show you can participate at

738
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:25,480

739
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:31,440
us live for the for the live virtual lug you could totally hang out with us on the subreddit

yeah that's like 24 7 you don't have to be here at any specific time for that so r slash

741
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:43,520
Linux unplugged it's kind of long that's what she said but hopefully it'll become a pretty

742
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:50,200
good community speaking of community holy cow the soundboard I was talking about recently

743
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:55,040
caster soundboard this thing is full-on nuts now this thing is I'll show it to you here

744
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:00,240
in a second just a reminder it's a it's a soundboard for podcasters written in c++ and

745
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:07,080
q5 and since last week I think or since the last time we've talked about it they've they've

746
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:11,800
they've added the ability to remotely control this thing over the network they've yeah they've

747
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:18,480
closed 16 features it's now feature complete and in beta that's awesome it supports the

748
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,480
open sound control protocol which I think I'm getting that right I don't even know what

749
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,920
that is but I'm excited there's a bunch of great open source and third-party apps like

750
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:31,040
available for your phone that you can install and control the soundboard from your phone

751
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:37,600
right isn't this wonderful you can they added the ability to duck all of the clips at once

752
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:42,160
they have app-wide ducking you can save an unsaved setups which is one of our original

753
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,820
big requests you can you can have hotkeys to fire off different things and it's been

754
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:51,240
added to the AUR which is totally totally awesome I think they've also added a jar jar

755
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:55,520
sub menu I don't know why we have a jar jar bink sub menu but we also I think they're

756
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,200
adding that so I wanted to show it to you so I have it installed if you guys are watching

757
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:02,640
the video version of the unplugged show I have it installed here if you're not listening

758
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:07,800
or if you're listening not watching what's up here is a tabbed interface I can have multiple

759
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:12,160
soundboard tabs and right now I have the Linux unplugged soundboard up and there's a couple

760
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,680
of sliders one is volume and one is position I can set different colors there are all large

761
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:21,160
touched objects so I don't have it fully maximized but so a picture it's even larger than what

762
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:25,120
would be on my screen the idea being that it's going to be on a Dell 21 inch touchscreen

763
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:29,560
so I can fire off all these either with a keyboard or with touchscreen because keyboards

764
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:34,900
when I'm sitting touch screens when I'm standing and we have of course names you can load files

765
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:41,560
in here it all it uses the local GTK open file even though it's a cute app look at that

766
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:46,320
that's super nice it like I was talking about just a just a moment ago it has the remote

767
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:50,600
control feature so with an open sound control server running on this you can do one way

768
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:56,800
or two way communication with this soundboard wow yeah which is great because you can have

769
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,560
somebody like yourself you could you know nothing we do in there but imagine like say

770
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:07,360
you went off to like to like some some conference in Seattle and you came back with some audio

771
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:10,480
you could be sitting there on your laptop and you could be firing off the clips of the

772
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,680
audio when you were ready for the press I don't it doesn't have to rely on me so in

773
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,960
the past that's awesome I you would have had to give me all the audio before the show I

774
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,700
would have to listen through it all to know when to cue it up and then I would have fired

775
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,000
off but now you could bring the audio in and you could fire it off that's amazing yeah

776
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,080
so that's something we could play with in the future they have the also added the ability

777
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:32,240
where I can grab the in and out part hi there you do that was good I was in and out yeah

778
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,960
all the same time I can grab the in and out parts of a clip I should do it I should so

779
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:40,120
I can pull down the volume right here so I do it again see it's quieter now and then

780
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:45,600
there is a isn't that great we also have app-wide ducking like I was talking about so it brings

781
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:51,640
everything down by 33 percent which is really cool I can tie I can drag it up a little bit

782
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:55,800
there so and then of course there is a global stop all clips button which is pretty cool

783
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,640
aka the shut up button yep and then I could just create more sound boards I could call

784
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:03,760
this one you know something that would be really relevant to the show and I can tab

785
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,200
through the different interfaces and have different boards loaded here save them out

786
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:12,400
import them out isn't this neat that is so awesome it's all all created by members of

787
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,680
their tool yeah it really is it is now it is beyond what the proprietary applications

788
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:22,560
on macOS could offer and a few short weeks all created by our community members for the

789
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:26,480
podcasting community so we have that linked up in the show notes it's sort of it's it's

790
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,960
a bit sorry about that loud noise the chat rooms give me a hard time but it's sort of

791
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:36,440
the it's sort of the coolest like little community project I've seen us work on in a while so

792
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:40,360
big thank you everybody on the github that is working you guys are awesome and we should

793
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:44,840
like I don't know we should like come up with a way to get you guys like beers or something

794
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:49,680
something yeah wish if I had if I had all of the monies in the world if I had all the

795
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,920
Bitcoin in the world I just fly people out and take them up from here for that I you

796
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:57,560
know if I could throw one more out there I would love to see if anybody has any interest

797
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:02,520
in working on another open source project it's an audio visualizer written in Python

798
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:08,240
it's a little gooey tool that renders visualizations on audio files now if you've ever watched

799
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:13,800
a video version of user air you've seen this this sucker in in action if you're watching

800
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:17,640
the video version too I have it I have an example up and essentially it takes an audio

801
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:24,080
input file and it takes a background image in and then it uses ffmpeg to render out a

802
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:29,080
video that matches the length of the audio file that has waveforms that match the audio

803
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:32,320
so that way you can put this up on you could put an audio show up on YouTube or put it

804
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:36,040
in an mp4 video feed or something like that and there's actually something there's a visualizer

805
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:40,720
there to look at that matches the vocals now the only problem with this is is it only does

806
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:45,120
this there's no variation we can do with it we can't put animation like we can't put a

807
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:49,280
movie file in the background even though ffmpeg of course supports all of this it's just the

808
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,780
rapper does not right and what we'd like to do is be able to have more variety so we could

809
00:46:53,780 --> 00:47:00,460
use it for Linux action news we could use it for user air and then other podcasters

810
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:03,340
could use it for their podcast and we could all look a little different we could all have

811
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:07,080
our own unique look to it so that's also going to be in the github that might be asking for

812
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:11,720
a lot really it's python and ffmpeg so it's it's pretty straightforward pretty awesome

813
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:16,200
and it's already up on it's already up on github just go pull it down right now and

814
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:20,440
so we're working on this and one of the one of the pushes for us to do this is we're trying

815
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:26,200
to decide as a network if we want to be the podcasting network that delivers you get a

816
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:31,080
show and you get it in any file format any way you want it so if you if you want to get

817
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:35,980
Linux action dues in a video file and watch it on your Kodi box you can do it if you want

818
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:42,280
to download an mp3 of Linux action show you or text app you can do it if you want an HD

819
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:45,960
video version of text app you can get it I want an opus file Chris well that's something

820
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:50,560
we are actually working on too and so it's going into this thing like what do we want

821
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:54,920
to be as a podcast or because it's much more feasible for us to say well this is an audio

822
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:59,000
show so we're just going to officially release an mp3 because then we can get actual tracking

823
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,280
numbers on it we can manage the feed simpler we know where to focus all of the ratings

824
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,100
and the reviews and the different podcast networks which makes a huge difference for

825
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:10,400
discover ability and it's less hosting for us and it's less time you're kind of more

826
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:15,240
in line with what a lot of other you know more mainstream podcasts do right in and and

827
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:19,360
a lot of quote-unquote platforms that are built to host podcasts are dropping support

828
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:26,620
for og and webm and so they're just essentially supporting mp3 maybe m4a and so we've been

829
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:29,720
trying to decide well what do we want to do is do we want to just continue to like rebuild

830
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:33,680
replacement platforms to host these files when these things shut down and pay for the

831
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:38,080
storage and pay for the time to upload it and encode it for the editor and like what

832
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:42,480
it or do we just want to focus we and we're trying to decide like we're trying to find

833
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:47,640
a really good balance here and this this this this open source project is actually the linchpin

834
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:53,240
to this entire thing because this audio visualizer allows us to put in an audio file put in a

835
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:56,640
good background which we would like to have more flexibility with and have a little more

836
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:00,600
flexibility with the visualizer and then we can put out a file that we're actually like

837
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:04,320
I tried it with Linux action news and nobody liked the video file like ever I thought it

838
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:07,400
looked okay but everybody's complaining on YouTube that it's giving them seizures so

839
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,580
okay all right we've got to come up with something better but you'd like to have like a first

840
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:16,040
class audio only yeah supported pipeline it makes it makes it when you produce a show

841
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:21,120
for audio it makes it so much better I it just it's I don't need to go into it but and

842
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:24,280
if you make a show for video and you produce it for video it makes a video show that much

843
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,760
better and that's how we're gonna do it but I still think we should probably try to make

844
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:32,000
everything available when whatever way people want it and this tool is sort of the tool

845
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,840
that I think is gonna allow us to build a production pipeline around that so we would

846
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:41,900
love the help if you are if you have the interest on the audio visual Python thing yeah so there

847
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:45,520
you go yeah that's true thank you ww thank you that does make me feel better a little

848
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:52,000
bit but I love him you know what I love him I just I just love him one other thing I want

849
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,520
to talk about because I think it could be interesting maybe down the road and how things

850
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:00,000
like this affect Linux users too it's only affecting Android users right now but Netflix

851
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:06,960
is confirming that it's blocking rooted and unlocked devices which could be pretty significant

852
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,420
down the road for potentially other other types of and I feel like especially for some

853
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:15,780
of our audience you know we more than a lot of other people perhaps are interested in

854
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:21,800
having rooted devices or other modifications yeah so I thought that was using this is kind

855
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:26,360
of something that I've kind of taken for granted that it'll just work yeah yeah they're using

856
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:30,400
the wild vine or wild vine wide vine wide vine is that what it is Google's yeah they

857
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,120
bought that company yeah yes yeah and it's a DRM technology that basically has like you

858
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:39,220
can pick your layer layer of security how trusted you want a device to be and Netflix

859
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:43,960
has chosen the trusted level that disqualifies rooted devices which may be more I could say

860
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:48,640
that the content partners Netflix works with probably force them to choose probably we

861
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:53,040
don't know probably yeah so it's an interesting thing with Android and one of the things that

862
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:57,600
we're gonna be talking about probably more next week is magic device tool which kind

863
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:00,640
of goes in with all of this so magic device tool we've talked about we've talked about

864
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:06,320
it before it's pretty straightforward and it's pretty easy to get set up on your machine

865
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:11,840
you know it is amazingly powerful it allows you to load Ubuntu touch and Ubuntu phone

866
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:16,280
you know on it like a Nexus 5 I think I might be wrong on that so if anybody like wimpy

867
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:19,640
or somebody in the mobile room knows correct me but I think I'm like the Nexus 5 you can

868
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:27,460
load Ubuntu touch Android lineage OS maru OS sailfish OS and Phoenix OS with this one

869
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:31,880
tool with this one tool so I downloaded it and I have it on my machine upstairs and I

870
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:36,920
got my Nexus 5 charging up and I think I'm gonna try lineage first oh nice yeah didn't

871
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:43,480
know what mr. Joe does I think so yeah I think so I and it's the one I hear the most in our

872
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:49,000
community too in terms of you weren't gonna go for the Ubuntu touch well it just might

873
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:55,440
make me sad yeah I also have been very much considering maru or maru OS yeah right which

874
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,760
is it's like Android but also Debian XFCE I have I don't know if it'd be helpful but

875
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:05,280
I have that adapter the oh yeah HDMI out I will try it then yeah if you remember to bring

876
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,520
that I'll go find it so anyways I'm gonna be trying to play around this and if things

877
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:12,540
work out we may get a chance to chat with the developer of the tool next week if all

878
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:17,880
things line up Marius who works on this says you might be able to make it next week and

879
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:22,400
I would be great timing if you guys want to try it out too and join us next week in the

880
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,920
mobile room I have a link to the magic device tool which is also there's a snap for that

881
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:30,080
although I tried to install it had some problems on arch but if you're using snap on Ubuntu

882
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,600
you're probably that's awesome mm-hmm that makes it so easy yeah and you know what I'm

883
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:38,240
gonna do once I rock that Nexus 5 once I rock that Nexus 5 with lineage I'm gonna put it

884
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:42,280
on ting that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna put it on ting you go to linux.ting.com to

885
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:46,720
save $25 off a ting device or if you bring one you just bring a ting device check their

886
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:52,000
BYOD page because they support CDMA and GSM if you just bring just bring it over and you'll

887
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:57,160
get a $25 service credit from ting now here's the killer thing and I was surprised I did

888
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:03,920
not realize this when I switched to ting average ting bell $23 so they're gonna give you a

889
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,880
$25 service credit it's mobile the way it should be you just pay for what you use and

890
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:13,340
that's it six dollars for the line and that's your usage on top of that no contracts nationwide

891
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:21,680
coverage pay for what you use with a really great dashboard check it out just go to linux.ting.com

892
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,480
and they got great devices too so if you want to be if you just want to grab one there you

893
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:30,000
can do that and if you get a like a Play Store device bring that over there if you get like

894
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,160
one of the Nexus devices or pixel you might take a look at what coverage is better in

895
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:40,440
your area because you could choose CDMA or ting I mean CDMA or GSM on ting they offer

896
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:44,040
both so many options you can just pick up a SIM card and then just put it in a device

897
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:48,880
that you picked up from the Play Store they also you can buy iPhones and motorolas and

898
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:53,000
all the you know like really nice devices like the high-end stuff and you know like

899
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,680
the stuff that's still pretty good phone but it's in the budget price range and then down

900
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:02,160
to like the flip phones holy crap holy crap yeah look at this the answer tell one touch

901
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:07,880
fling which is a flip phone but that could be kind of nice $20 see that's the thing like

902
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:12,400
$20 six dollars a month for the line yeah even if you break it or you just throw it

903
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,640
on the ground in spite like it doesn't matter wow it's so cheap it's amazing that is really

904
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:21,600
so game changer let's go over to linux.ting.com and a big thank you to ting for sponsoring

905
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:28,520
the program that is wow wow wow how do they even do that how do they how do they that's

906
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:32,880
their secret how do they even do it how do they even do it I don't even understand so

907
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:40,360
mr. West right here in our hot little hands is system 76 is galago pro and this is a pretty

908
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:46,360
pretty exciting rig a lot of people were drooling all over this thing at Linux fest Northwest

909
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:50,480
people were constantly stepping by that was the highlight of the system 76 booth yeah

910
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:53,560
people are stopping by they're constantly to look at this thing and I'm playing with

911
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:59,200
this ethernet port right like that so I've been I've been messing around with it and

912
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,360
getting a sense for what kind of machine it is and who I think might be really into it

913
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:06,500
and where I think would fit in with my workflow and I kind of I got like I still have thoughts

914
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:10,200
in fact I I'm probably gonna still kick it around for a couple of more days I'm gonna

915
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:14,640
send it back pretty soon because these are in-demand product so I'll just give you the

916
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:18,800
basics if you're not familiar the galago pro is a 13.3 inch machine that weighs around

917
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:26,480
like 2.8 2.9 pounds hmm port wise it has them it's really nice in 2017 to get a machine

918
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:31,320
with these ports it's got one USB C with Thunderbolt and I've been told it has four PCI lanes in

919
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:37,240
that USB C port yeah which means as each GPU support gets better on Linux you're gonna

920
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:42,120
get full you would get full eGPU support with four PCI lanes which is really nice like I

921
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:47,920
said it has Ethernet it has HDMI out it has an SD card slot and DisplayPort now one thing

922
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:51,360
that might throw you off and this is just my understanding at this time there is also

923
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:58,520
a here it is there's like a little like a little GSM SIM card slot but I don't think

924
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:03,800
the corresponding hardware is on the motherboard that's too bad geez excuse me I'm getting

925
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:10,360
over a cold from Linux test yeah so I don't I might be wrong you might also be able to

926
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:13,240
pop the bottom off and put something in there so it might not be a huge issue but I think

927
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:17,360
right now it's just a dead slot it really is a ton of ports though and it's like I'm

928
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:22,180
just not used to seeing that number on a laptop it's not three it's not four especially especially

929
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:26,560
one that weighs under three pounds yes so it's this one the one I'm using has a core

930
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:32,800
i5 or I'm sorry core i7 is 7500 running at about 2.7 or ish they change depending on

931
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:39,940
what you're doing two physical cores four logical cores Intel HD graphics 620 8 gigabytes

932
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:48,920
of RAM 256 gigabyte MV and me drive and a 36.2 watt hour battery so that is my test

933
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:54,040
config of the system 76 Galago Pro I'll tell you too one of the things besides the really

934
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:59,040
enjoying the ports and the availability of a DisplayPort in HDMI is particularly nice

935
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:03,760
and the USB C port is nice it does also have a barrel charger it does not charge over USB

936
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:08,400
C right and I asked this from 76 if they think that might be something future models might

937
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:13,280
offer and they're looking at that so that may be that would be nice the the barrel connector

938
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,840
is pretty straightforward and the power brick is pretty small it's like that one of the

939
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:20,200
smallest I've ever seen from system so that's dainty yeah power button here on the side

940
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:24,800
too mm-hmm which I kind of like it's just an odd spot but it's it's got it one of the

941
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,760
things they discrete one of things they've done is they built a delay into it so that

942
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,680
way if you like bumped it with your mouse or something it doesn't trigger it you have

943
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:34,760
to hold it for a few seconds which I actually think is a pretty good idea the case is is

944
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:40,720
pretty nice it's it's particularly nice from system 76 too and one of the things that I

945
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:45,400
think they've done above and beyond with the Gallego Pro is the way they've done the logo

946
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:49,560
in and I believe this is probably how they're gonna do it on future products as well it's

947
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:57,600
a aluminum or metal type casing and the system 76 logo is is is like baked into the housing

948
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:02,160
yeah you don't feel it at all it's just it looks really good I'd say it's it's pretty

949
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:07,200
close to the XPS line and build quality I'd say it's on par with most Lenovo's for sure

950
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:11,960
what do you definitely yeah yeah I mean it feels sturdy there's no bend right in it right

951
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,760
the hinges with the screen which is always something I'm worried about yeah that's rock

952
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:19,400
solid yeah in my opinion the screen really pops too do you feel like that yeah yeah it's

953
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:23,720
got it's it's not touch though right correct correct which I think actually a lot of people

954
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:26,560
might perhaps they're not interested in that a lot of times it takes away from battery

955
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:32,240
life and other things but it is beautiful and it's high dpi it is it's like it's it's

956
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:37,480
thirty two hundred by eighteen hundred I think is that right is that the yeah I think so

957
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:41,880
so yeah that's the so the screen I I've been pretty impressed with that there's a bezel

958
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:47,240
around it so when compared to the XPS 13 right it jumps out at you but it's not as bad as

959
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:49,720
most of the other systems like I'd say it's a smaller bezel than you'd have like on the

960
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:55,480
Apollo and it it all is the housing itself is pretty nice it's well balanced too like

961
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:59,120
you can have a nice laptop that's weighted really weird and hard to hold and carry around

962
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:03,680
but this is like it's portable yeah yeah I've had a couple of I've had a couple of complaints

963
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:08,280
with the fan noise and I think I kind of got from a from a conversation I had with system

964
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:12,600
seventy six that they're still tweaking the firmware a bit on the cooling like maybe the

965
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:16,520
fans kick in a little sooner than they need to yeah right so that was that was a potential

966
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:22,800
issue you know looking at this machine this was probably one of the hardest laptops I've

967
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:28,480
ever you know I think it was the hardest laptop I've ever reviewed and I'll tell you I couldn't

968
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:32,300
really wrap my head around why does this feel like it's so so hard for me to review this

969
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:37,960
laptop and I realized that we are in like a three-year transitionary period that's extremely

970
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:44,320
awkward we are transitioning well let's start with the one we just been talking about we're

971
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:49,480
transitioning on the Ubuntu side which system 76 ships we're transitioning to Gnome and

972
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:53,160
Wayland that's a big transition that's gonna take a few years to work everything out we're

973
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:57,520
transitioning to high DPI there's still a lot of little nigglies there that need to

974
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:05,680
be worked out we are transitioning from lots of different types of connectors to USB C

975
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:12,520
and Thunderbolt 3 hardcore making that pivot right like there are all of these are huge

976
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:19,520
transitions and that machine is a product of that that is on the outer rim it's it's

977
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:23,680
a machine that is if you're the type of person that likes to buy a computer that is going

978
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:27,500
to where everyone's eventually going to end up this is that machine so if you want a two

979
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:33,360
three four year work machine this is going to be that computer where in some sense it

980
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:38,120
would if you could have everything in the entire world you would probably have more

981
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:43,800
like a 70 watt hour battery and you would probably have maybe a slightly larger trackpad

982
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:48,760
and charging over USB C yep but that's just not where this market is at right now we are

983
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:54,480
in a transitionary period and if you need a good workstation that runs Linux right now

984
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:58,100
that is lightweight that's easy to say take on a plane and travel with that still has

985
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:02,280
some pretty great performance I I knocked on this thing quite a bit specifically today

986
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:06,280
before the show to try to get a sense of like what the battery life is under some significant

987
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:11,920
work so I not only did I just do like a lot of my general show prep web browsing writing

988
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:16,080
up notes on the show but I also ran a few for on expense marks low-level stuff that

989
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:19,520
just sort of kept the hard drive busy for a little bit did little things here and there

990
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:24,420
just to keep the machine average busy but not stress it out too much so so I could kind

991
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:28,660
of get an idea of what the performance of the battery would be like if I have Wi-Fi

992
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:34,400
on if I have the screen about 50% brightness which is still plenty bright it's plenty bright

993
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:39,760
at 50% brightness if I put it down to 50% I'm on Wi-Fi and I and I'm just taxing maybe

994
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:44,800
the disk subsystem for a bit and then the CPU for a bit and then just general browsing

995
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:51,260
I got about about three hours I think I could have got three hours and 50 minutes out of

996
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:55,720
it if if I wasn't pushing it quite as much if you weren't you but I wanted to simulate

997
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:59,960
more of a real workload for me now I am the kind of person that is sufficient battery

998
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:05,440
for me yeah me too I think I mean like four hours issues like a good target no I'm not

999
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:08,720
he's like one of these guys he likes a 12-hour battery yes because he doesn't like to charge

1000
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:11,720
his battery all day he likes to pretend like it's a tablet yeah even though he has docks

1001
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:19,440
everywhere so I was but I was actually I was more impressed with that than I expected I

1002
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:24,080
did have some issues initially with when I was first charging this thing up under stock

1003
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:29,840
Ubuntu reading the full battery life but then after I installed system 76 is PPA that that

1004
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:33,840
cleared up that pretty much became a non-issue the other thing I was considering too is I

1005
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:38,240
might be able to push it beyond four hours if I installed TLP oh yeah and configured

1006
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:43,520
that to like some just saying defaults so I contacted system 76 and I said are you considering

1007
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:48,000
shipping this laptop with TLP pre-installed it's not on the radar yet they're considering

1008
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,120
maybe some some tweaks like that but there's nothing like that yet they're gonna be shipping

1009
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:55,600
it with unity still by the way people have been a lot of people been asking me is it

1010
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:59,460
shipping with gnome and their new theme it is shipping with unity right now so I have

1011
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:05,000
it with the latest Ubuntu stable release with the system 76 PPA on there it is really snappy

1012
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,160
I gotta say yeah playing with it I played some race the Sun and other things and yeah

1013
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:11,580
and the thing is you're playing I mean I know this isn't like the most demanding game but

1014
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:16,680
you're playing race the Sun at 4k resolution on an Intel embedded graphics yes with a nice

1015
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:19,800
frame rate yeah so I'm gonna do some more gaming on it to just get an idea of where

1016
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:22,880
its limits are because I'm sure I'll hit them with an Intel graphics but it's nice to know

1017
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:27,860
that the desktop itself performs well and some basic games seem to be performing well

1018
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:33,360
even at high resolution yeah anyways so that's that's that's sort of my initial take on it

1019
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:38,080
so far but I wanted to touch on one more sort of concluding kind of thing that I've liked

1020
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:46,240
a lot about this laptop so for myself there's one thing that I always under sell myself

1021
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:51,280
on and it's it bites me every damn time need that Windows Pro license that's what it is

1022
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:55,960
right that CD key on the bottom that's what you want yeah man it solves so many problems

1023
01:03:55,960 --> 01:04:02,680
no it's the keyboard so many times I have under sold the value of a good keyboard to

1024
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:10,660
myself and it it it the cost is daily frustration when I use my machine like not quite as fast

1025
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:16,960
as I could be or my fingers still never learn the right position and it's it's it's so frustrating

1026
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:21,920
I always always feel like I can never quite get that balance right on a laptop and I think

1027
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:25,080
some people think system 76 is maybe missed the mark I think they've been better at it

1028
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:28,600
in the last few years this one out of all of the machines I have in the studio right

1029
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:34,120
now I can honestly tell you that this has the most comfortable keyboard now I don't

1030
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:38,000
have like I don't have a mechanical keyboard with brown key switches or whatever there

1031
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,760
I should come on clear clear okay all right okay see see apparently Wes knows I but I

1032
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:47,960
don't so I'm not comparing it to somebody's ultimate keyboard setup I'm comparing it to

1033
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:54,120
a bunch of Logitech keyboards in the studio a MacBook Pro keyboard a Logitech gaming keyboard

1034
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:57,540
that's what I'm doing laptop keyboards are the class of their own right like it does

1035
01:04:57,540 --> 01:05:00,560
have to be portable do you what are you now I've had you that's one of the things I've

1036
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:03,840
asked you to specifically sort of play around with since you've been in the studio today

1037
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:07,360
what are your thoughts on the keyboard I like it it's comfortable to type with you know

1038
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:11,960
it's not like the deepest ever but it's a key travel is nice and so like for me I have

1039
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:17,080
like a 17 character password for a lot of things like my main go-to password for things

1040
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:20,680
and on bad keyboards I can kind of tell it when I first got like the mechanical keyboard

1041
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:23,920
I have at home one of the first things I noticed was like I don't make mistakes typing this

1042
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,600
you know I type it like a thousand times every day same thing with this one like I can type

1043
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:30,760
that very reliably I'm not making mistakes and that's really what counts because like

1044
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:36,160
those backspaces are what really kill you yeah yeah that just shaving off those frustrations

1045
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:43,200
is really nice so I was I'm pretty I'm pretty impressed with it I found it to be exactly

1046
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:48,520
what you would want if you were somebody that wants to bust out a daily Ubuntu workhorse

1047
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:53,760
and get some work done and gaming is it's in the back of your mind but you're willing

1048
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:58,080
to sort of consider if I give it a few more months I could probably pick up an external

1049
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:03,040
GPU and when I met my desk I could game like I can't tell you that's gonna work with this

1050
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:08,320
I would love to be able to test that I just don't have an eGPU but I know that system

1051
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:14,240
76 specifically worked to make sure that this was a 4 PCI lane USB-C support and that is

1052
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:19,880
to me that is a very exciting future where you can have a ultra portable two two and

1053
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:24,880
a half to almost three pound laptop that has Ethernet by the way which I think is a real

1054
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:29,220
standout feature of this thing when compared to the XPS one of the things in my notes is

1055
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:34,840
like if you if you need an Ethernet port and I consider myself one of those people this

1056
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:38,520
is this is sort of one of your best bets at this size right so like for Noah that's a

1057
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:43,920
huge deal right so he doesn't want those dongles yeah I have settled with the dongles but I

1058
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:47,240
don't like it and so this would this would donk this would this would be a dongle is

1059
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:50,440
machine for me which I think would be pretty great but anyways if you're somebody that

1060
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:54,320
needs a machine like this this is a pretty good match for that the competition is stiff

1061
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:58,460
right now but I think they have a pretty solid offering with this I would really like to

1062
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:03,600
see system 76 stick with this machine over a few releases to keep iterating yeah eventually

1063
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:08,120
you know add in things like USB-C charging maybe actually get that SIM slot oh man a

1064
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:13,120
system 76 laptop with an active LTE SIM that I could pop in there oh that's amazing that

1065
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:16,800
would be the other thing too is like it's a handsome looking machine and I know it sounds

1066
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,680
silly but especially living in Seattle like I'd like to if I'm gonna be repping a Linux

1067
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:24,160
laptop I'd like to not feel like I have look worse than the MacBooks in the cop shop yeah

1068
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:28,240
you're gonna be competitive and that's why I think that logo on the lid is a kind of

1069
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:33,080
an important thing to mention I would tell you I would I would definitely if you could

1070
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:36,560
get your hands on one like at a convention tried it out try it out I'm hoping they work

1071
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:39,880
out the the firmware on the fan stuff that would be one thing for me that would be a

1072
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:44,080
little little bit of an issue but otherwise I really liked it I really liked it and I

1073
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:49,800
was also consistently surprised at how fast it was and today when I was when I was particularly

1074
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:54,720
trying to push it to kind of see what I could get out of it it's still the unity desktop

1075
01:07:54,720 --> 01:08:00,440
still remained responsive while I was slamming the disk or slamming the CPU like things still

1076
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:06,000
felt like they wasn't like my whole desktop was laying out on me and I think that MVNE

1077
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:11,000
is a big part of probably that performance story right yeah so check it out if you guys

1078
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,560
are curious you can find it over at System76 lots of reviews are coming online right now

1079
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:18,280
too I think people I think I saw somebody too is getting is receiving theirs or something

1080
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:25,120

1090
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:14,600
so we have to go kind of soon because the text that program is recording another show

1091
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:18,640
but I did want to give the mumble room a chance to ask any questions in the chat room if anybody

1092
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:23,480
wanted to ask any questions about the Galago while I have it here in my little hands go

1093
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:29,840
ahead anybody go on I'll go on twice are you a regular user of the touchpad on that thing

1094
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:34,000
or do you use a mouse I've been using the touchpad the whole time I have not actually

1095
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,560
hooked up to a mouse how do you feel about that compared to say the MacBook or the XPS

1096
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:42,280
13 well I think it's comparable to the XPS 13 I feel like the new MacBook is it's sort

1097
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:46,820
of that's a challenging thing to compare it to because it's so huge huge yeah trackpad

1098
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:51,360
on the MacBook is crazy nice yeah I would like to see the trackpad be larger I tried

1099
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:54,880
the Galago Ultra Pro at scale but it was before they had the final keyboard and it

1100
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:58,880
might have been before they had the final trackpad I would say I would so I was not

1101
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:03,440
impressed but I don't really have a lot of complaints the buttons aren't like super clicky

1102
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:07,200
to me but they're fine it's got dedicated buttons the touchpad itself the feel and the

1103
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:11,680
fact that the mouse didn't seem to move smoothly it's a little smooth for me you know like

1104
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:16,160
the feel of it I will also say I do like that it's small I guess like I like that the Mac

1105
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:21,040
one's big but Linux drivers have never been as good at the like you when you hit it with

1106
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:25,920
your thumb or I kind of small hands so it's like a giant touchpad hard for me so I kind

1107
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:29,840
of appreciate that this one's not huge yeah yeah chat room some people in chat room say

1108
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:32,760
the battery life isn't for them and that's just a decision you have to make for me two

1109
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:37,240
three hours when I'm working on it pretty hard is decent I blame some of that on Linux

1110
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:41,800
too I mean if you put Windows 10 on here maybe you get six hours I don't know it's possible

1111
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:44,560
maybe not either you're not gonna try that you're not gonna put Windows on the machine

1112
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:49,900
born to run Linux I did run Arch on it for quite a bit I ran Arch and I actually am planning

1113
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:55,240
to put elementary on here in a bit too yeah elementary and that would be a handsome combination

1114
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:58,720
yes what I was thinking any other questions everybody else got any other questions before

1115
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:04,120
we move on I don't know with William I really like the keyboard on this yeah what's the

1116
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:11,440
RAM on that this one you can go up higher so this 32 I think yeah the the review unit

1117
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:17,360
that I have has eight gigs of delicious tasty tasty RAM on it I also was considering although

1118
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:20,520
I don't have a lot of time with this unit I have to send it back I was considering popping

1119
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:23,760
off the bottom and seeing what the upgrade possibilities are you should post some of

1120
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:29,480
those pics on Twitter actually add the LTE modem yourself yeah it sounds like it's not

1121
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:32,960
in the skews they sell but I wonder if it's still on the board because it is you know

1122
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:39,200
a clevo unit or something originally I wonder I wonder I don't know since it has VMs just

1123
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:45,400
since it has 32 gigs do you see yourself running any VMs on it so this has a 256 gig hard drive

1124
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:49,160
but you could obviously put a larger hard drive in it if you wanted to because yeah

1125
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:55,360
you can get up you can get up to one terabyte MVM NVME if you wanted to actually they offer

1126
01:11:55,360 --> 01:12:01,480
up to two terabytes on the system 76 website two terabytes of MVM storage would be that's

1127
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:06,080
another part about this this nice it's like a very configurable laptop yeah that yeah

1128
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:10,540
you can put a dish you can put an additional disk in this compared to like like Dell's

1129
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:13,240
website where you have to there's like six different ways you can try to configure an

1130
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:19,720
XPS 13 and none of them have the same options you can put so you could put a if you wanted

1131
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:28,080
to you could put a 250 gig NVME drive as your OS drive and then you could put a one terabyte

1132
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:35,000
2.5 SSD in the second drive bay now you're editing video man well you are definitely

1133
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:40,080
getting VMs definitely that's your steam partition right there yeah yeah I would say for like

1134
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:44,600
that oh yeah it's got two DIMMs that's nice yeah you can get full 32 yeah you can get

1135
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:49,080
full yep yep I would say for that so if I was gonna build this for myself if I was gonna

1136
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:54,200
go nuts I would go with 1704 Ubuntu I would probably leave it at 3.1 gigahertz I don't

1137
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:59,440
need to blow that money I would probably get 32 gigs of RAM I would get a 250 gig OS drive

1138
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:04,800
I get a one terabyte SSD I would probably get the nicer Wi-Fi just throw that laptop

1139
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:10,720
back in there you need a new bag Chris so my total wow this is pretty reasonable my

1140
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:16,560
total for a pretty nicely specced 13-inch laptop with a 4k screen is 1800 bucks that's

1141
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:21,280
under 2k that is actually really reasonable 1900 you know probably if you know after there's

1142
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:25,720
some taxes or shipping or something I don't know but yeah that's really I mean compared

1143
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:29,640
to the like I mean I'm comparing to a MacBook there but well even on some of the like higher

1144
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:33,800
end XPS 15 or something like you're easily in that territory yeah yeah so you really

1145
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:38,720
what you have to decide is are you ready to switch to 4k on Linux that's one of the things

1146
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:41,280
you have to consider when you get the Galago Pro some of the things you don't think about

1147
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:46,960
there is like grub screens other things are kind of a pain sometimes yeah Java apps even

1148
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:50,840
steam on that like really yeah super small there is I've linked to it a few weeks back

1149
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:54,720
there is like a steam theme that helps with high DPI it just makes fonts a little bigger

1150
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:58,320
so you got to make that you got to make that call are you willing to be on a little bit

1151
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:01,160
of a bleeding edge and then understand too that we're about to go through the Wayland

1152
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:04,960
transition as well which probably should be fine for high DPI but just something to be

1153
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:10,680
considered of and if you are and you want a workhorse that's Heidi this at a laptop

1154
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:14,960
this is this could be a great one because it's fast enough to get work done and it's

1155
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:18,880
small enough to travel with you and light enough that you'll actually put in your bag

1156
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,220
that's pretty nice so they got a good mix there and I'd be curious to see if they stick

1157
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:28,360
with it where it goes especially when they start building these there you go ww you had

1158
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:36,400
a note go ahead oh no bashful was asking in chat and I don't think you got it he was wondering

1159
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:41,200
what was the heat output on it is it running too hot when you're using you know I wanted

1160
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:44,280
to ask that as well it's really not bad although I think part of that is the fan does seem

1161
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:47,000
to kick in a little sooner than it should and it does have I mean it does have good

1162
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,840
ventilation on the bottom it looks like yeah it really does it hold out this whole bottom

1163
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:55,760
piece is then this whole piece where like the motherboarded motherboard is is vented

1164
01:14:55,760 --> 01:15:01,560
and they have do have a fan there so I think I mean I would say I would say it probably

1165
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:04,980
has room to get warmer before the fan kicks and I think that's what they're playing with

1166
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:10,720
right now yeah if I could keep it for a little bit longer I would try a few different production

1167
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:14,000
things on it I would try editing doing some encoding on it just to give you that take

1168
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:18,040
two but in the meantime kind of give you an idea of where it's at yeah well hopefully

1169
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:22,200
if anyone out there buys one they'll let us know what they think of it too yeah we really

1170
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:26,320
it does seem like there's some pretty good interest here oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah

1171
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:33,040
yeah yeah it looks like Mr. Martin Wimperst had to part but you can find him and poppy

1194
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:06,780
want to talk about it but it just came up it just just happened so was there any push

01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:11,680
back on the name Linux action news was Joe like this is like where's my part of this

1196
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:16,000
no no I don't think so I think we're all I think we all liked it no it's a good name

1197
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,720
I like it too yeah I think it would I think it would pretty well I now we now we just

1198
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:24,280
need those Macs on eBay to sell so that way we can fund all the studio stuff that we changed

1199
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:30,160
here oh my gosh Wes oh my gosh it's a world of changes it's I mean it's all good right

1202
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:43,000
there ain't good I don't have to load any k kernel extensions on the Mac OS X anymore

1203
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:49,560
and yeah you don't have to like I keep trying to use like the long options on the BSD user

1204
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:54,120
list I like it because I'm up in my office and I'm listening to you and Dan on the live

1205
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:58,800
stream and I launched the editor remote program and I tweaked Dan's EQ a little bit since

1206
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:02,520
we changed this a little bit I never I don't have to come in and interrupt you guys like

1207
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:05,360
you're none the wiser I just get it done and I'll get in the way you guys just go about

top those Macs out Wes so everyone go go vote and then go buy some Macs yeah right go look

1210
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:41,520
for kernel Linux on even I'm sure he's on there and I'm sure you don't
