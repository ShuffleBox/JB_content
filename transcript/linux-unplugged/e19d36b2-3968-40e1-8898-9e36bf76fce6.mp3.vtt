00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Linux Unplugged, Episode 19 for December 17, 2013.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.780
Hi everyone and welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's wiped nearly

00:40.780 --> 00:43.240
every hard drive in the house trying out SteamOS.

00:43.240 --> 00:44.440
My name is Chris.

00:44.440 --> 00:45.440
My name is Matt.

00:45.440 --> 00:48.720
Hey there Matt, Episode 18 buddy and are you feeling holly?

00:48.720 --> 00:50.200
Are you feeling jolly?

00:50.200 --> 00:51.200
Are you checking your list?

00:51.200 --> 00:52.440
I'm checking my list.

00:52.440 --> 00:53.440
Feeling unplugged.

00:53.440 --> 00:54.440
Feeling verbal.

00:54.440 --> 00:55.440
You know?

00:55.440 --> 00:59.040
Yeah this would be a good one for folks to join us live because we're recording two episodes

00:59.040 --> 01:02.320
this week to make up for the holiday week because we want you to have some new shows.

01:02.320 --> 01:05.620
We know that just because it's the holidays doesn't mean you don't need your update on

01:05.620 --> 01:10.920
the weekly Linux issues of our day and on the pre-show it got a little lively.

01:10.920 --> 01:12.640
You know we were getting into it Matt but that's good.

01:12.640 --> 01:13.640
It opens us up a little bit.

01:13.640 --> 01:17.480
It kind of gives us some breathing room and I got a sandwich waiting for me in the other

01:17.480 --> 01:21.640
room too so that adds a little bit of edge to this whole thing because I know at any

01:21.640 --> 01:24.960
moment I could just be ripping into that sandwich but no I'm doing a Linux show right now.

01:24.960 --> 01:25.960
Nice.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.160
It's a sacrifice I make for the people.

01:28.160 --> 01:31.800
Well Matt this week we kicked off our SteamOS coverage.

01:31.800 --> 01:32.800
It's official.

01:32.800 --> 01:37.120
It's here in the Linux Action Show Season 30 Episode 1.

01:37.120 --> 01:42.160
Then in Coder Radio the topic came up again and we talked about the potential slight against

01:42.160 --> 01:44.200
canonical in the choice to go with Debian.

01:44.200 --> 01:48.560
So if you missed that discussion go listen to this week's Coder Radio.

01:48.560 --> 01:54.160
We have a pretty good robust chat in there about that whole aspect of it and some of

01:54.160 --> 01:59.080
the challenges that Valve face so that the conversation continues there and then today

01:59.080 --> 02:01.840
we're going to chat with our local internet lug.

02:01.840 --> 02:02.840
Is that even a thing?

02:02.840 --> 02:03.840
Can you have a local internet thing?

02:03.840 --> 02:04.840
Yeah I think so.

02:04.840 --> 02:05.840
Okay.

02:05.840 --> 02:08.560
We're going to.

02:08.560 --> 02:09.560
We just did.

02:09.560 --> 02:13.560
We're going to chat with them about their experiences experimenting with SteamOS and

02:13.560 --> 02:19.080
their thoughts on it too and the reason is I don't know actually on reflection for some

02:19.080 --> 02:22.080
days now I'm not sure SteamOS is going to be the biggest deal that we're all making

02:22.080 --> 02:23.080
it out to be.

02:23.080 --> 02:24.840
It's super important.

02:24.840 --> 02:28.880
But I don't know if it's like really baby Jesus coming down on like a unicorn from the

02:28.880 --> 02:30.280
clouds to save all of Linux.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.360
I think it's probably somewhere in between.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.680
We'll find out.

02:34.680 --> 02:36.540
But I want to start with our follow-up.

02:36.540 --> 02:42.680
Last week we had a great chat about the usefulness of Linux user groups you could say and the

02:42.680 --> 02:47.280
whole lug concept in general and that fired off some good feedback.

02:47.280 --> 02:51.480
The first one comes in from anonymous he says hey Chris and Matt and then he has engaged

02:51.480 --> 02:52.480
rant mode.

02:52.480 --> 02:55.920
When I go to a local hackerspace I meet the people who I know from local lugs which I

02:55.920 --> 02:59.040
think have stopped meeting altogether.

02:59.040 --> 03:02.580
When I first went to the lug and asked a question about Ubuntu the guy literally stopped me

03:02.580 --> 03:06.800
mid first sentence and pointed me to someone else from the Ubuntu loco who was there and

03:06.800 --> 03:08.960
told me never to ask him for help.

03:08.960 --> 03:12.760
I had to learn who would answer my questions and who wouldn't and to be fair there were

03:12.760 --> 03:16.760
those who were very helpful and explaining general concepts or solving specific problems.

03:16.760 --> 03:20.220
And you know you see this too right online like there's different personality types and

03:20.220 --> 03:23.080
some people are like oh Ubuntu?

03:23.080 --> 03:25.840
Yeah you need to go talk to the Ubuntu guys right and there's some people who are willing

03:25.840 --> 03:30.280
to help you regardless and there's just personality that I could imagine was even more exasperated

03:30.280 --> 03:31.280
when you meet somebody in person.

03:31.280 --> 03:35.320
Oh I imagine so and I never really understood that because I've seen I've seen people react

03:35.320 --> 03:38.960
to that and actually I've been the one that like swoops and this is wow that guy was a

03:38.960 --> 03:42.160
douchebag and comes in and actually tries to answer their question even though I may

03:42.160 --> 03:45.080
or may not be into whatever they're talking about yeah I try and at least not be a jerk

03:45.080 --> 03:46.080
about it.

03:46.080 --> 03:49.480
Right exactly like so you know you and I might go like every now and then we're testing

03:49.480 --> 03:53.360
a rig out and we're not doing the show be like oh geez Ubuntu like when you get all

03:53.360 --> 03:58.480
those app port air reports that just pop up constantly you know you go oh geez Ubuntu

03:58.480 --> 04:02.800
really you guys still do this but it doesn't mean you you refuse somebody help.

04:02.800 --> 04:07.600
He goes on to say however while the participants would humor me by having a basic noob conversation

04:07.600 --> 04:11.880
they tended to move on to exchanging information or having debates about advanced topics which

04:11.880 --> 04:13.760
was the reason they were there.

04:13.760 --> 04:18.520
Overall there seemed to be attitude of RTFM.

04:18.520 --> 04:21.280
Interesting right because you could see how you have a conflict there where there's people

04:21.280 --> 04:25.240
there that want to talk about system D they want to talk about C groups and they want

04:25.240 --> 04:29.160
to talk about the direction of the gnome project they don't really want to talk about how to

04:29.160 --> 04:35.960
get office running under wine so much and but there are people there that do and RTFM

04:35.960 --> 04:39.560
is a hard thing to just tell somebody but at the same time I often find myself saying

04:39.560 --> 04:43.080
well here's what you need to know go read this you know wiki entry.

04:43.080 --> 04:47.060
Exactly but there's two interesting challenges to the RTFM is one if you're having network

04:47.060 --> 04:51.640
issues and that's your only computer good luck with that and and two they don't really

04:51.640 --> 04:55.260
unless you know what to look for a lot of times finding the correct answer that isn't

04:55.260 --> 04:58.560
flooded with half answers is discouraging.

04:58.560 --> 05:02.060
Right right or out of date because things change really fast he says ironically the

05:02.060 --> 05:06.480
same guys who shut me down while at open source conferences extoled how employees at his company

05:06.480 --> 05:11.080
were being taught to use open source tools to answer questions as I listened to his answer

05:11.080 --> 05:14.040
I thought how more effectively he could address the person's questions if they learned how

05:14.040 --> 05:18.360
to teach i.e. how to impart information this is when I came to understand why my lug was

05:18.360 --> 05:23.240
bad at teaching all the gray beards were self-taught and expected everybody else to do the same

05:23.240 --> 05:27.440
his example was getting people to break their stuff but this is how I did it and this is

05:27.440 --> 05:32.400
the MS Word mindset he goes on to say my lug is YouTube now where the people who want to

05:32.400 --> 05:37.000
teach Linux topics in a nice clear way are at which is great for me because I learn way

05:37.000 --> 05:41.120
better being told something than reading it which is why I first started listening or

05:41.120 --> 05:45.640
going to the lug sorry lastly my local hackerspace has a weekly class on various topics where

05:45.640 --> 05:52.920
someone will say to me come join class X teaching is part of their DNA lugs can die as far as

05:52.920 --> 05:59.320
I care anonymous disengage rant mode so I I could be a bastard when I say this I get

05:59.320 --> 06:05.880
the sense that anonymous might be younger yeah I would say so that that's when the local

06:05.880 --> 06:09.800
lug here released back when I was still you know popping in and out occasionally your

06:09.800 --> 06:14.840
average age was at least in mid 40s if not maybe even a touch older but do you see like

06:14.840 --> 06:18.480
okay so I think for a younger person coming into it you you're dealing with people that

06:18.480 --> 06:23.720
are amazingly set in their ways but also there is value in being told to RTFM because if

06:23.720 --> 06:27.680
you learn how to research your own problem and solve them that helps you down the road

06:27.680 --> 06:33.180
and if I just tell you okay to update your DNS go edit your Etsy resolve dot comp file

06:33.180 --> 06:37.760
then that that gets you that immediate problem fixed but that doesn't teach you anything

06:37.760 --> 06:42.600
about how networking actually works on Linux true true but I also think it depends on what

06:42.600 --> 06:46.080
level of learning they're looking to do if they're actually looking to perhaps pursue

06:46.080 --> 06:51.260
this as a career or even a serious hobby absolutely yes if they're looking to just make their

06:51.260 --> 06:55.520
computer work you got to be kidding me you know I so I think that there's got to be there's

06:55.520 --> 06:58.880
got to be a balanced I think there should be a qualifying checkbox it says what's your

06:58.880 --> 07:02.600
what's your what's your long term goal so that we can help address this in a way or

07:02.600 --> 07:06.360
even find out if this is a place you should be lugs are really good for people that maybe

07:06.360 --> 07:09.880
are interested in pursuing something in a career fashion or serious hobby because that's

07:09.880 --> 07:13.680
what they are they're serious hobbyist they're not there to screw around right so and I think

07:13.680 --> 07:17.000
YouTube is a much like the stuff I used to do is definitely for people are there to screw

07:17.000 --> 07:20.480
around and that's okay right and there's such a wider variety like you have people they're

07:20.480 --> 07:24.400
teaching the super basic stuff you then you have people like us who are kind of doing

07:24.400 --> 07:28.500
more of the current events how news and digging into stuff right so there's a there's a wider

07:28.500 --> 07:34.200
range of availability but I also kind of felt like our anonymous writer here wasn't fully

07:34.200 --> 07:38.320
appreciating perhaps some of the lessons their gray beards were trying to pass on to him

07:38.320 --> 07:41.040
and it's not so much they're trying to blow him off and get rid of them is that they're

07:41.040 --> 07:45.640
trying to give him you know you filled saying you can lead a horse to water right that saying

07:45.640 --> 07:48.640
right they're trying to they're trying to or you can you know you can teach a man to

07:48.640 --> 07:53.360
fish they're trying to teach him how to fish basically is what I yeah I think and I totally

07:53.360 --> 07:57.640
get that but I think that goes back to why star public school systems as a joke in my

07:57.640 --> 08:02.440
opinion is because it's it's this one way fits all crap and it doesn't work that way

08:02.440 --> 08:05.800
you know and so I think I think that we need to really establish right there at the door

08:05.800 --> 08:09.040
right there when I first come in have a sheet that says let's make sure we're not wasting

08:09.040 --> 08:12.880
everyone's time and that's very gray beard and approach because it's very much you know

08:12.880 --> 08:17.840
it's me me me all about me and you know that's fine and to defend our writer he said you

08:17.840 --> 08:21.160
know he's better at visual and audio learning than he is at reading learning so when you

08:21.160 --> 08:24.640
tell him to go read something he just doesn't retain it as well and there's completely on

08:24.640 --> 08:27.680
the writer's side I think that I think the person who wrote the letter is spot-on correct

08:27.680 --> 08:34.000
I think that the entire experience sucked for him I totally do yeah all right well Miles

08:34.000 --> 08:39.640
writes in on the same topic this is a bring one of those gray beards you speak of and

08:39.640 --> 08:43.840
a lug member for 20 years and I could bean he says I think you meant to write I can say

08:43.840 --> 08:48.840
that lugs have lost some appeal but also many of us still enjoy the direct people contact

08:48.840 --> 08:55.840
they can offer our lug is full of former punch card cowboys but we also have many younger

08:55.840 --> 09:00.840
and father child members who bond over the talks and that that last cool that struck

09:00.840 --> 09:04.200
a chord me I could see that right because sure you know you're teaching a bit of the

09:04.200 --> 09:09.800
culture and in your like so I was thinking about my son Dylan if I was teaching him about

09:09.800 --> 09:14.640
Linux there's only so much realism there is when you're just showing him stuff on the

09:14.640 --> 09:17.680
internet and you're talking to him about it but when you actually go to other people and

09:17.680 --> 09:21.520
you see what they're doing and listening to their experiences what they've tried what hasn't

09:21.520 --> 09:28.560
worked it's much more tangible and I think for perhaps getting somebody into it that

09:28.560 --> 09:32.920
could be beneficial he says our topics are not just straight Linux but other technologies

09:32.920 --> 09:38.160
as well it also provides a great opportunity as a technical forum of toast masters for

09:38.160 --> 09:43.320
many who to develop public speaking and presentation skills interesting good point yeah that is

09:43.320 --> 09:46.400
you know because right because you got to go there maybe you're gonna do a talk on on

09:46.400 --> 09:50.660
on Docker and you know you have to learn how to present and you can then take that skill

09:50.660 --> 09:56.440
and apply it to your job or whatever you a podcast or whatever it is lugs are still valid

09:56.440 --> 10:02.280
and relevant resources but like anything worth it you get out of them what you put in I drive

10:02.280 --> 10:07.820
two hours each way to mine every month and I still get something from every meeting that's

10:07.820 --> 10:12.240
cool but it sounds like that this is not only a person that's well matched to to a log but

10:12.240 --> 10:16.360
they're well matched to their look that's fantastic right yep I agree and it's cool

10:16.360 --> 10:20.100
that was good perspective from miles so I appreciate him writing that in definitely

10:20.100 --> 10:24.040
all right Matt well uh we'll get a little loop in our our mumble room on their thoughts

10:24.040 --> 10:28.520
on the topic but before we get to that I want to thank our sponsor this week and that is

10:28.520 --> 10:33.440
ting.com now ting is mobile that makes sense my mobile service provider and Matt's mobile

10:33.440 --> 10:38.520
service provider oh yeah Matt we are liking ourselves the ting why I'll tell you why no

10:38.520 --> 10:44.400
contracts no early termination fees and you only pay for what you use picture it now people

10:44.400 --> 10:48.400
you go over to Linux dot ting.com which will save you twenty five dollars off your first

10:48.400 --> 10:53.840
device or twenty five dollars off your first month if you have a sprint compatible device

10:53.840 --> 10:57.920
and look through their devices they have some great ones and what's awesome is not only

10:57.920 --> 11:00.720
do you get a discount applied to them but they also have additional discounts on some

11:00.720 --> 11:05.640
of them and you will own this device outright this is yours now just like when you buy a

11:05.640 --> 11:11.900
laptop or you buy a desktop or a tablet you own that it's not subsidized and by the way

11:11.900 --> 11:17.320
there was a great piece I don't remember by which publication but you can look it up I'll

11:17.320 --> 11:22.600
try to link to it in the show notes about the massive marketing and surveillance program

11:22.600 --> 11:26.600
that some of the telcos have this is one of these things that gets really creepy and really

11:26.600 --> 11:32.920
shady and you never know what is being installed on your device and Verizon is the worst they

11:32.920 --> 11:38.820
they have a system that is optimized at for example if you like to go to a local sports

11:38.820 --> 11:42.720
game they will determine if you're somebody who drives home immediately afterwards or

11:42.720 --> 11:46.720
if you stop by the bar first and then they'll try to tailor the marketing they'll sell that

11:46.720 --> 11:51.060
information and try to tailor that marketing to you which is pretty creepy and these kinds

11:51.060 --> 11:56.840
of things are are possible because they own the software stack on that phone they own

11:56.840 --> 12:01.040
the device they're lending it to you and they are they are getting money out of you every

12:01.040 --> 12:05.160
single month for that and they also own the software stack on that now I don't know about

12:05.160 --> 12:09.620
you but I would never buy a computer that I did not have administrative root access

12:09.620 --> 12:13.160
over and that's what happens when you buy one of these phones directly from these carriers

12:13.160 --> 12:19.080
well ting is enabling you to buy a nexus directly from Google Play and bring it over to the

12:19.080 --> 12:23.240
ting network and then you only pay for what you use you have no contract and no early

12:23.240 --> 12:27.760
termination fees that's a huge deal because that's exactly how it should be as we become

12:27.760 --> 12:31.880
more dependent on these devices this is going to become more and more critical but not only

12:31.880 --> 12:36.120
that ting is only six dollars flat rate per month and then it's just they take your minutes

12:36.120 --> 12:39.020
your messages and your megabytes they add them up at the end of the month whatever bucket

12:39.020 --> 12:44.920
you fall into that's what you pay hotspot tethering caller ID voicemail all included

12:44.920 --> 12:49.600
with the plan if you turn on hotspot and tethering you just pay for the data usage you don't

12:49.600 --> 12:53.360
have to be in some sort of special family shared tier or something like that it just

12:53.360 --> 12:57.980
works so go over to linux.ting.com to get started and by the way if you're in a contract

12:57.980 --> 13:02.160
right now hit that how much would you save button find out how much you would say by

13:02.160 --> 13:06.080
switching to ting and then they're going to help you out with your early termination fee

13:06.080 --> 13:10.040
they will pay up to seventy five dollars per line that you need to cancel I love the Nexus

13:10.040 --> 13:14.040
five I've also got the HTC one Matt has the note two and Matt how much do you love that

13:14.040 --> 13:17.680
big screen I love the big screen as a matter of fact it's my go-to phone at this point

13:17.680 --> 13:21.200
because everything's so big and bright and crisp and clear it's great and they're taking

13:21.200 --> 13:26.480
they're there so if you combine the thirty one dollar discount that they have on the

13:26.480 --> 13:31.400
note two right now plus our twenty five dollar discount you can buy the note outright you

13:31.400 --> 13:35.460
completely own it for six hundred dollars now think about this because this is something

13:35.460 --> 13:40.240
that all of the cell phone companies I bet if I could make a little 2014 prediction I

13:40.240 --> 13:44.960
would bet you that the higher end phones on the cellular networks will lose their subsidized

13:44.960 --> 13:50.680
status in 2014 both the two biggest wireless carriers in the United States have stated

13:50.680 --> 13:54.360
they want to discontinue subsidized plans now our friends across the pond are rolling

13:54.360 --> 13:57.320
their eyes like yeah you guys are just now catching on to this here in the States the

13:57.320 --> 14:01.400
subsidized things has been going on for a while right but it sounds like it's coming

14:01.400 --> 14:05.520
to an end so get ahead of the curve start saving money now switch to Ting and you'll

14:05.520 --> 14:11.040
thank me later go over to linux.ting.com and a huge thanks to Ting for sponsoring Linux

14:11.040 --> 14:16.840
Unplugged. Love those guys. Love it Matt. You know what let's give that a ding. Ding.

14:16.840 --> 14:24.200
A ding for Ting. Fox News alert. We're bringing in the the mumble room right now and I just

14:24.200 --> 14:28.520
wanted to kind of let's start with this topic mumble room. Popey you brought up the whole

14:28.520 --> 14:34.280
topic of lugs last week and I don't know what your thoughts are on it from now but here

14:34.280 --> 14:38.040
we've heard two different perspectives. We've heard from possibly a younger guy who says

14:38.040 --> 14:41.840
I was I got basically told RTFM and we've heard from an older guy who says he gets a

14:41.840 --> 14:48.120
lot out of it. Are lugs maybe just not the appropriate place anymore for basic user support?

14:48.120 --> 14:53.320
It's funny you should you should mention the RTFM thing. We see a bit of that on my on

14:53.320 --> 14:59.240
my lug and you know grumpy old people or the gray beards or whatever you want to call them

14:59.240 --> 15:03.720
and one of the things when the and you also mentioned locos when the Ubuntu loco teams

15:03.720 --> 15:09.360
was set up one of the kind of not a rule but a recommendation was that you don't throw

15:09.360 --> 15:15.400
an RTFM at people and you don't throw a let me google that for you link at people because

15:15.400 --> 15:20.760
it's just rude. It's okay you could argue it's teaching someone to fish but actually

15:20.760 --> 15:24.800
you could say here's the answer to your actual question and by the way you'll find that in

15:24.800 --> 15:29.380
the map. I agree but is that because and this is a question for Alan is that because the

15:29.380 --> 15:33.520
Linux documentation and whole is kind of asked compared to something like the FreeBSD handbook

15:33.520 --> 15:39.440
so example if I ask Alan how do I do X in FreeBSD if he tells me go read it on the FreeBSD

15:39.440 --> 15:44.680
handbook I don't really consider that a disservice because the FreeBSD handbook is easily available

15:44.680 --> 15:49.160
it's well documented it's well laid out it's an official source so Alan when you sit there

15:49.160 --> 15:52.960
as a FreeBSD user watching us Linux users try to help each other's problems do you see

15:52.960 --> 15:57.760
this as a major hole in the Linux ecosystem partly but one of the biggest difference I

15:57.760 --> 16:02.680
would say is I would take the time to point you to the section of the handbook right thank

16:02.680 --> 16:10.600
you because it has the we do the anchor tags I can point you to like the chapter 24.7.3

16:10.600 --> 16:15.400
that explains exactly the answer to your question rather than just telling you go to FreeBSD.org

16:15.400 --> 16:19.400
slash handbook right and find which is what I'm saying that's exactly the same as what

16:19.400 --> 16:23.400
I'm saying point someone to exactly the piece of documentation okay but here's the problem

16:23.400 --> 16:27.120
though it's like they could have googled it as quickly as I did but or maybe not as quickly

16:27.120 --> 16:33.640
I know all the chapters of the handbook and where to look yeah but like what is it though

16:33.640 --> 16:37.680
so let's let's you could probably pick on the arch wiki but let's pick on the Ubuntu

16:37.680 --> 16:41.560
wiki because I've noticed it this week as I was running this leopard extreme is sometimes

16:41.560 --> 16:47.180
I go to the Ubuntu wiki and stuff is literally written for Ubuntu 9 something and it quickly

16:47.180 --> 16:52.800
falls out of date and I feel like this is this this wiki creep is a common problem for

16:52.800 --> 16:57.520
Linux and I think it aggravates the problem of not being able to tell people to RTFM because

16:57.520 --> 17:03.800
the truth is RTFM might not give them the right information and that's why one a little

17:03.800 --> 17:08.440
while ago one of the UDS is George Castro who works for canonical gave a talk a lightning

17:08.440 --> 17:13.860
talk that we're doing a disservice to our customers and our users by having old out

17:13.860 --> 17:18.840
of date information on the wiki and on forums and you know various web pages on blogs as

17:18.840 --> 17:22.440
well you might think you're you're doing a great service to write a blog post but when

17:22.440 --> 17:26.680
you don't update that in three years time that's bad because people still go back to

17:26.680 --> 17:30.080
it because it's got certain keywords that they're looking for and it might it might

17:30.080 --> 17:35.320
not be up to date so his his recommendation was to go through the wiki and delete pages

17:35.320 --> 17:40.320
that just are wrong just delete them get rid of them just expire them essentially completely

17:40.320 --> 17:45.760
delete them because when they show up in Google search results that's worse than no answer

17:45.760 --> 17:49.280
showing up because you're leaving you know you're telling someone to use it in this wrapper

17:49.280 --> 17:55.480
with the broadcom whatever that actually could make their experience worse than it not working

17:55.480 --> 17:59.320
you know what you could do their machine up other wikis have it where if it's an old

17:59.320 --> 18:04.040
an old note that it will an old old post that gives you a big a bad tutorial from like three

18:04.040 --> 18:07.480
years ago it was good then but now it's awful they'll have a note that says this is just

18:07.480 --> 18:13.260
how many years old or whatever here's the newer version this is targeted for you know

18:13.260 --> 18:20.040
x release and you know click here for maybe the updated releases the current stuff gets

18:20.040 --> 18:25.720
buried under all of the old information it's really difficult sometimes to find up-to-date

18:25.720 --> 18:31.000
information for the current release well you just that's just seo you do canonical that's

18:31.000 --> 18:38.980
a Google problem that's Google's not the company right but older pages that have gotten more

18:38.980 --> 18:44.800
clicks always have you can't always control how Google ranks this stuff right you can't

18:44.800 --> 18:51.720
you control like based on somebody searches for something if they click a link and then

18:51.720 --> 18:54.960
don't come back and keep searching Google assumes they found what they're looking for

18:54.960 --> 19:01.360
and now increases the rank of that page like that interesting yeah one of the ways we fixed

19:01.360 --> 19:07.080
it or we think we've fixed it partially is to switch to using askabuntu stack exchange

19:07.080 --> 19:12.680
outside is better because there's a few ways that fix it one way is it's not a wiki that's

19:12.680 --> 19:20.800
got some onerous barrier to edit pages you can easily tag things and say well this works

19:20.800 --> 19:26.360
on 904 and 910 and oh hey it works on 1204 and you know whatever release as well and

19:26.360 --> 19:32.200
rubbish gets buried and good answers get voted up just like reddit you know the good stuff

19:32.200 --> 19:38.360
bubbles to the top there is a negative to it though what's that like for example just

19:38.360 --> 19:44.320
I run a work on a project for a download manager and if you go to askabuntu and you search

19:44.320 --> 19:50.080
for you say you ask any question about a download manager they will say that this question is

19:50.080 --> 19:54.980
a duplicate and send you to another question that has about 30 answers and 10 of those

19:54.980 --> 20:00.700
are valid but not specific to what they want duplicate duplicate duplicate duplicate expand

20:00.700 --> 20:04.800
on that too I found that I would agree that it is vastly better than the wiki system no

20:04.800 --> 20:08.720
question about it it's like reddit I love that part of it my only gripe is that a lot

20:08.720 --> 20:13.200
of the stuff that gets voted up is crap because a lot of times it's like it's technically

20:13.200 --> 20:18.200
the correct answer but honestly sometimes so the answers are so overkill that they turn

20:18.200 --> 20:22.800
you new users off and I have an inbox full of people screaming for help daily from a

20:22.800 --> 20:26.320
boon to user so that to kind of testify to that so I think it's the right approach I

20:26.320 --> 20:33.160
just want to see more vetting setups though because like the question and answer format

20:33.160 --> 20:40.120
works great especially when somebody has a question and so it it works better than regular

20:40.120 --> 20:43.400
documentation for answering that question right but if you just want to learn more of

20:43.400 --> 20:48.920
a tutorial style or yeah like a corporate style you're gonna have the entirety of how

20:48.920 --> 20:54.120
to do something the question and answer style doesn't work as well so that's what you kind

20:54.120 --> 21:00.480
of need both right something like the handbook which is very like old-fashioned manual these

21:00.480 --> 21:06.320
are the steps you go through to do these type of things and as well the question answered

21:06.320 --> 21:10.960
because people want you know when you have a simple question you don't want to know all

21:10.960 --> 21:15.720
the steps to do X you want to know what's the answer to Y right and you want and that

21:15.720 --> 21:20.800
would that was popular on forums you know people would write a tutorial for you know

21:20.800 --> 21:26.840
how to get your Broadcom wireless working on like 1104 and that would get loads of thanks

21:26.840 --> 21:31.420
or whatever hearts or diamonds or whatever people give to people on forums and then you'd

21:31.420 --> 21:36.360
find there would be a flurry of activity lots of replies and oh you might want to tweak

21:36.360 --> 21:40.920
it for this in this use case and so the original poster would update their their post and it

21:40.920 --> 21:45.720
would it would be golden for a few months and then you find loads of replies and there

21:45.720 --> 21:51.600
be pages and pages and pages of replies and it would then be orphaned and nobody can edit

21:51.600 --> 21:57.000
it to fix it and anyone anyone who comes to that tutorial will find pages and pages and

21:57.000 --> 22:02.400
pages of you know people arguing whether it works or not and then on the very last last

22:02.400 --> 22:06.600
but one page is the final nugget of information that actually tells you how to make it working

22:06.600 --> 22:11.200
on your release and that's just terrible as well I mean they've all got their own you

22:11.200 --> 22:16.480
know disadvantages and I don't think every one of them is a is a magic bullet and exasperating

22:16.480 --> 22:21.200
need all of them exasperating the problem is a lot of these and this can be sometimes

22:21.200 --> 22:25.760
a problem on askabuntu because it's more user generated is a lot of times there's a the

22:25.760 --> 22:30.200
answer is a copypasta where you know add this to your sources list and then do an app get

22:30.200 --> 22:34.400
and import this GPG key which by the way by the time you're reading that that app repo

22:34.400 --> 22:38.200
is completely dead right like and this bit me with handbrake I wanted to get the absolute

22:38.200 --> 22:42.160
latest build of handbrake I eventually just downloaded the debt but I wanted a PPA so

22:42.160 --> 22:47.580
that way I could have a nice currently updated handbrake but of course I ended up getting

22:47.580 --> 22:51.520
the repo that was totally dead and so now and it's not a big deal I can go you know

22:51.520 --> 22:55.840
pull it out of my sources list but I get errors every time I get update now for a casual user

22:55.840 --> 23:01.280
who's just doing a little copypasta and and you know and adds that repo that PPA and applies

23:01.280 --> 23:03.780
that update all of a sudden they're getting errors and they don't really know what the

23:03.780 --> 23:08.360
hell is going on and it's I don't know how to solve it completely other than you know

23:08.360 --> 23:13.000
that we're at least seems like we're on the right track and then also it's maybe if we

23:13.000 --> 23:17.920
could have if we could have do a better job at informing people at the beginning of the

23:17.920 --> 23:23.740
gate like cuz perhaps really we solve this problem years ago with IRC like the maybe

23:23.740 --> 23:28.740
the you know they ask the the the Ubuntu support chat room is a better place to ask ask these

23:28.740 --> 23:33.640
kind of things but users just don't even know those things exist I think I think the Linux

23:33.640 --> 23:38.840
community actually is really to blame here I mean a user joined the IRC and was asking

23:38.840 --> 23:45.460
about their bootloader and they kind of got some help but the IRC community had a massive

23:45.460 --> 23:50.020
tangent about where to use syslinux or grub and then you just left the channel with no

23:50.020 --> 23:56.520
help whatsoever right yeah no erupts in some sort of religious war over grub vs. lilo history

23:56.520 --> 24:00.460
no one cares about I mean it's like yeah yeah or you end up at the same problem you have

24:00.460 --> 24:06.040
with a lug right lugs trying to build membership and get people to come every week but or every

24:06.040 --> 24:11.000
month or whenever the meeting is but if people if there's new people asking the same question

24:11.000 --> 24:15.760
every single week are you gonna spend you know a half of your meeting every week covering

24:15.760 --> 24:22.760
the same let's this is how you install Ubuntu it's it's hard on to keep people coming back

24:22.760 --> 24:27.480
it burns them out that just gets boring the whole IRC thing though is people just need

24:27.480 --> 24:33.280
to get better mods in the irc's that's it's that simple because like I mean there's people

24:33.280 --> 24:39.600
are donating their time to try to help you know you can only expect so much from them

24:39.600 --> 24:44.560
well I mean when there's thousands of people like in the Ubuntu IRC and they're just having

24:44.560 --> 24:49.720
an endless conversation about grub vs. lilo and somebody's needing help a mod chances

24:49.720 --> 24:54.400
are a mod sees that and just doesn't do anything no I mean technically most of the time in

24:54.400 --> 25:00.920
Ubuntu when they'll tell them to go into off topic channel and like there's because like

25:00.920 --> 25:04.520
the help channel for Ubuntu is just for help and when they start talking about which is

25:04.520 --> 25:09.540
better blah blah they say go to the off the off topic maybe maybe Google help out solves

25:09.540 --> 25:17.540
this problem sorry go ahead we've had a couple of community guys in the UK who've tried doing

25:17.540 --> 25:23.480
help outs and I know there's more people who want to do help outs but because they're rate

25:23.480 --> 25:28.240
limiting you know the invites to do help outs that makes it very hard for us to evaluate

25:28.240 --> 25:31.600
whether it's a good tool or a bad tool but the guy who's been doing it mostly in the

25:31.600 --> 25:36.560
UK guy called Matt has has has found it quite successful and had great conversations and

25:36.560 --> 25:43.660
he does it all for free oh really I was gonna say is he making money yeah his his his philosophy

25:43.660 --> 25:47.720
is I learned all this from other people who gave me the information for free so I'm just

25:47.720 --> 25:53.880
passing it on for free all right all right yeah I feel like a jerk wouldn't it be kind

25:53.880 --> 25:57.880
of good I feel great because I'm getting a wiki system where you could vote like on ask

25:57.880 --> 26:03.800
Ubuntu and newer votes well you can actually on ask Ubuntu you can convert a page from

26:03.800 --> 26:07.480
a question into a wiki page so if it does if it is a like a discussion like should I

26:07.480 --> 26:12.780
get an NVIDIA or an AMD card that's not a technical you know how does how do I get the

26:12.780 --> 26:17.960
latest driver that's a you know opinionated question so you can convert pages from questions

26:17.960 --> 26:23.640
into wiki pages which multiple people can edit I feel like I think that one of the problems

26:23.640 --> 26:29.400
with newbies is that for me that I'm not from an English-speaking country I often don't

26:29.400 --> 26:36.560
even know how something is called and I prefer RC and just say you know that stuff when system

26:36.560 --> 26:43.720
starts up not boots up because I don't know that it's easier in the RC and I think that's

26:43.720 --> 26:49.960
so basic that someone can can help me with that from the top of his head yeah yeah that's

26:49.960 --> 26:53.280
a good point good point good that's good perspective too because I didn't even think about the

26:53.280 --> 26:57.320
challenges when you don't quite know what it's called or how to say it that just it's

26:57.320 --> 27:02.680
a whole layer of complexity on top of that what about okay what about something like

27:02.680 --> 27:07.240
a community that was really focused and a large community of you know maybe several

27:07.240 --> 27:13.000
thousand Linux users who was really focused on being that front line of support that people

27:13.000 --> 27:17.040
could come to and it'd be great if there was a way to monetize it for some folks too so

27:17.040 --> 27:22.000
maybe they could make a little money on it money talks yeah maybe it's a Bitcoin tip

27:22.000 --> 27:27.280
system maybe it's a maybe it's like a flatter type system but it'd be you know remember

27:27.280 --> 27:32.080
like Linux questions org and a lot of those kinds of sites wouldn't it be awesome if like

27:32.080 --> 27:36.520
if there was a full-fledged like there was video and audio and forums and and and by

27:36.520 --> 27:41.000
forms I mean something like the ask a bunch to type stack exchange type system I think

27:41.000 --> 27:46.180
that would really if like if that became known almost as like a brand this is this is the

27:46.180 --> 27:51.080
brand of an organization of people who help Linux users and then if somehow that became

27:51.080 --> 27:54.920
popular enough people knew where to go or people had heard about it or at least enough

27:54.920 --> 28:00.480
word-of-mouth spread happened that oh you switch to Linux oh you should go try out XYZ

28:00.480 --> 28:04.160
go look at their site because they got a ton of great info and I feel like that would do

28:04.160 --> 28:10.120
it like almost like how the Linux foundation is focused on the core agendas of Linux and

28:10.120 --> 28:14.080
financing the core development of Linux and and representing Linux it'd be amazing if

28:14.080 --> 28:20.640
there was another foundation that was focused on maybe new user switchers because I feel

28:20.640 --> 28:26.480
like we're entering 2014 with with Steam OS which is our which is our next topic and I

28:26.480 --> 28:29.600
don't know about you guys but there are there are a surprising I don't know if you've seen

28:29.600 --> 28:33.960
the post there's a surprising amount of Windows users who are switching but they're like hey

28:33.960 --> 28:37.600
I'm gonna try out switching to Steam OS today like they say they're gonna switch to Steam

28:37.600 --> 28:42.960
OS it's crazy but we're gonna have more people coming to Linux than ever before because Windows

28:42.960 --> 28:47.280
is continually being cocked up with X next version now they're gonna supposedly with

28:47.280 --> 28:50.760
threshold they're gonna add the start menu back which is gonna be a total cluster because

28:50.760 --> 28:54.560
they're still gonna have these weird mixed desktop metaphors going on it's totally gonna

28:54.560 --> 28:58.760
flop in the enterprise the enterprise is gonna be looking for something to move over to gamers

28:58.760 --> 29:03.280
are looking for something to move over to the economy sucking super bad nobody has money

29:03.280 --> 29:06.400
they're trying to get more investments out of the existing machines they already have

29:06.400 --> 29:10.200
so they're switching over to Linux the amount of people moving into Linux it's like there's

29:10.200 --> 29:14.360
just not the support infrastructure required to make it all work smoothly for these people

29:14.360 --> 29:20.200
I'd love to see something like that set up I think it would be great if all the distros

29:20.200 --> 29:24.800
put when you download the installer that you have if you need help click here and then

29:24.800 --> 29:34.160
it's we go to the side with Linux help there there are started that like the mint has done

29:34.160 --> 29:42.400
it for a while like on when Jaro does that I think it taggers does it too now you need

29:42.400 --> 29:46.560
help go here if you need I mean there's there's there's help islands right there's askabuntu

29:46.560 --> 29:50.620
there's the arch wiki there's the Gentoo wiki there's the fedora forms there's the open

29:50.620 --> 29:56.600
susa community all meant everybody every distro really has their own islands but I feel like

29:56.600 --> 30:03.800
that's first of all like a Linux questions org 2.0 right let's consolidate the effort

30:03.800 --> 30:08.320
right let's consolidate the effort one spot one and the reason I use the word brand is

30:08.320 --> 30:13.200
because I don't like it but that's what resonates with just average users oh this is this is

30:13.200 --> 30:17.520
something I know I can trust it's it's a it's a helpful thing and and we can all go there

30:17.520 --> 30:23.560
because I honestly think it's like if somebody downloads integros or kudora right do you

30:23.560 --> 30:27.800
really expect them to figure out like that they should be going back to this other distros

30:27.800 --> 30:30.960
forums which are gonna be more active than the sub distros forms because they're just

30:30.960 --> 30:35.680
a spin of the other distro that's ridiculous it's not gonna happen but if I were never

30:35.680 --> 30:42.360
told the original distro you're on a spin of that distro on them on help outs there's

30:42.360 --> 30:48.120
if you just search for the word Linux there's eight pages or so oh really people offering

30:48.120 --> 30:52.380
help yeah there's this quite a given that it's like limited rollout and that's exactly

30:52.380 --> 30:56.680
the kind of thing you know you can monetize it at a per hour or per minute basis or you

30:56.680 --> 31:02.960
can make it free or you can do a mix of the both and you know you you can basically achieve

31:02.960 --> 31:08.320
what what you're hoping for but as an individual I just wish I wish Google was as owning this

31:08.320 --> 31:13.100
you know I wish I wish this was something that was more from the open source community

31:13.100 --> 31:19.120
itself because you know you need a web RTC based right exactly exactly you need a web

31:19.120 --> 31:23.800
RTC based system with Bitcoin paid in or litecoin or whatever you want as the payment system

31:23.800 --> 31:29.680
so that way it's directly from the from the user directly to the producer and it's not

31:29.680 --> 31:32.640
going through Google they're not taking their cut you don't have to have a wallet account

31:32.640 --> 31:35.720
you don't have to have a tied to your bank account and Google can't just arbitrarily

31:35.720 --> 31:43.440
shut you down I have spent I have submitted just this morning just just before 930 today

31:43.440 --> 31:49.320
I submitted 30 disputes to YouTube takedowns of Jupiter broadcasting videos and that's

31:49.320 --> 31:53.280
not all of them I cut it off because I had a conference call I had to jump on and that

31:53.280 --> 31:58.000
was at 30 before 930 today I don't want to give Google any of this stuff because they're

31:58.000 --> 32:01.360
just gonna cock it up they're just screwing it all up and so I would love to see something

32:01.360 --> 32:07.520
that's community focused this might be a this might be a good way to like test the theory

32:07.520 --> 32:11.560
is there a demand for this type of service what do you think I don't know wasn't that

32:11.560 --> 32:16.320
the whole point yeah there is no point of a red hat though was it bright enterprise

32:16.320 --> 32:19.800
level for business yeah for businesses Matt what do you Matt what do you think about the

32:19.800 --> 32:24.320
concept of is could help outs like prove the concept and then the community take it from

32:24.320 --> 32:29.440
there well so here's the problem I actually have a help out set up it's awesome one little

32:29.440 --> 32:33.360
tidbit though because I was stupid enough to use Google for my merchant account at one

32:33.360 --> 32:38.880
time years ago I can't use Google wallets with that particular invited address so I'm

32:38.880 --> 32:43.320
still in I'm still in purgatory trying to get that set up and here I am trying to offer

32:43.320 --> 32:47.640
that and I think it testifies to what you're saying as far as using Google for the service

32:47.640 --> 32:55.000
don't run away run far away don't use good I've between you know their random SEO nuclear

32:55.000 --> 32:58.560
bomb set offs and all this other stuff I think there's just too much power play there there's

32:58.560 --> 33:03.840
way too much power I'm watching you know a lot of things they're doing scare me I think

33:03.840 --> 33:10.180
there's very much so yeah I don't think so I was I was boiling over with anger because

33:10.180 --> 33:14.520
what's happening is is and let you know what I got an idea let's just let's get ourselves

33:14.520 --> 33:19.260
in trouble I'm just gonna play a little music right now because what happens every time

33:19.260 --> 33:26.920
I play a Ronald Jenke song who not only have I gotten a license from for all of his music

33:26.920 --> 33:32.360
he's also somebody I consider a friend I have emails from him right now saying hey I'm really

33:32.360 --> 33:36.800
sorry about this I want you to use my music you've sold a ton of CDs for me it's been

33:36.800 --> 33:42.980
an amazing relationship like you are you are helping me and I want you to use my music

33:42.980 --> 33:47.760
and now YouTube is tagging every single Jupiter broadcasting video that has Ronald Jenke's

33:47.760 --> 33:52.120
music and well guess what that's just about every damn show on the network yep so it's

33:52.120 --> 33:55.800
it whenever you hand it over to them if they have the payment aspect if they have the content

33:55.800 --> 33:59.840
distribution aspect whatever if they have and also by the way that relationship is being

33:59.840 --> 34:04.320
established that account is being created and established with Google not with you directly

34:04.320 --> 34:08.520
so if they shut down your account that person would have to go find you on your own website

34:08.520 --> 34:11.780
created a new account set up a new payment system and all of that and you know what they're

34:11.780 --> 34:16.240
not gonna do it there's gonna find the next guy doing the help outs on Google yep exactly

34:16.240 --> 34:22.600
so anyways that's my rant Chris if I can just jump back to your one brand idea I don't think

34:22.600 --> 34:27.160
that works because what works on Ubuntu doesn't work on Arch well no you'd have to have different

34:27.160 --> 34:30.340
you yeah you'd have to accommodate for that for sure you'd have to have people that could

34:30.340 --> 34:33.760
totally different audiences too you have to be like you'd have to have channels to send

34:33.760 --> 34:36.920
people down the right channel and then you'd have people that you know you have representatives

34:36.920 --> 34:41.320
from the Arch community representatives from the Ubuntu community and maybe even eventually

34:41.320 --> 34:45.640
like that person would push that person onto a thread on ask Ubuntu like it doesn't necessarily

34:45.640 --> 34:50.080
negate the need for distro specific help resources but it might help people get people in the

34:50.080 --> 34:54.580
right direction right but it sounds like you're just advocating also stronger bit branding

34:54.580 --> 34:59.560
for the distro in question so you might instead of saying you're using Linux say you're using

34:59.560 --> 35:03.640
Ubuntu that'll make it so much easier for your average user to find help instead of

35:03.640 --> 35:07.440
putting you know how do I set this up and adding Linux so they can get rid of all the

35:07.440 --> 35:11.800
windows you know what great point you bun too and exactly distro specific help yeah

35:11.800 --> 35:19.220
you know because when I had my wife try out mint she she was searching for Linux application

35:19.220 --> 35:24.320
thing she wasn't searching for how do I install X on mint Linux or how do I install X on Ubuntu

35:24.320 --> 35:28.560
Linux how do I install it on Linux and and she didn't know that she's going to get a

35:28.560 --> 35:33.560
dramatically different answer by searching for how do I install shot well on Ubuntu then

35:33.560 --> 35:38.840
how do I install shot well on Linux that concept never she never even realizes she needed to

35:38.840 --> 35:45.280
make that that that clarification but then you get but with that you fragment the Linux

35:45.280 --> 35:51.600
help if you put to one page the the page can read which additional you can use or you can

35:51.600 --> 35:56.920
just choose it you just get help for that additional specific yeah and you could when

35:56.920 --> 36:01.800
you're searching for like when you're searching for software or whatever then you have to

36:01.800 --> 36:05.760
teach them to say well when you're looking for software then you search for Linux and

36:05.760 --> 36:10.640
when you need help you search for Linux mint or whatever because now now picture this in

36:10.640 --> 36:15.040
a commercial you too can try this great Linux distro just learn to use Google learn to use

36:15.040 --> 36:18.480
this other tool then stand on one foot twirl around in a circle stand on your head too

36:18.480 --> 36:22.340
much I mean it's no one no one care I mean it's like that's that's why we fall off that's

36:22.340 --> 36:29.240
totally why we fall off yeah so and I remember this old article I think was ZDNet had it

36:29.240 --> 36:36.880
and it was this guy complaining about Linux I remember he tried to install the RPM like

36:36.880 --> 36:43.240
he tried to install on Debian you're gonna have a bad time yeah it's not gonna work and

36:43.240 --> 36:49.080
he was like trying to mix like all three package managers at once and wondering why because

36:49.080 --> 36:54.640
he searched for how to do this on Linux and he got the answer for like CentOS and then

36:54.640 --> 37:00.880
tried to do it on his Ubuntu machine and man yeah that happens too I mean that's the problem

37:00.880 --> 37:05.880
I mean you could you could do the way that if you wanted to do something cross cross

37:05.880 --> 37:11.160
distro you could do it in the way that help us do it and just tag people you know people

37:11.160 --> 37:16.300
say you know my expert area is servers and you know I deal with hard disk related problems

37:16.300 --> 37:24.520
and like a reputation system like you know user Matt is good at Ubuntu support and he

37:24.520 --> 37:29.480
has 25 upvotes in the Ubuntu support category that kind of thing yeah that'll work yeah

37:29.480 --> 37:47.640
software has a bunch of things like that right yeah most most people if their Linux computer

37:47.640 --> 37:52.960
is broken they're switching from a second computer yeah and also if they whether they

37:52.960 --> 38:07.640
do know it or not for example Linux Mint it still shows up as a bunch of questions like

38:07.640 --> 38:14.080
questions about unity itself or XFCE or KDE because they're like I mean KDE is gonna be

38:14.080 --> 38:21.020
completely different on how to do something in XFCE would yeah very true right yeah and

38:21.020 --> 38:25.880
you can just tag yourself with whatever desktops you're familiar with and when someone searches

38:25.880 --> 38:30.680
you know what do you want help with filter it with this then yeah I think this is this

38:30.680 --> 38:36.360
is also why I like the idea of like a video type based hangout because the user might

38:36.360 --> 38:40.660
not know what quite the right things are but if they can generally get into the direction

38:40.660 --> 38:45.640
of talking to another human being that person would go oh oh you're on KDE oh okay I thought

38:45.640 --> 38:49.560
you were on gnome no what you need to do is go to system settings and then you need to

38:49.560 --> 38:56.560
go to appearance right so I think that's why that that interactive aspect of it is is almost

38:56.560 --> 39:00.920
worth that money because they can they can kind of fill that gap where the user doesn't

39:00.920 --> 39:06.360
quite even know what to ask for totally yeah the more the more I hear like what we're talking

39:06.360 --> 39:11.480
about here the more I kind of see it has to be a company that's doing this because it's

39:11.480 --> 39:15.400
almost sounds like you have to have like I got almost like a conveyor belt system where

39:15.400 --> 39:20.240
you have someone that just diagnoses the problem like oh you're using KDE we're sending you

39:20.240 --> 39:26.440
to our KDE guy you know it's got to be an incentive otherwise no one cares my here's

39:26.440 --> 39:30.520
the simplest fix I can think of for just like even existing systems is first of all for

39:30.520 --> 39:36.240
the love of Pete incentivize incentivize this somehow right swag right hats t-shirts a handshake

39:36.240 --> 39:40.040
meet meet someone famous what I don't care you know whatever it is incentivize it somewhere

39:40.040 --> 39:43.320
more importantly every time an update for that particular just rolls out there should

39:43.320 --> 39:47.760
be a list of people that are alerted via email saying hey this has been updated you have

39:47.760 --> 39:52.160
an opportunity to earn more swag would you like to update this wiki or what about many

39:52.160 --> 39:59.080
probably tie that in the help out system like yeah so maybe when when you know Ubuntu 1404

39:59.080 --> 40:04.400
ships wouldn't it be interesting if by the way Ubuntu 1404 is shipped go to this URL

40:04.400 --> 40:09.320
to find out all the people on Google help outs that are helping people transition from

40:09.320 --> 40:13.880
1310 to 1404 or whatever right like when some big announce you could tie it to anything

40:13.880 --> 40:17.480
when some big release of something comes out here's the people on Google help outs that

40:17.480 --> 40:21.280
are already totally up to date on this topic and ready to help you make the switch and

40:21.280 --> 40:25.400
I think that you could that could be a really big opportunity too I mean I'm now I'm coming

40:25.400 --> 40:28.600
back on the side of Google help outs again just because I don't feel like there's a better

40:28.600 --> 40:33.200
option yet but I'd love to see some more good the stack exchange system has a lot of this

40:33.200 --> 40:37.760
already kind of built in and the like they incentivize it with just badges but you could

40:37.760 --> 40:44.960
yeah yeah that by you know if canonical donates a thousand t-shirts then the first thousand

40:44.960 --> 40:51.360
people to get a thousand rep points can get a free t-shirt yeah and titles titles meaningless

40:51.360 --> 40:57.960
titles people love titles I guess the achievement teacher because when I answer a question I

40:57.960 --> 41:02.360
don't just answer the question I also explain why it is that way right yeah that would be

41:02.360 --> 41:08.040
awesome I like the badge right or you get like you know analytical because of the way

41:08.040 --> 41:11.120
that would work that would work that would totally work yeah kind of a gamification of

41:11.120 --> 41:18.560
support a little bit and all of that yeah yeah market just throw a few space bucks into

41:18.560 --> 41:22.560
that right I hear that's how that works well you know you become like the super grant granular

41:22.560 --> 41:26.800
spaceman wizard guy or whatever like the best of the best the ninja whatever then you get

41:26.800 --> 41:31.080
to meet mark in person or something you know whatever it may be you know something cool

41:31.080 --> 41:36.440
you know what I have most of my points are in answering nginx questions on server fall

41:36.440 --> 41:43.540
when I met mark in person it was at an Ubuntu conference and he was working with he was

41:43.540 --> 41:49.440
talking to a guy from Intel and they had this tiny micro PC this was this is before the

41:49.440 --> 41:55.800
iPad this was this is a long time ago and mark was playing with this little this little

41:55.800 --> 42:01.040
Intel based PC running Ubuntu that was I've never seen a computer this small it was a

42:01.040 --> 42:06.200
full-fledged like microcomputer with a with a with a bigger QWERTY keyboard I think if

42:06.200 --> 42:12.640
I recall poppy you know what I'm talking about was an Intel classmate maybe I maybe was when

42:12.640 --> 42:16.320
the classmate was born right that might have been when it was that it was it was really

42:16.320 --> 42:23.040
cool round around mouse touchpad yeah I can't remember if I had a touchpad or not but I

42:23.040 --> 42:29.140
mean it's funny now looking at the whole the whole Ubuntu touch effort and now how captivated

42:29.140 --> 42:33.840
mark was by this device back then and you can kind of it's you see the history connect

42:33.840 --> 42:38.320
um all right well so I do want to actually touch on the topic of steam OS a little bit

42:38.320 --> 42:42.640
because we've got a great resource in the mumble room today and he's the creator of

42:42.640 --> 42:47.840
simple screen recorder and he's been working on how he's actually the guy I found out that

42:47.840 --> 42:53.200
that the gnome desktop session is running in a separate X session than the actual steam

42:53.200 --> 42:57.960
big picture interfaces by his commentary in our Linux action show subreddit so I want

42:57.960 --> 43:01.880
to talk to him a little bit about his efforts on setting up and configuring and building

43:01.880 --> 43:05.600
simple screen recorder to record a steam OS but before we get to that I want to think

43:05.600 --> 43:10.460
digital ocean simple cloud hosting digital ocean is dedicated offering the most intuitive

43:10.460 --> 43:17.200
way to spin up a cloud server it I gotta tell you I set up a I set up a clouds a droplet

43:17.200 --> 43:22.080
as they call it called Europa because Europa is a moon of Jupiter yeah I know I'm funny

43:22.080 --> 43:26.640
like that and you know what they say users can create a cloud server in 55 seconds I

43:26.640 --> 43:30.760
don't want to brag I created mine in 45 seconds pricing plans start only five dollars per

43:30.760 --> 43:36.780
month for 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD yes an SSD and yes it makes a difference

43:36.780 --> 43:42.140
one CPU and a terabyte of transfer right there for five dollars a terabyte of transfer right

43:42.140 --> 43:45.880
there in the plan digital ocean has data center locations in New York San Francisco

43:45.880 --> 43:50.740
and Amsterdam actually they got two in New York Sun I got my droplet in New York number

43:50.740 --> 43:55.360
two which has been fantastic because then I get something I have I have facilities here

43:55.360 --> 43:59.780
on the West Coast Adam on my own fiber connection and I have facilities on the East Coast which

43:59.780 --> 44:04.200
is awesome for the kind of distribution I'm doing by the way the interface on digital

44:04.200 --> 44:08.480
ocean is super simple intuitive the control panel is powerful and they also have a very

44:08.480 --> 44:12.600
straightforward API if you just want to write something that talks to it digital open digital

so go over to digital ocean.com and a big thank you to digital ocean for sponsoring

45:04.820 --> 45:11.200
Linux unplugged I love my digital ocean droplet Matt loves it good stuff love it I want to

45:11.200 --> 45:15.340
bring in Martin here so Martin you've been working on simple screen recorder and you've

45:15.340 --> 45:18.220
been playing around with SteamOS a little bit tell me a little bit about what you found

45:18.220 --> 45:28.960
so far okay SteamOS is actually just a Debian distribution but Valve made some changes so

45:28.960 --> 45:35.160
they don't use the Debian repositories Valve has their own repositories which is actually

45:35.160 --> 45:40.340
just a really stripped down version of Debian so they don't have any packages that they

45:40.340 --> 45:44.680
don't need I think if you look at the packages that are actually installed it's like all

45:44.680 --> 45:51.260
of them so that's a bit of a problem if you want to yeah load other open source applications

45:51.260 --> 45:56.860
well were you able to add just a regular Debian repost to the sources.list file yeah you can

45:56.860 --> 46:04.220
but there are some conflicts I think I did it it just well it will pull in some applications

46:04.220 --> 46:09.780
that no not application but things like grub that were updated okay it didn't break for

46:09.780 --> 46:15.500
me but I'm not sure so I don't really recommend that okay okay so what kind of success did

46:15.500 --> 46:21.320
you see with running simple screen recorder on SteamOS yeah so right now it doesn't really

46:21.320 --> 46:28.160
work yet because the Valve has split the desktop and Steam itself so they're actually two separate

46:28.160 --> 46:33.100
accounts and when you switch between them it's like switching to a different user account

46:33.100 --> 46:38.660
on the normal Linux desktop so if you try to run an application on the desktop like

46:38.660 --> 46:42.580
simple screen recorder and you try to record it and then you switch back well you won't

46:42.580 --> 46:50.660
see anything and it also breaks things like keyboard shortcuts so yeah a lot of things

46:50.660 --> 46:55.140
I still have to work around and you can't so you can't share the same home folder so

46:55.140 --> 46:59.380
if you record something on one desktop now have you been able to record the SteamOS session

46:59.380 --> 47:05.900
well I can record the desktop but I haven't really tried yet well one other problem is

47:05.900 --> 47:11.420
I'm doing all this in a virtual machine right now okay and I didn't get hardware acceleration

47:11.420 --> 47:17.140
to work so it's yeah really really slow yeah so it's a bit hard to test it now I guess

47:17.140 --> 47:20.300
it kind of makes sense that they'd break that off into its own user account and and all

47:20.300 --> 47:25.060
of that well I mean I'm sure you'll work on it over time I think it's something that people

47:25.060 --> 47:29.260
want to do quite a bit because you know I mean that's your simple simple screen recorder

47:29.260 --> 47:33.180
is an awesome utility so yes it is keep us posted in the Linux action show subreddit

47:33.180 --> 47:39.700
would you okay all right very good all right guys well so we have one bit of email I want

47:39.700 --> 47:45.380
to get to before we wrap up for the day today and it's actually on the topic of lugs as

47:45.380 --> 47:51.200
well it wasn't exactly a explicit follow-up to our episode last week but I'll read it

47:51.200 --> 47:53.960
Matt maybe you and I will kick some thoughts around then I'll bring in the mumble room

47:53.960 --> 47:57.460
to get their final thoughts on it but comes in from Archie and he wants to talk about

47:57.460 --> 48:00.420
starting the luck now I know we had somebody in the mumble room last week who was interested

48:00.420 --> 48:02.860
in that I don't know if we still do but we'll jump in there in a second says hey Chris and

48:02.860 --> 48:07.500
Matt but a longtime viewer of last however this is my first time submitting a question

48:07.500 --> 48:11.060
to any of the shows during the last episode of Linux Unplugged you touched on the topic

48:11.060 --> 48:17.300
of lugs I'm living Estonia and as far as I know there's no existing lug in our country

48:17.300 --> 48:22.220
moreover I could not find any active lugs in either Lativa or let's do Lithuania let's

48:22.220 --> 48:26.740
let it oh geez oh man let's do it I used to know how to pronounce it but I can't lethonia

48:26.740 --> 48:32.700
I'm gonna go with Lithuania which is our oh my yes that's right so I was thinking about

48:32.700 --> 48:37.340
starting one in my country however I'm struggling to find a direction in which to go I mean

48:37.340 --> 48:41.740
I could personally give a couple of short talks but that's basically it I have some

48:41.740 --> 48:46.700
friends who are very passionate about Linux but I really believe organizing an install

48:46.700 --> 48:51.020
fest is kind of dull as you mentioned in the show lugs are all about meeting people in

48:51.020 --> 48:55.580
real life but what could be the reason that would convince people to physically come to

48:55.580 --> 49:00.020
one place and discuss stuff from what I understand there are some people in the audience who

49:00.020 --> 49:03.780
have some experience with participating in a lug so maybe they could give some suggestions

49:03.780 --> 49:08.220
keep up the great work Archie so he talked on it so I thought first of all Archie has

49:08.220 --> 49:12.660
a good insight so I think one of the things he was talking about here was holding talks

49:12.660 --> 49:16.560
to bring people to the meetup and you know I think that's a really good idea if there's

49:16.560 --> 49:21.260
a topic on Linux or if there's several topics on Linux that Archie you're comfortable with

49:21.260 --> 49:25.220
and you could volunteer to hold talks to bring people in people will come and if they have

49:25.220 --> 49:30.380
you will find that the people that come to watch your talk likely have topics and subjects

49:30.380 --> 49:36.300
they are qualified to have talks yes and you can work with them I was wondering like so

49:36.300 --> 49:42.020
you know Matt getting things started I like the idea of I mean I can't believe I'm about

49:42.020 --> 49:45.860
to say this but using a resource like Facebook and finding people in your local area who

49:45.860 --> 49:50.880
share a common interest with you and maybe establishing like a group on Google Plus or

49:50.880 --> 49:55.880
a group on Facebook or whatever it is where you guys virtually kind of collaborate initially

49:55.880 --> 50:01.900
and then once you kind of have a core group maybe move to doing something local I would

50:01.900 --> 50:07.140
actually do that but I will also integrate the talks ideas you pointed out also pointing

50:07.140 --> 50:11.460
out that in Estonia and a lot of other countries there are social networks that are perhaps

50:11.460 --> 50:15.260
more popular there than they are here and I forget I can't think of their names off

50:15.260 --> 50:19.460
top my head but Facebook like networks for sure but I think the talks idea is good I

50:19.460 --> 50:23.540
think that also offering for people that have never even heard of Linux if you want to get

50:23.540 --> 50:27.800
fresh fresh blood into it actually saying hey do you have an old XP machine that you're

50:27.800 --> 50:30.820
just discovered it's going to become a paperweight here very quickly right let's have a look

50:30.820 --> 50:34.220
at that maybe not necessarily an install fest but let's actually look at your options look

50:34.220 --> 50:37.660
at the look at the headlines take advantage of that hey did you hear XP a supports ending

50:37.660 --> 50:41.860
well come to our group and we'll show you how to get more value out of that old PC and

50:41.860 --> 50:46.580
then you winking a little glitter on the tooth all right well let's her I'll bring the bring

50:46.580 --> 50:50.380
the mobile guys back in so anybody in the room have experience with starting the log

50:50.380 --> 50:54.060
or have ideas for Archie on how we can get started with creating a local log maybe the

50:54.060 --> 51:02.580
first log in his country sorry I was just going to say you were saying about incorporating

51:02.580 --> 51:08.860
things like Facebook Google Plus etc social networks you might you might actually run

51:08.860 --> 51:12.460
into some problems there because at least I've found that a lot of the people that are

51:12.460 --> 51:16.860
really into Linux and would love to go to logs are the people that don't really use

51:16.860 --> 51:22.460
them that much oh different audiences mm-hmm I'm not so sure I think there's certainly

51:22.460 --> 51:29.500
a crossover of refuse nicks who hate social media and scoff at that kind of stuff and

51:29.500 --> 51:36.340
the privacy issues I need the people who know better right right yeah the Venn diagram

51:36.340 --> 51:41.860
has a massive overlap between them and people who go to Linux user groups but we my local

51:41.860 --> 51:46.260
Linux user group on the subject of talks they do exactly that they put a mail out on the

51:46.260 --> 51:50.580
mailing list and say because we have we have a mailing list and an IRC channel we have

51:50.580 --> 51:56.300
a Google Plus page a Twitter account and I don't think we have a Facebook page but that's

51:56.300 --> 52:00.980
just because I haven't been done yet but the we put a mail out and say look we're having

52:00.980 --> 52:05.740
a meeting at this time on this day if anyone wants to give a talk let me know and then

52:05.740 --> 52:11.060
they build up on the web page and on the day we set some times when the talks are going

52:11.060 --> 52:13.860
to be given and the rest of the time it's just general chitchat and support and that

52:13.860 --> 52:19.140
kind of stuff and that works out really well I've listened to some really diverse topics

52:19.140 --> 52:24.740
like three completely different things that you you wouldn't put in a track on a conference

52:24.740 --> 52:28.540
together right you know completely wildly different things but all interesting and all

52:28.540 --> 52:32.980
you know or not necessarily all interesting sometimes some of them are just you know not

52:32.980 --> 52:36.700
interesting to me but interesting to half the rest of the audience but then the rest

52:36.700 --> 52:40.740
of the time you can sit there and you know fix someone's PC or something I think a mailing

52:40.740 --> 52:44.460
list is a really key point because you could have people subscribe to the mailing list

52:44.460 --> 52:47.580
you could say hey are you interested in Linux do you live in this area subscribe to our

52:47.580 --> 52:51.180
mailing list you wait till that mailing list is built up to a substantial subscriber base

52:51.180 --> 52:55.660
and then that's when you start to pull the gun or pull the trigger on on the local stuff

52:55.660 --> 53:02.260
you know maybe you don't start with local maybe you start with a mailing list we have

53:02.260 --> 53:12.340
I'm from Estonia and we have a webpage called bingveen.org and that kind of has all the

53:12.340 --> 53:21.380
information about Estonian Linux users and those things what was it again it was in the

53:21.380 --> 53:30.060
chat room earlier bingveen.org okay yeah I'll put a link to it in the show notes p-i-n-g-v-i-n.org

53:30.060 --> 53:38.060
very good and we have once a year we have it in September we have free software day

53:38.060 --> 53:47.340
that all the free software activists come together and have a meeting or two cool things

53:47.340 --> 53:53.900
and stuff very good well thank you I'll link to that so maybe our writer will catch that

53:53.900 --> 53:58.220
in the show notes yeah definitely good stuff thank you all right guys well so just a couple

53:58.220 --> 54:01.900
of extra things in the show notes I want to point people over to Thermonex wrote in and

54:01.900 --> 54:05.860
he built a steam box on arch and he has some scripts for that we have a link to that in

54:05.860 --> 54:09.980
the show notes he says I recently set up arch linux on my home theater pc and I set it to

54:09.980 --> 54:14.940
boot into xbox media center the standalone edition from xbmc now I have a shortcut to

54:14.940 --> 54:19.380
launch steam of course I could easily boot directly into steam os but it's his script

54:19.380 --> 54:23.340
so he has an entry now in his xbmc menu Matt how awesome is this right I'm gonna you know

54:23.340 --> 54:27.200
I actually like that better than steam os just because it's less clicks less hassle

54:27.200 --> 54:31.020
it's more functional right you can watch your videos and so then he's in xbmc and he clicks

54:31.020 --> 54:34.740
it and then it starts steam in big picture mode and he's got I'll have a link to that

54:34.740 --> 54:42.100
and also of course Michael Laerbeil over at Ferronix just got in some benchmarks of steam

54:42.100 --> 54:54.460
os versus dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun windows 8.1 on the video chip and guess what the performance

54:54.460 --> 54:58.780
is pretty much as long as you have everything set along along the same lines it seems like

54:58.780 --> 55:02.820
it's pretty much neck and neck there's nothing really too outrageously different there but

55:02.820 --> 55:06.860
we'll have a link to that if you guys want to read that in the show notes as well alright

55:06.860 --> 55:10.860
well look we're gonna wrap up right here but we want to hear from you so you can join us

55:10.860 --> 55:15.660
live on a Tuesday Matt and I sit down we open up the mumble room and we begin our conference

55:15.660 --> 55:20.200
with our internet lug and we do that over at jblive.tv on a Tuesday and you can find

55:20.200 --> 55:24.980
out when that's at by going over to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar send us in your feedback on

55:24.980 --> 55:28.620
any topic we covered or topics you'd like it to hear us cover you know I don't know

55:28.620 --> 55:31.540
maybe you got something we haven't thought of go over to jupiterbroadcasting.com and

55:31.540 --> 55:36.620
pop that contact link and we'd love to hear from you alright Matt well guess what we're

55:36.620 --> 55:40.900
gonna do a review of fedora 20 on the big show on Sunday oh yeah so I'll see you then

55:40.900 --> 55:45.220
okay cool see you then alright everyone well thank you so much for tuning this week's episode

55:45.220 --> 55:51.300
of Linux Unplugged we'll see you right back here next week.
