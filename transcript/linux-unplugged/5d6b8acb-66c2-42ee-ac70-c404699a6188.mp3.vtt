WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.500
I was trying to come up with an excuse for doing this episode, like I was going to blame

00:03.500 --> 00:07.660
it on, like, oh, it's summer solstice time, and then we kind of missed that.

00:07.660 --> 00:11.060
And then I was just kind of trying to come up with ideas, like, what's the hook for doing

00:11.060 --> 00:12.060
this episode?

00:12.060 --> 00:15.220
And then I realized we just kind of want to.

00:15.220 --> 00:18.660
I think the hook is you need a vacation, son.

00:18.660 --> 00:19.660
Oh, yeah, that's true.

00:19.660 --> 00:22.100
I will be in Montana when this episode rolls out.

00:22.100 --> 00:24.200
But it's with three kids in an RV.

00:24.200 --> 00:25.200
Is that really a vacation?

00:25.200 --> 00:27.860
Have you ever seen any of the RV family trip movies?

00:27.860 --> 00:37.240
They're pretty close to reality.

00:37.240 --> 00:40.440
Welcome to Linux Unplugged episode 310.

00:40.440 --> 00:41.440
My name is Chris.

00:41.440 --> 00:42.440
My name is Wes.

00:42.440 --> 00:43.440
Hi there, Wes.

00:43.440 --> 00:44.440
Nice to see you again.

00:44.440 --> 00:45.440
Hello.

00:45.440 --> 00:46.440
Hello, cheese.

00:46.440 --> 00:47.440
Hey, how's it going?

00:47.440 --> 00:48.440
Hey, buddy.

00:48.440 --> 00:49.440
And hello, Elle.

00:49.440 --> 00:50.440
Hey, hey.

00:50.440 --> 00:51.440
Hello, hello.

00:51.440 --> 00:52.440
Good to have you here.

00:52.440 --> 00:54.560
Well, this is another one of these specials that we've been doing recently.

00:54.560 --> 00:57.920
We thought we'd look back at this point in the year at some of the stories that I would

00:57.920 --> 01:01.500
say surprised us, the ones that really stood out.

01:01.500 --> 01:05.000
And then we've brought a collection of our own personal, let's call them favorite stories

01:05.000 --> 01:06.220
of the year.

01:06.220 --> 01:10.760
And we'll tell you what those are and then tell you where we think they're going.

01:10.760 --> 01:12.240
It's a fun special edition.

01:12.240 --> 01:16.000
And we had sort of the perfect opportunity right here in the middle of the year.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.780
Often, summer is a hit and miss Newsweek.

01:19.780 --> 01:22.320
It's been actually a pretty crazy, busy summer.

01:22.320 --> 01:23.720
Actually, it really has, yeah.

01:23.720 --> 01:26.360
And there's a couple of things that have already sort of stood out.

01:26.360 --> 01:29.180
And so our crack research team put a few of these together.

01:29.180 --> 01:32.040
So we'll go through theirs and then we'll go through ours.

01:32.040 --> 01:33.520
And then we'll see where we end up.

01:33.520 --> 01:38.120
Honestly, I'm glad we're doing this because as has quickly been revealed, a lot has happened

01:38.120 --> 01:39.120
this year.

01:39.120 --> 01:41.600
And it's interesting to see which trends are continuing.

01:41.600 --> 01:45.340
On a personal note, we were looking at some of our data.

01:45.340 --> 01:46.340
And it's interesting.

01:46.340 --> 01:49.240
You can watch my journey in the data for our show.

01:49.240 --> 01:55.520
So towards the end of last year, we were talking a lot about Plasma.

01:55.520 --> 01:59.280
And then towards the beginning of this year and through this year, which we'll talk about

01:59.280 --> 02:01.920
more later, we started talking more about Gnome.

02:01.920 --> 02:06.320
And now here I am sitting here and I'm using Fedora.

02:06.320 --> 02:09.800
So it's been, personally, a really interesting transition of a year for me going from all

02:09.800 --> 02:11.840
these different desktops to a completely different distribution.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.080
Fedora with XFCE, of all things.

02:14.080 --> 02:15.080
Yeah.

02:15.080 --> 02:21.360
I always kind of wanted up-to-date user land applications like Firefox and Chrome and Guake

02:21.360 --> 02:25.400
and up-to-date drivers because I tend to want to do a little bit of gaming.

02:25.400 --> 02:29.000
But there's certain aspects of my desktop I don't need to change very often.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.320
And I think that's what happened for me this year is I sort of, I found the sweet spot

02:32.320 --> 02:38.860
in something that is updated a fairly regular clip but also allows for me to have some staticness

02:38.860 --> 02:39.860
where I need it.

02:39.860 --> 02:42.200
That was an interesting journey for me.

02:42.200 --> 02:45.280
I mean, really, a couple of years ago when I switched to Arch and just stayed there for

02:45.280 --> 02:46.280
a while.

02:46.280 --> 02:47.840
And then once I left Arch, I had this meandering.

02:47.840 --> 02:49.480
You haven't settled down.

02:49.480 --> 02:51.200
This is feeling like maybe you'll stick, though.

02:51.200 --> 02:52.200
Feeling good.

02:52.200 --> 02:53.200
All right.

02:53.200 --> 02:55.560
So here's something that has really stood out, I think a lot of you would agree with,

02:55.560 --> 03:00.920
in 2019 is this battle to block ads in these different takes.

03:00.920 --> 03:03.360
And Mozilla's really stood out here.

03:03.360 --> 03:07.720
Google hasn't come across looking great as there's been the debate about shutting down

03:07.720 --> 03:10.960
how many sites could be in this list that could be blocked.

03:10.960 --> 03:11.960
You know what I'm talking about.

03:11.960 --> 03:12.960
Ooh, yeah.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.000
And that's still up in the air as we record right now.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.600
But I would say definitely, I agree with the team, one of the standout stories, this whole

03:19.600 --> 03:21.960
battle for global ad blocking.

03:21.960 --> 03:25.800
Plus, you also have on iOS and Android built-in blockers now.

03:25.800 --> 03:29.280
And it's all really at the core of it about how people are gonna make money.

03:29.280 --> 03:30.280
Yeah, right.

03:30.280 --> 03:33.240
It's an important driver of economics all over the place.

03:33.240 --> 03:37.680
And as more people use devices, use mobile devices, ad blocking has gone from something

03:37.680 --> 03:41.840
that was kind of for the niche, for the nerds, for Linux-unplugged users, perhaps to something

03:41.840 --> 03:44.120
that everyone needs because ads are everywhere.

03:44.120 --> 03:50.200
Cheesy, what do you think about Mozilla announcing, let's say, I think it's around $5 a month.

03:50.200 --> 03:56.160
I don't know what the exact is after all fees and stuff, but $5 a month for ad-free news.

03:56.160 --> 04:02.320
When you look at how hard it is to find trusted news and you look at how ad blocking is really

04:02.320 --> 04:07.800
putting pressure on what is already a super tight market for monetization, maybe Mozilla

04:07.800 --> 04:09.880
has an actual strategy here?

04:09.880 --> 04:14.640
Well, I mean, I will say, first off, it kind of popped up out of the middle of nowhere

04:14.640 --> 04:15.920
it seemed like.

04:15.920 --> 04:17.760
I personally like the idea.

04:17.760 --> 04:20.060
I'm a news hound myself.

04:20.060 --> 04:27.000
And for anyone that's ever gone to any other news site, The Sun, you know, just anywhere

04:27.000 --> 04:32.440
and you see how inundated you are with ads, so just to have that clean news reading ability,

04:32.440 --> 04:34.120
I'm in on it.

04:34.120 --> 04:35.120
I do like that.

04:35.120 --> 04:36.120
I like that idea.

04:36.120 --> 04:42.200
But I'm curious how you feel, Elle, paying per month for access to news, which is out

04:42.200 --> 04:43.200
there for free.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.960
I mean, there's ways to get free news.

04:44.960 --> 04:46.400
How do you feel about it?

04:46.400 --> 04:47.400
There's bills to pay.

04:47.400 --> 04:48.400
There's water heaters to fix.

04:48.400 --> 04:49.960
Is $5 a month for news worth it?

04:49.960 --> 04:53.640
You know, I'm starting to wonder if they can just give me bulk pricing because they keep

04:53.640 --> 04:57.640
coming up with more things to kind of $5 a month me on.

04:57.640 --> 05:01.520
But then there are times that I'm trying to read a news article and I can't even get to

05:01.520 --> 05:06.400
the X on the screen because there's so many pop ups and I try to use ad blockers and it

05:06.400 --> 05:09.280
just won't give me the site and says, hey, we see you're using an ad blocker.

05:09.280 --> 05:11.880
If you want to see it, disable it.

05:11.880 --> 05:16.320
So at some point it's going to be picking, hey, do I use their ad blocking service or

05:16.320 --> 05:18.320
do I use their VPN?

05:18.320 --> 05:21.160
Because that $5 is going to add up quickly.

05:21.160 --> 05:22.160
That's a great point.

05:22.160 --> 05:26.680
I think Mozilla should offer some kind of bundle for like maybe it's $14.99 a month

05:26.680 --> 05:28.360
and it's everything they're about to roll out.

05:28.360 --> 05:29.840
The Firefox suite of services.

05:29.840 --> 05:32.080
Because you really get the sense they're just getting started too.

05:32.080 --> 05:33.080
Right.

05:33.080 --> 05:34.080
Absolutely.

05:34.080 --> 05:35.960
You got the news, you got the VPN, there's going to be other things that will roll into

05:35.960 --> 05:36.960
that.

05:36.960 --> 05:38.120
Honestly, a bundle would be pretty appetizing.

05:38.120 --> 05:39.120
I like the idea.

05:39.120 --> 05:41.560
I mean, I already fund some news organizations myself.

05:41.560 --> 05:45.600
I generally like what Mozilla is doing and I wouldn't mind giving Mozilla some cash also.

05:45.600 --> 05:46.600
Yeah.

05:46.600 --> 05:50.760
I wonder what the new sites revenue share is on that.

05:50.760 --> 05:54.080
I'd be keeping my eye out for that.

05:54.080 --> 05:55.280
How do they choose which partners?

05:55.280 --> 05:56.280
Yeah.

05:56.280 --> 06:01.120
I mean, with the Apple news, there's a rev share deal there where... I'm sure Mozilla

06:01.120 --> 06:02.120
is working that out.

06:02.120 --> 06:05.760
Maybe it's their partner that does it, but... There's that news story, which has been

06:05.760 --> 06:09.040
an interesting trend and it's obviously going to continue through the rest of 2019, no doubt

06:09.040 --> 06:10.040
about it.

06:10.040 --> 06:12.280
Then we had a couple of unexpected losses.

06:12.280 --> 06:17.400
Some friends that discontinued their projects in 2019 that I don't think we saw coming,

06:17.400 --> 06:21.080
number one, that I didn't see with scientific Linux.

06:21.080 --> 06:23.000
I think it makes sense.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.080
Maybe it's time.

06:25.080 --> 06:27.680
Now we know a little bit more, too, about what was involved in maintaining it and how

06:27.680 --> 06:28.680
much work it was.

06:28.680 --> 06:32.920
It seems pretty clear that if there's other means to do it, if they can do it through

06:32.920 --> 06:35.160
software modularity and containers and-

06:35.160 --> 06:36.160
Yeah.

06:36.160 --> 06:38.600
That's why this one kind of didn't surprise me.

06:38.600 --> 06:42.480
I think it was time and a lot of them... I think a lot of the surprise came from communities

06:42.480 --> 06:46.440
outside of scientific Linux, people that were... It was interesting to have.

06:46.440 --> 06:49.620
It made sense that a Linux distribution would be there to fit that niche.

06:49.620 --> 06:53.860
We all know there's a ton of Linux used in scientific work.

06:53.860 --> 06:56.560
It turns out most of that's just the tools, though, right?

06:56.560 --> 07:01.040
Having a specific distribution now that we have better tooling available to make these

07:01.040 --> 07:02.760
things, it's just too much work.

07:02.760 --> 07:03.760
Okay.

07:03.760 --> 07:04.760
What about Antegros?

07:04.760 --> 07:05.760
Okay.

07:05.760 --> 07:06.920
That one caught me off guard.

07:06.920 --> 07:14.460
I'm a Arch... Well, maybe not quite by the book, but doing it yourself kind of Arch user,

07:14.460 --> 07:19.080
but if I wanted a nice little GUI to have an Arch environment to install from or to

07:19.080 --> 07:23.560
push onto others, Antegros, that was my go-to.

07:23.560 --> 07:30.240
I think the best thing about Antegros was it was an easy way to show someone how freaking

07:30.240 --> 07:32.320
great Pac-Man and the AUR is.

07:32.320 --> 07:35.880
Right, because it's not like it was super customized, but it looked good out of the

07:35.880 --> 07:40.660
box and you had all the Arch goodness, so you didn't have to show them, oh, well, here's

07:40.660 --> 07:42.440
the console you'll be installing from.

07:42.440 --> 07:46.240
With the exception of four packages, it's mainline Arch, and...

07:46.240 --> 07:47.520
That was the other part, too, right?

07:47.520 --> 07:51.040
It works for when you're starting out, but it was also still easy to understand, still

07:51.040 --> 07:56.200
simple, stupid, and so you could use it as an advanced Arch user.

07:56.200 --> 08:00.100
Developing habits like following the Arch news and watching the Arch updates was worthwhile

08:00.100 --> 08:04.600
because it was the same thing you were going to get in Antegros, but the thing is, is getting

08:04.600 --> 08:07.680
someone that hands-on, and Manjaro does this, too, but getting someone that hands-on with

08:07.680 --> 08:14.080
Pac-Man and the AUR and things like that, that is such a great experience that it kind

08:14.080 --> 08:18.400
of makes it worth... It kind of makes it worth doing the whole thing.

08:18.400 --> 08:22.280
Later on, you'll be like, you know what, now that I know how great it is once it's all

08:22.280 --> 08:25.720
set up and how powerful it is and what all the flexibility and options are and the software

08:25.720 --> 08:29.880
availability, well, now it's worth going through the process of installing it.

08:29.880 --> 08:30.880
Yeah, right.

08:30.880 --> 08:34.360
You're excited, and you know there's a good end goal at the end.

08:34.360 --> 08:40.440
And let's not forget EndeavorOS, which is some of the original developers of Ant-er-grose,

08:40.440 --> 08:47.320
which, thankfully, we won't have to hear you butcher that again all of the time.

08:47.320 --> 08:53.880
But EndeavorOS has their first beta release, and I think the 15th of July is when they're

08:53.880 --> 08:57.040
trying to have their first stable release out.

08:57.040 --> 09:01.000
So you can check that out over at EndeavorOS.com.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
I'm looking forward to it.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
I think it's cool.

09:03.000 --> 09:08.000
So I think I'm still mourning the passing or the death of Korora.

09:08.000 --> 09:13.480
It was a really easy distro for me to get started when I was just starting out because

09:13.480 --> 09:16.280
the graphical interface was just so user-friendly.

09:16.280 --> 09:22.200
I think the developer had a lot to do with keeping me on Linux when I first started out.

09:22.200 --> 09:27.200
And I'm kind of afraid that with these other Linux distros kind of going away, maybe I'm

09:27.200 --> 09:31.940
missing out the chance to get the same experience with Arch without having to go through and

09:31.940 --> 09:33.480
actually compile everything myself.

09:33.480 --> 09:40.280
Yeah, there is something to both losing Ant-er-grose and Korora in the same year.

09:40.280 --> 09:44.520
I wonder if Manjaro would work for you in that scenario, or maybe in a release or two

09:44.520 --> 09:47.920
we should all just give Endeavor a go and just kind of see what we think.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.960
Maybe, you know, it could be possible.

09:49.960 --> 09:54.000
Like you already have a lot of the work done by the Ant-er-grose folks and you're following

09:54.000 --> 09:59.040
upstream Arch, which is moving fast, but it does seem like it's a possible job.

09:59.040 --> 10:00.040
It does.

10:00.040 --> 10:03.960
You know, I wonder if these are a little different too, at least seeing your rise in Fedora usage.

10:03.960 --> 10:08.560
I wonder if there's just things Fedora has now, like Fedora has changed a lot and maybe

10:08.560 --> 10:11.040
there's less need for Korora to exist.

10:11.040 --> 10:14.640
That could be it too, because the drivers are super easy to install right now.

10:14.640 --> 10:17.360
You even have H.264s there, right?

10:17.360 --> 10:23.520
And with certain RPM repos, which are becoming less and less important to me, and Flatpaks,

10:23.520 --> 10:25.600
it's kind of like everything's available now.

10:25.600 --> 10:27.760
I really don't have any software availability issues.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.240
It doesn't look bad by default?

10:29.240 --> 10:30.720
Yeah, it's come a long way.

10:30.720 --> 10:34.720
Okay, so there's just a couple other gotta talk about stories before we get to our personal

10:34.720 --> 10:35.720
favorites.

10:35.720 --> 10:37.880
Elephant in the room, almost this one.

10:37.880 --> 10:42.640
It's this really rocky, slow death of 32-bit.

10:42.640 --> 10:48.360
LibreOffice 6.3 dropped 32-bit Linux builds at the beginning of June.

10:48.360 --> 10:56.780
Obviously, we just recently had a hoopla about Ubuntu 1910s 32-bit i36 architecture support.

10:56.780 --> 10:59.940
And other projects are looking at dropping 32-bit support.

10:59.940 --> 11:04.520
Some projects are just as dependent on it as ever, like Wine and others.

11:04.520 --> 11:08.880
We didn't talk about this much at the time of the coverage, but elimination of 32-bit

11:08.880 --> 11:09.920
would really impact us.

11:09.920 --> 11:15.720
A lot of our plugins for audio processing, gosh darn it, are 32-bit.

11:15.720 --> 11:16.720
And some of them...

11:16.720 --> 11:19.400
What's this system called where it kind of actually runs them through Wine?

11:19.400 --> 11:20.400
What's that called?

11:20.400 --> 11:21.400
Do you remember?

11:21.400 --> 11:22.400
Well, there's multiple things.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.200
Carla has a bridge, but linvst...

11:24.200 --> 11:25.200
That's what I was thinking of.

11:25.200 --> 11:26.200
Yeah, linvst.

11:26.200 --> 11:31.440
There's a lot of, let's say, black magic hackery going on to integrate things over to the Windows

11:31.440 --> 11:34.120
world just enough to get this stuff to work.

11:34.120 --> 11:35.120
Yeah.

11:35.120 --> 11:39.120
And so it would have an impact on the production industry as well.

11:39.120 --> 11:40.120
And even...

11:40.120 --> 11:42.720
And I guess maybe I should have talked about that, because I really got...

11:42.720 --> 11:46.560
People did not like my take on it, because my take was, all right, well, let's look at

11:46.560 --> 11:47.560
it.

11:47.560 --> 11:51.120
Let's start pulling it out and then see if we can't use something like snaps or flat

11:51.120 --> 11:54.280
packs or cheroots or containers or...

11:54.280 --> 11:55.280
I don't care.

11:55.280 --> 11:57.560
Just update the Steam runtime library with 32-bit libraries.

11:57.560 --> 11:59.960
I just felt like there was ways to solve the problem.

11:59.960 --> 12:02.940
However, at the end, I think they came to a pretty good compromise.

12:02.940 --> 12:05.200
And now we just see which other distros push it next.

12:05.200 --> 12:06.200
Do you have any guesses?

12:06.200 --> 12:07.200
Oh, hmm.

12:07.200 --> 12:10.000
Guys, do you have any guesses on which distro might...

12:10.000 --> 12:12.440
I kind of think it could be Fedora, to tell you the truth.

12:12.440 --> 12:13.440
That's who I was thinking.

12:13.440 --> 12:18.080
I mean, at this point, what do they really have to lose in this battle?

12:18.080 --> 12:19.120
You know, they don't.

12:19.120 --> 12:21.760
And don't you think RHEL is going to go 64-bit at some point?

12:21.760 --> 12:23.440
Because, I mean, I would think...

12:23.440 --> 12:26.520
That's the future, bros and broettes.

12:26.520 --> 12:28.440
We're going to have to deal with it at some point.

12:28.440 --> 12:33.040
If they're ever going to take RHEL to 64-bit only, which would, in theory, make it more

12:33.040 --> 12:35.600
secure, don't they kind of have to take Fedora there first?

12:35.600 --> 12:36.800
They have to start with Fedora, right?

12:36.800 --> 12:37.800
I would think so.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.280
I think it could be Fedora.

12:39.280 --> 12:44.280
So I may be dogfooding this very soon, if my prediction's right and I stay on Fedora.

12:44.280 --> 12:45.840
Is this ever going to come to Windows?

12:45.840 --> 12:48.080
I mean, because that's part of the reasons we need it, right?

12:48.080 --> 12:49.440
If we lived only...

12:49.440 --> 12:54.320
If we were only using open source stuff and not messing around with Windows things, would

12:54.320 --> 12:55.720
we care about 32-bit?

12:55.720 --> 12:56.720
I don't think so.

12:56.720 --> 12:57.720
Hmm.

12:57.720 --> 13:00.040
Windows and Windows legacy, right?

13:00.040 --> 13:03.680
That Mac ecosystem, it's jumping right over it in a faster way than we are.

13:03.680 --> 13:04.680
Mm-hmm.

13:04.680 --> 13:05.680
Mm-hmm.

13:05.680 --> 13:06.680
And mobile, too.

13:06.680 --> 13:11.160
Is Microsoft only keeping 32-bit around because they're getting the same pushback from devs

13:11.160 --> 13:15.600
that have been writing 32-bit code forever and are still writing 32-bit code?

13:15.600 --> 13:20.440
I mean, they've got a whole other approach to legacy and compatibility with the past,

13:20.440 --> 13:21.440
you know?

13:21.440 --> 13:22.440
Yeah, that's got to be part of it.

13:22.440 --> 13:23.440
That's got to be part of it.

13:23.440 --> 13:28.960
The amount of customers that we had as of two years ago still running RAIL 4 makes me

13:28.960 --> 13:32.120
think, no, they're going to keep these things alive for a while.

13:32.120 --> 13:33.120
Is this when you were at Rackspace?

13:33.120 --> 13:34.760
Yeah, when I was still there.

13:34.760 --> 13:36.060
And they were still being supported.

13:36.060 --> 13:40.000
They paid enough money to have support when they needed it.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.120
Yeah, see, that's just it.

13:42.120 --> 13:50.680
Every time I, as a contractor, had gone into a client's super old systems, there's software

13:50.680 --> 13:57.320
updates and support by the vendor are not what drive...

13:57.320 --> 14:04.060
From operating systems to custom-created industry-specific applications that are two or three releases

14:04.060 --> 14:08.400
behind that don't have any support, they're still running them for whatever reason.

14:08.400 --> 14:15.960
I think with this decision that Canonical has made, and because RAIL hasn't made any

14:15.960 --> 14:23.680
changes yet, I think it's pretty easy to bet today that there will still be systems that

14:23.680 --> 14:26.720
you can load with 32-bit support by 2030.

14:26.720 --> 14:28.960
I think you're right about that, yeah.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.760
That's so crazy.

14:30.760 --> 14:34.760
We might not be using any of these systems, but they'll be sitting in boxes and closets

14:34.760 --> 14:35.760
somewhere.

14:35.760 --> 14:36.760
Oh, for sure.

14:36.760 --> 14:41.900
But I mean, I think there will still be vendor-supported operating systems by Red Hat and Canonical

14:41.900 --> 14:43.440
that support 32-bit.

14:43.440 --> 14:47.720
That'll still be like the OS still officially supports it if you get the LTS or if you're

14:47.720 --> 14:48.920
shipping RAIL.

14:48.920 --> 14:49.920
I just think that's...

14:49.920 --> 14:52.080
I mean, at what point, but it is what it is.

14:52.080 --> 14:54.760
It's the slow fade of technology.

14:54.760 --> 14:55.760
And then the last...

14:55.760 --> 14:56.960
And there's a whole list.

14:56.960 --> 15:00.160
We're just really kind of picking from the highlights here.

15:00.160 --> 15:05.360
The other one that I think we just all have to talk about is obviously, in a word, you

15:05.360 --> 15:09.920
could say Microsoft, but I think specifically the subsystem version two that is running

15:09.920 --> 15:11.380
an actual Linux kernel.

15:11.380 --> 15:13.520
The new big Linux distribution in the room.

15:13.520 --> 15:15.000
I was so sick of that joke.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.880
I was so sick of people calling like, it's the best Linux desktop.

15:17.880 --> 15:18.880
I didn't say best.

15:18.880 --> 15:19.880
I didn't say best.

15:19.880 --> 15:20.880
I know, but you know people have been saying that.

15:20.880 --> 15:21.880
Mr. Dominic.

15:21.880 --> 15:22.880
I can think of...

15:22.880 --> 15:23.880
Right.

15:23.880 --> 15:27.560
The thing is, is like, you're still booting Windows, okay?

15:27.560 --> 15:30.820
You're still loading a Linux kernel in the VM.

15:30.820 --> 15:32.080
It's not like you're booting a Linux kernel.

15:32.080 --> 15:35.240
Yeah, the NT kernel gets to do all the real work there, yeah.

15:35.240 --> 15:36.240
Yes.

15:36.240 --> 15:42.120
It's still Windows with its Windows things and millions of little paper cuts here and

15:42.120 --> 15:43.120
there.

15:43.120 --> 15:48.680
But it's still a huge win for Linux and people trying to use it and target it as a platform

15:48.680 --> 15:51.360
even if it doesn't do much for the desktop user.

15:51.360 --> 15:52.360
Yeah.

15:52.360 --> 15:55.100
Well, so we were just cracking jokes about Michael Dominic from Coder Radio, but he's

15:55.100 --> 15:59.120
in a situation right now where he's shipping a couple of Windows applications in production

15:59.120 --> 16:00.120
that he's actively maintaining.

16:00.120 --> 16:03.320
It turns out people use that operating system and want to buy software for it.

16:03.320 --> 16:07.160
And the backend software is on Linux.

16:07.160 --> 16:13.640
So he's able to maintain and support the front end on Windows, which is a Windows application,

16:13.640 --> 16:18.880
and still continue to develop and push to production and testing from Windows using

16:18.880 --> 16:22.640
Visual Studio Code into the subsystem for Linux, out to a Docker container.

16:22.640 --> 16:25.800
I mean, like the whole workflow for both sides of the app.

16:25.800 --> 16:26.800
It's probably more...

16:26.800 --> 16:27.800
Unfortunately, fortunately, I don't know.

16:27.800 --> 16:29.120
It's probably more seamless that way, right?

16:29.120 --> 16:33.240
Because Microsoft's spending a lot of time getting their hooks into this little minimal

16:33.240 --> 16:36.160
WSL2 VM.

16:36.160 --> 16:39.360
There are some solutions for running Windows pretty well virtualized on the Linux side,

16:39.360 --> 16:42.360
but I don't think it's going to be nearly as slick.

16:42.360 --> 16:50.920
Man, the future tie-in between that system, Visual Studio Code, and Visual Studio itself,

16:50.920 --> 16:54.360
as well as GitHub and Docker and Azure.

16:54.360 --> 16:56.640
It's your cloud workstation, buddy.

16:56.640 --> 16:57.640
Ooh.

16:57.640 --> 16:58.640
Wow.

16:58.640 --> 16:59.640
I mean, that is...

16:59.640 --> 17:03.720
What we are witnessing in 2019 is just the beginning.

17:03.720 --> 17:05.320
That is what people want, right?

17:05.320 --> 17:06.800
It seems like a pretty smart move.

17:06.800 --> 17:07.800
Is it?

17:07.800 --> 17:08.800
Michael Nominick does.

17:08.800 --> 17:09.800
Yeah.

17:09.800 --> 17:10.800
And I actually totally understand.

17:10.800 --> 17:13.640
If I was stuck on Windows, I'd totally understand.

17:13.640 --> 17:20.800
I try not to be that guy who's just reactionarily worried about it, but my take on where Microsoft's

17:20.800 --> 17:23.820
at right now with this whole thing, having watched them this year and the last couple

17:23.820 --> 17:30.160
of years, is they are legitimately doing what they say they're doing.

17:30.160 --> 17:35.920
And they have every incentive to do that, as they are in a growth industry right now,

17:35.920 --> 17:41.400
where there is lots of opportunity for them to grow and make money.

17:41.400 --> 17:48.360
And being open source friendly and standards compliant and interoperable is a great way

17:48.360 --> 17:49.880
to get market share.

17:49.880 --> 17:53.480
And I don't think there's any evil intent behind it at all, none.

17:53.480 --> 17:54.480
I think...

17:54.480 --> 17:58.800
I mean, other than the motive to make profit, but then we could condemn every company.

17:58.800 --> 18:05.240
I don't know what their intent will be in, say, 10 years or 15 years when the market

18:05.240 --> 18:10.260
is completely saturated and it's no longer easy pickings.

18:10.260 --> 18:12.680
It's much harder to make money.

18:12.680 --> 18:18.160
The temptation may come back to start tightening down the screws again, but that's a long ways

18:18.160 --> 18:19.160
out.

18:19.160 --> 18:25.960
And it seems silly to forfeit the benefits now just because of something that could happen.

18:25.960 --> 18:26.960
It's hard, right?

18:26.960 --> 18:33.200
They're a huge part of the software industry, field, history, culture, and it's hard to

18:33.200 --> 18:34.520
say what companies do, right?

18:34.520 --> 18:39.880
So even if you get open source ingrained into culture and management now, in 20 years, that

18:39.880 --> 18:41.080
could be a totally different setup.

18:41.080 --> 18:42.080
You just don't know.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.080
Same thing with Google.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.080
Same thing with Google.

18:44.080 --> 18:45.940
When you get different leadership in, things change.

18:45.940 --> 18:49.160
Maybe there are certain leaders that won't cross certain lines today.

18:49.160 --> 18:52.240
Future leaders may be in different situations and not have the same background and be willing

18:52.240 --> 18:53.740
to cross those lines.

18:53.740 --> 18:58.000
And you just have to stay vigilant, informed, and just continually reevaluate and make your

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
decision.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
I do think you're right, though.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.120
If anything, Microsoft's a little easier to evaluate because they're being pretty plain

19:03.120 --> 19:04.120
actors.

19:04.120 --> 19:05.400
You know, open source technology is working.

19:05.400 --> 19:06.400
It's what customers want.

19:06.400 --> 19:08.600
They can leverage it for business reasons.

19:08.600 --> 19:11.280
And it's sort of easy to understand the profit motivation.

19:11.280 --> 19:15.240
Well, I think this absolutely makes sense for Microsoft to do this, especially when

19:15.240 --> 19:24.060
you look at Red Hat, IBM, Red Hat's new universal base image, Alpine, other kind of base images

19:24.060 --> 19:29.320
that people can develop from and to have it within the desktop that you're doing your

19:29.320 --> 19:30.320
work in.

19:30.320 --> 19:32.000
I mean, that is pretty handy.

19:32.000 --> 19:37.680
But to say it's the best Linux desktop, I mean, first, we have to start at it being

19:37.680 --> 19:41.960
a desktop, which it is mediocre at, at best.

19:41.960 --> 19:43.960
Say it, baby.

19:43.960 --> 19:47.960
Well, I'm just saying, I mean, look, I work on all of these.

19:47.960 --> 19:54.360
I have all of these operating systems on a computer, on actual metal in my house.

19:54.360 --> 20:02.000
And really, Microsoft could step it up a little bit in their desktop game and their consistency

20:02.000 --> 20:06.320
and just the look and feel of the OS in and of itself.

20:06.320 --> 20:12.560
I mean, if you want to look up all of your development questions in Bing, go ahead, right?

20:12.560 --> 20:14.360
Hey, have you tried Edge?

20:14.360 --> 20:15.360
It's really fast.

20:15.360 --> 20:16.360
That's what I hear.

20:16.360 --> 20:17.360
But no.

20:17.360 --> 20:20.640
Well, Microsoft, it's been a good year for them, really.

20:20.640 --> 20:21.640
The GitHub acquisition's done.

20:21.640 --> 20:23.760
I do need to spend some time playing with that terminal.

20:23.760 --> 20:27.140
It's another one of those things where sometimes you have to use Windows, so these are nice

20:27.140 --> 20:29.680
things to have when you're in that situation.

20:29.680 --> 20:31.320
Sometimes you do have to use Windows.

20:31.320 --> 20:32.320
It happens.

20:32.320 --> 20:38.680
I recommend when you use Windows to use safe practices and run it in a VM if possible.

20:38.680 --> 20:42.200
Boy, not a ton in housekeeping today, but there's a few items.

20:42.200 --> 20:45.760
As I've been mentioning this for a couple of weeks, Linux Academy is hiring.

20:45.760 --> 20:48.640
I just recommend going to linuxacademy.com and scrolling down, they've got a careers

20:48.640 --> 20:49.640
link there.

20:49.640 --> 20:53.280
There's quite a bit of positions open from a range of development to training to some

20:53.280 --> 20:54.280
admin stuff.

20:54.280 --> 20:57.460
A lot of it's remote, full-time, with full benefits.

20:57.460 --> 21:01.120
Some of it's also at certain offices, so just check it out, linuxacademy.com.

21:01.120 --> 21:03.840
Scroll down to the careers section there.

21:03.840 --> 21:04.840
Maybe get some work.

21:04.840 --> 21:08.180
Also, I think System76 is still looking to hire for their tech support team, so shout

21:08.180 --> 21:09.180
out to them.

21:09.180 --> 21:10.800
They're doing some hiring right now.

21:10.800 --> 21:13.800
Now, I just want to make a quickie plug for the Friday stream.

21:13.800 --> 21:17.240
If you haven't listened to the Friday stream yet, it's like a bonus version of the show.

21:17.240 --> 21:22.160
A lot of the same caskets on that, and plus, everybody has a plus one sometimes, I swear.

21:22.160 --> 21:24.760
Somehow it's even more fun.

21:24.760 --> 21:26.840
We've been doing some fun stuff.

21:26.840 --> 21:30.600
In the show notes, we should put this in there, Wes, because we don't have it right now, we

21:30.600 --> 21:32.480
have a link to a form you can help us fill out.

21:32.480 --> 21:37.600
We're going to do some Linux quiz questions on the show and test people's Linux trivia

21:37.600 --> 21:38.600
knowledge.

21:38.600 --> 21:41.960
We have a lot of different kinds of interesting things like commands, history, anything you

21:41.960 --> 21:42.960
could think of.

21:42.960 --> 21:45.840
We need different levels of hardness too, like easy and hard and all that kind of stuff.

21:45.840 --> 21:48.080
We'll have a link if you want to help out with that.

21:48.080 --> 21:52.320
It's a Google form that goes into a spreadsheet, and we track everything about you.

21:52.320 --> 21:54.200
No, not really.

21:54.200 --> 21:55.200
That's not true.

21:55.200 --> 21:58.920
Check out youtube.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting for some of our more recent meetups that we've

21:58.920 --> 22:02.760
been holding, the virtual ones, different kinds of study groups on many different topics.

22:02.760 --> 22:06.520
I really, really like that burnout one that was just posted a few days ago.

22:06.520 --> 22:07.760
There's a lot going on.

22:07.760 --> 22:10.600
In fact, we got a whole new batch just on the horizon, don't we?

22:10.600 --> 22:11.600
Yep.

22:11.600 --> 22:17.280
We are getting AWS certified, so this is a great certification, even if you aren't really

22:17.280 --> 22:18.960
sure what the cloud is all about.

22:18.960 --> 22:23.160
If you want to find out more, join us at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

22:23.160 --> 22:24.160
Yeah.

22:24.160 --> 22:27.760
They'll have the details there, including some stream info and all of that.

22:27.760 --> 22:32.880
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting, where we also schedule our in-person events as well.

22:32.880 --> 22:37.600
I also just got to give a hearty plug to Mr. Wes Payne over there rocking the tech snap.

22:37.600 --> 22:40.040
We don't mention enough on the show, TechSnap.Systems.

22:40.040 --> 22:43.040
Go check it out with him and Jim Salter from Ars Technica.

22:43.040 --> 22:44.040
The one, the only.

22:44.040 --> 22:45.320
Yeah, I love Jim.

22:45.320 --> 22:46.320
You guys are great on that show.

22:46.320 --> 22:47.320
Well, thanks.

22:47.320 --> 22:48.700
So much better than when I was on that show.

22:48.700 --> 22:49.700
So much better.

22:49.700 --> 22:50.700
So check that out.

22:50.700 --> 22:53.200
We're just taking it to the next level, that's all.

22:53.200 --> 22:54.760
You guys are like a good pair, too.

22:54.760 --> 22:56.120
You guys balance each other out really well.

22:56.120 --> 22:57.120
Check that out, TechSnap.Systems.

22:57.120 --> 23:05.920
All right, well, now let's get into our favorite moments, the things that have really grabbed

23:05.920 --> 23:09.120
us and joining us now as we get into the segment.

23:09.120 --> 23:10.120
Perfect timing.

23:10.120 --> 23:11.120
Alex is here.

23:11.120 --> 23:12.120
Hello, Alex.

23:12.120 --> 23:13.120
Hi, baby.

23:13.120 --> 23:14.120
Hey there.

23:14.120 --> 23:15.120
Hey there.

23:15.120 --> 23:16.120
Thank you for joining us.

23:16.120 --> 23:18.440
And I think you're going to have some input on some of these.

23:18.440 --> 23:21.800
So let's start just really a quick acknowledgement.

23:21.800 --> 23:27.680
2019, we saw Elle, Cheese, and Drew join the team.

23:27.680 --> 23:31.720
And that's kind of amazing because it's like a variation.

23:31.720 --> 23:35.520
Drew was in the community, but he was new.

23:35.520 --> 23:39.120
Elle was in the extended community and now is like been the perfect fit.

23:39.120 --> 23:42.040
And Cheese had been in the community for like a decade.

23:42.040 --> 23:43.040
Basically forever.

23:43.040 --> 23:48.520
And I'm curious, I kind of want to take Elle's first impressions of what it's been like to

23:48.520 --> 23:51.400
podcast and then Cheese's since he's been on the outside for so long.

23:51.400 --> 23:53.020
So let's start with you, Elle.

23:53.020 --> 23:57.280
First impressions now that you've joined this team of podcasters, how's that gone?

23:57.280 --> 23:59.680
What do you think?

23:59.680 --> 24:01.160
I ask cautiously.

24:01.160 --> 24:04.200
Yeah, I think you were scared to ask that.

24:04.200 --> 24:06.120
No, it's been a lot of fun.

24:06.120 --> 24:11.200
It's been a big learning curve that I wasn't really prepared for.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.200
Everybody has a podcast.

24:12.200 --> 24:14.060
That's what everybody wants to do.

24:14.060 --> 24:19.320
And nobody, I think, really realizes if you're doing quality podcasting, how much work, how

24:19.320 --> 24:22.800
much research, and how many things you have to learn to do it right.

24:22.800 --> 24:25.640
Yeah, to do it right, it does take a lot of extra work.

24:25.640 --> 24:28.800
Turns out Chris doesn't just give you the script and then you read it on the microphone.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.360
I thought that's how it worked.

24:30.360 --> 24:31.560
Sorry about that.

24:31.560 --> 24:32.560
That's an option.

24:32.560 --> 24:37.320
And then Cheesy, I'm curious, your impressions having watched it from a long time from the

24:37.320 --> 24:41.160
outside, and now you've been brought inside the sausage factory, seeing how we put everything

24:41.160 --> 24:42.160
together.

24:42.160 --> 24:44.800
You know sometimes the meat hits the floor.

24:44.800 --> 24:47.720
What is your before and after impressions?

24:47.720 --> 24:54.120
Well, very much like Elle said, I've been listening forever, for a decade or more, and

24:54.120 --> 25:00.640
then never really, I guess, respected how much work went into it.

25:00.640 --> 25:04.640
But it was definitely interesting, especially whenever you were doing the video, how much

25:04.640 --> 25:07.120
work was going into that, I can only imagine.

25:07.120 --> 25:08.680
But being on the inside, it's great, man.

25:08.680 --> 25:09.680
I love it.

25:09.680 --> 25:10.680
It is a lot of work.

25:10.680 --> 25:12.720
There is a lot of research to do.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.440
But it's all stuff that's right up my alley.

25:14.440 --> 25:19.620
So I feel kind of privileged now because I get to find some of these news sources and

25:19.620 --> 25:26.560
some of these little tasty, juicy morsels of the Linux community before they drop for

25:26.560 --> 25:27.560
everyone else.

25:27.560 --> 25:30.200
And so to me, that's one of the coolest parts of this job.

25:30.200 --> 25:31.200
Yeah.

25:31.200 --> 25:32.200
Plus the community is just great, man.

25:32.200 --> 25:33.200
Best.

25:33.200 --> 25:34.760
Just a great group of people to work with.

25:34.760 --> 25:35.760
The best.

25:35.760 --> 25:37.080
Linux Academy is great.

25:37.080 --> 25:38.080
My team is wonderful.

25:38.080 --> 25:40.840
I mean, it's been a great experience for me.

25:40.840 --> 25:41.840
I love it.

25:41.840 --> 25:46.360
Alex is also a new member of the community and to the team.

25:46.360 --> 25:53.120
And Alex, I think one of the interesting aspects of your story is you are new to the United

25:53.120 --> 25:54.120
States.

25:54.120 --> 26:02.440
So that's a moving from London to the United States is it's a fundamental life change.

26:02.440 --> 26:05.400
And you kind of found your people almost immediately.

26:05.400 --> 26:07.520
I can't thank the community enough.

26:07.520 --> 26:14.320
So my wife and I came on holiday vacation to America last year, and we met you at Texas

26:14.320 --> 26:15.520
Linux Fest for the first time.

26:15.520 --> 26:19.080
I met Cheese also, props to him.

26:19.080 --> 26:24.520
And we stayed in touch on Telegram as part of the JB Texas group after that.

26:24.520 --> 26:27.960
When I went back to Texas Linux Fest this year, it was like meeting a group of old friends,

26:27.960 --> 26:28.960
genuinely.

26:28.960 --> 26:34.800
I mean, and the community is just, how can you describe it other than wonderful?

26:34.800 --> 26:36.720
It's really like there's these rings of community.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.520
There's people that are lightly involved.

26:38.520 --> 26:40.720
They listen and they kind of follow.

26:40.720 --> 26:44.760
There's folks that get more engaged in the different interaction mechanisms like Telegram

26:44.760 --> 26:46.360
or IRC or email or whatever.

26:46.360 --> 26:47.760
All kinds of different ways to communicate.

26:47.760 --> 26:48.760
Yeah.

26:48.760 --> 26:50.120
So it's a little bit more of a niche.

26:50.120 --> 26:55.360
And then there's like that niche of a niche where it's the people we see in person a lot

26:55.360 --> 26:57.680
and we talk to a lot.

26:57.680 --> 27:02.000
As people kind of filter into that smaller inner circle, they do become lifelong friends.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.120
It's really something.

27:04.120 --> 27:08.120
And we've just got through this massive push of events, which we'll talk about in a moment.

27:08.120 --> 27:12.360
But it has really kind of been, we've been like in a pressure cooker of events recently.

27:12.360 --> 27:14.140
So we've gotten a full dose of it.

27:14.140 --> 27:19.600
But before we go there, Wes, let's start with your big standout items of the year so far.

27:19.600 --> 27:20.600
We got to do this now.

27:20.600 --> 27:21.600
We just got to do it.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.440
If we did this at the end of the year, it'd be like a four-hour show.

27:23.440 --> 27:24.440
So we got to do it now.

27:24.440 --> 27:25.800
And I think I would have forgotten half the stuff.

27:25.800 --> 27:28.120
There's already a lot to keep track of.

27:28.120 --> 27:29.120
Yeah.

27:29.120 --> 27:30.340
Yeah, big time.

27:30.340 --> 27:37.640
You note in here, and I agree, it has been an impressive year for gaming on Linux.

27:37.640 --> 27:41.960
Technically Proton launched August of 2018, but it's really hit its refinement phase

27:41.960 --> 27:42.960
in 2019.

27:42.960 --> 27:46.480
We also got Wine 4.0 in 2019.

27:46.480 --> 27:47.800
And that's all great.

27:47.800 --> 27:51.640
But the story that really got my attention while I was doing some research for this show,

27:51.640 --> 27:53.280
that's the story of AV1.

27:53.280 --> 27:58.800
Because, Chris, I'm sure you remember the dark old days of media playback on Linux when

27:58.800 --> 28:05.160
MP3 was still super duper patent encumbered and you had to go to extra miles to just find

28:05.160 --> 28:06.520
the right codecs to install.

28:06.520 --> 28:11.360
I paid hard-earned money for the Fluendo codecs so that way I could legally watch movies and

28:11.360 --> 28:12.360
play MP3.

28:12.360 --> 28:15.360
You good citizen, you.

28:15.360 --> 28:18.880
Thanks to things like AV1, that's just not happening anymore, right?

28:18.880 --> 28:24.600
I mean, even H.264, we're in a good place now, but it hasn't always been that way.

28:24.600 --> 28:30.720
I think AV1 is a wonderful success story of different actors in this space recognizing

28:30.720 --> 28:34.920
that this is a shared layer that they can all develop in the open with open source.

28:34.920 --> 28:37.880
They don't have to compete there, and they've done it in a great way.

28:37.880 --> 28:43.480
So one example is they needed a faster decoder for AV1, right, and they have a reference

28:43.480 --> 28:46.560
one, but it's really just designed as a reference for the spec, it's not for performance.

28:46.560 --> 28:51.280
They reached out to the nonprofit behind VLC and contracted them to develop one.

28:51.280 --> 28:54.840
And now that's chipping in Firefox and it has amazing performance.

28:54.840 --> 28:56.960
Yeah, and they're seeing some adoption.

28:56.960 --> 29:02.520
I think they, you know, it's early days, like 12% of media playback is not a lot, but it's

29:02.520 --> 29:03.520
12%.

29:03.520 --> 29:07.460
And you also see, you know, big names getting involved, people like Intel and Netflix this

29:07.460 --> 29:11.440
year who are working on improving the encoding side, which might be something we'll have

29:11.440 --> 29:12.620
to play with as well.

29:12.620 --> 29:13.840
That's going to help a lot.

29:13.840 --> 29:15.880
Oh, let's give Elle a chance here.

29:15.880 --> 29:19.600
Elle, what kind of stood out to you this year so far in 2019?

29:19.600 --> 29:24.320
The one that stood out the most to me was the one that affected me coming before I came

29:24.320 --> 29:25.320
here.

29:25.320 --> 29:26.960
I came from an OpenStack background.

29:26.960 --> 29:32.520
So when OpenStack Summit announced that they were going to be turning into the Open Infrastructure

29:32.520 --> 29:37.880
Summit, I didn't think a lot about it and now looking back, I really wish I would have

29:37.880 --> 29:42.200
because I think it really would have outlined what my year was going to look like.

29:42.200 --> 29:48.680
It really has gone from having several different types of conferences to almost every conference

29:48.680 --> 29:53.600
that I go to being focused around containers and more specifically Kubernetes.

29:53.600 --> 29:54.600
Yeah.

29:54.600 --> 30:00.080
I think the moment when you, when you report it back from DockerCon and you're like, ah,

30:00.080 --> 30:02.020
Kubernetes is basically taken over.

30:02.020 --> 30:03.740
It's like a Kubernetes conference now.

30:03.740 --> 30:04.740
That's when it hit.

30:04.740 --> 30:05.740
That's when it really hit us.

30:05.740 --> 30:09.680
It's like it is that the Docker hype has been superseded by the Kubernetes hype and it's

30:09.680 --> 30:12.120
taking over these different events.

30:12.120 --> 30:13.840
It's like maximum hype mode now.

30:13.840 --> 30:14.840
Hyper hype.

30:14.840 --> 30:17.280
Hybrid cloud, hybrid cloud hype.

30:17.280 --> 30:20.720
Now, there's also the community aspect for this year too.

30:20.720 --> 30:24.360
And I think that's something that I don't know if I just kind of took it and ran from

30:24.360 --> 30:28.600
it or it's something that you guys were doing before I came here, but when I went to scale

30:28.600 --> 30:34.200
and it was my very first scale I've ever gone to, you guys hosted a dinner after the event

30:34.200 --> 30:35.200
and it was different.

30:35.200 --> 30:40.400
Like you get to meet people at conferences and you have short talks during the halls

30:40.400 --> 30:45.120
or when you're waiting for talks to start, but you don't get to really know someone.

30:45.120 --> 30:48.800
And when we were sitting there having dinner, people start talking about the projects that

30:48.800 --> 30:49.800
they were working on.

30:49.800 --> 30:53.480
You know, you'll hear somebody just kind of like, well, you don't know where I work at,

30:53.480 --> 30:57.740
but hypothetically, and you kind of get to find out what people are really doing on their

30:57.740 --> 30:58.740
spare time.

30:58.740 --> 30:59.740
Yeah.

30:59.740 --> 31:00.740
I love that.

31:00.740 --> 31:01.740
So I just kind of kicked off with that.

31:01.740 --> 31:05.920
And then I have what I call hacker family dinners where we just get together and it's

31:05.920 --> 31:11.560
NDA is understood and we just come, we break bread and we get to really know one another.

31:11.560 --> 31:12.960
And it's been an amazing experience.

31:12.960 --> 31:15.960
It really is a great way to get to know someone, sharing a meal.

31:15.960 --> 31:16.960
Yeah.

31:16.960 --> 31:17.960
Yeah.

31:17.960 --> 31:20.920
It has been, it has, like I was just saying, Cheese, it's been like the pressure cookers

31:20.920 --> 31:21.920
section of events.

31:21.920 --> 31:26.320
Like we've just been doing event after event, a lot of stuff going on in 2019 so far.

31:26.320 --> 31:27.320
Absolutely, man.

31:27.320 --> 31:30.640
So the first half of the year, right before I came on and Ella had mentioned it, you guys

31:30.640 --> 31:35.160
were at scale, super jelly, just missed it, just missed it.

31:35.160 --> 31:37.640
And I really, really, really, really, really wanted to go.

31:37.640 --> 31:43.960
But you know, and then on the family dinner thing, we should do a potluck.

31:43.960 --> 31:46.440
That would be interesting to see what everyone would bring, right?

31:46.440 --> 31:47.560
That would be good.

31:47.560 --> 31:52.080
So scale was the first part of the year and then moved into Linux Fest Northwest, which

31:52.080 --> 31:57.760
is kind of the Jupiter Broadcasting home base conference.

31:57.760 --> 31:58.760
So fun.

31:58.760 --> 31:59.760
Wow.

31:59.760 --> 32:00.760
Linux Fest was so crazy.

32:00.760 --> 32:01.760
Crazy.

32:01.760 --> 32:02.760
I hope it wasn't peak Linux Fest.

32:02.760 --> 32:07.440
You know, the thing that was, the thing about Linux Fest this year is we just said, Chase,

32:07.440 --> 32:09.040
just take care of the video for us.

32:09.040 --> 32:10.040
Just I'm done with videos.

32:10.040 --> 32:11.600
I am so glad we did.

32:11.600 --> 32:15.320
And then we used that extra time to start up that room and it was packed.

32:15.320 --> 32:16.320
Amazing.

32:16.320 --> 32:18.520
I think that's going to be something we'll have to repeat.

32:18.520 --> 32:19.520
Absolutely.

32:19.520 --> 32:24.040
I think the room was, we had to end up turning people away from the room and they still came

32:24.040 --> 32:25.440
in anyway.

32:25.440 --> 32:28.000
But Elle had a talk there, Alex had a talk there.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
Jim had a talk there.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
I did.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
Jim just joined us.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
Hey, Jim.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
What's going on?

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
Oh, you know, just doing some podcasting.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.200
We were just talking about TechSnap a little bit ago.

32:36.200 --> 32:37.200
Yes, Jim did talk.

32:37.200 --> 32:38.200
Anyways, continue on, cheese.

32:38.200 --> 32:39.200
Can't forget Alan.

32:39.200 --> 32:40.680
Alan was there too doing his talks.

32:40.680 --> 32:41.680
Oh yeah, Mr. Jude.

32:41.680 --> 32:44.000
That was an amazing JB family turnout.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.080
That was really good.

32:45.080 --> 32:46.080
It was really awesome.

32:46.080 --> 32:47.080
It was really awesome.

32:47.080 --> 32:52.840
And then right after that, two weeks after that, Chris, myself, and Wes were all off

32:52.840 --> 32:57.880
to Boston for Red Hat Summit, of course, where all of that news kind of trickled out.

32:57.880 --> 33:01.760
I shouldn't say trickled out, but all that news kind of came out of that.

33:01.760 --> 33:02.760
Burst it out.

33:02.760 --> 33:07.040
And that was the release where the new RHEL was out, new version of OpenShift was out,

33:07.040 --> 33:09.220
Satya Nadella up on stage.

33:09.220 --> 33:12.880
The Red Hatter over here was very jealous that he wasn't there.

33:12.880 --> 33:15.520
Ironically, you weren't there, but we were.

33:15.520 --> 33:20.240
Red carpet treatment, lasers, like it was a real show.

33:20.240 --> 33:24.480
And we have blog posts of all of these that we were at, so if you'd like to go back and

33:24.480 --> 33:27.520
look at some of these and read and kind of look at some of the pictures and kind of check

33:27.520 --> 33:31.920
out the event, you can do that at LinuxUnplugged.com.

33:31.920 --> 33:36.800
Also Clear Linux, you and Brent went off to the Intel campus to check out Clear Linux.

33:36.800 --> 33:38.100
Yeah, down to Portland.

33:38.100 --> 33:41.480
And you all had an interesting stay at, I think it was the Jupiter Hotel or something

33:41.480 --> 33:42.480
like that?

33:42.480 --> 33:50.360
Yeah, we stayed at the Jupiter Hotel and made good connections with the community manager

33:50.360 --> 33:51.360
for Clear Linux.

33:51.360 --> 33:52.840
That was really nice.

33:52.840 --> 33:56.160
And got unique swag from the Jupiter Hotel, which we actually still have in the studio

33:56.160 --> 33:57.160
with us right now.

33:57.160 --> 33:58.160
Oh, do you?

33:58.160 --> 34:01.280
You'll have to listen to the episode, though, to find out what it is, because let's just

34:01.280 --> 34:04.700
say I don't want to bring the episode down.

34:04.700 --> 34:10.200
And then after that was KubeCon, where Wes and El were off at KubeCon.

34:10.200 --> 34:11.280
Oh, yeah.

34:11.280 --> 34:12.880
In Spain.

34:12.880 --> 34:15.400
I was super jealous of that one as well.

34:15.400 --> 34:19.280
Not jealous of your travels per se, but that it looked like a blast.

34:19.280 --> 34:20.280
Work is so hard.

34:20.280 --> 34:21.280
Yeah.

34:21.280 --> 34:23.640
Yeah, but that flight, you paid for it with that flight.

34:23.640 --> 34:24.640
That sounded awful.

34:24.640 --> 34:25.640
Yep.

34:25.640 --> 34:31.380
And then after that, Texas Linux Fest, of course, where it was pretty much a big chunk

34:31.380 --> 34:32.600
of the crew there.

34:32.600 --> 34:35.600
El gave a killer talk at Texas Linux Fest.

34:35.600 --> 34:37.760
She gave her confessions of a sysadmin talk.

34:37.760 --> 34:41.920
Alex has done his talk again there, his home automation talk at Texas Linux Fest.

34:41.920 --> 34:46.800
And then right after that, the week after, because El is like a machine, she was down

34:46.800 --> 34:48.840
at B-Sides in San Antonio.

34:48.840 --> 34:49.840
She is a machine.

34:49.840 --> 34:55.560
So it's been a busy, busy, busy season for us so far, and I expect we're going to have

34:55.560 --> 34:57.000
a few more coming down the pike.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
Yeah.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
We're not done yet.

34:59.000 --> 35:02.920
A little birdie tells me we may be at Texas Cyber Summit in October.

35:02.920 --> 35:03.920
See, what?

35:03.920 --> 35:04.920
Leak alert, leak alert.

35:04.920 --> 35:05.920
A little birdie tells me that.

35:05.920 --> 35:08.720
You know, those little birdies, if they're talking about October, they got to be talking

35:08.720 --> 35:10.600
about All Things Open and Raleigh, right?

35:10.600 --> 35:11.600
Oh, maybe.

35:11.600 --> 35:12.600
We could do both.

35:12.600 --> 35:13.800
Are you coming to Raleigh, Jim?

35:13.800 --> 35:15.240
Oh, I'm absolutely going to Raleigh.

35:15.240 --> 35:16.560
I'm at All Things Open every year.

35:16.560 --> 35:17.560
It's a huge show.

35:17.560 --> 35:18.560
Oh, awesome.

35:18.560 --> 35:19.560
I'll have to buy you a beer.

35:19.560 --> 35:20.560
I live like four miles from the tower.

35:20.560 --> 35:21.560
Oh, yeah.

35:21.560 --> 35:22.560
Cool.

35:22.560 --> 35:23.560
Awesome.

35:23.560 --> 35:24.560
Look forward to that.

35:24.560 --> 35:25.560
I kind of want to be there.

35:25.560 --> 35:26.560
I want to be at that table.

35:26.560 --> 35:27.560
I want to be sharing those beers.

35:27.560 --> 35:32.120
So, Jim, what's struck you about the news so far in 2019 in Linux and open source?

35:32.120 --> 35:34.360
Well, I mean, for me, it's a no brainer, man.

35:34.360 --> 35:36.800
ZFS 0.8 coming out, it's huge.

35:36.800 --> 35:37.800
Yes.

35:37.800 --> 35:38.800
Yeah.

35:38.800 --> 35:44.640
Also, I mean, the rebase, right, on ZFS for FreeBSD and other projects, rebasing on ZFS

35:44.640 --> 35:45.640
for Linux?

35:45.640 --> 35:46.640
Yeah, absolutely.

35:46.640 --> 35:51.520
I mean, so, you know, all the new features in 0.8, like native encryption and, you know,

35:51.520 --> 35:55.800
encrypted send and receive, those are all like, those are the big sexy things, right?

35:55.800 --> 36:00.440
But the rebase is really cool because it means that all the platforms get to get more tightly

36:00.440 --> 36:03.240
integrated in the future, you know?

36:03.240 --> 36:08.640
Removing BSD and Linux are going to be, you know, kind of one happy family in the same

36:08.640 --> 36:15.800
GitHub repositories and, you know, open ZFS is going to become more of a thing rather than

36:15.800 --> 36:21.920
like a concept that, you know, ZFS on Linux and FreeBSD ZFS and, you know, on down the

36:21.920 --> 36:25.360
line are just sort of adhering to, you know?

36:25.360 --> 36:28.320
I'm really glad you joined to point that out because that wasn't on any of our lists for

36:28.320 --> 36:29.320
some reason.

36:29.320 --> 36:30.320
That's a big oversight.

36:30.320 --> 36:34.000
Having had some great ZFS on Linux success just in the recent past.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.880
We take it for granted because it's so awesome.

36:35.880 --> 36:36.880
Yeah, definitely.

36:36.880 --> 36:37.880
Definitely.

36:37.880 --> 36:40.800
Just to highlight the value of community and things like that, Jim, you gave an excellent

36:40.800 --> 36:47.760
talk along with Alan at Linux Fest Northwest about ZFS and ever since I have been using

36:47.760 --> 36:51.800
it and we exchanged messages on Twitter and things like that and, yeah, I just want, you

36:51.800 --> 36:55.480
know, when people talk about community, that's the kind of thing that we mean, right?

36:55.480 --> 37:00.600
You meet these people in meet space, in the real world, you exchange messages on Twitter

37:00.600 --> 37:06.560
afterwards and you end up changing your workflows and adopting new technologies as a consequence.

37:06.560 --> 37:07.560
Absolutely.

37:07.560 --> 37:11.560
So, Alex, if you hit the point now where you're like, I don't know how I ever got by without

37:11.560 --> 37:13.080
ZFS.

37:13.080 --> 37:14.200
I kind of did recently.

37:14.200 --> 37:15.200
I did that.

37:15.200 --> 37:19.880
When we switched from FreeNAS over to Fedora and we could keep the same pool and we just

37:19.880 --> 37:24.560
swapped out the operating system and we installed a radically newer, more updated operating

37:24.560 --> 37:29.080
system and we were able to reconnect those pools and everything worked just fine, I was

37:29.080 --> 37:31.360
like, okay, that's legit.

37:31.360 --> 37:32.360
That's legitimate.

37:32.360 --> 37:37.320
I must admit, my mind blew a little bit when I started using ZFS Send over WireGuard this

37:37.320 --> 37:38.680
weekend though.

37:38.680 --> 37:39.680
That was cool.

37:39.680 --> 37:40.680
Yeah.

37:40.680 --> 37:47.280
I mean, the remote replication, there's just, yeah, unless you're spending, you know, $100,000

37:47.280 --> 37:51.400
and using some proprietary system, there's just nothing else like it.

37:51.400 --> 37:52.400
Yeah.

37:52.400 --> 37:53.400
Yeah, it's been really cool.

37:53.400 --> 37:54.400
All right.

37:54.400 --> 37:55.720
Let's get us up here.

37:55.720 --> 37:58.680
Honorable mentions from Drew because he couldn't join us.

37:58.680 --> 38:02.880
Gnome's readoption and just the flurry of improvements since now multiple different

38:02.880 --> 38:08.600
teams like Canonical and LIS and obviously Red Hat and whatnot are working on it as well

38:08.600 --> 38:11.480
as just the rapid pace of improvement in general.

38:11.480 --> 38:16.360
I had a couple of call outs, number one, going back to Microsoft, the fact that Microsoft

38:16.360 --> 38:21.000
is now publicly admitting and I use that word intentionally that Linux is the dominant OS

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
on Azure.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
I've been hearing that for a while.

38:23.000 --> 38:28.320
I'd heard 60% a year ago from somebody who would know.

38:28.320 --> 38:32.600
So I think it's been that way for a while and I think it's a lot more now.

38:32.600 --> 38:35.440
And that kind of tells you the direction their compass is pointed right now.

38:35.440 --> 38:40.040
The story that surprised me, Pi 4 in 2019, expected I'd have to wait.

38:40.040 --> 38:41.280
Who'd have thought?

38:41.280 --> 38:42.280
And I got one.

38:42.280 --> 38:44.760
I ordered it, it hasn't arrived yet, but I got the four gig desktop.

38:44.760 --> 38:45.880
Oh, I'm excited.

38:45.880 --> 38:48.800
Did you see the news about the USB-C flaw on the fours though?

38:48.800 --> 38:50.720
That really bugs me, Jim.

38:50.720 --> 38:52.520
I hate that crap.

38:52.520 --> 38:54.760
USB-C's already been a hot mess as it is.

38:54.760 --> 38:56.800
We didn't need this complication.

38:56.800 --> 38:59.760
Yeah, I did order with a power adapter though.

38:59.760 --> 39:01.760
I suppose nothing can be perfect.

39:01.760 --> 39:08.240
And hey, winter is coming, so you've got a free space heater right there.

39:08.240 --> 39:09.800
I might try one of those water coolers.

39:09.800 --> 39:13.400
I've seen a couple of water cooling solutions pop up online, that's just adorable.

39:13.400 --> 39:16.600
It's just adorable, so I may do that.

39:16.600 --> 39:21.160
And then if they launch an eight gig next year with the USB-C fix so it can take any

39:21.160 --> 39:25.640
power adapter, then I'll buy that too, because you know what, it's 30 bucks.

39:25.640 --> 39:31.440
So the other thing I didn't quite see coming, but it makes sense, is Mozilla's hard shift

39:31.440 --> 39:33.160
into services.

39:33.160 --> 39:38.160
There's been a lot of different things around this recently, but I just, I think it's time.

39:38.160 --> 39:42.640
It kind of makes me sad a little bit on the inside that this is the way it has to go,

39:42.640 --> 39:46.100
but if this gets them off Google Sauce, good enough.

39:46.100 --> 39:47.480
And then the last two.

39:47.480 --> 39:51.920
Number one, I got to admit when I was wrong, Pop!OS has had a damn good year.

39:51.920 --> 39:54.720
You know what, part of it has been hustle on System76's part.

39:54.720 --> 39:55.960
Oh yeah, absolutely.

39:55.960 --> 40:01.920
Part of it has been a keen, consistent design language that has connected with people, and

40:01.920 --> 40:05.460
then making those easily available online, which helps sort of spread the hype.

40:05.460 --> 40:11.200
And then part of it has been good media coverage, because they positioned their desktop OS in

40:11.200 --> 40:15.560
a way that made it presentable to certain individuals, and it got good coverage.

40:15.560 --> 40:19.800
And when you combine those things, it's been a pretty good year for Pop!OS.

40:19.800 --> 40:21.640
I didn't see it coming.

40:21.640 --> 40:26.360
Just in the last two weeks, you've had Linus Tech Tips do videos on Pop!OS.

40:26.360 --> 40:31.200
You've had Wendell from Level One extolling the virtues of Pop!OS with PCI Pass-Through.

40:31.200 --> 40:33.920
So yeah, whatever they're doing, they're doing a good job.

40:33.920 --> 40:34.920
I'll say this too.

40:34.920 --> 40:41.400
I think in retrospect, my biggest concern was a lack of time to work on it, just because

40:41.400 --> 40:42.400
they have so many other initiatives.

40:42.400 --> 40:44.160
There's a lot going on, yeah.

40:44.160 --> 40:45.160
You know what though?

40:45.160 --> 40:48.200
There are a lot of popular distros out there that are much smaller teams, when you think

40:48.200 --> 40:49.200
about it.

40:49.200 --> 40:52.000
And they're not even full-time employees of a company, where there's a no-consistency

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
story.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.800
I think when I first came out, we were kind of wondering, all right, well, is this just

40:54.800 --> 40:58.520
a slight customization, you know, a distro for their machines?

40:58.520 --> 41:00.160
But no, I mean, it's grown into much more than that.

41:00.160 --> 41:03.760
I am glad I always couched it with, I'm curious to see where they take it, because they could

41:03.760 --> 41:05.040
add more stuff.

41:05.040 --> 41:09.480
And when they switched up the installer, when they worked with the elementary OS team to

41:09.480 --> 41:13.760
do their own pop shop and stuff, I think they added a few key differentiators there, and

41:13.760 --> 41:14.760
they're continuing to build on that.

41:14.760 --> 41:15.760
We'll see where it goes.

41:15.760 --> 41:18.640
I'm not running it yet, but I'll probably give it a go soon.

41:18.640 --> 41:21.440
And then last but not least, this one didn't surprise me.

41:21.440 --> 41:27.560
I'm just, I guess I'm impressed with the very, just sort of like everybody showed up to this

41:27.560 --> 41:30.240
game, which is streaming, game streaming.

41:30.240 --> 41:35.440
Stadia is sort of the forefront in our community, but Microsoft has a solution, Nvidia has a

41:35.440 --> 41:43.360
solution, Sony has a solution, and then Apple has their subscription service, which is not

41:43.360 --> 41:47.080
game streaming per se, but it's sort of like all-you-can-eat games that download to the

41:47.080 --> 41:49.920
iOS device as you need it.

41:49.920 --> 41:52.480
So kind of like game streaming, except it's offline.

41:52.480 --> 41:54.280
On-demand games as you need them.

41:54.280 --> 41:55.280
Yeah.

41:55.280 --> 42:00.200
Those have been sort of my eye poppers or surprises or, like I said, sometimes corrections

42:00.200 --> 42:01.680
I think I need to make.

42:01.680 --> 42:02.680
That Pop OS one.

42:02.680 --> 42:05.360
How did you not see gaming as a service coming, though, Chris?

42:05.360 --> 42:06.600
Not so much I didn't see it coming.

42:06.600 --> 42:12.760
I think, you're right, because I actually was an OnLive beta user back in the day, and

42:12.760 --> 42:17.160
I actually have an Nvidia GeForce streaming service active subscription, so I actually

42:17.160 --> 42:22.420
do some gaming streaming, but I think what I didn't expect is that everybody would show

42:22.420 --> 42:23.420
up.

42:23.420 --> 42:25.000
It kind of popped all together right at the same time.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
Yeah.

42:26.000 --> 42:29.800
Like Microsoft, Sony, and Google all just like, hey, by the way, boom.

42:29.800 --> 42:34.640
But you know, it's really, when you look at it in the term, like the services world where

42:34.640 --> 42:38.080
everybody's trying to grow their services revenue, they've got to do everything they

42:38.080 --> 42:39.080
can, right?

42:39.080 --> 42:41.080
Everybody's got to get that reoccurring revenue.

42:41.080 --> 42:42.080
Woo.

42:42.080 --> 42:44.360
It does make sense in that context quite a bit.

42:44.360 --> 42:48.960
I hate to admit it, but I bought the Stadia Founders pack thing.

42:48.960 --> 42:50.720
Why do you hate to admit it, Chris?

42:50.720 --> 42:55.040
Because it's 180 bucks for a Google game streaming service that is probably going to get shut

42:55.040 --> 42:56.520
down in four years.

42:56.520 --> 42:59.120
Well, it could be more expensive.

42:59.120 --> 43:00.840
You just divide it by four, it's fine.

43:00.840 --> 43:01.840
Yeah, yeah.

43:01.840 --> 43:02.840
Actually, but you know what?

43:02.840 --> 43:03.840
I do it for the people.

43:03.840 --> 43:04.840
Well, at least-

43:04.840 --> 43:05.880
I am very curious.

43:05.880 --> 43:08.760
At least you still end up with a Chromecast, right?

43:08.760 --> 43:09.760
You know what?

43:09.760 --> 43:10.760
Good point.

43:10.760 --> 43:12.640
It's a controller I could probably use for something else.

43:12.640 --> 43:13.640
Exactly.

43:13.640 --> 43:17.880
Well, and let's not pretend any of us hasn't wasted more than $180 on some project that

43:17.880 --> 43:18.880
didn't pan out.

43:18.880 --> 43:19.880
Touche.

43:19.880 --> 43:20.880
Man, thanks, guys.

43:20.880 --> 43:22.440
You're making me feel a lot better about my impulsive decisions.

43:22.440 --> 43:25.000
We just all bought it too and want to play there with you.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.280
Yeah, that's what it is.

43:26.280 --> 43:27.880
I'll have it set up here at the studio.

43:27.880 --> 43:31.120
I compare those kinds of media boxes to the Nvidia Shield.

43:31.120 --> 43:38.640
I bought one four years ago for 150 pounds, and yeah, that thing's still my main media

43:38.640 --> 43:39.640
machine.

43:39.640 --> 43:44.920
But if you get four or five years out of it, I think, for that kind of money, it's good.

43:44.920 --> 43:48.880
The future of this technology is all virtual GPUs and that kind of thing, so it's not a

43:48.880 --> 43:52.940
one-to-one relationship with the hardware they have to have in their data centers.

43:52.940 --> 43:56.600
And they're using some of the pass-through type technologies we talked about a couple

43:56.600 --> 43:59.640
of weeks ago to make this a reality.

43:59.640 --> 44:03.640
This technology is just super duper cool, and these are the use cases that happen as

44:03.640 --> 44:04.640
a consequence.

44:04.640 --> 44:06.240
It's a lot of fun.

44:06.240 --> 44:11.520
And Stadia could have longer-term ramifications for Google's other platforms, obviously, Chromebooks.

44:11.520 --> 44:17.320
I mean, that's a given, but you could imagine a future where game developers could accelerate

44:17.320 --> 44:23.680
a portion of their Android game on a Google GPU cloud if they're on an Android client

44:23.680 --> 44:29.240
that doesn't support those GPU extensions or isn't fast enough or the battery life is

44:29.240 --> 44:30.240
low.

44:30.240 --> 44:34.680
Why not just sort of offload some of that and have some bits of it just stream back

44:34.680 --> 44:35.680
down to the client?

44:35.680 --> 44:36.680
I like that.

44:36.680 --> 44:37.680
You break your phone.

44:37.680 --> 44:38.680
You switch to your backup phone.

44:38.680 --> 44:39.680
You keep playing all the games you have.

44:39.680 --> 44:40.680
Not if you're Huawei, though.

44:40.680 --> 44:41.680
No.

44:41.680 --> 44:42.680
Oh, too soon.

44:42.680 --> 44:43.680
Too soon.

44:43.680 --> 44:44.680
Way too soon.

44:44.680 --> 44:47.840
Go get some Jim and Wes over at TechSnap again, TechSnap.Systems.

44:47.840 --> 44:49.800
It's a great show.

44:49.800 --> 44:52.240
Go check out Elle over at Choose Linux.

44:52.240 --> 44:59.400
She joins Drew and Joe on a new revamped, refreshed, and better-than-ever Choose Linux.

44:59.400 --> 45:00.680
Love the last couple of episodes.

45:00.680 --> 45:03.160
Go check those out, ChooseLinux.Show.

45:03.160 --> 45:07.400
And maybe we can get them to try Endeavor and report back to us.

45:07.400 --> 45:09.360
I like you delegating, Wes.

45:09.360 --> 45:10.360
Look at you.

45:10.360 --> 45:11.360
Whoopsie.

45:11.360 --> 45:12.680
That's some management-level thinking right there.

45:12.680 --> 45:13.680
All right.

45:13.680 --> 45:16.840
In the meantime, go to LinuxOmplug.com for all of our links, subscription stuff, and

45:16.840 --> 45:17.840
whatnots.

45:17.840 --> 45:46.080
It's Live on Tuesdays over at jblive.tv, where we'll see you then.
