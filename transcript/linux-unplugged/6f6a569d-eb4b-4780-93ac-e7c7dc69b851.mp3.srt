1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,020
How about we start things off with a little good news?

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:03,940
This is something you don't hear too often.

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,820
It turns out there could be way more free books

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,140
than we realized.

5
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,500
Millions of books may have been in public domain

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,700
for a long time, and just nobody ever checked.

7
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,200
Yeah, right.

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,980
So I guess prior to 1964, books had a 28-year copyright term.

9
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,140
But to extend it, you actually had to send in a separate form.

10
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,820
And of course, with no internet, no easy way to do that,

11
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:28,980
are you really going to?

12
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:29,980
Who has the time?

13
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,660
Turns out not that many people.

14
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,620
Thankfully, the New York Public Library

15
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,460
has done a whole bunch of work to go find out

16
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,260
which of these books are out there,

17
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,220
and now you can download them online.

18
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,380
Yeah, you can search the whole thing.

19
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,100
There's literally millions from 1923 to 1964

20
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,780
that are now in public domain.

21
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:51,780
I bet we will discover in a few weeks some great old books

22
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,000
about computers.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,700
I think it's great to be aware of these things, too, right?

24
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,600
Because that's part of how this should work.

25
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,660
After a time, it should be part of the commons,

26
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,180
and we can all learn from, use, sample, whatever.

27
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,100
I love free books.

28
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:02,900
This is great.

29
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,640
One challenge I have with that is that there's literally

30
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,420
millions of books.

31
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,300
So how do you know which one to start with?

32
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,580
Or how to, you know, it's just like a giant dump.

33
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,180
So is there anybody curating?

34
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,460
I think in a few weeks, you'll start seeing that.

35
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,080
You'll see people that are adventurous,

36
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,340
and they go look it up.

37
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,580
And they find some historical person

38
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,500
from different industries.

39
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,300
I bet there'll be books about photography.

40
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,740
There'll be books about computers.

41
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,300
There'll be about the, you know, very fundamentals from back then

42
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,660
that we take for granted now.

43
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,140
I actually, I'm willing to bet in a few weeks, maybe

44
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,500
a few months, maybe even a year or two,

45
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,020
things will surface that are absolutely fascinating.

46
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,620
Yeah, I find this also very dangerous because I remember

47
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,900
spending a week just going through Project Gutenberg

48
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,620
trying to see which books were worthy of my time.

49
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,180
Oh, yeah.

50
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,620
It's going to be a rabbit hole, a big old rabbit hole.

51
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,460
Bring it on.

52
00:01:49,460 --> 00:02:01,620
Oh, hey there, and welcome into Linux Unplugged, episode 313.

53
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,340
My name is Chris.

54
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,220
My name is Wes.

55
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:03,980
Hey there, Wes.

56
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,700
Hello.

57
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,940
Guess what?

58
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,420
I'm very excited about today's show.

59
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,220
Huge show.

60
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,060
You know, it happens sometimes.

61
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,780
This was going to be the episode, though,

62
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,260
that I was really dreading.

63
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,300
Oh, yeah.

64
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,020
Oh, I could tell.

65
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,500
Yeah, we had to put in a little extra effort,

66
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,620
but we got something really special out of this week's

67
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,380
episode, so I'm pretty happy we did it.

68
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,740
And I mean, how often can I say this?

69
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,780
We're going to do things differently from here on out

70
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,260
after this episode.

71
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,220
How about that?

72
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:31,820
How about that?

73
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,660
I'm excited.

74
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,020
Mr. Cheese Bacon is here, too.

75
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,540
Hey, Cheesy.

76
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,740
Hey, what's going on, guys?

77
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,620
Oh, you know, doing a podcast.

78
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,060
Other than that, not much.

79
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,580
Pretty good.

80
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,260
Nice.

81
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,620
Yeah, you know, podcast is life.

82
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,940
And of course, our virtual lug is here.

83
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,740
Time-appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

84
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,860
Hello.

85
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,660
Hello.

86
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,220
Hello.

87
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,260
I see CM, and Mini Mac, and Hawkins, and Brent,

88
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,700
and Popeye's been lurking in there,

89
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,700
and Emacs from Answers up there in the quiet listening as well.

90
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,060
So that's a nice showing on Tuesday.

91
00:02:59,060 --> 00:02:59,900
Glad to have you all.

92
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,780
On a warm Tuesday afternoon.

93
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,600
And we have many in the jblive.tv chat room, too.

94
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,380
So it's nice to see everybody here.

95
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,620
Why don't we kick a few things off with community news,

96
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,400
and then we'll get into my thoughts on the Raspberry Pi

97
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,620
4 as a desktop.

98
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,960
I did get the desktop kit.

99
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,700
It arrived a week ago.

100
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,220
Been using it for a week, and I have some thoughts.

101
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,420
But community news first, Mr. Payne.

102
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,740
We follow up with the topic we talked about last week

103
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,100
with one of the co-founders of Manjaro, Philip,

104
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,780
about bundling free office by default

105
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,100
in a future version of Manjaro.

106
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,180
They've updated their decision.

107
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,980
They've done a bit of a 180, not a complete 180, maybe.

108
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,900
Pick an angle here.

109
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,400
Come on.

110
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:40,980
Maybe a 90.

111
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,700
OK.

112
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,060
It's a pivot.

113
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,780
And they will offer the user choice during installation,

114
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,540
LibreOffice, FreeOffice, or NoOffice.

115
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,740
So as an additional install time option.

116
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,900
What do you think of that?

117
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,520
Not so bad.

118
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,480
I mean, really, it seems fine, right?

119
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,220
If you want to have more choice, why not?

120
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,260
You can have a default. This is a way of not.

121
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,220
I suppose there's probably still a default, right,

122
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,320
in whichever radio button is selected first.

123
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,220
I think myself, I'd choose the NoOffice version.

124
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,180
Yeah, same.

125
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,780
I prefer not to have one.

126
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,600
I bounced this idea off of Joe on Linux Action News,

127
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,060
and I want to bounce it off of you guys a little bit.

128
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,180
It feels a little bit like the outrage crew showed up

129
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,540
and got the developers to change their plans,

130
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,460
like they were going to do something kind of bold

131
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,020
and differentiating, and they were

132
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,860
going to take a bit of a dramatic step, something that's

133
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,660
a bigger step than you normally see a distribution take.

134
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,180
And instead, they ended up doing something

135
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,300
that's not quite as aggressive, not quite as differentiating.

136
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,820
Again, side note, I actually think

137
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,980
it's the right way to go.

138
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,180
But I'm playing devil's advocate here, cheese.

139
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,980
Are we not, once again, seeing outrage-led development

140
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,580
in open source and with social media and the forums and blogs

141
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,580
and podcasts, although I think we did a pretty good job,

142
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,940
but of course I would think that.

143
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,100
Are we not seeing an outrage machine

144
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,140
that generates reactions so fast that developers are just

145
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,940
inundated, and then they scramble,

146
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,860
and then we get compromises?

147
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,860
I mean, I think that it does get hammed up, right,

148
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:10,660
within all the Linux circles and how

149
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,700
it's really easy to just go after someone

150
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:18,580
and attack them for not using the most obvious free option

151
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,220
available and trying something different.

152
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,680
I really admire Manjaro for stepping out of the box

153
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,980
and trying something different.

154
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:29,460
I agree with you that it's not a step back.

155
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,780
It's kind of a sidestep.

156
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,520
They didn't roll all the way back.

157
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,940
This isn't one of those things where

158
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,020
I feel like they're still standing their ground.

159
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,260
I'll put it that way.

160
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:45,900
I don't feel that the devs were completely pressured to do this.

161
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,300
And it's something that we're going to have to accept,

162
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,380
I think, as a Linux community, that these things are

163
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,060
going to happen and that distributions are

164
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,220
going to evolve.

165
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,900
And that means partnering with other people.

166
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,780
And really, at the end of the day, you still have your choice.

167
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,860
If you don't want free office, you don't have to use it.

168
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,180
You can install something else.

169
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,060
Like you said, they have different installers,

170
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,660
which will allow you to select.

171
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,600
You've also got the Archetype, or I

172
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,980
think it's the Architect edition of Manjaro.

173
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,220
So you can really dial in.

174
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,860
I've heard backlash on, oh, well, they only

175
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,820
limit you and pigeonhole you to 1D.

176
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,900
Well, you can use their own spin and build it out

177
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,620
to really whatever you want.

178
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,720
I have a sense that they felt they

179
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,900
had to step back away from this because of the pushback.

180
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:39,220
And I think it really still shows the maturity level

181
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,060
within our community sometimes.

182
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,860
Here's where, again, I want to say

183
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,860
I still appreciate that LibreOffice is free software.

184
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,620
It's functional.

185
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,660
It was an option.

186
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,380
There's a lot of elements to this conversation.

187
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,020
But that's the part you just ended on

188
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,300
that I want to touch on here.

189
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,060
I think what ends up happening, and this is just

190
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,980
based on the emails and tweets and telegrams that I get,

191
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,220
is the people that are the most connected

192
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,300
are often the most passionate about free software.

193
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,060
And they respond very quickly.

194
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,540
And they respond very vocally.

195
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,060
I got a lot of people that tweeted me telling me

196
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,980
that they're ripping Manjaro off their system because of this.

197
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,060
People asking on Hacker News for replacement suggestions.

198
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,180
And on our Linux, people were going

199
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:28,180
on about the different ways to migrate to other platforms.

200
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,980
And what happens is that's on day one and day two.

201
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,820
That's like the first 48 hours.

202
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,940
And you really saw a lot go down in the Manjaro forums

203
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,780
in the first 48 hours.

204
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:42,780
What happens around hour 64 and further

205
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:47,860
is I start getting emails from people who are busy.

206
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,980
They have other things to do than to follow

207
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,380
the daily, perhaps even hourly developments

208
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,660
of the Manjaro distribution.

209
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,060
Later in the week, listen to some shows, read some news,

210
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:56,540
whatever.

211
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,060
Exactly.

212
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,580
People downloaded the episode.

213
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,780
They heard the interview.

214
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,540
And then they sent me some feedback.

215
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,220
And as the week went on, and this will continue for weeks.

216
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,140
I mean, people will be emailing me for weeks

217
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,460
because they won't hear this episode.

218
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,500
As the long tail of that feedback gets longer,

219
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,780
more and more the trend line is people

220
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,380
that support the switch to free office

221
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,500
because they're already using it.

222
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,580
And I've gotten things like, yeah, I've

223
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,740
been advocating free office for a while,

224
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,740
and people always jump on me for it.

225
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,820
I'm not trying to defend, again, any decisions made here.

226
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,860
I'm pointing out that the people that are most active

227
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,060
in the initial 48 hours of the conversation

228
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,220
are not representative of the community.

229
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,500
They're representative of a slice

230
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,100
of the most passionate community.

231
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,340
I mean, even just saying you're going to change operating

232
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:43,980
systems, right?

233
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,780
Again, that's a fast thing to do.

234
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,220
You have to care a lot.

235
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,340
Nobody who has a lot of things going on is like,

236
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,180
I'll just reload my OS today.

237
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:56,300
I've got a machine upstairs that is a Frankenstein build

238
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,100
that I need to reload.

239
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,180
And I've been planning to do it for a month.

240
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,300
Because it's working just enough,

241
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,020
I can't get around to it.

242
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,300
I got all these wackadoodle workarounds for it, too.

243
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,060
It's ridiculous.

244
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,820
And my point is that it's not representative

245
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,040
of the full community, but it's the brunt of the feedback

246
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,180
the developers initially get.

247
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,460
And then they want to respond quickly

248
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,780
because they don't want the outrage to escalate.

249
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,020
And so they're really stuck in a catch-22.

250
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,260
And there's a lot of sympathy here, too.

251
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,020
When we talked to Phil, you could

252
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,740
tell he was doing it to try to differentiate Montero.

253
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,460
The thing he spends a lot of time working on,

254
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,660
as do all the people involved in the project.

255
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,980
And this is just a lot of mental stress, right?

256
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,980
When you're like, oh, OK, some people really didn't like that.

257
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:39,060
But you've got to also, from both sides,

258
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,020
community members should talk about what they want

259
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,480
or don't want in their projects.

260
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,340
But you've got to remember that it's not

261
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,300
like they're doing this for some evil agenda.

262
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,620
They're trying to make the thing they work on better.

263
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,500
Brent, I'm going to go to you now.

264
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,740
Because I have to imagine there's

265
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,660
some similarities between what you do

266
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,180
and creative expression in creating

267
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,820
something like a distribution.

268
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,540
It is absolutely a technical undertaking.

269
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,660
But it is also, for these creators, their way

270
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,780
to express their creativity.

271
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,660
And sometimes, the very people you're

272
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,540
making that creative work for have very harsh feedback.

273
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:17,440
And you have to know when to cave and compromise.

274
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,420
And you have to know when to stand your ground.

275
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,260
And I guess the point I'm trying to make to you,

276
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,920
and I'm curious if it resonates with you,

277
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,740
it feels like we're seeing maybe a lot more compromise

278
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,300
these days because of the accessibility

279
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,300
of the developers.

280
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,340
Yeah, this sounds like a little bit of criticism.

281
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,500
But to me, one of the advantages of having

282
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,540
all these distributions is that the developers can create

283
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,460
the product that they want themselves to use

284
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,660
and the options that they themselves want to see.

285
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,320
And I think you've heard from a lot of people

286
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,580
that options is better.

287
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,300
I mean, that was one of our possible choices for titles

288
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,060
last week.

289
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:54,340
And without that sort of creative freedom

290
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:58,060
for the developers and those behind the distributions,

291
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,000
if everyone's feeling pigeonholed

292
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,540
into the same place, we're going to end up with five distributions.

293
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,980
It all tastes the same.

294
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,680
And I don't think that's what we want.

295
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,460
Also, if people can't fully express their creative vision,

296
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,000
I mean, we're getting very meta here.

297
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,060
But if you can't express your creative vision,

298
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,380
you're probably going to burn out.

299
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,460
Yeah, right.

300
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,620
Especially if you're doing something not for money.

301
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,180
Use that joy that comes with creating product

302
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,680
that you're really jazzed about, right?

303
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,500
You're going to end up creating something kind of mediocre

304
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,700
that you're maybe not quite as proud of.

305
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,860
Yeah, exactly right.

306
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,620
And who wants to work on something mediocre?

307
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,500
You want to work on something that gets you up

308
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,140
in the morning.

309
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,420
It does seem like this is sort of an extension of what

310
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,500
we've seen in daily life, right?

311
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,380
Like with the popularity of Twitter and fast feedback

312
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:42,140
cycles and outrage coming before all the facts are in

313
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,540
or can even be sort of sifted through and understood,

314
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,180
maybe took a little while to percolate to our culture

315
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:48,860
as well.

316
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,980
Yeah, I think part of the issue there

317
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:56,140
is you have to put as much responsibility on the people

318
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,540
taking in the outrage and acting on it

319
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:02,180
as the people that are experiencing the outrage.

320
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,980
What I'm trying to say is a new skill now,

321
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,880
when you're managing a large community

322
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,300
or you're building a large software project,

323
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,700
is learning to properly interpret

324
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,940
that volume of feedback in the correct way that

325
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,820
is still good for you and the project and your users.

326
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,100
And so that's why I think there is room for compromise

327
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,020
on some of these issues.

328
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,860
Of course, of course.

329
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,020
And like in this case, this probably

330
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,500
is a net positive for all.

331
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,060
But where do we draw that line?

332
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,100
And I think I could cite three or four just recent examples

333
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,220
of when this has happened, as I did in LAN.

334
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,380
And how do we do this in a way, a more productive way,

335
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,540
so that the Monjaro developers feel comfortable

336
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,620
with the next version of this, right?

337
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,960
Because it doesn't seem like it's going to stop.

338
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,260
No.

339
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,060
Everybody's more connected.

340
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,000
But can't you imagine, then, you have another great idea that

341
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,100
might be a little controversial.

342
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,380
And now you're just like, no, it's not worth it.

343
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,840
I don't want to deal with this again.

344
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,220
Well, and I think that it's part of human nature,

345
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,300
too, that one negative feedback.

346
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,140
And let's say, let's just throw a wild number out there.

347
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:02,300
Let's say they have 250,000 users,

348
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:06,380
and you get 500 people giving you negative feedback,

349
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,820
even less, 50 people, they give you negative feedback.

350
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,540
That's really going to impact your decision on the direction

351
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,820
that you go.

352
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:17,980
And that's not really speaking for the whole user base.

353
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,180
It's that outraged, knee-jerk reaction.

354
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,420
And it's kind of sad.

355
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,300
Yeah, it's challenging.

356
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,740
It is really kind of, I think it's

357
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,100
going to be a larger challenge because of the open nature,

358
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,020
the public nature of this type of development.

359
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,300
Because keep in mind, this wasn't even a finished version

360
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,460
of Monjaro that shipped.

361
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,880
This was something they were going

362
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,140
to do in a release candidate.

363
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,260
Right.

364
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,700
And that wasn't even the final release candidate.

365
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,380
It was just something they were going to try for a cycle.

366
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,940
And if it worked, they'd go with it.

367
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,580
And then it would have been official in the new Monjaro

368
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,220
release.

369
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,700
Or how often do we see little bundles of outrage

370
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,260
from things on mailing lists before any decisions are made?

371
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,980
We're already talking about it.

372
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,460
That was one of the reasons I really

373
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,500
wanted to reach out to Philip.

374
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,540
And things connected, thanks to a friend of the show.

375
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,600
And we were able to get him on here

376
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,700
and get it straight from him.

377
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,060
And I have to give them credit.

378
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,540
I think they came to a compromise that

379
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,980
will make their community happy.

380
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,340
And that's just as important as making good software.

381
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,620
So absolutely.

382
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,980
Congratulations to them.

383
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,820
And hopefully, they build up a little bit more

384
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,780
of a thick skin so the next time something like this comes around.

385
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,940
Because I think that's a good position for Monjaro,

386
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:29,020
to push that edge a little bit, to push it forward a little.

387
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,620
Especially as Endeavor OS comes around,

388
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,800
you can get a pretty vanilla arch experience out of that.

389
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,660
It's nice to see Monjaro kind of go a little more cutting edge,

390
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,700
try things that really differentiate.

391
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,740
Because to their credit and to Pop OS's credit,

392
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,180
they've been getting more and more coverage on YouTube,

393
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,300
which is bringing in more and more people.

394
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,500
And it's funny that those are the first distros.

395
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,100
Like, Monjaro is like, what?

396
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:53,940
OK.

397
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,020
Wouldn't have called that in a predictions episode,

398
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,620
but it seems to be working.

399
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,840
So hopefully, the team continues on.

400
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,060
And the user base is happy with that.

401
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:06,340
As a Fedora user, I'm kind of happy with this new minimization

402
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,420
team that's been announced.

403
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,700
Now, don't get too excited.

404
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,620
It's early days.

405
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,700
But there's a new minimization team forming,

406
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,780
focusing on minimizing the installation

407
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,820
size of a lot of the popular apps, run times,

408
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,820
and other bits of software in Fedora.

409
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,020
Have I got you yet, Wes?

410
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,940
No, that sounds great.

411
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,060
And what I like about this, too, is it's not just

412
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,180
a one-off effort.

413
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,860
The goal is to build an environment where

414
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,660
it's easy for the Fedora maintainers

415
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,380
to keep things small over time.

416
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,880
And so they're going to dig into stuff like Apache and Nginx

417
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,140
and all sorts of various systems all over the operating system,

418
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,300
trying to make them small.

419
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:40,860
That's great.

420
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,620
That could also benefit Santos and RHEL down the road.

421
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,820
Well, this has just got that kind of work

422
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,060
that that's not necessarily fun, it's not necessarily sexy,

423
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,540
but it's going to benefit the whole ecosystem.

424
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,040
Mm-hmm.

425
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,860
Mm-hmm.

426
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,980
Now, Wes, this last story we threw in here,

427
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,700
I think Drew found this.

428
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,060
And I just had Wes Payne all over it.

429
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,580
I always love to give you a hard time

430
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,140
for doing everything with KExec.

431
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:05,820
Sure do.

432
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,500
Wes wants to give a distro a try and creates a RAM disk

433
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,260
and uses KExec, and it goes to town.

434
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,220
And it's hilarious.

435
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,580
It's also very fast.

436
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:16,300
And it looks like some enterprising Google engineers

437
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:21,100
have gotten the Windows kernel to boot via KExec

438
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,260
in a special circumstance, like with, I think,

439
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:27,460
it's early days implementation of the EFI boot services.

440
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,180
Yeah, exactly.

441
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,460
So with KExec and Linux, you can just load the new kernel

442
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,020
and sort of jump to it, hand off control to the new kernel.

443
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:34,540
Blows my mind.

444
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,700
And since they control everything,

445
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,940
you can get that set up so the kernel knows what to do,

446
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,620
and it just starts running, and you've

447
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,580
got a new kernel running.

448
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,300
I just don't understand how it hands off the devices.

449
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,300
Oh, it discovers the devices and stuff.

450
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,500
And the video cards don't crap out and stuff?

451
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,420
You can have some hardware issues, for sure.

452
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,580
But not on your Intel?

453
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,180
No, I haven't had too many issues.

454
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,700
And you can then use stuff like systemD

455
00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:00,020
and try to get the system to the most almost reset state

456
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,260
and then load the new kernel.

457
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,700
There are some amount of things you can do.

458
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,820
But it's already integrated.

459
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,420
You just do systemCTLKExec, and you're off, ready to go.

460
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,500
So here's the thing.

461
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,820
Windows doesn't really boot like that anymore.

462
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,220
Microsoft was really involved in the whole UEFI thing

463
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,140
happening anyway, and they actually use it.

464
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,780
And one of the things that EFI provides is these boot services.

465
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,100
And these are nice little helpers

466
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,460
so you can grab disks and have the firmware

467
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,340
interact before you've got your operating system loaded.

468
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,940
Windows Bootloader definitely takes advantage of those.

469
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,780
And so before, with KExec, you didn't have that,

470
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,900
because you're dumping everything you've got

471
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,260
and you're starting fresh.

472
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,100
This is an implementation, basically,

473
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,300
where as you're KExecing, the kernel

474
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,280
can provide these things to Windows

475
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,320
to get it up and running.

476
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,740
And you can transition to get Windows actually started.

477
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,320
Because the whole thing about exiting the boot services

478
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,700
is once you've got the operating system up and going,

479
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,460
all the boot services code is discarded.

480
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,860
And that way, it could actually still be a clean KExec.

481
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:58,660
So the kernel provides the little bits of UEFI Windows

482
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,060
needs until it can fully handle it.

483
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:00,540
Yes, right.

484
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,820
So you start KExecing.

485
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,360
You get the Windows Bootloader going.

486
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,660
You give it a little EFI stuff.

487
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,860
It calls exit boot services.

488
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,460
All that Linux code is gone, and Windows is off the go.

489
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,260
It's clean Windows.

490
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:09,780
Yep.

491
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,900
Wow.

492
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,820
Another part that was neat about this is,

493
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,420
this was a post up, because Google's

494
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,980
been working on Linux boot, which

495
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:19,820
is a project to replace as much of the EFI stack with Linux

496
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,420
as we can.

497
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,980
So that's where this is going to be useful.

498
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,260
On Twitter, someone else who just that day,

499
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,580
this was like a week or two ago, had

500
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,060
got Windows doing the same thing,

501
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,400
running with a custom kernel module.

502
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,100
So it seems to be multiple parties are interested in that.

503
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,620
And hopefully, that means there's

504
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,100
enough momentum to actually get this polished and merged

505
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,260
somewhere.

506
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:46,020
What I like about this is, when I installed my T480 ThinkPad,

507
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,200
I said to myself, I will never dual boot this machine.

508
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,180
This will always only run Linux.

509
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,380
And I've held true to that.

510
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,460
I have come up with ways to, well, I've

511
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,740
done PCI-paster to get accelerated Windows if I need.

512
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,220
Ironically, I never need it.

513
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,580
But I got it working.

514
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,900
I use it mostly to just accelerate other Linux distros.

515
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,540
But this could be another great way

516
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,460
to have a Linux system with a Windows

517
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,780
install sitting around somewhere on the disk

518
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,500
that you could boot up when you need it

519
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,780
and have full hardware, full performance.

520
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,820
Gosh, this is crazy stuff.

521
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,940
It's also just neat, because this was never really intended.

522
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,780
It's not like Microsoft has blessed this.

523
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,940
It's just some really good hacking in the old school

524
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:25,860
sense.

525
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,780
Well, you know, like they say, most of Azure runs Linux.

526
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,820
So maybe they'll just bite the bullet,

527
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,280
switch everything to Linux, and then

528
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,540
just kegzak into Windows when they need it all to Azure.

529
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,040
Amazing.

530
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,340
Ha ha ha ha.

531
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,740
All right, let's do a little bit of that housekeeping

532
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,660
here on the old show.

533
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,220
We've got a few things to cover.

534
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,500
A local event is just near wrapping up its call

535
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,260
for papers, Seagull 2019.

536
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,300
It is August.

537
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,820
I think your deadline is August 11.

538
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,580
And we're recording on the 6th right now.

539
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,340
Get them in now.

540
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,540
Yeah, so get it in.

541
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,380
Get it in.

542
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,380
And then the Seagull itself runs November 15

543
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,740
through the 16th.

544
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,980
You've done a talk there before.

545
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:06,900
Yeah, two years ago.

546
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,940
It was a really good time.

547
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,420
They were great to the presenters.

548
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,420
So if you want to get involved, super friendly,

549
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,260
accommodating conference.

550
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,060
I know last year they had childcare available.

551
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,020
So they really care about the people coming

552
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,460
to the conference, whether you're presenting

553
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,460
or just want to attend.

554
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,020
And it's just a great spot in downtown Seattle, too.

555
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:23,860
Oh, yeah, beautiful.

556
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,140
If you want an excuse to come visit the city,

557
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,460
I can't think of a better one.

558
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,500
You go down there.

559
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,980
You attend a great event.

560
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,180
And then there's a great evening to be had.

561
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:35,100
I'll also add their CFP page has just some great references.

562
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,820
If you're giving a talk somewhere else,

563
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,740
they've got a ton of good links for how do you

564
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,580
assess what audience you're talking to,

565
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,020
or just some good tips on presentations.

566
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:43,620
Good to know.

567
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,900
Yeah, that is really handy to get you going, isn't it?

568
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,500
Yeah, it is.

569
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,300
Yeah.

570
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:51,600
Also, congratulations to the hard, hardworking individuals

571
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,140
behind the scenes here at Linux Academy

572
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,780
to get the new website launched.

573
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,340
If you haven't seen linuxacademy.com in a little bit,

574
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,620
go check out the new website.

575
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,580
It's looking sharp.

576
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:03,220
I was in some meetings when they were putting this together.

577
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,420
And I'm just going to say, another site's gone dark.

578
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,220
Dark mode for the web.

579
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,500
They did a fantastic job, man.

580
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,620
The product team over there, Alex and Joelle and Ingrid

581
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,140
and all those people over there at Linux Academy,

582
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,160
have been eyeing it and kind of seeing it

583
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,380
as it's being developed.

584
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,620
And the artwork and the new styling

585
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,140
and it's pretty legit, man.

586
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,580
I like it a lot.

587
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,500
They did a great job.

588
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,340
It's the best looking training website ever.

589
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,420
I mean, it's just gorgeous.

590
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,720
They've just done a killer job.

591
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,900
Linuxacademy.com to check that out.

592
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,720
Also, if you haven't checked out the community section

593
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,180
for a while, there's some free stuff over there.

594
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:47,060
And now 180 plus Linux Academy courses have transcripts.

595
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,700
There's more.

596
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,700
It's actually landing all the time.

597
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,020
Another batch lands tomorrow.

598
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,140
Future courses are launching with transcripts.

599
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,740
And they're interactive transcripts.

600
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,240
So you can get time codes and stuff.

601
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,100
You can jump around to that.

602
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,300
We might just have to steal how they did that,

603
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,420
because I want that for our stuff.

604
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:01,980
It's super cool.

605
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:02,980
It's super impressive.

606
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:03,900
I mean, it's a lot of engineering.

607
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,460
And the end result is just great for actually using it

608
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,060
to learn.

609
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,820
Yeah, accessibility and to learn.

610
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,140
I think it's really cool.

611
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,180
And one last thing while we're talking about it,

612
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,560
they're doing some swag giveaways

613
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,420
for the YouTube channel, Linux Academy Com.

614
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,540
If you are a community member or a paid member

615
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,760
or you subscribe to the YouTube channel,

616
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,340
there's a form we'll have linked in the show notes

617
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:26,660
at linuxunplugged.com slash 313 for a swag giveaway,

618
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,260
special, limited edition.

619
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,860
Oh, limited edition.

620
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,180
It's a great team of designers at Linux Academy.

621
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,540
She's just part of, and he's a great designer himself.

622
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,700
But the whole team, like the stuff

623
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,340
they come up with, the website, the art for, the courseware,

624
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,580
and the swag, like the best swag.

625
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,580
Such swag.

626
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,420
I want to know how I get my hands on that swag.

627
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,460
I wonder if they'll make that available to staff.

628
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,420
Can we get an inside deal?

629
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,620
I got some good swag.

630
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,620
So check that out.

631
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,820
Also, the call for paper is coming up soon.

632
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,900
If you're going to be at Seagull, let us know.

633
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,300
Head over to our telegram group,

634
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,460
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash telegram.

635
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,780
Jump in there and let us know if you're going to be at Seagull.

636
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,420
We're trying to get our Seagull game plan together,

637
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,460
and we'd like to hear from you.

638
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,300
Get some JB critical mass.

639
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,260
That could be a thing.

640
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,740
So let's start organizing now to see what we can get together

641
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,940
for November.

642
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,420
All right, so I've been kicking around the Raspberry Pi

643
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,620
4 as a workstation for a week.

644
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,020
That's how it was pitched.

645
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:23,740
So I dropped like 100 and change on the desktop kit.

646
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,540
Not so much overall, really.

647
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:29,140
I mean, really, if you think about what computers used to cost

648
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,780
and what you used to get, this is not bad, really, overall.

649
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,980
The specs of this thing are pretty remarkable

650
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,660
when you compare just like some of my first computers as a kid.

651
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,960
I got the 4 gig RAM edition.

652
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,700
That's what comes in the desktop kit.

653
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,580
It doesn't come with any passive cooling,

654
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,140
and it does come in an enclosure.

655
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,820
And I have pictures of the unboxing of the enclosure.

656
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,140
It's a really nice enclosure.

657
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:51,980
It looks sharp.

658
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,340
The keyboard is nice.

659
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,620
It feels pretty good compared to a lot of smart keyboards.

660
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,080
It's a pretty lightweight keyboard.

661
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,780
It's got a little USB hub built into it, which is very nice.

662
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,940
It also includes in the box the official Raspberry Pi

663
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,020
beginner's guide and everything you

664
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,860
need to get going, including the mouse and the power supply.

665
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,020
I'm kind of curious about that beginner's guide.

666
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,260
Is it walking you through?

667
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,420
Does it have screenshots of the desktop

668
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:19,900
and kind of explaining the system to you?

669
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,620
I'm not sure.

670
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:24,620
Wes will go see if he can find it, because I didn't.

671
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,540
I don't open the manual, cheese.

672
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,860
I think that it's super awesome that they actually

673
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,500
shipped a device with a manual.

674
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,500
You remember actually getting a physical distro

675
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:37,740
that had a 500-page manual in it back in the day?

676
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,900
Love that.

677
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,820
For sure.

678
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,440
So it's a real book.

679
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,580
It's a genuine book.

680
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,780
It feels good in the hands.

681
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,860
Quality paper.

682
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,740
He's got it here, he grabbed it.

683
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,420
So what is it?

684
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,900
Is it a walkthrough of Raspbian?

685
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,300
Yeah, and there's a bunch of projects in here.

686
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,780
I'm seeing some code, and it's got you opening up Chromium

687
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,780
and navigating the desktop, but nicely labeled.

688
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,940
Current screenshots, wow.

689
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,820
Oh, yeah, it was updated for Raspberry Pi 4.

690
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,900
Really, really glossy print, too.

691
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,780
But it's also got some nice prints of the board

692
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,940
to show you where all the ports are and what they do.

693
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,980
This is a really, really good book.

694
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,180
Yeah, that's a really good book.

695
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:12,700
Wow.

696
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,700
It's got stuff for you can get other kits for it.

697
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,780
Here's programming to light up LED board

698
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,380
that you can attach to the Pi.

699
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,700
You know what's funny is I've seen this book,

700
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,660
and I never thought to get it.

701
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,020
And now I'm kind of glad I have it.

702
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:28,060
The Raspberry Pi 4 is, it feels like if you're not

703
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,020
super familiar with the Raspberry Pis,

704
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,940
it looks like a regular Raspberry Pi,

705
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,420
maybe slightly larger.

706
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:38,060
The ethernet and USB ports are switched around.

707
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,980
And the most notable change for me

708
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,640
is the power input is now a USB-C connector.

709
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,620
And gone is the full size HDMI output

710
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,340
replaced with two micro HDMI connectors.

711
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:54,900
Now, the desktop kit does come with two cables

712
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,860
for HDMI in the box, which is nice because I needed that.

713
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:01,800
And it's regular HDMI on one end, micro on the other side.

714
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:06,460
And it is undoubtedly a faster machine.

715
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:12,860
It has a 1.5 gigahertz quad arm V8, a 64-bit processor.

716
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,700
Raspbian ships in 32-bit mode.

717
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,460
The GPU is a Broadcom video core at 500 megahertz.

718
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,340
Mine was a four gigabyte model, but you can also

719
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,300
get it in one or two gigabytes.

720
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,860
Side note, if you don't need the four gigabytes,

721
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,900
you may want to consider the two gigabyte model

722
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,080
because it comes with a passive cooler, I've been told.

723
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,620
It has a gigabit ethernet as well as 2.4 and 5 gigahertz

724
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:38,620
Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0, microSD for the storage.

725
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:42,740
Of course, it's got the classic GPIO 40-pin header.

726
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,540
And it's loaded with USB.

727
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:51,060
It's got two USB 2s and two USB 3s,

728
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,140
as well as full gigabit and Wi-Fi now

729
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,180
because they're actually on their own controllers.

730
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,860
They're not shared on the USB bus.

731
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,140
Pretty much the universal Raspberry Pi complaint.

732
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,860
Yeah, it really changes everything.

733
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:05,060
I mean, it makes everything, it makes this a real production

734
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,620
usable machine.

735
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:11,240
And so I really wanted, I was skeptical.

736
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,860
And I'll say right up front, it's not going to be my desktop.

737
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:21,320
And I have no illusions of replacing an x86 machine

738
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,460
from the last few years with this thing.

739
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:31,740
It, to me, feels like a machine from around 2011, 2010

740
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,700
with a decent processor, four gigs of RAM,

741
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,300
and a spinning hard drive.

742
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,900
And I was using SD storage.

743
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:41,980
So as they begin to support booting from USB storage,

744
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:44,180
I'll try again with a USB 3 SSD.

745
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,220
I bet it would be better.

746
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,420
I'm sure it would be.

747
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:50,740
But the overall desktop, for me, kind of meh.

748
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,820
I could see it definitely working anywhere

749
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,100
where a computer that takes a little while to open up

750
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,340
your web browser, sometimes it takes a while for the next tab

751
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,700
to open, it feels like a spinning rust machine.

752
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,620
Anywhere where that workload is acceptable,

753
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,300
you may get away with a Raspberry Pi.

754
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,180
For most of the history of mankind's computing,

755
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:09,820
totally usable if you're a desktop power user,

756
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,740
you're going to hate it.

757
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,620
Yeah.

758
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:15,300
So I did some thorough benchmarking on this thing.

759
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:15,820
Oh, boy.

760
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,140
I love the Ferronix test suite.

761
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,620
Talked about it many times on this show before.

762
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,980
And you combine that with the Open Benchmark website,

763
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:26,340
you can compare your system to any system that's

764
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,980
ever submitted their benchmarks to the Open Benchmark website.

765
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,700
It's so cool.

766
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,060
So I could compare this Raspberry Pi for,

767
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,860
I went to machines as far back as 2011.

768
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:38,020
And I was able to get a whole range of machines

769
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,500
that I could compare this thing to.

770
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,140
And as long as they performed the same types of tests

771
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,020
that I did.

772
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:47,460
And we did CPU performance, we did memory performance tests,

773
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,060
we did audio encoding tests.

774
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,620
I attempted to do video encoding,

775
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:54,140
but that test failed on the Raspberry Pi 4.

776
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:57,380
So I decided to try to find where this machine sort of fits

777
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,720
when compared to an x86 machine.

778
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,780
If you could buy an x86 machine, how much

779
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,660
would you have to spend to have comparable performance

780
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,020
to a Raspberry Pi 4?

781
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,420
I thought that'd be kind of interesting.

782
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:10,300
Kind of the reverse here, you're trying to optimize low.

783
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,140
Can we find a cheap x86 that?

784
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,500
Yeah, how much would that cost?

785
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,700
I know it's kind of a backwards way to think about it.

786
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:20,420
But when you get a Raspberry Pi with this kind of performance,

787
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,900
it gets to this awkward middle ground

788
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:27,420
where it's a little bit faster than an older x86 machine

789
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:30,460
at some operations and slower at others.

790
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,260
And it's kind of like, is this a job now for a Raspberry Pi,

791
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:36,420
or is this a job for a NUC, a used NUC or something?

792
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,980
We're getting in that range.

793
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:42,280
And so I compared this to an Intel Core 2 Quad.

794
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,700
And I know that seems a little odd,

795
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:48,380
but that's actually, this is a 2011 system

796
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:52,780
that has a 2.4 gigahertz, four cores, and four gigabytes

797
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,940
of RAM.

798
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,340
And what these tests will show, and they're all

799
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,380
linked in the show notes.

800
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,540
And by the way, if you're curious how your Raspberry

801
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:03,420
Pi stacks up or your own desktop or laptop,

802
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,460
one of the great things about the Phronics test suite

803
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,500
is you can use my URL I have in the show notes,

804
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,880
and you can compare your system.

805
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,900
It'll run the exact same tests, and then

806
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,900
it'll generate those bars you've seen on the Phronics websites.

807
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,700
It'll generate those charts to show you

808
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,820
how your machine differs from my machine.

809
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,220
That's all linked in the show notes

810
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,740
if you'd like to compare how your system would perform.

811
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:26,780
What was interesting is when it came to a lot of CPU tests,

812
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:35,140
the Raspberry Pi 4 would lag behind a moderate 2011 Intel

813
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:35,780
system.

814
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:39,620
I compared it to quad cores and dual core systems.

815
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,980
And in almost all CPU-bound tasks,

816
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:46,980
the Raspberry Pi 4 was notably slower.

817
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,460
Right, not out of this world, not

818
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,860
a different order of magnitude, but noticeably slower.

819
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:53,460
Generally, like in a lot of the audio encoding tasks,

820
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,460
it was 10 seconds slower than some of these Intel systems.

821
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,500
But in aggregate, that adds up.

822
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,420
Which kind of adds up, right?

823
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,700
And it kind of makes sense with the other things we've seen.

824
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,380
Totally usable.

825
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,460
You could do those things there, but if you do them

826
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,140
all the time, it's going to be painful.

827
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,580
Where it surprised me and pulled ahead,

828
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,300
and not too surprising when you consider

829
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,380
the age of these systems, is operations

830
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:16,540
that were more memory-bound, memory performance tests,

831
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:19,180
the Raspberry Pi 4 often performed much better.

832
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:22,340
Not at all tasks, but often, on the average,

833
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,740
performed better than the Intel systems.

834
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,700
So if you're doing things in memory

835
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:30,300
on an embedded system, a Raspberry Pi, in this case,

836
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,660
would actually be potentially a faster system

837
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,740
than an old, used Intel box you have laying around the house.

838
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:39,700
And it's, without a question, using way less power,

839
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,740
and likely making a lot less noise, too.

840
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,940
And I mean, that makes sense, too,

841
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,580
unless you're doing serious crunching and work on your Pi.

842
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,340
Probably a lot of times, you have other devices attached

843
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,900
to it, and you just need those CPUs to shuffle bits around.

844
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,740
Yeah, which we'll talk about here in just a second.

845
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,860
So the question of, how much would you have to spend

846
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:58,420
on an x86 machine to beat the Raspberry Pi in performance?

847
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:01,220
If you're willing to go used, and I think, in this case,

848
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:04,700
you should, we have a link to an example PC

849
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,820
at PCLiquidators.com.

850
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:12,060
$54.99 gets you an Intel Core 2 Duo at 2.93 gigahertz,

851
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:15,460
4 gigs of RAM, and a 250 gigabyte hard drive.

852
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,100
And this system, based on the systems

853
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,180
I was able to compare it to on the Ferronix Open Benchmark

854
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:24,260
website, would perform faster than a Raspberry Pi 4.

855
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,780
So a $54 used x86.

856
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,500
It's louder.

857
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,420
It's going to put out more heat.

858
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,780
It's going to use more power.

859
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,580
There's not as big of a community around it.

860
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,460
There's lots of other downsides.

861
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:40,060
But just as a reference point now,

862
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:43,380
we're starting to get around a 2011 kind of performance,

863
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:47,620
a little bit maybe 2010 performance of an x86 desktop

864
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:51,020
on a $35, $45 computer.

865
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:55,340
Yeah, that has modern Wi-Fi, and modern ports, and a huge

866
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,340
community, and lots of little gadgets, and dongles,

867
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,620
and accessories for it, too.

868
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:03,340
So my walk away from my week with the Raspberry Pi

869
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:06,380
as a desktop is I probably won't continue to really use it

870
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,620
as a desktop for me.

871
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,740
I could definitely see myself, like if I wanted a workbench

872
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:14,900
computer that I could look stuff up, have a terminal,

873
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,140
do some quick Google searches, 100%.

874
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,380
Yeah, just as a computer to leave around somewhere extra

875
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:19,980
just in case.

876
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,460
Great.

877
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,940
I mean, with the desktop kit, you've got everything you need.

878
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,000
You've got absolutely everything you need except for a screen.

879
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,580
And I've got screens floating around.

880
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,900
I bet everyone does.

881
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,140
So I could totally, absolutely see myself

882
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,500
using it in that scenario.

883
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,300
But where I really see myself putting it in production now

884
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:38,500
is more like a component of a wider home system

885
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:42,620
now with the networking options, and now the faster storage

886
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,740
options, and the faster CPU.

887
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:48,540
This thing can do real image processing for me.

888
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,500
It can do some real actual tasks.

889
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,960
And I want to recommend that people

890
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,600
take a look at the Flick case.

891
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,580
I think the Flirrk case.

892
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,420
I bought them before.

893
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:59,580
They now have one in production for the Raspberry Pi 4.

894
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,820
We'll link to some information.

895
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:04,060
It shows genuine reductions in the thermals for the Raspberry

896
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,420
Pi 4 using this case.

897
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,820
So something you want to consider

898
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:09,260
if you're going to put this thing in long-term production.

899
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,660
Also, if you look on Thingiverse,

900
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,500
you'll see a community building up around now

901
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:19,020
the new Raspberry Pi 4, including a wicked awesome NAS

902
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:22,300
enclosure that Alex found that accommodates

903
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,700
a top slot for the Raspberry Pi 4.

904
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,740
And then underneath it is room for SATA drives,

905
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,820
like large drives.

906
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,340
And they have different sizes.

907
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,740
They have some where you can print with the NextCloud logo

908
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,260
on the side.

909
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:40,700
It's a DIY NAS enclosure for the Raspberry Pi 4

910
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,860
that has some cross-ventilation on it.

911
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:45,460
And people are starting to design cases already

912
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,700
to accommodate its higher heat profile.

913
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:52,540
My problem with the Raspberry Pi 4 is I have a 3B+.

914
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:55,180
And I use it to do octo print for my 3D printer.

915
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,100
It's wonderful for that.

916
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,940
But my issue with the Raspberry Pi 4

917
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:01,940
is that by the time you buy the 4 gigabyte model,

918
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:05,260
you buy a keyboard, a mouse, and all the rest of it.

919
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:08,780
With this desktop kit, you're looking at, what, $120 US?

920
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,320
If you get the desktop kit.

921
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:15,500
I just built an x86 system to run PFSense around an i5

922
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,260
third gen.

923
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:21,060
So I think it was a 3470T or something, low power.

924
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:24,460
Pulls about 10, maybe 12 watts from the wall.

925
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:27,060
Has significantly better performance, of course,

926
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,900
than a Pi 4.

927
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,380
And that cost me $100 US.

928
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,900
This puts, for me, the Raspberry Pi

929
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,060
in a really awkward situation.

930
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,420
Yes, you've got the network effect, the community,

931
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,380
the people on Thingiverse, all the rest of it.

932
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:43,860
But without some kind of way to remove the SD boot situation,

933
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:46,180
because that really hurts performance of apt update,

934
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,660
et cetera.

935
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,220
It's just in a really awkward spot

936
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:52,500
now it costs in that $100 price point.

937
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,660
I think it still has some significant advantages.

938
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,700
I wouldn't underplay the community effect.

939
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,160
There's so many images available,

940
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,180
especially for some of the stuff we're

941
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,700
going to talk about here in a moment.

942
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,820
You just pop it on, it's good to go.

943
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,660
That makes it approachable to a lot of people.

944
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,220
Yeah, I think it is, you're right,

945
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,900
in an awkward spot of if you just need a box that you're

946
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,060
already experienced, you don't mind

947
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,140
playing around on the Linux command line maybe,

948
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,860
then yeah, there's a lot of options there.

949
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:17,100
But if you do maybe want a project for someone,

950
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,260
or you might not want a FUTZ, and you

951
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,860
do want to treat it very appliance,

952
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:21,980
the Pi is kind of unique.

953
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:27,380
But this, Alex, was the central struggle of my review.

954
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:30,340
Before the show started, I was not looking forward to this

955
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:34,340
at all, because I bought the Raspberry Pi 4 thinking,

956
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,380
finally this will be the Raspberry Pi for me

957
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:39,380
that's fast enough, it's got enough RAM,

958
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,620
now I can really use this sucker.

959
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:45,060
And I ended up kind of thinking exactly what you're thinking.

960
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,660
Boy, in most cases, I could use some NUCs

961
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,380
that I have in the studio that I didn't want

962
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,140
to use in production anymore.

963
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,460
And for the other stuff, I could probably

964
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:57,740
just use VMs, which would also be a little bit faster.

965
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:00,500
And I don't really know where the Raspberry Pi fits anymore.

966
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,580
It was exactly the opposite of my expectations.

967
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,680
My expectations were, this would finally

968
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,700
make it the perfect fit.

969
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,220
And instead, I'm even more lost.

970
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,840
And so what Wes and I had to do was

971
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,260
we spent the last two days putting our heads together,

972
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:15,960
coming up with various different uses that really are

973
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,220
perfect for the Raspberry Pi, like jobs that are

974
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,260
great for the Raspberry Pi.

975
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:22,140
And we've been slamming it into various different use cases.

976
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,340
And we've landed on one that I think I like a lot,

977
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:27,740
that I would never use an x86 PC for.

978
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,860
So that, you know, but I'm with you.

979
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,140
The Raspberry Pi 4 muddies that question more

980
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,180
than it answers it.

981
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:36,940
So back in 2012, I used it as a Raspberry MC box

982
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,620
way before LibreELEC and all the rest of it.

983
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:42,740
And it had pretty decent performance

984
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:46,420
and was able to, for the price of $35,

985
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:49,220
outperform anything in its price point.

986
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:54,500
But now we have this huge market of small system boards

987
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,180
like the Pi.

988
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:59,540
Cheese has a whole collection, I think.

989
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:02,840
And what the Raspberry Pi 1 did was

990
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,980
it showed that there was a market for that sort of sub $50

991
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:08,180
single board computer.

992
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:12,060
And whether the Pi 4 has knocked it out the park,

993
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,860
I think, is questionable, simply because they've

994
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,180
given you that option to go to the 4 gig.

995
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:20,260
So I'm now evaluating it as a $55 device

996
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,140
rather than a $35 device.

997
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,580
And that really changes the game somewhat.

998
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:27,700
I agree, only in so much that I think only us geeks kind of

999
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,440
care about that.

1000
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,980
I think the general public, you know,

1001
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:34,260
a dad and a kid or a mom and a daughter or a teacher

1002
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,860
in a class or whatever the scenario is where they,

1003
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,840
you know, it's people that are not inherently

1004
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,500
familiar with the options.

1005
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,340
They need something that they recognize,

1006
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,140
something they can order on Amazon.

1007
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,060
And the Raspberry Pi really fits that.

1008
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:48,660
But only us geeks care about it anyway, don't we?

1009
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:48,900
I don't know.

1010
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,020
I think the Raspberry Pi is one of those things that,

1011
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,180
like I say, it's in schools.

1012
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,580
It's a good teaching thing.

1013
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,940
I mean, it was originally really all about learning Python.

1014
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:58,660
And I think that those are roots have given it success

1015
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,100
in some of those communities.

1016
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,500
So Cheesy, you understand the struggle, too,

1017
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,860
because you and I were talking about this.

1018
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:05,700
And I know you've been working on kind of a neat implementation

1019
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,580
for your Raspberry Pi.

1020
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:09,500
So why don't you kick us off with some actual practical

1021
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,820
uses for this thing that's getting crazy fast.

1022
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,780
And really, even the older Raspberry Pis

1023
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,460
were fast enough to do some of this stuff.

1024
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,900
Yeah, so I mean, I've been using the Raspberry Pi, man,

1025
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:21,220
since the OG B model.

1026
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:24,120
But there are still some really great uses.

1027
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,260
And one that I came across recently

1028
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:31,580
was Shinobi, which is basically just a network video recorder.

1029
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:37,740
The ZoneMinder, where ZoneMinder kind of ended,

1030
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:41,980
Shinobi has kind of picked up and taken off from them.

1031
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:47,900
So it's Node.js, super nice, super simple to install.

1032
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:52,700
Right now, I have it hooked up to a FozCam that's just

1033
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,580
running the RTSP stream.

1034
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:58,620
I'm sitting, and this is on the 3,

1035
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:06,620
I'm sitting at 3% CPU usage, about 250 megs of RAM.

1036
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:09,340
And I've been recording kind of clips throughout the day.

1037
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,780
And I've used like 300 megabytes of storage.

1038
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:17,840
You can also add additional devices easily into Shinobi.

1039
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,380
So if you have additional cameras,

1040
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,460
there's so many settings.

1041
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,900
I haven't had an opportunity to dive in and deep dive

1042
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,900
into every little setting yet.

1043
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,700
But there's a ton of different stuff in there.

1044
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:31,220
The only thing that I haven't found,

1045
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,760
that I'm sure some other solutions,

1046
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,580
because I know there are some other NVR and surveillance

1047
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:41,180
camera solutions for the Pi, I haven't found the plug-in

1048
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:45,660
to allow me to do motion detection yet.

1049
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,980
Granted, I've only been messing it for maybe an hour

1050
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,340
and a half, two hours.

1051
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:51,560
Let me take over from here then, my friend.

1052
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:56,020
So we've been messing around with something a bit similar.

1053
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:59,180
You can go deep, or you can go light.

1054
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,940
And we kind of went kind of light and thin

1055
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,980
with our implementation.

1056
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,580
So we actually just did something

1057
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:07,220
on top of the Raspbian image that came on the SD card.

1058
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:10,460
So this is pretty low barrier to entry.

1059
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:13,740
And then we integrated it with a wider automation system.

1060
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:17,060
And this little task that we ended up doing,

1061
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,620
and I finally got around to trying,

1062
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:22,220
because I had a reason to with the Raspberry Pi 4,

1063
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:29,220
has opened my mind to an amazing world of possibilities

1064
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,380
and fun geeky projects that could

1065
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,580
keep me busy for a year flat.

1066
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,580
Yeah, that's sincere.

1067
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,040
He's actually legitimately excited.

1068
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,140
I'm so happy about this.

1069
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:42,980
I mean, you could make an entire show out of this stuff.

1070
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,640
It's so good.

1071
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,200
So Wes, why don't we start at the beginning?

1072
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:52,340
We're using a Raspberry Pi with a Logitech webcam,

1073
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:55,100
just something you bought off of Amazon.

1074
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,920
This one's a C930, because we have a few of those

1075
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,220
around the studio, plugged into the USB 2

1076
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,800
port on the Raspberry Pi 4.

1077
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,460
And then we're running some open source software

1078
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,020
to do a little bit of image magic.

1079
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:06,980
Oh, yeah.

1080
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,820
And you found it originally, funny enough,

1081
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,980
as, of course, a bespoke distribution for the Pi

1082
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:14,540
called Motion IOS.

1083
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:18,260
But as is true, with the Pi 4 being relatively new,

1084
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,820
it didn't have an updated image yet.

1085
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,460
But it has great support just right in there.

1086
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,060
It turns out most of the packages we need

1087
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,620
were already in Raspbian.

1088
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,680
So all I had to do was get it installed,

1089
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,860
which turned out to be fascinatingly simple.

1090
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,820
So it's just the package that you want.

1091
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,060
It's just called Motion, is that what it's called?

1092
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:33,980
So there's multiple components.

1093
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:34,480
Yeah.

1094
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,060
So Motion is the back end system that

1095
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:40,220
can talk to all the cameras, configure them, add them,

1096
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,220
and then actually watch them for motion.

1097
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:45,500
And then we're using a project on top called Motion I, which

1098
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,860
provides us a slick little GUI in the web

1099
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,020
that you can then go configure motion in the back end

1100
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:52,180
and just watch all your streams.

1101
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,340
Yeah, it gives you a place to aggregate the cameras.

1102
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,340
So you can have a heads up if you had a bunch of cameras.

1103
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,460
You can have them all on there.

1104
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:59,180
You can tweak all of the camera settings,

1105
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:02,420
like the res and the refresh rates and the frame rates.

1106
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:08,420
But this web interface also lets you set up a little web hook.

1107
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,060
Yeah, it's exactly what you might

1108
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:12,000
want as a nerdy customizer, because you

1109
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,140
can run a custom command.

1110
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:15,300
You can send an HTTP request with a web hook,

1111
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,540
like whatever you need.

1112
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:19,420
So now we've got that tied back into the Home Assistant we just

1113
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:20,860
got set up at the studio.

1114
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:24,180
Now Motion, as the name implies, is

1115
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:27,820
watching a camera feed for motion,

1116
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,660
and then it is triggering an event when

1117
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:31,300
it's detected in that frame.

1118
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:34,820
It's then essentially notifying our Home Assistant install

1119
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,300
that an event has happened.

1120
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,900
And then what are we doing after Home Assistant becomes aware

1121
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,180
that Motion's been detected?

1122
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,680
Well, then you can do whatever you want.

1123
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,820
Home Assistant's got some neat automation support, right?

1124
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:45,940
So you can have it trigger off a state of something

1125
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:49,260
attached on your network, or it has its own web hook provider.

1126
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,140
So once the web comes in, you can then

1127
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:52,620
interact with anything else you want.

1128
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:54,460
In our case, we're just having it turn off and on the light

1129
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:55,380
when we enter a room.

1130
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,300
But that was just a test case.

1131
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:02,460
Yeah, we just quickly just grabbed a random old Wemo

1132
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:05,380
smart plug that hadn't been used in probably two years

1133
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,060
and plugged it in, got it updated.

1134
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:08,420
Home Assistant detected it.

1135
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:11,420
Wes got it working after getting a manual Wemo integration

1136
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:13,260
set up, which didn't take him too long.

1137
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,840
And then it was just a device that you

1138
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,580
could include in your overall actions

1139
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:17,340
when something happens.

1140
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:17,580
Yeah.

1141
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,620
I've only been using this just in the past couple of days.

1142
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:22,300
But it is nice in that you can support just regular old

1143
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:25,980
devices that are supported on Linux, plugged in over USB.

1144
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:29,020
Or you can do stuff like RTMP or RTSP.

1145
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:31,820
And if maybe you're not an expert with those things,

1146
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:35,260
if you're running MotionEye on multiple systems,

1147
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:36,100
you can interconnect.

1148
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:38,460
It basically exposes that video as a stream outside, too.

1149
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:40,700
So you can connect them all together however you need.

1150
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:43,020
And here's where it gets pretty neat.

1151
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,500
So it gives you a lot of options.

1152
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,460
First of all, it's clear how you could use this

1153
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:48,740
in a security scenario.

1154
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:50,120
Sure.

1155
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,660
It's also nice from a safety scenario.

1156
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,820
You have lights turn on when you enter a room.

1157
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:57,620
But what I'm ultimately going for is presence awareness.

1158
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:59,820
And I want multiple levels of presence awareness.

1159
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:02,600
I want motion detectors to know when I'm in a certain room.

1160
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,500
I want a location service that notifies Home Assistant.

1161
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,740
I want Home Assistant to be communicating with my garage

1162
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:10,300
door so when the garage door at the studio is opened.

1163
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:11,720
All these are different data points

1164
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,300
that I can use to automate things.

1165
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:16,780
But you can also use a system like this

1166
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:21,700
in a really relatively low-fi, low-key sort of security

1167
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:22,860
implementation.

1168
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:27,820
So the use case for us is I have a property with a barn on it.

1169
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:28,660
It's family property.

1170
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:31,420
And often when I'm traveling, we like to keep an eye on it.

1171
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:33,900
And I could deploy these Raspberry Pis.

1172
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:36,140
In this case, I only need to monitor two spots.

1173
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:39,700
So one spot, I could physically place the Raspberry Pi

1174
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,220
and put a camera on a door.

1175
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,340
And if motion's detected, it can alert me.

1176
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,820
And there's another spot that's about, well,

1177
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:47,540
it's really on the other side of the barn.

1178
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:50,380
So it's a distance where I could put a network camera that

1179
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:54,980
could feed Motion Eye over RTSP.

1180
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:56,860
Because it can take in video for Linux.

1181
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:59,740
It can take in the Pi camera module itself.

1182
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:02,740
Or it can take in an RTSP stream.

1183
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,780
And so that's a lot of different cameras.

1184
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:06,420
You could all of a sudden pull into this thing

1185
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:07,700
and start watching for motion.

1186
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:10,940
And so with a relatively small setup, one Raspberry Pi 4,

1187
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:14,380
and I take my Ting MiFi and have this thing sitting there.

1188
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:17,140
So if I need to access it or it needs to send me an alert,

1189
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:17,980
it has internet.

1190
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,780
But because everything would be on the Pi,

1191
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,860
it wouldn't be using the internet otherwise.

1192
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:23,420
There's no cloud connectivity.

1193
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:25,380
And it can do some of those other similar things.

1194
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:26,940
You can have it export a movie, say,

1195
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:29,660
of an x amount of time around when the motion was detected.

1196
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:31,820
It can send you an email when it does detect motion.

1197
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:33,620
So I can get the picture sent to me.

1198
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:34,580
Yeah, you can get a still picture.

1199
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:36,700
So it's a great way to keep an eye on things

1200
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:39,340
at the barn for a pretty low price.

1201
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:40,540
I've already got the cameras.

1202
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:44,020
It's a webcam and an old, crappy, wireless camera

1203
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:45,900
from like 10 years ago.

1204
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,660
But you know, it's good enough to detect motion.

1205
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:49,740
And it pivots.

1206
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:50,460
It moves around.

1207
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:53,260
So it's actually kind of a perfect use for this.

1208
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:55,300
And I'm not using it for anything else.

1209
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,740
So I actually think this would be a great use for it.

1210
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:00,340
And I wouldn't want to put an x86 PC in a barn

1211
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:01,380
that I'm not at.

1212
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,620
But there's a perfect shelf that has a power plug there

1213
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:04,940
that I can put this on.

1214
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:06,980
I have a Ting MiFi that I'm not using right now

1215
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:08,340
that I'll just set right next to it.

1216
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:09,880
So it always has internet connectivity

1217
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,300
whether I'm there or not.

1218
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,420
Nice to have a little box too, right?

1219
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:15,340
You can SSH in there if you need to for some reason.

1220
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:15,940
Some here.

1221
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:17,260
It's like you're there.

1222
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:21,180
Does motion allow you to stream multiple cameras at once?

1223
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:27,380
And does motion also allow you to have multiple accounts

1224
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:30,740
creation so that you can, let's say, group cameras

1225
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:34,060
or restrict cameras to user level access?

1226
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:38,180
So let's say if I wanted my mom to have access

1227
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:41,460
to my outdoor cameras but not the indoor cameras,

1228
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:43,340
I could set up an account within Shinobi

1229
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:49,020
to only limit her to see these specific cameras.

1230
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:53,780
And she could even add in her own cameras with her own link.

1231
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:57,220
This is a second recommendation for Shinobi from me.

1232
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:00,460
And a little bit of secret information.

1233
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:04,100
Linux server will be releasing a Docker of Shinobi pretty soon.

1234
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:04,660
That's great.

1235
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:05,820
That's great.

1236
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:09,420
Yeah, so the MotionEye web software

1237
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:11,080
will allow you to add multiple cameras.

1238
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,540
Does it do users though, Wes?

1239
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:13,380
It has some users.

1240
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:14,380
I've not played with that yet.

1241
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:15,380
So it might be something to look into.

1242
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:17,140
I kind of wonder if, see, I think

1243
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:19,180
we have two different use cases here, really.

1244
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:21,020
Because motion for us, the primary use case

1245
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:24,140
we're trying to get out of it is motion detection in a video

1246
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:26,340
to then trigger automation events.

1247
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:29,820
I think if you're looking for actual surveillance footage.

1248
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:32,460
More CCTV stuff, Shinobi seems like it's just great.

1249
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:33,460
Right.

1250
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:34,740
I'm not really going for that.

1251
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,580
I'm not going to be reviewing the footage.

1252
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,260
I don't want to watch people.

1253
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:42,780
I just want to use webcams that I have as a motion sensor

1254
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:44,380
to trigger further automation.

1255
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,580
So that's why it's nice for me.

1256
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:48,020
I'm pretty sure that Shinobi can also

1257
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:52,060
do that, where you can tie into it, like the, what is it,

1258
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:53,700
the IFTT or whatever.

1259
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,320
Yeah, they may have like a webhook thing.

1260
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,220
That'd be awesome.

1261
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:57,700
If there was only a container of it

1262
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,300
that I could try out right now.

1263
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,060
Oh, jeez.

1264
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:01,660
Well, there is.

1265
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:02,820
Shinobi might one as well.

1266
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:06,220
But Linux serve, obviously, the permissions thing.

1267
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:07,300
And we might give it a go.

1268
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:08,540
You know, it wouldn't be bad.

1269
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:11,420
It wouldn't be bad to have both, right?

1270
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:12,860
I think the nice thing about motion

1271
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:14,660
that I liked a lot about it was that it was just

1272
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,260
a really quick install from the repos,

1273
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:17,500
and now we have motion detection.

1274
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,860
Yeah, like looking at some of the Shinobi docs,

1275
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:21,100
it seems like just fine there is motion detection,

1276
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:22,620
but there's a little more going on.

1277
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:25,060
And probably this isn't the best or most sophisticated motion

1278
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:25,740
detection, but you're right.

1279
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:28,220
It kind of hit the sweet spot of installed it straight

1280
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:30,340
from the repo, not a lot of dependencies.

1281
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,220
And I mean, it's worked for us so far.

1282
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,500
And you can throw it on a Raspberry Pi.

1283
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:36,380
I mean, we have a stack of Raspberry Pis around here.

1284
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:37,700
The Pi 4 is doing great.

1285
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,860
I'm watching a 30 FPS video.

1286
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:41,980
It's streaming right now from the camera, no problem.

1287
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:42,740
That's what I'm saying.

1288
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:44,180
It's like the Pi 4 has the horsepower

1289
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:45,620
now to do some of this camera stuff

1290
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:48,500
and really keep up with the networking too, which is nice.

1291
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,840
Have you considered doing something like a Kubernetes

1292
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,980
cluster with them?

1293
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:55,540
I mean, have I considered it?

1294
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:56,060
No.

1295
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:58,060
Am I aware that people are maniacs like that?

1296
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:00,340
Yes, I am aware.

1297
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:02,620
I mean, I guess if you had a whole bunch of Pi apps

1298
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:03,860
you wanted to run, why not?

1299
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:05,820
Well, it's a great educational opportunity too.

1300
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:07,700
It is just great for that.

1301
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:09,540
So yeah, so there are a couple of things

1302
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,340
you need to know if you're thinking about buying one.

1303
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:13,180
Because I know some people are waiting for them

1304
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:15,460
to be more generally available.

1305
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:17,860
As you heard us mention, USB boot doesn't work yet.

1306
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:19,580
Also, Pixie boot does not work.

1307
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:20,700
They say that's coming.

1308
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:21,460
Oh, nice.

1309
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:25,620
Some USB-C chargers don't work, specifically the smarter ones.

1310
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:27,380
So watch out for that.

1311
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:30,540
Just for now, get an official one.

1312
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:34,260
And in general, it's more prone to throttling.

1313
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:38,420
Ours, the desktop kit, comes in a plastic case.

1314
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:40,540
And when I started benchmarking it the first day,

1315
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:44,420
it made the entire room stink of plastic.

1316
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:47,100
Because it had heated up the plastic molding.

1317
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:51,060
And as the plastic heated, it released that chemical smell.

1318
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:55,940
And even today, a week later, when I open up the Raspberry

1319
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:57,460
Pi to see if it had a cooler or not,

1320
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:59,860
because I couldn't remember, which it does not,

1321
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:02,020
I got a big face full of that plastic smell.

1322
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:03,580
It's running hot.

1323
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:06,580
And around four minutes of it running out full blast,

1324
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:09,020
it starts throttling pretty noticeably.

1325
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:11,460
That said, if you're browsing the web,

1326
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:13,860
you're doing stuff like bursty here and there,

1327
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:15,260
you generally don't even see it.

1328
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:16,340
It's not a huge deal.

1329
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,060
You throw a proper cooler on that thing,

1330
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:20,140
you'll get even more mileage out of it.

1331
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:24,500
And the 4 gig RAM edition is very hard to get your hands on.

1332
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,860
The 2 gig and 1 gig are much more readily available right

1333
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:27,500
now.

1334
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,180
Keep in mind, when Raspbian ships on it,

1335
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:32,560
it's shipping in 32-bit, even though it's a 64-bit processor.

1336
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,260
You only got 4 gigs of RAM anyways, though,

1337
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:35,980
so it doesn't really matter.

1338
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:39,980
Overall, I think it is probably my favorite Raspberry Pi.

1339
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:42,220
And I asked the audience what they're using theirs for.

1340
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:45,340
Seth says that these days, he uses one as a print server

1341
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:47,700
for his i3D printer.

1342
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,140
He uses Octopi.

1343
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:52,340
And I think I've heard a few people say they use it for that.

1344
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:56,060
Lenny says he uses his Raspberry Pi as a transmission server.

1345
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:57,140
Oh, nice.

1346
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:58,420
This is a good use for that.

1347
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:01,940
Of course, several people wrote in and said they use Kodi.

1348
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:03,020
They use it for Kodi.

1349
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:04,220
Absolutely.

1350
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:06,020
Which was my first go-to, but I was like,

1351
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:08,220
no, I want to come up with something that's not Kodi.

1352
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:10,340
Because that's like everybody expects that.

1353
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:11,820
I thought this one was interesting.

1354
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:14,740
Salton says he uses it as a co-turn server.

1355
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:18,060
And he's planning to set up also to use it as a NextCloud Talk

1356
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:19,140
server in the future.

1357
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:22,220
And he uses his other Raspberry Pi as a Kodi box.

1358
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:23,100
Excellent.

1359
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,820
I'm sure it runs PyHole just great, too.

1360
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:26,380
Yeah, lots of PyHoles came in.

1361
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:29,300
And then Lewis said Cheesy uses it

1362
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:33,540
as an SSH server, which he then hops to the other boxes.

1363
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:35,780
Also, the other one is a Plex server.

1364
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:39,580
And another one, dang, as NextCloud NAS.

1365
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:43,060
And to your point, Alex, planning

1366
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:46,780
to eventually set up a four-node Kubernetes Pi cluster.

1367
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:47,340
Beautiful.

1368
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:47,840
Nice.

1369
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,180
And you can't forget the PyHole either, you know?

1370
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:51,580
No, you've got to have the PyHole.

1371
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:52,460
We've talked about that.

1372
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,500
The only reason I didn't bring it up

1373
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,180
is because we did a whole episode on it.

1374
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:56,900
So that's in the back catalog.

1375
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:58,340
But worth checking out if you don't

1376
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:00,100
know what we're talking about.

1377
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:02,460
That's also a very good use for the Raspberry Pi.

1378
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:06,180
So check out my links when we're in the benchmark sections

1379
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:06,940
of the show notes.

1380
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:10,580
Because that's where you can get my particular tests

1381
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:11,700
that you can compare.

1382
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:14,400
One of the really, really neat things about the Open Benchmark

1383
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:18,940
website is they have a big old identifier hash

1384
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:21,040
at the end of the URL.

1385
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:25,960
You can copy that and do a comma and append it to another one.

1386
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:29,100
And you can compare any system that way.

1387
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:31,860
And you can add another comma and compare another one.

1388
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:34,020
And the website will generate the charts and graphs

1389
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:36,140
to show you all the different systems.

1390
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:37,540
So it's really nice.

1391
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:39,380
If you've done some benchmarks in the past,

1392
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:41,420
you can just go grab my test ID and my identifier

1393
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:42,940
and then just add a comma, paste it in there,

1394
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:45,700
compare it to yours, see if it's worth an upgrade.

1395
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:48,060
You can just see it right there.

1396
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:50,220
And it's funny because I have my own.

1397
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:52,060
I compared it to some of my old systems

1398
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:54,420
that we've had in for review over the years that

1399
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:56,860
are up on Open Benchmark, just to kind of see where it was.

1400
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:57,380
That's fantastic.

1401
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:58,880
So I could kind of get an idea, like,

1402
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,940
where does it land in the generation of intels?

1403
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:01,940
And that's pretty neat.

1404
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:02,820
That's all in there.

1405
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:04,180
All right.

1406
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:08,260
One last bit of business before we get out of here.

1407
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:10,900
We have a pic that we've been sitting on for a little while.

1408
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:14,260
Like, this pic needs a round of applause.

1409
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:16,100
It's so good because it's finally

1410
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,940
broken us of the Google Docs habit.

1411
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:24,220
Ladies and gentlemen, I introduce you to Kodi MD.

1412
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:26,380
The funny part here is I was just going to go look this up.

1413
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:27,680
I wanted to pull the link up for myself

1414
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,340
as we're doing the show.

1415
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:30,140
But of course, you're doing it from Kodi MD.

1416
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:30,940
Yeah, I am.

1417
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:35,980
It's a real-time collaborative markdown editor

1418
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:37,980
that is a web-based application.

1419
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:40,660
And its collaborative editing is better than Google Docs.

1420
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:42,260
And one of my favorite things about it,

1421
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:45,460
it has three editing modes, Sublime, Emacs, and Vim,

1422
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:46,420
which is amazing.

1423
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:48,660
You should see Wes whip around this thing in Vim mode.

1424
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,180
It's great.

1425
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:50,740
Oh, it's beautiful.

1426
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:52,340
And we've been trying it out internally

1427
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:56,700
because, honestly, we've been down this road 100 times

1428
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:01,540
and ended up back in the embrace of Google Docs.

1429
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:04,540
But being able to self-host this one in particular

1430
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:07,900
on our own system, the real-time updates

1431
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:11,860
are better than Google Docs, the great support for markdown,

1432
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:14,540
the multiple editing modes, including you've

1433
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:16,540
got markdown split pane mode with markdown

1434
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:18,980
on one side, real-time update and rendering

1435
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:20,580
on the other side.

1436
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:23,180
It works for the way I tend to do live shows, where

1437
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:25,580
I need links in a certain format where I can click on them

1438
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:26,860
while I'm talking.

1439
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:28,920
So it checks boxes that I have personally

1440
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,420
for how I present on air.

1441
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:33,580
But it's also just such a great editor

1442
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:36,500
that I use it for just my general notes.

1443
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,980
And I'm seeing more and more.

1444
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:38,900
It's just taking off.

1445
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,700
I'm seeing more and more people use it.

1446
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:42,620
I'm seeing open source projects start to use it.

1447
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:44,620
I'm seeing podcasts that are using it.

1448
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:45,820
It's a really good tool.

1449
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:47,460
And I think it's just time we gave it some love,

1450
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,100
because we've been using it internally,

1451
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:50,500
kind of holding our breath.

1452
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,220
I mean, initially, like literally,

1453
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:54,700
I think the words you use when you put it up on our system

1454
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:56,420
was, well, I tossed it up on there.

1455
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:58,940
So I mean, I think it's working.

1456
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:02,940
And then we just started using it, and we have not gone back.

1457
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:04,780
And it's been a while now.

1458
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:06,500
So check out KodiMD.

1459
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:09,200
I think their name is about to change.

1460
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,820
And so keep an eye out for that, but we'll

1461
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:11,660
have a link in the show notes.

1462
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:12,620
I've seen some.

1463
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:13,980
I followed one of their change logs,

1464
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:15,860
and they're talking about a name change in there.

1465
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:16,620
I don't know.

1466
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:17,300
I don't know.

1467
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:18,740
Well, and it should be said, too,

1468
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:21,540
that I think we've had up to seven or eight people

1469
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:25,580
collaborating on one document at one time in real time,

1470
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:27,580
seven people on one document.

1471
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:29,460
There's been zero hiccups.

1472
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:30,880
No, you know, they're all working.

1473
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,260
Especially if they're not in a different area of the doc

1474
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:34,060
futzing with stuff.

1475
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:36,620
You just keep going.

1476
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:40,700
And then our last pick, TopGrade,

1477
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:42,880
which upgrades everything.

1478
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:43,780
Who found this one?

1479
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:44,740
That'd be me.

1480
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:45,540
Yeah, all right, Cheesy.

1481
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:46,340
Tell me about this.

1482
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:47,100
Lazy Chees.

1483
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:51,580
So TopGrade, essentially, we all install all of the things

1484
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:53,180
on our systems.

1485
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:57,700
TopGrade supports Arch, Red Hat, Debian, Gentoo, Soos,

1486
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:02,700
Void, Dragonfly, the BSDs, Mac OS, and Windows.

1487
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:06,060
And it basically will update all of the things.

1488
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:16,020
So whether that be PIP package or Vim, Neo Vim packages,

1489
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:21,380
Python from PIPX, just regular updates, ZHS shell updates.

1490
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:25,060
I mean, everything you could want to do, essentially.

1491
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:28,580
Upgrades for your Windows subsystem for Linux

1492
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:29,860
under Windows.

1493
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:34,380
So basically one tool to kind of rule them all as far

1494
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:37,180
as updating your system and keeping it up to date.

1495
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:39,420
OK, this sounds actually pretty sweet.

1496
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:41,220
Yeah, I was going to mock you for like,

1497
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:43,100
is this like a meta package manager?

1498
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:45,620
Wait, also, it's written in Rust.

1499
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:46,620
All right, well, I'm in.

1500
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:46,980
I'm done.

1501
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:47,420
That's it.

1502
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:47,740
That's it.

1503
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:48,420
That's all I needed.

1504
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:49,780
There you have it right there.

1505
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:53,140
Atom packages, Flatpak, Snaps, so all of the things, man.

1506
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:54,700
I hadn't really appreciated the fact

1507
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:57,660
that I got to run several different updaters now.

1508
00:57:57,660 --> 00:57:58,700
You're right.

1509
00:57:58,700 --> 00:57:59,980
That's really annoying.

1510
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:01,260
And this does solve that.

1511
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:04,980
Jeez, you solved a problem before I knew it was a problem.

1512
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:08,300
I knew I hired you for a reason.

1513
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:10,300
All right, well, there you have it, everybody.

1514
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:12,540
Popey was in and out, so I think that means he's probably

1515
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:14,620
going to be back on the Ubuntu podcast very soon.

1516
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:16,220
So if you haven't caught that recently,

1517
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:19,460
go check that out at ubuntupodcast.org.

1518
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:22,380
And he's also on my favorite podcast in the whole world,

1519
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:23,180
User Air.

1520
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:26,580
So go check that out at, is it air.show or user air.show?

1521
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:27,620
Air.show.

1522
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:28,140
Air.show.

1523
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:29,020
See, I don't know, because I just

1524
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:29,860
subscribed to my podcast player.

1525
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:30,820
That's way easier.

1526
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:31,980
It is.

1527
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:33,660
You can also do that for this show.

1528
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:36,420
In fact, would you believe this here show

1529
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:39,820
is in the top 60 technology podcasts on all of iTunes

1530
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:40,980
in the US very frequently?

1531
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:41,700
Say what?

1532
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:42,980
I can't say top 50 yet.

1533
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:43,980
But we could crack it.

1534
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:45,540
If you go over there and give us a thumbs up

1535
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:48,020
and a review on iTunes, and I know only a few of you use it.

1536
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:50,060
If you use Apple Podcasts, more of you use that.

1537
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:51,460
We could use your help.

1538
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:54,140
We may crack the top 50 in all tech podcasts

1539
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:55,580
in the United States.

1540
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:57,660
And we're crushing it in some other countries too.

1541
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,860
So actually, call out to those of you outside the US.

1542
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:00,700
Amazing.

1543
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:01,020
I know.

1544
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:02,140
It's actually really neat.

1545
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:03,540
Help spread the good word to Linux.

1546
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,900
It's called Humble Linux Podcast.

1547
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:05,580
All right.

1548
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:07,100
See you back here next Tuesday.

1549
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:07,620
Ah!

1550
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:31,580
Thank you so much for listening!

1551
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:46,140
All right, let's pick our title.

1552
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:48,820
You know, I just ran download because it's Rust, right?

1553
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:52,720
So you just download the tar and there's a single executable in there and away you go.

1554
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:53,900
So it's upgrading all my things.

1555
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:58,700
I'm not even sure I know how to really update Emacs packages, you know, by hand, but that's

1556
00:59:58,700 --> 00:59:59,700
fine now because they're done.

1557
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:00,700
I'm going to try it on my Fedora box.

1558
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:01,700
And here's all the gems.

1559
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:02,700
All right.

1560
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:03,700
Wow.

1561
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:04,700
Really?

1562
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:05,700
That's pretty neat.

1563
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:06,700
Yeah.

1564
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:09,260
So I was about to give cheese a hard time for not using Ansible or something, and then

1565
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:13,620
I actually read what it did and then shut up because that is amazing.

1566
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:14,620
Good job.

1567
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:15,620
Good find.

1568
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:19,740
Well, you know, I know that I've ran into that problem where, you know, I've had additional

1569
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:24,060
pip packages or something that I've installed and yeah, no one checks those things.

1570
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:25,060
No, right.

1571
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:26,060
Yeah.

1572
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:30,380
Like, you know, I'll have to update whatever I'll, you know, and but I never think to update

1573
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:31,380
that pip package.

1574
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:35,080
So having something that I can just boom, any package that's essentially on the system

1575
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:36,080
gets updated.

1576
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:40,900
And I didn't run brew upgrade on my Mac for a year plus.

1577
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:43,740
The only time I ever update YouTube DL is when it fails to download.

1578
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:44,740
Oh, right.

1579
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:45,740
I need to go update that.

1580
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:46,740
So now it's on.

1581
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:47,740
I'm on like the YouTube DL direct track.

1582
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:48,740
Yes.

1583
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:49,740
Getting the good stuff direct.

1584
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:50,740
Yeah, that's right.

1585
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:52,100
Well, I wasn't exaggerating.

1586
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:58,100
I feel like like this, the stuff that just we just touched the surface of Home Assistant

1587
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:02,020
and it was like like a new world has opened up to me.

1588
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:03,020
I'm wow.

1589
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:04,020
Yeah, man.

1590
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:07,740
And I told you in my talk at Linux Fest Northwest, right?

1591
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:08,740
I know.

1592
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:10,700
You have to solve a real world problem.

1593
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:14,940
And then it's just like your eyes just light up and you're like, this is amazing.

1594
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:19,020
It's like I talked about just kind of like a revelation I had with Docker and containers

1595
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:20,020
on Coder recently.

1596
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:23,460
It's like when I get my hands on it, like there's the practical and then there's the

1597
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:24,460
hands on.

1598
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:29,660
And when you go hands on, it's for me, it's just a whole nother level of appreciation

1599
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:30,660
and fascination.

1600
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:33,980
It's direct meaning, you know, you can actually see it's solving problems that you couldn't

1601
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:34,980
solve before.

1602
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:37,220
Well, Poppy, it was great to have you on the show today.

1603
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:38,220
Welcome back, sir.

1604
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:39,220
How was the travel?

1605
01:01:39,220 --> 01:01:40,220
It was good.

1606
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:41,220
Suffering from jet lag.

1607
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:42,220
It's too late.

1608
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:43,220
It's gone.

1609
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:44,220
No, it's gone.

1610
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:45,220
We'll just do it.

1611
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:46,220
Do you want to?

1612
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:50,220
I mean, if you if you can join us on the Chrome app, if you want, but then you just have to

1613
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:51,780
record locally is the only downside.

1614
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:52,780
No.

1615
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:53,780
No.

1616
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:54,780
All right.

1617
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:55,780
Well, it was good having you.

1618
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:56,780
Linux sucks.

1619
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:57,780
Yeah.

1620
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:58,780
That's it.

1621
01:01:58,780 --> 01:01:59,780
I'm switching to Windows.

1622
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:00,780
All right.

1623
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:01,780
Well, it was good seeing you.

1624
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:02,780
Glad you could join us.

1625
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:03,780
If you can get installed by the end of the show, come back on.

1626
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:04,780
Love you all.

1627
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:33,780
Love you, Poppy.
