00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,320
Welcome into Linux Unplugged, episode 385.

2
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,320
My name is Chris.

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,600
My name is Wes.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,680
And no hiding it, there's a Drew over there too.

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,680
Heyo.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,560
You guys, you look good.

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,560
You look real good today.

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,000
We all dressed up for the tuxes.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,600
We're all wearing our going to town clothes because it's a very special episode where

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,600
we get to say thank you to a lot of open source projects and see who our audience voted as

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,340
some of the best in newcomers and distributions and text editors, just about everything you

12
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,360
think we'd nerd out on.

13
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,440
So it's a special episode today.

14
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:50,280
We're also going to do a special holiday unboxing here in a little bit.

15
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,920
And we have a special guest joining us to help us go over all of the new goodies that

16
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,200
have landed in Plasma and just the state of Plasma in 2020. Nate, welcome back to the

17
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,200
show, man.

18
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,200
Hi there.

19
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,200
Thanks.

20
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,200
It's great to be here.

21
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,200
Man, it's great to have you.

22
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,200
So hold on.

23
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,200
We're going to get to Plasma here in just a moment.

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,520
But before we do that, I have to say thank you to a Cloud Guru for sponsoring this episode.

25
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,880
They're the leader in hands-on learning.

26
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,200
The only way to learn a new skill is by doing.

27
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,600
And that's why ACG provides hands-on labs, Cloud Linux servers, and much more.

28
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,720
So get your hands cloudy at a CloudGuru.com.

29
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,600
I psyched your mind, Mumble Room.

30
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,760
You thought I was going to call on you.

31
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,760
Some appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

32
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,760
Hello.

33
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,760
Hello.

34
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,760
Hello.

35
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,760
Hello.

36
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,760
Hello.

37
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,760
Hello.

38
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,760
Hello, everybody.

39
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,760
Good to have you in there.

40
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,480
Thank you so much for being here.

41
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,240
I'm looking forward to our discussions as we analyze who the winners are this year.

42
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,860
Also, I'm glad you're here for the surprise unboxing for Mr. West.

43
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:50,600
And this year on Coda Radio, I've started talking a lot about how I think Plasma is

44
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:56,400
a fantastic workstation for developers and administrators who want a really stable, rock-solid

45
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,360
Linux base, but want something that's like a power tool.

46
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,880
I've made the equivalence before that you know how you might have like a cordless drill

47
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,560
in your garage that's pretty capable, but then you go into like a vehicle shop that

48
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:15,560
has like one of these air-powered suckers and it just can take a thing apart in 10 seconds?

49
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,880
That's what Plasma is, in my view, when you look at the different desktops out there.

50
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:25,160
But they've managed over 2020 to really polish that thing and make a lot of these things

51
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,520
that were rough edges in the past a lot smoother now.

52
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,360
And Nate Graham has been tracking all of these developments week by week on his blog.

53
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,680
Since we've had you on forever ago, you're still doing it like a soldier of the Plasma

54
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,680
desktop.

55
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,680
I really appreciate it.

56
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,240
I love reading through these.

57
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,240
Sure am.

58
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,240
It's a lot of fun.

59
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,040
I mean, like, first of all, thanks, man.

60
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,040
You're welcome.

61
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,160
Like, geez, that's got to be a lot of work.

62
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,680
To do it every single week like that.

63
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,880
I got to admit, it takes quite a while.

64
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,720
I typically start writing each new post before I finish the old one.

65
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,720
Wow.

66
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,360
And I just kind of keep building them up throughout the whole week.

67
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,200
I used to do it on like Saturday night right before I hit post, but it would take hours

68
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,200
and hours and hours.

69
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,700
So now I just keep the draft open all week and add new stuff as I see it get merged,

70
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,280
which is a lot more a lot more reasonable to do.

71
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,960
But yeah, it takes a while.

72
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,540
I know those workflows very well myself.

73
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,320
You know, we have a similar kind of approach with the shows is they're kind of in development

74
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,240
from the moment we end them to the next one.

75
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,360
You must be doing what?

76
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,320
I mean, a bunch of VMs in some cases and whatnot.

77
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,760
That way you can get a screenshot or try something because you got to kind of understand it to

78
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,760
write about it.

79
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,360
Actually, I don't use any virtual machines at all.

80
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,400
I run my entire computer on built from source KDE Plasma stuff.

81
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,780
So the first thing I do every morning is build every piece of KDE software from Gitmaster.

82
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,940
And then use that stuff.

83
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,400
So when I need to take a screenshot, I'm literally taking a screenshot of my own desktop.

84
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,820
This is all stuff that's in in production in use.

85
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,800
And I feel like personally, it's pretty amazing how stable our Gitmaster stuff is because

86
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,920
so many people are actually running their their plasma sessions like this.

87
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,600
So we actually have a lot of internal QA.

88
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,820
But yeah, no VMs for me.

89
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:14,920
Careful now you're giving Chris ideas and maybe not good ones.

90
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,040
It's super stable, man.

91
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,040
You can do it.

92
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,460
And once once you use a rolling release distro, I've had people tell me that they read my

93
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:25,860
blog posts and they say, Oh, man, I switched to arch, I switched to Manjaro or tumbleweed,

94
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,360
because I wanted this stuff really fast.

95
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,400
But now I feel like it's not fast enough anymore, because I want the new stuff.

96
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,400
Now.

97
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,400
I don't want to wait three months.

98
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,520
Well, you make you make an art user look chill.

99
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:42,120
But I need to kind of it kind of feels like it's a new form of of journalism.

100
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:47,560
Like it's a it's a form of journalism that is unique, and only kind of possible with

101
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,520
free software.

102
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,460
And do you do you see it as a form of journalism?

103
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,720
Or do you see it as a form of project advocacy?

104
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,680
You know, I kind of see it as a bit of both.

105
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,480
This is something that I thought myself about, because I didn't really set out to do something

106
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,480
like this.

107
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:08,560
I originally wanted to just categorize and tell people about what had gone on for the

108
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,560
usability and productivity initiative that we had a few years ago.

109
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:19,040
And what I realized over time was that it had become a form of like marketing, as well

110
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:24,680
as just description, because people would be really interested in seeing what stuff

111
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,400
was going to happen in the future, like they would get excited.

112
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,220
And they would say, Oh, I want to use this stuff right now.

113
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,000
And that was definitely not my goal to start out with, it was supposed to be descriptive,

114
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,600
but it's, it's turned into something that's like a little bit between advocacy and journalism,

115
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,600
I would say.

116
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,840
And it also gives the users a sense of continued forward progress.

117
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,560
That was actually the entire point.

118
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,560
Yeah, yeah.

119
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,560
Okay.

120
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,400
When I when I originally started this a few years ago, I started using plasma and other

121
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,440
KDE software.

122
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,600
And I said to myself, Wow, this stuff is really great.

123
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,680
But you know, I read all of this negativity all over social media, people seem to have

124
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,080
this impression that it's like it's dead.

125
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,840
Its developers are mean and rude.

126
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,280
You know, there's all this stuff that doesn't work properly.

127
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,280
It's really buggy.

128
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,920
And like, that wasn't really my experience.

129
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:18,600
And I felt like if I could be a voice for the opposite, showing just what I saw of the

130
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,360
project, it would help to counter that narrative that to me seemed like it was very dated.

131
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,460
Like maybe this was true 10 or 15 years ago, but it didn't seem true in in that moment.

132
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,640
And I really feel like that was successful.

133
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,360
Because I don't think those old stereotypes are true anymore.

134
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,720
Like people used to say, Oh, it's so bloated, it takes up a gigabyte of RAM, I can't use

135
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,720
it.

136
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,780
But now, plasma is known as one of the most lightweight desktop environments out there.

137
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,760
And like, we still see people who believe that old stuff.

138
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:53,660
But you know, now there's there's always a cohort of people who understand the truth

139
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,200
that all this performance work that we've done over like the last couple of years, or

140
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,280
even like a decade or more, have paid off and everybody can benefit from it.

141
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,520
So I think it's really important to have a direct line to your users so that you can

142
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,240
be pushing a narrative that's true to counter misinformation out there.

143
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,540
And sometimes the misinformation, it isn't like it isn't malicious, right?

144
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:21,120
Like somebody who used KDE 15 years ago, their impression back then was was probably true,

145
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,160
even though it doesn't match the state of reality today.

146
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,160
So like, sometimes, countering that misinformation doesn't mean like putting somebody in their

147
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,800
place, but just giving out the correct information that's true today.

148
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,900
Yeah, and then letting another version be seen and read about and I think you I just

149
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:46,160
watching it and seeing how the community discusses plasma now, it's, it's, it's really in a much

150
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,160
more positive tone.

151
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,260
I think it's had a significant noticeable impact.

152
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:55,000
And so I thought, why don't we bring people up to date on kind of some of the stuff you've

153
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,440
you've really thought was the most interesting in plasma in 2020.

154
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,400
And maybe if there's other KDE apps to that you think we should include in there.

155
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,500
But it's a big question.

156
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,140
But you know, I took I kind of took most of 2020 off from plasma and then just came back

157
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,520
to it a month ago.

158
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:17,900
And I'm like, Oh, man, I can see even in that time, there's been noticeable improvements

159
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,440
with with like the brightness controls and just all the widgets down by the clock that

160
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,440
I use all the time.

161
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,440
Oh, awesome.

162
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,440
I was I was gonna talk about that quite a bit.

163
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,440
So I'm glad you noticed.

164
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,440
Well, do you want to start there?

165
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,600
Because I've noticed there's nice little improvements that have landed and maybe that's one of them

166
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,600
we should start with.

167
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,560
So this, this was a specific improvement that we really set out to do.

168
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:40,300
It's been in the planning stages for over a year, but the system tray, as I believe

169
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:44,680
what you're referring to, and this was one of the oldest parts of plasma five, it was

170
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:49,120
it was, you know, most of this code was years and years old.

171
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,760
And it was like good for the time, but it could really stand a lot of modernization.

172
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,340
And so Katie's VDG group, this is the visual design group.

173
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:01,560
We also do interaction design stuff, we set out to improve and modernize the system tray

174
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,820
applets.

175
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,540
And over the course of 2020, we've we've done a ton of that.

176
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,540
If you look at the current state in plasma 520, I think it's pretty good.

177
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,800
And in 521, it just gets even better.

178
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:20,360
And we made a bunch of improvements such as using a unified theming for all of the applets.

179
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,400
So they don't seem so unique anymore.

180
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,220
They all kind of have a common theme.

181
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,180
We have like a defined header area on top.

182
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:32,020
And in plasma 521, we're even going to have an almost like header bar style, where we

183
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:37,860
have the title bar and the controls merged into the same row.

184
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,260
We have common controls used for everything.

185
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,760
So the amount of code and the bugginess is hugely decreased.

186
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,620
We've worked on the visual presentation for system tray applets that have a visual component

187
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,620
like the media player.

188
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,220
Oh, the media player looks so nice now.

189
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,700
It's really, really, really pretty looking.

190
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,700
Yeah.

191
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,700
And so on and so forth.

192
00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:00,280
We just we kind of went down the line with every individual system tray applet and reviewed

193
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:05,380
the usability reviewed the aesthetics and just said, how can we polish this and make

194
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,460
that individual applet the best version of itself.

195
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:13,300
And then we went back to the whole system tray itself, which is like the containment

196
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,440
for these applets.

197
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,660
And we tried to make them integrate well into the system tray so that it seems like a really

198
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:23,700
cohesive unit and just make it make it better, basically.

199
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,020
And I feel like we've succeeded.

200
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:28,620
So I'm really glad you noticed that and brought it up because that tells me that our work

201
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,620
was impactful.

202
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,620
Yeah.

203
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,120
No, noticeable.

204
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,060
It seems like and maybe this has been landing in bits over time to but system settings has

205
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,020
seen a bunch of rework.

206
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,700
It feels much more streamlined and easier to navigate.

207
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,700
Awesome.

208
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,420
It was a sensation that I just had to go hunt for everything and now it seems much more

209
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,420
discoverable.

210
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,420
That's great.

211
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,420
Yeah.

212
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,780
System settings is another example where we've done a lot of iterative design.

213
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:56,260
Most people don't realize that system settings is actually one of the most complicated pieces

214
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:01,580
of code we have because each individual page is actually a tiny app.

215
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:07,700
So system settings is basically a shell around like 120 apps, which is kind of mind boggling

216
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,700
to think about.

217
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:13,740
And that's why a lot of this work gets done in a very incremental fashion instead of,

218
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,940
you know, all at once and then it's done.

219
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:19,060
But I'm glad you noticed that, too, because we have definitely done that.

220
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:24,640
One thing that we're doing over time is rewriting the old system settings pages in QML, which

221
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,520
makes them a lot easier to improve in the future.

222
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:33,160
It gives us a chance to revisit the user interface for that particular page.

223
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,660
And it also makes those pages usable on plasma mobile, too, because plasma mobile does not

224
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:43,140
have the ability to use QWidgets based system settings pages, only QML ones.

225
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,020
So we have the convergence aspect there, too.

226
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:51,380
And over the course of 2020, we have rewritten eight pages in QML and there are a couple

227
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:56,620
more that are in review and hopefully will be merged within maybe a week or two or something

228
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,740
like that.

229
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,380
So yeah, that's a bunch of stuff.

230
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,820
But we also have a bunch of new features in system settings, too.

231
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:08,180
We also have one thing that's been really popular among our users is an automatic syncing

232
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:12,300
system for your KDE app settings to GTK apps.

233
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:17,820
So like when you change the font size in your KDE apps, it changes the font size in GTK

234
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,820
apps as well.

235
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:22,940
When you change the color scheme in your KDE apps, it changes the color scheme in GTK apps,

236
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,940
stuff like that.

237
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,500
This used to be a manual process and you'd have to do it yourself.

238
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,660
Now it's automatic.

239
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,620
It just happens on its own.

240
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,260
That's been very well received.

241
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:35,460
We also have a feature in system settings that lets you highlight settings that you've

242
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,760
changed from their default values.

243
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,740
We did this because people would often say, oh, man, system settings is really complicated.

244
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:45,020
I tweaked a bunch of stuff and now I don't know what I did.

245
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:48,620
So we did that so that people could visualize what changes they actually made so that they

246
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:52,100
could see whether they wanted to keep them or not once they found themselves in that

247
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,100
situation.

248
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,800
And there's tons of polish throughout the stack, too.

249
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,060
This is really neat.

250
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:02,740
I had not noticed this before, so essentially it marks them almost like with an unread indicator.

251
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,380
And you want to know what's really cool.

252
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,780
You're looking at the orange dot on the sidebar now, right?

253
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,780
Yeah.

254
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,780
Yeah.

255
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:12,020
So if you click on one of those items that has an orange dot, it will actually highlight

256
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:16,460
the individual settings on the page that have been changed.

257
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,240
This was a ton of work, by the way.

258
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,180
So it's I'm really happy with it.

259
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,780
Yeah, it looks slick, but you can tell there's some logic behind the scenes there.

260
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,780
Oh, tons.

261
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,780
Yeah.

262
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:29,760
There's tons of logic because, like I said earlier, every system's settings page is like

263
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,060
a tiny app.

264
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:36,100
So what this required us to do was rewrite a lot of these pages so that they used a common

265
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,100
base.

266
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,380
Previously, a lot of them were just like literally their own apps.

267
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:45,980
And now to make this highlight change settings feature work, we created a sort of framework

268
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:50,520
that they all inherit from so that when you write a new system settings page, you plug

269
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,460
it into this preexisting framework and that feature just works automatically.

270
00:13:54,460 --> 00:14:00,100
And porting all, you know, 100 of those pages to use this thing was a Herculean task.

271
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,980
So I'm really happy that it works as well as it does.

272
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,980
Yeah.

273
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,900
And that is that's a feature now that I will mention that when people I had no idea.

274
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,820
I had noticed that button there, but I hadn't tried it yet.

275
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,940
And I can only imagine the amount of work that went into it.

276
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,500
And that's something I'll tell people to check out.

277
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,860
Yeah, it's pretty nice.

278
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:19,360
And a really cool thing is that because we've now ported all of these pages to use this

279
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,480
common base, all of the pages now know what their default settings are.

280
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,620
They know how they differ from their default settings.

281
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,900
So this opens up the door for us in the future to add a much requested feature that will

282
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,620
allow you to reset everything to its default settings because all the pages actually know

283
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,820
what those are now.

284
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,060
So we'll be able to do that without having to, like, brute force it by just blowing away

285
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,060
the config files.

286
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,900
You know, the chat room is, you know, the chat room is thinking they think, you know,

287
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:47,660
what we want now is we want to sync those settings between plasma desktops.

288
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,660
That's what they're thinking.

289
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,040
So this is this is another feature.

290
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,900
And again, it's something that's made possible by the plumbing work that we did for this.

291
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:59,380
Now that every page knows what settings have been changed from their default values, it

292
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:03,900
becomes really easy to, you know, reset them, export that.

293
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,980
A syncing feature between plasma desktops would be amazing.

294
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,340
But that, of course, requires a bunch more work on the on the server side.

295
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,780
You need all sorts of sync and deduplication stuff.

296
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,140
And that's a whole nother can of worms.

297
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,140
But that'd be great.

298
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,140
Sure.

299
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:22,340
So finally, maybe something over next cloud would work, you know, sync file like I could

300
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,780
see a DIY version of that working pretty well.

301
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:31,060
Is there maybe anything you want to touch on that maybe isn't so user noticeable but

302
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,020
still has been a good improvement, anything on your mind there?

303
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:38,740
There's another big thing that we did, which is the optional system deintegration throughout

304
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,300
plasma.

305
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:45,220
This is something that probably nobody will even notice because it's not even on by default

306
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,220
right now.

307
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:50,540
We're hoping, I believe, to turn it on by default for plasma 521.

308
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:53,440
But of course, because we're K to E, you can turn it off as well.

309
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:59,180
But the gist of what's going on here is that we have refactored the way plasma starts itself

310
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:06,300
and starts its components and starts apps to make use of systems, the slices and C groups

311
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,340
and units.

312
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,780
So now everything happens in a predictable order.

313
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,820
Things can be parallelized without them running into each other.

314
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,460
This means that startup times will be improved.

315
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,980
This means that we have things that are scoped properly.

316
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,380
So when you log out of your session, everything quits rather than having dangling processes.

317
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:31,060
It means that we're able to group an app's individual child processes into that app itself.

318
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:35,100
This is especially relevant for apps in Flatpaks and Electron apps.

319
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:39,060
Like if you run Discord or something and you look at the process tree, it has like 10 processes.

320
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,060
Yeah.

321
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,340
So it's sort of hard to tell what it's actually doing.

322
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:49,660
And when you now with this new feature activated, when you launch Discord using plasma, it will

323
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,540
be scoped in its own C group.

324
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,060
So all of its child processes will be able to be associated with the parent.

325
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,700
And we can now have an applications view that says, hey, here's Discord.

326
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:03,740
And it combines together all of the different resource usages of the child processes.

327
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,740
That is so cool.

328
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,740
I know.

329
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,740
Isn't it great?

330
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,740
It's super cool.

331
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,700
This leads me to another really cool thing, which is the new system monitoring app.

332
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:15,580
This is something that we have released as a standalone app and it's going to be, I believe,

333
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:19,540
included in Plasma 5.21 by default, but we basically rewrote KSysGuard, which is our

334
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,680
old system monitoring app.

335
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,820
And the new one is now fully C group and slice aware.

336
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,500
So it has that nice applications page.

337
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,620
It has beautiful, pretty graphs that use a new hardware accelerated graphing framework

338
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,940
that we wrote that now is used for other things.

339
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,100
And it's 100% customizable too.

340
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:41,620
So this actually reminds me of what you said before about Plasma being like a power tool

341
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,240
used by pros.

342
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:49,620
And I'm glad you mentioned that because this is like my personal idea of what Plasma should

343
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,620
be.

344
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:56,380
This is like a productivity tool for people who use their computers to make a living.

345
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:00,280
And we designed the system monitoring app so that it's super customizable.

346
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:06,460
If you monitor like a fleet of machines or if you monitor specific aspects of your system,

347
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:11,620
you can actually customize the pages on this new system monitoring app in a 100% granular

348
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,800
way to make it show exactly what you want.

349
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,580
And because it uses this fancy charting framework, not only is it customizable and powerful,

350
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,080
it's also really pretty too.

351
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,780
So that's a pretty nice improvement.

352
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,780
That's great.

353
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,780
Oh yeah.

354
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,780
Wow.

355
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:32,740
So that's probably one of my favorite things to see is that those kinds of tools are still

356
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:37,260
getting investment that they're not just sitting around and just, you know, ah, good enough.

357
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,460
I really could have seen that argument made for something like KSYSGuard.

358
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,460
Oh, it's good enough.

359
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:45,180
If somebody wants something more, they'll go use something on the command line.

360
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,740
One of those annoying top things we keep recommending.

361
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,740
Yeah.

362
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,620
I don't believe in good enough personally.

363
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,960
I think everything can always be improved.

364
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,780
So where does 2021 take us?

365
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:01,180
It doesn't sound like anything too radical as planned, but more just continued investments.

366
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,180
Yeah.

367
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:06,500
A lot of what I've told you is stuff that users don't have yet because it's just been

368
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:11,380
merged into Gitmaster and it's planned for Plasma 5.21.

369
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,540
And that's going to be released in a few months in the early part of 2021.

370
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:20,020
So to a large extent, getting this stuff to users is what's in 2021.

371
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:24,660
Personally there are two things that I am really looking forward to for 2021.

372
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:30,380
One is the remainder of our visual overhaul, which I believe it or not didn't even start

373
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:35,780
to talk about, but we have throughout 2020 been landing all kinds of visual overhauls

374
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,780
of other things too.

375
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:42,300
Not just the system tray, but we've been doing Plasma, our breeze theme for apps, technically

376
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,940
speaking lives in Plasma.

377
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:49,260
It's in like a Plasma aligned release cycle product.

378
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,100
So that's been happening there as well.

379
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:56,460
And I think we're going to continue to do this and really make people think that KDE

380
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,220
apps look amazing in 2021.

381
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:03,820
One of the remaining complaints that I feel like I kept hearing about people saying, oh,

382
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:08,940
it's lightweight now and it's really powerful, but KDE apps are really ugly.

383
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:15,820
So we hear that and we're working on it very quickly to improve the look of KDE apps.

384
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:20,580
You'll see that in 5.21 and Plasma 5.22 as well.

385
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:24,540
Another thing that I think we're going to see in a big way in the year 2021 is more

386
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,700
Wayland stuff.

387
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,380
2020 was a huge year for our Wayland session.

388
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,780
We got tons and tons of stuff.

389
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:35,860
We got screencasting, we got shared clipboard support, we got middle click paste support,

390
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:40,800
we got multi GPU output support, screen rotation, task manager window thumbnails, the global

391
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,220
menu now works on Wayland, we got high DPI screenshots with Spectacle, we have the virtual

392
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:50,580
keyboard working for GTK apps, and we have configurable mouse and touchpad scroll speed

393
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:54,540
on Wayland, which is also a thing that you don't have on X11.

394
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,740
So it was huge.

395
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,300
It was gigantic.

396
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:03,380
Actually for me, in 2019, Wayland was like a buggy mess.

397
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,420
Our Wayland session, I just couldn't use it.

398
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,500
It felt like a construction zone.

399
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:16,140
Whereas today, in the end of 2020, I can almost use the Plasma Wayland session for day-to-day

400
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,140
stuff.

401
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,940
They're just like little mini annoyances and problems.

402
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:24,380
So I feel like there's been a quantum leap in our Wayland compatibility.

403
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:30,740
And I feel like in 2021, we're probably going to see people start using it by default.

404
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:36,580
Fedora, for example, in Fedora 34, they're planning on using the Plasma Wayland session

405
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,960
by default.

406
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,820
They're shipping it to users and turning it on by default.

407
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,780
So you have to opt into X11.

408
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,420
That's how much they think it's come.

409
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,420
And you know, Fedora, they're very technology-first forward people.

410
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:52,860
They really like being on the bleeding edge, but they think it's ready.

411
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,420
So that is, I think, a good vote of confidence.

412
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:01,060
And I think we're really going to see Wayland become totally mainstream in Plasma in 2021.

413
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,060
Wow.

414
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:07,740
Well, you know, I have been testing it on Fedora Plasma, on my X1 Carbon.

415
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,780
And it works really well for me unless I start using an external display.

416
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,380
And then it gets a little wonky when I have both screens going.

417
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,400
But otherwise, I can pretty much use it all day long.

418
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,420
And I feel like it seems a little bit smoother to me.

419
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,740
Yeah, it should be.

420
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,700
So I like it.

421
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,300
I am really looking forward to 2021.

422
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:36,140
Like Jitty in the chat room said, that it's just kind of a no-brainer these days to use

423
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,140
Plasma.

424
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,620
Oh, I'm happy to hear that.

425
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:42,140
Personally, I feel the same way.

426
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,180
That's the way I want everybody to see it.

427
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,540
You know, I think you shouldn't have to compromise to use our stuff.

428
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,540
It should be lightweight.

429
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,240
It should have lots of features.

430
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,360
It should be stable without a lot of bugs.

431
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,220
And it should be beautiful.

432
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,220
That's my goal.

433
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,220
And powerful.

434
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,660
And, you know, I really feel like it's gotten there.

435
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:01,180
You really could set it up in just, you know, pretty much any distribution set by default

436
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,180
and use it that way.

437
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:07,940
Or you could spend, like I spent about a day slowly going through and just setting something,

438
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,380
using it a little bit like that and then adjusting it.

439
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,980
And after about that day, I never touch it again.

440
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,660
And it just stays that way forever.

441
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,660
Awesome.

442
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,660
It's great.

443
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,660
I'm curious.

444
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,980
What do you make to your plasma?

445
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,500
It kind of depends.

446
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:26,220
I, for some reason, didn't totally like the new taskbar and all of that.

447
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:31,020
And I ended up trying Latte Dock and putting it in the plasma mode.

448
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,720
So it's still more like a bar.

449
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,380
And I just kind of have liked that a little bit better.

450
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:40,840
Although on some of my plasma setups, the majority of them, I just have a standard taskbar

451
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:46,420
at the bottom, you know, Kubuntu style, and have just left it like that on the work machines.

452
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,420
And it's been fine.

453
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,920
Even on the laptop, I like to play around a little bit.

454
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,540
And so I went for kind of a smaller dock down there.

455
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,300
It doesn't go all the way edge to edge.

456
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:59,340
It's more in the middle of the screen, but it doesn't do all the fancy like magnification

457
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,340
stuff.

458
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,380
It looks like a plasma panel.

459
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,660
You wouldn't even know it's Latte Dock.

460
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,020
Yeah, it integrates really well.

461
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,780
I know a lot of people love Latte Dock.

462
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,780
I've liked it.

463
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,780
Yeah.

464
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,380
I may try going back sometime, you know, but it's worked pretty well for me.

465
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:14,220
And then of course, I try different dark themes these days.

466
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,220
I try out a couple of different ones.

467
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:19,100
I really like how things now work with the global theme to just change it there instead

468
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:25,540
of having to go to each individual colors and icons and application appearances, window

469
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,940
frame appearances, just the global theme now.

470
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,940
Yeah, that's great.

471
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,740
That's our intention.

472
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:35,620
As a fan of that, I actually have to mention in Plasma 5.21, we're shipping a new global

473
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:40,740
theme called Breeze Twilight, which has a dark color scheme for Plasma and a light color

474
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,740
scheme for apps.

475
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,740
Oh, interesting.

476
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,740
Hmm.

477
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,740
That's great.

478
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:49,820
Well, Nate, I could go on all day, but we have some tuxes to get to you.

479
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,460
I really appreciate you coming on.

480
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:55,900
And I also really, really appreciate and thank you for all the hard work you do documenting

481
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,020
all of these improvements.

482
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:02,740
We will have a link, of course, to your This Week in KDE posts.

483
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,740
What do you have?

484
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,740
Is that the title?

485
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,740
Is that the official title?

486
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,540
Yeah, it used to be Usability and Productivity back when that was a thing, but now it's This

487
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,540
Week in KDE.

488
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,540
Yeah.

489
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,540
And you know what?

490
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,540
It's not always just Plasma.

491
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:15,660
I mean, there's sometimes other things in the KDE ecosystem in there as well.

492
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:19,020
And I want to stress that this is my view of the project.

493
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,260
KDE is so vast.

494
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:25,780
We have like hundreds of apps, so I can only follow a small percentage of things.

495
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:30,940
So there's always much more stuff going on than what I can document, but it's like Plasma

496
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:35,460
plus what I consider to be sort of the core apps that most people are going to experience.

497
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,460
Also we should say happy birthday.

498
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,060
I think Kate just hit 20 years old.

499
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,060
It did.

500
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,380
So happy birthday to Kate.

501
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,380
I just reinstalled it.

502
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,740
I'm almost drinking the USA.

503
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,740
That's right.

504
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:48,780
The chat room is joking that the KDE Christmas party is spelled with a K. I like that.

505
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,780
That tickles me.

506
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,780
All right, Nate.

507
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,780
Thank you very much for joining us.

508
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,780
Thank you for having me.

509
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,780
It was great.

510
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,780
Yep.

511
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,780
Keep up the great work and happy holidays.

512
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,780
Thanks a lot.

513
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,780
You too.

514
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:58,780
All right, Wes.

515
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:03,380
Well, I'll let you update your Plasma desktop over there while I take a moment and take

516
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:10,800
a break here and say thank you to Linode at linode.com slash unplugged.

517
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,060
Go there to get a $100 60 day credit towards your new account.

518
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,660
Try spinning up a server on their cloud infrastructure.

519
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:20,580
They make it really simple to get a Linux server up in the cloud in seconds and they

520
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,960
have 11 data centers around the world.

521
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,560
They also have features like object storage and node balancers and a dashboard to manage

522
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,060
all of this and API that makes it possible to do it all from the command line, which

523
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,820
is actually how I do it.

524
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,260
It's not as nerdy as it sounds.

525
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,980
It's pretty easy and straightforward.

526
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:38,900
But they also have, well, brilliant support.

527
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:43,600
Mr. S writes into the show and he says, I was introduced to Linode based on your mentions

528
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,600
on the show.

529
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:49,260
I am not yet a paying customer of Linode, so having a somewhat particularly interesting

530
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:54,300
challenge with an NGO I am volunteering for, I contacted Linode support.

531
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:58,900
Now mind you, this was after I contacted several major cloud providers, some of which who I'm

532
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:03,260
a paying customer, some who completely ignored me, others just simply brushed me off.

533
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:06,080
But Linode was the complete opposite.

534
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,560
Even after understanding that I'm not a paying customer and you know, to be honest, my particular

535
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,320
problem won't generate any revenue for them.

536
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:18,260
They went above and beyond to try to assist me coming up with a resolution for the sole

537
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,200
purpose of doing good.

538
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,220
Their support team was just brilliant, Mr. S says.

539
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:27,540
He goes on to say they were responsive, kind, to the point and above all, with a genuine

540
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:30,420
will to assist and resolve problems.

541
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:34,900
I'm dealing with a major cloud service and their support teams on a daily basis and Linode's

542
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:38,180
support team, based on my experience, really stands above and beyond.

543
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,220
Kind regards, Mr. S.

544
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:44,420
And I remember when I had that feeling too, when I was like, wow, you stuck with this

545
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,540
problem when you didn't have to.

546
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,420
And it really feels good when somebody goes above and beyond.

547
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,780
And that's what Linode's support team does.

548
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:54,940
And Mr. S, he was, he felt so impacted by it, he bothered to write in.

549
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,940
I mean, think about that.

550
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,340
When have you, you know, he had to take a minute to actually write that email to us

551
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,620
to share that experience.

552
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,300
That's how much it hit him.

553
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,300
And that's Linode.

554
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,460
That's one of the reasons I love them is they're independent.

555
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,540
I get why they do this.

556
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,220
They do this for a love of Linux.

557
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,200
That's why they've sponsored projects like Kubuntu.

558
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,280
That's why they sponsor this here podcast and other Linux creators out there, because

559
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:19,340
they want to make it possible for independent content to give media about this away for

560
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,340
free.

561
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,340
That's part of what they're doing here.

562
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,020
And it's just, it's a great company all around.

563
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:27,760
Plus, you get that $100 credit when you go to linode.com slash unplugged.

564
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,740
Go there and get yourself a special something, linode.com slash unplugged.

565
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:35,260
And a big thanks to Linode for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

566
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,920
All right.

567
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,740
So I surprised Wes the other day.

568
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,460
Are you ready for this, Mr. Payne?

569
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,060
Oh, you sure did.

570
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,700
And this was a lot of fun.

571
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:50,980
So we were sitting in here just a day or two or three or eight ago, and we were doing one

572
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:55,020
of the things we do, podcast, and I had a moment to surprise Wes.

573
00:28:55,020 --> 00:29:00,180
So I turned the mics on and I kind of didn't really tell Wes what was going on.

574
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,340
I was just like, come on, sit down.

575
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,220
Let's open up the Linux Unplugged profile.

576
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,220
He's kind of looking around.

577
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,180
He's thinking to himself, do I need to prepare?

578
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:13,780
Just kind of going along, which was great, because it worked out perfect for a special

579
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:16,700
secret Santa surprise we had for Mr. Wes Payne.

580
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:21,420
You know what I love about you, Wes, is that we have been going at this all day, and I've

581
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:24,460
told you all day long I wanted to record a Linux Unplugged segment, but you haven't actually

582
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:28,300
really even bothered asking me until just now what we're actually talking about.

583
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,020
I figured you'd tell me when you were ready.

584
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,020
I am.

585
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,700
But I forgot the box.

586
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,700
So hold on.

587
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,700
You stay right there.

588
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,700
You don't move.

589
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,700
I'll get the box.

590
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,700
It's my treat, Wes.

591
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,700
You're fine.

592
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,700
You stay comfortable.

593
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,700
I am comfortable.

594
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,700
Behind the red curtain.

595
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,660
I didn't realize you got this indoor jacuzzi, but I don't know why you put it on.

596
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,660
You hold it for me.

597
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,660
Oh, it's heavy.

598
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,660
Yeah.

599
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:54,340
There you go, because guess what, Wes?

600
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:57,300
It is a surprise secret Santa for Wes Payne.

601
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,300
What?

602
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,300
That's right.

603
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,300
It's a Christmas miracle.

604
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,300
What?

605
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,300
It's a Christmas miracle.

606
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,300
Ooh.

607
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:08,660
An unplugged miracle right here on the show.

608
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:12,420
So go ahead and unwrap your box and tell us what it is.

609
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:15,020
Well, first of all, it's some lovely wrapping paper.

610
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,020
Yeah.

611
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,580
I think that might be Hadia's finest, actually.

612
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,980
Yeah.

613
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,180
You got the wife's finest right there.

614
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,520
You don't have to save it.

615
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,520
You can rip into it.

616
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,180
It's fine.

617
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,180
I like that.

618
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,040
I like that.

619
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:34,540
So Wes has been a huge, huge help in the transition to Jupiter broadcasting going independent.

620
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:39,900
I thought to myself, what can I get Wes for Christmas that would convey our appreciation

621
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,580
for how damn hard he's worked for us?

622
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:46,860
And you know, I thought about and I thought pretty much nothing because I can't afford

623
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,860
to do anything.

624
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:51,700
So I thought, okay, well, what I need here.

625
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,700
Here, I got you a knife.

626
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,700
Oh, thank you.

627
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,700
You planned ahead.

628
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,020
So I was like, because, you know, I'd like to get him something, you know, something

629
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,180
to reflect the appreciation.

630
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,700
I think the audience can tell you work really hard for us.

631
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,620
And I'm sure they'd like to see you get something.

632
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:09,580
So I started thinking, well, since I can't afford anything, what I need is a Secret Santa.

633
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:14,540
So I emailed our friends over at Synology and I said, would you like to play Secret

634
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,060
Santa for Wes Payne?

635
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,060
So what you got here?

636
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:21,860
And then I think I know which one it is, but I'm not actually sure because they just sent

637
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,140
this to us.

638
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:26,380
This is a Synology for you forever.

639
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,380
It's not a review unit.

640
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:31,420
It's keeps just for you for keeps and this is definitely one I would get myself.

641
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,420
I can tell you that.

642
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,660
Oh, it's got a handle and look at this.

643
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,660
All right.

644
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,780
What's the model on the box?

645
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,780
This is the DS 920 plus.

646
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,780
Yeah.

647
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,780
Okay.

648
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,660
This is the one with a little bit more memory so you can run some services on it.

649
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,260
Scalableness for demanding environments.

650
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,900
Hey, that sounds like me.

651
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,900
Yeah.

652
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:54,300
So the DS 920 plus has a SSD cache, but also one of the things that we were talking about

653
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:58,340
is, you know, with this guy, it's got four core processor.

654
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:01,340
You can put some serious applications on this thing.

655
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,340
Yeah.

656
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:07,820
ASNI support, expandable storage in RAM and hey, two NICs on board.

657
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:08,820
Awesome.

658
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,620
Also supports running virtual machines.

659
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,620
What?

660
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,620
Yeah.

661
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,620
So you can run some VMs on it.

662
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:16,380
Because I know, you know, you haven't really decided on what you're going to do for your

663
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,380
home setup since you got in your new place.

664
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,380
And I thought...

665
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,380
That's true.

666
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,020
This simplifies things significantly.

667
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,180
And you know, I'm a self-hosting kind of guy.

668
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,500
So this just seemed...

669
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,460
You were worried about my cloud usage.

670
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,460
Yeah.

671
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,460
Yeah.

672
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:33,980
Well, Angela's had a Synology for like seven years and it has run flawlessly.

673
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,740
So I thought, you know, it'd be just enough where you could mess with it.

674
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:40,140
But also if you get busy with the day job, you're not going to have to worry about it.

675
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:43,900
It'll just sit there and run forever, you know, so it's best of both worlds.

676
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,900
Well this is amazing.

677
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,900
Isn't it great?

678
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,900
Thank you Synology.

679
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,900
Yeah.

680
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,900
Wow.

681
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,900
Fantastic.

682
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,900
It was really cool.

683
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,020
You know, it was one of those things that just worked out perfectly.

684
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,460
So there you go, Wes.

685
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,380
Merry Christmas and enjoy your new disk station.

686
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,460
It's a Christmas project.

687
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,460
What more could I ask for?

688
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,460
Yeah.

689
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,460
You know what else is?

690
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:02,660
Now when you get it going and stuff, you come back, you have to tell us how it works.

691
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,660
Deal.

692
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,100
An unplugged Christmas miracle.

693
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:10,100
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

694
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:16,660
So it was the DS920 Plus, and I think they also put a couple of disks in there too, right?

695
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,980
Oh, they did.

696
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:18,980
Thank you Synology.

697
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:23,500
They put two six terabyte Seagate IronWolf drives in there.

698
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,500
That'll get you off to a good start.

699
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,620
Yeah, right?

700
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:29,820
You know what I love about this DS920 Plus?

701
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,820
You know what I love about it?

702
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:33,760
It uses ButterFS.

703
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,340
And they're not shy about it.

704
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:38,660
Actually they've got a whole page on their website talking about the benefits of ButterFS

705
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:43,180
and how it helps make a robust product for you, which that's pretty neat.

706
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:47,180
So this thing's got four gigs of RAM, expandable up to eight gigs.

707
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:50,220
It's got two gigabit NICs on it.

708
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,420
It's got an eSATA port.

709
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:55,220
It has two USB 3.0 ports.

710
00:33:55,220 --> 00:34:00,340
I mean, this could probably last you a little while is what I was thinking, you know?

711
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,900
Yeah, that's what's nice.

712
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:05,820
It came with four gigs of RAM, but that's expandable up to eight.

713
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,780
It came with two drives, but there's four slots in there and I think you can go up to

714
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:14,220
like nine drives if you buy the Synology expansion unit, which I probably won't even need that

715
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:18,260
much because, you know, drives just keep getting bigger and bigger.

716
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:24,260
And it's got a pretty nifty little 10 watt Intel Celeron processor in there, which is

717
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:29,260
actually kind of similar to the processor I've got in my Linux powered router at home.

718
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,780
So it fits neatly into the family.

719
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,200
That's cool.

720
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,300
What's the setup process like?

721
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,900
Because you're not like hooking a screen up to this than a keyboard, right?

722
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,900
No, no.

723
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,340
You know, unboxed at night, nicely packaged in there.

724
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:44,260
The disks were actually already in the unit so I didn't have to do anything there.

725
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,260
Disks in there, locked up tight, ready to go.

726
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:49,420
So pretty much just found a spot for it, attach the power, plugged in.

727
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,780
It's got two NICs, which is awesome.

728
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:56,100
And then by default, before you've got it configured or anything, they've got a nice

729
00:34:56,100 --> 00:35:02,980
little quick connect service online, as well as a few other things like find.synology.com.

730
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:06,720
And when you first boot it up, the firmware that it starts with goes and talks to their

731
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,300
servers and sort of advertises like, hey, you've got an unconfigured Synology here.

732
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:14,000
So all you have to do is go to find.synology.com.

733
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,780
It does a little magic behind the scenes to locate where on your local network, like what's

734
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,780
the new local IP.

735
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:22,780
So you don't have to go browse to your router or do ARP scans or just ping around the network

736
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,500
to try to find where this new box is.

737
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:29,260
And then it pulls it up right for you, prompts you to upgrade, install, and then gives you

738
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:32,300
a little screen to set up your first admin user and start configuring things.

739
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,460
And it was just super painless.

740
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:39,020
I mean, I have the know-how to find things on my network or go through whatever technical

741
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:43,500
setup that I need, but just none of that was necessary all in the web browser.

742
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,540
Could you do it over SSH if you wanted though?

743
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:49,620
I don't know if you can do the setup over SSH, but once you've got it up and running,

744
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:53,180
turning on Telnet or SSH is super simple.

745
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:56,740
It doesn't feel like they're trying to hide any of the Linux underpinnings.

746
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,740
It's not like a...

747
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:03,380
Yes, it is a black box in some sense, but it just doesn't feel that way with all the

748
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:06,900
applications that are available, with all the features that are available.

749
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:10,780
Really what stood out to me was that this is clearly a robust and well-developed platform.

750
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:15,740
Yeah, I would imagine because like I mentioned, Angela's had one now for, I mean, it's got

751
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,700
to be nearly eight years actually.

752
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:26,100
And I logged into it around Thanksgiving and did an update and everything just worked.

753
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,940
I told her, I said, you know, there's got to be almost a zero chance that this thing

754
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,900
isn't going to break because nobody's touched that thing in years.

755
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:37,860
It went way too long and it just did it like a champ.

756
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,100
How's the noise level on yours?

757
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,580
Not bad so far.

758
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:46,440
I mean, my apartment's not the quietest to be clear, but they've got actual configuration

759
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,440
for that.

760
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,820
So if you don't mind a little more heat on your device, maybe that affects the length

761
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,360
of life, hard to say.

762
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:57,620
But it's all configurable in the settings, so you can set like full fans on all the time.

763
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:02,500
You can set it to a slightly louder adaptive fan mode or maximize quiet mode.

764
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,940
You can also, which is nice, so after the first night I plugged it in, going to bed,

765
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:09,940
I realized like, oh, where I've got my router, I just put it in the area I've got like my

766
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:15,860
router and my wifi and all the networking stuff, all the infrastructure you might say.

767
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:19,740
And I can almost see that bright blue LED when I'm laying in bed.

768
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,260
I was like, okay, well, maybe I'm going to have to rethink this.

769
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:27,500
But that was before I discovered you can totally configure that in the UI, no problem, from

770
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:32,280
very dim to very bright or just all the way off, which is just another little sign I think

771
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,420
of like they've been through this before, they've iterated on these platforms and they've

772
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,100
figured out a lot of what you might need.

773
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,780
That's nice, you can just turn it off even.

774
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,340
That's pretty cool.

775
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:47,720
The other part that impressed me was that, so they've got a quick connect technology

776
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:51,180
where if you have like a Synology account, they'll run a proxy for you.

777
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:55,060
You can log in there and then, you know, discover your Synology, go talk to it without having

778
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,940
to actually forward ports on your network.

779
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:01,340
You know, kind of common these days, but a nice service to have if you just don't want

780
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:05,660
to expose your home network or don't have that technical know how.

781
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:11,640
But if you don't want that, they've also got automation in place to talk to all kinds of

782
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,960
different router brands and firmware.

783
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,920
So first it checks to see if you've got UPnP enabled and it'll try to forward ports that

784
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,540
way if you don't do a quick connect thing.

785
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:25,300
But if you don't do that, you can choose your router brand and then it's going to go like,

786
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,360
you give it your credentials.

787
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:30,340
It logs in and basically goes through the web UI or APIs if they have them and sets

788
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,340
up its port forwards.

789
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:34,540
And then if that doesn't work, they've got online documentation with a whole bunch of

790
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:37,540
router information for various brands about how to do it too.

791
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:41,900
So it's kind of neat that they've got robust security support and upgrades and monitoring

792
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:47,060
situations, SNMP support for instance, if you're running this in a business environment.

793
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:51,700
And they've got helpers for your mom or dad who needs help getting it exposed so they

794
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,380
can go see it when they're visiting you.

795
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:56,700
You know, I kind of was chuckling when you were talking about it because I'm like, oh,

796
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,480
I wonder how it handled your custom Linux router.

797
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:05,560
But then I was thinking, but also being able to do that means that my mom could buy one

798
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,500
of these and she could stop paying for cloud storage and she could have it right there

799
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:13,380
at her house because she works with large graphics files and it's a constant challenge

800
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,960
for her.

801
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,060
But I also, while I could go over and set it up, I really would like getting her something

802
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,100
that she could just do herself.

803
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,180
I think she'd feel more empowered by that too.

804
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:27,780
How did it handle, so with your setup, you just open up any ports you want or choose

805
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,780
not to.

806
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,580
I mean, you don't probably even need to bother with that, I would imagine.

807
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,580
Yeah.

808
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,620
I mean, it kind of depends on how you do, you know, your setup.

809
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:37,140
Some folks just have a VPN and then VPN back to their house or you can forward things.

810
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,700
So far I've not forwarded it because I don't know that I need to.

811
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,660
I've got a couple other gateways on my router box.

812
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,740
So for right now it just lives totally on my land.

813
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:49,380
I think I will try the quick connect stuff just to give it a go.

814
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:52,920
I could also see in the future where maybe some of those applications and services move

815
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,440
over to the Synology, like it becomes the VPN host and maybe that's when you'd change

816
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,660
some of the firewall rules.

817
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,660
Yes.

818
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:06,180
That's also pretty neat because it's got both support for virtualization and running Docker.

819
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:12,500
So I loaded up a Fedora 33 box on there to give that a shot and it just pops open a VNC

820
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,860
window right in your web browser too.

821
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:16,240
So it was really easy to get that configured.

822
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:21,440
And then on the Docker side of things, I got Jellyfin going, I loaded up a couple of media

823
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,540
files to test things out and it worked no problem.

824
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:28,820
I mean, the CPU in there is not like a beast or anything, but it has a nice balance of

825
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:33,260
power usage to performance and it was totally fine for like just me playing back on my local

826
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,260
network.

827
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,260
I don't think it was enabled.

828
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:38,420
It didn't have the configuration, but that model even has quick sync.

829
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,420
No way.

830
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,420
Yeah.

831
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,420
Right?

832
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,420
Oh, man.

833
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:47,980
So we're just talking about that on self-hosted and that's a big game changer, not just in

834
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:53,340
terms of CPU overhead, but a lot less power usage too by the CPU when you're using quick

835
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,340
sync.

836
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,580
I'm legit jealous.

837
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,580
That's awesome.

838
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,580
I'm really glad.

839
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,580
I'm glad.

840
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,580
It sounds like a really nice rig.

841
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:02,780
So what you should do is use it for a little while and then we should do long-term reviews

842
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:07,460
because I'm going to try to do a long-term review with the X1 and I'd love to hear a

843
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,260
long-term review for your Synology.

844
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,260
Yeah, definitely.

845
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,580
I've actually got a few more spare drives around.

846
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:15,700
So this was really just a test setup, sort of evaluate things, put it through its paces

847
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:19,860
before I committed to a particular setup because they've got a lot of different sort of like

848
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:23,300
integrated volume and storage pool options even before you choose if you're going to

849
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,940
use ButterFS or EXT4.

850
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:28,780
So I'm going to play with that a little bit more, maybe install two more drives just to

851
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:33,100
fill the thing out and then, yeah, I'm going to move over from my previous solution, which

852
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,040
definitely needed an upgrade.

853
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,540
So thank you, Chris, and thank you, Synology.

854
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,540
All right.

855
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:41,660
It is time for the Tuxes.

856
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:46,360
Ladies and gentlemen, the first annual Linux Unplugged Tuxes.

857
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:51,300
Our audience voted on the best open source newcomers, projects of the year, text editors

858
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,300
and more.

859
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:58,600
And it's our chance after a real ball buster of a year to say thank you.

860
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,540
The Unplugged Tuxes 2020.

861
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:07,140
We had a total of 221 submissions, which I love that number because having done some

862
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,860
submission challenges before, that's a decent turnout.

863
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:13,860
So you can get a kind of somewhat representative sampling.

864
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:16,940
But I hope that we will crush it next year.

865
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,820
I hope we get like 800 submissions next year.

866
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:21,900
And then I want to, I'd like, you know, every year I'd like us to double the number because

867
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,820
I really would love this to eventually be representative.

868
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:29,060
But we put out a form for a few weeks and we said, tell us who you think is the best

869
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,740
in these categories.

870
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:37,780
And the results have been tabulated and we're going to run through the categories and then

871
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,640
their winners.

872
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:44,980
And of course, your hosts do reserve the right to challenge a result.

873
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:50,900
But we will have to make our case in a court of a public opinion and to Drew, who is here

874
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:51,900
to play arbiter.

875
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:52,900
Hello, Drew.

876
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:53,900
Welcome back.

877
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:54,900
Hello.

878
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,940
And so we could, if we want to challenge one of the results, we have to make our case and

879
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:00,540
then the other hosts have to buy off on it.

880
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:05,960
But here are the categories for 2020, ladies and gentlemen.

881
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:09,140
Number one, the best open source project.

882
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:13,000
Number two, best newcomer project.

883
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,060
Number three, best Linux game of the year.

884
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:20,040
Number four, best text editor of 2020.

885
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:23,140
Number five, favorite desktop distro of 2020.

886
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:26,320
Number six, favorite server distro of 2020.

887
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:31,620
Number seven, best desktop environment of 2020, and these are all of 2020.

888
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:33,500
Then we'll just do a general best of tech.

889
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:39,400
And then we asked you all what your most life changing hardware or gadget was this year.

890
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:46,300
We've tabulated the results and we'll go through them and let you know what everyone voted.

891
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:49,980
So we'll start with, why don't we start with the best text editor?

892
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:52,000
Because I think that's a good place to start.

893
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,380
So get the divisive one right out of the way.

894
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,380
Yeah.

895
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,020
That's the elephant in the room.

896
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:01,100
And this is the one that I think maybe we even want to contest right off the beginning,

897
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:08,240
but with 53 entries out of 208 answers for this category, 25% thus the winner went to

898
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:12,620
Vim, Vim.

899
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:18,300
And there was a couple of runner ups in this category, VS Code came in at number two, Emacs

900
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:22,280
at number three, VS Code beat Emacs.

901
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:28,780
And if you include the VS Codium votes, VS Code handily beat Emacs.

902
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:35,180
26 submissions for Emacs, 29 for just VS Code alone, but then there were additional five

903
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:38,500
submissions for VS Codium.

904
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,620
Kate's in the list.

905
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:41,660
But Wes, what do you think here?

906
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:45,140
Do you think Vim actually maybe performed better than the numbers suggest?

907
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,140
Well, yeah.

908
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:50,100
I mean, there's also Neo Vim in there and some entries for VI.

909
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:56,540
So I think its lead would be even stronger if we had done a little more assertive tallying,

910
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:57,540
you know.

911
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:00,460
I did do a little cleanup here to try to make things fit into nice categories where there

912
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:04,660
were some, you know, a lot of fun comments that people wrote in, which was awesome.

913
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:11,100
Like one of my favorites for this entry is we got one vote for LibreOfficeWriter.

914
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:18,380
We got some votes for Sublime Text and Kate and Micro and GEdit and Mousepad and KWrite.

915
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:19,380
Didn't get much.

916
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:24,140
Only 0.95% of the vote for KWrite, which I've been using recently.

917
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:28,300
Vim, though, I feel like it handily wins.

918
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:32,620
I was going to try to make the case for VS Code, but even when you combine the VS Code

919
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:37,380
with the VS Codium, I think Vim still won pretty strong by the audience.

920
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:40,300
I mean, it's a pretty strong lead there.

921
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,300
I don't really think I'm going to challenge this one.

922
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:46,160
I feel like Vim is a little boring.

923
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:52,920
So there is a trick in place to solve this problem, and it'll be employed if Vim ever

924
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,280
wins again.

925
00:45:54,280 --> 00:46:00,880
And then they just get, if they win two shows in a row, they'll get the Hall of Fame award

926
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,660
and they are disqualified from winning in a future show.

927
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,740
But we could give it to Vim this year, but that means if they win it next year, then

928
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:09,180
they win the Lifetime Award and they're out.

929
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:14,580
Well, I also think that VS Code, you know, edging out Emacs, that's something to watch,

930
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:15,580
right?

931
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:18,980
One, that's a good idea because we just, you know, we should mix things up, keep it interesting.

932
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:23,500
But then two, I think on its own, probably next year, VS Code is going to be doing better

933
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,100
against Vim, not worse.

934
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:30,380
Also, what's up to my Nano brothers and sisters out there, solid representation from the Nano

935
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:31,380
community.

936
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:33,380
I mean, could have used a few more of you.

937
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:35,140
All right, I'm not going to challenge this one.

938
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:43,980
We will award the first Tuxy of 2020 for Best Text Editor to Vim.

939
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:46,040
Congratulations to Vim, you've earned it.

940
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,900
Now our plan here is, of course, I still got to get my crap together and I could use some

941
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:54,060
help if anybody could help me figure out how to take a two dimensional graphic, a flat

942
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:58,300
graphic and convert that into a 3D printable object.

943
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:04,980
Somebody's actually done it before, but I want to take the last bearded penguin and

944
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:08,220
I want to take the ring around him that we have where he's holding the rocket and the

945
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:12,240
ring around it, I want it to say 2020 Tuxys and I want to print that and send that out

946
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,820
to the award winners.

947
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:15,180
So that's a bit of an effort.

948
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:16,900
So I need to figure out how to do that.

949
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:20,180
Alex has volunteered to do the printing, though, which is awesome.

950
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:23,060
And then we'll just have to start tracking down the projects and figure out where to

951
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:24,060
send this.

952
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:26,860
And Vim, you're going to be one of the first.

953
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:29,940
Now we get into the more interesting category.

954
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:34,200
This one I think is, I don't know, this one's going to be challenged, I think.

955
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:38,060
This is the best open source project in 2020.

956
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:44,460
And with 7% of the votes, wow, this is really spread out, but with 15 out of 217 submissions

957
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:51,300
for this category, the winner for the community is the Linux kernel.

958
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:54,540
I like to stretch it out a little bit.

959
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:58,580
The Linux kernel, and the reason why I'm a little hesitant with this one is it feels

960
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:01,820
kind of boring in a way.

961
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:07,380
But I actually think maybe it's appropriate at the same time that for our first Tuxys,

962
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:10,340
maybe it should go to the Linux kernel, you know?

963
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:13,360
You know, I mean, there was, Debian was a runner up here.

964
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,760
But then after that, things got a little more interesting.

965
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,420
Things like Nextcloud and Firefox were also high up on the list.

966
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:24,700
Yeah, I'm disappointed that it wasn't Home Assistant, I have to be honest with you.

967
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:29,220
I think Home Assistant is just not a, it's just people don't appreciate how awesome it

968
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:30,460
is, man.

969
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:37,420
But really, you know, we can talk about text editors and stuff, but Home Assistant has

970
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:38,720
changed my life.

971
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,140
It's made my quality of life better.

972
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:44,660
My particular living situation, heating, can be challenging.

973
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:50,540
And having an automation system that has managed that has made this winter and last winter

974
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:52,980
more comfortable than I've ever been in LadyJuice.

975
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:58,440
And then I combine that with a bunch of smart lighting that makes it much nicer and cozier

976
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:03,780
and tolerable when it gets dark out at 3.55 p.m. in the Pacific Northwest, I have a bunch

977
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:07,340
of lighting that comes on automatically that tracks the sunset and sunrise.

978
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:12,120
So it's always adjusting with the sunlight of the time of year and it monitors the weather

979
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:17,600
for me and it brings together so many aspects of automation, even security aspects that

980
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:22,300
when you start to use a project like Home Assistant, it actually changes your day to

981
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,300
day life.

982
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:28,540
And it changes how my family interacts with my home and how they interact with technology

983
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:31,020
and what their perceptions of what it's capable of.

984
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:36,800
And it has bridged all of these commercial cloud connected products all together in one

985
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:43,660
local LAN based system that has a nice, easy to use dashboard.

986
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:45,980
It's very family tolerable.

987
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:50,180
But I understand that it's it even spent a good portion as the number one project on

988
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:51,820
GitHub in 2020.

989
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:55,420
That's why I really thought maybe it had a shot at the best open source project.

990
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:59,660
So that's why I'm a little I'm tempted to challenge this one.

991
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:04,180
But when you stack that up to the impact of the Linux kernel, I don't think I can argue

992
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:05,180
that.

993
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:06,620
You know, they clearly are.

994
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:10,580
They've had a little more impact than a single open source project, regardless of the personal

995
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:11,580
impact it's had on me.

996
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:16,180
Yeah, you are in a particularly automatable setup, I think, right?

997
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:19,860
I mean, you have some different needs, you have a very changing environment, you have

998
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,940
a custom setup.

999
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:26,500
But having watched Home Assistant rise the past few years, I mean, I remember we did

1000
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:33,700
a comparison with OpenHAB and a couple other stuff here on LUP in I don't know, 2017, maybe.

1001
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:36,460
And back then it was kind of like, well, what's, you know, there's a couple of solutions out

1002
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:37,740
here in the market.

1003
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:41,540
They're all pretty decent, but don't you know, not everyone supports everything.

1004
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:43,500
And that's just totally changed.

1005
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,820
I mean, Home Assistant is king now.

1006
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:52,660
Also the Home Assistant project has come across what may be a uniquely great, sustainable

1007
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:55,300
profit model for an open source project.

1008
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:58,060
So Home Assistant is all land based.

1009
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:02,740
But if you would like for like less than $10 a month, I think it's like $8 a month, you

1010
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:07,460
can subscribe to Nebuchadnezzar's Home Assistant cloud service.

1011
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:13,780
And that gives you secure remote access through their proxy system to your Home Assistant

1012
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:14,780
instance.

1013
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:20,740
And it works even with some crazy double carrier grade NAT system like I have.

1014
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:25,780
And it also allows for easy tie in with the smart cylinders if you want.

1015
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:30,060
You can also custom build this stuff so you don't have to use the cloud service if you're

1016
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:33,700
comfortable with setting up your own cloud service yourself and you want to manage all

1017
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:38,060
of it and you want to manually connect to the different APIs, you can do all of this

1018
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:39,060
yourself.

1019
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:43,420
But they give you just a couple of checkboxes for like $8 a month that does all of this

1020
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:45,080
stuff.

1021
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:50,980
And on top of that, they give you a kind of like this peace of mind because you can now

1022
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:55,780
check in on like your system itself, the health of your system remotely, which is great.

1023
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:59,460
You know, so anyways, that then goes into funding the developers.

1024
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:04,780
And now they've hired eight full time people at Nebuchadnezzar who are contributing back

1025
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:09,060
to Home Assistant with the sole purpose of making Home Assistant better.

1026
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:14,380
So that way they can pick up a few more subscribers and it just kind of is a really nice, sustainable

1027
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:19,260
development model where you're not the product, but they also have found a way to give something

1028
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:22,780
away that's extremely intricate and a lot of work.

1029
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:24,520
It's an intense amount of work.

1030
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:30,180
They've figured out a way to give that away for free, absolutely free, while also funding

1031
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:34,820
the people who love to work on it and give them full time work that keeps the project

1032
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:35,820
going.

1033
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:41,980
I just think that's something really special and the way they've grown over 2020 is extremely,

1034
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:44,880
it's just, it's an open source success story.

1035
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:49,580
They've had a groundswell of support from people out in the whole world that are developing

1036
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:50,820
these integrations.

1037
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:56,220
The core team has come together under some pretty clear and I'd say concise leadership.

1038
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:59,780
They've had a couple of missteps here and there with community communication, but then

1039
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:04,840
they listened to the feedback in both instances and righted the ship in a significant way

1040
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:08,980
that actually made a difference and addressed the complaints the community was making and

1041
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:10,940
they pulled that off.

1042
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:17,260
It's such an open source success story, but when people don't try it, even if you have

1043
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:21,100
a simple home automation system, you maybe have one or two smart plugs or a light bulb,

1044
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:23,700
so maybe you don't try it, you don't get to see it.

1045
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:27,740
I understand that's why it isn't represented here in the votes, but as someone who has

1046
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:33,700
watched open source projects and developments for a long time, it's so great to see something

1047
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:37,140
like that happening in 2020.

1048
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:43,340
It frees me from proprietary lockdown cloud services and it lets me have a higher quality

1049
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:45,500
standard of living in my home.

1050
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:51,100
It's that kind of project, but again, all that said, I can't argue that the Linux kernel

1051
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:53,020
has been more impactful in this year.

1052
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:55,660
It's just the math of it.

1053
00:53:55,660 --> 00:54:01,820
I don't think I can overrule it, but I wonder, Drew and Wes, you guys, feel free, but do

1054
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:06,660
you think, what about an honorary best open source project of the year?

1055
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:12,900
Well, I think it can absolutely get something like the crisp pick of the year, but considering

1056
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:20,360
that it's tied for sixth, I have a hard time saying this particular project needs a special

1057
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:25,900
award from the whole group when there are so many other projects that are above it that

1058
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:28,380
really are hugely impactful too.

1059
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:33,300
We're not just talking about the Linux kernel, which obviously is hugely impactful to all

1060
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,060
of our day-to-day lives.

1061
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:43,900
There's also Debian and Nextcloud, both of which are huge and touch a lot of people.

1062
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:50,180
Then there's Firefox and KDE, and then Home Assistant is tied with Fedora.

1063
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:58,860
All of these are huge projects that really have massive contributions to our world.

1064
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:06,220
So I'd say make a new category for a crisp pick, but respect the will of the voters.

1065
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,220
It's down there, isn't it?

1066
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,940
It's down in the votes.

1067
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:09,940
That's the math of it.

1068
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:14,900
I'll just give it, I'll just say, unofficial appreciation to the project.

1069
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:16,660
I think you guys can tell why I appreciate it.

1070
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:17,660
You're right.

1071
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:19,740
You're right.

1072
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:21,740
It is what it is.

1073
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:22,980
But how does this not happen next year?

1074
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:24,820
Linux kernel wins again next year could be a problem.

1075
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:26,860
Well, didn't you make the rule for this already?

1076
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:28,040
If they win again, then...

1077
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,020
If they win again, lifetime achievement award.

1078
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:33,360
It almost seems like they should just get one, but no, we'll see, we'll see.

1079
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,360
You never know.

1080
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:35,380
2021 could be crazy.

1081
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:39,140
So I'll just say this, thank you to Home Assistant.

1082
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:44,820
You are my arbitrary appreciation pick of the show.

1083
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:47,460
And you get a little love explosion right there.

1084
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:52,360
Okay, let's step into a territory that until just a couple of weeks ago was not very controversial

1085
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:59,220
at all, but thanks to recent changes with CentOS and people are still adjusting as we

1086
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:05,560
record this, the favorite server distro of 2020 results might be a little more interesting

1087
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,300
than we were expecting.

1088
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:12,460
And we had not as many people submit this category, but we got 208 submissions here

1089
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:16,300
and we had a winner, a pretty clear signal on this one.

1090
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:22,580
The community voted with 40% of the vote to give it to Ubuntu.

1091
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:31,880
Yeah, Ubuntu got it with 84 votes out of 208, followed by Debian in second place and CentOS

1092
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:39,660
in third place, Fedora in fourth, Red Hat Enterprise 9 in fifth, and there's OpenSUSE

1093
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:44,620
just above arch at sixth place with six votes.

1094
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:47,180
You know what's interesting about this, Wes?

1095
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:51,420
Doesn't this kind of track close to what the actual web server market share stats are that

1096
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:52,420
we looked up?

1097
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:53,740
Yeah, it kind of seems like it, right?

1098
00:56:53,740 --> 00:57:00,340
I mean, Ubuntu is way up there at the top and probably rightfully so, it's just a trusted

1099
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:04,640
server platform these days with a lot of niceties, all the software you could want and a good

1100
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:05,640
track record.

1101
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:10,140
Oh, the orange one says that an honorary mention should go to Alpine for being pretty much

1102
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:13,320
all of the Docker containers out there that are getting used.

1103
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,320
That's a good one.

1104
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:15,320
Good point, orange one.

1105
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:20,460
I actually am a little surprised Ubuntu is this far ahead in our crowd.

1106
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:24,320
I actually don't doubt the numbers at all, but I think it shows you this is reflective

1107
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,980
of what the audience is out there running.

1108
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:27,980
Manjaro came in at two.

1109
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:29,660
Now remember, this is a server.

1110
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:32,940
Unraid with one vote, Void Linux is on there.

1111
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:36,660
I don't think, oh yeah, Alpine did get two votes.

1112
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:39,620
So Alpine did get some representation.

1113
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:43,420
Although that was the same number as the folks who decided to still answer, but write in

1114
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:45,780
I don't have any servers.

1115
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:47,180
Yeah, right.

1116
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:48,180
That's fair enough.

1117
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:49,180
Fair enough.

1118
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:51,460
So are you guys okay with officially giving that one to Ubuntu?

1119
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:52,780
I don't see any reason not to.

1120
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:54,620
I mean, the people have spoken.

1121
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:57,500
I think it makes perfect sense, yeah.

1122
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,020
They've worked hard on that LTS.

1123
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:02,660
And at this point, you don't get fired for choosing Ubuntu.

1124
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:10,520
All right, then Ubuntu gets our official 2020 Tuxy as the server distro of the year, which

1125
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:13,700
means we move on now to the desktop.

1126
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:18,980
So favorite desktop distribution, not desktop environment, but desktop distribution.

1127
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:22,540
This one got a 19% winning vote.

1128
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:25,580
There's 219 submissions for this category.

1129
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:34,260
And the winner for the favorite desktop distro of 2020 is Fedora with 43 out of 219 votes.

1130
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:35,260
How about that?

1131
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:38,980
Ubuntu wins the server, but doesn't win the desktop this year.

1132
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:39,980
Isn't that interesting?

1133
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:43,940
Fedora gets 43 votes, and Ubuntu gets 29 votes.

1134
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:49,820
Manjaro coming in at a solid third with 25, and Arch right after that, followed by PopOS

1135
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:50,820
and then KDE Neon.

1136
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:51,820
Yeah, after PopOS.

1137
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:55,820
I mean, there's kind of a close little running for the second-third category this year.

1138
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:56,820
It's interesting.

1139
00:58:56,820 --> 00:59:02,340
MX and OpenSUSE and Solus and Mint all kind of fighting for the same territory.

1140
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:05,620
Zubuntu, Kubuntu, and Budgie and Monte, et cetera.

1141
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:10,660
All of those, we put those down as not Ubuntu the primary, but one of the derivatives of

1142
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:13,260
Ubuntu got nine votes.

1143
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:18,940
So if you added the nine votes for all of the Ubuntu derivatives, Ubuntu looks a little

1144
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:23,180
bit better, but Fedora actually still wins, even when you add in all of the derivatives

1145
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:27,140
to the results for Ubuntu.

1146
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:31,340
It's a stronger second place, but Fedora is still a winner there.

1147
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:35,140
So that's a clear vote for Fedora.

1148
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:38,340
I can't really think of any reason to challenge that.

1149
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:40,340
Honestly not what I expected.

1150
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:45,740
I expected Ubuntu and Fedora to be swapped, that Ubuntu would be in first place and Fedora

1151
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:46,740
would be in second place.

1152
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:51,500
I'm just a little bit happy because I feel like it validates some of the fawning we've

1153
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,500
been doing over at Fedora lately.

1154
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,980
Maybe or maybe we've just pissed off all the Ubuntu users.

1155
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:58,460
That also could be it.

1156
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:00,380
Well Fedora did have a great year.

1157
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:02,740
They're shipping on laptops from Lenovo.

1158
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:07,740
I mean they had Fedora 33 release, has been stellar.

1159
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:10,740
There's a lot to really like in Fedora this year.

1160
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:16,180
Yeah that's true and Fedora 33 got a lot of recognition for pushing the envelope and I

1161
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:22,100
think you can attribute a lot of that to the switch of ButterFS as the default.

1162
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:24,860
You've got to be pretty happy about these results here Neil.

1163
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:28,220
Oh my goodness yeah I'm super happy about this.

1164
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:36,620
I honestly didn't expect it given how much I tend to hear how Ubuntu is the way of the

1165
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:44,420
beast or whatever but like holy crap I'm blown away and I know and I feel like maybe some

1166
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:49,980
of what I've done over the past year might have helped tilt things in our favor but I

1167
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:52,620
don't know what to say except for like thank you?

1168
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:57,900
Well and I think the switch to ButterFS and the project also you know they took a couple

1169
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:01,420
of other bold steps like switching to Nano as a default editor in some instances you

1170
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:04,820
know bold steps Neil that made a big change.

1171
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:08,780
It's fun too to still see all this cool stuff happening in 2020.

1172
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:14,220
It's been kind of a weird year and so to see to see these shift around I'm really going

1173
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:16,540
to be interested to see if Fedora wins again next year.

1174
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:18,820
I wouldn't necessarily bet on it.

1175
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:22,540
Well I'm going to try hard to you know you know within the Fedora community me and many

1176
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:27,560
others will try our best to try to earn the vote for next year as well and also keep an

1177
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:32,540
eye on Fedora server that's coming back in a hopefully in a big way next year.

1178
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:37,420
So hey Wes do a little back of the napkin math for me before we fully lock this in because

1179
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:39,820
we haven't locked it in yet.

1180
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:49,220
If we took all of the Ubuntu derivatives and we took Pop OS does that put Ubuntu ahead?

1181
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:52,900
Are we counting KDE Neon in here?

1182
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:58,420
Well hmm see the reason why we separated these out is I actually wanted to get a signal to

1183
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:03,020
people like the stock Ubuntu desktop or do they like the derivative desktops.

1184
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:05,540
So I actually think this is the vote result that I wanted.

1185
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:10,740
I wanted to know and it is clear by these numbers that the stock Ubuntu desktop is the

1186
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:16,460
most popular but on its own it isn't the most popular in our audience.

1187
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:22,540
Yeah so if you add up all the ones not including some controversial things like like KDE Neon

1188
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:26,780
or other things that might be vaguely based on Ubuntu but actually like Ubuntu MATE,

1189
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:33,580
Zubuntu, things like that it's a four vote margin so it's pretty darn close 43 to 39

1190
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:36,100
but Fedora is still in the lead.

1191
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:41,260
Okay yeah and then if you add in Pop OS it's kind of a it's kind of a smash and then if

1192
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:46,960
you add in KDE Neon on top of that as yet another derivative it's Ubuntu is far and

1193
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,580
away the most but.

1194
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:52,980
And elementary if you put elementary in there which only got three votes in this in this

1195
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:58,340
lineup but you know that's still three votes and yeah you really you could if you combine

1196
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:03,980
all of the derivatives which I think you could argue is fair but it's not the signal we wanted

1197
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:04,980
from the audience.

1198
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:10,980
We wanted to know how many people were using the stock experience.

1199
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:13,740
I don't know what do you think Drew what's your what's your judgment on it?

1200
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:15,900
Oh I think it's still Fedora.

1201
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:22,420
I think if we wanted to categorize you know the base OS that would be a different category

1202
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:23,420
altogether.

1203
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:27,980
All right so I think we're good then we're agreed we're gonna lock it in for Fedora as

1204
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:34,940
the best desktop distro of 2020 as voted by the audience.

1205
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:41,180
It is locked in so let's wander off into the best tech land the best tech of 2020 as voted

1206
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:43,900
by the Linux Unplugged audience.

1207
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:50,500
This one got a hundred and fifty five submissions and the winner with eight percent of the vote

1208
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:53,820
which actually isn't a significant number but it's enough to make it the winner it is

1209
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:57,740
ladies and gentlemen the PinePhone.

1210
01:03:57,740 --> 01:04:04,620
The PinePhone was voted as a best tech of 2020 in our audience and that out beat the

1211
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:11,660
Raspberry Pi 4 and Home Assistant which got somebody included in this count so Home Assistant

1212
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:14,460
got a few more votes over in this category.

1213
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:17,060
It's well represented across the board I will say.

1214
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:24,260
And Librem 5 is in here too but only two votes so the PinePhone got 13 votes in this category

1215
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:28,380
followed by the Raspberry Pi and then WireGuard.

1216
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:30,500
Yeah I could see that I could definitely see that.

1217
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:37,060
PineBook Pro got five votes Apple's M1 got four votes interesting interesting.

1218
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:41,820
That stood out to me you know in multiple categories including the next one there were

1219
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:46,940
a lot of references to the M1 although an entertaining number also included sorry I

1220
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:48,980
know it's not really Linux.

1221
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:53,500
We want it we didn't we specifically did not limit the category it did not have to be Linux

1222
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:58,100
I just wanted to know so that way we could get a sense of where things fit get a get

1223
01:04:58,100 --> 01:04:59,100
a sense.

1224
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:03,420
So what do you think PinePhone that seems I mean 13 votes is a pretty clear signal.

1225
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:09,060
I think people are excited about you know this this open hardware run whatever you want

1226
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:12,660
embrace Linux on the phone potential maybe maybe it's not the thing that you're running

1227
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:17,020
as your daily driver in 2020 but it's the thing that you have as your second phone that

1228
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:18,860
you're playing with and excited about.

1229
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:25,180
Now I do have to bring up one thing here and that is the Raspberry Pi 4 versus the Raspberry

1230
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:33,700
Pi 400 combined those two equal up to 14 which just barely edges out the PinePhone.

1231
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:42,900
Yeah but I feel like because they are separate products I think I think that is okay.

1232
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:50,500
Yeah that's a good one I don't know though yeah okay I feel like probably that's a little

1233
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:55,140
bit of cheating though because that you know the Pi 4 came out almost like a year before

1234
01:05:55,140 --> 01:06:01,540
the 400 and the 400 isn't exactly the same it's got a revved CPU and a different board

1235
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:05,820
so not really they're not really the same product they're the same platform.

1236
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:11,300
Yeah and I buy that although that said how many revisions of the PinePhone have there

1237
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,300
been.

1238
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:13,300
Fair.

1239
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:19,100
Now remember we're also we're looking at 2020 here and I think the PinePhone has had

1240
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:23,860
a they like they met their ship windows they got the devices out into people's hands and

1241
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:29,340
we've seen a lot of open source projects just in 2020 alone spin up development on these

1242
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:33,180
things and make it actually getting towards usable.

1243
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:37,460
Yeah I think I'm with you there and it's also worth pointing out that it's not just the

1244
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:42,940
PinePhone that's on here Pine64 in general is all over this list you've got the Pinebook

1245
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:50,780
Pro Pine64 as a company you know there's PineSil.

1246
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:54,780
Pine is all over this people are really excited about Pine this year.

1247
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:59,700
True true good to see OBS is in here Plasma got in here I actually really like to see

1248
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:07,780
that YouTube DL made it in here as well only one submission for Best Tech for Rust.

1249
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:11,260
Podman that must have been you Carl.

1250
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:18,300
That's awesome yeah Plasma got a KDE and Plasma were in here as two separate things.

1251
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:23,180
Yeah one thing ZFS was stood out in this too I don't think it made to the top of any of

1252
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:27,700
these but it was held had a healthy number of votes in several categories this year.

1253
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:31,580
Yeah it was nice to see Matrix and Blender and Docker all kind of in the and Nextcloud

1254
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:36,980
all kind of in the same region too all of them getting three votes.

1255
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:41,780
So this is obviously a challenging category because it's so broad and the submissions

1256
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:50,120
could be kind of variable and you know PinePhone, PineSpacePhone, Pine64Phone like a lot of variability

1257
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:55,460
to it so that's one of the things we'll refine next year but this is after taking several

1258
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:59,840
passes at trying to account for all of that and I think that you know the PinePhone still

1259
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:05,220
kind of comes out strong when you look at what has been accomplished not just by Pine64

1260
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:08,980
but the community around it too so I say we lock it in gentlemen.

1261
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:11,980
Pull that trigger.

1262
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:17,740
All right now we move on to the most life-changing hardware or device or gadget for you this

1263
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:19,740
year out there in the audience.

1264
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:28,280
This one had 142 submissions and with 11% of the vote we have a winner the Jupiter Broadcasting

1265
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:36,420
audience Linux Unplugged Tuxi nominations go to the Raspberry Pi 4 and there you go

1266
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:38,020
they just win the next category.

1267
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:42,940
The Raspberry Pi 4 has been the most life-changing hardware for 2020 or gadget.

1268
01:08:42,940 --> 01:08:46,560
See if this is your vindication Chris you know you didn't get the Home Assistant thing

1269
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,900
before but I think I think this one.

1270
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:55,660
That's true this has been this is I'm really kind of I'm just as all in on the Raspberry

1271
01:08:55,660 --> 01:09:01,660
Pi's as I was when they first launched I mean it's really been great because on the desktop

1272
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:06,340
side Manjaro has been the way I've gone on the desktop and then same with the Pi 400

1273
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:13,220
Manjaro worked great on there and on the server side Ubuntu LTS 2004 has been exactly like

1274
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:18,940
running it on an x86 box and with the USB disk support so I'm not using SD storage I

1275
01:09:18,940 --> 01:09:24,860
can unlock a lot more performance out of a Raspberry Pi 4 and I have gone off-grid many

1276
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:31,240
times running off just lithium-powered batteries and the power draw matters so much in that

1277
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:39,340
circumstance and I literally sleep well knowing that I just have these Pi's two of them now

1278
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:43,780
that are just sucking just a tiny bit of power you know it's not like an x86 machine that's

1279
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:50,860
pulling down 120 watts and it has made it possible for me to do things like go out and

1280
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:56,420
camp in the woods for longer periods of time because they are using less power and that's

1281
01:09:56,420 --> 01:10:02,500
awesome and it's it allows us to go off-grid and still have essentially a full online experience

1282
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:07,700
I talked about this and self-hosted but I have a lot of local media and reading and

1283
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:16,180
audio and some wiki stuff cached locally on my Raspberry Pi's and we very much have like

1284
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:21,860
a near online experience when we go offline but we're not getting notifications and messages

1285
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:26,420
all of our smart controls still works home assistant running on the Raspberry Pi all

1286
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:30,820
of our video streaming still works because the media stored there locally on a butter

1287
01:10:30,820 --> 01:10:36,780
FS volume of two USB disks it actually all works and this is also where I started to

1288
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:42,900
really kind of reevaluate butter FS again when I was like looking at the use case of

1289
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:49,060
laptop servers and Raspberry Pi servers and no longer these massive chassis with eight

1290
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:54,100
disks in them but now something that's running over maybe a USB but USB bus or even on SD

1291
01:10:54,100 --> 01:11:00,420
card or or some other less than ideal scenario and I realized there's a real need for a flexible

1292
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:06,860
powerful file system out there in a serious workload capacity and when I brought butter

1293
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:14,820
FS together with the Raspberry Pi 4 using Ubuntu LTS 2004 when when that like trifecta

1294
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:20,100
of Linux technology came together I was able to up my home hosting game to a whole other

1295
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:26,140
level and the Raspberry Pi has dutifully been running for me 24 7 and I even took him down

1296
01:11:26,140 --> 01:11:33,140
into Texas where the ambient temperature outside was 117 degrees and they're inside a tiny

1297
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:39,340
enclosed booth often never even getting below 100 degrees at night inside the booth and

1298
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:45,940
they I brought them back they're still running they they ran and they they they one time

1299
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:50,580
one time I ran into some thermal throttling issues one time when we were streaming multiple

1300
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:56,500
videos from a Pi 4 but now that we're back in the Pacific Northwest it's a literal non-issue

1301
01:11:56,500 --> 01:12:02,460
it really is a solid machine and then you know you look at the price and you look at

1302
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:08,180
what you get it it just it's it's so awesome that that tech of is available to us as consumers

1303
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:15,780
when when the world is dominated by $1,000 Macbooks and $10,000 desktops and all these

1304
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:21,700
crazy things it's really nice to be able to find a computer for $35 that can do so much

1305
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:25,460
and this year they upgraded it to eight gigs of RAM to really the buying is better than

1306
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:31,140
ever you can use it for more things and this wasn't even it didn't even need conflation

1307
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:37,740
with the Raspberry Pi 400 to win this category because it's just regardless it's so darn

1308
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:44,060
handy the pine phone also got submissions here so to the ThinkPad system 76 got three

1309
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:48,420
votes in this category home assistant got another three votes here as well I noticed

1310
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:53,540
you skipped right over to the Apple watch though yeah so that's the awkward thing about

1311
01:12:53,540 --> 01:13:00,780
this category the Apple watch got seven votes the Apple watch is actually our number two

1312
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:07,320
life-changing tech of the year and I think I can understand why it was a year of work

1313
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:12,040
from home and people needed help probably with their fitness more than ever remembering

1314
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:18,100
to stand tracking what they're doing tracking their sleep the Apple watch is just simply

1315
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:23,780
the best wearable computer watch if you want a computer watch that is modern and well-built

1316
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:28,420
and has great battery life you know you can find die-hards out there that are they're

1317
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:34,460
still rockin all the other kinds of watches but the Apple watch is just taking off this

1318
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:40,180
year so I really last couple years I don't know is it had a particularly great 2020 I

1319
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:44,580
mean must have it got a lot of votes and and this is on this is from a Linux audience right

1320
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:50,060
so think about that so if you're walking around out there listening to this show and you're

1321
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:55,380
controlling the playback from your Apple watch have no shame it got second place it got second

1322
01:13:55,380 --> 01:14:00,580
place out of a lot of nominations for the most life-changing hardware of 2020 all right

1323
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:09,840
then we are officially giving it to the Raspberry Pi 4 for 2020 as the most life-changing tech

1324
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:14,300
the best Linux game of the year this probably won't be surprised this won't be a surprise

1325
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:21,100
to anyone that has kids my age or has gotten sucked into the latest game with 99 submissions

1326
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:30,960
the audience has elected among us as the best Linux game of 2020 ironically not actually

1327
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:34,340
a Linux game so that's where this category gets interesting right I don't know that we

1328
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:39,880
gave clear instructions because yeah this is um you can only play among us via proton

1329
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:45,500
although it is number four on their ratings for ten most popular over at the proton DB

1330
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:49,540
so clearly there are a lot of Linux users who are playing among us and sounds like it

1331
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:56,300
works pretty decently yeah it is rated gold so as far as non Linux native games being

1332
01:14:56,300 --> 01:15:03,180
played on Linux it seems like it's pretty well supported at least yeah my son extensively

1333
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:08,860
tests it on Linux for me so that way I can be up to date on the latest among us developments

1334
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:15,940
and a little junior show researcher over there and yeah and I did say proton was fine it's

1335
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:20,020
really I think I want to celebrate the fact that we have more game options to us and I

1336
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:23,700
think the great thing about proton it's not just Windows compatibility but it's about

1337
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:30,240
preserving art as time goes on the platforms will move on but proton and the different

1338
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:36,140
releases of proton will be around and you'll be able to play games that you know are are

1339
01:15:36,140 --> 01:15:40,260
you able to preserve games and still actually play them you won't just have to look at them

1340
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:44,940
so I think among us deserves it you know it was it was an extremely popular game it's

1341
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:51,780
on it's on all of the platforms my kids played on mobile and on on their Linux boxes and

1342
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:56,980
as a parent I had that moment when they came to me and said dad can we play among us on

1343
01:15:56,980 --> 01:16:02,860
our computers and I always dread that conversation of hey I know all of your friends are talking

1344
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:06,460
about this at school it's like the biggest thing on YouTube right now for the YouTube

1345
01:16:06,460 --> 01:16:11,500
algorithm that you get subscribed to and by the way you can't play it on your Linux box

1346
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:15,060
because it Dylan already knows well there's Windows 10 and you could put that on the same

1347
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:20,980
hardware because this come up before and I was just dreading that moment and I went on

1348
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:25,380
Steam I saw it was available and I go on the proton DB and I look it up and I saw I had

1349
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:29,380
gold support I installed it I had to make like I don't know I think I had to change

1350
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:33,620
like one launch option or something it was it was documented and it fired right up and

1351
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:38,660
it has worked flawlessly since then and I felt I don't know man I just had like I don't

1352
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:42,980
know a sense of like I done right by him you know I got him a good computer it's running

1353
01:16:42,980 --> 01:16:47,220
Linux and he can play the latest games that his Windows and iOS using friends are playing

1354
01:16:47,220 --> 01:16:52,600
right now and I think it deserves recognition for that and same with same with cyberpunk

1355
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:59,140
you know we were able to get that running on Linux day one super hyped game and it came

1356
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:04,620
in at third place so Nautic which is an open source first person shooter came in at second

1357
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:08,740
place super tux cart came in at fourth place and then the list kind of goes off from there

1358
01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:13,560
to all the great games you've probably ever heard of even Skyrim is on there but I really

1359
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:16,820
think it's appropriate to give it to among us this year even though it's technically

1360
01:17:16,820 --> 01:17:21,080
a proton game I think the fact that we're getting these games on day one while the hype

1361
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:27,380
cycle is at peak that means a lot for gamers yeah we're all proton gamers now right yeah

1362
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:30,740
actually yeah I mean I have a little bit of both I definitely still prefer Linux native

1363
01:17:30,740 --> 01:17:34,980
it's a lot simpler ironically like the one of the few I've been playing a lot of proton

1364
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:40,540
games and I've been playing one Linux native game and that one is buggier than some of

1365
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:46,220
the proton ones it's funny how they can go both ways so the chat rooms making the argument

1366
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:49,100
and I'm gonna pitch this to Drew to see what you think Drew they're good they're making

1367
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:53,720
the argument that we should actually we should give this award to proton for best Linux game

1368
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:59,640
of the year even though it's not technically a game it has made it possible to play so

1369
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:04,740
many new games you know it's to get the core of this among us story it's at the core of

1370
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:09,780
cyberpunk of being available on day one it's not technically a game though that's a tough

1371
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:16,300
one I don't I don't know I mean I do think that we should definitely be giving proton

1372
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:21,580
a lot of credit here because it is doing a lot of heavy lifting for us but it's not a

1373
01:18:21,580 --> 01:18:28,260
game I don't know like I really want to show my appreciation for it but it just it's it's

1374
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:32,540
not a game yeah I mean it could have won the best new tech and it didn't right I guess

1375
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:36,420
because it wasn't new this year I guess if you look at 2020 it's been more of it being

1376
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:42,460
really awesome and it's great to see continued development but it's not like it's breakout

1377
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:50,140
year either mm-hmm all right so you think we should give it to among us I think so yeah

1378
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:58,620
I do all right the best new game for 2020 as awarded by our audience I'll have to figure

1379
01:18:58,620 --> 01:19:02,940
out who gets the tuxy for that one that's gonna be interesting so we have our best newcomer

1380
01:19:02,940 --> 01:19:10,180
open source project in 2020 and this one had a lot of possibilities there proton is on

1381
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:16,900
this list again so as Vulcans on this list oh my gosh this is there's a lot of submissions

1382
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:23,280
on this one the pine phone again showed up on this list things like rocky linux and then

1383
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:28,620
project linux are on here pipe wires on here I think rocky linux could still qualify in

1384
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:34,660
2021 to be honest with you but eight out of 154 different submissions five percent of

1385
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:41,000
the audience voted for wire guard wire guard and you know that's even up against things

1386
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:48,460
like proton OBS jellyfin bpy top it's a close one too because obviously we've been talking

1387
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:55,340
about wire guard for way too long but it was just this last January that it really made

1388
01:19:55,340 --> 01:20:00,320
it into the kernel so I think we have to count it right yeah I checked I sound like you did

1389
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:06,620
too it was indeed mainlined in 2020 it seems like it's because we followed it for so long

1390
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:15,480
it seems like it's been around forever and I use it still nearly on the daily it's fantastic

1391
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:22,220
I have no qualms about awarding this prize to wire guard and I think I even know how

1392
01:20:22,220 --> 01:20:26,420
to send them the tuxi what do you think drew should we give the best newcomer project any

1393
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:34,360
any objections no objections here I do think we should recognize that bpy top getting a

1394
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:40,300
close second place is impressive because we've only just discovered it ourselves true also

1395
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:46,400
nice to see pop shell getting some recognition in here system d home do you got four votes

1396
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:52,740
that's as many as rocky linux open zfs got a few pipe wire got a couple yeah there were

1397
01:20:52,740 --> 01:20:56,500
some good submissions in that category all right this is the one I was kind of getting

1398
01:20:56,500 --> 01:21:02,100
us to because this is the one I think we've all been waiting for let's see how this one

1399
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:10,740
goes this is as voted by the unplugged audience the nominations for the best desktop environment

1400
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:25,540
of 2020 with 218 submissions 34 percent of those went to gnome shell gnome shell wins

1401
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:30,460
with 34 percent of the vote from the jupiter broadcasting audience as debt as best desktop

1402
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:35,180
environment of 2020 you know you're supposed to hide some of your disappointment in your

1403
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:40,500
voice chris when you're reading it well i'm no i i'm waiting to be convinced actually

1404
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:45,020
um i i would have loved to have seen plasma as demonstrated earlier in the show i would

1405
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:50,380
have loved to have seen plasma win this category and they did come in at a solid number two

1406
01:21:50,380 --> 01:21:56,300
interesting to see sway come in at number three with 12 votes i3 after that then mate

1407
01:21:56,300 --> 01:22:02,540
cinnamon xfce then budgie pantheon an awesome window manager and then from there it goes

1408
01:22:02,540 --> 01:22:08,260
to lxde lx cute and uh well there's actually even an emax on there as you would expect

1409
01:22:08,260 --> 01:22:14,020
only one x nomad gnome shell had a good year they really did they really really did uh

1410
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:19,100
i i have ultimately ended back up on plasma but you know different strokes different folks

1411
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:26,260
and you have to acknowledge the extremely hard work that that project has received from

1412
01:22:26,260 --> 01:22:32,300
um multiple parties and it's shown the work is shown so i i could i could go with this

1413
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:36,100
i don't know wes or drew do you have a counter argument why we shouldn't give it to nomshell

1414
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:40,780
no i i i do think you're right they've had a big year the work continues and probably

1415
01:22:40,780 --> 01:22:46,020
next year is going to be even more exciting for the gnome shell show i'm excited for it

1416
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:53,180
and even if that's not what we are using day to day in the studio or on our personal machines

1417
01:22:53,180 --> 01:22:57,740
a lot of people are it's shipping in a ton of major desktops and it's a backbone of the

1418
01:22:57,740 --> 01:23:04,580
open source you know linux desktop community yep yeah i agree and hey look i live in georgia

1419
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:10,720
currently so i know a little bit something about uh nail biting elections but the difference

1420
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:18,420
between gnome shell and plasma here 74 to 68 that's not huge it absolutely is a nail

1421
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:28,820
biter but gnome shell definitely won all right then we give the 2020 best desktop environment

1422
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:33,880
tuxi to gnome shell congratulations everybody over there you've done you've done a really

1423
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:39,140
kick butt job and i this has been a lot of fun now the work begins on getting these issued

1424
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:43,220
thank you everybody who took the time to submit and go through this we'd love to get your

1425
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:47,620
ideas on how to refine the process for the future also if you'd like to support this

1426
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:53,200
show in future episodes please consider becoming a direct member a core contributor of this

1427
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:58,620
here humble podcast you just get that at unplugged core.com and it helps us stay independent keeps

1428
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:05,840
the ad load down and also means that you get access to two additional feeds a limited ad

1429
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:11,620
version of the show same full production just no ads or the full live stream it's even longer

1430
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:15,780
than this one with all of our screw-ups all the stuff that we talked about before we hit

1431
01:24:15,780 --> 01:24:19,980
record and everything we talk about after we hit record it's basically like a show that

1432
01:24:19,980 --> 01:24:24,820
never gets released and now it's available as a feed for our core contributors at unplugged

1433
01:24:24,820 --> 01:24:32,040
core.com but that does wrap up the tuxis for 2020 get ready and start watching projects

1434
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:36,960
over the year because we will be asking you again to submit your votes for the winners

1435
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:46,500
of 2021 at this time next year thank you very much and that's everything see you next Tuesday.
