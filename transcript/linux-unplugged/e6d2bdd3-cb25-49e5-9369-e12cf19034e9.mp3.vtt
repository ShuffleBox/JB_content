00:00.000 --> 00:03.120
Wes, have you seen this Airplane Mode box that you can put your phone in?

00:03.120 --> 00:07.760
I sure have. I don't know about you, Joe, but it's pretty difficult to stay away from my phone,

00:07.760 --> 00:12.400
even on the best of times. You're relaxing, you're at home, you're trying to have quality time with

00:12.400 --> 00:17.280
your friends or your family, and yet you're always drawn to the pocket. And that's where there's

00:17.280 --> 00:22.480
Airplane Mode, which, while it's a unique collaboration, so far it's just a prototype,

00:22.480 --> 00:28.400
but the designers really wanted to draw your attention to it. It's a concrete surface with

00:28.400 --> 00:32.720
some space inside for you to set your phone, and you really want to touch it. And as soon as you

00:32.720 --> 00:37.360
do, you quickly realize that opening the box requires both hands. It's a full sensorial

00:37.360 --> 00:42.480
experience. It's got a nice leather cradle. It's a special place for one of your mobile devices.

00:42.480 --> 00:47.200
You can put it inside, keep the vessel shut, and then now, next time you want it,

00:47.200 --> 00:50.320
it's an act of intention and not just being addicted.

00:50.320 --> 00:52.880
It does look like a giant bar of soap, though, doesn't it?

00:52.880 --> 00:57.280
Oh, you know, I hadn't even thought about that. Yes, it's either a really well-used pumice stone

00:57.280 --> 00:59.520
or a big dirty bar of soap.

00:59.520 --> 01:02.480
I don't know about you, but I've got the self-control to just not pick my phone up.

01:02.480 --> 01:06.080
I don't think I need to lock it in a big concrete container.

01:06.080 --> 01:11.680
Yeah, you know, I don't love the design. I am a little drawn to the intentionality and the idea

01:11.680 --> 01:17.520
that, well, maybe you have to choose to access your phone, but there is the lower tech solution,

01:17.520 --> 01:19.600
which is just turn your phone upside down.

01:19.600 --> 01:35.520
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 265, for September 4th, 2018.

01:37.680 --> 01:43.440
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's making a huge mess in the studio.

01:43.440 --> 01:46.000
While the boss is away, my name is Wes.

01:46.000 --> 01:46.880
My name is Joe.

01:46.880 --> 01:49.600
Thank you so much for joining me here today, Joe.

01:49.600 --> 01:53.760
Chris is away, but never fear. He can't stop Linux Unplugged.

01:53.760 --> 01:55.360
Yeah, we must stop meeting like this.

01:55.360 --> 02:00.720
We must. You know, someday I think we will, and it will be a happy celebratory occasion.

02:00.720 --> 02:04.800
And, you know, it almost is today because we've got a great show coming up.

02:04.800 --> 02:08.640
We've got tons of community news, both the highs and the lows,

02:08.640 --> 02:14.000
plus an update from the Wild West of mobile Linux operating systems.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.560
Some Google, Microsoft, all those big names, they filter in here, too.

02:18.560 --> 02:22.960
And of course, the latest drama from some of the muckety-mucks of the Linux kernel.

02:22.960 --> 02:24.640
Plus, some of our picks rounds it out.

02:25.440 --> 02:28.960
I'm pretty excited, but before we can get to any of that great stuff,

02:28.960 --> 02:30.240
well, we're going to need some help.

02:30.240 --> 02:32.800
And I think I know just the crew.

02:32.800 --> 02:34.480
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

02:34.480 --> 02:35.120
Hello.

02:35.120 --> 02:39.840
Oh, listen to that. It makes my heart sigh with happiness every darn time.

02:39.840 --> 02:40.960
How are you guys today?

02:40.960 --> 02:41.280
Awesome.

02:41.280 --> 02:41.760
Good.

02:41.760 --> 02:42.880
Eating a steak.

02:42.880 --> 02:44.160
Eating a steak.

02:44.160 --> 02:47.200
Now you're just not focused here on Linux Unplugged.

02:47.200 --> 02:47.440
All right.

02:47.440 --> 02:50.080
Well, let's focus on the release of Linux Mint Debian Edition.

02:50.080 --> 02:52.240
LMDE 3 has been released.

02:52.240 --> 02:55.280
Yes, it sure has, codenamed Cindy.

02:55.280 --> 02:58.160
Now, if you're not really familiar with Linux Mint Debian Edition,

02:58.160 --> 03:00.160
it's just like the regular Linux Mint,

03:00.160 --> 03:04.080
but instead of having all of its base packages supplied from the Ubuntu distribution,

03:04.080 --> 03:08.160
well, they go back one level further and pull them straight from Debian.

03:08.160 --> 03:13.360
It's kind of a tracking project to keep the developers' minds at ease knowing that,

03:13.360 --> 03:17.920
well, if Ubuntu suddenly disappeared, Linux Mint would still have something to stand on.

03:17.920 --> 03:21.200
I know it was one of the distributions I first started out with.

03:21.200 --> 03:25.920
You know, obviously Ubuntu was right there at the beginning of my practical Linux career,

03:25.920 --> 03:27.920
but quickly after I was like, oh, what's this?

03:27.920 --> 03:31.280
What's this distribution that has all the media codecs pre-installed?

03:31.280 --> 03:37.760
And, you know, I do think Linux Mint does a reasonable job of having that user base in mind.

03:37.760 --> 03:38.960
You can see in the release notes,

03:38.960 --> 03:42.240
they've got just a section of common troubleshooting tips right off the bat.

03:42.240 --> 03:44.640
So if you're like, oh, my, you know, my DVDs won't play in VLC.

03:44.640 --> 03:45.120
What do I do?

03:45.120 --> 03:48.080
Well, they haven't fixed that, but they've at least thought about it enough

03:48.080 --> 03:51.600
to have a handy guide right at the same place that you download your ISO.

03:52.240 --> 03:56.480
A thing to keep in mind here, though, is there are no point releases for the Debian Edition.

03:56.480 --> 04:00.400
So you just get a big new rebase on the next Debian base,

04:00.400 --> 04:02.560
and then you'll get all the latest Linux Mint changes.

04:02.560 --> 04:04.720
They'll just filter on down to your system.

04:04.720 --> 04:06.800
But this time there's no Mate version then.

04:06.800 --> 04:08.160
No, there's not, Joe.

04:08.160 --> 04:09.520
And I don't know about you.

04:09.520 --> 04:13.200
I do like Cinnamon, but Mate has always been such a reliable choice.

04:13.200 --> 04:15.360
I wonder what the motivation for leaving it out?

04:15.360 --> 04:17.280
Well, you've got Ubuntu Mate now, of course,

04:17.280 --> 04:22.480
which kind of renders the Mate version of standard Linux Mint a little bit irrelevant.

04:22.480 --> 04:25.440
So maybe it's kind of an acknowledgement of that.

04:25.440 --> 04:27.680
You know, I could see that Linux Mint does.

04:27.680 --> 04:30.880
Cinnamon and Linux Mint seemed like they have a definite kinship.

04:30.880 --> 04:32.800
They're, you know, developed in parallel.

04:33.440 --> 04:36.720
I'm not sure if I would go with the Debian Edition over the Ubuntu Edition,

04:36.720 --> 04:38.000
just at the moment.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.400
But if you're a Debian fan, maybe you don't like all the things

04:40.400 --> 04:44.960
that Ubuntu layers on top of Ubuntu's philosophy of putting together a distribution.

04:44.960 --> 04:47.680
Well, hey, you've got options, Linux Mint fans.

04:47.680 --> 04:50.080
Now, I know that you love GNOME.

04:50.080 --> 04:52.080
I'm not the hugest fan of it,

04:52.080 --> 04:55.360
but you must be pretty hyped for 3.30 that's coming soon.

04:55.360 --> 04:56.640
3.30, I know.

04:56.640 --> 05:00.240
I think we're expecting sometime this week for that to drop.

05:00.240 --> 05:01.440
It'll be dropping this weekend.

05:01.440 --> 05:02.240
Perfect. Okay.

05:02.240 --> 05:06.240
Hey, that's something great to look forward to as we begin everyone getting back to work.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.320
Now that it's almost fall.

05:08.320 --> 05:12.000
And well, if you're getting back to work, maybe you're refreshing some of your systems.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.560
I would be looking forward to GNOME 3.30.

05:15.360 --> 05:19.120
And you can get a little preview of that by checking out the latest changes coming to

05:19.120 --> 05:20.160
GNOME Tweaks.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.480
Now, if you don't use GNOME Tweaks,

05:22.480 --> 05:25.520
just hearken back to the days before GNOME Tweaks was as good as it was,

05:25.520 --> 05:27.440
or really even available.

05:27.440 --> 05:31.520
And you'll realize that you probably had to go dig way deep into some settings

05:31.520 --> 05:34.080
and config files to make all these handy changes.

05:34.080 --> 05:37.280
Some of the changes that we're seeing is, well,

05:37.280 --> 05:40.400
to start off, there's volume indicators in GNOME 3.30,

05:40.400 --> 05:44.000
and they can indicate when over amplification is in use.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.400
Now I use over amplification all the time when I'm doing my noise removal.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.240
I have to turn up the volume way loud.

05:50.240 --> 05:53.920
So that would be handy because sometimes I come back having turned it way up,

05:53.920 --> 05:55.600
and that just blows my ears off.

05:55.600 --> 05:58.960
So if I knew there was this nice red line showing me that,

05:58.960 --> 06:02.400
then yeah, hopefully they can add that to XFCE at some point.

06:02.400 --> 06:06.400
Right? You can get that stuff, you know, it's buried in the ulcer or pulse settings,

06:06.400 --> 06:09.280
but having it right on the desktop really does make a bit of a difference.

06:09.920 --> 06:14.400
Now, there's another new setting here, and that's the sound theme selector.

06:15.120 --> 06:16.800
Sound themes aren't very popular yet,

06:16.800 --> 06:20.560
but maybe this will help them become just a bit more noticeable.

06:20.560 --> 06:22.800
But you have got sound themes in Ubuntu, haven't you, Popeye?

06:24.160 --> 06:28.720
Maybe. We had someone in the community make a sound theme many, many years ago,

06:28.720 --> 06:33.840
and we removed it. I think they were slowly removed.

06:33.840 --> 06:39.360
Like the one that played a sound when you logged out was removed because it was too long,

06:39.360 --> 06:43.360
because it turned out we could shut the system down before the song finished playing.

06:43.360 --> 06:47.040
And so it was seen, that was a bit daft, leaving it in there.

06:47.040 --> 06:49.600
And then slowly loads of the others have been removed as well.

06:49.600 --> 06:53.440
So most of the sound themes, I think, are removed.

06:53.440 --> 06:57.120
And the only thing you get is like a donk noise when you, you know,

06:57.120 --> 07:01.440
as the terminal bell, and there's not a lot of other noises in there.

07:01.440 --> 07:04.640
That's something, you know, I hadn't, I wasn't too familiar with sound themes

07:04.640 --> 07:06.400
even before researching for this show.

07:06.400 --> 07:09.040
So I'll be, I'll be playing with that in the future.

07:09.600 --> 07:12.720
One more thing I wanted to highlight was that coming up,

07:12.720 --> 07:17.440
we will see possibly center new windows, that option being enabled by default.

07:17.440 --> 07:21.520
And it doesn't sound like much, but actually, I think it's kind of a nice touch.

07:21.520 --> 07:24.160
Seems like it might be going into Ubuntu 18.10.

07:24.160 --> 07:26.720
Or it has been enabled in Ubuntu 18.10, rather.

07:27.280 --> 07:31.120
And that might be a setting I'm gonna have to copy on my custom assembled Gnome desktop.

07:31.760 --> 07:34.640
So it's not all good news this week, unfortunately, is it?

07:35.200 --> 07:38.880
Purism has pushed back the release date of the Librem 5

07:38.880 --> 07:42.560
in a shocking announcement that none of us saw coming.

07:42.560 --> 07:44.560
No, not ever.

07:45.440 --> 07:48.480
I am still, you know, just a little bit disappointed.

07:48.480 --> 07:51.360
It seems like you've been following this with some interest over there, Joe.

07:51.360 --> 07:52.880
Yeah, I've been following this from the start

07:52.880 --> 07:56.800
because I have wanted a totally free phone to be available,

07:56.800 --> 07:58.320
but I've also wanted it to be good.

07:58.880 --> 08:00.400
And that's kind of the problem.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.960
You know, when you're starting these things off from scratch,

08:02.960 --> 08:06.960
it's very difficult to make something that's going to even

08:07.920 --> 08:10.560
compete with iOS and Android in any way at all.

08:11.600 --> 08:14.000
It's interesting the spin that they put on this, though.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.960
The kind of official press release announcing this delay until April 2019

08:18.960 --> 08:24.560
is very much kind of laying on how great the idea is

08:24.560 --> 08:27.920
and, you know, how terrible the other alternatives are.

08:27.920 --> 08:29.360
And then it's kind of right at the bottom.

08:29.360 --> 08:30.960
Oh, yeah, and we've slipped a little bit.

08:31.520 --> 08:34.240
And here's a technical blog post for more details.

08:34.240 --> 08:37.360
And it's really that technical blog post that's more interesting

08:37.360 --> 08:40.240
talking about exactly why this delay has happened

08:40.240 --> 08:46.240
because they got this IMX 8 board later than they had planned, basically.

08:46.240 --> 08:47.600
And when they did their testing on it,

08:47.600 --> 08:50.960
it turns out that it wasn't quite up to scratch.

08:50.960 --> 08:52.400
Yeah, and, you know, there really just are.

08:52.400 --> 08:54.320
I think we've seen this from some of the other vendors

08:54.320 --> 08:55.760
who have attempted to play in this space.

08:55.760 --> 09:00.960
There's just a lot of challenges of making a non-Android-based mobile phone.

09:02.160 --> 09:04.160
Android has such a long and convoluted history,

09:04.160 --> 09:08.000
especially with all the intricacies you see on different systems on a chip

09:08.000 --> 09:11.280
and all the various blobs and other hardware components

09:11.280 --> 09:14.480
you need to assemble to make sure that it all boots up, can actually run.

09:14.480 --> 09:16.720
And then, as you so wisely put, Joe,

09:16.720 --> 09:20.240
you know, is actually usable at the end of the day.

09:20.240 --> 09:22.880
Yeah, unfortunately, the bugs in this case

09:23.440 --> 09:26.480
meant that it was just going to have terrible battery life

09:26.480 --> 09:28.320
and just it wouldn't go to sleep properly

09:28.320 --> 09:29.760
and use a single core, that sort of thing.

09:30.480 --> 09:32.640
So that's pretty critical.

09:32.640 --> 09:35.040
And at least they are acknowledging that and saying,

09:35.040 --> 09:36.560
look, we're going to have to delay it

09:36.560 --> 09:38.640
rather than just forging ahead and making it terrible.

09:39.440 --> 09:42.160
It kind of makes me think that once we finally do get this,

09:42.960 --> 09:44.240
it isn't going to be terrible.

09:44.240 --> 09:46.400
You know, they're putting some thought into this here.

09:46.400 --> 09:51.040
They're making sure that they don't just ship it as soon as they possibly can.

09:51.040 --> 09:52.160
They want it to be good.

09:53.200 --> 09:55.200
I mean, it's not going to compete with Android and iOS.

09:55.200 --> 09:57.920
There's just no doubt about that, not to start with.

09:57.920 --> 09:59.920
But it is going to be fully free.

09:59.920 --> 10:03.120
We have to hope that there is that sweet spot of usable enough

10:03.120 --> 10:06.400
and still respecting a lot of the principles and philosophical positions

10:06.400 --> 10:09.280
that I think a lot of the audience here is interested in

10:09.280 --> 10:12.800
and has just not been something that we've really been capable of

10:12.800 --> 10:15.120
barring maybe a few exceptions in the mobile space.

10:15.120 --> 10:17.520
Now, buried in those technical arguments, Joe,

10:17.520 --> 10:21.280
is there any mention of just how long it slipped?

10:21.280 --> 10:22.640
Well, yeah, they say April now.

10:22.640 --> 10:25.360
It was originally going to be January 2019.

10:25.360 --> 10:28.800
Now they're saying April, so pretty much a quarter,

10:28.800 --> 10:31.600
which sounds a bit arbitrary to me.

10:32.320 --> 10:35.760
I think that we'll be lucky to see it by the middle of next year, really,

10:35.760 --> 10:40.720
because, you know, they kind of had this plan to put it out in January,

10:40.720 --> 10:43.600
and it was all based on a certain number of things happening in a certain order,

10:43.600 --> 10:45.840
getting the development kits and all the rest of it.

10:45.840 --> 10:48.800
And each thing seems to be slipping just that little bit.

10:49.360 --> 10:54.240
So I think, yeah, we'll be lucky if it's before, I don't know, June or July.

10:54.240 --> 10:57.440
I'm not undecided on if I'm going to double down and keep playing on the Android world.

10:57.440 --> 11:02.000
I see those ever so smug and satisfied iPhone users and wonder,

11:02.000 --> 11:05.840
maybe in a world where I didn't use my phone for anything but simple phone things,

11:05.840 --> 11:07.040
that could work for me.

11:07.840 --> 11:11.280
There is, though, another option, and that's the Xero phone,

11:11.280 --> 11:16.080
which is a $50 open source smartphone based on the Raspberry Pi Zero.

11:16.080 --> 11:18.400
Yeah, this is a little bit speculative at the moment.

11:18.400 --> 11:19.760
It's not actually available.

11:19.760 --> 11:21.680
It's been announced on CrowdSupply,

11:21.680 --> 11:25.600
and you can kind of put your email address to register your interest.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.760
So who knows when it's actually going to come about?

11:27.760 --> 11:31.040
But it does look pretty cool that it's a very basic phone.

11:31.040 --> 11:34.560
What do you expect for $50 based on the Raspberry Pi Zero?

11:34.560 --> 11:37.680
But at least it is something a little bit different,

11:37.680 --> 11:41.360
and potentially that kind of second phone that you just take out

11:41.360 --> 11:43.600
when you don't really want to take your main phone out.

11:43.600 --> 11:45.600
Yeah, well, there's all kinds of use cases for that,

11:45.600 --> 11:49.600
even if it's just a backup phone because you smashed yours on a rock.

11:49.600 --> 11:52.400
It's kind of set apart by the things it doesn't have.

11:52.400 --> 11:55.120
No carrier locks, bloated apps, or data mining,

11:55.120 --> 11:57.680
and it doesn't depend on big companies.

11:58.240 --> 12:01.280
Of course, that means you lose out on plenty of other options,

12:01.280 --> 12:04.640
but I know I feel a little insecure when I just have the one phone,

12:04.640 --> 12:07.440
especially given how much you actually need to have.

12:07.440 --> 12:09.600
You need a phone to just communicate these days.

12:09.600 --> 12:13.280
So, hey, I have a Raspberry Pi Zero hanging around.

12:14.080 --> 12:16.240
Now it looks like I just need a few more supplies.

12:16.240 --> 12:18.320
Well, you definitely don't want to be using Android

12:18.320 --> 12:21.600
because Google will not patch a flaw

12:21.600 --> 12:25.600
in any of the other older versions of Android than the current one,

12:26.160 --> 12:27.920
which is pretty serious.

12:28.480 --> 12:29.360
Oh, Google.

12:31.040 --> 12:35.520
This is really exactly the sort of thing that makes people upset

12:35.520 --> 12:38.080
with modern phone and phone operating systems.

12:38.080 --> 12:39.840
Somewhere between all the different systems on a chip,

12:39.840 --> 12:43.280
somewhere between the rapid state of industry change,

12:43.280 --> 12:45.840
and then you have software practices.

12:45.840 --> 12:48.480
And that might be where it gets sometimes the most frustrating,

12:48.480 --> 12:52.000
at least for me, because you've got to imagine that this is possible,

12:52.000 --> 12:52.640
at least in theory.

12:52.640 --> 12:54.080
It may be that it's not profitable.

12:54.080 --> 12:57.360
It may be that it just is a lot of work to backport these patches.

12:58.400 --> 13:01.280
But come on, we know Google has the resources.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.160
Yeah, it's one thing for the vendors and the OEMs

13:04.160 --> 13:06.000
to not actually implement the patches,

13:06.000 --> 13:08.320
but for Google to just not put them out there in the first place,

13:08.320 --> 13:10.480
that's not very good, is it, at all, really?

13:10.480 --> 13:11.840
And to say to people,

13:12.400 --> 13:15.920
hey, here's your solution, upgrade to Android 9 Pie.

13:16.800 --> 13:17.840
What kind of solution is that

13:17.840 --> 13:20.720
when there's billions of people out there using the old versions?

13:20.720 --> 13:23.360
Yeah, I mean, it's not even really possible for anyone

13:23.360 --> 13:25.920
apart from those who use the Pixel devices,

13:25.920 --> 13:28.560
or if you're lucky enough that your manufacturer actually goes

13:28.560 --> 13:31.520
and updates whatever modified version they've based it on.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.440
Maybe you go install your own operating system,

13:33.440 --> 13:35.760
but you're pretty much a special case there.

13:35.760 --> 13:37.840
And what worries me is that there's going to be,

13:37.840 --> 13:38.960
you know, there's a lot of consumers

13:38.960 --> 13:40.640
who don't need the newest and greatest,

13:40.640 --> 13:42.800
and they have, some of my family members,

13:42.800 --> 13:44.960
they have the original Nexus 5.

13:44.960 --> 13:47.360
And while it's not fast and it doesn't have a lot of storage

13:47.360 --> 13:48.800
and the camera's not so great,

13:48.800 --> 13:50.960
it really does just work for them.

13:50.960 --> 13:53.760
But I worry knowing that they're on an unsupported platform

13:53.760 --> 13:55.680
that won't get security updates.

13:55.680 --> 14:00.080
And it's shocking that, you know, Android 9 just came out

14:00.080 --> 14:01.360
and that we're already in a world

14:01.360 --> 14:03.920
where anything else isn't secure.

14:03.920 --> 14:04.960
I don't like it.

14:04.960 --> 14:05.760
Yeah, I don't like it.

14:05.760 --> 14:07.600
But I like that you called me a special case, Wes,

14:07.600 --> 14:09.920
because, you know, I run Lineage on my phone,

14:09.920 --> 14:13.440
and my wife runs Lineage on her Nexus 5.

14:13.440 --> 14:15.120
So yeah, we're both special cases.

14:15.120 --> 14:16.080
I'm going to tell her that.

14:16.080 --> 14:19.600
Oh, how does the Lineage run on the Nexus 5?

14:19.600 --> 14:20.800
Has she been happy with that?

14:20.800 --> 14:23.040
Yeah, she's been very happy with it.

14:23.040 --> 14:24.960
The camera on that phone isn't great,

14:24.960 --> 14:26.320
and that's the only thing she doesn't like.

14:26.320 --> 14:29.600
But yeah, I keep trying to tell her to get,

14:29.600 --> 14:31.440
you know, trying to convince her to get a better phone

14:31.440 --> 14:32.560
just so I've got something to play with.

14:32.560 --> 14:34.400
But she says, no, I don't need to.

14:34.400 --> 14:34.800
It's fine.

14:34.800 --> 14:36.400
I've got security updates.

14:36.400 --> 14:38.240
It's working fine for what I need it for.

14:38.240 --> 14:38.800
It's small.

14:38.800 --> 14:40.640
The only phones you can get now are giant.

14:41.200 --> 14:42.720
So yeah, she's perfectly happy with it.

14:42.720 --> 14:44.960
I mean, it's not the quickest phone in the world.

14:44.960 --> 14:46.560
It's, you know, how many years old is that now?

14:46.560 --> 14:48.080
It must be five years old or something.

14:48.080 --> 14:48.480
Yeah.

14:48.480 --> 14:51.280
But yeah, with Lineage, she's got the very latest updates.

14:52.160 --> 14:53.280
So yeah, she's happy.

14:53.280 --> 14:54.960
I am glad to hear it.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.800
Is there anyone in the mumble room

14:56.800 --> 14:58.880
who's really an avid Android user?

14:58.880 --> 15:01.760
Are we all just sort of accepting what we get

15:01.760 --> 15:02.880
from the big upstreams?

15:02.880 --> 15:05.200
How many people are, you know, rooting their phones,

15:05.200 --> 15:07.680
actually installing different operating systems?

15:07.680 --> 15:08.160
I did.

15:09.920 --> 15:12.080
I've got a few Android phones near me.

15:12.080 --> 15:16.080
And obviously, I used to run Ubuntu Touch on some.

15:16.080 --> 15:17.120
Right, yeah.

15:17.120 --> 15:20.480
But my main phone is OnePlus 3T.

15:20.480 --> 15:24.240
And I did try Lineage on it,

15:24.240 --> 15:26.720
but I found it a lot slower than the stock ROM

15:26.720 --> 15:27.600
I got from OnePlus.

15:27.600 --> 15:30.640
So I wiped it and reverted back to Oxygen,

15:31.440 --> 15:33.840
which means I don't get the firehose of updates

15:33.840 --> 15:35.680
that Joe gets on his.

15:35.680 --> 15:40.480
But I get security updates at some point, sometimes.

15:40.480 --> 15:42.400
So I'm happy enough with that.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.360
Yeah, occasionally.

15:43.360 --> 15:44.960
Yeah, now and then I get an update

15:44.960 --> 15:46.080
and that's good enough for me.

15:46.080 --> 15:48.160
Which aspects were slow then, particularly?

15:48.160 --> 15:48.960
Whole thing.

15:48.960 --> 15:50.480
The UI was laggy.

15:51.040 --> 15:51.920
It was really slow.

15:52.800 --> 15:54.240
You know that thing you do

15:54.240 --> 15:55.760
whenever someone hands you their phone

15:55.760 --> 15:57.040
or you grab somebody else's phone,

15:57.040 --> 15:58.560
the first thing you do is swipe left and right,

15:58.560 --> 15:59.920
swipe up and down on the app screen

15:59.920 --> 16:01.200
to see how it feels, right?

16:01.200 --> 16:03.360
Because you don't want to dive into their applications

16:03.360 --> 16:05.840
and start using stuff and seeing their data

16:05.840 --> 16:06.800
if you're the kind of person

16:06.800 --> 16:08.400
who lets someone else use your phone.

16:08.400 --> 16:12.160
But that's all you need to do with Lineage on the OnePlus 3T.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.480
If you compare it side by side with Oxygen,

16:15.360 --> 16:17.040
I found it really laggy and slow.

16:17.040 --> 16:19.680
That's interesting because I've never had the stock ROM on mine.

16:19.680 --> 16:23.280
It's always been just Lineage from day one.

16:23.280 --> 16:25.200
So I've never experienced it.

16:25.200 --> 16:26.560
You poor, poor child.

16:26.560 --> 16:27.360
You poor thing.

16:27.360 --> 16:29.840
I know, but for me it's perfectly fast

16:29.840 --> 16:33.920
with an AWD or ADW launcher on it

16:33.920 --> 16:35.280
and I turn off the animations.

16:35.280 --> 16:36.960
I've never noticed it slow down really.

16:36.960 --> 16:38.880
Next time we're in the same physical location,

16:38.880 --> 16:40.160
we'll put our phones side by side

16:40.160 --> 16:43.200
and try them out with some benchmarky type stuff

16:43.200 --> 16:46.160
like human perception and we'll see.

16:46.160 --> 16:48.720
Maybe it's just my perception and I'm biased,

16:48.720 --> 16:50.480
but yeah, it felt like it.

16:50.480 --> 16:53.200
But I do use Lineage on the OnePlus X.

16:53.200 --> 16:55.360
The tablet thing, what's it called?

16:55.360 --> 16:59.600
Nexus 7 2013 and a couple other devices.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.680
Don't be going, oh Wes, I've got one of those as well.

17:01.680 --> 17:02.720
I use that regularly.

17:02.720 --> 17:05.280
No, it was an ooh of impressed.

17:05.280 --> 17:07.120
You've been 2013 is right in the name

17:07.120 --> 17:10.000
and five years, that's some support.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.400
That's my zombie apocalypse tablet.

17:12.400 --> 17:16.960
It's got a lot of eBooks and how to start fires,

17:16.960 --> 17:20.480
how to generate electricity and all that kind of stuff.

17:20.480 --> 17:21.440
Survival books on it.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.280
Do you have extra shotgun shells just sort of

17:23.280 --> 17:25.760
in the case there for that situation?

17:25.760 --> 17:27.680
On advice of my legal team,

17:27.680 --> 17:29.360
I am not going to respond to that.

17:31.680 --> 17:35.040
Well, one thing that I do is flash Google Apps on it,

17:35.040 --> 17:37.360
Open G Apps Pico, which gives me just enough

17:37.360 --> 17:38.400
to get the Play Store running.

17:38.400 --> 17:41.680
But now I'm kind of regretting that given that

17:41.680 --> 17:44.560
Android collects 10 times more data than iOS,

17:44.560 --> 17:46.240
at least according to a recent study.

17:46.240 --> 17:49.040
Yeah, the paper titled Google Data Collection

17:49.040 --> 17:52.480
from Douglas C. Schmidt, a computer science professor

17:52.480 --> 17:54.320
at Vanderbilt University.

17:54.320 --> 17:56.720
Well, it arrives at some stark conclusions regarding

17:56.720 --> 17:59.440
just how much data Google is sucking up

17:59.440 --> 18:02.160
from all of those handsets out there.

18:02.160 --> 18:04.080
Among several findings, the experiments found

18:04.080 --> 18:06.640
an idle Android phone with the Chrome web browser

18:06.640 --> 18:09.440
active in the background, communicated location information

18:09.440 --> 18:14.320
to Google 340 times during a 24 hour period.

18:14.320 --> 18:16.240
Now, of course, they ran the same experiment

18:16.240 --> 18:19.120
on iOS with Safari.

18:19.120 --> 18:21.120
Google could not collect any appreciable data

18:21.120 --> 18:24.720
unless the user was actually interacting with the device.

18:24.720 --> 18:27.040
That's kind of a contrast right there.

18:27.040 --> 18:28.880
Well, it's not hugely surprising that Google

18:28.880 --> 18:32.160
couldn't collect the data, but even just the sheer number

18:32.160 --> 18:35.760
of pings back home were lower on iOS as well,

18:35.760 --> 18:37.760
which is not altogether surprising, is it?

18:37.760 --> 18:39.920
Given that you've got two completely different

18:39.920 --> 18:41.680
business models, you've got Google's business model,

18:41.680 --> 18:44.960
which is collect all the data, sell all the adverts.

18:44.960 --> 18:49.920
Whereas Apple is just sell the product for five times

18:49.920 --> 18:52.800
what we build it for, probably 10 times.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.720
You know, they just sell expensive stuff.

18:54.720 --> 18:55.600
That's their business model.

18:55.600 --> 18:59.200
And then they sell you content to watch on it.

18:59.200 --> 19:02.400
So it's not a surprise at all.

19:02.400 --> 19:05.280
I don't think anyone was surprised reading this story.

19:05.280 --> 19:06.560
No, I don't think so.

19:06.560 --> 19:09.280
It was interesting, some of the deeper findings they had.

19:09.280 --> 19:11.440
Of course, there's just the actual frequency

19:11.440 --> 19:12.400
of data transmission.

19:12.400 --> 19:15.040
But the research also turned up some of the ways

19:15.040 --> 19:17.200
that Google could potentially tie together

19:17.200 --> 19:19.440
anonymous data collected through passive means

19:19.440 --> 19:22.400
and correlate that with personal information.

19:22.400 --> 19:25.040
And of course, that's what advertisers want, right?

19:25.040 --> 19:27.600
They want, you have all of these sort of statistics

19:27.600 --> 19:29.440
and numbers that flow through from user actions

19:29.440 --> 19:30.720
and you want to piece those together

19:30.720 --> 19:32.800
so that you can actually sell that information

19:32.800 --> 19:34.400
as something useful.

19:34.400 --> 19:36.720
As an example, on an Android device,

19:36.720 --> 19:39.200
so-called anonymous advertising identifiers

19:39.200 --> 19:41.120
that collect activity data on apps

19:41.120 --> 19:42.880
and third-party web page visits,

19:42.880 --> 19:44.000
well, that can get associated

19:44.000 --> 19:46.240
with the user's real Google identity

19:46.240 --> 19:49.200
by the passing of device-level identification information

19:49.200 --> 19:51.760
right back to Google services.

19:51.760 --> 19:53.520
And well, that same thing goes

19:53.520 --> 19:57.520
for the supposedly user-anonymous DoubleClick Cookie ID.

19:57.520 --> 20:00.160
It is kind of upsetting that just by default

20:00.160 --> 20:01.680
when you choose this platform,

20:01.680 --> 20:03.520
especially the platform that's based on the technology

20:03.520 --> 20:06.240
that, well, we're all here to talk about today,

20:06.240 --> 20:09.520
you end up with all of these other implications

20:09.520 --> 20:12.240
and you kind of end up at a crossroads

20:12.240 --> 20:13.120
where you have to choose between,

20:13.120 --> 20:15.760
well, do I care about nominal open-sourceness,

20:15.760 --> 20:18.080
that sort of those arguments that I want a phone

20:18.080 --> 20:19.360
that at least is somewhat open-source

20:19.360 --> 20:20.640
that runs on technologies,

20:20.640 --> 20:23.120
someone can audit that I can understand,

20:23.120 --> 20:25.520
or do I care more about my internet privacy,

20:25.520 --> 20:26.400
about my interactions

20:26.400 --> 20:28.720
and about all of my personal information?

20:28.720 --> 20:31.360
You would hope, and oftentimes those align,

20:31.360 --> 20:33.360
not in today's mobile phone market.

20:33.360 --> 20:35.440
No, I'm just going to get one of those airplane mode boxes,

20:35.440 --> 20:37.280
stick my phone in it and move into the woods, Wes.

20:37.280 --> 20:38.160
It's the only answer.

20:38.160 --> 20:40.560
Yeah, you know, I mean, maybe you can do this RMS style

20:40.560 --> 20:42.320
and sort of just collect all your stuff,

20:42.320 --> 20:45.280
do it offline and then send it up occasionally

20:45.280 --> 20:46.720
or get some sort of personal assistant

20:46.720 --> 20:48.320
who can do all of your tweeting for you.

20:48.320 --> 20:49.920
They'll scrape the Linux news

20:49.920 --> 20:52.160
and tell you what to say for your shows.

20:52.160 --> 20:53.440
That sounds a lot easier.

20:53.440 --> 20:54.960
That does sound a lot easier, yeah.

20:54.960 --> 20:55.920
Let's get on that.

20:55.920 --> 20:59.040
Well, okay, if you're going to get a personal assistant, Joe,

20:59.040 --> 21:00.800
I think you'll probably need to set them up

21:00.800 --> 21:01.680
with some equipment

21:01.680 --> 21:04.240
and you're probably not going to give up your machines

21:04.240 --> 21:06.320
even if you're not using them anymore.

21:06.320 --> 21:09.840
Have you considered a potential Chromebook?

21:09.840 --> 21:11.120
I don't know, Wes, I don't know.

21:11.120 --> 21:13.200
I don't like any more Google in my life,

21:13.200 --> 21:15.600
but this Ars Technica article that you found

21:15.600 --> 21:19.120
about $600 Chromebooks being dangerous to Microsoft,

21:19.120 --> 21:20.240
that sounds good to me.

21:20.240 --> 21:23.360
Oh, not a Microsoft fan, are we, Joe?

21:23.360 --> 21:25.680
Come on, who here likes Microsoft?

21:25.680 --> 21:26.640
Okay, yeah, that's fair.

21:26.640 --> 21:28.640
You know, I think here at Linux Unplugged

21:28.640 --> 21:31.600
we have been trying to say it is a new Microsoft.

21:31.600 --> 21:35.040
Now what that means, that's up to the audience to decide.

21:35.040 --> 21:37.760
But there is this added complication.

21:37.760 --> 21:39.280
This article in particular is highlighting

21:39.280 --> 21:42.000
Lenovo's new $600 Yoga Chromebook,

21:42.000 --> 21:43.360
which, well, as they say,

21:43.360 --> 21:45.280
brings high-end styling and materials

21:45.280 --> 21:46.640
to the Chromebook space,

21:46.640 --> 21:48.560
along with, you know, well-specced internals

21:48.560 --> 21:51.680
and a high-quality screen.

21:51.680 --> 21:55.120
Also, there's Dell's $600 Inspiron Chromebook 14,

21:55.120 --> 21:57.280
slightly lower specs, but it's a similar offering

21:57.280 --> 21:59.600
with better styling, bigger, better quality screens,

21:59.600 --> 22:01.280
and, well, superior specs

22:01.280 --> 22:03.440
to a lot of the other Chromebooks out there.

22:03.440 --> 22:05.360
Yeah, we're talking mid-range here, aren't we?

22:05.360 --> 22:08.320
We're not talking XPS quality and price,

22:08.320 --> 22:11.840
and we're not talking about terrible, cheap Chromebook.

22:11.840 --> 22:13.440
We're talking about that middle range

22:13.440 --> 22:16.960
that appeals to not kids, but kind of college students

22:16.960 --> 22:19.760
and people kind of just out of college or whatever.

22:19.760 --> 22:23.600
And it is Google's play against Microsoft,

22:24.400 --> 22:28.320
potentially, to try and get people

22:28.320 --> 22:29.760
onto the Chrome OS platform

22:29.760 --> 22:31.120
using all the Google services,

22:31.120 --> 22:34.400
get tied into things like Drive and Docs and everything,

22:35.120 --> 22:39.680
and then hopefully push Microsoft off their perch

22:39.680 --> 22:41.840
at the top of that market.

22:41.840 --> 22:43.040
Microsoft has obviously been

22:43.040 --> 22:45.120
sort of the assumed solution for this,

22:45.120 --> 22:46.160
and in some ways it feels like

22:46.160 --> 22:48.160
we're watching the Chromebook world grow up.

22:48.160 --> 22:50.240
You know, it started off with these really cheap machines

22:50.240 --> 22:52.000
for schools and for educational use

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
and young kids using them,

22:54.000 --> 22:55.280
and now that some of those people

22:55.280 --> 22:57.600
that have been using them, they get older,

22:57.600 --> 23:00.240
they're familiar with the Chrome OS interface already,

23:00.240 --> 23:02.640
and at the same time, Chrome OS is just becoming

23:02.640 --> 23:05.360
more and more capable of real workloads.

23:05.360 --> 23:08.160
So the Lenovo people, they're excited about this.

23:08.160 --> 23:10.560
They say that this new Chromebook was developed

23:10.560 --> 23:12.400
because the company was seeing demand for Chromebooks

23:12.400 --> 23:15.520
from users with a bit more disposable income,

23:15.520 --> 23:18.400
college graduates, people from upper-class families

23:18.400 --> 23:20.080
that could afford a nicer machine.

23:21.040 --> 23:22.880
That's a lot of the space where you kind of see,

23:22.880 --> 23:25.360
especially for people that aren't computer enthusiasts,

23:25.360 --> 23:29.520
just, you know, an average midline Dell HP laptop

23:29.520 --> 23:31.680
that, of course, they've got that Microsoft Windows deal.

23:31.680 --> 23:32.800
That's going to come preinstalled.

23:32.800 --> 23:34.560
You've got the latest and greatest Microsoft products.

23:34.560 --> 23:37.040
You'll probably get some sort of preinstalled office suite

23:37.040 --> 23:38.080
that you'll start using.

23:38.640 --> 23:41.200
With the Chromebook's advantage of already being in schools

23:41.200 --> 23:44.320
and having all the sorts of user management

23:44.320 --> 23:45.600
and child permission controls

23:45.600 --> 23:47.360
that maybe you have to know what you're doing

23:47.360 --> 23:49.360
on maybe an open-source solution,

23:49.920 --> 23:51.280
seems pretty competitive.

23:51.280 --> 23:53.440
This seems to be mostly in America, though, doesn't it?

23:53.440 --> 23:54.720
This push into education.

23:54.720 --> 23:55.840
Poppy, you've got kids.

23:55.840 --> 23:58.640
Do they ever use Chromebooks at school,

23:58.640 --> 24:00.000
or is it all just Windows?

24:01.360 --> 24:03.840
Never seen a Chromebook in the kids' school,

24:04.640 --> 24:07.760
but I do know the school that one of them

24:07.760 --> 24:09.680
is going to starting tomorrow.

24:10.880 --> 24:12.160
They get given iPads,

24:12.880 --> 24:14.960
so that's a different thing altogether,

24:15.680 --> 24:16.800
which should be interesting.

24:16.800 --> 24:19.680
Well, that's really where the competition is these days,

24:19.680 --> 24:20.720
isn't it, in education?

24:21.760 --> 24:24.000
Windows and, you know, Microsoft,

24:24.640 --> 24:27.440
I get the feeling are kind of slipping a little bit,

24:27.440 --> 24:30.560
and it's really between Chromebooks and iPads, isn't it?

24:31.200 --> 24:32.080
Possibly.

24:32.080 --> 24:34.400
Ask me again in a month or two when I've seen what they get.

24:35.360 --> 24:35.920
Yeah.

24:35.920 --> 24:39.920
Oh, yeah, it is just that back-to-school season.

24:39.920 --> 24:41.120
That's a funny angle.

24:41.120 --> 24:42.560
You know, I always think about what I'm going to get

24:42.560 --> 24:43.600
for the latest things,

24:43.600 --> 24:46.400
but, of course, kids need supplies too.

24:46.400 --> 24:48.960
Yeah, and Google is really trying to hook them

24:48.960 --> 24:49.680
while they're young.

24:49.680 --> 24:52.240
That's why they got into the whole education market.

24:52.240 --> 24:54.640
I mean, Microsoft did it 20 years earlier, didn't they?

24:54.640 --> 24:55.760
Yes, absolutely.

24:55.760 --> 24:58.800
I wonder where this leaves some of the, you know,

24:58.800 --> 25:02.640
if you've got iPads, but where do you go?

25:02.640 --> 25:05.520
I guess you can go to the desktop Mac OS experience,

25:05.520 --> 25:09.680
but between some of the newer lower-end Windows devices

25:09.680 --> 25:11.600
and then more functional Chromebooks,

25:11.600 --> 25:13.760
it's just a lot easier to get started with.

25:13.760 --> 25:15.760
And then if you can, you know, maybe you go up,

25:15.760 --> 25:17.360
you start, you learn about Linux.

25:18.320 --> 25:21.680
One of these kids could be just using the Windows subsystem,

25:21.680 --> 25:24.080
or they could be running their Linux app on Chrome OS.

25:24.080 --> 25:27.440
And does that mean, do they ever make it off those platforms?

25:27.440 --> 25:28.960
Or is it just too easy these days?

25:28.960 --> 25:30.880
You use a combination of web apps,

25:30.880 --> 25:32.800
you've got Linux there if you need it,

25:32.800 --> 25:34.400
you've got some native apps maybe.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.760
Are you ever going to need to install Ubuntu for real?

25:37.760 --> 25:38.800
Well, that's a good question.

25:39.280 --> 25:42.160
Probably hoping that people will keep installing that.

25:42.160 --> 25:44.320
And I think that they will.

25:44.320 --> 25:46.000
It's going nowhere on the server, is it?

25:46.000 --> 25:47.200
And that's the thing that people,

25:48.000 --> 25:51.280
as they get more into technology and realize that

25:51.280 --> 25:53.360
everything in the world runs on Linux,

25:53.360 --> 25:55.840
runs on Linux pretty much server-wise,

25:56.480 --> 25:57.600
they then realize, well, hang on,

25:57.600 --> 25:59.600
it's so robust and solid on the server,

25:59.600 --> 26:02.000
maybe it's worth a try on the desktop.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.520
And I don't know if these, you know,

26:05.520 --> 26:08.960
the subsystem and the Linux apps on Chrome OS

26:09.840 --> 26:11.120
are really going to do it justice.

26:11.120 --> 26:14.560
And hopefully, I think it's only going to be a percent,

26:14.560 --> 26:15.680
put it this way, you know,

26:15.680 --> 26:19.360
it's not going to be everyone who gets into development.

26:20.080 --> 26:21.920
I'm sure that some of them will be absolutely fine

26:21.920 --> 26:23.600
with the subsystem.

26:24.400 --> 26:27.520
But it only takes a small percent to make a big difference.

26:28.080 --> 26:29.600
And so that's my hope.

26:29.600 --> 26:31.680
I don't know, that's my positive spin on it.

26:31.680 --> 26:31.920
Right.

26:31.920 --> 26:34.640
And maybe one way to look at it too is that

26:34.640 --> 26:37.200
if it's easier to become familiar with those technologies,

26:37.200 --> 26:39.120
then the draw will be immediate, right?

26:39.120 --> 26:41.120
You can start playing around in a terminal,

26:41.120 --> 26:43.760
getting a feeling for the real Linux environment.

26:43.760 --> 26:46.160
And then when you're ready, go full bore.

26:46.880 --> 26:49.440
Now, of course, what have we all been talking about right here?

26:49.440 --> 26:51.920
Um, it always sneaks into the discussion somehow.

26:51.920 --> 26:53.760
I don't know, it must be in the name of the show.

26:53.760 --> 26:57.200
But yes, of course, that's the Linux kernel.

26:58.320 --> 27:00.560
And well, there's been some, I don't know,

27:00.560 --> 27:01.680
I'm not going to call it drama,

27:01.680 --> 27:04.560
but there's been some news around some of the remarks

27:04.560 --> 27:07.520
from two of the top people associated with that kernel.

27:07.520 --> 27:10.160
And of course, that would be Linus and his right hand man,

27:10.160 --> 27:11.520
Greg K. H.

27:12.640 --> 27:15.760
Over at the recent open source summit in North America,

27:15.760 --> 27:18.080
Greg warned some attendees about the severe impact that,

27:18.080 --> 27:19.200
of course, we've all been talking about,

27:19.200 --> 27:20.960
which has been Meltdown and Spectre,

27:20.960 --> 27:23.120
the CPU vulnerabilities that have been flagging

27:23.120 --> 27:27.680
modern out of order processors for the better part of 2018.

27:29.200 --> 27:32.640
Really, what's at issue here is responsible disclosure.

27:32.640 --> 27:35.440
And how does that work, especially in a world dominated

27:35.440 --> 27:39.280
by large enterprise distributions and, you know,

27:39.280 --> 27:42.480
two, three, four main hardware providers?

27:42.480 --> 27:44.560
How does open source fit into that picture?

27:44.560 --> 27:47.360
Well, to give an idea, Jan Horn discovered

27:47.360 --> 27:50.720
the first of these issues way back in July, 2017.

27:50.720 --> 27:54.720
And it wasn't until October that some of the kernel community

27:54.720 --> 27:56.400
were starting to hear rumors of the flop.

27:56.400 --> 27:57.680
That's not disclosure of the flop,

27:57.680 --> 28:00.160
that's rumors of the flop.

28:00.160 --> 28:03.520
That's a long time, especially as, you know,

28:03.520 --> 28:06.720
in the same vein, other very large operating system vendors

28:07.280 --> 28:08.880
had already heard the news and really,

28:08.880 --> 28:11.040
it only filtered down to the Linux kernel.

28:11.040 --> 28:12.960
It only filtered down to the Linux community

28:12.960 --> 28:14.720
because some of those vendors told Intel

28:14.720 --> 28:18.000
to just get off their butts and tell people about it.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Well, I remember around Christmas time,

28:20.000 --> 28:21.440
the register put it together, I think,

28:21.440 --> 28:23.440
with the various bits of evidence that they had,

28:23.440 --> 28:26.080
and that basically forced the disclosure.

28:26.080 --> 28:28.000
And then there was a huge scramble

28:28.560 --> 28:33.120
with the various Linux distros and the other OS vendors

28:33.120 --> 28:34.400
to get the patches together.

28:34.400 --> 28:36.960
And by all accounts, it absolutely ruined

28:36.960 --> 28:39.120
the Christmas holidays and New Year time

28:39.120 --> 28:41.760
for a lot of people in those companies.

28:41.760 --> 28:44.720
Yeah, right, they siloed Zeus, they siloed Red Hat,

28:44.720 --> 28:47.520
they siloed Canonical, they never even told Oracle,

28:47.520 --> 28:51.040
and they wouldn't let anyone talk to each other.

28:51.040 --> 28:52.320
And, you know, normally, of course,

28:52.320 --> 28:54.400
you get all the people together, you start talking,

28:54.400 --> 28:55.840
everyone has different resources.

28:55.840 --> 28:58.240
Each company and contributors can pick and choose

28:58.240 --> 29:00.320
the people that know the most about these subsystems,

29:00.320 --> 29:02.080
who has time, who has energy to do this,

29:02.080 --> 29:03.840
group them all together, form a war room,

29:03.840 --> 29:05.600
and actually get stuff patched.

29:05.600 --> 29:07.360
And of course, when it's a security vulnerability,

29:07.360 --> 29:09.920
you want to get that patched as fast as you can.

29:10.720 --> 29:13.040
So really, this process that happened this time around,

29:13.920 --> 29:14.960
it just isn't good enough.

29:15.600 --> 29:18.720
But thankfully, lessons were learned from that.

29:18.720 --> 29:22.800
And both Greg and Linus have said that,

29:22.800 --> 29:24.320
you know, things are a lot better now.

29:24.320 --> 29:27.520
Now they've got back channels to Intel

29:27.520 --> 29:29.680
and, you know, they can all talk to each other.

29:29.680 --> 29:33.280
And you've even got the Windows people

29:33.840 --> 29:36.240
and the Linux people talking together

29:36.240 --> 29:39.200
and working together, which would have just never happened

29:39.200 --> 29:40.240
five or 10 years ago.

29:40.240 --> 29:43.040
So it's almost like the silver lining

29:43.040 --> 29:45.920
of this terrible, terrible cloud of speculative execution

29:46.880 --> 29:48.800
is that we've got people working together

29:48.800 --> 29:50.480
that wouldn't have otherwise.

29:50.480 --> 29:52.640
I was pretty impressed when I read that, Joe.

29:52.640 --> 29:53.520
I will be honest.

29:54.080 --> 29:57.040
Add that to the bucket of, hey, it's a new Microsoft.

29:57.040 --> 29:58.240
But it also makes sense, right?

29:58.240 --> 30:00.320
I mean, largely what they're trying to do,

30:00.320 --> 30:03.600
build operating systems to run on top of Intel's hardware

30:03.600 --> 30:06.320
or, you know, x86 hardware or whatever,

30:07.360 --> 30:08.480
that's the same job.

30:08.480 --> 30:10.400
And it would make sense where appropriate

30:10.400 --> 30:13.280
to share resources, share insights and share knowledge,

30:13.280 --> 30:14.880
especially because as we've seen,

30:14.880 --> 30:17.920
a lot of these speculative execution attacks are complicated.

30:17.920 --> 30:20.160
And especially when they first released,

30:20.160 --> 30:22.000
this was a new type of vulnerability

30:22.000 --> 30:24.240
that no one really understood very well

30:24.240 --> 30:27.280
and is really ingrained in the core parts

30:27.280 --> 30:29.920
of how modern out of order processing happens

30:29.920 --> 30:32.160
and some very clever attacks therein.

30:32.160 --> 30:35.440
And of course, you have to remember that these attacks,

30:35.440 --> 30:37.680
although they do render client machines,

30:37.680 --> 30:39.280
desktops kind of vulnerable,

30:39.920 --> 30:42.880
really the biggest problems are on servers

30:42.880 --> 30:44.880
and especially with virtualization.

30:44.880 --> 30:49.040
And that's a huge part of Microsoft's business now

30:49.040 --> 30:52.240
is virtualization and a lot of it's running Linux.

30:52.240 --> 30:53.760
Microsoft loves the Linux and all that.

30:54.320 --> 30:56.480
So, you know, it's not a surprise

30:56.480 --> 30:59.680
that they are now working with the Linux community on this

30:59.680 --> 31:00.560
because they're working with them.

31:00.560 --> 31:02.480
You know, look what they're doing with Canonical

31:02.480 --> 31:05.760
to get the subsystem into the Windows desktop.

31:06.240 --> 31:08.960
We're seeing a lot more cross-pollination here.

31:09.520 --> 31:12.880
And it's, you know, a cynical person might say

31:12.880 --> 31:14.800
that it's Microsoft trying to, you know,

31:14.800 --> 31:16.560
embrace extend and extinguish.

31:16.560 --> 31:20.240
But I always say this, it's about them making money.

31:20.240 --> 31:21.440
They're just following the money

31:21.440 --> 31:23.360
and the money's in Linux out of source.

31:23.360 --> 31:25.440
And that's why they're getting into that.

31:25.440 --> 31:27.040
This all makes me curious.

31:27.040 --> 31:30.640
Okay, so maybe it's as we've heard today.

31:30.640 --> 31:32.240
Maybe Intel's learned a lesson from this.

31:32.240 --> 31:33.360
They're gonna do better next time

31:33.360 --> 31:36.480
and I'm sure there will be a next time sooner rather than later.

31:37.040 --> 31:38.240
That's all well and good.

31:38.240 --> 31:40.480
But what happens when AMD, you know,

31:40.480 --> 31:42.880
Ryzen really takes off, AMD is the dominant

31:42.880 --> 31:44.640
or Intel just can never compete.

31:44.640 --> 31:46.960
Mobile operating systems become the norm.

31:46.960 --> 31:50.640
And, you know, we're dealing with Taiwanese semiconductor.

31:51.440 --> 31:53.920
Is this gonna be a battle we have to keep fighting

31:53.920 --> 31:56.480
as one dominant or several dominant companies?

31:56.480 --> 31:58.160
Come into play, fade away.

31:58.160 --> 32:00.400
I imagine that a lot of these open source communities

32:00.400 --> 32:04.000
will last a good bit longer or have that kind of staying power.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.760
So are these constant battles?

32:05.760 --> 32:08.480
Or can we actually reach a cultural norm

32:08.480 --> 32:10.240
where people understand how to make this work

32:10.240 --> 32:13.280
and understand and can navigate the complex relationships?

32:13.280 --> 32:15.600
Well, there's one obvious answer to all of this

32:15.600 --> 32:19.200
and that is to go to RISC-V, a properly open instruction set

32:19.200 --> 32:22.800
rather than having to rely on Intel and AMD and ARM

32:23.280 --> 32:24.880
where there's all sorts of things going on

32:24.880 --> 32:26.640
that we just don't understand, you know.

32:26.640 --> 32:28.640
The future has to be something.

32:28.640 --> 32:31.440
If it's not RISC-V, it has to be something similar, doesn't it?

32:31.440 --> 32:32.960
It does seem to be that way.

32:32.960 --> 32:35.520
We are obviously running against physical limits

32:35.520 --> 32:36.800
in our current architectures.

32:36.800 --> 32:40.480
And a lot of these difficulties are a result

32:40.480 --> 32:44.240
of just how darn complicated everything that we do these days are.

32:44.240 --> 32:47.600
We haven't, you know, x86 has a lot of legacy built in,

32:47.600 --> 32:50.080
even though we're all really running, you know,

32:50.080 --> 32:53.600
the more modern 64 variant, there's still a lot going on.

32:53.600 --> 32:56.160
We have this, this CISC architecture architectures

32:56.160 --> 33:00.240
on top of really like a RISC core, complicated firmwares.

33:00.240 --> 33:02.800
We were just talking about it in a recent episode of this show,

33:02.800 --> 33:05.360
the complicated licenses that go around that.

33:05.360 --> 33:08.640
If you could start with something a little more peer, right?

33:08.640 --> 33:13.280
Yeah, something like RISC-V, something where you've got an open foundation,

33:13.280 --> 33:16.960
you can pick a retailer or a foundry that can make that hardware for you

33:16.960 --> 33:20.720
that you choose and then you can take the open source operating system

33:20.720 --> 33:22.240
you want to run on top of it.

33:22.240 --> 33:24.480
You're getting me excited and also really upset

33:24.480 --> 33:26.560
because I can't really do that right now.

33:26.560 --> 33:29.760
And you can't even trust your operating system and processor together

33:29.760 --> 33:32.960
to give you truly random numbers, can you? Or can you?

33:32.960 --> 33:35.360
Or can you? You know, that's a good question.

33:35.360 --> 33:40.240
We've seen a lot of controversy about this over the years.

33:40.240 --> 33:45.280
Way back in 2013, you may remember there was calls on the mailing list

33:45.280 --> 33:48.560
to ditch Intel's RD-RAND instruction,

33:48.560 --> 33:52.640
which can be used to help provide secure sources of random numbers.

33:52.640 --> 33:55.120
And, you know, there was a lot of pushback then.

33:55.120 --> 33:57.040
There was a lot of saying, like, well, can we really trust this?

33:57.040 --> 33:58.480
We don't know what's going on.

33:58.480 --> 34:00.800
At the time, the kernel community really was saying that,

34:00.800 --> 34:02.640
well, we already use multiple sources of input.

34:02.640 --> 34:05.440
We mix them together in a secure and trustworthy way.

34:05.440 --> 34:07.600
So you really, you just shouldn't have to worry about this.

34:07.600 --> 34:09.680
But of course, when there's big corporations involved

34:09.680 --> 34:13.680
and black boxed microcode, I can understand why you'd be suspicious.

34:13.680 --> 34:16.400
So this week, we have some news.

34:16.400 --> 34:21.920
Linux kernel version 419 RC1, which was just published,

34:21.920 --> 34:25.520
allows those building their own kernel to choose whether or not

34:25.520 --> 34:30.640
to trust particular CPU hardware run random number generation.

34:30.640 --> 34:34.400
Now, of course, when random number generation is insufficiently random,

34:34.400 --> 34:38.800
everything you do on a computer that relies on that core source of entropy,

34:38.800 --> 34:42.000
it's just, it's not really going to work.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.280
One solution to this has been having external hardware

34:45.280 --> 34:46.480
sources of randomness.

34:46.480 --> 34:47.440
You have hardware keys.

34:47.440 --> 34:50.400
You have things scavenged from radioactive decay.

34:50.400 --> 34:53.200
There's all sorts of techniques to get around this, right?

34:53.200 --> 34:56.000
Cloudflare has a wall of lava lamps at their headquarters

34:56.000 --> 35:00.160
where they use cameras to sample the lava lamp state

35:00.160 --> 35:02.800
and use that as a source of random numbers.

35:02.800 --> 35:06.160
These days, hardware manufacturers have gotten wind that people want this,

35:06.160 --> 35:08.080
and they've been building it in.

35:08.080 --> 35:11.360
That makes a rather complicated trust arrangement.

35:11.360 --> 35:14.080
Yeah, do you trust the likes of Intel?

35:14.080 --> 35:17.680
Not necessarily to not be nefarious, but just to not be incompetent.

35:17.680 --> 35:20.480
I mean, look what they did with speculative execution.

35:20.480 --> 35:22.320
That wasn't them deliberately doing that.

35:22.320 --> 35:24.960
That was just them not stopping to think about it.

35:24.960 --> 35:28.160
And so if they can't get that right, then why should I trust that they're going

35:28.160 --> 35:30.400
to get the random number generation right?

35:30.400 --> 35:32.640
I like how this was described.

35:32.640 --> 35:37.280
There's a recent patch, and it's determined that it's been punting

35:37.280 --> 35:42.240
the controversy into the laps of Linux distributions and kernel builders.

35:42.240 --> 35:47.760
If enabled, the random trust CPU flag prevents the kernel's get random system call

35:47.760 --> 35:51.200
from blocking the boot process in order to accumulate enough entropy.

35:51.200 --> 35:54.720
This, you know, that can hasten the boot process, which has some benefits,

35:54.720 --> 35:59.360
but obviously that makes it so that you have less certainty in your cryptographic strength.

35:59.360 --> 36:03.520
Now, this setting would apply not only to that RD rand instruction

36:03.520 --> 36:08.800
that we talked about before, but also RD seed, which works for both Intel and AMD chips,

36:08.800 --> 36:11.680
as well as random number generators that are built into some of the other

36:11.680 --> 36:14.320
built into some of IBM's power PC chips.

36:14.320 --> 36:18.560
But at what point do you just stop worrying and just get on with it?

36:18.560 --> 36:23.040
You know, do you spend your entire life just paranoid about these things?

36:23.040 --> 36:26.160
And, you know, is it providing enough entropy?

36:26.160 --> 36:30.960
And, you know, at the end of the day, does anyone care enough to attack you?

36:30.960 --> 36:34.640
And, you know, that's not a great attitude to have from a security point of view.

36:34.640 --> 36:38.960
Obviously, you want things to be as secure as possible, but you always have to weigh up

36:38.960 --> 36:42.240
that choice, don't you, between usability and security.

36:42.240 --> 36:47.920
And, you know, what other choice do you have but to trust these hardware vendors, really?

36:47.920 --> 36:53.040
Unfortunately, at least for individual users, really not much of a choice.

36:53.040 --> 36:57.760
Now, maybe if you're a big vendor or a big manufacturer or one of those big Internet

36:57.760 --> 36:59.440
companies, you might have more say in this.

36:59.440 --> 37:02.080
You might have the ability to fabricate some of your own hardware.

37:02.800 --> 37:06.400
But I can see it being a prudent choice for the kernel developers because

37:06.400 --> 37:08.080
it just gets them out of the decision.

37:08.080 --> 37:14.480
I imagine a lot of distributions will just ship this same as it has ever been and not

37:14.480 --> 37:15.280
enabled.

37:15.280 --> 37:17.200
But, you know, who's to say?

37:17.200 --> 37:19.360
And if you are a purist, you have that option.

37:19.360 --> 37:23.200
I, for one, well, I'm not doing anything secure enough to really care.

37:23.200 --> 37:29.040
And I already have so much implicit trust in every company that plays a part in manufacturing

37:29.040 --> 37:31.760
anything that runs on all of my computing devices.

37:31.760 --> 37:33.040
There's not a lot of gain.

37:33.040 --> 37:34.720
But, hey, it's cool.

37:34.720 --> 37:36.960
It's a small patch set, which I was pretty impressed with.

37:36.960 --> 37:39.920
So that makes me think at least this is a good it's a good framework.

37:39.920 --> 37:42.240
It's a good idea that you have options.

37:42.240 --> 37:43.680
They might not even be practical options.

37:43.680 --> 37:47.680
But if it makes it a more usable kernel for everyone, even if I'm not going to use it,

37:47.680 --> 37:49.200
well, I support the idea.

37:49.200 --> 37:49.440
Yeah.

37:49.440 --> 37:53.440
And even if you can't trust your CPU hardware, you basically can't trust any of the other

37:53.440 --> 37:54.080
hardware, can you?

37:54.080 --> 37:55.040
It's all got firmware in it.

37:55.040 --> 37:57.120
Even your SSD and everything has got firmware.

37:57.120 --> 37:59.520
And, you know, we've talked about being able to update that.

37:59.520 --> 38:02.640
But that's all just binary blobs that we have no idea what it's doing.

38:02.640 --> 38:07.920
And so at some point, you just have to relax and just use your hardware and just get on

38:07.920 --> 38:08.480
with it.

38:08.480 --> 38:11.680
It's all shifty turtles all the way down, Joe.

38:11.680 --> 38:12.160
Yeah.

38:13.200 --> 38:16.080
So you've got a couple of picks to share with us.

38:16.080 --> 38:16.640
Yeah.

38:16.640 --> 38:21.520
You know, it just wouldn't be a good Linux unplugged if we didn't sneak in a few picks

38:21.520 --> 38:22.800
here and there.

38:22.800 --> 38:26.000
First up, something called Proven.

38:26.480 --> 38:29.920
Proven is an alternative to Twitter's verified program.

38:29.920 --> 38:34.720
But, oh, my friends, but it's powered by Keybase.

38:34.720 --> 38:40.320
Proven is a browser extension that has badges for Keybase, GitHub, and a number of online

38:40.320 --> 38:46.080
services next to usernames on some sites, especially Twitter, much like Twitter's verified

38:46.080 --> 38:46.640
badge.

38:46.640 --> 38:51.200
But instead, it's based on the user-hosted proofs Keybase enables.

38:51.200 --> 38:51.680
Yeah.

38:51.680 --> 38:55.920
And to be honest, these days, the Twitter verified badge is pretty much worthless, isn't

38:55.920 --> 38:56.400
it?

38:56.400 --> 38:58.320
So this is much more valuable to me.

38:58.320 --> 39:00.320
Yeah, you know, Keybase has done a lot of things.

39:00.320 --> 39:04.560
We haven't talked about it too much on Linux Unplugged recently, but they've been working

39:04.560 --> 39:09.360
hard in the background to establish a sane way to build distributed trust that doesn't

39:09.360 --> 39:11.760
all have to be based on key signing parties.

39:12.240 --> 39:17.360
Now, if you use their service, you've got some verifiable accounts set up, you've posted

39:17.360 --> 39:21.520
some proofs to services, we all interact on this internet.

39:21.520 --> 39:26.160
And knowing that I can actually have some trust that you are you and that someone I've

39:26.160 --> 39:29.440
talked to on IRC, and someone I've seen in the comments of Hacker News, and then someone's

39:29.440 --> 39:34.480
Twitter feed are all actually the same identity, even if it's a pseudo-anonymous identity,

39:35.280 --> 39:36.880
there's a lot that I like there.

39:36.880 --> 39:40.240
In addition, Keybase has done a lot of neat things like they've got their own distributed

39:40.240 --> 39:45.360
file system that you can check out and a chat app I haven't tried, but I'm very curious.

39:45.360 --> 39:46.640
Yeah, that sounds very interesting.

39:46.640 --> 39:51.280
I've only heard of it today, when we were talking about this before, and I had no idea

39:51.280 --> 39:56.080
that they did so much more than just, you know, this verification stuff.

39:56.080 --> 39:58.240
So yeah, I'm going to definitely have to check that out.

39:58.240 --> 40:01.360
Although, do we really need another chat app at this point?

40:01.360 --> 40:02.480
No, probably not.

40:02.480 --> 40:07.280
Although, if it does have security in mind, well, I'm tempted.

40:07.280 --> 40:12.160
If you're curious, though, don't worry, you can head on over to linuxunplugged.com

40:12.160 --> 40:16.000
slash 265 to get a link to everything we've talked about, but also proven.

40:16.000 --> 40:19.120
You can go try it out, see if you like it, see how many I think you might be surprised

40:19.120 --> 40:23.680
how many people are actually on Keybase that you already interact with online.

40:23.680 --> 40:27.120
And if you don't mind one add on, of course, they have one for Firefox and Chrome.

40:27.120 --> 40:29.360
So probably a browser near you.

40:29.360 --> 40:32.720
I don't know, something I've installed and maybe you should too.

40:32.720 --> 40:34.560
That's not the only pic for this week, though, is it?

40:34.560 --> 40:35.600
No, of course not, Joe.

40:35.600 --> 40:36.400
What are you trying to say?

40:36.400 --> 40:38.640
I'm not trying to sell everyone short of the pics.

40:38.640 --> 40:40.000
That would be insane.

40:40.480 --> 40:42.480
Okay, so this one's a little bit weird.

40:42.480 --> 40:43.920
It's got an unfortunate name.

40:44.640 --> 40:46.400
It's called Rat.

40:47.360 --> 40:48.080
Yeah, that's right.

40:48.080 --> 40:49.680
Rat, R-A-T.

40:49.680 --> 40:55.440
And well, I don't know why it's called Rat, but what it lets you do is kind of novel.

40:55.440 --> 41:01.840
It's a tool to compose shell commands to build interactive terminal applications.

41:02.400 --> 41:06.560
This is one you should definitely go follow up, click on those show notes, go over to

41:06.560 --> 41:10.560
their GitHub page and watch some of their demos because it's a little, really, there's

41:10.560 --> 41:11.520
a lot of power here.

41:11.520 --> 41:16.240
I think they've found a unique way to leverage that Unix philosophy we're always prattling

41:16.240 --> 41:19.840
on about here and actually get some pretty usable results.

41:19.840 --> 41:22.240
Have you had a chance to fully check this out then?

41:22.240 --> 41:25.600
Yeah, it's a Go application, so it's really pretty easy to get.

41:26.480 --> 41:30.960
I don't think they have any binaries pre-compiled for you, but if you've got the Go build chain

41:30.960 --> 41:33.920
already installed, it's just a Go get away.

41:33.920 --> 41:39.440
And it was really inspired by things like TIG to have very little actual opinionated

41:39.440 --> 41:42.640
UI logic, but allowing you to stick that in together.

41:42.640 --> 41:46.960
So they've got an example here where they've hooked up various, you can configure various

41:46.960 --> 41:51.360
modes and then trigger that on key presses to show different things.

41:51.360 --> 41:55.360
So their example is maybe you're working in a complicated Git tree and you know you're

41:55.360 --> 41:56.400
going to want multiple panes.

41:56.400 --> 41:59.440
You're going to want to be able to see maybe like the actual tree layout.

41:59.440 --> 42:00.640
You're going to want to see some blames.

42:00.640 --> 42:02.720
You're going to want to see just raw diffs.

42:03.600 --> 42:06.400
This lets you do that and you can do it all interactively.

42:06.400 --> 42:11.040
So you can choose, you can have it show like Git show, you can have it show the Git log.

42:11.040 --> 42:12.560
You can imagine using all sorts of tools.

42:12.560 --> 42:14.880
Maybe you have your whole development environment set up in this.

42:14.880 --> 42:18.160
You've got something watching to show all your tests in one window.

42:18.160 --> 42:21.760
You've enabled it with key presses so that you can rerun those tests or trigger to go

42:21.760 --> 42:24.880
do a build and upload it to a server when you're ready to test it in staging.

42:25.440 --> 42:27.520
I think the possibilities are kind of endless.

42:27.520 --> 42:32.320
Now, of course, that means RAT is a little bit of a power user tool.

42:32.320 --> 42:36.400
You're going to have to get down and gritty with all of that config.

42:36.400 --> 42:39.600
But the upside is it's, you know, it's composable.

42:39.600 --> 42:45.840
It has some really nice, I think, base abstractions and what you could build, I bet, is limitless.

42:45.840 --> 42:49.760
This sounds really interesting, even from a systems administrator perspective.

42:49.760 --> 42:54.720
I'm doing more and more work with SaltStack and I'm trying to pick up Ansible to automate

42:54.720 --> 42:56.480
stuff at work or stuff here at the house.

42:56.480 --> 43:03.120
And it's nice having something like Visual Studio Code.

43:03.120 --> 43:06.320
I like their implementation of Git and that kind of thing and how it's all within the

43:06.320 --> 43:06.880
GUI.

43:06.880 --> 43:09.760
There's days where I just live in VS Code.

43:09.760 --> 43:15.360
But having something like this that is that intricate, I think, would really help, especially

43:15.360 --> 43:20.480
for someone who just within the last few months has started heavily using Git when, you know,

43:20.480 --> 43:25.680
six months ago, 12 months ago, I didn't use Git at all except to pull down new applications.

43:25.680 --> 43:29.120
Yeah, and it seems like one of those things, too, where often you end up with workflows

43:29.120 --> 43:32.800
where on one side you have some scripts that you have to custom set up.

43:32.800 --> 43:37.200
Maybe you've got a script to open them all in Tmux panes, or on the other side of that

43:37.200 --> 43:40.800
spectrum, you've got custom developed web UIs that hook through and maybe you've set

43:40.800 --> 43:43.680
up like a Rails app or an Express app.

43:43.680 --> 43:49.200
To my eye, RAT occupies an interesting middle space where you can actually set up actual

43:49.200 --> 43:54.560
UX workflows on the terminal, relying just on terminal commands that you're already using,

43:54.560 --> 43:56.080
but in a more structured way.

43:56.080 --> 44:01.360
And as someone who always has way too many terminals open, I'll be pointing out that

44:01.360 --> 44:03.280
open, I'll be playing with it.

44:03.280 --> 44:07.120
And you've got yet one more perk, haven't you, tcpdump101.com?

44:07.120 --> 44:10.960
Yeah, this one's not so much of an app as it is a web app.

44:11.920 --> 44:15.760
I don't know about you, Joe, but sometimes there's something shady going on on your network

44:15.760 --> 44:16.560
or on your box.

44:16.560 --> 44:18.000
The kernel's failing you.

44:18.000 --> 44:23.280
You're getting a lot of spam or your packets just aren't going where you told them to go.

44:23.280 --> 44:26.400
That's when I turned to my trusty friend, tcpdump.

44:26.400 --> 44:31.520
Unfortunately, I think for many of us, if it's not one of your daily drivers, it's just

44:31.520 --> 44:35.280
one more tool that you can you forget the language to use to configure it.

44:35.280 --> 44:36.880
You forget all the command line flags.

44:37.440 --> 44:42.960
And to add to that, there's a lot of hardware out there that has somewhat similar commands

44:42.960 --> 44:44.960
that aren't just always the same.

44:45.440 --> 44:53.840
Enter tcpdump101, a handy site that has a simple GUI builder to help you compose tcpdump

44:53.840 --> 44:54.720
commands.

44:54.720 --> 44:57.280
This looks super useful to me, man.

44:57.280 --> 44:57.760
Yeah, that's it.

44:57.760 --> 45:00.320
Because like tcpdump, it has a lot of functionality.

45:00.320 --> 45:04.480
And usually, I saw a lot of outcries of people discussing this tool being like, well, you

45:04.480 --> 45:05.840
know, it already has a man page.

45:05.840 --> 45:08.000
And you can just type dash h.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.280
And that's all true.

45:09.280 --> 45:11.440
And you know, we probably do that already.

45:11.440 --> 45:12.320
I know I do.

45:13.360 --> 45:15.600
But it's nowhere near as in depth of this.

45:15.600 --> 45:17.600
And there's some amount of shame.

45:17.600 --> 45:20.560
I think we like to we like to put a stigma on people that need help, right?

45:20.560 --> 45:24.080
Maybe you're always going to stack overflow or you just can't learn to memorize those

45:24.080 --> 45:25.440
command line switches.

45:25.440 --> 45:29.360
But all that matters at the end of the day is you have a powerful tool and you want to

45:29.360 --> 45:30.000
be able to use it.

45:30.000 --> 45:33.040
And if you don't use it every day, you might need a little help.

45:33.040 --> 45:36.640
That's where things like query builders or planners really come in.

45:36.640 --> 45:37.600
And they've got different stuff.

45:37.600 --> 45:40.480
So maybe you're using a Cisco ASA checkpoint thing.

45:40.480 --> 45:43.120
FortisGate doesn't really matter.

45:43.120 --> 45:44.960
Just plain old good tcpdump.

45:44.960 --> 45:46.880
They've got a handy GUI you can click through.

45:46.880 --> 45:48.480
It'll help you graph all the options.

45:48.480 --> 45:50.480
You enter your capture interface.

45:50.480 --> 45:53.040
You've got a whole bunch of sort of where do you want to save this output?

45:53.040 --> 45:54.480
What's the format that you want to save it?

45:54.480 --> 46:00.240
And at the end, you're given a command to copy, paste in your terminal and away you go.

46:00.240 --> 46:00.800
Very nice.

46:01.520 --> 46:04.800
Well, Joe, I think that's the end of the picks.

46:04.800 --> 46:08.880
And unless you've got anything else you'd like to add today, I think that's going to

46:08.880 --> 46:11.360
wrap up Linux Unplugged 265.

46:11.360 --> 46:13.760
Yeah, I think we did an OK job while the boss is away.

46:13.760 --> 46:15.280
You know, it was definitely a quick episode.

46:15.280 --> 46:19.120
There's been lots going on over here, but never fear.

46:19.120 --> 46:21.120
You can't stop Linux Unplugged and you can't stop

46:21.120 --> 46:23.200
Jupiter Broadcasting.

46:23.200 --> 46:25.840
You're probably saying that wasn't enough Linux Unplugged for me.

46:25.840 --> 46:26.400
And you know what?

46:26.400 --> 46:26.880
I feel you.

46:26.880 --> 46:27.680
So don't worry.

46:27.680 --> 46:28.800
We'll be back next week.

46:28.800 --> 46:31.360
You can you can tune in, join the mumble room.

46:31.360 --> 46:33.280
We do this thing at 2 p.m.

46:33.280 --> 46:34.400
Pacific time.

46:34.400 --> 46:36.400
Jupiter Broadcasting dot com for a whole bunch more.

46:36.400 --> 46:41.680
But Jupiter Broadcasting dot com slash calendar to get that converted to your local time.

46:41.680 --> 46:46.560
You can go to Linux Unplugged dot com slash 265 to get all the details and show notes.

46:46.560 --> 46:49.520
And of course, Linux Unplugged dot com slash subscribe.

46:49.520 --> 46:53.360
If you want to just make sure you always get the latest Linux Unplugged.

46:54.480 --> 46:56.960
Of course, we have won many wonderful contributors.

46:56.960 --> 46:59.680
You get to be a part of this mumble room if you want to.

46:59.680 --> 47:00.720
Please do join us.

47:00.720 --> 47:01.680
It's always a lot of fun.

47:02.720 --> 47:06.880
You can, of course, find the wonderful poppy over at the Ubuntu podcast.

47:06.880 --> 47:09.440
And you can find Joe while all over the place.

47:09.440 --> 47:10.720
He's at Joe Ressington.

47:10.720 --> 47:13.760
And make sure you check out Linux Action News this week.

47:13.760 --> 47:16.640
And the always fabulous late night Linux.

47:16.640 --> 47:19.440
I'm at Westpane and the whole darn network.

47:19.440 --> 47:22.480
Well, that's at Jupiter Signal.

47:22.480 --> 47:24.080
Thank you for joining me so much, Joe.

47:24.080 --> 47:53.520
We'll see you maybe next week.

47:54.080 --> 48:01.360
Thanks for joining us, everyone.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.440
Sorry it was a short one today.

48:03.440 --> 48:05.120
I wish I had more to contribute.

48:05.120 --> 48:06.720
Yeah, I just didn't have much to add today.

48:07.280 --> 48:09.120
I feel like I should have had more to say.

48:09.120 --> 48:12.080
More more in my head to say about 3.3.0,

48:12.080 --> 48:14.400
since I'm supposed to be helping with our social media for it.

48:15.840 --> 48:17.360
I was too busy enjoying a steak.

48:18.080 --> 48:20.960
Think about it and be ready for next week's Unplugged, sir.

48:21.600 --> 48:23.040
Yeah, next week's going to be huge.

48:23.040 --> 48:24.960
I've already got it blocked off on my calendar,

48:24.960 --> 48:28.560
and I'm probably even just going to take a few hours off of work

48:28.560 --> 48:32.000
because between the Libre Application Summit and GNOME 3.3.0,

48:32.000 --> 48:35.040
I'm going to try and make some notes and come properly prepared.

48:35.040 --> 48:35.840
Oh, excellent.

48:35.840 --> 48:38.000
You're a blessing to us all.

48:38.000 --> 48:41.520
All my thoughts are around the conference I'm driving out to tomorrow.

48:41.520 --> 48:44.320
I'm really excited to get away from my routine,

48:44.320 --> 48:47.600
get away from the house and take a few days off work

48:47.600 --> 48:49.520
and just hang out with a bunch of other nerds.

48:49.520 --> 48:50.720
Which conference is that then?

48:50.720 --> 48:53.600
Oh, that would be the Libre Application Summit, right, Eric?

48:53.600 --> 48:54.640
No, Wes listens to me.

48:54.640 --> 48:55.840
I sure do.

48:55.840 --> 48:56.340
Yeah.

48:56.880 --> 49:00.240
I was going to say, I didn't want to presume I had heard you talking about it.

49:00.240 --> 49:01.840
Yeah, that sounds really cool, man.

49:01.840 --> 49:04.480
There's going to be people from all sorts of communities there, aren't there?

49:04.480 --> 49:06.240
Yeah, it's going to be nice to meet.

49:06.880 --> 49:10.080
In particular, I'm looking forward to meeting the folks from elementary,

49:10.080 --> 49:15.200
talk to both of them quite a bit on the show and IRC and that kind of thing.

49:15.200 --> 49:18.880
So it'll be fun to just get to meet a bunch of these folks in person.

49:18.880 --> 49:22.080
You know, you really just can't replace that in-person feeling.

49:22.080 --> 49:24.560
Even if you get to talk to them every week here,

49:24.560 --> 49:26.400
there's something about seeing someone in person,

49:26.400 --> 49:30.960
giving them a hug and just having some time to hash out everything you want to talk about.

49:30.960 --> 49:31.920
You just can't replace.

49:31.920 --> 49:34.320
Yeah, and you can't replace that hangover feel the next day

49:34.320 --> 49:36.320
after you've been out for drinks all night.

49:36.320 --> 49:37.760
No, that's an important aspect.

49:38.880 --> 49:40.960
Yeah, I take it there's going to be plenty of that as well then.

49:40.960 --> 49:44.080
Oh, there's plans flying around and they're trying to figure out

49:44.080 --> 49:46.400
how much of a budget there is for drink tokens.

49:46.400 --> 49:49.760
It's like, no, no, we don't need drink tokens, that would just make it worse.

49:50.720 --> 49:51.600
Right, yeah.

49:51.600 --> 49:53.280
You want a self-limiting supply.

49:53.280 --> 49:54.240
Yeah, exactly.

49:54.240 --> 49:55.440
Oh, I'm really envious now.

49:55.440 --> 49:58.240
I really wanted to go to that, but unfortunately it was the wrong time of year.

49:58.240 --> 50:00.560
Yeah, you'll really have to be the ambassador there, Eric.

50:00.560 --> 50:01.680
I'm excited for that.

50:01.680 --> 50:05.680
I was toying with the idea of taking my setup here

50:06.320 --> 50:08.560
just in case there's some thoughts or something I want to record.

50:08.560 --> 50:13.280
But I've also set up a one-click ghost deployment on DigitalOcean.

50:13.280 --> 50:16.000
And I'm just going to try and, if nothing else,

50:16.000 --> 50:20.800
I'm just going to try and start blogging about everything that happens just to record it.

50:20.800 --> 50:21.680
Oh, excellent.

50:21.680 --> 50:43.680
Yeah, that would be a good read.
