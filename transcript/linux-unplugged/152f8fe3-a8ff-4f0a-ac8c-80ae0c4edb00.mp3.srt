1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
Do you guys see that Google is going to be shipping, it looks almost all but confirmed

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:12,000
right now, that Google is going to offer a Google Home Mini October 19th for $50.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,720
At least it'll be on pre-order October 19th.

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,280
So this is like to compete with the Echo Dot.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,720
So they're really pushing into this home cheapo automation stuff.

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,720
I think that's interesting.

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,200
It is interesting tech.

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:32,320
I mean, the thing is, of course, it sends everything you do to Google and, well, yeah.

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,720
Yeah, I'm not sure which company I trust more.

10
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,760
You know, isn't that a horrible position to be in just to begin with?

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,880
Like that position itself is just awful.

12
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,040
Yeah, to have everything you mean being Google.

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,640
Yeah, and or even just having to pick between the worst evil.

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,000
Which evil do I want to utilize?

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,040
Do I want to utilize the evil that wants to track and sell ads?

16
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,040
Or do I want to utilize-

17
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,040
It's like the past election cycle.

18
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,040
Right.

19
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,040
Yeah, it is.

20
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,840
Or do I want to utilize the evil that wants to put a Walmart in my house?

21
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,640
Which one do I want to go with?

22
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,640
It's kind of awful.

23
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,700
Yeah, I mean, even if these companies don't necessarily do or want to do something evil

24
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:15,660
at the moment, first of all, they can inadvertently do something evil.

25
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,880
You know, like with Facebook, the effect it can have on elections is massive, even if

26
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,880
they don't try to.

27
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,880
Right.

28
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,840
Well, and also it's sort of like the universe is constantly expanding.

29
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,800
The need for profit is constantly expanding.

30
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:32,720
And when you've extinguished all your existing paths to revenue, you're going to have to

31
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,720
take it.

32
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,640
You almost legally have to take advantage of other paths to revenue.

33
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,640
Absolutely.

34
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,640
That's the other thing, right?

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,640
I mean, there's this constant pressure.

36
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,640
I mean, it's the same with Apple.

37
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:47,740
They're now doing a huge amount of good stuff when it comes to security and privacy and

38
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,740
all this stuff.

39
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,800
But you have to realize there's a constant pressure on them to increase their profits.

40
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,720
And if they can't keep selling more expensive iPhones, I mean, at the moment, the maximum

41
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,160
doesn't seem in sight, but there will be a day that it will cost more than a car.

42
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,160
Yeah.

43
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,160
Yeah.

44
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,160
You know, they're just going to start selling cars.

45
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,160
They're going to have to look for another business model.

46
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,160
Yeah.

47
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,160
$10,000 iPhone.

48
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,160
Yeah.

49
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,480
The Daily Mail actually did an article today, 10 cars you could buy instead of an iPhone

50
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,480
10.

51
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,480
No kidding.

52
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,480
Right.

53
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,480
Yeah.

54
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,480
Yeah.

55
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,760
Let's yeah, let's not kid that is getting it is they are literally getting to the cost.

56
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,440
These are really getting to the cost of a, you know, a used car.

57
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,020
That is really something, isn't it?

58
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,920
And you know, so you have, you have Apple that's kind of getting into this space with

59
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,620
their HomePod in December, and that'll be interesting to see what it can do if it does

60
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,360
the base minimums and what it reports home.

61
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,840
And they appear to be doing a lot of investment in on box hardware, like in the HomePod, they

62
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,200
have an A8 Apple CPU to do a lot of local thinking instead of shunting it off to the

63
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,260
cloud.

64
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,960
Maybe that'll make it a more competitive product.

65
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:58,940
But right now, like Eric was just saying, you know, it really to me feels like I'm always

66
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:03,060
constantly picking between the worst evil, either it's, it's iOS or Android, or it's

67
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:09,560
Google Assistant or the Echo, it's, it's just all these different compromises in technology

68
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,480
now.

69
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:28,080
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 217 for October 3rd, 2017.

70
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,960
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that still smells a little bit like

71
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,960
New York.

72
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,960
My name is Chris.

73
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,960
My name is Wes.

74
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,960
Hello, Wes.

75
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,960
The beard's out today.

76
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,220
I think he's trying to build a Gen 2 box.

77
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,220
Is that right?

78
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,220
He would be.

79
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,220
That beard.

80
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,220
He's building the Gen 2.

81
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,220
I'm inspired.

82
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,880
You know, Wes, that's okay though, because even without the beard, somehow we are going

83
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,920
to manage to have a great show this week.

84
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,160
Very excited to be back.

85
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,920
I've brought with me all of the secrets from Canonical.

86
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,920
You look excited, Shipper.

87
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,920
I am.

88
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,920
You're talking quick.

89
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,920
You're right.

90
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,920
I think you're stoked for some Linux.

91
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,920
I am fired up.

92
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,920
You're right.

93
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,920
I am very fired up about this.

94
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,040
I had a great time in New York, had a great time at the Ubuntu rally.

95
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:09,160
And I set out to really figure out how a company like Canonical actually gets work done.

96
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,360
And I walked away with some real insights.

97
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,360
So we'll talk about those.

98
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,680
Got a couple of interviews we're going to play on the show.

99
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,320
Plus, we got some community news.

100
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,600
One story in particular that I'm so excited about, I almost want to do it twice in the

101
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,600
show.

102
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,200
So we're not going to, but I almost want to.

103
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,200
I'm on guard for that now.

104
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,200
You watch out.

105
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,200
I think it's going to be big.

106
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,840
Not only good, but also bad.

107
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,480
So it's one of those shows where it's really got a lot of stuff.

108
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:36,060
Plus, later on in the show, Frank and Yos from Nextcloud are going to join us and talk

109
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:41,760
about the new client-side end-to-end encryption that they're rolling into Nextcloud.

110
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,760
Exciting stuff.

111
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,680
They're doing it in a unique way that totally avoids browser compromises.

112
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,440
And unlike some other projects, they're doing it with a bit of humble pie.

113
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,440
So we'll tell you about that.

114
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,520
Plus, our friends over at Canonical, Opie, has launched the Ubuntu Community Hub.

115
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,200
And we'll talk a little bit about that.

116
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,900
So much stuff to get into, plus another Linux event that's just around the corner.

117
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,640
We can't go any further without saying hello to the virtual lug.

118
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,120
Time-appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

119
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,920
Time, you whiny.

120
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,920
Hello.

121
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,480
Hello, guys.

122
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,960
So I don't have it for you today.

123
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,560
But I think next week, I think, I'm thinking about it.

124
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,760
I want to make sure I'm ready.

125
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:28,080
But I think next week, I'm going to review the Librem 15, the new Librem 15.

126
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,720
So I haven't talked a lot about it on the show.

127
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,600
I'm not sure how much I've said.

128
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,680
But you guys are probably, if you've listened to the show for a while, familiar with my

129
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,840
history with purism.

130
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:45,600
And I crowdfunded one of their first laptops, literally their first laptop, and was underwhelmed

131
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,600
in the results.

132
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,520
Actually, though, in full disclosure, still using it today as a production machine.

133
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,560
So how bad can it actually be?

134
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,540
But you know, predominantly, I had issues with the fan.

135
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,440
And I kind of gave it a mixed review.

136
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,320
And over the last, I don't know, what has it been, two years, purism has decided to

137
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:09,640
make good on the original machine and has shipped me, and I'm going to swap, I'm going

138
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:18,860
to send back the old one, a brand new Librem 15, latest and greatest Librem 15 from purism.

139
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,400
And I decided to put it to the ultimate test.

140
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,680
And I took it with me.

141
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,800
It was the machine I took to the Ubuntu rally.

142
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800
Is that right?

143
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,160
I've spent a lot of time with this machine on the road.

144
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,220
And so next week on the show, I'm going to try to give that a full review.

145
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,520
But this week, we have to talk about the Ubuntu rally, and we have to get into some community

146
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,220
news first.

147
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,880
There's a story that I'm equally excited and equally freaked out about.

148
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,180
And I think it's going to be great for people in production.

149
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,080
I think it's going to be great for Android handsets.

150
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,520
I think it's going to be great for lazy system on a chip users.

151
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,820
It's going to be horrible for people that want new drivers.

152
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:56,560
But Linux is about to get an extended support version of the kernel like we've never seen

153
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,560
before.

154
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,280
So you're familiar with things like Ubuntu LTS and Red Hat Enterprise Server.

155
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,440
But one of the things you might not really think about is one of the things that one

156
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,500
of the real values that these enterprise and LTS distributions is offering is a kernel

157
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,960
that doesn't change that they backport all the shit to.

158
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,780
All the stuff that breaks, all the vulnerabilities.

159
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,380
Some companies call it hardware enablement.

160
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,080
There's different names for it.

161
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,620
But all these things that you push back into an older version of the kernel to kind of

162
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,840
make it look like a new version of the kernel.

163
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,840
And your cynical host here has often called this a fork of Linux.

164
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,800
These distributions are a fork.

165
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,560
They don't ship mainstream upstream Linux.

166
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,520
They fork it and they run their own patches against it and you're running their fork of

167
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,520
Linux.

168
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,600
Red Hat Enterprise Linux is their version of Linux because there is no long term support

169
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,600
kernel.

170
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,360
As hard as Greg K.H. has worked over the years, the longest support we have for a Linux kernel

171
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,840
has been two years.

172
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,360
That's changing now.

173
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,480
Linux's LTS release will now be maintained for six years.

174
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,480
That's a huge jump.

175
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,760
That's a long time.

176
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,720
Greg K.H. will still be maintaining the releases beginning with kernel 4.4.

177
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,280
The LTS cycle is going to be extended for six years.

178
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,800
Now that's big because a lot of project treble devices are using kernel 4.4.

179
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,840
Kernel 4.14 is the next LTS release currently being worked on that would then be supported

180
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,840
until 2023.

181
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,600
That is a long time.

182
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,840
Maybe shipped maybe in time for 18.04.

183
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,600
Wouldn't that be interesting?

184
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:28,080
Now the downside of course is system on a chip vendors could now focus exclusively on

185
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,720
LTS releases and say screw you newer releases and that would suck because waiting around

186
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,840
until after 2023 to get new versions of the drivers would really be a pain in my arse.

187
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:43,400
But overall, I picture running here in the studio, being able to run off the same kernel

188
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,800
for six years.

189
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:51,000
What that functionally gets us is a real targetable, stable set of APIs for hardware manufacturers.

190
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,640
So your black magics, your hodgepodge and all of your reds, all of the other people

191
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,800
that are making camera hardware that has to talk to a host operating system are going

192
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,920
to be in a better position if there's something they can target that stays stable for six

193
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,920
years.

194
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,120
That's about as good as you're ever going to get on Windows and way better than you

195
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,120
get on the Mac.

196
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,440
You mean you won't have to install Ubuntu 10 just to get your drivers to work?

197
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,320
Yeah, just to get your capture card to work.

198
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,320
Which is a thing.

199
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,320
It sure is a thing.

200
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,480
Yeah, and I like this.

201
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,080
I think it's going to be good overall.

202
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,080
It's an interesting...

203
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,160
It seems to be a coming together.

204
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,880
There's maybe an acknowledgement that this sort of thing is happening anyway.

205
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,160
So maybe if we make it official, it'll be better.

206
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,160
I'm on the fence.

207
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,160
I see what you're saying.

208
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,160
I really do like that.

209
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,160
It's good to have official support.

210
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,400
It's good to have long, stable things.

211
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,880
Linux is great for that.

212
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,640
But like your little snip earlier, lazy sys admins, I'm dealing with a lot of that in

213
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,360
my non-show life right now.

214
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:46,320
So it's another reason for people not to build...Change is hard, it sucks, updates, things break.

215
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,760
But unless you build that into your workflow and your day-to-day and have plans for it...

216
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,580
And maybe if that plan is every six years, we will actually move.

217
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,240
And if that's viable, great.

218
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,720
But if it's just another excuse to be surprised in six years when, oh no, we have to get a

219
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,720
new kernel again.

220
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,340
But because you haven't been practicing it every two years, it's a lot harder.

221
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:09,820
So I guess I should probably say, what's really forced this change, this huge commitment change,

222
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:14,200
think about what two years versus six years is in the world of Linux.

223
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,000
I mean, damn, Greg, if you need a beer, let me know, because you're going to need several.

224
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,280
Are we even going to be running Linux in six years?

225
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,280
I don't know.

226
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,720
You know what's pushing this, right?

227
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,120
It's Project Treble from Googs.

228
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,160
It's Googs.

229
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,160
This is for Googs.

230
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,640
I mean, this is for everybody.

231
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,640
But it's for Googs.

232
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,200
Does that mean they won't run away and start running Fuchsia?

233
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,320
I hadn't even thought of that.

234
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,320
Is that what this is about?

235
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,320
I don't know.

236
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,320
It might be a factor, though.

237
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,400
Is this to prevent, because Googs is going to do what Googs wants to do.

238
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,400
That's just what they do.

239
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,400
Yeah.

240
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,280
And Greg's clever enough to say, all right, if this is what it takes to keep one of our

241
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:50,120
biggest customers, hmm.

242
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,120
I like that.

243
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,120
You know what, Wes?

244
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,120
That gets me thinking.

245
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,120
That's good conspiracy bacon.

246
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,120
That's what this show is about.

247
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,120
Plot twist.

248
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,120
Yeah.

249
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,120
So that is a bit of a plot twist.

250
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,720
Speaking of plot twists, Fedora 27 is out.

251
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,720
At least the beta.

252
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,720
Oh, wow.

253
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,720
I should have, geez.

254
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,280
Hey, will you just edit that part out where I said it like that?

255
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,680
That's the beta release of Fedora 27.

256
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,320
And there's not a lot to report here other than you're going to get GNOME 3.26, which

257
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,760
means you're going to get the new display changes and the new network configuration

258
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,420
panels as well as the overall settings panel improvements.

259
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,020
But I thought I was curious.

260
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:33,040
I was watching to see how would the Fedora project, one of the bastions of GNOME 3, how

261
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:39,300
would they handle GNOME dropping the system tray, which to me feels still like a little

262
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,520
user hostile.

263
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:45,920
GNOME says they're doing it for users because tray icons take away your control.

264
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,960
But to me, it's like, well, yeah, but I need that control over things like Dropbox and

265
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,920
Skype and, you know, Nextcloud.

266
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,840
So how does Fedora handle this?

267
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,720
Are they going to ship top icons by default?

268
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,560
Are they going to patch GNOME Shell?

269
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,200
Whoops, they're kind of right in the middle.

270
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
Yeah.

271
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,760
But we now know.

272
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,840
So the system search now shows more results at once, which is nice.

273
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:15,720
And also, this is a direct quote, and also the antiquated system tray has been removed

274
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,760
to reduce visual clutter and confusion.

275
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,560
The top icons extension is available for use with any application that have not updated

276
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,560
yet.

277
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,320
Yeah, they basically are.

278
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,200
They're all in on the same thing that GNOME is doing.

279
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,200
Yeah, they are.

280
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,680
What do you think of that?

281
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,040
It's awful, but not surprising in any way whatsoever.

282
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,720
Do you think it's also user hostile, or am I just being a snowflake here?

283
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,360
It's absolutely user hostile in the sense that the entire community, one of the most

284
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,240
popular extensions of GNOME extensions is top icon for the reason why it's one of the

285
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,240
most popular.

286
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,240
Yeah.

287
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,240
Yeah.

288
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,320
So they're like, oh, you know, community, you like this extension, nah, nah, screw it.

289
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,320
No, we're not going to.

290
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,000
We're going to go ahead and remove that.

291
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,040
They're kicking the legacy applications to the curb.

292
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,040
Screw you guys.

293
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,520
That's not even the worst part.

294
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,120
The fact that they're removing the tray is annoying.

295
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,760
It's the fact that they're removing the API, which makes it broken.

296
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,760
Okay.

297
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,320
So the top icons people announced that they're going to deprecate it.

298
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,640
So yes, Fedora, you're right, it is available for now.

299
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,680
But they've also said that it's gone.

300
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:27,720
So because the GTK 4 API has removed it entirely, top icon just breaks.

301
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,720
Right.

302
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,680
So this is an interesting split in the different implementations we now see of GNOME Shell.

303
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,720
This particular change by GNOME Shell is going to force all the different distro maintainers

304
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,320
that ship GNOME as their default desktop to show their cards.

305
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,400
We already know what 1710 is doing.

306
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,400
What's Antigros going to do?

307
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,400
What's Manjaro going to do?

308
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,600
What's, you know, all these different distributions that ship GNOME by default, what are they

309
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,600
going to do?

310
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,260
They're all going to have to share their, they're all going to have to put their cards

311
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,420
on the table and show, are they going to switch over to shipping an extension installed

312
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,420
by default?

313
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:00,440
Are they going to ship mainstream GNOME without this critical user functionality feature?

314
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,880
I find this to be a fascinating little rift that's developing here.

315
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,360
And now we see where Fedora falls on this line.

316
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,920
So keep your eyes out for more details on that release soon.

317
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,900
It's interesting to see, like, how do we handle breaking or non-breaking changes?

318
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,220
And I get, like, you know, I'm sure they're limited by having to support these old APIs.

319
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,500
How long should that be?

320
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:24,440
How do we deal with legacy apps that won't be motivated to adopt Linux mainstream?

321
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,400
Or when is Linux mainstream changing too fast?

322
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,400
I don't know.

323
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,400
When has GNOME ever cared about?

324
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,400
That's exactly what I was thinking.

325
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,400
That's exactly what I was thinking.

326
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,520
You know, you've got Skype, you've got Dropbox.

327
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,800
Are they going to care?

328
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:39,960
Well, even if they care, these are companies that can take a year or more to shift directions

329
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,960
and support new things.

330
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,720
I mean, so, producer Michael, what I'm worried about here is, and I've said this before,

331
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,680
but it's not that it's a bad idea in totality.

332
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:54,600
What it is, is that it is an idea that is based on idealism, like, as if they can set

333
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,200
the direction of desktop application development.

334
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,200
Do you agree?

335
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,200
I agree.

336
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,200
That's what they think, yeah.

337
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,840
It's the main thing is that if you look at all environments, you know, even there's an

338
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,680
implementation for Mac, and there definitely is for Windows, but so these companies are

339
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:13,620
making it so that they feel like it's the same experience throughout, so that system

340
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,120
tray icons is something that they're used to and people are used to.

341
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,680
So while it's maybe not an ideal solution in their opinion, it's still the norm and

342
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,440
it's still what people expect to exist.

343
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,440
If you look...

344
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,760
So they just remove it because they want to.

345
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:32,000
So I think if you look at the Mac, the Mac would be an example of a platform that will

346
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
often do this.

347
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,600
They'll try to force application developers to support certain features, but even one

348
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,400
of the compromises on a Mac, if you look at any power user, Mac power users desktop, they've

349
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,880
got tons of icons up in that menu bar.

350
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,440
They've got drop boxes up there, there's tons of applications up there.

351
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,640
So the Mac has the same problem and even Apple can't get away from this.

352
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:03,300
So I find it interesting using the word legacy, which basically means obsolete, right?

353
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:07,640
If you're using the word obsolete, I'm looking at my area in the top right hand corner of

354
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:14,680
my screen and I'm seeing Telegram, Wire, Discord, Steam, Dropbox.

355
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:21,040
Which of those are obsolete and who decided, who became king of the desktop and decided

356
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,040
those were obsolete?

357
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,720
Because those are all current applications that I can install right now, latest bleeding

358
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,480
edge versions, and they all have icons in that area and I value them having them.

359
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,480
Yeah, but that's almost different.

360
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,640
I mean, you say that, but it's somewhat pointed in that like, I agree with your point, but

361
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,520
they could still all be using a legacy API.

362
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:45,520
I'm not saying that the judgment of legacy is correct, but them being up to date doesn't

363
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,520
matter at all to this discussion.

364
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,520
I think that's what it is.

365
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:52,220
Bear in mind that Linux users are a niche already and people who use the GNOME desktop

366
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,680
are a niche within that niche.

367
00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:01,920
So throw your weight around to say that everyone else who's outside of this bubble is a legacy

368
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:08,760
product is ludicrously arrogant in my mind because the fact remains, all these developers

369
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,720
have to go around changing all this stuff because a niche of a niche want them to, and

370
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,360
I think that's just pushing it a bit too far.

371
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,720
I couldn't say it better myself.

372
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,720
It's certainly bad politics.

373
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,560
As somebody who likes the GNOME desktop, I couldn't say it better myself, well put.

374
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:27,120
That's I think, okay, so that's our thoughts on it and I'm curious to see where it goes

375
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,500
and I will also, if it seems that application developers take note and they begin updating

376
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,640
their applications to support the new APIs, I will be the first person here reporting

377
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,640
it.

378
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,200
I'm going to keep you updated, but I completely agree with Poby's assessment and producer

379
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
Michael's assessment.

380
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,600
I want to take a moment.

381
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,880
I just got back from New York, but I can't stay still.

382
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:54,800
This Friday, October 6th and 7th, I'm going to be at Seagull with Mr. West.

383
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,800
That's right.

384
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,800
And Ang.

385
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,640
Ang is going to go too and Seagull is sort of a grassroots tech conference.

386
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,160
It's a GNU slash Linux conference that respects your privacy and we're going to do a meetup

387
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,160
there.

388
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,120
So just go to meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting for this Friday and we'll be there rocking

389
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,120
it out.

390
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,120
I'm giving a talk there, so it'll be fun for everyone.

391
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,120
Did I know that?

392
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,440
I mean, I did legitimately forget a few things about this, but did you tell me that and I

393
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,440
forgot?

394
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,440
I swear I did.

395
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,440
It was a while ago.

396
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,960
I think it was way back when it was first accepted, which was ages ago now.

397
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,960
Wow.

398
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,960
Yeah.

399
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,960
Okay.

400
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,960
That kind of rings a bell.

401
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,960
What are you giving a talk about?

402
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,600
I'm giving a talk about my dear friend Clojure, actually Clojure script and maybe why Linux

403
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,040
admins might find it a great way to write shell scripts.

404
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,040
So you maniac.

405
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,040
What day is that?

406
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,040
That's on Friday.

407
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,040
Okay.

408
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,040
That's the day I'm going to be there.

409
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,040
I'm going to be there on Friday.

410
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,040
Oh yeah.

411
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,040
Clojure.

412
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,040
Oh yeah.

413
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,040
Right here.

414
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,040
There you are.

415
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,040
Room 3179 by Mr. Westpain.

416
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,040
Look at you.

417
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,040
That's right.

418
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,040
Look at you.

419
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,040
So if you want to see me there and of course I'll be hanging out all day.

420
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,040
So yeah.

421
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,040
Love to see you JB people in attendance.

422
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,040
Yeah.

423
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,040
That would be awesome.

424
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,360
And we will be doing some interviews and we'll play.

425
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,980
Seagull is new-ish.

426
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,480
It's been going around for a few years.

427
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,160
Eric, didn't you go like three years ago or something like that to Seagull?

428
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,160
Oh gosh.

429
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,160
Yeah.

430
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,160
It had to be a good three years ago.

431
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,160
Yeah.

432
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,160
So we've been dabbling.

433
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,160
I should have been last.

434
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,160
Yeah.

435
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,720
And so ever since, you know, we started really when Eric was like, okay, we got to start

436
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,920
covering this.

437
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,240
But the timing is constantly in conflict with other events.

438
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,000
And so this year we're going to try to make an effort to go down there.

439
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,360
And it's October 6th if you want to go there when we're going to be there.

440
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:31,140
And Wes's talk, Mr. Wes's talk looks like it begins at 1045 Pacific time if you want

441
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,680
to catch that in room 3179.

442
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,680
How about that?

443
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,680
That's right.

444
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,760
I got the address in the show notes too.

445
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,760
And we got the meetup page, meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

446
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,160
If you want to get it, if you look at that, we already got a few people going.

447
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,160
Heck yes.

448
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,160
That's awesome.

449
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,160
Well, that'll be really cool.

450
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,200
So Seagull, I've never been, but I'm curious about it.

451
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,560
And what made you decide to give a talk?

452
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,560
We were hanging out with them.

453
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:55,000
They, some of the people who put it on at Linux Fest, and they're just talking it up

454
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,920
that they're trying to get a broader range.

455
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:01,360
So Linux is definitely there, but they wanted topics about general programming, DevOps,

456
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,360
cloud, automation.

457
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,840
I noticed your talk is not for Linux.

458
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,440
It's closure for Unix hackers.

459
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,440
Yeah.

460
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,440
Well, I mean, I wanted to be inclusive.

461
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,800
Wait, you think Node Run's on lots of platforms?

462
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,320
You think Alan Jude's going to this thing?

463
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,040
Well, you know, I mean, I wish.

464
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,800
I should have sent him an invitation, I suppose.

465
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,800
You know, that guy just got a MacBook.

466
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,800
I saw that on Twitter.

467
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,800
Is that right?

468
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,800
Yeah.

469
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,920
You should include, yeah, you do need to have a big umbrella because you've got to include

470
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,920
him.

471
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:28,840
So if you want to go, it's seagull.org, and you can find out more information on our show

472
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,840
notes and meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting to go to that.

473
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,800
I think just Friday for me, I think, is what we're going to do.

474
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,800
We'll probably go during midday.

475
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,800
That makes sense.

476
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,800
I think it starts at like 9 a.m.

477
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,800
Yeah, I think so.

478
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,400
There's a lot of events going on.

479
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,720
It's that season, I guess.

480
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,400
Yeah, and we've got to get to the Ubuntu Rally stuff.

481
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,960
I just have a couple of more community news items I just want to mention briefly.

482
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:59,840
There's one story that, actually, let's see if the Discord chat room can guess what story

483
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,640
I'm about to talk about next.

484
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:08,320
There is one story in open source news that never dies, and I'll give you a hint.

485
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,600
It is they're running Linux, and they're going to switch away from Linux, and then they're

486
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,160
going to run Linux again, and then they're going to switch away from Linux again.

487
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:22,400
If you can guess what story I'm about to talk about in the Discord room, you get, I don't

488
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,840
know, five internet points for the day.

489
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,160
But first, I'll mention Linux Academy, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

490
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,860
It's a platform to learn more about Linux and get critical thinking and troubleshooting

491
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:35,260
on Linux, too, which is, I think, incredibly valuable, and it's a great way to learn new

492
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,800
skills and advance your career.

493
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,920
It's really a platform for all of that.

494
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:43,320
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged is where you go to support the show.

495
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,520
You're smart enough to guess how that works.

496
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,880
They track the fact that you went to that website, so they know that it's worth spending

497
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,880
money here.

498
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,040
But also, you can sign up for a free seven-day trial.

499
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,040
Everybody wins!

500
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,040
It's funny how that works.

501
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,920
We don't have to track all of the things.

502
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,240
We don't have to have deep metrics about your usage.

503
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,080
You just go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, and this show stays on the air, and you get

504
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,880
a seven-day free trial for a platform that gives you self-paced, in-depth video courses

505
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,520
on every freaking Linux and cloud and gosh-darn DevOps topic out there.

506
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,760
I mean, hoo-wee, Wes, hoo-wee, Wes, hoo-wee.

507
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,400
Also, hands-on, scenario-based labs that give you real experiences on real servers.

508
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,040
You get to SSHN to a virtual server that they'll spin up on demand.

509
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,840
But what if I only know Ubuntu?

510
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,520
I really need to learn some Red Hat.

511
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,520
Do they have that?

512
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,520
Can they do that there?

513
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,520
You know what, Wes?

514
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,520
I got great news for you, Wes.

515
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,760
You just choose the distribution, and kapow, all of the courseware and them virtual machines

516
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,080
automatically switch over to match that choice.

517
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,080
Boom.

518
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,080
Boom, Wes.

519
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,080
They also have learning paths.

520
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,000
If you just want a series of courses and content that's been planned by their instructors for

521
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,840
like a specific track, they got that.

522
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,560
If you're going for certs, they got training for that.

523
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,260
They got practice exams.

524
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,360
They have all kinds of different planning and scheduling systems.

525
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:58,120
If you're busy, maybe you own your own business, you've got three kids and you travel often,

526
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,320
it can be hard.

527
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,240
And they've got systems that'll help you plan for that.

528
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,520
They got a community stacked full of Jupyter Broadcasting members.

529
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,760
They have iOS and Android apps so you can study on the go.

530
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:11,360
And they have offline lesson audio, notebooks, and tools to help you study, even without

531
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,360
the internet.

532
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,560
I know, without the internet.

533
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,440
Can you believe such a thing even exists, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged?

534
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,440
What a platform.

535
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,360
You're constantly getting new courseware.

536
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:24,480
They're retrofitting old courseware, instructor mentoring, actual human beings are available

537
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,480
whenever you need it.

538
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,480
You get value out of that membership, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

539
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:36,720
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring this year's Linux Unplugged program, linuxacademy.com

540
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,720
slash unplugged.

541
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,960
They're amazing.

542
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,520
So I've got a guess for you.

543
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,880
Patrick, Patrick, quit your quiz there?

544
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,880
Yeah.

545
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,880
I think the answer is the JB Studio.

546
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,880
Oh, did you come up with that on your own?

547
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,880
That's right to the core.

548
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,880
Right to the core.

549
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,880
Oh, you son of a...

550
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,880
No, wait, that's not it.

551
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,880
It's Linux in here.

552
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,880
What am I saying?

553
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,880
Yeah, although I got it.

554
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:00,120
It's funny you say that because this morning, Gnome 3 was working on the OBS machine except

555
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,080
for I can't move any windows, I can't resize any windows.

556
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,080
Why would you want to do that?

557
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,200
The applications menu won't come up and dash to doc was totally locked up.

558
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,320
Outside of that though, OBS is working great.

559
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,320
Perfect, beautiful.

560
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,840
Yeah, and so I was like, oh shit, why did I switch this to Linux?

561
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,320
No, it's Munich.

562
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:22,400
It is Munich and the open source pioneer, as Tech Republic calls it.

563
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,080
And something about this story, it just won't die.

564
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,400
I honestly feel like I've been covering this story for 10 years.

565
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,400
Yeah.

566
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,400
Pretty much.

567
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,400
I think I have been.

568
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,400
I think I literally have.

569
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,400
It has been ever since.

570
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,440
Yeah, I just really can't believe I'm still talking about this.

571
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,320
Honestly a little just befuddled by it, but if you look at the situation, it's kind of

572
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,780
obvious it was going to go this way.

573
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:46,400
Now that we know 10 years later everything we know.

574
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,160
And it's been back and forth, on and off, are they going to switch to Windows, are they

575
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,160
not?

576
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,160
And the final decision isn't actually even made yet.

577
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,880
It's not going to be until November this year.

578
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:02,960
But it does appear to be going not in Linux's favor because the council has already begun

579
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,960
work.

580
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,960
The council.

581
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,480
It sounds like this is something out of a sci-fi movie.

582
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:12,580
The council has already begun work to switch to freaking Microsoft Exchange.

583
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:18,220
And they say it with some rather, I don't know, maybe I'm reading too much into this,

584
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:22,740
but I feel like there's a little bit of spite in this quote that Tech Republic got.

585
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,800
And here's the quote.

586
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,840
The city will use Microsoft Exchange.

587
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,200
It will be used for mail and calendar.

588
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,720
So Colab will not be used anymore.

589
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,720
That's the entire quote.

590
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,720
Oh, ouch.

591
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,720
Yeah.

592
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,280
And so we'll find out what happens with the desktops.

593
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:45,520
But generally, when you're switching to Exchange and Outlook, it's slightly harder to use Linux.

594
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,520
Yeah, just a bit.

595
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:51,080
Although, you know, that if you can get by with Office 365, you got the web.

596
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,200
Now we don't really need to worry too much about this because first of all, they rolled

597
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,360
their old Linux distro.

598
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:02,320
And second of all, we all know that the Windows kingdom is at risk as Apple and Linux operating

599
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,920
systems post record gross.

600
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,680
This is an article from Softpedia News.

601
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,680
And it's-

602
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,440
Why am I, why am I, I got a little tingle going on here.

603
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,440
Something's-

604
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,440
Something's not quite right?

605
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,440
Yeah.

606
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,440
Yeah, well, here's the article.

607
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,880
And I've been seeing this float around all day today, so I thought we'd talk about it

608
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,880
here for a moment.

609
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,880
Windows is currently the leading choice for desktop operating systems, the article says.

610
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,760
Obviously, everybody knows that.

611
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,880
And the cited source says this.

612
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,920
That's literally what the article says.

613
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:33,120
With no less than 88.88%, 88.88% everybody of the computers across the world are running

614
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,920
that Windows operating system.

615
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:39,320
Now the Apple Mac, the runner up has 6.29%.

616
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:48,920
And Linux comes in at a third with 4.83%, only are damn near 5%, everybody.

617
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,680
I have no data to go off of.

618
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,880
But when I hear that the Mac is at 6%, that sounds like bullshit.

619
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,360
And when I hear that Linux is at 4%, that sounds like bullshit.

620
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,560
And I'm not sure which one is exaggerated.

621
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,040
But if you were to go by these numbers, Linux is way up.

622
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:10,400
It has jumped from 3.37, yes, 3.37%, from last month, or I guess, no, maybe May, I think

623
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,960
that's what it was, to 4.83%.

624
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,140
So the growth is impressive, to say the least.

625
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:21,040
And I think back in May, it was like 1.99%.

626
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:25,040
So are these net market share numbers, like the usual source?

627
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,960
Net market share for the month of September.

628
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,960
Okay.

629
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,700
Well, I'm not going to hold out any hopes here.

630
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:34,240
Let's let it sit for a few months, see if we stabilize or if it's just a weird fluke.

631
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,840
All of these are bullshit numbers.

632
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,440
They're all bullshit numbers.

633
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,880
But one of the things that's interesting is all the different bullshit number tracking

634
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,960
systems, with the exception of the Steam, which is a separate, the Steam Hardware Survey,

635
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,720
which is a whole separate thing, all of the other ones are actually showing a legitimate

636
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,080
increase in Linux usage.

637
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:58,440
So while I feel like in isolation, they're each bullshit, in totality, they are all reflecting

638
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,320
an increase in Linux desktop share.

639
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,960
We're going to do a meta-survey here, publish some results, try to weed out the bad ones.

640
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,000
Well, I mean, none of them are showing a decrease, so that's notable.

641
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Definitely.

642
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,440
In Linux Action News 18 or 19, I did a breakdown of how some of these market numbers are collected,

643
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,320
and it is really crap.

644
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,800
But the Steam Hardware Survey is a separate problem.

645
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:26,960
So that's the one area where Linux is continuing to decline month over month, decline in total

646
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,400
percentage of Steam users.

647
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,560
And that's the key right there.

648
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:36,840
Steam itself is growing at an incredible clip, and Linux users are not declining, but they're

649
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,720
just becoming a smaller minority.

650
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,120
So the Steam Hardware Survey being the exception to that.

651
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,240
And it's, yeah, it's just a different mix.

652
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,240
Come on, Eric.

653
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,240
Oh, yeah.

654
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:52,400
Did anybody ever see the NetMarketShare's preliminary report for this past September?

655
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,920
I don't think so.

656
00:28:53,920 --> 00:29:01,040
They were like publishing their preliminary report at like 6.97% Linux market share.

657
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,120
And I was just like, nope, there's no way.

658
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,320
That means it would have had to double in one month.

659
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:14,800
You know, this whole thing about measuring the totality of computer users seems like

660
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,720
a bad way to go to begin with.

661
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:24,440
Because you really, you know, if you measure all devices, that's a useless statistic.

662
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:29,600
You almost need to measure like influences or active users, or I don't know.

663
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,240
There's like another metric out there where I think Linux has a much higher percentage

664
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,240
usage.

665
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,560
I mean, there's hundreds of thousands of people that listen to Jupiter broadcasting shows.

666
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,440
So there's got to be an audience out there.

667
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,120
I mean, it's not like it's just 10 people downloading over and over again.

668
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,640
Think of all the people NOAA's switching every day.

669
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,640
Yeah, exactly.

670
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,040
The same thing is also a thing where I've only been asked to do the hardware survey

671
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,040
once ever.

672
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,040
Once ever.

673
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,040
Same.

674
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,040
Once ever.

675
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,040
Totally.

676
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,600
And you know what's funny is we have one Windows system that I'll boot up every now and then

677
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,560
in here, and that thing's gotten it a couple times.

678
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,560
Yeah, right.

679
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,560
Mine too.

680
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,960
It's like I have two Linux machines, one Windows.

681
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,480
Somehow the Windows always gets in the survey and it's like, okay, well, this is not representative.

682
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,480
Well, I should say, before we go any further, I should say thank you to you in particular,

683
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,080
End of the Beard, for filling in last week.

684
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,720
Hey, it was a lot of fun.

685
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:24,900
I caught some of the episode as data allowed, but I was impressed at how many Wi-Fi access

686
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,680
points are open out there on the road.

687
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,680
Is that right?

688
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,760
And disappointed at how fricking many of them have CAPTCHAs.

689
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,760
Just so annoying.

690
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,320
And then like the CAPTCHAs where you have to reconnect after an hour or stuff.

691
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,640
So I tried to listen to a bit of it, and I caught some of it live.

692
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,640
So thank you for filling in.

693
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,640
Oh, my pleasure.

694
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,920
But on top of that, you and Mike banged out like a whole plethora of CoderRadio.

695
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,920
I think Coder's done now.

696
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,920
Is that how it works?

697
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,920
I think so.

698
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,920
I legitimately came in today.

699
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,160
I'm like, well, I think I'm probably going to have to record a CoderRadio today.

700
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,920
And Beard's like, no, I wasted like three of them on Friday.

701
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,920
Excellent.

702
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,400
I was like, holy crap.

703
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,400
Okay.

704
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,400
Well, all right.

705
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,960
Hopefully that makes things a bit easier for you getting back here and focused on Unplugged.

706
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,400
So thank you very much for that.

707
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,440
So if time allows, I'll have to buy you lunch on Friday when we go to Segal.

708
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,400
I think that's only fair, so you should make it a nice one.

709
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,400
Yeah.

710
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:15,000
Remember that place we went when we went to the Open Daylight Summit?

711
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,480
Yeah, there is one of those in downtown, too.

712
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,480
That was good.

713
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,480
Yes, it was.

714
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,480
I think I'm going to bring the vlog camera with me, too.

715
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,480
Of course.

716
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,480
Vlog a little secret.

717
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,480
It's all content, baby.

718
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,480
Yeah, that's right.

719
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,480
That's right.

720
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,480
Okay.

721
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,200
But before we keep going about the new trip, I should probably talk about the last trip.

722
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,200
Yeah, I guess so.

723
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,360
Going to New York, New York City, and hanging out at the Ubuntu Rally.

724
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:39,840
I had always been curious, because often after a big canonical event, Popeye and Wimpy will

725
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:46,400
join us, and I'll ask them probing questions about it, but I didn't have the context.

726
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,520
We only got that tiny slice of what it was like, what was really happening.

727
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,520
Right.

728
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:55,600
And plus, they could leave out something, or they could be excluding something, like

729
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,800
90% of the people are screwing off, and 10% of the people there are actually the people

730
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,800
getting work done.

731
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,240
The only reason I say that is because I have been to company work events like that, and

732
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,240
that's what it's like.

733
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,080
You talk to one person, it's a totally different experience.

734
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,680
Yeah, and I'm always the guy doing the work, too.

735
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:15,600
I was really, really genuinely curious how Canonical gets something like this done.

736
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,000
This is the first time they'd ever called it an Ubuntu Rally.

737
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,640
You've had different conferences.

738
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,680
It's like a conference for Canonical employees and certain community members that get brought

739
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:29,240
in.

740
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:34,060
It's particularly unique to them because they, more so than a lot of companies, have a lot

741
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:37,960
of people working from home, a lot are remote working.

742
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:44,280
They get brought together very rarely, and that gives it a unique energy and twist.

743
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,400
That's another reason that really piqued my interest, and why I was willing to drive in

744
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,520
a tiny, compact car from Seattle to New York.

745
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,520
Yeah, wow.

746
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,520
That is impressive.

747
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,760
I don't think I'll ever do it again.

748
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:59,880
I'm glad I did it once, I think, but I don't think I'll ever do it again.

749
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:08,240
I definitely want to talk about the Ubuntu Rally, and if you want to see sort of my best

750
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:14,840
attempt at combining three days into one video and giving you a sense of what it would like

751
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:20,560
to be attend, to be an attendee at the Ubuntu Rally, I have posted on my vlog, I have posted

752
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:26,800
vlog 58 inside the Ubuntu Rally, and it's nine minutes and 55 seconds long, and it encapsulates

753
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:31,680
three days at the Ubuntu Rally, and it sort of gives you a sense of what it's like to

754
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:36,960
be there, at least for one day, and I would encourage you to watch it, because a lot of

755
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,440
effort went into making that, and if you find it enjoyable, I would ask that you would maybe

756
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,720
share it with somebody, or retweet it, or something like that if you enjoyed it, and

757
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,840
if you didn't, let me know what you didn't like about it, and I'll try to make it better

758
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:50,000
in the future, and I have that embedded in the show notes if you want to check that out,

759
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
but I did...

760
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
It seems like an interesting...

761
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Just, sorry.

762
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
No, no, go ahead.

763
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,520
There's a huge advantage in that it's very much, like, obviously there's pluses and minuses,

764
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,120
you know, Canonical is the company, but I feel like there's a lot of people, maybe not

765
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,200
even Linux people, that might identify with that sort of thing.

766
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,440
They're used to seeing Microsoft and Apple events, they're used to understanding the

767
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,400
culture in that kind of way, and so maybe if they don't, they're not driven to Ubuntu

768
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,920
in terms of, oh, here's this weird open source community thing, maybe seeing this, seeing

769
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,320
the amount of work, seeing the culture, seeing the people who are doing it, it seems like

770
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,800
a unique way to connect with the company.

771
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:26,160
It gave me a great perspective on not only how a worldwide company does something like

772
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:32,720
this, and holy, humbling, as a small business owner, a humbling sense of the amount of investment

773
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,800
that Mark and Canonical put into something like that.

774
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:43,280
My room, my bedroom alone, my one room that I paid for out of my own pocket was $470 a

775
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:51,320
night, and Canonical employees got a discount, but not much, and the employees didn't pay

776
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,720
it, Canonical did.

777
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,780
So they got a group rate, but it was a group rate that wasn't very significant because

778
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,400
I know what the group rate was.

779
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:02,120
And so just the outlay on the rooms, because they had dozens of conference rooms, they

780
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:09,640
had an entire plaza area, they had a huge keynote room, the flights of all of the community

781
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:16,680
members and the Canonical members that went out there plus their rooms was a substantial

782
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:21,680
investment easily, easily in the millions.

783
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,000
Because just the equipment, Noah and I went through the equipment they use in the keynote

784
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,880
room, and we are familiar with how much it costs to ship equipment, just equipment alone,

785
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,560
$25,000 in shipment and equipment.

786
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,360
So just an incredible outlay.

787
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,360
They're doing it right.

788
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,120
And you think about it though, they don't have an office space, right?

789
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,360
They don't have a huge building in downtown London, right?

790
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,880
So this is, they bring everybody together a couple of times a year.

791
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:48,720
And so it's not an unbelievable outlay, but holy smokes, it is a hell of an outlay.

792
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,760
It is really something.

793
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,760
So I want to talk about that.

794
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:55,120
I got a couple of clips I want to play, an interview with Daniel Foray I want to talk

795
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,880
about which I thought turned out really great.

796
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,760
So first I'm going to mention DigitalOcean.

797
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:04,600
Go to digitalocean.com, create an account, and use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED, DOUNPLUGGED,

798
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,920
all one word, you apply it to your account after you've created the account, and then

799
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,840
you get the $10 credit.

800
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:14,760
It's a really simple infrastructure that you can spin up and control on demand with an

801
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:20,480
entire stack of Linux and Docker and an application ready to go, or just a bare Linux installation

802
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,880
or even free BSD.

803
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,000
They've got lots of distributions you can choose from.

804
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Everything's SSD.

805
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,860
And the base rate starts at just $5 a month that you can get deployed within seconds.

806
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:35,520
Now I had a chance since I got back to play with their new object storage.

807
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,680
This is way different than what I was expecting.

808
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,680
Is that right?

809
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,680
What were you expecting?

810
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,400
I was expecting essentially a straight up S3 competitor.

811
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,400
And it is.

812
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,400
It is.

813
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,800
But it's an S3 competitor that human beings can use.

814
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:54,840
It's so great because if you want, you can programmatically define storage, destroy storage,

815
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,840
use storage.

816
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,640
You can take advantage of their API.

817
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,280
It's full on object storage.

818
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,440
But if you just want to use it as a place to upload files and give someone a public

819
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,160
URL, and they get a crazy fast download that has a time expiring link, you can just use

820
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,160
it as that.

821
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,160
It's so easy.

822
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,160
It's nuts, man.

823
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,160
So you go into the dashboard.

824
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,640
You create your object storage, your space.

825
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,920
And then you upload a file.

826
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,500
And immediately everything by default is private.

827
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,480
And then you can choose which goes public.

828
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,540
And then everything gets a URL, which you can use programmatically.

829
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:28,240
Or you can just go into the dashboard and say, generate me a URL.

830
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,480
And you can just share a URL.

831
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,200
And so I was sending files to Noah today.

832
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,520
And I'm like, this is going to be destroyed in seven days.

833
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,520
Here you go.

834
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,520
Here's the URL.

835
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:42,240
And I was saturating our 100 megabit connection here at the studio when I was pulling it.

836
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,240
Saturating it.

837
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,240
So spaces.

838
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,320
And you just turn it on.

839
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,400
They have a trial right now.

840
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,880
The pricing is ridiculously great.

841
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,920
You can try it two months for absolutely free.

842
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,280
It's scalable storage.

843
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,640
It's available as a standalone service outside of DigitalOcean.

844
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,240
You don't have to have a Droplet spun up to take advantage of it.

845
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,360
And you can get started in just an instant.

846
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,080
And the API is S3 compatible.

847
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,160
So if you have tools that work with S3, ship it up to JDO.

848
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:07,880
I think you'll find their network, their transit costs, much more reasonable.

849
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,880
It's so fast.

850
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:14,720
And I was thinking, too, in regards to the API, I could really see Jbot taking advantage

851
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,720
of something like this.

852
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:20,240
Because we could give Jbot the ability to programmatically create a storage space it

853
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:24,000
needs, dump files in there, like cache files, avatar files.

854
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,920
If people in the chat room want to be able to transfer files between IRC and Discord,

855
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,920
it could generate the temporary storage, store the file there, transfer the file, destroy

856
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,920
the storage.

857
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,160
Like, a bot could do all of this stuff.

858
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,160
It'll just get taken care of.

859
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,040
And it's just so easy to use.

860
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,200
Or if you just want to drag files from your desktop into your web browser and generate

861
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,200
a URL, you can do that.

862
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,200
That just works.

863
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,200
It just works.

864
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,080
Yeah, like you said, a real human could use it.

865
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:50,280
I mean, I never thought it would be this cool.

866
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,280
So you could check it out.

867
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,000
Go to DigitalOcean.com, create the account, and then use our promo code D1Plugged.

868
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,640
And they also have a two-month trial right now.

869
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,760
You can just try it for free, the new object storage spaces.

870
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,760
It's so cool.

871
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,880
There's a lot of great features over at DigitalOcean, but object storage might be my new favorite.

872
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,000
DigitalOcean.com, create the promo code D1Plugged.

873
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,520
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring this show and for creating spaces.

874
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,840
I am going to use the S out of spaces.

875
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,840
Very excited about that.

876
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,400
Just use our promo code D1Plugged to get that $10 credit.

877
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,400
All right.

878
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,880
So let's talk about the Ubuntu rally.

879
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,240
I got there Sunday night.

880
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,000
And it was a long haul.

881
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,040
It was like six or seven days of driving.

882
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,040
And I got there.

883
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,440
And I mean, I couldn't have nailed the timing any better.

884
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,000
We got there, and they were all going out to dinner.

885
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
And I was like, oh, I want to go.

886
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I want to go.

887
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
So it was perfect.

888
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,120
And I thought I'd talk a little bit about what it was like to go as an attendee for

889
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:55,100
a moment, because there was a feel to the room.

890
00:39:55,100 --> 00:40:00,120
And that feel was there is a responsibility to get work done.

891
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:06,320
Like the people there understood the outlay that Canonical had spent to make it all happen.

892
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:10,000
And so everybody felt a sense of, we've got to get work done.

893
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,440
And I thought Mark did a good job of reminding everybody, we are here to work.

894
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,120
So you carry a lot of responsibilities.

895
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,120
And so for that reason, I want to ask you not to take the expression that this is a

896
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:24,760
city that never sleeps as a personal challenge.

897
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,760
This is an incredible environment.

898
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,760
I'm delighted to have us here.

899
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:32,280
You know, I like going to kind of out of the way places where there's at least one extra

900
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:38,200
leg just to torture everybody, but mainly actually so that we can be in special places

901
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:44,600
that you may never otherwise get to, but you might read about them on travel or some interesting

902
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,600
blog.

903
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,800
I thought that was an interesting point he makes.

904
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:52,240
So one of the, essentially what Mark is saying here is, first of all, don't party too much

905
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,260
because we're all here to get some work done.

906
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:57,680
And second of all, he's saying one of the perks of being a canonical employee is every

907
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,320
now and then you get to go to these places that you really only kind of read about.

908
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,320
And isn't that true?

909
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,080
Like I've never been to New York and I'm not even a canonical employee.

910
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,600
Like I went to New York because of this canonical event.

911
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:11,360
Like when they create a gravitational pull around something, people come to an area they've

912
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,720
never been to before.

913
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,080
And that is kind of a unique perk to a company.

914
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:20,080
And then he kind of goes to set a little more of the tone of why folks are here.

915
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:25,440
I like to go to those places, we get to go to those places as part of our work and it

916
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,600
makes for sort of a special dimension to life at canonical and in Ubuntu.

917
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,160
But occasionally there is reason for us to come somewhere where pretty much everybody

918
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,080
has direct flights and this is one such occasion.

919
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:43,760
So basically make the most of it, but please don't be that person that lets your team

920
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,120
down because you just went wild.

921
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,040
Go wild and get some sleep.

922
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,280
And so the tone was sort of set.

923
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,000
Like we chose New York for a very specific reason.

924
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,520
Everybody can have a direct flight and we're all here to get some work done.

925
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:02,240
And the focus was specifically set when Mark started to drop some numbers about the usage

926
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,240
of the Ubuntu LTS releases.

927
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,000
The data are pretty simple.

928
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:15,600
An LTS gets about 10x the utilization of a non-LTS and sorry, of all the non-LTSs and

929
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:20,620
about therefore about 20x the average non-LTS release.

930
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:26,660
So to make that clear, an LTS release gets 20x the amount of users, 20x the amount of

931
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,920
users as a non-LTS release.

932
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,960
So it really counts.

933
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,080
Use that information, use that data to shape your choices this week about what you're going

934
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,600
to try and get done.

935
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,640
So that's Mark setting the focus.

936
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,240
This is our priority.

937
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:45,560
Make sure it impacts the LTS release because this is the release that matters most to Ubuntu

938
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,560
users.

939
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,920
And with that, it was essentially it.

940
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,200
Mark set the tone and everybody got to work.

941
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,200
That's awesome.

942
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,280
So I wanted to get a sense, and we're going to talk to both Wimpy and Pope here, we're

943
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:00,040
going to talk to them in just a moment, but I wanted to get a sense from a fellow outsider.

944
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,120
What was your impression of this?

945
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:06,160
Because I could ask the people that work for the company, but there's going to be a certain

946
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,160
familiarity.

947
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,640
So I wanted to ask somebody who came from the outside, small business owner who was

948
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14,320
there at this event that could share a perspective with me.

949
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:19,400
And so I sat down with the founder of Elementary L. So you guys may be familiar with.

950
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,040
My name is Daniel Fore and I'm from Sacramento, California.

951
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,680
You guys know Daniel Fore and so Daniel sat down with me and I asked him what it felt

952
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,880
like to be an outsider at this Ubuntu event.

953
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:31,840
Well, I definitely feel actually super at home at these events.

954
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:35,320
I don't know if a lot of people know, but I used to do contracting work for Canonical

955
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,800
on their design team.

956
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,740
So I used to attend UDS and all that.

957
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:42,080
So it's nice to see a lot of familiar faces.

958
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,160
I have a lot of friends that are still working at Canonical.

959
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:50,880
So yeah, I really enjoy being here and getting to see those people again and it's definitely

960
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,520
nice to reconnect with them.

961
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:57,040
And I feel like that the people that I hadn't met before are really easy to get along with.

962
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,600
Everybody's really welcoming.

963
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:06,200
It seems like there's a culture of outreach within Canonical where people want to make

964
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:10,480
I guess the wider open source community members feel like they're welcome and important and

965
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,980
their feedback matters.

966
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:15,400
I thought that was an interesting point because I think a culture of outreach might be something

967
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,720
that I'd also say I felt was present there.

968
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:23,280
And it was obvious why I wanted to go from a Linux journalism standpoint.

969
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,680
It was obvious why I wanted to be there.

970
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:28,120
But what was really the value for elementary and for Daniel for being there?

971
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:34,720
Even if we come back and don't ever ship snaps, just being here, we've been able to get different

972
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:39,280
issues that we have in front of people and have them be able to go, oh yeah, okay, you

973
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,840
know, I saw that in the bug tracker but I didn't get around to it.

974
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:46,480
Or oh, you know, you need to talk to this person about that or I think just being able

975
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,000
to network is really valuable.

976
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,240
I know that we've already had a couple of instances where we identified a couple issues

977
00:44:53,240 --> 00:45:00,000
in Snap that were rapidly either addressed or confirmed in the issue tracker.

978
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,640
So I think the FaceTime really helps.

979
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:07,860
And like I said, I think the wider effect even outside of snaps is being able to communicate

980
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:12,600
with people that are involved in different parts of the desktop team maybe because Ubuntu

981
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,900
is our upstream.

982
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:15,020
Very true.

983
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:16,800
And I thought that was a great point.

984
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,680
So I thought, okay, Daniel, well, let's ask you something that's maybe a little uncomfortable

985
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,880
because you've been fairly positive so far.

986
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:30,160
How has the switch from Unity 7 to GNOME and all of the changes in Ubuntu 17.10 screwed

987
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,520
things up for elementary OS?

988
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,980
How has it really messed things up?

989
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:39,440
In a lot of ways, actually, the change is positive for us because there's less overlap

990
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:45,000
between what happens in our desktop environment and what happens in Ubuntu.

991
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:51,600
I know that we've had issues in the past where Ubuntu is carrying a patched version of GDK

992
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:56,720
or only had certain libraries that only worked in Ubuntu.

993
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:03,640
And so our kind of wider fan base, I guess, on other distributions who are trying to leverage

994
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:07,400
our source code there were having problems because it was very Ubuntu specific.

995
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:12,200
And we're also a little more disconnected from upstream libraries like GLib and GNOME

996
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,400
and things like that.

997
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:18,860
So I think with Ubuntu's move to a more vanilla kind of GNOME experience and also trying to

998
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:24,500
pull in newer versions of the packages that it's helped us out a lot not having to worry

999
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:29,000
so much about breaking changes from patches and backports and things like that.

1000
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,480
And he wasn't the only person I heard that from.

1001
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:35,160
That was actually kind of a common sentiment that I heard is that actually these changes

1002
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,240
have all been pretty much for the positive.

1003
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,080
Neil was there from the Fedora project.

1004
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,760
He said kind of the same thing, essentially.

1005
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:45,560
He had more perspectives and different issues that he wanted to address.

1006
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:50,920
And I thought overall, everybody was sort of there in part of the conversation.

1007
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:53,680
Everybody was at least part of the conversation.

1008
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:59,400
And I would say, so picture it's a hotel room and you have a couple of different floors

1009
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,400
of this hotel room.

1010
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:06,640
You have conference room floor and floor 14, which are really decked out for having meetings.

1011
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,480
And Canonical has co-opted all of these meeting spaces.

1012
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:14,960
And you just have like a laser printer or dot matrix or not dot matrix, but a printout

1013
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:15,960
on the door.

1014
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,400
It's like, this is the kernel room.

1015
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,280
This is the software as a service room.

1016
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,700
This is the SNAP room, right?

1017
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:22,700
And you have these.

1018
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:26,400
And this is you go in there and if you have a question for that team, like Noah and I,

1019
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:31,840
there was a great interview that aired yesterday on Ask Noah with one of the Canonical employees

1020
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,680
who's working on Wayland and Mir.

1021
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:38,320
And so we just had questions about like, wow, what are you guys struggling with?

1022
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:41,200
And so we just walk into that room and just start asking them questions.

1023
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,600
And that just aired yesterday and Ask Noah if you want to check that out.

1024
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,720
And so it's the second half of the show.

1025
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:46,720
Really great interview.

1026
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:52,080
Also, they talk in there about what they might do if Wayland totally bombs in 1710 and what

1027
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,800
their backup plans might be.

1028
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,220
That's in the Ask Noah interview.

1029
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:58,820
But the room that I think I found to be the most fun to hang out in, the most interesting

1030
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:01,280
to hang out in, would be the SNAP room.

1031
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,280
So here's a little bit from that.

1032
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:06,800
So Noah and I are crashing the SNAP craft room right now because there's a good mix

1033
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,080
of different companies and projects all in one space.

1034
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:13,760
So this is sort of a microcosm of the entire event.

1035
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,520
So it's one of our favorite rooms to hang out in.

1036
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,960
And of course, our buddy Wimpy's over there, too.

1037
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:22,680
And I wouldn't say it was the biggest room of the event, but there did seem to be a lot

1038
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:26,920
of buzz and a lot of different eclectic companies in there, eh, Wimpy?

1039
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,680
Yeah, it was quite the collection.

1040
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:37,160
Yeah, that was where most of the people that were invited from the community or from ISVs

1041
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,400
were doing their work.

1042
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,060
And I saw your Google Plus post.

1043
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:47,040
You mentioned there was different some of those different vendors where I think Microsoft

1044
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,600
was on the list.

1045
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,600
Yeah.

1046
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:57,800
So we had three representatives, well, four representatives from three Microsoft teams.

1047
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:05,560
So we had two guys from the.NET team there, one guy from the Visual Studio Code team,

1048
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:09,440
and one guy from the Skype for Linux team.

1049
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,440
What do you think?

1050
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:21,400
Wow, I'm now just sort of taking in totality your sort of trajectory here with Canonical.

1051
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:26,640
And you just found yourself smack dab in the middle of probably one of the more important

1052
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:31,600
rooms at a very important Canonical event with very important companies and projects,

1053
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,680
and they're trying to produce packages around very important applications.

1054
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,480
How do you feel about all that?

1055
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:42,200
Well, see, you were experiencing that for the first time.

1056
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:49,160
What we're doing day to day is talking to the likes of those guys and community projects

1057
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:56,040
as well and assisting them from afar and giving them some technical advice and representing

1058
00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:02,960
their requirements in terms of development resources and capabilities and things like

1059
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,040
that.

1060
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:09,560
But doing that from afar when they're not tasked necessarily to work on particular things

1061
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:17,400
with a high degree of priority, having all of those people in a room for a week and also

1062
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:22,400
putting the right people from Canonical around them really accelerated a lot of what we were

1063
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,360
all trying to achieve and work on.

1064
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:28,760
So it was a very energetic room to be in, and I thoroughly enjoyed the week.

1065
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,440
It was absolutely fabulous.

1066
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:32,520
How are you feeling?

1067
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:41,920
I'm just about getting over the jet lag, I somehow messed up my sleeping when I got back.

1068
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,520
But yeah, I'm just about over that now.

1069
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:47,480
But yes, it was a brilliant week.

1070
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:51,760
We obviously had some exciting companies there working alongside us.

1071
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,180
And also we've heard from Daniel.

1072
00:50:54,180 --> 00:51:01,160
We also had Alish and Scarlett from Blue Systems and KDE.

1073
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,040
They were doing some fantastic work there.

1074
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:08,240
They've really expanded the portfolio of their applications that have snapped up.

1075
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,040
Yeah, and it was great to actually meet someone from Blue Systems.

1076
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,280
That was great.

1077
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,400
Quite the rare opportunity.

1078
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:22,860
And then of course, Daniel and Aiki from my point of view had some great over a beer conversations

1079
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:29,760
with them and also with Cody and the KDE guys in the evening because I've got a passion

1080
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:35,840
project which is a desktop distro and talking to other people working on Linux desktop projects

1081
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,840
and getting their take on things and insight on things.

1082
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:44,840
It's the kind of conversations you can't have effectively over Slack and IRC.

1083
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:51,520
So as Daniel said, that kind of face time, even if it's not necessarily working on stuff,

1084
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:55,960
but just in the evening, talking about all sorts of things like crowdfunding and stuff

1085
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:59,160
like that was really fascinating as well.

1086
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:05,120
I had a definite moment where there was a few celebrities as far as I'm concerned, Did

1087
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:08,600
Rocks and others that are creating code that really impact my daily life.

1088
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:14,280
It's like, oh, it's so cool to meet that person and put a real voice and a face to the name.

1089
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:18,320
I thought that right there and the stuff was very, very invaluable.

1090
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:22,400
I also noticed, and I was wondering, Poppy, if this was sort of maybe as a result of some

1091
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:27,160
of the collaboration and work at the Ubuntu Rally that the new community site is launched

1092
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,160
today.

1093
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:34,680
Yeah, thanks for mentioning that community.ubuntu.com.

1094
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:42,120
It kind of has been worked on for a few weeks now, but we got it solidified last week.

1095
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:49,760
We were going to launch a kind of prototype version of the site, but we had a nice conversation

1096
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:58,920
with our Canonical IS people and they decided to spin up a well-managed and robust version

1097
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:05,060
of the course for our community site, which replaces a static old crusty site that nobody

1098
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:06,920
ever maintained.

1099
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:11,840
So hopefully that will see a lot more active use.

1100
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,460
Yeah, it looks really nice.

1101
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:18,000
And I see a lot of well-known names from Canonical participating in the community over there

1102
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
too.

1103
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Yeah.

1104
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Yeah.

1105
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,480
What was your takeaway from the Ubuntu Rally as compared to previous events and sort of

1106
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,400
your historical perspective with Canonical?

1107
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,400
What did you think of it?

1108
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:34,280
It's funny, you mentioned that and you played the chat with Daniel from elementary.

1109
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:39,000
When he mentioned the fact that he'd been to previous Ubuntu Developer Summits or UDSs

1110
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:44,040
as we call them, I just looked up and the first UDS I went to was in 2007.

1111
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,040
Wow.

1112
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:50,920
So over 10 years ago was my first UDS and I paid my own way to go to my first UDS as

1113
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:54,080
a community guy in Seville in Spain.

1114
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:59,120
And Mark's right, like with Canonical, you get to visit a lot of interesting places.

1115
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:04,080
There's no way I would have chosen to go to Seville or I might not necessarily have gone

1116
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:10,160
to Prague and possibly wouldn't have been able to afford to fly to San Francisco multiple

1117
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,160
times.

1118
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:16,920
So I'm very grateful for the opportunity to go to these interesting places and last week

1119
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:22,840
I went up the Empire State Building and had a bit of time away from the office to see

1120
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:30,080
the sights of New York and the Irish bars of New York with Martin and Heike.

1121
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,080
I heard those stories.

1122
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:39,620
But it did really remind me of some of the UDSs of the past.

1123
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:44,680
But one of the problems with the UDSs of the past is they just got too big.

1124
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:49,800
Towards the end there were 700 people there and you've alluded to how expensive it probably

1125
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:50,800
was.

1126
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:54,400
I have no idea of the cost but how expensive it was to run that event in the center of

1127
00:54:54,400 --> 00:55:00,760
New York City and you imagine running that every six months with 500 plus people going.

1128
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:06,360
That's a tremendous amount of money to inject into events on a regular basis.

1129
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:09,680
Isn't it still going right now?

1130
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:14,280
I just saw a tweet from Dustin earlier today at the One World Trade Center.

1131
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,600
He's still in New York.

1132
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:22,080
So we often piggyback multiple events back to back because some of the senior management

1133
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,120
need to be to multiple events.

1134
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:29,280
So last week the event you were at was the Ubuntu rally and yeah we've never called it

1135
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:33,040
a rally before and it's a bit of a strange name for it.

1136
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,160
It's what we internally call a sprint.

1137
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:40,900
We all get together and we all, like you say, we all hack from 8.30 in the morning through

1138
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:45,640
till whatever time in the evening and often later.

1139
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:49,640
But then the following week, which is this week, there's a sales sprint and then the

1140
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,800
week after there's a product sprint.

1141
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:56,840
So we often have these back to back but you can think of the tremendous cost that that

1142
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:02,000
incurs for the company to host these events with so many people.

1143
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:14,680
It was 200 plus people at the event last week in a, not a crap hotel by any stretch of imagination.

1144
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:18,200
Given the price of the beer in the bar, it wasn't a terrible hotel.

1145
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:24,360
But yeah, when Daniel mentioned the memories of UDS gone by, it did rekindle that, especially

1146
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:29,960
given that on this occasion we were able to invite some community people along and rebuild

1147
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:37,560
some of those relationships which might not have been as well tended over the previous

1148
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,560
years.

1149
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:39,560
We're trying to rebuild some of those relationships.

1150
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:40,560
So that went well.

1151
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,560
Yeah.

1152
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:42,560
It did seem like a reset there a bit.

1153
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:43,560
There was a bit of a reset in a sense.

1154
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,520
And that's part of why we've started to rebuild the community website.

1155
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:51,280
So if you go to community.ubuntu.com, it's part of our mission at the moment and part

1156
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:57,760
of my mission as my role is to improve the onboarding process for new people who want

1157
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:58,960
to contribute to Ubuntu.

1158
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:02,680
So people who've, you know, bought their Dell laptop and it's got Ubuntu pre-installed

1159
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:06,440
and they think, you know, how can I help make this better or I want to be a good open source

1160
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:10,200
citizen and I want to file bugs in the right place or I want to, you know, make sure I

1161
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:13,600
contribute back to this thing that I got for free.

1162
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:18,200
I want to contribute back and we want to make the on-ramp easier for those people.

1163
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:22,580
But the second thing is we really want to make the communication from the teams at Canonical

1164
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:24,560
out to the community a lot better.

1165
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:29,360
So it's easier for people to talk to the people who can affect change, as Daniel said, being

1166
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:35,000
in the room with certain people in Canonical who he could put issues in front of them and

1167
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:41,040
say, hey, you know, we've been having a problem with this issue and that's, you know, slipped

1168
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,560
someone's mind or it's gone to the back of their queue or their to-do list.

1169
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:50,280
It's nice to be able to like poke the right people and get stuff done and get stuff working.

1170
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:54,120
And so that's part of why the new community hub exists.

1171
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:57,480
It's not there as a, I mean, we're using discourse.

1172
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:03,280
So you might be forgiven for thinking it's a forum, but we're trying to use it as more

1173
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:07,760
of a hub, more of a central place where people can go to find out information about what's

1174
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,160
going on in Ubuntu development and get involved in Ubuntu development.

1175
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:15,800
That seems really handy, especially like that can be a very hard thing to get right for

1176
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:16,800
a project.

1177
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:17,960
And, you know, it's easy to get turned off.

1178
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:20,240
Like if I can't find what I need, I'll go somewhere else.

1179
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,240
So if you can get it right from the first interaction, that's awesome.

1180
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:26,760
I was also surprised by just the type of conversations that were being had out in the public.

1181
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:29,600
That was my first impression when I saw it, I was like, oh, so they're just going to talk

1182
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,600
about that.

1183
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:31,600
Okay.

1184
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:32,600
Well, we're going to have to kill you now.

1185
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:36,080
I was like, well, I'm going to go ahead and read that thread.

1186
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,080
It's very interesting.

1187
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,080
Yeah.

1188
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,080
And I like it a lot.

1189
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,760
So I think it looks clean too.

1190
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:41,760
Yeah.

1191
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:47,160
It was, so it's interesting how little things like this sort of get extra momentum from

1192
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,160
the rally.

1193
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:52,080
I talked a little bit with Aiki about some of the work he's doing with snap integration

1194
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:53,080
for the Solus software center.

1195
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:56,760
I talked obviously with Daniel about it too and others.

1196
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:00,280
And I think everybody got a little bit of extra momentum on everything they're working

1197
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,280
on.

1198
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,280
Even non snap related things.

1199
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,280
Yeah, you mentioned Aiki there.

1200
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,280
Yeah.

1201
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:06,880
What you didn't see is Aiki gave one of the lightning talks on Friday.

1202
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:07,880
I had to miss that.

1203
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:08,880
Ooh.

1204
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:09,880
That was great.

1205
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:10,880
Yeah.

1206
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,160
It was a great, it was a great lightning talk and halfway through he got a round of applause

1207
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:19,840
from everyone at Canonical when he, you summarize, summarize the work that he's, he's done in

1208
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:20,840
Solus.

1209
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:21,840
Oh really?

1210
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:22,840
Yeah.

1211
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:23,840
That was really nice to see.

1212
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:24,840
Oh, I wish I could have stayed that long.

1213
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:27,880
I had to cut out by Wednesday, but you know, it was just the way it was, but I think that's

1214
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:29,880
one of the things that was really nice.

1215
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:35,240
Those lightning talks, there was, you know, Canonical people there, there were community

1216
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:36,240
people there.

1217
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:42,900
Nathan gave a great talk at the end about how he hopes app developers can improve things

1218
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:47,320
and how Canonical can improve things in Ubuntu and he's identified a bunch of, you know,

1219
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,760
places where we need to improve things.

1220
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:55,400
But there were other people who were invited to come along and, and participate in the

1221
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:56,400
SnapCraft room.

1222
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:05,440
For example, Mohammed Zedek works for a company that make robot ships that are quite cool

1223
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:14,080
that go around in the sea and do stuff under the command of like computers.

1224
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:17,560
But it was really great having him in the room, in the SnapCraft room, working along

1225
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:22,160
with Kyle and Leo and Sergio from the SnapCraft team.

1226
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,160
And he was bringing real world problems.

1227
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:29,960
Like it's not, it's not hypothetical issues that are on a computer somewhere in a lab.

1228
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:35,880
This is a guy who has boats who are out in the sea and they need to be autonomously controlled

1229
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:39,740
and they need to be updated securely and robustly.

1230
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:43,780
And he's talking directly to the people who are able to affect, you know, packaging his

1231
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:45,440
software efficiently.

1232
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,440
And he gave a talk as well.

1233
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:47,440
And that was great fun.

1234
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,440
That's great.

1235
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:51,160
You know, one of the things that, and this is a small example, but it happened a few

1236
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:54,680
times was a problem was identified.

1237
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:59,660
The issue was sort of quantified and then Upstream was given a suggestion and the patch

1238
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:02,120
was actually created on site.

1239
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:04,960
And Popa, you could probably talk a little bit about the, one of them, which was like

1240
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:09,160
a little doc issue when you're trying to switch desktops, kind of a small problem in totality,

1241
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:13,300
but it was sort of a great example of how here's a problem I found and the fix got turned

1242
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:14,300
around immediately.

1243
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:16,960
I don't know which bug that is.

1244
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:20,080
You don't recall when you, when you scroll on the dash on the doc.

1245
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:21,080
Oh, that one.

1246
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,080
Yeah.

1247
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:23,080
Yeah.

1248
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:24,080
Yeah.

1249
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:30,400
So, yeah, we've got in 1710, we've got this new Ubuntu gnome, you know, user interface.

1250
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,400
It's new.

1251
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:32,400
He's heard of it before.

1252
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:33,400
It's a bit different for us.

1253
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:36,920
You know, we used to Unity, we've been using it for years and years and years, and we got

1254
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:39,160
this newfangled gnome stuff.

1255
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:44,720
And one of the community guys, Nathan, who was there, noticed that you could use the

1256
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:48,600
mouse wheel to switch between desktops if you hover the mouse in the right place.

1257
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:51,460
But also it did it if you hover the mouse in the wrong place.

1258
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:56,400
And so he walked up to the desktop people with his laptop and went, hey, look at this.

1259
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:01,380
And this, this is, like you say, one of the benefits of like, we're all remote users and

1260
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:05,700
sometimes it's easy to articulate something in a bug report when you type it out.

1261
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:10,040
But it's much easier to just walk up to a desktop developer and show them your laptop

1262
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:12,840
and say, hey, this is, you know, this is the problem.

1263
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:19,600
So he files the bug and upstream, who is someone who happened to not be at the event, turned

1264
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:22,560
around a bug in an hour or so.

1265
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:23,560
And that was fixed.

1266
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:28,460
And it was a, it was a great collaboration between someone who works in the community,

1267
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:33,040
who identified an issue, the Ubuntu developers who are like, yep, this is the component you

1268
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,160
need to file a bug against.

1269
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:38,880
He goes and files a bug, upstream are super attentive and they turn around a fix super

1270
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,320
fast and we'll consume that in Ubuntu.

1271
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:44,200
That's, that is exactly what Ubuntu is all about.

1272
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:47,480
It was pretty neat to watch it, to be there for, oh, here's a problem.

1273
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:49,240
Oh, here's how you reproduce the problem.

1274
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:50,400
Oh, and here's the patch.

1275
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,920
Oh, and upstream's working on it already.

1276
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:55,320
Every bug contributor wish that's what happened every time.

1277
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:59,280
It was great to see just go boom, boom, boom, boom, the whole stage, every stage of the

1278
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,280
process.

1279
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,280
Yeah.

1280
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:02,280
I dream of that every night.

1281
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,280
I wish, right?

1282
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,320
If I could just grab them and make them look at this, how stupid this problem is.

1283
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:07,320
Yeah.

1284
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:10,880
I really had a good time and I actually enjoyed New York a lot more than I thought I would

1285
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:11,880
do.

1286
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:12,880
I don't know.

1287
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:13,880
I went in there.

1288
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:14,880
So the studio's moving.

1289
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:15,880
Is that what you're saying?

1290
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:16,880
Yeah.

1291
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:17,880
Right.

1292
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:18,880
Yeah.

1293
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:19,440
When I want to become a millionaire, when I, when I, when I can afford, when I can afford

1294
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:22,640
to swank pads, yeah.

1295
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:28,680
You know, there was a couple other things that I, I will share as I left that really,

1296
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:29,680
really blew me away.

1297
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:34,080
So for those of you that don't remember, because I don't know if we ever covered any of our

1298
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,840
shows, because why would we?

1299
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:43,720
Back in 2010, your buddy and mine, Mark Shuttleworth, bought himself not just a nice apartment in

1300
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,760
New York, you know, a place to crash.

1301
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:53,960
He bought himself the nicest apartment in New York, a $31.5 million condo in, on the

1302
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:57,840
17th floor, back in 2010.

1303
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:01,680
So there could be some, that could have been some reason as to why Mr. Shuttleworth wanted

1304
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,520
to have an event in New York, but there could also be this.

1305
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:09,760
I was leaving the hotel Wednesday evening and I was all done.

1306
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:10,760
Yep.

1307
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:11,760
Heading out of town.

1308
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,040
I was heading out of town and I, you, there is nothing to confirm this except for my word.

1309
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:17,760
You'll just have to believe me for the story I'm about to tell you.

1310
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:21,440
Hadeah and I are waiting for our car from the valet because that's the only way you

1311
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:25,520
can park at the Hyatt, the Grand Hyatt in Manhattan.

1312
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,000
It's not just any Hyatt.

1313
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
It's the Grand.

1314
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Yeah.

1315
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,920
You, you, you, you are, you are thankful that for $70 a night, they will valet your car

1316
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:37,680
and you will thank them for it and you will tip them for it greatly.

1317
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:44,160
And so as I am waiting for my little car to be returned to me, uh, I am standing in front

1318
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,680
of the rotating, what do you call those doors, Wes?

1319
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:48,640
Those rotating, um, what are those called?

1320
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:49,640
Revolving.

1321
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:50,640
Revolving doors.

1322
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:53,560
There's a series of revolving doors and I'm standing there in front of these gold doors

1323
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:58,040
that are wrapped in gold and they're just beautiful glass swinging doors.

1324
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:00,200
And dude, they weren't gold.

1325
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,200
No, they were.

1326
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,200
On the Mez.

1327
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,200
On the Mez.

1328
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,200
I'm on the Mez.

1329
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,200
I'm on the Mez.

1330
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,200
Not the main entrance.

1331
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,200
The Mez.

1332
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,200
Yeah.

1333
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,400
On the Mez where the, uh, where the, uh, they're very fancy doors where you wait for

1334
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:11,680
your car.

1335
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:20,040
And I, I kid you not, I, these right out of like a 1980s movie, the, the, uh, like a bankers

1336
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:25,360
and like a guy that looks like the lead banker, uh, lawyers and a bunch of lackeys walk up

1337
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:29,680
to me all wearing suits that look like they cost more than I make in a year.

1338
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:32,520
And they're standing next to me and they're going on and they're talking about deals and

1339
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:35,520
they're just yammering and Hadid and I are looking at each other and we're just rolling

1340
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:38,720
our eyes and I got all my stuff packed up and I'm holding it there and I'm just waiting

1341
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:39,720
for my damn car.

1342
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:43,120
And now there's a group of stiffs is standing next to me talking about things from their

1343
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:44,400
little board cube.

1344
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:49,840
And I think that's just really adorable until they start talking about the value in data

1345
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:50,840
centers.

1346
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:51,840
I'm like, Oh, okay.

1347
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:52,840
That's interesting.

1348
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,760
And then they, and I'm, you just have to take my word for this.

1349
01:05:54,760 --> 01:06:00,360
They start talking about the Shuttleworth deal and they're working on the Shuttleworth

1350
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:03,600
deal because they think there's going to be a lot in data centers.

1351
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:07,680
I don't know what that means, but as I was leaving the hotel, you didn't pry for more

1352
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:08,680
info.

1353
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:12,920
You didn't pretend that you were, I was, I was flabbergasted because I was in civilian

1354
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:13,920
mode.

1355
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,920
I had my cameras and my microphones packed up.

1356
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,360
I'm waiting to get in my car.

1357
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:19,360
I'm going to do a hardcore drive.

1358
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:20,360
You're checked out.

1359
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:23,400
I literally totally checked out a hundred percent.

1360
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:27,360
And then these bankers show up, start talking about the Shuttleworth deal and I couldn't

1361
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,660
believe my ears.

1362
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:34,400
What is the, what is the luck that a podcaster with a microphone would be standing next to

1363
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,400
these guys?

1364
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:36,800
And what is the luck of that?

1365
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,120
And so I, that's all I got.

1366
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:39,120
That's it.

1367
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,320
That was the totality of all of the secret information I learned.

1368
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:45,120
But I would suspect there was more to New York than meets the eye.

1369
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:49,960
Dude, if you continue to pack your camera away, you're never going to be the next Casey

1370
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:50,960
Neistat.

1371
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:55,480
I know I could have been the biggest, wouldn't that have been an ending to my inside the

1372
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:56,480
Ubuntu rally vlog.

1373
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,160
That would have been an ending.

1374
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:00,760
Damn it, I didn't even think of that.

1375
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:01,760
Next time.

1376
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:02,760
Yeah.

1377
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:03,760
I'll just have to come back.

1378
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,960
Although the ending that you have is pretty fantastic.

1379
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:06,960
Well thank you.

1380
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:07,960
Yeah.

1381
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:10,840
And well, of course it stars Ike, the very, very ending, which is of course how you want

1382
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:11,840
to end every vlog.

1383
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:12,840
If you can.

1384
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:15,000
I'm just going to have to go to, I'm just going to have to go to that well over and

1385
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
over again.

1386
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Yeah.

1387
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,840
So it was a great trip and it was, that was a funny way to end it.

1388
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:26,080
And it was really neat to see how everybody worked together and how seriously everybody

1389
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:27,320
took that.

1390
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:29,680
It was great to see you and Noah actually.

1391
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:33,800
It was lovely sitting there doing my work on a daily basis and I'd look up every so

1392
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:39,560
often and there's you walking around with a camera and Noah with a startled face every

1393
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:40,560
so often.

1394
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:41,560
Yeah.

1395
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:42,560
That's amazing.

1396
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:43,560
Yeah.

1397
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:46,320
I managed, I managed to constantly keep Noah on his toes while we're going to events like

1398
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:47,320
that.

1399
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:48,320
One way or another I managed.

1400
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:49,320
I think that's your job.

1401
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:50,320
Yeah.

1402
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:52,900
There was also a moment where he and Ike got to get away and have a beer and have a good

1403
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:56,040
chat and I think that was good because they've, they've had disagreements here on this very

1404
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:57,040
show about.

1405
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,040
Yeah.

1406
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:59,040
That was a great spectator sport that evening.

1407
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:00,040
Did you attend that?

1408
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:03,440
I bought beers and popcorn for everyone whilst that conversation was running.

1409
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:04,440
Good for them though, right?

1410
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:08,080
That's exactly the kind of thing you want to have happen at an event like that is just

1411
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:09,080
kind of work it out.

1412
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:11,360
And then, you know, at the end of the day, it sounded like they all kind of came to common

1413
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:12,360
ground.

1414
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:13,360
So that's good.

1415
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:14,360
They did.

1416
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:15,360
Yeah.

1417
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:16,360
All right.

1418
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:17,360
Well, so there you go.

1419
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:18,360
That's the Ubuntu rally.

1420
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:19,900
I actually have, so I have the, the, the vlog that I've now mentioned a couple of times

1421
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:23,680
obnoxiously that's coming out, it's already out, but I have a few more things from our

1422
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:27,400
trip to New York that'll probably be in the next one as well, episode or vlog 59.

1423
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:30,480
I guess they're not called episodes for some reason.

1424
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:36,120
Anyways, I'll have more from New York, including from some of our friends over there at Canonical,

1425
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:39,320
over at youtube.com slash Chris Fisher, if you want to watch that.

1426
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:43,680
And also check out some of the links in the show notes for more information on how to

1427
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:48,540
get involved in elementary OS, as well as the new announcement from the SnapCraft folks

1428
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:56,040
about Chrome 60 being packaged up as a snap and be sure to check out ask Noah 28 where

1429
01:08:56,040 --> 01:09:00,160
in about the second half of that, he has an interview with one of the Canonical developers

1430
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:03,560
about their efforts in Wayland from the Ubuntu rally.

1431
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:08,920
And it just, I, I think just really great audio quality in that interview.

1432
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:12,480
Like some of these interviews came out the best we've ever done from an event like, uh,

1433
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:13,480
on location.

1434
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:15,840
So I think that's how we're going to do our future stuff too, cause like, it sounds like

1435
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:19,640
you're going to do your future stuff in very expensive hotels in New York.

1436
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:21,440
Once you've tasted it, how can you go back?

1437
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:25,460
I meant how we recorded it, but yeah, I mean, when you hear the interview and ask Noah,

1438
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:29,680
you would think that guy was in studio with Noah and they were there in the display server

1439
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:32,640
room, just asking, you know, just having a chat.

1440
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:33,640
Yeah.

1441
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:34,980
So, uh, it really turned out pretty good.

1442
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:39,240
And that's ask Noah 28 and yeah, it was a, it was worth the trip.

1443
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:44,320
I will say it was, we drove for days and days there and back and it was totally worth the

1444
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:45,320
trip.

1445
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:46,320
We drove back.

1446
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:49,920
We stopped in Salt Lake city and that was a lot of fun and I just, yeah, I really enjoyed

1447
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:50,920
it.

1448
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:54,360
I think, um, I would probably do it a little differently and how I got there, but, uh,

1449
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:59,360
I would absolutely do it again because I honestly feel like I'm walking away with years of understanding

1450
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:05,560
and insight into how different community members themselves individually operate and how canonical

1451
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:06,560
operates.

1452
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:10,400
And it's, I would, I would honestly just drive across the country to hang out with you guys.

1453
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:14,600
Sometimes I have, I really enjoy my time with Pope and I do, I just wonderful people.

1454
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:15,600
They really are.

1455
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,040
They really, truly are.

1456
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:21,040
And um, it's so nice because, you know, the episode before I left, I was all worked up

1457
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:25,920
about Linux journalism and certain members in the community that are degrading the conversation.

1458
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:31,180
And then I went to an event where people were just getting shit done and creating really

1459
01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:34,960
good stuff, not like average stuff, but really good stuff.

1460
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:38,260
And then the people there are, or we're all a players.

1461
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:42,220
Just everybody was on the a player team doing their piece and it was a real privilege to

1462
01:10:42,220 --> 01:10:43,220
see all that.

1463
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:49,360
But it was a good sort of contrast from the episode I recorded right before I left.

1464
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:50,360
So yeah.

1465
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:51,360
Yeah.

1466
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:52,360
Yeah.

1467
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:54,040
I would, I would try to make it to a future event if they had it.

1468
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:55,040
All right.

1469
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,800
Well, we're not quite done just yet.

1470
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,800
We have one more really cool thing.

1471
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,320
There's always more on the Linux Unplugged Show.

1472
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:02,320
There is.

1473
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:06,900
Um, our friends over at the Nextcloud project are working on a feature that has been requested

1474
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:11,380
over and over again since probably before Nextcloud was even a project.

1475
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:13,900
So Frank and Yoss are going to join us from the Nextcloud project.

1476
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:17,200
But first got to thank Ting.

1477
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:21,300
Go to linux.ting.com to save a little money, like $25 off a device.

1478
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:26,780
Or if you bring a device and they have CDMA and GSM, guess what you get $25 in service

1479
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:27,780
credit.

1480
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:28,780
What?

1481
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:29,780
No way.

1482
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:30,780
Yeah.

1483
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:31,780
Now my bill will be slightly more this month.

1484
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:32,780
I'll admit it.

1485
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:33,780
I will admit it.

1486
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:36,720
Driving across the country, having only my mobile device means I pay more this month

1487
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:37,720
on Ting.

1488
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:38,720
Everything's more expensive at NYC.

1489
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:39,720
That's true.

1490
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:40,720
That's just how it works.

1491
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:42,580
But the reality is that's what's great about Ting.

1492
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:44,180
You pay for what you use.

1493
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:49,460
So 11 months out of the year, my average bill, like $23.

1494
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:52,220
Now maybe it's going to be $65.

1495
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:53,900
This month I haven't gotten it yet.

1496
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:56,180
Not a big, like that works out.

1497
01:11:56,180 --> 01:11:57,500
That math, that works out.

1498
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:59,900
It's still cheaper than like everyone else's plan.

1499
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:01,580
I just, and that's why it's not a big deal.

1500
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:04,300
Like the one or two months I go over on Ting, I'm like, I don't care.

1501
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:05,300
It's so liberating.

1502
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:06,300
It's surprising.

1503
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:07,300
I was worried, honestly.

1504
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:09,300
I was like, okay, well, if I'm paying for what I use, am I going to be like nickel and

1505
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:12,240
dime in myself in the back of my head, like, don't use data.

1506
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:16,060
But really it's like, if you want to be frugal, you are empowered to do so.

1507
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:19,220
If you just want to pay for the data you use, it's great rates.

1508
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:20,220
Yep.

1509
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:21,220
Yep.

1510
01:12:21,220 --> 01:12:22,220
And no contracts, nationwide coverage.

1511
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:25,460
I used both CDMA and GSM during my coverage or during my trip.

1512
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:32,700
And the coverage was dramatically better than when it was when I went over to Noah's to

1513
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:37,420
do like his tour of his house and his home automation back in last days, a few years

1514
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:38,520
ago.

1515
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:42,420
This time, almost same route, dramatically better coverage.

1516
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:46,420
Really in the past I had, in my past road trip, I had one or two days where I didn't

1517
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:47,420
have coverage.

1518
01:12:47,420 --> 01:12:48,420
Oh yeah, I've been talking about that.

1519
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:49,420
It's like Montana, dude.

1520
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:50,420
It's just like, it's like.

1521
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:51,420
People don't live there.

1522
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:52,420
So why would they put cell towers?

1523
01:12:52,420 --> 01:12:53,900
No, it's way better now.

1524
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:56,740
Like I had, I went from one or two days to one or two hours.

1525
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:57,740
Wow.

1526
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:58,740
Yeah.

1527
01:12:58,740 --> 01:12:59,740
Yeah.

1528
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:04,700
And that's, you know, I was using both the GMA and the CDMA and the GSM networks, which

1529
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:08,420
is my, my, my privilege on the Ting, on the Ting.

1530
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:09,420
I really like it.

1531
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:11,220
Plus it can turn it off when I'm not using it.

1532
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:12,220
That's really nice.

1533
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:13,620
They have a great dashboard to manage all of it.

1534
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:17,200
And because they have CDMA or GSM networks, that means there's more devices they support

1535
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:19,020
that you could just bring with you that you already have.

1536
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,820
Or if you want to buy a device, that's great too.

1537
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:24,900
They have really great prices on devices or you can just get a SIM card and they're giving

1538
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,420
away free data this fall.

1539
01:13:26,420 --> 01:13:29,740
You can get up to additional two gigabytes if you add a line and they have more details.

1540
01:13:29,740 --> 01:13:30,740
Really?

1541
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:33,300
Yeah, they got more details on their blog.

1542
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:34,300
You can check it out.

1543
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:39,800
I'm going to linux.ting.com, linux.ting.com, a smarter way to do mobile.

1544
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:41,700
And thank you to Ting for sponsoring this year's show.

1545
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:44,540
And thanks to you guys for going to linux.ting.com.

1546
01:13:44,540 --> 01:13:47,180
That way you get the discount and you support the show.

1547
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:51,780
Now you guys know I'm a Nextcloud user, so I'm always following the latest updates.

1548
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:55,300
Really excited to have both Jas and Frank join us from the Nextcloud project.

1549
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:58,060
Guys, welcome back to the show.

1550
01:13:58,060 --> 01:13:59,060
Awesome to be here.

1551
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:00,060
I think it's a first for Frank.

1552
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:01,060
Oh, Frank.

1553
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:02,060
Yeah.

1554
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:03,060
Yeah.

1555
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:05,620
I know it's a fun Linux action show, but welcome to Linux Unplugged, Frank.

1556
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:06,620
Absolutely.

1557
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:08,100
Thanks for having me.

1558
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:11,940
Well, guys, you know why you're here.

1559
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:16,540
There is big news in Nextcloud land.

1560
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:21,480
Speaking of land though, Joe and I did cover the details sort of in depth on Linux action

1561
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:23,300
news episode 21.

1562
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:25,060
So if you want to hear that, check that episode out.

1563
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:27,940
But there's a piece I'd like to just deep dive into right off the top.

1564
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:31,420
We can talk about other stuff, but there's one aspect I really want to talk to you guys

1565
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:32,420
about.

1566
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:36,900
It's the new end-to-end encryption, the client-side encryption, because I imagine this is something

1567
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:40,340
you guys have been hearing people ask for for a long time.

1568
01:14:40,340 --> 01:14:45,820
So I'll start with Frank, and then you guys just sort of pass it back and forth as you

1569
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:46,820
feel best.

1570
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:49,940
But Frank, from a project standpoint, how long have you guys been working towards this

1571
01:14:49,940 --> 01:14:50,940
particular goal?

1572
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:54,940
Yeah, that's an excellent question.

1573
01:14:54,940 --> 01:15:01,980
You mentioned already that it's a feature that is requested from the users for a long,

1574
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:02,980
long time.

1575
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:03,980
For many, many years.

1576
01:15:03,980 --> 01:15:06,260
Yeah, I mean, encryption is a big deal to a lot of people.

1577
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:07,260
Absolutely.

1578
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:12,980
It's a totally big deal because the main point of Nextcloud is to secure your data and to

1579
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:16,860
protect your data and privacy and so on in the first place.

1580
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:19,460
And encryption, obviously, is a big part of it.

1581
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:23,100
So we already support different kinds of encryptions for a long time.

1582
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:28,380
So obviously, all the transfer of data over the internet is done via HTTPS, TLS.

1583
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:29,820
So this is already encrypted.

1584
01:15:29,820 --> 01:15:33,960
And then we have server-side encryption, which also helps in some scenarios.

1585
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:40,220
But basically, having the full end-to-end, the client-side encryption, this is new.

1586
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:44,380
This was requested for a long time, for many, many years and discussed.

1587
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:47,940
I mean, there are so many GitHub issues about, should we do it like this or should we do

1588
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:48,940
it like that?

1589
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:53,540
And it actually took a while, as you have noticed, to really do it.

1590
01:15:53,540 --> 01:15:57,480
And the reason is that it's actually hard because this is something where you really

1591
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:03,740
have to do it in a way that it doesn't compromise user experience, that it's really easy to

1592
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:05,100
use and really secure.

1593
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:06,480
And it's also enterprise-ready.

1594
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:12,860
So with enterprise-ready, we mean that it fits into the way companies work, that you

1595
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:18,460
have central key management and compliance regulations and so on.

1596
01:16:18,460 --> 01:16:21,340
So this actually took us a while to do it the right way.

1597
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:23,920
Yeah, I guess I want to just underscore that.

1598
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:27,800
Somebody who's implemented a lot of different solutions for companies over the past decade,

1599
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:31,540
you can kind of get an idea when a project is building in some of the most fundamental

1600
01:16:31,540 --> 01:16:36,420
features from the beginning versus racing to bolt them on after the fact.

1601
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:38,380
And I will definitely give a tip of the hat.

1602
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:42,300
Without having tried it yet, I'll say, just from reading through this, you guys apparently

1603
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:44,780
are doing that from the beginning right.

1604
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:48,100
Like you said, you support creating offline administrator recovery keys.

1605
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:50,220
I thought, okay, that's a great feature.

1606
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:52,880
But then you guys actually took it a step further, and I thought, these sons of guns

1607
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:53,880
really get it.

1608
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:58,900
Because so not only do you have administrative recovery keys, but the users get a warning

1609
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:01,660
that the administrator has used that recovery key.

1610
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:05,840
And that's the kind of thing that I feel like Nextcloud, only Nextcloud does.

1611
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:06,840
I guess put it that way.

1612
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:08,500
It's something that only Nextcloud does.

1613
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:11,580
And so Yas, I wanted to maybe jump over to you for a moment.

1614
01:17:11,580 --> 01:17:16,340
When I read through the post, I have it linked in the show notes, announcing the client-side

1615
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:21,540
encryption, it came across to me, one word that came across to me probably the most predominantly

1616
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:23,020
was, humble.

1617
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:27,320
It felt like a humble, like, we're doing this, we're going to give this a real go, but we

1618
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:29,020
admit we're not totally there yet.

1619
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:31,100
Can you expand on that part for a bit?

1620
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:38,620
Yeah, so first going back a little bit to the thing you said about that, well, that

1621
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:39,780
we warn users, right.

1622
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:41,420
I mean, this is really central.

1623
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:47,220
Like what Frank already said, it is hard to do because you have conflicting requirements

1624
01:17:47,220 --> 01:17:48,860
and conflicting demands.

1625
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:53,460
Like you mentioned the recovery key.

1626
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:56,680
Now when you really think about it, you have end-to-end encryption.

1627
01:17:56,680 --> 01:18:05,220
So that means that the data is encrypted on one device and decrypted on, well, the recipient

1628
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:09,500
device and nothing in between ever gets access to that data.

1629
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:12,060
So what happens if you lose your password?

1630
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:14,580
Well, you lose your data.

1631
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:16,220
That's pretty uncool.

1632
01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:20,620
And I mean, that might be acceptable to some degree for the access security for most home

1633
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:24,700
users, but for an enterprise user, that's of course, well, people forget their password

1634
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:25,940
all the freaking time, right.

1635
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:28,060
This is totally not a solution.

1636
01:18:28,060 --> 01:18:34,740
So you need this recovery key, but then if you enable that, well, that kind of compromises

1637
01:18:34,740 --> 01:18:38,460
security to, well, maybe a limited degree, but still, right.

1638
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:44,900
The way it works is when you enable the recovery key, the data gets encrypted to this key that

1639
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:52,220
is given to the sysadmin and the sysadmin gets a password shown with which his key is

1640
01:18:52,220 --> 01:18:54,580
encrypted and this password is long.

1641
01:18:54,580 --> 01:19:00,300
It's a 12 random words password, so it's really long and it gets shown only once.

1642
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:04,380
That's why we call it an offline key because you have to write it down because if you don't,

1643
01:19:04,380 --> 01:19:09,460
well, once you close that window, there's no way to get this password back.

1644
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:15,180
So if somebody hacks your server, they don't have that password unless you were, well,

1645
01:19:15,180 --> 01:19:19,300
stupid enough, no offense, to copy paste it and then store it on the server.

1646
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:20,300
You shouldn't, right.

1647
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:24,820
You literally should take this offline, put it on a piece of paper or something or a USB

1648
01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:26,620
stick and put it in a vault.

1649
01:19:26,620 --> 01:19:28,700
That's at least what I would suggest.

1650
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:31,700
And there are companies that literally have processes for this and that's what you should

1651
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:32,700
do.

1652
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:41,220
But then this still, to some degree, you compromise security by this because still the admin could

1653
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:45,220
be, you know, well, you could literally put a gun to his or her head and say, okay, give

1654
01:19:45,220 --> 01:19:47,340
me the bloody key, right.

1655
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:50,680
So especially when you're talking about a state actor like a government, they could

1656
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:54,100
simply demand that they have access to this key.

1657
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:58,420
And obviously a lot of people want to use Nextline to protect themselves against that

1658
01:19:58,420 --> 01:19:59,420
specific scenario.

1659
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:01,860
At least it's a part of it.

1660
01:20:01,860 --> 01:20:08,060
So we warn the user that this key is enabled so that people can say, well, I'm using it

1661
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:10,140
as a public provider.

1662
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:14,260
And the moment this provider would enable the key, they would know that their security

1663
01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:21,100
is essentially, well, compromised and they can say, okay, this is not cool, I'm out.

1664
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:23,660
Or they can at least know that it isn't enabled.

1665
01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:30,500
That really is, it's something that, so Apple just published their quote unquote transparency

1666
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:34,380
report, Google publishes one every quarter, so does Facebook, so does Twitter.

1667
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:38,580
A lot of the tech companies publish these transparency reports in which they disclose

1668
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:40,920
that they've just been giving away information constantly.

1669
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:42,460
There's no notification to the end user.

1670
01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:45,080
You don't know if you're one of the people in the disclosure because all the numbers

1671
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:46,200
are randomized.

1672
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:50,820
But in this particular case, the technology is built in such a way that the notification

1673
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:52,540
goes to the user.

1674
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:54,100
The technology is built that way.

1675
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:56,140
That's why I say it feels like something only Nextcloud could do.

1676
01:20:56,140 --> 01:21:00,140
But now I do want to talk about the fact that this is still preview and it seems like there's

1677
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:02,980
a bit of a humble pie in how you guys are approaching this.

1678
01:21:02,980 --> 01:21:03,980
Yes.

1679
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:04,980
Yeah.

1680
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:08,860
The thing is, of course, with that, I mean, security is really hard.

1681
01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:13,780
So first of all, what we already didn't do is like roll our own crypto or something like

1682
01:21:13,780 --> 01:21:14,780
that.

1683
01:21:14,780 --> 01:21:15,780
Right?

1684
01:21:15,780 --> 01:21:18,900
I mean, there's been a lot of debate about, for example, Telegram who had a bunch of really

1685
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:24,300
smart mathematicians and, well, they thought that was good enough to be able to build good

1686
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:25,300
security.

1687
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:27,820
Turns out, well, at least most security experts disagree.

1688
01:21:27,820 --> 01:21:28,820
Right.

1689
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:29,980
I mean, crypto is really hard.

1690
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:31,700
So we don't roll our own.

1691
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:37,980
We tried to find a cross section of algorithms, secure algorithms that are supported on all

1692
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:43,820
the devices we want to support and use that and then just use like standard libraries

1693
01:21:43,820 --> 01:21:50,660
and open SSL on Linux and all the stuff that's available, Android and iOS and use those.

1694
01:21:50,660 --> 01:21:55,660
But of course, it's also pretty well known that usually crypto isn't broken.

1695
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:57,180
It's worked around.

1696
01:21:57,180 --> 01:21:59,060
So it's usually the implementation that's wrong.

1697
01:21:59,060 --> 01:22:00,060
Right.

1698
01:22:00,060 --> 01:22:04,740
There are some pretty famous examples of like devices that had really, really good crypto

1699
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:09,460
but then didn't actually check whether somebody tried to hack it and other stuff.

1700
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:16,540
So what we've done or what we're doing here is trying to put it out as early as possible

1701
01:22:16,540 --> 01:22:20,860
so the wider community can have a look first at our design.

1702
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:25,500
Like is the way we do this, is this actually sensible?

1703
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:28,260
Will this protect the way we think it does?

1704
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:35,380
And that's quite complicated because you're really talking about just to create an identity.

1705
01:22:35,380 --> 01:22:37,420
You're creating a whole bunch of keys.

1706
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:40,180
You're signing some of the keys on the server.

1707
01:22:40,180 --> 01:22:41,180
You need to store them.

1708
01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:44,580
You need to encrypt the keys themselves in the right way, et cetera.

1709
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:46,500
So there's a whole description.

1710
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:50,660
And if you download the white paper, you get even pretty pictures that explain the process

1711
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:56,220
for each of these because it's pretty complicated the way we do it.

1712
01:22:56,220 --> 01:23:03,160
For example, we didn't want that users would have to re-upload data if they would remove

1713
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:07,300
somebody from the access list.

1714
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:10,700
So let's take a do-it-yourself way, right?

1715
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:13,840
And again, this is a great enterprise approach.

1716
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:18,980
You've got employees that get fired or quit and all of a sudden you have to revoke access.

1717
01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:22,820
How do you work around not having to re-encrypt all of the data?

1718
01:23:22,820 --> 01:23:25,180
So that was a key requirement.

1719
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:28,940
And the way we do it is by using a layered approach.

1720
01:23:28,940 --> 01:23:33,180
So we encrypt each file with a unique key.

1721
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:40,220
And then that key is stored in a metadata file, which is encrypted with a metadata key.

1722
01:23:40,220 --> 01:23:45,500
And this key is in turn encrypted against all the people who have access to it.

1723
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:51,180
So when you remove someone, all you have to do is create a new metadata key and re-encrypt

1724
01:23:51,180 --> 01:23:52,180
it.

1725
01:23:52,180 --> 01:23:53,180
That makes sense.

1726
01:23:53,180 --> 01:23:57,060
You don't have to re-upload or re-download all the data.

1727
01:23:57,060 --> 01:24:02,860
And this is just one example and we have many places where you have this multi-layer affair.

1728
01:24:02,860 --> 01:24:07,100
And obviously we want to know from people whether they think it makes sense and whether

1729
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:11,500
we didn't make any logical mistakes.

1730
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:14,720
Obviously we've been working on this for a while, we have experience with this.

1731
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:20,020
We use similar technologies with the server-side encryption that also uses this layered approach,

1732
01:24:20,020 --> 01:24:21,380
but a lot less complicated.

1733
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:26,060
I can tell you I was working on white paper for this and I wanted to make nice pictures

1734
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:27,060
of it.

1735
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:31,260
And I looked at the pictures for server-side encryption and they had like in every area

1736
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:32,780
they had two or three steps.

1737
01:24:32,780 --> 01:24:35,860
So I needed only to make two or three icons.

1738
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:38,300
Well here it's like six or seven.

1739
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:43,260
So it was really quite a pain in the ass to kind of portray it in a simple way.

1740
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:46,100
So actually I didn't have to do it.

1741
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:49,220
I let our designer help with that.

1742
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:55,700
But because it's complicated, well yeah it looks good I think, but the thing is of course

1743
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:56,700
it's complicated.

1744
01:24:56,700 --> 01:25:01,300
And it would be stupid of us to assume that in our company even though we have I think

1745
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:06,340
very clever people to think that we have all the knowledge in-house to do this in a truly

1746
01:25:06,340 --> 01:25:07,340
secure way.

1747
01:25:07,340 --> 01:25:08,340
I like that.

1748
01:25:08,340 --> 01:25:13,300
And so it seems like a very open-handed approach to the community to ask for guidance.

1749
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:17,300
There's a question that's coming in that I'd also like to know from Timelord, which I really

1750
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:20,820
feel honored that he traveled through time and space to ask this question.

1751
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:25,940
He says, I don't understand generally how are multiple devices handled like a phone

1752
01:25:25,940 --> 01:25:26,940
and a desktop?

1753
01:25:26,940 --> 01:25:31,060
How do the keys that get you access to the encryption get transferred between those multiple

1754
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:32,060
devices?

1755
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:33,060
Yeah.

1756
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:34,060
Yeah.

1757
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:37,860
So I mean Frank I see you wanted to say something.

1758
01:25:37,860 --> 01:25:39,860
I mean I can explain it.

1759
01:25:39,860 --> 01:25:40,860
No, no, go on, go on.

1760
01:25:40,860 --> 01:25:42,860
I had something related to it.

1761
01:25:42,860 --> 01:25:43,860
All right.

1762
01:25:43,860 --> 01:25:48,580
So the way that works is when you create an identity it is the very first step like you

1763
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:54,860
choose to client-side encrypt the folder and at that point identity is created for you.

1764
01:25:54,860 --> 01:26:00,100
And this is a public and a private key and the public key becomes part of certificate

1765
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:05,940
that's signed by the server which is your secure identity so people can download that

1766
01:26:05,940 --> 01:26:07,460
identity from the server and check.

1767
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:10,420
Signed by your next cloud, your own personal next cloud server?

1768
01:26:10,420 --> 01:26:11,420
Exactly.

1769
01:26:11,420 --> 01:26:12,420
Yes, exactly.

1770
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:13,980
You can't change by the way.

1771
01:26:13,980 --> 01:26:20,340
We've done this in such a way because if somebody would take over the server and then create

1772
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:26,020
a new identity for you and then well ask all the people you shared with to re-encrypt

1773
01:26:26,020 --> 01:26:31,740
their data or at least a metadata key as we discussed for the new identity of yours they

1774
01:26:31,740 --> 01:26:33,940
will be able to get access to your data.

1775
01:26:33,940 --> 01:26:39,820
So you can't change an identity once it's created and you've shared with someone else

1776
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:45,700
they download your identity, they check if it is signed by the server and after that

1777
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:51,340
they will store it locally and if the identity would change they wouldn't trust that.

1778
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:54,400
So it's trust on first use tofu as they say.

1779
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:58,700
So that's about the sharing but back to the multiple devices case.

1780
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:06,100
So we wanted to make it as easy as possible for people of course to add multiple devices

1781
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:09,020
but at the same time it had to be foolproof.

1782
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:12,940
Now foolproof already means you don't let people pick their own password and you try

1783
01:27:12,940 --> 01:27:15,820
not to give them an opportunity to forget it either.

1784
01:27:15,820 --> 01:27:19,260
So you're taking out the human factor.

1785
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:22,460
Well to some degree.

1786
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:26,460
This is like maybe if I can jump in like the human factor this is actually what makes everything

1787
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:27,460
difficult.

1788
01:27:27,460 --> 01:27:28,460
Absolutely.

1789
01:27:28,460 --> 01:27:32,580
Because if you think that encryption when we said earlier that encryption is hard sure

1790
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:36,820
there's an absolutely hard mathematical part to it like the actual encryption algorithm

1791
01:27:36,820 --> 01:27:38,780
but this is something we don't invent.

1792
01:27:38,780 --> 01:27:43,820
We use standard AES encryption for that though this already exists but a human factor in

1793
01:27:43,820 --> 01:27:49,940
the right process is like you said this is the difficult part to make it really secure

1794
01:27:49,940 --> 01:27:54,700
because sorry for Joss for interrupting but I find it's an interesting aspect that if

1795
01:27:54,700 --> 01:27:59,820
you would allow people to pick their own passwords they probably would pick the same password

1796
01:27:59,820 --> 01:28:06,180
than the normal login password from the company from the company active directory which is

1797
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:10,700
then controlled by the admin they would probably use the same password which why I have two

1798
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:17,420
different passwords right and then the feature is sort of useless because then it's all if

1799
01:28:17,420 --> 01:28:21,100
you hack the server and you have the password then you can also decrypt the data.

1800
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:25,580
But this is why I picked this approach that the password is generated for the user and

1801
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:30,020
then of course the question is okay if you present this super long super secure password

1802
01:28:30,020 --> 01:28:35,460
to the user how do they even I mean they can remember it but can they even write it down.

1803
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:42,220
I mean try to write down like whatever 50 character hex passwords that's no one gets

1804
01:28:42,220 --> 01:28:46,340
this right but if you actually pick real words then it actually becomes possible.

1805
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:51,820
So sorry Joss for interrupting but this is this human factor which is the difficult part

1806
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:52,820
in this process.

1807
01:28:52,820 --> 01:28:55,900
Yeah it makes a hundred percent sense Frank actually.

1808
01:28:55,900 --> 01:28:59,740
So I was when I said the human factor I was serious I mean encryption is hard but not

1809
01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:02,500
for computers it's hard for humans really.

1810
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:06,100
And I exactly you know Frank I actually wanted to ask you something while I have you just

1811
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:08,500
sort of to match the theme of today's show.

1812
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:12,180
One of the conversations you and I had offline a long time ago and I know it's something

1813
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:18,500
you've mentioned before on air with me too is the difficulty in some distributions and

1814
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:22,120
this is getting better than it was at the time you and I chatted but ship shipping old

1815
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:26,000
versions at the time it was own cloud and now next cloud that are still vulnerable not

1816
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,420
necessarily supported.

1817
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:32,660
So I'm curious to see what you think now about the evolution of universal packages to sort

1818
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:35,540
of solve this problem like flat packs and snaps in particular.

1819
01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:39,220
Are you following this at all and do you have any particular interest from a next cloud

1820
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:40,220
perspective.

1821
01:29:40,220 --> 01:29:41,220
Oh absolutely.

1822
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:43,220
I'm absolutely following that.

1823
01:29:43,220 --> 01:29:49,260
I mean I tried to a long time ago a long time ago and another like hobby project called

1824
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:55,700
the project which I tried to do with the open to the guys together to somehow solve

1825
01:29:55,700 --> 01:30:03,260
this by this basically enable software developers to ship like new versions of the software

1826
01:30:03,260 --> 01:30:04,260
directly to the end user.

1827
01:30:04,260 --> 01:30:08,420
And this was an idea even long before own cloud or next cloud even existed.

1828
01:30:08,420 --> 01:30:09,900
So I'm totally following that.

1829
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:13,740
That's basically one of my pet pet topics.

1830
01:30:13,740 --> 01:30:20,020
So I think what's going on at the moment with like the flat pack guys and like like in the

1831
01:30:20,020 --> 01:30:22,700
server world more like docker containers.

1832
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:23,820
This makes total sense.

1833
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:25,820
I mean this is just this makes total sense.

1834
01:30:25,820 --> 01:30:31,820
I mean in the old days like 20 years ago and longer than that like Linux distributions

1835
01:30:31,820 --> 01:30:37,980
actually had the job of basically collecting all the source code files all the files that

1836
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:44,820
are floating around on the Internet by packaging it compiling it and putting it on floppy disk

1837
01:30:44,820 --> 01:30:51,580
or CDs and ship it to the users and then hey this and on this CD you have everything that

1838
01:30:51,580 --> 01:30:55,460
exists in the Linux world like and you can use it.

1839
01:30:55,460 --> 01:30:58,900
But this idea of course is obviously no longer works.

1840
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:03,740
So we have to do we have to do something in a way how it exists in the mobile world for

1841
01:31:03,740 --> 01:31:08,820
a long time that you have an operating system which is it comes from someone and then you

1842
01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:13,480
have like the applications and the applications that come directly from the software developers

1843
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:16,980
via an app store or some other distribution mechanism.

1844
01:31:16,980 --> 01:31:22,180
And this makes total sense and this is what we like to do and then the next load too.

1845
01:31:22,180 --> 01:31:26,980
So in the future I hope that we can basically have a way to that we shipped our clients

1846
01:31:26,980 --> 01:31:33,220
directly to users without basically going through the packaging of the distribution.

1847
01:31:33,220 --> 01:31:36,660
We have an app image right now as of today.

1848
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:41,940
As a download from our server you can download an app image and this is already quite popular.

1849
01:31:41,940 --> 01:31:47,860
So the app image is getting subtraction.

1850
01:31:47,860 --> 01:31:53,020
Yeah well it is the only thing that we make right because for the other packages we rely

1851
01:31:53,020 --> 01:31:57,940
on the distributions themselves and if you have you know SUSE and Fedora and you know

1852
01:31:57,940 --> 01:32:02,580
most of the distribution simply have packages they have an active team that keeps the packages

1853
01:32:02,580 --> 01:32:03,580
up to date.

1854
01:32:03,580 --> 01:32:04,580
Right.

1855
01:32:04,580 --> 01:32:10,060
But of course if they're not rolling release we're back to this problem of outdated software

1856
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:14,580
and yeah if you then get the app image directly from us you don't have that problem.

1857
01:32:14,580 --> 01:32:19,060
So guys I wanted to just sort of set the expectations with the audience as far as how baked this

1858
01:32:19,060 --> 01:32:23,380
feature this client side encryption is and when they could expect it to start rolling

1859
01:32:23,380 --> 01:32:25,940
out as like a really full-fledged feature.

1860
01:32:25,940 --> 01:32:29,020
So who wants to tackle that one?

1861
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:32,060
I'll leave it to you Frank.

1862
01:32:32,060 --> 01:32:33,060
Sure.

1863
01:32:33,060 --> 01:32:38,900
So this is as Jan already described at the moment what we have is a pre-release.

1864
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:44,020
You can play around with it there will be like will get better there will be desktop

1865
01:32:44,020 --> 01:32:49,260
client support and iOS support coming in the next few days so really fast but this is all

1866
01:32:49,260 --> 01:32:52,740
in the preview in which we wanted to do to have like early feedback.

1867
01:32:52,740 --> 01:32:57,100
So if you don't really want to test this or if you don't really care about giving feedback

1868
01:32:57,100 --> 01:33:01,580
if you only want to use like something that's stable and production ready then this will

1869
01:33:01,580 --> 01:33:04,900
be as part of next cloud 13.

1870
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:11,580
The next cloud 13 is the next big release of next cloud and this is scheduled I can't

1871
01:33:11,580 --> 01:33:16,100
give you a like a real date at the moment but this year.

1872
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:21,300
So later this year later this year and this will be one of the main features not the only

1873
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:25,100
big features there will be a lot more interesting stuff but one of the main features of next

1874
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:26,100
cloud 13.

1875
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:27,100
So later this year.

1876
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:30,620
Well I can't wait and if you do want to try out the current preview version grab next

1877
01:33:30,620 --> 01:33:36,460
cloud version 12.0.3 which I will be grabbing to kick the tires Joss Frank guys thank you

1878
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:41,540
for coming on the show and really really happy to hear about this feature hitting next cloud

1879
01:33:41,540 --> 01:33:47,740
just keep up the great work okay always all done by the community of course not by us

1880
01:33:47,740 --> 01:33:54,140
well of course of course no not a lot of code is written by you know which is actually good

1881
01:33:54,140 --> 01:34:01,620
yeah especially when it comes to the encryption stuff right guys well I really do appreciate

1882
01:34:01,620 --> 01:34:05,500
you coming on the show and keeping us up to date and I will give that a good of it a try

1883
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:11,340
is there anything else you guys want to mention before we run I'll go try it out and of course

1884
01:34:11,340 --> 01:34:16,540
download the white paper but if you try it out I mean the changes we make might even

1885
01:34:16,540 --> 01:34:22,860
break the decryption of data that was encrypted of earlier version so seriously don't use

1886
01:34:22,860 --> 01:34:29,460
this on any production data it's nice to play with but nothing more just good a big one

1887
01:34:29,460 --> 01:34:32,540
yeah that's a great warning and I will do that I will I will keep that in mind when

1888
01:34:32,540 --> 01:34:37,060
I test it so thank you guys very much for coming on the show all right well that will

1889
01:34:37,060 --> 01:34:41,620
bring us to the end of this week's episode of the unplugged program you know Mr. West

1890
01:34:41,620 --> 01:34:44,400
is there anywhere we should send people before we go this week what do you think is there

1891
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:48,680
any like advice you have for the good people at home well I think they should go check

1892
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:53,500
out at Westpane and make sure they come join us at Seagull that's right of course another

1893
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:57,620
plug for that and of course a plug for the vlog youtube.com slash Chris Fisher to see

1894
01:34:57,620 --> 01:35:03,060
inside that Ubuntu rally we'll be back next week with reports from Seagull that's right

1895
01:35:03,060 --> 01:35:06,720
assuming I get my SD card in time from Amazon because that's gonna be a problem fingers

1896
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:12,740
crossed and you can join us live go over to jblive.tv to tune in for that shenanigans

1897
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:16,580
get it converted by robots to your local time zone at Jupiterbroadcasting.com and join the

1898
01:35:16,580 --> 01:35:20,300
subreddit over at linuxunpluggediredit.com and go to Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash contact

1899
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:24,920
to get a hold of us thanks for joining us and we'll see you right back here next Tuesday

1900
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:51,900
say goodbye West goodbye
