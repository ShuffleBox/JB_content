WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.800
I think we've got to talk about this. A new Dell XPS Ubuntu edition has shipped,

00:04.800 --> 00:09.280
and I have a ton of respect for what our friends over at Dell have done with the Sputnik line,

00:09.280 --> 00:14.240
and I understand that they're just kind of revalidating and rebadging an existing product.

00:14.240 --> 00:19.600
There is an XPS 13 for Windows, but the XPS 13 Plus Developer Edition

00:19.600 --> 00:26.160
has what they call a new radical look, and it seems that Dell's design team is about four years

00:26.160 --> 00:31.040
behind Apple. We've got what is essentially a butterfly chiclet keyboard, the function

00:31.040 --> 00:39.360
row has been replaced by touch LED lights, there's no escape key, and it has two ports, USB-C both.

00:39.920 --> 00:45.120
Why? I think it was well proven that these things were not helpful for anyone.

00:46.320 --> 00:49.200
I wonder what the meeting room was like that day.

00:49.200 --> 00:54.400
Right, after years of Apple getting grief from MacBook customers about the touch bar

00:54.400 --> 00:58.880
and getting rid of the escape key, and then them specifically, after years,

00:58.880 --> 01:05.440
reverting those changes, and just as they do that, Dell comes out with this, and I don't get it,

01:05.440 --> 01:11.920
because it also feels like now is the worst time to mess this kind of thing up in this product

01:11.920 --> 01:17.280
category. Dell essentially helped create part of this category with the Sputnik line,

01:17.280 --> 01:23.920
along with others like System76. It was their game to lose. They were the largest

01:23.920 --> 01:29.360
OEM. They were one of the best options for enterprises that wanted an Ubuntu system.

01:30.080 --> 01:36.080
And with this, it feels like they're just ceding their market to their competitors with the Dev1

01:36.080 --> 01:41.760
and the new Lemur and other laptops, like lots of Linux laptops now, some directly from

01:41.760 --> 01:47.840
distributions. Is this maybe a signal that even with the seemingly good support that the community

01:47.840 --> 01:52.800
has shown for adopting Sputnik, for doing reviews, for talking about it on entertainment and

01:52.800 --> 01:57.760
educational shows, that it's still a relatively small signal compared to whatever signals they

01:57.760 --> 02:02.880
think, you know, the folks who are setting the direction for this whole line are receiving up

02:02.880 --> 02:07.440
the chain? Because as you say, right, like the good side of this is they're committed to making

02:07.440 --> 02:11.600
a Linux version of what they're selling. The bad side is it doesn't seem like what Linux users

02:11.600 --> 02:29.040
might want is exactly factoring up into what that product looks like. Hello, friends, and welcome

02:29.040 --> 02:34.560
back to your weekly Linux talk show. My name is Chris. My name is Les, and my name is Brent.

02:34.560 --> 02:39.920
Hello, gentlemen, coming up on the show today, we're going to take a sleeper distro. Maybe

02:39.920 --> 02:44.000
you've heard of but never really looked at packed full of modern Linux technologies,

02:44.000 --> 02:48.960
even though it has kind of a more traditional long term support release cycle. And it is also

02:48.960 --> 02:55.600
the final distribution in our summer of a mutable Linux journey. And it is fittingly endless OS.

02:55.600 --> 03:00.720
An old friend is going to join the show in a little bit and go deep into endless OS with us.

03:00.720 --> 03:05.920
Plus, today is the day we are pulling names from our JPL hat to determine who is actually going to

03:05.920 --> 03:10.160
join us for our JPL tour. Then we'll round out the show with some boosts, some picks,

03:10.720 --> 03:14.880
and a lot more. So before we go any further, let's say time appropriate greetings to our

03:14.880 --> 03:19.280
virtual lug. Hello, Mumble Room. Good morning. Hello, Chris. Hey, Brent, and hey, Wes.

03:19.280 --> 03:21.280
Hello, you guys. Hello. Hello.

03:21.280 --> 03:25.920
Great to see you in there. Plus, I think a record setter for our quiet listening room

03:25.920 --> 03:30.960
in weeks as we transition our mainstream over to our PeerTube instance at jupyter.tube. I

03:30.960 --> 03:34.320
think a lot of people are saying, hey, you know what I want? I want a high quality

03:34.320 --> 03:38.640
Opus stream that's super low latency. And then go get Mumble. And then you have Mumble set up

03:38.640 --> 03:43.680
for other stuff as well. So welcome in, everybody. Also, a big good morning to Tailscale. Our

03:43.680 --> 03:48.720
friends over at tailscale.com have created a mesh VPN protected by WireGuard's noise protocol.

03:49.440 --> 03:54.000
It's like peak WireGuard implementation, the kind of thing you hope somebody would build when we

03:54.000 --> 03:59.520
first started talking about WireGuard. It's here, and it's a game changer. Go build a mesh network

03:59.520 --> 04:05.200
just for yourself using Tailscale. Go say good morning and get it for free up to 20 devices

04:05.200 --> 04:12.080
at tailscale.com. So this week, Gnome launched a new telemetry program to help, quote,

04:12.080 --> 04:18.400
improve Gnome. We've talked about data collection before on the show with mixed opinions, I think,

04:18.400 --> 04:23.600
from the virtual lug and from your hosts. Gnome has created this tool directly. It's not preinstalled

04:23.600 --> 04:29.280
on any distribution or with any version of Gnome. It collects your Linux distro and its version

04:29.280 --> 04:34.000
obviously, your hardware OEM model CPU, et cetera, that it can kind of grok from the system.

04:34.560 --> 04:38.320
It checks to see if you have Flatpak, and if you do, if FlatHub is enabled.

04:38.320 --> 04:42.720
It looks to see what applications in Gnome are pinned to the dock, you know, your favorites

04:42.720 --> 04:47.600
in Gnome. It checks to see what Gnome extensions you have installed. I think we should come back

04:47.600 --> 04:52.560
to that. And it checks to see what your default browser is. It's called Gnome Info Collect,

04:53.600 --> 04:57.840
and it's out there right now for anyone who wants to grab it and run it on their own system.

04:57.840 --> 05:03.120
They've got SUSE packages available, Arch package available, Fedora package available,

05:03.120 --> 05:07.200
and a SNAP available. I don't know. I'm curious to know what you think, guys. But this seems to me

05:07.200 --> 05:12.480
like perhaps the best compromise we have seen yet of this information collected. It's voluntary.

05:12.480 --> 05:16.560
You have to go get it yourself in the download page where you go to get it. They tell you what

05:16.560 --> 05:21.520
they're collecting. Wes, you gave it a go before the show. I did, although, you know, I thought

05:21.520 --> 05:26.320
I'd try to be a little bit of a troll and try it out on a plasma system. It was too smart for that,

05:26.320 --> 05:31.520
though. So, yeah, no dice. You got to run it from a Gnome system. But it's super simple. I really

05:31.520 --> 05:35.760
like that. It's just a little Python app. They do ask for some help getting it packaged. So if

05:35.760 --> 05:39.840
those are skills you have, maybe go take a look. But it's really easy to run. It doesn't have a

05:39.840 --> 05:44.960
ton of dependencies. And, of course, it's all open source, seemingly including the bits that

05:44.960 --> 05:49.440
run the server. Oh, that's an interesting observation. I wasn't aware of that. I notice

05:49.440 --> 05:54.160
it's not yet packaged for Nix. Though I think someone in our Nix nerds matrix chat room did

05:54.160 --> 05:58.480
create a flake for it, right? Looking at you, Kenji. That's great, Kenji. Thank you. Brent,

05:58.480 --> 06:01.680
how do you feel about this stuff? I know you're probably one of the more privacy-conscious ones

06:02.240 --> 06:06.400
on the show. This is pretty voluntary. It doesn't come pre-shipped, although I actually think it'd

06:06.400 --> 06:10.080
be more beneficial if it did. And at the end of the Gnome setup wizard, it asks you to collect

06:10.080 --> 06:16.640
this info because you're going to get such a tiny skewed demo that downloads and tries this. But

06:17.280 --> 06:21.600
is this just the compromise we have to make? Well, I think having a choice is actually really

06:21.600 --> 06:26.080
refreshing. We've talked about this several times in the past, I think. But to have it be

06:26.800 --> 06:30.720
written in a language and be open source, so at least if you're really interested, you can go see

06:30.720 --> 06:35.200
what's happening. And that they're so upfront about what's being collected, I think, is really

06:35.200 --> 06:39.200
helpful. And that, to me, even feels like, OK, well, if that's what they're looking for, I could

06:39.200 --> 06:45.120
see from a developer's point of view how useful that might be for them to target certain systems

06:45.120 --> 06:50.000
and certain applications and user interfaces and stuff like that. So I think it's really just the

06:50.000 --> 06:53.680
transparency that's helpful. If you know what they're collecting and you think it's helpful

06:53.680 --> 06:58.080
and you want to help in that way, and that's a good way for you to help, then I don't see why

06:58.080 --> 07:04.320
this is harmful in any way. So I would say, let it be a choice. And let them be upfront about it

07:04.320 --> 07:08.720
in the installer, too. It's helpful. I am almost hesitating to really say this, but it's happening.

07:08.720 --> 07:12.720
As Gnome becomes feature complete, or they settle on the features they want to support,

07:13.520 --> 07:18.320
doesn't it seem natural that they would look towards extensions and what extensions their

07:18.320 --> 07:23.120
community are using the most and then seeing if they have a way they could just safely build that

07:23.120 --> 07:27.760
into Gnome itself? And so one of the things that jumped out at me on this is they're checking to

07:27.760 --> 07:33.040
see what extensions are installed on a Gnome system. And I think that could be a significant

07:33.040 --> 07:37.360
data point for them. In my personal opinion, I think for a long time, there's been a culture

07:37.360 --> 07:42.880
of underplaying extensions for some of the Gnome developers. And so getting data like this,

07:42.880 --> 07:46.800
where you're going to see there is some consistent extensions, and I can just tell this is, you know,

07:46.800 --> 07:51.920
I've been using Gnome very consistently since Gnome 3.12. I took a break for a little while,

07:51.920 --> 07:56.080
but came back around 3.12. And I've always had it on some of my systems since then. And you can

07:56.080 --> 07:59.440
tell if anybody who's been running it for this long, you can look at the extension page, you can

07:59.440 --> 08:03.600
see what developers update after Gnome release, you can sort by popularity, you get an idea of

08:03.600 --> 08:08.480
which ones are getting feedback. And you can tell some of those extensions are probably on like 80%

08:08.480 --> 08:13.200
of Gnome systems out there. They're just maybe pre-installed by a distro maker. So it'd be great

08:13.200 --> 08:17.040
for them to get that signal. And you got to appreciate that, you know, of course, like all

08:17.040 --> 08:21.840
open source projects, Gnome has limited time and resources. So I like how they framed some of this

08:21.840 --> 08:27.040
data collection around like, how much should we be investing in static workplaces? Are people using

08:27.040 --> 08:30.880
them? Now, obviously, there's some issues around folks with installs that aren't going to configure

08:30.880 --> 08:36.080
this and how this all plays out. But it seems reasonable to sort of say like, hey, this is an

08:36.080 --> 08:40.560
easy way for you to help shape the future of the software you're using. There's also the possibility

08:40.560 --> 08:44.960
that somebody like me who does like static workspace on my secondary screens and a moving

08:44.960 --> 08:49.200
workspace on my main screen, that's been working really well for me. Maybe I'm the only person that

08:49.200 --> 08:53.520
uses that. And so they decide by the data, they're going to take that away and I'll be sad. So I

08:53.520 --> 08:58.880
should prepare myself for that kind of thing. Go install it on more systems, maybe. Yeah, I'll go

08:58.880 --> 09:05.840
spin up 30 VMs. Dan, you were pointing out that Plasma is doing something similar as well, right?

09:05.840 --> 09:12.960
Yeah, they have the KUserFeedback thing that is incorporated. So I probably knew that,

09:12.960 --> 09:18.560
but I think I just totally forgot about KUserFeedback. But I'm glad. I'm glad they have it.

09:18.560 --> 09:22.960
Yeah, it's set to disabled by default, but you can increase the amount of information you want

09:22.960 --> 09:26.880
to give them. I'm all for it. Volunteer the information you want on the systems you don't

09:26.880 --> 09:31.360
want on the grid. Don't install these tools. Don't use these tools. It's a really nice compromise.

09:31.360 --> 09:35.680
Kenji brought up another point that's worthwhile, I think maybe is, are we going to get to see these

09:35.680 --> 09:40.000
stats down the road? So like all the stuff to collect it is open, but what kind of is it going

09:40.000 --> 09:44.880
to be just internal to the GNOME team or is it going to be published in some way? I didn't see

09:44.880 --> 09:48.960
any answers about that, although I didn't do a ton of searching admittedly. That's a great question.

09:48.960 --> 09:53.840
I hadn't even thought of that. I'd like to know. Why not? I bet they will. I'll read through,

09:53.840 --> 09:59.600
I'll read through their GitHub post and see if they say it. I actually don't recall them addressing

09:59.600 --> 10:03.760
it, but it looks like, you know, if the backend is open source, they're being really transparent

10:03.760 --> 10:10.400
about all of this. I wouldn't be too surprised if we see that. Now we're doing a little cleaning

10:10.400 --> 10:14.880
right here at the top of the show, so we got some housekeeping for you. Big updates for our West

10:14.880 --> 10:23.120
Coast meetups. The venues are in and with a little bit of planning, it turned out that we're going to

10:23.120 --> 10:30.160
breweries for all of them. It's a brewery tour and they're all incredible. Every single venue looks

10:30.160 --> 10:36.960
fantastic. And this is a big thank you to our West Coast crew. Our matrix room helped my wife

10:36.960 --> 10:45.280
Adia narrow down all of the best possible venues. So if you're in Southern Oregon area, and I hope

10:45.280 --> 10:50.080
even nearby, if you're in the Sacramento area, if you're in the Southern California area, if you're

10:50.080 --> 10:56.720
in the Portland area, we've got meetups for you. We've got swag ordered. We have geo caches we'll

10:56.720 --> 11:02.560
be deploying. It's getting really set up, guys. And I've been working for about three weekends straight

11:02.560 --> 11:08.240
on just getting Jup's road ready. She's going to be looking sharp when you see her. She'll be

11:08.240 --> 11:12.240
nearby at some of these places. So go sign up. We need to know if you're coming or not so we can

11:12.240 --> 11:18.560
start telling the venues how many people to expect. Meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting for that.

11:18.560 --> 11:26.960
And then get in that West Coast crew chat room. That's bit.ly slash West Coast crew. It's pretty easy.

11:26.960 --> 11:31.040
I thought it should be West Coast crew with no tea, but you know, I got outvoted. Yeah,

11:31.040 --> 11:36.320
get get the West crew in there. You know, get the West crew representing. I feel like that might be

11:36.320 --> 11:40.800
the the Knicks nerds chat room. I bet they're a bunch of Oh, maybe I bet they're a bunch of West

11:40.800 --> 11:49.520
fans. All right, well, so now before we get into our main topic today, we've been waiting weeks

11:49.520 --> 11:54.880
to pull the names out of the hat to see who will go to JPL. Wes has run the scripts.

11:58.960 --> 12:06.320
All right, here we go. Coming in right now. We have a chosen few. I'll just I'll say first names,

12:06.320 --> 12:11.920
but we'll be reaching out via email as well. Michael J, you are in. Fern, you are in.

12:13.360 --> 12:19.760
Valdall? Why you gotta do me like that? You're in. AJS, you're in. Greg, you are in. Oliver T is in.

12:19.760 --> 12:28.080
Anyone Andrew, you're in. Joshua M is in. Bloodpath, you're in. I look forward to telling JPL that

12:28.080 --> 12:31.600
Bloodpath will be attending. That'll be good. This is what we got when we allowed handles for

12:31.600 --> 12:40.160
submissions, but it seems natural for our community. Mikey G, you are in. Tyler L, you are in. Eric P,

12:40.160 --> 12:46.640
you are in. Jonathan M, you are in. David H, you are in. And Mr. Optimus Gray is in.

12:47.440 --> 12:53.280
We have a few others we may be reaching out to directly as well, because I didn't see Jeremy's

12:53.280 --> 12:58.480
name in this list, but we do have a slot for listener Jeremy who wrote in too. Oh yeah,

12:58.480 --> 13:03.200
these were just the ones that were, you know, right. Rando picked right there. Boom. Very good.

13:03.200 --> 13:07.200
Congratulations, everybody. Thank you so much for signing up. We hope to see you there.

13:07.200 --> 13:12.080
Well, you better come because you committed. But you are the chosen few. You check the box. If you

13:12.080 --> 13:16.160
can't just no, no hard feelings. Just let us know as soon as you find that out. We've got some

13:16.160 --> 13:20.720
reserve names that we will draw from in the event that happens. Yep. So if you didn't hear your name

13:20.720 --> 13:25.600
called, you are probably then on the reserve list. That was neat. That worked out really well. Again,

13:25.600 --> 13:31.520
we used our next cloud instance to do this. So it's all using a free software stack. And then

13:31.520 --> 13:35.520
Wes used some tools we'll talk about in a little bit in the show to sort of sort everything out

13:35.520 --> 13:41.280
and parse it. But there you go. Oh, my gosh. That's a big moment. We actually have our list

13:41.280 --> 13:47.200
of JPL tour attendees. It's real. It's real now. I got an email from Tim a couple of days ago,

13:47.200 --> 13:49.840
which I got to get back to. It said, hey, what's your schedule?

13:49.840 --> 13:56.960
So we had to get we had to get this done, right? We had to figure this out. So we got it figured

13:56.960 --> 14:00.240
out and hopefully we got it with enough time everybody can get their travel plans in. But

14:00.240 --> 14:04.960
like Wes said, if you can't, you can contact the show Linux Unplugged dot com slash contact or

14:04.960 --> 14:10.160
reach out to myself or Wes and let us know when we can slot someone else in on that list.

14:13.760 --> 14:18.320
Leno dot com slash unplugged. Go there to get one hundred dollars and sixty day credit on a

14:18.320 --> 14:22.720
new account and you go there to support the show. Linode makes cloud computing simple, affordable

14:22.720 --> 14:28.160
and accessible. It's fast and reliable. It's the best hosting in the business. Real humans

14:28.160 --> 14:31.840
every day can help you. And it's what we've used for every project we've built and deployed in

14:31.840 --> 14:38.080
the cloud for nearly three years now. It's really powerful. It's fast. Eleven data centers around

14:38.080 --> 14:42.800
the world and they have an interface that everyone on our team can interact with at their own skill

14:42.800 --> 14:46.720
level. Like you can use back end automation tools, which I really appreciate, or you can

14:46.720 --> 14:51.520
use their really simple cloud dashboard, their API, their command line tool. There's a lot there

14:51.520 --> 14:56.160
and it's made it really possible for us to work collaboratively on this new website that, yeah,

14:56.160 --> 15:00.160
we're deploying on Linode. Where else would we deploy something like this? And of course,

15:00.160 --> 15:05.520
Linode also has that S3 compatible object storage, that object storage, which I just absolutely

15:05.520 --> 15:10.480
love. You put it all together with the performance, the support, and then it really seals the deal

15:10.480 --> 15:14.320
with the pricing. They're 30 to 50 percent cheaper than the major hyperscalers out there,

15:14.320 --> 15:20.080
but better than that, guys. This is the model you want. This is the model where you get a Linux box

15:20.720 --> 15:24.800
where you can SSH into a Linux box and you actually get root access and you can control

15:24.800 --> 15:29.760
the system, right? The hyperscalers, it's all abstracted away from you with their esoteric

15:29.760 --> 15:33.600
language and their esoteric names and their esoteric interface. And God, I like saying

15:33.600 --> 15:39.760
esoteric because it's so true for those different, I don't know, I'll just call them hyperscalers.

15:39.760 --> 15:44.080
I won't start swearing, but you know how I feel about it. Like that is not the future that I

15:44.080 --> 15:48.000
want to see. I mean, I'm glad that's a product for some people, but I want Linux systems that

15:48.000 --> 15:53.280
I can get access to, I can install the packages, I can manage. That's my infrastructure and that's

15:53.280 --> 15:58.160
the model Linode is continuing to make awesome and excellent. And they're doing it with the

15:58.160 --> 16:02.800
best performance, the best support and 11 data centers for you to choose from. Go build something,

16:02.800 --> 16:07.840
go learn something, try it for yourself and support the show. That $100 really lets you try it.

16:07.840 --> 16:14.960
Linode.com slash unplugged. One more time. Go support the show and try it out. Linode.com slash

16:14.960 --> 16:23.520
unplugged. Back home baller. Damn straight y'all. Yeah, that's right. It's time for some baller

16:23.520 --> 16:32.960
boosts. First up from Tecario with 30,000 Satoshis. Cause I'm a back home baller. If I want

16:32.960 --> 16:38.240
something I just holler. A long time listener crashed your mumble server at one time with

16:38.240 --> 16:44.640
emojis. Hey, ouch. Hey now, but thanks for owning up to it anyway. Just want to say thanks for

16:44.640 --> 16:49.680
putting this together week after week. It's been a great journey and this is the one podcast I have

16:49.680 --> 16:55.360
always looked forward to for years now. Keep it real. Hey, you keep it real Tecario. We really

16:55.360 --> 17:01.520
appreciate you. Yeah, thank you TC. That's amazing. Your baller boost also helped put us on one of

17:01.520 --> 17:07.360
the top boosted lists for the Fountain.fm podcast player. So thank you very much. We didn't get a

17:07.360 --> 17:12.960
ton of boosts this week, but this definitely made up for it. So thank you very much.

17:12.960 --> 17:21.200
We got the boosts that mattered. Speaking of, here's a boost from our friend Gene Bean with 13,370

17:21.200 --> 17:28.400
Satoshis. Cause I'm a back home baller. Oh, you might be interested in this one Chris. Gene Bean

17:28.400 --> 17:33.120
writes, I think I found a good meetup.com alternative. He does know you can hit him

17:33.120 --> 17:37.520
up on matrix if you want some more details, but the short version I asked around on the

17:37.520 --> 17:44.080
Faustodon Mastodon server and got a lot of good feedback about Mobiles on. I don't know how to

17:44.080 --> 17:49.120
say that. Mobiles on and a few other services though. Mobiles on seem like the best fit for

17:49.120 --> 17:53.920
your guys possible needs. I did a little bit of time looking into this and it looks like it's a

17:53.920 --> 18:00.560
free Libre and open source software set maintained by the same folks behind PeerTube from a soft.

18:00.560 --> 18:06.080
What? Really? Oh, lovely. How do we not know about this? I wonder if it's like a play on

18:06.080 --> 18:10.400
mobilization. I think it's French. So I'm sure I A said it wrong and B we're missing

18:10.400 --> 18:17.680
several layers of nuance. Mobiles on. Oh, oh, Brent knows it. Yes, I do. I have the French tongue.

18:17.680 --> 18:21.360
I got to say I've legit never heard of this. I've heard of some of the others like get together and

18:21.360 --> 18:26.080
whatnot. Never seen this. So this is super interesting. I really appreciate that. I will

18:26.080 --> 18:30.720
definitely take a look at that. Have you guys ever heard of this one? No, but it's got it's got

18:30.720 --> 18:36.800
a nice website and yeah, it might be might be worth a look. That's great. Well, thank you very much.

18:36.800 --> 18:40.640
If you'd like to send us a boost, you can get a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com. What we're

18:40.640 --> 18:47.760
doing now is we're splitting out the the baller boosts from the regular boosts. I guess we

18:47.760 --> 18:52.160
appreciate all of them. But what we're doing is for the last half of the show towards the end of

18:52.160 --> 18:55.920
the show, we're going to pivot to just boost quality. The signal is what we'll choose for

18:55.920 --> 18:59.680
which boosts make it into the show. So we have a special spot to thank the people who are helping

18:59.680 --> 19:02.960
support the show directly with the baller boosts. And then later on in the show for the feedback

19:02.960 --> 19:08.160
section, any boost is welcome. It just has to meet a certain threshold of signal, I suppose.

19:08.160 --> 19:11.760
I don't like that. I don't want to make that sound bad, though. But I hope you get what we mean.

19:11.760 --> 19:15.760
Just trying to keep it tidy. We can only read so many. Thank you, Boost. But they mean a lot to us.

19:15.760 --> 19:19.280
We just have to edit for the show sometimes. That's basically it. We read them all and we

19:19.280 --> 19:25.520
appreciate them all. All right, guys, let's talk about Endless OS. Endless was founded in 2012 in

19:25.520 --> 19:32.720
San Francisco, California, by Matthew Dalio and Marcelo Sampeo. And then in April of 2015,

19:32.720 --> 19:38.000
it probably got on all of our radar. I know we covered it at JV when they launched a Kickstarter.

19:38.000 --> 19:43.440
They raised one hundred and seventy six thousand dollars with one thousand and forty one backers

19:43.440 --> 19:48.320
in less than 30 days. And initially, they were really going to focus on hardware. Over the years,

19:48.320 --> 19:53.120
they've pivoted more to focusing just on the software. On April 1st, 2020, Endless became

19:53.120 --> 20:00.160
a nonprofit organization known as the Endless OS Foundation. Endless is based on Debian,

20:00.160 --> 20:05.920
roughly, with a whole lot of customizations. It is an immutable OS based on OS tree

20:05.920 --> 20:11.200
and a lot of flat packs. And we wanted to kick the tires and see if this was the implementation

20:11.200 --> 20:16.560
truly designed for a workstation, for end users, maybe for family, for an office setting.

20:16.560 --> 20:22.480
Brent, why don't we start with your experience? Yeah, I was really excited to try Endless. I've

20:22.480 --> 20:28.720
heard about it for years. I think it was back in like 2018. I started poking my eyes on it and

20:28.720 --> 20:34.480
keeping track of it. And they're doing a bunch of really neat stuff around education and outreach

20:34.480 --> 20:38.880
to, you know, countries that don't have super fast Internet. So they've got a bunch of really

20:38.880 --> 20:42.480
neat features around that. So that that's what got me interested at first. And I knew,

20:43.200 --> 20:47.920
oh, I know you too. And I figured you'd focus on the technical bits. So I thought, well,

20:47.920 --> 20:53.280
I'm just going to approach this from a usability and sort of user friendliness standpoint. And

20:53.280 --> 20:58.080
I think you both know I'm pretty good at that. So things were going pretty well. I, unfortunately,

20:58.080 --> 21:05.520
though, started running into a few frustrating issues. I'm here testing Endless OS and feeling

21:05.520 --> 21:12.720
some frustrations. I really want to like Endless OS. There's some really nice stuff about it and

21:12.720 --> 21:18.320
some well thought out sections. But I'm running into some performance issues, which I never

21:18.320 --> 21:27.680
expected. I was originally running it in a virtual machine on my ThinkPad X250. And it was running

21:27.680 --> 21:33.840
kind of slow. And I thought, OK, I'm going to give it a good chance. So I pulled out my workstation

21:33.840 --> 21:40.640
and installed it on an SSD, internal SSD, because I thought, I'm going to give it the best chance

21:40.640 --> 21:49.280
possible. And I'm running into some issues. So there's, in particular, I think, a great example

21:49.280 --> 21:55.760
of how frustrating this is, is there's one of the 12 icons that appears in the launcher. It's called

21:55.760 --> 22:01.520
system, which is a little bit confusing. I thought it was going to be like system information or

22:01.520 --> 22:05.600
something like that. It ends up being, which I think is also great, ends up being a teaching

22:05.600 --> 22:14.880
tool for computer internals. And it's graphically cartoony and looks kind of fun. But it just brings

22:14.880 --> 22:20.960
the entire system to a halt. The graphics are super glitchy. Whenever you move the mouse,

22:20.960 --> 22:28.320
one of the cores on my CPU, which has six, it's not a slouch of a computer. I guess it's an AMD

22:28.320 --> 22:36.400
Phenom 21075T. Graphics are AMD RS 880. So it's an old thing. It's got eight gigs of RAM. It's an

22:36.400 --> 22:43.200
old thing, but not a slouch by any means. And one of the processors just get pegged whenever you

22:43.920 --> 22:47.520
have this thing open and you're scrolling your mouse around it. But it also just

22:48.560 --> 22:53.280
brings the entire system to a halt, to the point where it feels like I'm running this

22:53.280 --> 23:02.880
on a Raspberry Pi or something. And that is so frustrating. It is like the slowest experience

23:02.880 --> 23:09.040
that I've had in a long time. And maybe it's just that application, but it seems like the whole

23:09.040 --> 23:15.040
system just, oh, comes to a halt. Just wasn't performing the way you wanted there, eh, Brent?

23:15.040 --> 23:20.000
Yeah. And to be fair, I think it was that particular application that was causing

23:20.000 --> 23:26.160
that issue. Unfortunately, it was the very first icon I clicked on when I, when I booted

23:26.160 --> 23:30.240
endless for the first time. So, uh, because I thought, oh, that looks interesting.

23:30.800 --> 23:35.280
Yeah, I did. I did pretty similar too. And it, it just kills the performance. It's just,

23:35.280 --> 23:40.480
yeah. Yeah. And I don't know why that is because they have another application called hack, which is

23:41.280 --> 23:47.120
a teaching tool for coding. And it's, it has a very similar feel to it in terms of like the graphics,

23:47.120 --> 23:53.040
uh, that are presented as a user interface. And yet it seemed to perform perfectly. So there,

23:53.040 --> 23:56.720
there's gotta be something there and maybe it's fairly trivial for them to address that.

23:57.280 --> 24:02.640
And I don't think it's necessarily a perfect representation of the rest of the experience,

24:02.640 --> 24:07.520
but I have to say it took, it took the whole experience down several notches for me because I

24:07.520 --> 24:12.400
just, well, it just, it just wasn't great. But there were some other things that I really loved

24:12.400 --> 24:18.160
like, um, the login screen was super simplistic, but had a ton of accessibility options, like more

24:18.160 --> 24:23.760
than I even knew existed, which I think maybe considering their audience, uh, they're trying

24:23.760 --> 24:28.160
to make it as inclusive as possible. So that was really cool to see, but I did run into a bunch of

24:28.160 --> 24:32.160
other paper cuts and I'll, I'll be curious to hear your experiences. Like, you know, my internet

24:32.160 --> 24:37.760
isn't very fast here in my little cabin. Yes, I'm back home everyone. Hello, Canada. So I thought,

24:37.760 --> 24:43.600
okay, I'm going to try their metered selecting my wifi as a metered connection. I just thought,

24:43.600 --> 24:48.960
well, see what happens. And I got some weird things happening. Like one of the, one of the

24:48.960 --> 24:53.120
things that happened in the software updater was that it suggested it was downloading the newer

24:53.120 --> 24:58.000
version of endless OS. Uh, the installer I had was a little bit of an outdated version. So it

24:58.000 --> 25:03.360
suggested it was downloading, but it never would, nor could I cancel it and nor could I kick it off,

25:03.360 --> 25:08.160
you know, on purpose. And so that was my intention with using the metered connection was like, well,

25:08.160 --> 25:13.920
I don't want things to download in the background because I have some productivity that I want to

25:13.920 --> 25:19.600
get done and downloading huge ISOs or whatever sometimes can take an hour or two here. I'm sure

25:19.600 --> 25:24.480
that's an easy fix as well, but was just another one of those. Oh, it's not quite where I want it

25:24.480 --> 25:29.760
to be. And I ran into something similar to with just trying to set a shortcut key for the terminal.

25:29.760 --> 25:35.280
I was just looking to set a keyboard shortcut and, you know, it acts asks for what the terminal

25:35.280 --> 25:40.640
application name is that you want to run. And so I right clicked on the terminal and went,

25:40.640 --> 25:45.680
Oh, which terminal is this? And, uh, it opened up the software center and just says, Oh, sorry,

25:45.680 --> 25:50.880
there's no details for this application. So there was a bunch of these little things that just

25:50.880 --> 25:55.440
started getting to me. No dark mode. I know, I know it's an old gnome version and I'm sure there's

25:55.440 --> 26:00.720
a, uh, an add on, uh, that I can do to get a dark mode. But that was, uh, hopefully they

26:00.720 --> 26:07.200
get that with a newer version of, of gnome when, when they update that. So I think I didn't ever

26:07.200 --> 26:12.320
run into any issues with the underlying OS and the technologies there and updating when I did

26:12.320 --> 26:19.040
happen was super smooth and most of the interface was exactly as you expect. But I, in the end,

26:19.040 --> 26:24.080
found all these little tiny paper cuts just kind of deflated my excitement to try it out,

26:24.080 --> 26:30.240
which I feel is very unfortunate. And I hope maybe in a year or so, maybe that'll be a little

26:30.240 --> 26:35.760
bit different, but I'm curious to hear, uh, what you thought, Chris. So I came at it from a,

26:35.760 --> 26:42.640
could this work for my kids standpoint? Because I like the idea of an immutable distro for the kids.

26:43.520 --> 26:49.280
Just the other day, some updates installed on Fedora 36, and now I'm having trouble getting

26:49.280 --> 26:55.200
Dylan's Nvidia card to work at all. Oh boy. Like the system, it sees it when I LSPCI and

26:55.200 --> 27:00.000
it's clearly there, but then like nothing I can do now to get the driver to actually work is

27:00.000 --> 27:04.080
happening. And I just think to myself like, well, the primary job of this computer is to play games

27:04.080 --> 27:08.720
for him really. And it'd be nice if I could just have rolled that back. And so an immutable system

27:08.720 --> 27:13.920
does seem really appealing. And I don't think a lot of the stuff that you hit would really bother

27:13.920 --> 27:18.000
him to be honest with you, it would bother my son, Dylan. I think most of that, it would probably

27:18.000 --> 27:22.640
be unnoticed by him. But as I was setting it up, there were a few things I observed that I just

27:22.640 --> 27:25.760
thought were kind of interesting. Like, uh, and I know you saw this one too, but just like one of

27:25.760 --> 27:30.800
the absolutely most unique EULAs I have ever seen in a Linux distro. I don't think the last one's

27:30.800 --> 27:36.000
the last time we commented on the EULA, right? It's true. Yeah. Right. I did read it. I think

27:36.000 --> 27:40.400
you spent half your time with endless just stuck in the EULA Brent. If, uh, if your Slack messages

27:40.400 --> 27:45.600
to me were any cute, that's endless EULA. Yeah. Well, they have like sections highlighted and

27:45.600 --> 27:48.720
stuff like, make sure you see this. I'm like, okay, that's wow. They're really drawing your

27:48.720 --> 27:54.160
attention. And it seems like it's a PDF embedded into the installer too. Yeah. I had a hard time

27:54.160 --> 27:59.200
reading it actually on, on the monitors that I have here, just the way it was scaling the PDF

27:59.200 --> 28:03.840
and then it would bound it as well. So I couldn't zoom in enough to really get it legible in a way

28:03.840 --> 28:09.600
that I was, I wanted it was so it could use a bit of work, I think. But you did click agree,

28:09.600 --> 28:14.160
right? Just so we know if you've, uh, yeah, I read it, I read it first and then, uh,

28:14.160 --> 28:19.200
I read it first and then the three of us had about 30 minutes of conversation back and forth

28:19.200 --> 28:24.560
about it. And then I hit accept. Yeah, we did. We did discuss it quite a bit. Uh, I actually like

28:24.560 --> 28:29.920
the way they've done the primary icons for launcher. It has a very iPad OS kind of feel,

28:29.920 --> 28:35.040
including the folders in which icons, uh, hide out in. So unlike most distros, which are turning

28:35.040 --> 28:40.640
off desktop icons these days, endless comes with hack, which is what Brent was talking about in

28:40.640 --> 28:45.280
sidetrack, which are those interesting heavy apps. And it comes with chromium as its default browser

28:46.080 --> 28:50.080
and an app center and rhythm box, you know, shot well video, bunch of stuff, right? But it's on

28:50.080 --> 28:54.080
the desktop, like spring pad or whatever springboard, they call it on iOS. It looks

28:54.080 --> 28:58.480
like that. And then of course there is more applications installed and it has a launch bar.

28:58.480 --> 29:03.680
It, and as a search to run your thing. So if you want, you can just, and it's a search and enter

29:03.680 --> 29:09.200
to launch kind of thing. And I think all of that would work really, really well for most new users.

29:09.200 --> 29:14.960
In fact, I would argue that's probably for, for new users or average users. That's probably the

29:14.960 --> 29:19.760
most accessible desktop launcher setup I've seen in a long time. I think they nailed that. And I

29:19.760 --> 29:24.960
don't think it's how most like a pro Linux users like it. It's clearly not how upstream GNOME does

29:24.960 --> 29:29.520
things, which is interesting considering endless's relationship with GNOME, which we'll get to more,

29:29.520 --> 29:34.080
but yet it's how they're doing things. I think the technological appeal to endless OS

29:34.080 --> 29:39.840
is OS tree. Also they integrate flat packs at a level deeper than I've seen any other distribution.

29:39.840 --> 29:45.120
Like when the system's booting up and you clear the splash screen and you just look at the services

29:45.120 --> 29:50.160
starting, you'll see a ton of stuff is actually flat pack stuff, even at the lower level of the

29:50.160 --> 29:53.840
system. I've never seen it integrated that low before. I'll talk about that more with Cassidy.

29:54.480 --> 30:00.640
And it's hard to mess up because of all of these things, because of the flat pack and because of

30:00.640 --> 30:05.440
the immutable nature. It also means that if it's not right, it's harder to tweak it to make it right.

30:06.160 --> 30:12.160
But if it's working out of the box and it works for you, it'll pretty much stay that way. That is

30:12.160 --> 30:16.720
really nice. I think the number one thing I hate is when I give a family member Linux and then they

30:16.720 --> 30:23.360
come back to me in about three months and something broke. And I just find that intolerable. And so

30:23.360 --> 30:28.720
I think this would prevent those kinds of things. And then ultimately it's easy to use.

30:28.720 --> 30:33.840
It's obvious. I think anyone who has any familiarity with a computer at all could use

30:33.840 --> 30:40.640
Endless OS. And not all distributions strike that balance. So I don't know if I love it. I think

30:40.640 --> 30:47.840
I prefer seeing what GNOME's doing now. I want the newer stuff now. I already want GNOME 43, right?

30:47.840 --> 30:53.840
So Endless just isn't really a distribution for me. But I don't think Dylan cares what version of

30:53.840 --> 30:58.640
GNOME he gets as long as files works, as long as he can use the system. He doesn't care what version

30:58.640 --> 31:02.560
of GNOME it is. He just wants it to be nice. He wants it to look modern. He wants it to be nice.

31:02.560 --> 31:06.720
He sees dad set up and he wants it to look cool like dad set up. So dark mode would be helpful.

31:06.720 --> 31:11.440
What about you, Wes? A few things stand out from what you guys said. One, yeah, the flat pack

31:11.440 --> 31:17.600
implementation is just really nice. And that, to me, it led me down this train of thought here of

31:17.600 --> 31:22.960
I can't really think of the last time I saw a Linux distribution that felt this productized,

31:22.960 --> 31:28.160
and not in a bad way, just like very thoughtfully designed, clearly that these elements have been

31:28.160 --> 31:32.800
selected and worked on and honed over the long number of years now that Endless has been around

31:32.800 --> 31:38.320
to try to get this experience. I think maybe there's some questions around if that's really

31:38.320 --> 31:43.440
the experience like you and I and Brent want for our systems because we're so used to sort of

31:43.440 --> 31:47.680
taking all these bits, especially with something, you know, talking of immutability playing with

31:47.680 --> 31:53.200
with Nix, where we're building our own custom systems from whole cloth, basically. Endless is

31:53.200 --> 31:57.840
kind of on the opposite end of the spectrum. But what they've done is it's just really impressive.

31:57.840 --> 32:01.680
And like you're talking about, you know, Dylan, I'm thinking kind of the reverse here. I'm thinking

32:01.680 --> 32:07.840
my mom, you know, she's on a older 1804, 20 or four, either way, I need to do some updates,

32:07.840 --> 32:14.080
a Monte system. I think I might just try Endless next for her. I could see that being a pretty

32:14.080 --> 32:20.480
trouble free OS in that situation. I did find it a little funny to get started with. I do want to

32:20.480 --> 32:24.480
give them a lot of credit for having a lot of different images available. I really enjoyed that

32:24.480 --> 32:28.960
they had like a VMDK image. If you just want to try it out in a virtual machine, no fuss. They've

32:28.960 --> 32:34.240
got Raspberry Pi, they've got pine stuff. They've got like a lot of different ARM versions. But

32:34.240 --> 32:38.240
that also means you have a ton of different things to pick from. And you're like, well,

32:38.240 --> 32:42.640
do I want this multi language? And like, they've got these minimal base versions, but then he's

32:42.640 --> 32:48.000
also really fat, like 16 gig downloads if you want all the stuff baked in. But unless you spend

32:48.000 --> 32:51.840
enough time sort of reading all the verbiage to understand what those options are and mean,

32:52.400 --> 32:56.400
I don't know, I could I could see not getting the image I want. And then I was also just a

32:56.400 --> 33:01.200
little surprised that you end up getting a dot torrent file instead of your ISO or

33:01.200 --> 33:07.840
IMG. Yeah, I'm fine with that. I'm fine with that. But is the average endless user fine with that?

33:07.840 --> 33:12.080
I don't know. I don't want to presume. But that's the end. That's where I have some questions. I'd

33:12.080 --> 33:16.720
be I'd be real curious to learn more because on one hand, torrent files are kind of, you know,

33:16.720 --> 33:21.520
kind of arcane if you're not a if you're not a nerd, downloading a lot of ISOs or other content.

33:21.520 --> 33:24.960
But at the same time, you could see where you know, some of the use cases that endless is trying

33:24.960 --> 33:29.200
to fit here. Maybe you don't have access to fancy CDNs, but you could see where you could

33:29.200 --> 33:33.280
maybe you don't have access to fancy CDNs. But you do have a local community or a local school

33:33.280 --> 33:38.000
or few organizations in a country that have these distributed. And that's where something like

33:38.000 --> 33:41.360
torrents might really shine. Yeah, I could also see though, in school networks torrents being

33:41.360 --> 33:46.240
totally blocked. You know, you just in a university, I could see them blocking torrent downloads.

33:46.240 --> 33:50.880
You know, West to add to your confusion, I found that there were certain downloads of a certain

33:50.880 --> 33:59.520
version of endless os at endless os.com. And then there were a few places at endless os.org, where

33:59.520 --> 34:07.280
I think more of the development happens where I found more updated versions like 4.0 dot eight,

34:07.280 --> 34:12.880
I think it is is the most recent and I was a little confused. I guess on the homepage, maybe

34:12.880 --> 34:18.320
that's their like super stable, you know, 4.0 release. And that's what they're putting out

34:18.320 --> 34:23.040
there. But if you I was trying to get the latest and greatest version, and I, I found like three

34:23.040 --> 34:27.680
different places to get different versions that I thought was a little bit confusing. And the one

34:27.680 --> 34:32.960
that they put it endless.org, they actually lead with a Windows installer version. Oh, that's

34:32.960 --> 34:37.280
fascinating. Yeah, there's a lot more to play with here. I gotta say like, I don't think I've

34:37.280 --> 34:40.880
finished my playing around with endless OS. I mean, as you say, right, they've got this whole

34:40.880 --> 34:45.040
option to like, just install it alongside Windows, I definitely the next time I'm feeling up to

34:45.040 --> 34:49.040
actually doing a fresh Windows install, I'd like to try that alongside. And then as you mentioned,

34:49.040 --> 34:53.280
like they've got Raspberry Pi support. And I just I just want to see how that hangs together.

34:53.280 --> 34:58.720
Yeah, it is it makes for a confusing set of download options. But I guess, you know, it's nice

34:58.720 --> 35:05.600
to have those options. So either way, for an enthusiast, it's fine. I wonder how the cycle

35:05.600 --> 35:10.400
for users are most endless users, you know, sort of setting this up for themselves? Or is it

35:10.400 --> 35:15.120
something, you know, more institutional, where, you know, someone can get these ISO files on the

35:15.120 --> 35:18.000
back end, maybe they're not even a computer expert, but they know enough to sort of get these

35:18.000 --> 35:21.760
files going and start flashing laptops with them and hand them out? Because it seems like once you

35:21.760 --> 35:25.760
get past that first phase, then yeah, I think we've all kind of thought like, Oh, yeah, I'm not

35:25.760 --> 35:29.440
gonna be able to break this very easily. Or at least, you know, less knowledgeable Linux users

35:29.440 --> 35:34.560
certainly won't. I think our buddy Cass will speak to that a bit. But I got a I got a vague sense

35:34.560 --> 35:40.160
when talking to him kind of like, where their market is now for that kind of thing. And I think

35:40.160 --> 35:43.600
it's probably a lot of pre installed, like somebody else's installing it for them. Yeah,

35:43.600 --> 35:48.400
that makes sense. And, you know, really here, we're not experts, we're just kind of dabbling,

35:48.400 --> 35:52.640
we've done our whole summer of immutability. Endless is a fascinating, totally different

35:52.640 --> 35:57.920
approach. And I think it also speaks to sort of the usefulness of tools like OS tree and where

35:57.920 --> 36:03.040
those technologies are going. But we wanted, you know, we wanted more details. And thankfully,

36:03.760 --> 36:08.320
our dear friend of the show, Cassidy James Blady was willing to sit down earlier this week with

36:08.320 --> 36:13.520
Chris. He's now working at Endless, and had a bunch of insights to share with us.

36:14.080 --> 36:17.920
So a big welcome back to the show, Cassidy. It has been too long. I think the last time you

36:17.920 --> 36:22.880
and I chatted might have been in person at system 76 last year. Yeah, yeah, it's been a minute.

36:22.880 --> 36:27.040
A lot has changed for you since then. So I know you're now over at Endless,

36:27.040 --> 36:31.040
I think probably last time you're on the show, you're still at elementary. Yeah. So tell us

36:31.040 --> 36:34.160
what you do at Endless and what your title is over there and all that jazz.

36:34.160 --> 36:39.760
At Endless, I'm the partner success engineer. And basically my job, it's funny because it's kind of

36:39.760 --> 36:45.040
this almost, what's the word, amorphous job description. But it's basically like,

36:45.840 --> 36:52.160
make sure that our partners are successful and whatever is needed there. And practically,

36:52.160 --> 36:56.800
what that means is I'm a bridge between the engineering team and partner organizations.

36:56.800 --> 37:02.400
So there's like other nonprofits, non-governmental organizations, sometimes governments that are

37:02.400 --> 37:08.880
deploying Endless OS in various places around the world. And I help make that happen.

37:09.440 --> 37:13.040
Interesting. Those sound like some pretty heavy hitter clients. It's interesting too,

37:13.040 --> 37:18.560
because knowing what I know about you and your style and your tastes, I think it seems like

37:18.560 --> 37:24.080
Endless is a really good fit because Endless OS itself is one of the most polished Linux

37:24.080 --> 37:29.680
distributions that I've ever used. And there's a lot that goes into making a distribution this

37:29.680 --> 37:35.520
nice, this well put together and this accessible to end users. But yet, I wonder if you agree,

37:35.520 --> 37:39.120
because I know you've been around for a minute in the Linux community. It really doesn't feel like

37:39.120 --> 37:44.160
many people are talking about Endless. Why do you suppose it doesn't quite get the attention,

37:44.160 --> 37:48.240
maybe say a Mint or another distribution that's really desktop focused out there?

37:48.800 --> 37:55.600
Yeah. Well, it's funny. It definitely is kind of a sleeper OS in a way, as far as within

37:55.600 --> 38:01.520
the Linux community. And I think a big part of that is because the Linux community,

38:01.520 --> 38:06.960
shocker, is not really the target audience of Endless OS. And that's fine. And that's

38:06.960 --> 38:13.120
actually pretty cool. The target for Endless OS is these partner organizations and people around

38:13.120 --> 38:19.440
the world who need a simple computer. And a lot of times there's a heavy education focus. We work

38:19.440 --> 38:25.840
with educational institutions like schools or school districts, and they'll deploy this in a

38:25.840 --> 38:31.920
school for kids who have only ever used a smartphone as their computer. And so this is

38:31.920 --> 38:37.760
their first computer, their first real computer. That's a very different audience from what I think

38:37.760 --> 38:46.640
most people using Linux Mint or Fedora or whatever are going to be. And that speaks to the diversity

38:46.640 --> 38:51.600
of open source and why I think it's cool. You get a lot of flack sometimes. People say,

38:51.600 --> 38:55.840
oh, why don't all the distros come together and make one super distro? That's recurring,

38:55.840 --> 38:59.520
almost like a meme at this point, right? It's like, why can't we all just make one desktop

38:59.520 --> 39:06.320
environment, one distro, one OS? And while sometimes I do think companies venture out on

39:06.320 --> 39:11.840
their own a little too much and don't kind of work with the rest of the community, I think there's

39:11.840 --> 39:17.280
also a place for that. I think there's a place for, we have a target market. We have, I mean,

39:17.280 --> 39:21.040
at Endless, we have a decade of experience working with these organizations and these

39:21.040 --> 39:26.080
deployments around the world. A lot of times it's places with really low power computers

39:26.080 --> 39:32.960
with little or no internet or very expensive internet. These are very different users than,

39:32.960 --> 39:38.720
say, a developer running Ubuntu. I think sometimes there's a place for that, for different

39:38.720 --> 39:44.400
solutions for different people. It strikes me, though, that there's a bit of a dichotomy with

39:44.400 --> 39:48.640
this distribution because I think you just really did a really good job defining who the target

39:48.640 --> 39:54.720
user is. But yet, my early investigations into this, it feels like it's built on a lot of advanced

39:54.720 --> 39:59.280
technologies. I feel like I see Flatpaks Incorporated way lower in the system than I've

39:59.280 --> 40:02.800
seen other distributions incorporate Flatpaks. Can you talk about that a little bit?

40:02.800 --> 40:08.160
And I'm actually not super clear on the origin origins of this. Rob McQueen, our CEO, would

40:08.160 --> 40:13.920
actually be the person to dive into the real interesting history here with Collabra and

40:13.920 --> 40:20.720
Lanaro. There was some, the origins of Endless OS comes out of that somehow somewhere. Basically,

40:20.720 --> 40:27.360
it was the first or one of the first image-based Linux operating systems. So we use OS Tree for

40:27.360 --> 40:35.360
the operating system at a low level. The whole OS is an OS Tree image and updates come through as

40:35.360 --> 40:40.240
like a diff commits almost like Git. If you're familiar with OS Tree, it's like Git for operating

40:40.240 --> 40:44.960
systems. It's actually the same technology that Flatpak uses under the hood. So the whole operating

40:44.960 --> 40:52.400
system's an image and you get updates to it. And then the natural solution for apps on top of that

40:52.400 --> 40:57.360
is Flatpak. Again, similar technology or same technologies under the hood. The biggest thing for

40:57.360 --> 41:06.720
us is it has to be bulletproof. It has to just work really well and updates over extremely slow,

41:06.720 --> 41:11.920
extremely expensive data connections. Updates have to come down and they have to be diffs

41:11.920 --> 41:17.280
of the OS. You can't download an entire 100 gigabyte or more image with all the educational

41:17.280 --> 41:22.560
content especially. And you can't download it halfway and then have it fail and download it

41:22.560 --> 41:28.720
again because you're paying per bit. So it has to be bulletproof. On the other side of the keyboard,

41:28.720 --> 41:34.800
on the user side of the keyboard, you have somebody who can't debug it, whether it's a kid

41:34.800 --> 41:41.680
at a school or maybe an administrator, a teacher or an administrator at a school who is not an IT

41:41.680 --> 41:47.440
person. The school may not even have an IT department. It's like, it just has to work. It

41:47.440 --> 41:54.080
has to work really well. And so that's really the reasons we use OS3 image-based and Flatpak is. We

41:54.080 --> 41:59.600
can't have package conflicts. We can't have any of that legacy issues that you might have had in

41:59.600 --> 42:04.160
the past on Linux. You know, we've been spending the summer looking at immutable Linux distributions

42:04.160 --> 42:10.480
and Endless feels like the absolute peak implementation where maybe even at first

42:10.480 --> 42:14.720
pass, if you downloaded this and just use it, you wouldn't realize that it's an image-based OS

42:14.720 --> 42:20.240
at all. That's fascinating. And I imagine to pull that off, to integrate Flatpaks like they have,

42:20.960 --> 42:26.560
all of this, there must be a lot of upstream collaboration with the GNOME project and GTK.

42:26.560 --> 42:30.480
And I think this is an area where Endless is probably heavily involved and again,

42:31.040 --> 42:34.720
doesn't get very much attention. Yeah. I love this. Like what I talked to friends about,

42:34.720 --> 42:38.240
they're like, Oh, Endless, I've kind of heard you guys, like heard about you guys. Like,

42:38.240 --> 42:44.000
what do you do? I'm like, well, do you use GNOME software? Do you use Flatpak? Have you ever used

42:44.000 --> 42:49.360
Flathub? Have you ever used the Power Profiles work? Have you ever done anything with Metered

42:49.360 --> 42:53.840
Data? Have you ever, like, if you've done any of that stuff, you've used our software and because

42:53.840 --> 42:59.600
we've written it upstream. Even if you've like gone super wild experimental developer, like if

42:59.600 --> 43:05.280
you're testing GNOME OS, which is like the open secret GNOME operating system, that's, you know,

43:05.280 --> 43:10.880
just for CI or just, just for testing in CI, not on real hardware, that uses the Endless installer

43:10.880 --> 43:15.520
as its installer. Like we contributed that upstream to GNOME. Much of the work going into

43:15.520 --> 43:18.480
GNOME these days, I don't want to take credit for everything. Like obviously there's so many people

43:18.480 --> 43:23.200
and there's such a diversity of people involved in GNOME, but like much of the work that you don't

43:23.200 --> 43:29.440
realize in the GNOME community and the Flatpak community is done by Endless people. I find that

43:29.440 --> 43:35.600
absolutely fascinating. And of course, users get the benefit on all of the distributions, but

43:36.240 --> 43:42.080
it creates this interesting situation where, yeah, Endless isn't necessarily shipping the latest

43:42.080 --> 43:47.440
GNOME base. It's like what, 3.38 or something like that base still, you know, and of course,

43:47.440 --> 43:53.520
GNOME 42 is out and they're working on 43, but yet a lot of the features I'm now enjoying in

43:53.520 --> 43:58.320
current versions of GNOME are actually here in Endless already. Yeah, yeah. The Metered Data is

43:58.320 --> 44:03.760
a big example of that. And it was years ago, I went to a hack fest in, I think it was in London

44:03.760 --> 44:08.480
at Red Hat office with a bunch of GNOME people. And I was there, like I was half representing

44:08.480 --> 44:12.080
elementary and half representing System76. Like this is the beauty of open source and all the

44:12.080 --> 44:17.360
companies and organizations involved in open source is like, I'm still involved with the exact

44:17.360 --> 44:22.000
same people as when I was working at System76, doing elementary in my free time, and now I'm

44:22.000 --> 44:28.400
working at Endless. But yeah, the focus of that hack fest was Metered Data and Parental Controls.

44:28.400 --> 44:32.240
And those were two features that didn't exist in GNOME and weren't standardized in any way.

44:32.960 --> 44:39.440
They existed in Endless OS downstream and we, Endless sent people to like,

44:40.080 --> 44:44.080
hey, how do we design it in a way that not just works for us and our use cases, we know

44:44.080 --> 44:51.200
we have weird use cases for our weird users, you know, compared to the broader Linux community,

44:51.200 --> 44:54.960
but how do we actually do it the right way upstream? And so now that's why Parental

44:54.960 --> 45:01.440
Controls is built in. There's a, what's it called? Malkontent, which is a great name for a library.

45:01.440 --> 45:06.960
It's a library for implementing like parental controls and content aware. And it piggybacks

45:06.960 --> 45:14.560
on the Flatpak and AppStream data. So like you can restrict your apps that are open based on like

45:14.560 --> 45:18.960
what kind of contents they have. Like there's all these efforts that like we've been kind of had our

45:18.960 --> 45:23.600
fingers in that really make for a really good experience for any general purpose operating

45:23.600 --> 45:28.880
system as well. Yeah. And it makes it safe as a family machine, desktop OS. And that's nice.

45:28.880 --> 45:33.360
And not one you have to tinker with. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. We hear a lot of people who are like,

45:33.360 --> 45:36.560
Hey, I heard this Endless OS thing. Like I'm a developer. It doesn't really make sense for me,

45:36.560 --> 45:41.120
which first of all, that's side note. Like I do a lot of development and I use Endless OS,

45:41.120 --> 45:46.480
but I get it. Like maybe, maybe an Ubuntu or Fedora install or something is better for you.

45:46.480 --> 45:51.520
And that's fine. But like, we'll hear from these people. But I bought a laptop for my kid and I

45:51.520 --> 45:55.440
threw Endless OS on it and I just don't have to worry. And it's like, yes, exactly. You don't have

45:55.440 --> 46:00.640
to be an IT person to run it. You don't have to like worry about the content because it has parental

46:00.640 --> 46:06.480
controls built in and it's proven by tens of thousands of active users out there around the

46:06.480 --> 46:12.000
world of like different cultures and different deployments in different countries. So it's a

46:12.000 --> 46:17.760
pretty safe bet. It's maybe one of the lesser known out there, but it should probably get more

46:17.760 --> 46:22.240
attention. I hear from listeners all the time who say, well, I ended up getting a Mac or I switched

46:22.240 --> 46:26.080
to Windows for a bit. I just got too frustrated. And my thought was, is always like, well, you

46:26.080 --> 46:29.600
should try something like Endless because you still get to use Linux, you get that environment,

46:29.600 --> 46:35.120
but you've got that bulletproof image base, flat packs for the applications. As we kind of

46:35.760 --> 46:41.760
wrap up this little summer journey into immutable Linux, I wonder if you agree that it's going to

46:41.760 --> 46:48.720
take a long time, but I could see in five to 10 years, your average users that are getting Linux

46:48.720 --> 46:52.800
systems, maybe they're shipped from a manufacturer for office work and enterprise work and school

46:52.800 --> 46:57.440
work. Doesn't it seem like just the trend is going to be all of those are inevitably going to be

46:58.160 --> 47:04.000
immutable based systems, image based systems in some way just because of the problems that solves

47:04.000 --> 47:09.360
for everyday users? It seems inevitable to me. What about to you? Yeah, absolutely. I'm actually

47:09.360 --> 47:15.520
more surprised that it's not already happening sooner, if that makes sense. I've been using

47:15.520 --> 47:23.120
Silverblue off and on. For a while, it was my way to see what Gnome was up to before I was as deeply

47:23.120 --> 47:27.360
involved in the Gnome community, because I just knew I don't really want to fiddle with, honestly,

47:27.360 --> 47:31.120
it was like for me, I wasn't used to Fedora package management. And so I was like, if I just

47:31.120 --> 47:36.080
I can't do Fedora package management with Silverblue, I knew there's RPM, OS3 and stuff.

47:36.080 --> 47:43.280
So that was the reason I started on Silverblue and I think it was on Fedora 34. And then that

47:43.280 --> 47:49.840
install, I upgraded to 35 and 36. I upgraded to the alpha of 36 and rolled back to 35. And that

47:49.840 --> 47:58.080
was flawless. That's what sold me and what blew my mind was like, oh, this is just the way it should

47:58.080 --> 48:03.200
be. This is just the right way to do it. And I think all the right people, all the important

48:03.200 --> 48:10.080
people working on things know that. I think the hurdles we have to get over is like developer

48:10.080 --> 48:15.680
tooling, which I'll say with like with Toolbox and Flatpak Builder and stuff, the developer

48:15.680 --> 48:19.600
experience is actually really good, too. I'm still kind of getting used to doing everything

48:19.600 --> 48:25.920
in a toolbox, but it's really nice to have that separation between your host OS and your

48:25.920 --> 48:31.760
development environment. It's a sound concept. Maybe here's my hot take. I would be shocked if

48:31.760 --> 48:37.280
Fedora doesn't switch to Silverblue as the default within the next three years, maybe.

48:39.040 --> 48:41.360
I was going to say five, but I was like, let's be aggressive.

48:41.360 --> 48:46.240
Yeah, five was my bet. So three is a little aggressive, but it's wild and I feel like I've

48:46.240 --> 48:52.720
had a blind spot on all of this really until about April and then June of this year when I really

48:52.720 --> 48:56.400
started paying attention at the beginning of summer. It's just funny because you look at it

48:56.400 --> 48:59.920
and after you've used it for a bit, you're like, oh, well, clearly this is the way it's going.

48:59.920 --> 49:08.320
So it solves so many problems. I was talking with the GNOME design team last week and they're

49:08.320 --> 49:13.200
working on some new features in GNOME software, some new designs, and it's like, you know,

49:13.200 --> 49:17.040
this would just be so much easier if we didn't have to worry about devs and RPMs

49:17.760 --> 49:24.320
and if it was just images for the OS and Flatpaks for the apps. And honestly, that's how I have

49:24.320 --> 49:28.560
Silverblue. That's how Endless OS is set up. It really is nice once you kind of just accept

49:28.560 --> 49:33.840
that's how it works. It's real nice. Yeah, you get that workflow and it functions really good.

49:33.840 --> 49:39.680
It's really solid. You have modern applications. You're not stuck to just what's in the repo

49:39.680 --> 49:44.800
and you have that bulletproof reliability. It's such a win. Well, Cassie, it's been really fun

49:44.800 --> 49:49.520
to dig into this. Endless looks like just a beautiful OS. It's just a really great piece

49:49.520 --> 49:54.240
of work and stay in touch. Thanks for coming on and chatting with me and keep up the great work.

49:54.240 --> 50:02.640
Sounds good. Thank you. Bitwarden.com slash Linux. Get started with a free trial for yourself

50:02.640 --> 50:08.720
or a team or an enterprise at Bitwarden.com slash Linux. I started as an individual user and now I

50:08.720 --> 50:13.600
use it for my business and Bitwarden makes it really simple all along the way to just have

50:13.600 --> 50:18.400
really great password and security hygiene and store your secrets in a safe place. I imported

50:18.400 --> 50:23.280
from my old password manager years ago and then it was also very simple for others on our team

50:23.280 --> 50:27.520
to import from their password managers and now we can all work collaboratively. And as a team,

50:28.160 --> 50:32.880
we use that daily. But as a business owner, I take some security in knowing that Bitwarden

50:32.880 --> 50:37.600
is open source and it's trusted by millions of individuals in their community. Wes and I use it

50:37.600 --> 50:41.920
every single day personally and for our work stuff. And Bitwarden has been adding features

50:41.920 --> 50:47.600
at an incredible clip. New stuff all the time, like cross domain identity management, of course,

50:47.600 --> 50:53.360
username generator, which I think is just brilliant. And they've worked with email relay

50:53.360 --> 50:58.960
services. So you could actually even give a unique email, a unique username and a unique password

50:59.600 --> 51:04.320
for every site or service you use. And Bitwarden is the only way I think it's reasonable to stay

51:04.320 --> 51:08.800
secure across mobile and desktop devices. And of course, they have a flat pack app. So it's one of

51:08.800 --> 51:12.720
the very first things I install so I can start authenticating everything because like everything

51:12.720 --> 51:16.960
needs a log in these days. And then, of course, I also have to log in on my mobile device.

51:16.960 --> 51:21.760
And like, am I going to have like this crazy three or four sentence long password that I type in

51:21.760 --> 51:26.480
manually every single time? Of course not. Of course not. And Bitwarden is the best way to

51:26.480 --> 51:30.400
manage that. And it's all your secrets. And you can also put your two factor tokens in there,

51:30.400 --> 51:34.960
which is really convenient. And they make it really simple to manage your personal stuff

51:34.960 --> 51:38.800
and your business stuff. I can attest to that. You can keep them separated, but easily switch

51:38.800 --> 51:43.760
between them. On top of all of that, you can get ease of mind with their vault health reports.

51:43.760 --> 51:47.200
It's so great bringing it all together. And then when you add the new features,

51:47.200 --> 51:53.120
just the really smart stuff that they've been like laser accurately adding to Bitwarden.

51:53.920 --> 51:57.520
Oh, it's such a great time to become a Bitwarden user. If maybe you've already done it. You know,

51:57.520 --> 52:01.040
I'd be surprised if you haven't because it is really self-evident. So if you have,

52:01.040 --> 52:04.640
maybe you could suggest this to someone else. It's a great way to support the show as well.

52:04.640 --> 52:09.520
Maybe your workplace could use this. We all have a friend or a family member that could probably

52:09.520 --> 52:14.800
do passwords better, better than the sticky under their keyboard. I won't name names,

52:14.800 --> 52:18.480
but I have more than one family member that used to do it that way. I gave the gift of Bitwarden.

52:18.480 --> 52:23.360
You can too. Bitwarden.com slash Linux. One more time to go get it for yourself

52:23.360 --> 52:27.920
or for a team. Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

52:31.440 --> 52:34.720
As always, we got some great feedback this week. If you want to send us some,

52:34.720 --> 52:41.200
you can go to Linux Unplugged dot com slash contact. Former Gentour sent two ideas I think

52:41.200 --> 52:47.440
were worthy of discussion. The first is just a little feedback on Tailscale. They say,

52:48.000 --> 52:53.040
Hey, wonderful team. I've been listening to y'all for a year now, and I'm eternally grateful for

52:53.040 --> 52:57.840
Tailscale, which I learned about from you and which I've been using to roll out my own VPN

52:57.840 --> 53:02.960
for the family. We're spread out through three continents. I take a good look at every single

53:02.960 --> 53:08.160
one of your software recommendations. Thank you. Isn't that nice? That is nice. That is nice.

53:08.160 --> 53:11.600
We can take full credit for Tailscale. You know, I think the team over there did some of the work

53:11.600 --> 53:16.160
too. We just are standing on the shoulders of giants with Tailscale. We have the easy job of

53:16.160 --> 53:21.760
just being fans. I do like it a lot. It's it's to me, it's the same type of game changer that

53:21.760 --> 53:27.360
file sync was and SSH was like it's a it's a whole step change in functionality. And I guess always

53:27.360 --> 53:33.360
some some shout outs to old Jason Doenfeld for WarGuard in the fricking first place. Also, another

53:33.360 --> 53:38.320
favorite tool of the show is Nebula. It's another really great one that you can completely host

53:38.320 --> 53:42.960
yourself. You need to set it up a little bit more versus Tailscale. It's like, you know, especially

53:42.960 --> 53:46.560
for some of your you know, if you have like staticky backend infrastructure that you have

53:46.560 --> 53:51.760
deployed, like Nebula is great and super minimal and fast and clean. If you've got you know, like

53:51.760 --> 53:57.440
a great example would be just a couple of systems or VPS is spread out across a couple of providers

53:57.440 --> 54:02.160
and maybe like the local box and the you're planning to keep them forever. You don't really

54:02.160 --> 54:06.080
need mobile a mobile device in there. I think Nebula would work really well for that.

54:06.080 --> 54:11.200
Former Gentooer continued. I haven't heard you mentioned Keybase at all. The client is open

54:11.200 --> 54:17.840
source. The server is not ish. It uses GNU PG to implement and an encryption for several sorts of

54:17.840 --> 54:23.520
things. Full featured chat, group chat, file sharing, git repos even, and general encryption

54:23.520 --> 54:29.360
slash decryption of files. It can even act as a sort of social network where you follow people

54:29.360 --> 54:34.720
and can view their public file folders as well as privately chat with them. Works right on Linux,

54:34.720 --> 54:40.160
Mac, Windows, Android, iPhones, and of course it has a pretty capable command line interface as

54:40.160 --> 54:46.000
well. The former startup was acquired by Zoom in 2020 after those first security shenanigans,

54:46.000 --> 54:50.320
but everything on the client side still remains open source. Chris, I think you've used Keybase

54:50.320 --> 54:54.480
in the past. Have you not? Or you've explored it? I remember that. Yeah, I guess I still technically

54:54.480 --> 55:00.240
have an active Keybase account. I'm kind of sad Keybase never really took off more. It felt like

55:00.240 --> 55:04.640
it was out of all of like the sort of social things. I think it was a little early. It was

55:04.640 --> 55:11.440
a little complicated, but what it really gave you is a way to verify who you are, you know,

55:11.440 --> 55:17.360
because if you go look at like a Keybase profile, you can find mine, keybase.io slash Chris LAS,

55:17.360 --> 55:21.760
I think. And if you go there, you'll see sort of like these ways I've verified this is actually

55:21.760 --> 55:29.600
my identity. And that's pretty useful in, you know, the current world that we live in. And so

55:29.600 --> 55:35.680
I do that via some, you know, GPG keys. You can do that via Bitcoin addresses. You can do that via

55:35.680 --> 55:42.640
by proving a tweet, a GitHub entry, your Reddit account. I also put a file at JupiterBroadcasting.com

55:42.640 --> 55:47.520
that verifies that, you know, just to show that it's me. And I think that's a great concept. And

55:47.520 --> 55:52.400
then now they have a Slack-like chat interface. It works on Linux. Yeah, they have built a lot of

55:52.400 --> 55:57.200
kind of cool tools around Keybase. And it does seem like if you've taken the time to kind of set

55:57.200 --> 56:00.400
up your Keybase infrastructure and, you know, verify all these things and connect all your

56:00.400 --> 56:05.360
keys and identities, it can be well worth it because it kind of integrates all very nicely

56:05.360 --> 56:09.520
in a way that feels a little disparate and thrown out all over the place sometimes with our other

56:09.520 --> 56:14.240
solutions. I think the really the truth is, though, and you just can't overlook it, you can't just

56:14.240 --> 56:18.960
shrug it off, is that Zoom bought them. And I think that just leaves everybody with a little

56:18.960 --> 56:22.560
bit of a bad taste in their mouth. Especially considering the folks who were probably some

56:22.560 --> 56:26.560
of the primary consumers of Keybase, right? Like it was never probably going to be a giant

56:26.560 --> 56:30.880
mainstream thing. It was going to be for like privacy folks and tech nerds and all of whom

56:30.880 --> 56:35.760
are a little sketched out by Zoom maybe. I think that's part of it, right? And it's not like they've

56:35.760 --> 56:40.160
messed it up. They've pretty much just left it alone. It really doesn't seem like they've

56:40.160 --> 56:43.680
screwed up the product, but I guess that could change at any point. And I think it's just a

56:43.680 --> 56:47.680
non-starter issue for some people. Like, honestly, if I tried to get you on at Brent and I told you

56:47.680 --> 56:51.280
all about Keybase and then I told you it's owned by Zoom, wouldn't that give you pause? There's a

56:51.280 --> 57:12.400
hesitation for sure. Yeah, I would say so. I've been listening to you for about a year now and

57:12.400 --> 57:19.120
a question just crossed my mind. Well, hey, hey, welcome to the show. We're glad to have you.

57:19.120 --> 57:25.680
Their question, though. How do you guys all know each other or how did you all meet? That feels

57:25.680 --> 57:30.480
like a big question. I'm kind of glad this came up because it's all starting to fade for me. So

57:31.200 --> 57:35.360
I mean, I remember we tell me always known each other and we've always been doing this show.

57:35.360 --> 57:41.680
I don't really remember it before. Right. This is just a side realized last week,

57:42.640 --> 57:46.960
several weeks late, that Linux Unplugged has been running longer than Linux Action Show.

57:46.960 --> 57:54.320
Whoa, that is cool. Isn't that mind blowing? I believe Coda Radio has been too. Perhaps not

57:54.320 --> 57:59.760
in total years because we took some time off and we did a computer action show. We fooled around

57:59.760 --> 58:06.160
for a little bit, tried twice a month for a bit, but yeah, definitely in episode numbers and maybe

58:06.160 --> 58:13.040
an actual runtime. So I remember that for episode 100 of the Unplugged program, we did a barbecue

58:13.040 --> 58:21.760
meet up. And Wes came with food and commentary, and then I think it's just been every week since

58:21.760 --> 58:27.120
then. It's pretty much pretty much we got some like Mexican food and like talked about show

58:27.120 --> 58:31.200
stuff at one point, I seem to recall. Oh, OK. And he invited me back like a couple of times,

58:31.200 --> 58:35.120
like, hey, you want to come on again? And then at some point I just stopped leaving

58:35.680 --> 58:38.880
where I started. I just started showing up, I guess. I don't know if I was invited or not.

58:38.880 --> 58:43.440
I do like to warm people up with a little El Precios. That's one of my maneuvers.

58:43.440 --> 58:50.320
Now that you're talking about it, I sort of recall us revisiting. It might have been for episode 400

58:51.440 --> 58:56.320
that you did a revisit and you had a clip from the barbecue and Wes's first like on the air

58:56.320 --> 59:00.400
clip. And I think that was pretty great. And I remember playing it back and it was like,

59:00.400 --> 59:03.680
you'd think Wes had been doing it for 100 episodes. Like he just hit the ground running.

59:03.680 --> 59:07.440
So I was like, well, this guy's got to get on the show. Brent, remind me, how did we meet?

59:07.440 --> 59:13.760
I must have been through the shows Linux Fest. OK. Yeah. What else do you remember?

59:13.760 --> 59:17.680
It's like I say, it's all fate. That's why we got it. It's good. We do this.

59:17.680 --> 59:23.920
Yeah, it is. I think Linux Fest is probably a well, both a great place to meet people and

59:23.920 --> 59:28.400
also a place where those memories just get sort of squashed and there's so much happening. And

59:28.400 --> 59:32.240
yeah, this was Linux Northwest. So I think it was must have been.

59:32.240 --> 59:38.960
Maybe 2017 would be my best guess. Wow, really? Yeah. And I had planned I was living in Northern

59:38.960 --> 59:45.760
Ontario at the time and I had planned to see my brother who was out here in B.C. and also do a

59:45.760 --> 59:51.040
little road trip to go to my very first Linux Fest. And that happened to be Linux Fest Northwest.

59:52.560 --> 59:59.120
And of course, as a JB fan boy at the time, I wanted to meet all the folks and I ended up

59:59.120 --> 01:00:05.360
driving from B.C. I think. Oh, yeah. Oh, that was what a crazy time. Anyways, I rented a car

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:12.880
and drove from B.C. across the border into the US and made my way to the Linux Fest Northwest

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:17.840
parking lot the night before the event started. And it was so late and I didn't have a hotel.

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:21.360
I had a tent, but there was nowhere to pitch it. And I was like, OK, I guess I'm going to sleep

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:25.440
in the back of this car that I've rented, which is not the first time I've done this.

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:30.080
And you're in a pinch, you know, you're very resourceful. Right. I did bring water and I ended

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:35.440
up sort of on campus where they hold Linux Fest Northwest. And I just so happened to find JOOPS.

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:38.880
And I was like, well, I think I'm in the right place. I don't know exactly where to go when the

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:44.000
event starts, but I know at least I'm in the right vicinity. Yeah, we were there overnight

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.440
camping as well. So we were there the night before. That's true. We're kind of hard to miss.

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:52.720
Right. And I and then as I was parking, I was like, well, I don't want to park too close to be

01:00:52.720 --> 01:01:00.160
like that creep. That's, you know, just within the bounds of the creepy creepiness, but not so far

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:05.200
that I don't like. I don't know. So I picked a spot camp there. I think it was like two or three

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:10.400
nights in that car. It's crazy. So I met you at the booth the very first time. You probably met

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:14.960
100 people at that booth. So I don't think you remember. No. Is that true? I thought we met in

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:18.800
the I thought we met in the parking lot in the morning when we let Levi out to go to the bathroom

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:23.760
and you were out kind of like waking up and stretching. Oh, yeah. Oh, you're right. I mean,

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:28.560
I'm not a morning person. So you're right. I was like, I don't know, brushing my teeth or something

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:34.560
out of a out of a bottle or something. My first thought was, did this guy did he time it so that

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:38.320
way we'd be he'd be out there when we came out? Like, I was wondering, was he waiting for us?

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:42.320
Like, I do remember that night. It rained like crazy, too. And I had my windows open and that

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:47.840
caused some issues. Oh, man. Oh, yeah. Good memory. I was like, I don't know. I don't know.

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:54.160
Yeah, I was aware that I didn't want to, like, jump you guys at that point and be one of those

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:59.760
one of those people. So I was hopefully I left enough space. But, you know, Levi is a

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:06.080
conversation starter, and I'm pretty sure we got to talk and and, you know. Yeah. And so thankfully,

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:11.920
I that meant, well, you guys were great. You as as all the fans who've met, you know that

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:18.480
you just invited me in and gave me a tour of lady jupes. And Levi and I became friends

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:27.120
immediately. And I think that just started sort of friendship. And then a few days later, you

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:32.720
invited us, of course, to a barbecue at the studio. And I think I never left. I remember

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:40.080
sleeping on the floor of the studio one night. And, and I just had a great time post post Linux

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:45.600
fest parties at the studio. They got they got out of hand. Yeah. Yeah. Wonderfully so. And

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:49.760
Alan was there and a whole bunch of people. It was a great time. Right. We probably had

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:56.320
several projects going on. I'm sure you just got, you know, you know. Yeah. It's funny how those

01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:01.600
those Linux fest can be life changing. That's exactly what it was. It was like me going to live

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:07.840
out a small dream that I had for a few years. And it was even better than I would have expected. And

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:12.640
I remember taking a bunch of photos and being able to share those, which was fun. And that

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:19.840
friendship just grew from there. And I was able to actually the way I started with Linux unplugged

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:25.200
just by chance was that at that time, I said to you, Hey, if I can help in any way that let me

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:29.840
know. You said, Okay, well, hit me up in like two weeks, because it's kind of insane right now. And

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:34.640
so I did. And you were like, Oh, well, actually, Wes is like going to Bali or something. And I

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:39.760
need a co host for Linux unplugged for a short time. You want to join me? I was like, sure.

01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:45.360
Let's see how this goes. I've had that. Yeah, right. That was I was super nervous back then.

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:50.160
But you were you were kind enough to give me a try. And then I never left. I bet we talked about

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:54.400
digital photography. That was I was fascinated. You know, probably professional photographer

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:59.840
using Linux. It was, you know, I don't see those every day. Bronzewing, thank you for the boost.

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:04.880
That was a fun conversation and good refresher. Get all that recalled before we forget it.

01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:11.760
But the boosts they must go on. Our next one is from solely 86 with 5000 cents.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:18.800
A longtime listener in Australia here. I'm using fountain thanks to JB. So I'm boosting back the

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:24.080
free sets I received from them. Well, thank you, silly. Wow, that's a decent return there on the

01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:29.200
stream of sats 5000 for listening to podcasts. That's a feature in fountain FM is they kind of

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:33.680
have like this incentive system. And so we've been getting more boosts from new from new timers who

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:37.200
are just listening to the shows, collecting the sats and then sending them back through boosts.

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:42.640
And I've been doing the same thing. It's been fun. Slowly goes on. I work in it. And of course,

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:48.560
we're all Microsoft. I have managed to have most of my workflow in Linux. However, the most

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:56.640
important thing is outlook and dot msg files. I like using outlook on the web. However, the business

01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:03.600
workflow and ticketing system relies on those msg files. Got any ideas on how I can open msg files

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:10.720
in Linux without needing to convert the files? Thanks for the great content. The the not needing

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:17.920
to convert is tricky. I would say it's worth seeing what evolution can do. I think you'd be really

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:22.960
surprised at how easily evolution integrates in with an outlook ecosystem. But it's a lot to

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:28.640
install. Personally, I would just make a copy of stuff and I would convert it. I don't know about

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:32.800
us, but that's what my approach would be. Yeah, probably. It sounds like maybe there's some ways

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:36.800
to get Thunderbird to play decently there, too, although I have not tried that. And then as a

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:40.960
last resort, we'll have a link to msg convert, which if you have to go to a conversion based

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:45.520
workflows, it looks like I think it might even be derived from Thunderbird. And it's a little

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:53.040
pearl script to handle msg conversions. I think of it as backup, right? Don't think of it as

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:58.080
conversion and duplication. Think of it as backup. Wolfman wrote in with 500 sets,

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:04.160
just completed my resume, getting my amateur radio license, and then it occurred to me,

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:09.200
does anyone else at JB have their ham license? I've never heard the topic come up on air before

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:14.320
something like a DMR repeater or hosting a community DMR server sounds like something

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:21.440
the community may get interested in. I kind of agree. We don't talk about ham much. I don't

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:26.320
know much about it, but I think it's super cool. And every time Noah is around, I try to get him

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:32.800
to talk about it so I can learn some language. Noah's even left a few devices here, so we

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:38.880
technically have devices. I don't know if I'm allowed to use them. I think Cheese was interested

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:44.880
in that stuff too. I remember him doing some like emergency preparedness stuff in his area during,

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:48.800
you know, remember when they got flooded and stuff like that down in Texas. So I think he's got some

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:52.800
experience if I remember. Definitely seems like there's a lot of sort of kindred spirits there,

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:57.120
right? Like this sort of self hosting it yourself, learning how this technology works,

01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:01.360
understanding the physics and computers all involved. Like, yeah, that's some excellent

01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:09.440
geekery right there. It's the original decentralized. We got a boost 2222 sats row of ducks

01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:16.400
from someone named Nix Dash Bitcoin is amazing. I love that. Welcome back. Nix Dash Bitcoin. It's

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:21.120
been a bit since we've heard from you. This is what got me into Nix. So nice. I obviously agree.

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:25.920
They're right. Have you considered an AC enclosure in your garage for the server?

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:31.120
The enclosure keeps the machines cool and clean. However, if the AC stops running for any reason,

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:38.000
then the enclosure will actually turn into a furnace. Chris, I feel like you and I talked

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:44.080
quite a bit about this, I think almost exactly a year ago when we built Oh, no, in January,

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:49.040
we built the server rack. And we had many conversations about this. And those were some

01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:54.720
of the hesitations was like, Okay, well, if we put in some infrastructure, someone has to maintain

01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:59.520
that infrastructure as well. So how can we do it? I had some ideas about doing it passively. But I

01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:04.080
wonder what your thoughts are now that you've been living with the heat again. Of course,

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:09.440
I've been all over the spectrum on this. I am beginning to discount colo. We got we got more

01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:14.880
boosts that came in just like I want I want a second that the colo stuff. Cool. Cool your role

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:19.840
on that. We got some people that that had that opinion. And, you know, we've talked about maybe

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:25.200
building a box in the garage. But Jeff and I were talking before the show started. You know, Jeff's

01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:30.080
been out here he's seen the studio. You think maybe we could do it with some insulation and

01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:35.360
decent cooling? Or at least we have a shot. Yeah, I think if we insulate the garage attic,

01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:40.320
because those are typically not insulated at all, maybe double insulate, you know, where it usually

01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:45.840
is at the barrier of the roof and then up top with the rafters and then definitely insulate the

01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:51.680
garage door itself. That might be enough with a little you know, a fan a little bit of airflow

01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:55.680
doesn't get too hot up there. Yeah. And if it you know, if we kept it somewhere in the 80 degree

01:08:55.680 --> 01:09:00.080
range, you know, maybe even a little higher, I'd be fine with that. The servers have survived that,

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:04.880
you know, it's all used gear. Well, I mean, we don't need it to be necessarily perfect uptime,

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:08.320
you know, like if there was okay, there's two heat, we heat waves a year and we shut it down

01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:12.160
for those. That's at least a lot better than where we're at now. I foresee me being in the

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:18.400
attic here in a week or two. I could see that coming. I'll bring a suit. You know, we'll bring

01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:22.560
Jeff up with us after the road trip, right? And all of us will come up and we'll insulate the

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:27.600
garage. Let's make a plan and I'll take the time off. Let's go. All right. Well, that way,

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:34.640
Brent can record up there. Yeah. All right. You're right. That'll be soundproof. Very good.

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:39.040
I think it could work, guys. I think it could work. All right. Then I just have a couple of

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:46.160
shout outs. A 50 sats from a VIP torso listening from Finland for over a year,

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:51.760
sent in 50 sats. That's like a penny, but it's just amazing that you can do it, right? Like,

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:56.400
that's what I think people have to appreciate about Lightning. We got a row of ducks from Mr.

01:09:56.400 --> 01:10:01.760
Quackers who said he's thinking about changing his name. Whoa. Yeah, he's thinking about changing

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:07.840
his name. I would be sad. I like Mr. Quackers. I think we have a really great sound bite that

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:13.360
goes with it. Quacka Wacka, it's a treasure. Pick your new name based on sound bite ability.

01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:22.960
That's all we have. We got 2,000 sats from Trevdev who I said loves GUICs. Geeks. I call it GUICs,

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:27.840
but it's Geeks. I know we're drawing the summer of immutability to a close, but maybe I need to

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:34.800
sneak Geeks in there. Good. Now use this scheme. Yeah. There's only so many days in the summer,

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:41.600
though. We also got 2,323 sats from Logic. He boosted when we were live, and we were having

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:44.080
some trouble last week, and he was helping troubleshoot, so I'm going to be leaving

01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:48.560
Helipad up during live shows. We don't actually have the live tag yet, but some people are still

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:52.080
boosting it during the show, so I don't want to miss those. If you'd like to send us a boost,

01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:58.320
go grab a new podcast app, newpodcastapps.com. Podverse is totally free. It's in F-Droid. It's

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:04.080
on iOS. It's in Android, and it's going to be all over our new website. Then you really get the

01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:10.800
trifecta because the web, the mobile apps, GPL, it's gorgeous. You heard us talk about Fountain.

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:16.960
That's one that lets you actually earn sats for listening to podcasts, and Cast-O-Matic is great

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:21.920
on iOS as well. There's a whole bunch over at newpodcastapps.com, including Breeze. You don't

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:28.800
have to change your podcast app and boost CLI if you really want to be a Geek. We got a bag of

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:33.360
picks here, and what do you say, Wes? Should we give just a mention to Visi Data? That was one of

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:39.680
the many tools that you used to go sort the hat to get our JPL names. Yeah, we definitely should,

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:45.360
just because you know how we love dirty command line picks, and this is one that multiple audience

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:49.120
members, you know, anytime we talked about fun little command line tools or especially like

01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:55.680
command line spreadsheets or like data manipulation or charts, Visi Data came up, and I hadn't had a

01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:59.680
chance to actually play with it until I was kind of going through these CSVs that we got out of

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:03.840
our next cloud and thinking, you know, there's got to be a better way. I don't really want to

01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:08.800
do this in a browser. I definitely don't need LibreOffice installed on this machine. I have a

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:13.600
terminal. Visi Data was perfect. You can do operations on multiple rows, multiple columns.

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:18.240
You can do pivot tables. You can do charts, and because it's all like powered with Python,

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:23.840
you can just run your own Python scripts on the data powered by Visi Data. It's pretty rad.

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:28.240
It was very handy. I think this is probably a tool we'll be going to for these types of things

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:35.200
in the future, and I love that it has pivot tables. MiniMech sent in a Google Teller pick.

01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:39.680
This one's kind of creepy, isn't it, MiniMech? Yeah, that's a really cool one. We will love

01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:45.200
that one. So, I was reading my favorite news site, which is Der Standard Arteis, an Austrian

01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:50.160
news site. Give it a try if you're familiar with the German language. So, they wrote an article

01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:56.000
about that tool, Google Teller, and that is a tool that gives you some feedback from your internal

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:01.200
computer speaker whenever there is some data exchange between your browser and one of the

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:07.120
Google servers and services, like Google Search, Google Ads, Google Fonts, YouTube, whatever.

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:12.240
So, imagine the situation you have Google Chrome or Chromium open, and you type something in the

01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:18.160
address bar. In these two browsers, you have the active word prediction active. So, whenever you

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:23.200
type a letter in there, your computer starts beeping, and that, in the end effect, means

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:28.160
every single address you type in in Google Chrome and Chromium in the address bar gets sent to

01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:33.680
Google. Everything, everything. Other example, you have an ad blocker. You don't have an ad blocker,

01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:39.200
and you start loading your favorite news site. Your computer is screaming because of all the

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:45.600
Google ads, for example. Interesting fact, you have the whole site loaded, and you start scrolling

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:50.800
around, and all of a sudden, you have these beeps again because, I don't know, some cookie sends the

01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:56.800
exact position you are on that site or some other info to Google. It is really a weird, interesting

01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:02.240
experience. So, that tool is really worth playing. You will find the code on GitHub. You have to

01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:07.360
compile it, and it's only working in Linux for now because it works in combination with other

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:12.400
IP tables. But, in fact, the installation instructions and usage are well described,

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:16.480
and I guess you will do a link in the show notes. You got it. We will have a link in the show notes.

01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:22.000
If you want a little audible indication that motivates you to get rid of Google as fast as

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:28.640
possible, that's the way to do it. Imagine combining that with a game plan to migrate

01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:33.280
off Google in one week to just really get you across the finish line. You should treat it maybe

01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:36.960
like a radar detection tool, you know, where you hear those little beeps and you worry about your

01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:43.120
safety. And then, Brett, we have a feedback item that came in. It's a feedback pick. We do. Josh

01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:48.480
wrote in and suggested Espanso. I think it's probably the best way to say that. It's an

01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:53.920
open source text expander that has builds for Windows, Linux, and Mac with Wayland and M1

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:58.640
beta support as well. Get out of here. Whoa. Yeah, I know. As you might have expected,

01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:04.240
it's also written in Rust. Are you serious? That's great.

01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:12.160
So this is really handy because text expander is one of these independent tools on the Mac. I

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:19.280
think it's, I don't know. But you type a sequence of characters, you know, like some sort of short

01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:23.920
code that you've created, and then it will expand that to a whole set of predefined text that

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:30.000
supports variables and whatnot. Super common for just doing rapid replies to emails or some sort

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.840
of repetitive thing that you have to type a lot. You add a short code for it, and then it expands

01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:38.160
it out into a fuller sentence or whatever it might be. Maybe you want to insert your address

01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:41.760
or your email address and you don't want to type it out every single time or a web address or

01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:46.320
maybe it's a block of code. And it's a really handy tool. I've tried it. I find it to be really

01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:50.960
heavy on the Mac and expensive, so I've never really tried it for a prolonged period of time.

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:56.800
But the idea that you can get this working on Wayland is huge because I kind of had given up

01:15:56.800 --> 01:16:00.160
on this concept. I thought this was going to be something I could only do on X11. So this is a

01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:06.560
fantastic find. Plus, it looks like it's GPL3. I mean, that's kind of rad and Rust and quick and

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:12.320
a really slick little website and a nice little repo and seemingly some good docs. What a find.

01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:16.560
This is a treat. Like pretty often we've heard of the apps that get sent in, but

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:22.160
oh my gosh. And it has packages. Of course, all these things have packages so you can extend it,

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:28.240
add more stuff, shell script support, form support. Oh, that's nice. So you can add,

01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:32.320
you can replace some of the variables. Oh, this is getting installed after the show,

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:36.800
gentlemen. That's what I say. They've got a tab. There's an app image here. Hey, yo. Hey,

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:44.000
Wes, see if it's in the next package. Not this problem again. I'm sure it's in there. You are,

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:49.040
dang it. Well, that was great. If you want to send us in something, either a boost or a regular old

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:54.240
email, that's just great. You can head over to linuxunplug.com slash contact. I'm curious to

01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:58.880
know out there if anybody out there has endless OS in production or maybe you've deployed it for

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:04.640
somebody. If that's you, send us a boost or send us an email and let us know how you're using it.

01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:09.440
I'm trying to get a sense of how well it's known in our audience. I guess on that same token,

01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:13.280
I would like to know if you'd never heard about it. Let us know that too. I'd like some,

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:18.400
just some kind of data points around endless OS and how it's perceived out there or how it's

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:23.760
getting used. And if you want to join us live on a Sunday, we do this show over at jupyter.tube

01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:29.280
at noon Pacific, 3pm Eastern. And something that we do for our members at unpluggedcore.com

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:37.200
is we record this live stream, which is huge. It's like two hours and 20 minutes ish. It's

01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:41.840
getting close to that right now as we go. It's just a lot more show. We have some stuff we're

01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:46.320
doing. We got business we're attending to and you get to listen in on all that. See how the podcast

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:50.560
sausage is made. And we also make an ad-free version available as well, if you just prefer

01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:55.040
something short, concise and fully produced by our editor, Drew. That's unpluggedcore.com if you'd

01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:59.120
like to support the show and keep us independent. That's like the turkey bacon to the sausage of

01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:03.760
the full show. Yeah. And you can get the full, like what would it be when you do the Jupiter

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:08.080
party? Would that be like the meat pack or what is that? Like it's a veggie burger stack? Like

01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:14.160
full English breakfast. Yeah. I get the full English breakfast over at jupyter.party. Support

01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:18.160
all the shows, get all the features. You pick which shows the blood sausage though.

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:26.800
That's right. You had to go there, Wes. No, Wes. No. I'm going to get that visual out of my head.

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:31.360
I think I like mashed potatoes. Maybe one of them is mashed potatoes. Maybe one of them is catfish.

01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:36.960
I don't know. You let me know. I don't know. Don't miss Linux Action News. That's all I know.

01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:41.280
That's all I know. Linuxactionnews.com. We're covering the stuff that really matters in the

01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:46.800
world of Linux and open source every single week. We'd love you to catch it. So go grab that. And

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:53.280
links to everything we talked about today over at linuxunplug.com 473. You get our mumble info,

01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:58.240
our matrix info, the contact form, all of it over there. And go check out the new site,

01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:02.240
new.jupyterbroadcasting.com. Let us know what you think. Thanks for joining us.

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:17.520
See you right back here next Sunday.

01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:43.120
So let's talk about that new website. We're down to the final hours.

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:44.560
Is it hours? I thought we had days.

01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:47.600
I think you could measure it in actual hours.

01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:48.000
That's right.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.720
It's true. We need a countdown. We need a countdown.

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:52.880
Some say it is the final countdown.

01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:55.120
Final countdown.

01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:56.000
Yeah, I see it.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
We don't have a license for that. Dang it.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:03.200
Well, I could just sing it. That's fine. It's definitely the last kind of week for what we

01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:13.920
have. I had it, so I had to use it.

01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:16.480
Well, if you got it, use it if you got it.

01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:22.640
Yeah, I feel like it's definitely we can say it's the last week for our what we're calling

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:28.560
the 1.0 milestone of the website. I think maybe the three of us should have some discussions on

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:34.000
whether or not the current website does everything we need on the as far as the back end goes.

01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:39.200
But as far as front end, I feel like the new website has gotten really far. Chris,

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:43.840
I know there's a bunch of like features that have been implemented in the last what week or

01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:50.480
week and a half that have been helping you quite a bit, like the PeerTube embed and stuff like that.

01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:55.280
That's my favorite one. Let's be honest. There's so much good work going in. So I don't want to

01:20:55.280 --> 01:21:01.440
play favorites. I love all my children. But how awesome is this? So I may have mentioned this

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:08.560
already, but now when you go to the new new dot Jupiter broadcasting dot com site and you click

01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:16.080
live, that site will auto embed the current live stream from PeerTube just automatically gives you

01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:19.120
the current live stream. We don't have to do anything. We don't have to put embed code in

01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:24.400
there. It just drops it right in there. No updates, no manual stuff. It's awesome.

01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:28.080
And it's great because it's a static website, too. So the way you really have to do that is you'd

01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:32.240
have to go edit the site, rebuild the site, redeploy the site. Right. So it's so nice that

01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:38.320
it just automatically embeds and updates. It's coming along. I think it's getting really close

01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:42.000
to a one point. I think there's a little few you know, there's a few things like down here we can

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:46.240
still clean up the bottom and stuff like that. But yeah, there's a bit of bit of stuff to do.

01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:51.760
But I feel like the essentials important part is like all the you know, all the bones, right? All

01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:56.080
the pieces that like are hard to figure out or can it work that way? It seems like that is all

01:21:56.080 --> 01:22:01.760
resolved. And now it's kind of just the polishing layers. And I want to say a huge kudos to everyone

01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:07.440
who's been helping on this project. I've been super impressed with how many people have been

01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:13.840
involved in the matrix room, but also the number of people who've been committing ideas and changes

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:21.200
and opinions and all of that to the project. So thank you to everyone. And I think it's important

01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:28.960
to say that Kyle Potts put in quite an amazing PR last week, and it just got merged,

01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:39.600
I think a day or two ago. They wrote some intent testing via playwright for the site. And I am

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:45.760
still on the very edge of beginning to understand what that means. But I think it is it helps us

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:51.840
test the the commits that are coming in in a way that emulates browsers, that's going to be super

01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:56.240
helpful for us not breaking the site in production, which we've done a few times in the last few

01:22:56.240 --> 01:23:00.560
weeks. So that sounds like an amazing tool. I'm looking forward to learning it. I don't know if

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:05.200
either of you played with that, Wes, maybe you have, but we're certainly going to talk more

01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:10.480
about it in office hours this coming Tuesday. Great office hours dot hair.
