1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,080
I can't believe I'm saying this,

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,920
but I've switched away from systemd.

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:04,920
What?

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:05,880
I don't believe it.

5
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,080
I'm just kidding.

6
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:18,080
Hello friends, and welcome into a very special Linux Unplugged.

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,920
This is episode 314.

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,920
My name is Chris.

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,920
My name is Wes.

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,920
Hello, Wes.

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,920
Hello.

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,920
How are you doing?

13
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,920
I'm doing great, because we've got a full house today.

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,920
We do.

15
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,760
It's a special week here at the Jupiter Broadcasting Studios.

16
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,960
We have the full core team in-house.

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,200
And I guess that's my quick way of saying people that are all involved in creating a

18
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,180
brand new podcast for the network are in-house this week.

19
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:44,640
And that means that we have a whole cast of characters here helping us get various jobs

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,640
done.

21
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,880
So I want to say a very happy hello to Mr. Cheese Bacon.

22
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,880
Hello Cheezy.

23
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,880
Hello.

24
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,880
Hello.

25
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,880
Hello.

26
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,880
Good to have you here.

27
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,880
Thank you.

28
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,880
It's good to have everyone here.

29
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,880
And hello to Alex.

30
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,880
Nice to have you in studio, Alex.

31
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,880
Howdy, y'all.

32
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,880
Nice to have you.

33
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,880
You're sounding good, sir.

34
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,880
You're sounding...

35
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,880
That sounded nearly real.

36
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,880
Thank you.

37
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,880
Nearly.

38
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,880
Nearly.

39
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,880
And it's always good to have Brent back in studio.

40
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,880
Hello, Brent.

41
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,880
Well, hello, everyone.

42
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,880
How are you doing?

43
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,880
I'm great.

44
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,440
It's good to be connected via real, like, cords and stuff to the studio.

45
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,440
That's nice.

46
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,440
Brent made me breakfast.

47
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,440
What?

48
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,440
Mm-hmm.

49
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,440
Brent made me breakfast today.

50
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,440
He's such a gentleman.

51
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,440
It's so good.

52
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,440
And Drew barbecued lunch.

53
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,440
So...

54
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,440
Pays to have the team around.

55
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,280
Now, of course, this wouldn't be a Linux Unplugged without our virtual log.

56
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,280
Time-appropriate greetings there, Mumble Room.

57
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,280
Hello.

58
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,280
Hello.

59
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,280
Hello.

60
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,280
Hello.

61
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,280
It's really good to...

62
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,280
Aloha.

63
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,280
Aloha, Neil.

64
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,280
Aloha.

65
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,280
Welcome back.

66
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,280
Neil will be giving us his flock report in a moment.

67
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,800
But, Emma, I just have to say, it's super great to see you back.

68
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,800
How are you doing?

69
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,800
I'm doing good.

70
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,720
I will be off crutches pretty soon, but I returned to System 76, I've returned to the

71
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,720
factory.

72
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,480
So I'm moving around pretty good these days.

73
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,560
Man, if people don't follow Emma, social happiness on Twitter.

74
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,640
She recently had a serious medical situation.

75
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,960
Just, I mean, unbelievable to watch from afar, Emma.

76
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,960
So...

77
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,860
It was a safari accident, to be specific.

78
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,280
That is very cool.

79
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,040
We should make that a disclaimer because, you know, other people get injured, but Emma

80
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,220
got injured on a safari.

81
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,520
So that's true.

82
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,520
But it's really good to see you back.

83
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,080
I've been following your journey on Twitter.

84
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,400
Nice to see you back at work.

85
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,680
We have some cool stuff you and I are going to be talking about in a little bit today

86
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,680
too.

87
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,680
So I'm glad you're here.

88
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,640
Let's kick things off with a wee bit of community news.

89
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,920
Did you see all of this hoopla around this horrible bug that was discovered in KDE that

90
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,800
could potentially make it vulnerable to attack?

91
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,280
And then the KDE project responded by just ripping the feature out of Plasma, I understand.

92
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,280
What happened last?

93
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,280
Yeah.

94
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,220
So it's not, you can call it a bug or really it's a design decision because it turns out

95
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,600
you can execute scripts in your.desktop or.directory files.

96
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,480
And why would you want to do that?

97
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,160
You know, the funny part is when they removed the functionality to do that, the words accompanying

98
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,320
the removal were, we didn't really have a use case.

99
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,320
But you can imagine, right?

100
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,240
It's just like a little hook you can run.

101
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,240
You can have a script.

102
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,360
Run a script to set up an environment ahead of time.

103
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,440
I mean, I could kind of-

104
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,080
I've never wanted to.

105
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,080
Yeah.

106
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,080
Yeah.

107
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,080
So that's funny.

108
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,080
So they just ripped it out.

109
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,080
Yeah.

110
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,080
You know, there was a little kerfuffle here.

111
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,080
Defcon was going on.

112
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,960
So the researcher disclosed it in a way that the KDE project was not too pleased about

113
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,840
because it just showed up on Twitter.

114
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,000
And the researcher actually sort of stated that, well, Defcon was coming up and I just

115
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
wanted to get this out there.

116
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,760
Man, that shit really pisses me off.

117
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,280
The one thing is when you're doing this is be responsible.

118
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,420
Be responsible and work with the project.

119
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:37,920
And going on Twitter just to build your personal brand has got to be one of the worst human

120
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,000
being things to do because not only do you make a project look a little foolish because

121
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,720
you don't give them the opportunity to work with a heads up that just about everybody

122
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,480
else gets, but you're putting real users at risk to make yourself look good.

123
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,480
Yeah.

124
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,480
There's just no point.

125
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,480
I mean-

126
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,480
It's disgusting.

127
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,480
We could have got this solved and pushed out before anyone knew.

128
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,460
Now, I doubt that this was being abused in the wild.

129
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,400
It's not a super important vulnerability, but still-

130
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,620
How do you think I have good form?

131
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,880
How do you think I got that key logger on your laptop?

132
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,880
What?

133
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,880
Yeah.

134
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,880
Dang it.

135
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,880
Yeah.

136
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,880
We'll have links though.

137
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,880
You can go read the...

138
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,420
There is a little white paper about the vulnerability and you can go see that, well, that feature,

139
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,420
it's gone.

140
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:23,320
Finally, ladies and gentlemen, we have perhaps the first modern core boot server platform.

141
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,840
Supermicro's X11 SSH TF, I love the name because it's got SSH in it, is a platform

142
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,820
that supports core boot.

143
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:35,480
This platform is the first modern upstream core boot server platform on the market with

144
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:43,040
an Intel Xeon E3 1200 V6 processor, which commonly known as the Kaby Lake DT.

145
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,780
Now, Wes, you did a little sleuthing into why Supermicro would be interested in doing

146
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,000
this and what the motivations are behind this development.

147
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,600
It kind of checks out, kind of makes sense.

148
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
Right.

149
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,560
So this was over at the Nine ESEC site.

150
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,040
They've worked with Moldat, which is a VPN provider, and it's all part of the system

151
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,480
transparency project.

152
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,940
And basically the idea is to get as much of this stuff open sourced and transparent as

153
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,200
you can, especially if you're interested as they are as a VPN provider of being able to

154
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,880
guarantee things to their customers about how their systems run.

155
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,040
And it's all well and good to have an OS that has audit logs and shows that you're not keeping

156
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,320
other logs or exactly what you are keeping.

157
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,980
But when you can't trust the firmware, you can't trust anything else.

158
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,140
So true.

159
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:32,840
You can see from a marketing standpoint, this is a great thing to have on your site, fully

160
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:38,760
audible platform from the VPN software all the way down to the core boot hardware of

161
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,760
this system.

162
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,560
And, I mean, as you've seen, if you've ever tried to use core boot, most of the time anything

163
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,480
that supports it is way out of date.

164
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,440
But that's just not going to work if you're trying to run a business.

165
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,920
Speaking of core boot, our friends over at System76 and Emma have a little news around

166
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,920
core boot.

167
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,920
It appears System76 are preparing to roll out their first core boot enabled laptop,

168
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,800
which is, I think this news is coming out just ahead of this year's open source firmware

169
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,800
conference.

170
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,520
I bet those two things are not unrelated, Emma.

171
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,920
It is exciting.

172
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:14,360
And people that pre-order with the open firmware will get to pick up their daughters at the

173
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,360
conference.

174
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,360
Whoa.

175
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,360
Cool.

176
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,780
What kind of work has this taken behind the scenes to make this possible?

177
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:25,960
Is there like some sort of a crazy mad scientist lab where people are hacking away on firmwares?

178
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,760
Has there been some sort of collaboration with another group?

179
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,240
What has been the engineering side of this?

180
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,280
This has been in-house led by our lead engineer, Jeremy.

181
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:42,480
He's very big into open firmware and developing in Rust.

182
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,880
And he's been putting it on all the laptops.

183
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,120
They've taken them apart if needed.

184
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,280
They've had to work with Thunderbolt to get proper licensing to include in our core boot.

185
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,600
We've had to work on suspend issues.

186
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:02,040
Right now, the Darter and the Gazelle both are doing pretty good supporting core boot

187
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,120
fully.

188
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,000
So it's these two systems.

189
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,200
Is it possible for existing purchasers, like people who have a Darter that maybe they got

190
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,200
it six months ago?

191
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,400
Would it be possible for them to switch over to core boot and Linux boot?

192
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,440
Or is this only going to be the new systems?

193
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,760
This should be anyone that currently has a Darter should be able to do it.

194
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:25,920
And I'm guessing we'll have people reaching out in support if they want to implement that

195
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,320
or test it out, and we'll be happy to give them instructions.

196
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,400
So what's the sales pitch now?

197
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,560
Is it user security and privacy?

198
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,600
How does System76 look at this?

199
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,480
What is the value this adds to the product?

200
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,500
Well, we want to make sure the entire product is open.

201
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:50,800
So this puts us a step closer to that, moving away from as much proprietary software as

202
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,400
we can.

203
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:59,480
And this also lets us get to the lowest level of the hardware so we can maximize performance

204
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,640
and just tailor the performance towards the user's needs.

205
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:12,360
I also noticed the brand new shiny 4K OLED display at our workstation was announced.

206
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:19,920
And this thing is such a monster that we were speculating last week about what its capabilities

207
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,920
were.

208
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,400
And sure enough, you guys said, well, why don't we send you out a test rig?

209
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,160
So in a couple of weeks, in a few weeks, we may have a review here of the new Adder workstation.

210
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,160
What's your take on this new one?

211
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,960
I bet you must be pretty impressed.

212
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,040
You've seen a lot of laptops come out the doors there.

213
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:42,480
But this one's 4K OLED, RTX 2070 graphics, 8-core Intel i9, 64 gigs of RAM in a laptop?

214
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,880
Yeah, she's a beauty.

215
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,760
If anyone picks her up, I'm guessing if you're a laptop namer, it's going to have some sexy

216
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,760
woman name.

217
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,760
Yeah, it seems like a lady with that display.

218
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,760
Beautiful eyes, you know.

219
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,760
It's beautiful eyes.

220
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,760
Yeah.

221
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,160
The contrast ratio is actually 100,000 to one.

222
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,160
Oh.

223
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,080
So the contrast is pretty extreme.

224
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,620
And it also has the nits.

225
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,760
It's 400 nits.

226
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,560
So it's pretty bright as well.

227
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,560
That sounds wonderful.

228
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,000
I think we've all been waiting for a laptop like that.

229
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,280
I have a couple of different use cases.

230
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:18,160
I want to bring it in in-house and see how it processes the drone footage because that's

231
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,300
brought just about every machine down to its knees.

232
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,720
And then set it up as a VM machine, maybe attempt to do some PCI pass-through with it.

233
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,200
When you're talking specs like this.

234
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,040
Yeah, we haven't tried the GPU pass-through yet, but that is on the slate for this week

235
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,040
for sure.

236
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,040
Oh.

237
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,040
Well, I'll let you know.

238
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,000
Yeah, definitely one of the things I would like to test it out and kind of run it through

239
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,720
its paces would be just rendering out video, Blender work, that sort of stuff.

240
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,560
And I mean, they depict it here on the actual landing page for the site.

241
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:52,680
So with that 2070 in there, you should really be able in the 4K display, you should really

242
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,560
be able to get some high quality graphic and design work done off of this machine.

243
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,040
This also be like one of my first longer term hands-on with a Pop!

244
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,040
OS.

245
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,040
Right.

246
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,040
Looking forward.

247
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,040
I've been waiting.

248
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,800
And then the last thing that I know, I've been looking at the specs of this machine.

249
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,520
The one thing that I really like so far just from the outset is a lot of the big bulky

250
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:20,000
ports are on the back of the laptop, the power, the Ethernet, the HDMI, the DisplayPort, a

251
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
USB-A, NC.

252
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,640
That works so well when you're just setting it up on a mobile desk.

253
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,640
It's so clean.

254
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,640
Yeah.

255
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,860
So I'm really looking forward to it, Emma.

256
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,580
And I'm really glad you're able to make it back and chat with us about the news.

257
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,580
It's great to see the core boot systems.

258
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:37,020
So what's kind of the timeline for that to be just the default when people order one

259
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,100
of those machines?

260
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,280
I don't have information on that yet.

261
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:44,220
It's really hard to predict with Nvidia models.

262
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,600
It's an ongoing project, but I do need to mention one other thing.

263
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,580
The Adder is currently on sale for about another month.

264
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,520
So if anyone is interested, we do have a 30-day return period.

265
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,240
So now is the right time to purchase one.

266
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,240
Okay.

267
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,520
Also kind of just saw this slip through the news, but it's probably worth mentioning too,

268
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,020
is that it looks like System76 has been granted a Thunderbolt license.

269
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,020
That seems huge.

270
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,020
Yeah.

271
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:15,520
We're the core boot, so we can implement Thunderbolt functionality and core boot systems.

272
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,520
That's fantastic.

273
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,980
That was one of the lingering questions I had.

274
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,260
That's great to see.

275
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,900
Well, Emma, that looks like an awesome release.

276
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:26,260
I can't wait to try it out and kick the tires and see if I can't make it suffer a little

277
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,260
bit.

278
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,260
Awesome.

279
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,260
Well, we look forward to seeing what you think.

280
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:35,300
Well, Emma, do keep checking in as you're feeling well and joining us because it's good

281
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,300
to hear from you.

282
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,300
We love to have you.

283
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,300
Will do.

284
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,300
Miss you guys.

285
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,860
Glad to see you back.

286
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,920
All right.

287
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,520
Just a couple of items in the old housekeeping this week.

288
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,140
This Friday stream will be the final Friday stream.

289
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,140
Say it ain't so.

290
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:57,860
As we say goodbye to a crazy experiment that will result in a couple of new things that

291
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,900
we're doing.

292
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,480
So we looked at the Friday stream and said, how could we do this a little differently?

293
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,060
We decided to break it up a little bit.

294
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,500
We'll have more information about that soon.

295
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:10,300
Live stream, community Q&A's, things like that, that'll be coming down the pipe.

296
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:15,460
But the first takeaway is come see us on Friday because we have the crew in house this Friday.

297
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,580
If you're listening the week this came out, we'll also release it, of course, over at

298
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,580
Fridaystream.com.

299
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:23,540
It's going to just be a fun show with the crew in house hanging out and we're launching

300
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,380
a brand new feed.

301
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:33,020
We'll tell you all about this later on, but you can find it over at extras.show, extras.show.

302
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:37,660
All kinds of stuff we'll be ending up in, stuff that maybe didn't fit in here, an interview

303
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:43,820
here and there, a random minimum viable podcast we're trying, extra content perhaps from today's

304
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,500
episode of Linux Unplugged, things like that.

305
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,460
That complete keynote from Thomas Cameron from a couple of weeks back, that's in the

306
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,460
extras feed.

307
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:56,260
So we've created a new feed of extra content that doesn't quite fit in the other shows,

308
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,860
but we wanted something that you could subscribe to and just get it easily.

309
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,860
Right.

310
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,220
I mean, you know when you run out of JB shows, you're already caught up on everything for

311
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,220
the week.

312
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,220
What are you going to do?

313
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,220
Now we've got a feed for you.

314
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,220
We don't want you to get the shakes.

315
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,980
Extras.show, that's with an S, extras.show, and it's extras.show slash subscribe.

316
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:15,020
It's just going to be fun, quick stuff in there that gives us an excuse to kind of play

317
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:19,220
around sometimes, including some stuff that we'll do on the live stream with the community

318
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,500
very soon.

319
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,900
So we'll tell you all about that.

320
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:28,460
And a nice, nice bit of news on the Linux Academy core side, transcripts are nearly at

321
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,060
100% now.

322
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,900
These are click along transcripts that make it easy to jump around in the video.

323
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:38,080
And there's a whole new batch of free courses that are available for community members.

324
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:43,300
If you sign up for Linux Academy community, including some cloud fundamentals, AWS security

325
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:50,740
essentials, and Kali deep dive, that's worth going, making the free account just for that

326
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,740
right there.

327
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,740
Tell you what.

328
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,740
So check that out.

329
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,740
That's all over at linuxacademy.com.

330
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:59,980
You can sign up, get a free community account L right here, and our team curates that stuff.

331
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:04,020
So that's why we mention it from time to time, because it's a good deal.

332
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,900
So go check that out, won't you?

333
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,900
And much, much more.

334
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,980
And keep your ears out on that extras feed, because there'll be a lot of cool stuff coming

335
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:18,580
down that feed, extras.show slash subscribe for that feed.

336
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:25,580
Now Mr. Payne, there is a problem out there, and it's getting bigger and bigger by the

337
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,580
day.

338
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,580
It's the only way against, yeah.

339
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,580
Yeah.

340
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,860
Otherwise, Linux would probably be dead.

341
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:35,500
We'd probably be in a world of hurt, and a bunch of different communities are trying

342
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,140
to solve this big problem that everyone listening to this show knows about, and that's the kernel

343
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,500
is a huge project.

344
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,020
It grows in size and contributors every single month.

345
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:48,660
On average, most releases have somewhere between 1,000 and 1,500 developers making contributions.

346
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,580
Yeah, that's Major Hayden.

347
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,420
He's a principal software engineer at Red Hat.

348
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,140
And something on the order of 200 to 300 of those are brand new.

349
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,540
They've never made a contribution to the kernel before.

350
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,260
He's going to be joining us in just a moment.

351
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:08,300
And he's going to talk about a big project they're working on to try to solve this issue.

352
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,020
Major's here to give us some background on this, and it's the continuous integration

353
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,020
project.

354
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:17,580
It's a really cool idea to kind of try to catch the low-hanging fruit with how fast

355
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,140
the Linux kernel is moving.

356
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:23,300
There are some challenges there, and I would say Greg Crow Hartman's got a couple of really

357
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,380
good talks on this particular topic.

358
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:31,540
One of the challenges, I guess the biggest challenge, is that it moves incredibly fast.

359
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:35,020
The project is large and moves fast.

360
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,700
Last I looked, it was the fastest moving open source project that was out there by a good

361
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,940
amount, even way past Kubernetes.

362
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:45,540
I think it does, if you take all the commits that have gone into Kubernetes, that's about

363
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,340
two and a half versions of kernel development.

364
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,340
So that's about two and a half releases worth.

365
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,340
So we're talking fast.

366
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:55,780
Yeah, and so their idea here is, let's come up with something that can monitor this and

367
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,780
send it out across multiple systems, architectures.

368
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,780
Right.

369
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,060
I mean, that's just a wide test base.

370
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,540
The Linux kernel runs everywhere, as we say all the time, and that means you got to test

371
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,540
it everywhere.

372
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,980
And you have tons of different options when you're building it.

373
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,980
Yeah.

374
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,980
Can you imagine doing this by hand?

375
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,980
All right.

376
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,980
I make a couple of changes.

377
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,980
I'm going to go compile that kernel.

378
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,860
I'm going to go distribute it on like six different machines and architectures that

379
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,980
I have to keep in my office to test this, and then I'm going to test it.

380
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:24,180
Come back, wait, see if anything's changed, and then repeat over and over and over again.

381
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:30,420
That statistic, the Kubernetes entire product is two and a half kernel versions.

382
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,420
Yeah.

383
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,420
That's amazing.

384
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,420
Yeah.

385
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,700
And you think of Kubernetes as this massive project, right?

386
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,300
Yeah, there was just that review done of it this week, some security thing, and it took

387
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,300
them months.

388
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:45,700
Yeah, and then you have new contributors, you have subsystems that are on esoteric hardware.

389
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,900
It's really a challenge.

390
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,100
That's where this continuous integration project comes in.

391
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:56,460
This project came about because there's a lot of low-hanging fruit in the kernel that

392
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,900
can easily be tested.

393
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:04,020
There's quite a few things that you can test in a VM or you can test on a physical host,

394
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:08,980
let's say, that are very easy to test internally with just that one machine.

395
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:13,300
And so the question was asked, why don't we make automation that just runs these tests

396
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,220
to catch the low-hanging fruit?

397
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:19,180
Because the idea is we want to take Red Hat kernel developers and not have them go deal

398
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:24,820
with these small, easy-to-fix problems that slow them down and make them have to go find

399
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,820
a solution.

400
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,220
But instead, let's catch these problems before the patch gets merged in the first place.

401
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:34,400
So if someone says, hey, I'm bringing in these 10 patches, and then we find that when they

402
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,620
do that, all of a sudden memory allocation issues pop up, like you can't allocate memory

403
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:44,660
like you could before, or it's just not structured in the way that you want to, then you can

404
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,660
call it out.

405
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,220
Someone could say, oh, there's a bug in there.

406
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:51,460
The nice thing about that is you can find the bug right then when the patch is being

407
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:57,220
proposed instead of later on when quality engineering is taking a look at a lot of changes,

408
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:01,260
not just the kernel, but a whole lot of things that are changing and trying to work backwards

409
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,460
and figure out where the problem was.

410
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:07,620
In our chat with Major, one of the things that he pointed out was that, okay, we can

411
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:12,820
solve this from a technology standpoint, but there's the human factor as well.

412
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,420
And there's a couple of different projects, but the one that the continuous integration

413
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:22,100
project is working with to solve for the human factor is called, was it patchwork, Wes?

414
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,100
Yeah, patchwork.

415
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:27,540
I mean, if you think about it, Linux kernel development is done in its own style.

416
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,580
It's kind of an older style.

417
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,980
You're on the mailing list.

418
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:34,300
And while, of course, there are Git mirrors everywhere, it's kind of secondary.

419
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,660
So you need to get the culture, understand how to interact with that, and you need a

420
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,740
bridge to actually help the tooling work.

421
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,660
There's a few software projects out that help with that.

422
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:48,700
There's a big one called patchwork, and it essentially reads through a mailing list and

423
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:53,220
watches the emails as they come in and tries to figure out which of these patches go together.

424
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:58,940
So a kernel developer might submit a patch and say, okay, I want to change the way this

425
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,940
works.

426
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,340
It takes 10 patches to make this change.

427
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,780
And so they submit all 10 patches to the mailing list.

428
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,020
And then what patchwork will do is go and say, okay, wait a minute.

429
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,340
This was one contribution from one developer.

430
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,460
It has 10 pieces.

431
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,180
These go together.

432
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:17,460
And so then inside the web interface, you can go and look at all these patches together

433
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,460
in one place.

434
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,140
And of course, there's an API as well.

435
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:24,460
So if you have automation, you can actually just pull down the patches or what we call

436
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:29,340
a patch series when patchwork sticks them together into one patch series.

437
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,220
So that way you can test them.

438
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,020
That way you can report back status on them and that kind of thing.

439
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:38,420
But it's a software project completely over on the side from the mailing list.

440
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:41,100
Now think about this for a moment.

441
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,060
They thought they could replace all of this automated stuff.

442
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,500
And they ended up running into this human problem where people have been doing it a

443
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,380
certain way for a long time, have this that works for them.

444
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,620
They got software that archives that it's plain text, it's searchable.

445
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:57,340
They got filters set up that have been working for them for years.

446
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,980
It's part of a workflow.

447
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,740
And you can't deny the kernel is successful.

448
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,020
So obviously it must work.

449
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,020
Yeah.

450
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,460
And I mean, you're not going to change that, right?

451
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,160
I mean, that's established.

452
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,580
So if you're going to build something to work with, that's your only option.

453
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:14,460
Spark is an incredible effort to sort of solve a human problem and automate it at the same

454
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,460
time.

455
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,040
We'll have a link in the show notes if you want to know more about it.

456
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:21,820
And if you'd like us to dig into those kinds of projects, go to linuxunplugged.com slash

457
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,820
contact.

458
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,680
If you'd like us to deep dive into some of that stuff, you definitely can.

459
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:29,820
Now what's great is the way they're doing this, and even though it requires an incredible

460
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:35,100
amount of infrastructure, they need system 390s, they need every various ARM system that's

461
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,100
in production.

462
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,480
They need lots of different Intel and AMD systems.

463
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,180
The end result, hopefully, is improvements upstream.

464
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:48,100
And so as part of this, we asked the question, well, if we do this really well, and we keep

465
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,900
things from getting into the rail kernel that's not supposed to be there, what if we could

466
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,500
do this for upstream?

467
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:58,200
So what if we could do this for an upstream kernel repository of some sort, and not only

468
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,780
be able to catch it earlier, but then catch it in a way such that we can help upstream

469
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:09,580
development and help test and help maintainers actually know what's okay to go in the kernel,

470
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,580
what's not?

471
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,580
Okay.

472
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:17,260
So how many software testers does it need to change a light bulb?

473
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:20,620
None, because software testers don't make changes.

474
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,820
They will just report that there's darkness.

475
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:26,620
There are many, many different continuous integration projects.

476
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,220
And OpenQA is probably another very popular one.

477
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,420
We'll have a link to a talk in the show notes.

478
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,460
This talk is about OpenQA.

479
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,460
The heart of OpenSUSE's automated testing.

480
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,580
I'm Ludwig.

481
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:45,460
I'm employed by SUSE, and still I am one of the engineers behind OpenQA where it is now.

482
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,220
OpenSUSE is a huge project.

483
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,140
And so they're one of many that take advantage of OpenQA.

484
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,140
Yeah.

485
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,140
I mean, think about it.

486
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,040
It's just too complex to test by hand, right?

487
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,300
There's too many little things that can change.

488
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:59,020
You have a giant collection of software to handle.

489
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:02,140
So solving that problem, they introduced OpenQA.

490
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:06,740
One thing that's kind of neat about OpenQA is it replicates things the way a human might

491
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,640
interact with, you know, simulated keyboard and mouse inputs.

492
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:15,020
So you can test a huge range of software that might not be amenable to other testing methods.

493
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,020
Yeah.

494
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:20,340
And Fedora, as we've talked about before on the show, considers OpenQA a, quote, significant

495
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,100
part of their release validation process.

496
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,620
That's one of the great things about open source, right?

497
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,940
I mean, one distribution solves a problem and another one can just take advantage of

498
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,940
it.

499
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,940
No, it is.

500
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,940
It is.

501
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:34,300
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Popey is joining us now, mid-show.

502
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,180
Popey, welcome to the Unplugged program.

503
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:39,380
I know you've messed around with Jenkins a bit.

504
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:43,020
Is there any kind of continuous integration going on over at Canonical for some of the

505
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,180
projects there that you're aware of?

506
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,180
Oh my God.

507
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,180
Tons of it.

508
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,180
Really?

509
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,180
Yeah.

510
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,180
It's all over the place.

511
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,180
Yeah.

512
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:54,400
We use a little bit of Jenkins and we also use something called Spread, which Spread

513
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,940
does all the testing for SnapD across a whole bunch of different distros.

514
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:02,700
So we know that SnapD and Snaps work across different distros before we ship it.

515
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,700
Of course.

516
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,300
It makes perfect sense in the Snap scenario.

517
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,500
And don't we appreciate it.

518
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:12,380
So you have essentially VMs that are running the different distros that Snap could potentially

519
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:16,780
run on and then when a new builds out, it deploys to those and tests to see if everything's

520
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,780
working?

521
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,780
Yep.

522
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,220
Does it for every pull request as well.

523
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,820
So the more active they are, the more of these machines get sped up.

524
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,820
Yeah, they get busy.

525
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,820
That's great.

526
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:30,860
I noticed we had a pull request for the Castor Soundboard project on our Jupiter Broadcasting

527
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:34,340
GitHub from the app image maintainer.

528
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:39,020
And he said, you know, apply this patch to your project and every time you do a build

529
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:44,500
now, I'll just pull it down and I'll automatically build an app image of Castor Soundboard.

530
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,500
Sweet.

531
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,300
Gave us instructions to get it hooked up and then using Travis CI and it'll just sort of

532
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,300
build it for us.

533
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,300
Yeah.

534
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,800
It's a Travis CI pipeline.

535
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:57,140
It's a good example of how you can solve a problem like developing the Linux kernel with

536
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:02,040
this unbelievable amount of problem domain or it can come all the way down to a simple

537
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,420
open source soundboard that we use here in the network.

538
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,820
Yeah, the same techniques work all over the place.

539
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,020
Yeah, it's really, it's, it's, you got to solve these problems at machine speed.

540
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,180
It's really what it is.

541
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:17,140
We use, we use Travis a lot for a lot of the snaps we build and at the recent SnapCraft

542
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:26,440
Summit in Montreal, we had some guys from Travis CI come along because they want to

543
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,820
streamline how they deliver software to the machines that are actually doing the builds

544
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:35,020
because obviously they're spinning up thousands of these machines all day, every day.

545
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:38,620
And you know, it's very noticeable for them when Silicon Valley wakes up and everyone

546
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:43,940
starts committing the code that they've made and all these Travis CI jobs start spinning

547
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,940
up.

548
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,940
That's a lot of workload.

549
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:50,220
They're constantly trying to optimize these machines to start as fast as possible and

550
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:55,220
have all the compilers and all the other build tools, the whole build chain in those machines

551
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,220
as fast as possible.

552
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:00,420
So they spin up and spin down super fast, super fascinating stuff.

553
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,420
It really is.

554
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,420
Yeah.

555
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:05,220
I would imagine to be the kind of thing that if I was still in IT, I'd probably be building

556
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,780
probably the kind of things I'd be standing up now.

557
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:13,420
Totally a tangent thing, but is it just me or do you canonical folk have a lot more of

558
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,940
these sprints these days?

559
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:19,100
It seems like they went from a couple of times a year to all the time, I mean, one a quarter

560
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,100
almost.

561
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,100
Yeah.

562
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,700
Well, yeah, there is a lot of them.

563
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,700
But there's different types.

564
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:29,380
We have engineering sprints, which we tend to have every six months and roadmap sprints,

565
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:37,680
which are every three months and then the snap graph summits, which are like ad hoc.

566
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,940
So yeah, there's a fair number of events going on at the moment.

567
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:43,260
There's a lot of air travel and getting around.

568
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,260
It's good fun.

569
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,260
Good.

570
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,260
I'm glad you don't.

571
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,260
I'm glad you don't mind.

572
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,260
It can be fun.

573
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,260
But you guys do.

574
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,260
You tend to do them in pretty nice locations.

575
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,700
I've been following along on telecast for poppy recently.

576
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,700
It's fun.

577
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,700
It is fun.

578
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:58,580
Is there like a URL you give out for that that people if we should give it out here

579
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,580
on the show?

580
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,060
Oh, that's very kind of you.

581
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,060
Yeah.

582
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,660
If you you have to be a telegram user, a telegram user.

583
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:10,740
But what I did was I exported all of the episodes that I made out and I've put them on by my

584
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,740
website.

585
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:15,940
So there's a recent tweet flow from me about this.

586
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:20,980
But if you just go to T dot me slash telecast with poppy, you'll get you'll get to the channel

587
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,420
where all the telegram episodes are.

588
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:28,420
Learn everything about beer and curry you ever wanted to know and more.

589
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:33,940
You had the most English telecast the other day where you were walking from home to the

590
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:39,780
pub to get picked up by your friends to go get curry and I just was listening.

591
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:44,140
It's so fun because it's like what at most, like seven, 10 minutes ever and sometimes

592
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,140
much less.

593
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,300
So it's like who doesn't have time for that?

594
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,300
That's what I wanted it to be.

595
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:51,420
It's just like ad hoc, just me having a little chat, whatever's on my mind at the time.

596
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:55,940
So I don't have to go through the whole episode effort of creating an episode of something

597
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:59,300
and publishing it somewhere and RSS feeds and all that nonsense.

598
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:03,820
I just press record in telegram and you know, the thoughts come out of my brain, out of

599
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,980
my mouth and into the phone and I give it a preview list and then hit send and that's

600
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:07,980
it.

601
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:08,980
Nothing more than that.

602
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,340
I think you're way ahead of us.

603
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,340
Yeah.

604
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:16,540
Well, so now my last two questions are, are you going to be back on Ubuntu podcast now

605
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:19,020
that you're done traveling or is more traveling ahead?

606
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:22,820
So we just recorded two episodes before I dropped in here.

607
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,100
So yeah, I'm back on.

608
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,500
Martin's out because he's on vacation.

609
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:31,420
So I'm back in and Martin's out and I think in two weeks time we'll have our first one

610
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:34,660
with all three of us back for a while.

611
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:39,460
And then last but not least, um, how, how great is user air turning out?

612
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,420
Did you have any idea how great this would be?

613
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:45,700
I see it as just like three guys chatting and I have no idea.

614
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:50,620
Like when you say, when you say nice things, Chris, when we get nice comments, we also

615
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,620
get horrible comments.

616
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,620
Of course.

617
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,620
Mostly on YouTube.

618
00:27:53,620 --> 00:28:01,180
Can I just say, can I just say, not only have I been making podcasts for 13, 14 years now,

619
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,980
but I've been listening to them for just as long and this is one of my favorite podcasts

620
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:05,980
of all time.

621
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,980
Oh, that's very kind of you.

622
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:10,980
Say Joe, Joe and Daniel put a lot of effort in, oh, come on.

623
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,980
It's always you.

624
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:12,980
I'm nodding my head to him.

625
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:13,980
Always like, yeah, that's right.

626
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,980
That's right.

627
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,840
Well, and I've got kids like he does too.

628
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:23,660
So it's like as Joe calls me centrist dad, my, my wife referred to you the other day,

629
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,300
Pope is that guy who said something about bedsheets.

630
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,900
Oh my God.

631
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,980
It's also, it's like the only show I get to listen to with my wife too.

632
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:32,980
There's that.

633
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:37,340
And I think a big part of what makes it work is Daniel Fore from elementary is willing

634
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:42,520
to take a bit of, as you would say, a piss, like he'll just sit there and he'll just dig

635
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,520
himself in deeper.

636
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,520
He'll take the piss, Chris.

637
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,520
He'll take the piss.

638
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,520
What is it?

639
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,520
I'm sorry.

640
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,520
Not a piss.

641
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,520
Hold on.

642
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,520
Hold on.

643
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,520
Joe came in studio just to correct me.

644
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,520
Hold on.

645
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,520
Yes.

646
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,520
Take the piss, not take a piss.

647
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,520
Okay.

648
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,520
Thank you, Joe.

649
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,520
Hey, Joe.

650
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,520
Joe's here.

651
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,260
We got all, it's a whole family reunion right now.

652
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,780
We're working on a new super secret show, you know?

653
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:05,260
So yeah, yeah.

654
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,260
Very secret.

655
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,380
So we've got, we've got so secret.

656
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:13,060
I even flew drew, drew and, uh, and, uh, L and Joe who haven't been on show.

657
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,060
They're here too.

658
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:17,340
So we've got in studio, we've got cheese and we've got Brent and we've got Alex and it's

659
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,340
a whole JB party.

660
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:21,700
Wes and myself, and we're working on some new secret stuff.

661
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,820
It's very exciting.

662
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:28,820
So one thing I would have to say is if any of the listeners want us to answer any particular

663
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:34,900
question, they just have to let us know with hashtag ask error, ping us in the, the JB telegram

664
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:39,700
or in IRC, you know where to find, just ping any one of us with your crazy questions for

665
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,260
us to ask about life, the universe and everything.

666
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,660
They get some great questions.

667
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:48,500
So whatever medium you like to talk to these guys, hashtag ask error and it'll show up

668
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:53,380
on their radar and then they ponder them in the show and it leads to some of the best

669
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,300
conversation and discussions.

670
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,300
So yeah.

671
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:59,940
Well, Popey, it's good to have you here and thanks for giving us the comical side of that.

672
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,100
That's a, it's interesting perspective on how they use continuous integration.

673
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,140
It makes total sense, total sense for snaps.

674
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:09,500
Well, while we are talking about other great podcasts, you notice we don't do quite as

675
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,780
many distro reviews.

676
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,780
We still do a few.

677
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:16,380
We do like the big benchmark ones, the ones that we can't not do.

678
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:22,500
But if you want a review from folks who just can't seem to scratch that distro hop itch,

679
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,500
check out Choose Linux.

680
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:27,940
Here's a clip from each of them on the most recent distro they randomly tried, which is

681
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,980
one I haven't given a go yet, EndlessOS.

682
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:35,080
I know that we start almost every single distro hop segment with, well, Elle, I see you had

683
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,520
some issues, but not this time.

684
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,820
This time I'm in love.

685
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:44,260
This is what I thought an operating system was supposed to be like.

686
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:49,260
When people tell me about how they use Windows, and it's just simple, and you go and you use

687
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,260
it.

688
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:55,420
I would say that this is the prettiest GNOME retrofit that I've ever seen, too.

689
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,700
It is almost on par with how good Deepin looks.

690
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:04,420
I can see what you're getting at, Elle, but it's just too simple for me.

691
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,420
Hmm, EndlessOS.

692
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:08,620
So it's the man who uses XFCE.

693
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:11,380
Nice, nice.

694
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:14,020
Also shout out to XFCE Project had a release this week.

695
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,020
Shout out.

696
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,020
Whoop.

697
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,020
At ShoesLinux.

698
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:20,020
They're also throwing in a few picks here and there.

699
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,020
I don't know.

700
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,460
I might just stop doing the show and just listen to them.

701
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,940
Yeah, we can learn everything we need.

702
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,940
Mm-hmm.

703
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:25,940
Just listen to them.

704
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,940
All right.

705
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,940
Well, let's do our pick this week.

706
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:32,180
Now, everybody's always talking about their tiling window managers, and I'm like, yeah,

707
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,180
I know about your i3.

708
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:38,100
Yeah, I know about your Awesome, but I like me a traditional desktop environment.

709
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,620
That's always been my go-to line.

710
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:46,060
Well, Wes, today we are going to have our cake and we are going to have it with a delicious

711
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,380
side of ice cream.

712
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,380
That sounds great.

713
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,380
Yeah.

714
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,380
Right?

715
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,700
It's called QuickTile.

716
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,380
Keyboard-driven window tiling for your existing window manager.

717
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,740
I'm sorry, what did you say?

718
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,740
Existing window manager.

719
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,740
Hmm.

720
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:02,300
Well, existing X11 window manager.

721
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,300
So everybody's existing window manager.

722
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,300
Hey, hey now.

723
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,300
Yeah.

724
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,300
I don't know.

725
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:12,660
I don't know, like in Choose Linux, they were reviewing OBS.

726
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,820
And now it's like the reviews are getting to the point where you've got to start making

727
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,820
the OBS disclaimer.

728
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:19,820
Or I mean, I'm sorry, when you're reviewing OBS, you've got to start making the Wayland

729
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,820
disclaimer.

730
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,820
Oh, yeah.

731
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,820
Like a lot of this stuff doesn't work because-

732
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:25,140
Yeah, or on Wayland, it's just, oh, it's going to be rough.

733
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,140
Hey, we're getting there.

734
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,340
We're all very hopeful about Pipewire.

735
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:32,160
So what my plan is is to just hang out on XFCE on X11 for a long time, and I'll just

736
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:37,420
add a little window tiling key binding magic to my XFCE desktop.

737
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,420
With QuickTile.

738
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,420
Yeah.

739
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,420
So that's where QuickTile comes in.

740
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:44,580
It's an analog also to WinSplit.

741
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:47,860
And if you remember that, that was an old school.

742
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:52,500
There was WinSplit and WinSplit Revolution, which were plugins for Compass.

743
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,900
Now if you don't know what I'm talking about, you're-

744
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,180
You got nothing.

745
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,180
You don't know what I'm talking about?

746
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,180
Really?

747
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,180
Oh, my God.

748
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,180
No.

749
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,180
Oh.

750
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,180
Wes, show them the wobbly windows real quick.

751
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,180
Oh, yeah.

752
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,180
I still got the-

753
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,180
So take a look.

754
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,180
Tell me what you think about these wobbly windows.

755
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,180
What do you think of that?

756
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,180
How far is that fun?

757
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,180
What do you think right there?

758
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,180
Yeah.

759
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,180
Or watch what happens when I close a window.

760
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,180
Yeah.

761
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,180
Watch this.

762
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,180
Watch this.

763
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,180
Come on now.

764
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,180
Now, okay.

765
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,180
Honest, your first impression.

766
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,180
Okay.

767
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,180
The wobbly windows I think is super fun.

768
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,180
It sparks joy.

769
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,180
Oh, yeah.

770
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,180
I can't stop smiling.

771
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,180
You're seeing it.

772
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,180
I can't stop smiling.

773
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,180
So I will say I'm a fan of that.

774
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,180
The exploding windows, I don't know.

775
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,180
Yeah.

776
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,180
It felt a little cheesy.

777
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,380
But imagine like you're angry and you want to close something.

778
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,380
Ah.

779
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,380
And you just explode it.

780
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,580
You know what was even better is back in the day they had burn down windows.

781
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,420
You'd close it and it would fire effect and it would burn down.

782
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:40,580
I'd be okay with like turning the old CRT TVs off.

783
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,580
Yeah.

784
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,580
Oh.

785
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,580
That would be great.

786
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:49,540
In Plasma, one of the fun things you can do is you can set it so that your windows gray

787
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:53,180
out when the application crashes, which is kind of a neat effect.

788
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,180
I think I have that in Plasma.

789
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,180
Yeah.

790
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,180
Yeah.

791
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,180
Did you set that up?

792
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,180
Oh, yeah.

793
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,180
No, I didn't set it up.

794
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,180
You could turn on the wobbly windows.

795
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,180
Oh.

796
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,180
Careful.

797
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,180
Yeah.

798
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,180
It's just under desktop effects.

799
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,180
Most of the time.

800
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,180
Right?

801
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,180
Most of the time.

802
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,220
I mean, all those engineers work to build that GPU for something, might as well put

803
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,220
it to the...

804
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,220
I don't even notice anymore.

805
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:14,540
I kind of like I feel bad showing it because the wobble doesn't seem like it's very wobbly

806
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,540
anymore.

807
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,540
You could up the wobble if you want.

808
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,540
Oh, right.

809
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,540
Of course.

810
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,540
It's Plasma.

811
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:22,380
So you could increase the wobble factor if you want to increase the wobble factor.

812
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:29,380
Poppy will not be increasing the wobble factor because he did something that is so 2019 Linux

813
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:34,180
personality that I just I love and also fully appreciate.

814
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:39,580
So on Twitter, which God only knows why he chose to do this, he announced that he was

815
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,460
switching away from Plasma.

816
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:47,100
And then was it six successive tweets explaining how it's okay that you're switching away from

817
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:50,340
Plasma and that everybody else's choices are okay, too.

818
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,340
Yeah.

819
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:57,460
I don't like this whole, you know, internet Zed list celebrity has switched from Distro

820
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:00,900
A to Distro B, the sky is falling rubbish.

821
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:05,660
So I just had to super clarify everything in a complete succession of tweets.

822
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,960
I liked it, though, because you referenced back the first tweet of when you actually

823
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,420
installed KDE Neon.

824
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,420
And what are you on now?

825
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,420
You just on mainline Ubuntu?

826
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:18,660
Yeah, Ubuntu 19.04 with GNOME.

827
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:23,380
What was the was it just time for just trying something else or what was the what was the

828
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,380
impetus?

829
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:27,580
The actual trigger to this was last week's lup.

830
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,580
Oh, really?

831
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:33,660
When you I came in, and my audio was all messed up.

832
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:38,620
I've tried so many things, and I couldn't figure out what the hell it was.

833
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:41,260
So I thought, okay, there's got to be something fundamental on my system.

834
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,260
I don't know what it is.

835
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:45,440
And I don't know who to file a bug against, or what projects file a bug against.

836
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,620
So I decided, right, let's just upgrade to the latest of everything.

837
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:54,940
And if it still happens, then then I can start looking for where the bug is.

838
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:58,700
And it hasn't happened yet, I don't think.

839
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:03,140
Which is partly why I'm here to test that this actually works.

840
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:06,740
I'm wondering if your impression not even necessarily from like a technical level, but

841
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:11,020
my impression is the GNOME audio stack just seems a little simpler.

842
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:14,500
Like it just seems like it's sitting right on top of Pulse and whatever Pulse is doing,

843
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,500
that's what GNOME is doing.

844
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:21,420
So I think part of it is that KDE gives you knobs and buttons to switch, so Plasma gives

845
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,740
you like things you can tweak.

846
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:29,780
And because the GNOME desktop doesn't, it's harder to shoot yourself in the foot.

847
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:34,180
And I think it's entirely possible that I've twiddled something in KDE at some point in

848
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:39,340
the last 18 months, which has made this go bad, and I don't know what that is.

849
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,340
That's possible.

850
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,180
But there are lots of other possibilities as well.

851
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:45,420
Hardware failure, it could be Pulse audio is rubbish.

852
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,540
There's so many things.

853
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:51,840
I can't point the finger at any one thing, but yeah, the audio subsystem on GNOME seems

854
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,700
to be simpler.

855
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,700
You sound great today.

856
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,700
Awesome.

857
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,700
Thank you.

858
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,700
That's what matters.

859
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,700
I can't argue with that.

860
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,700
Yeah.

861
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:03,220
I find that I hop about every nine months now.

862
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,220
It's about my...

863
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,220
Yeah.

864
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,500
It's the problem when all the options are so good.

865
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,500
It's all good.

866
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,740
We're going to do some reloading here in the studio.

867
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:16,100
In fact, we were thinking about having an on-air debate about what we reload to.

868
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:20,980
I'm becoming less and less attracted to nuking and paving a system.

869
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:24,460
So I built an arch system a year ago.

870
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:30,200
It turned one year old on July 27th, and I've got it set up just the way I like it.

871
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,860
And I don't know if this is just because I've now been using Linux for long enough that

872
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:40,680
I can actually troubleshoot my problems sufficiently that nuking and paving is no longer a requirement

873
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:45,540
to get a stable system, or whether it's just because I've become so comfortable in this

874
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:53,580
pair of old, worn-out, comfy shoes that now it's like I just don't feel the desire to

875
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,180
nuke and pave like I used to.

876
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:59,500
I mean, I have a Proxmox server in my basement that I can just spin stuff up on.

877
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:04,100
And my laptop and my desktop are work horses now, and they just need to work.

878
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,100
Sure.

879
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:09,540
There is an element of you have to know enough about a system because half the re-kicks that

880
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:12,820
happen on our team are, we did something weird, and we've got to start again.

881
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:16,180
And if you keep doing it every time, you don't ever quite learn what it was that broke it.

882
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:19,780
But you always have to do that math, like, ah, my time is worth X, Y, Z.

883
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:22,340
I know it'll take me two hours to re-kick this thing.

884
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:29,540
I know it'll take me five hours to troubleshoot it-ish, or more, exactly, exactly, exactly.

885
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:34,600
But Popey said something in one of his recent telecasts with Popey that I had to respond

886
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:39,300
back because he said, Popey, you were talking about upgrades, and how people are always

887
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:43,060
like, we almost have like a wipe and pave or a nuke and pave culture that just sort

888
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,220
of is the default answer.

889
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:48,220
And it's not necessarily always the best way to go.

890
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,980
Sometimes just upgrading for a while actually is the best way.

891
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:58,240
Yeah, I've long lamented the fact that people will say don't upgrade because upgrades are

892
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,980
broken and therefore you should always do a clean install.

893
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:05,140
And I appreciate, you know, sometimes they are broken.

894
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:13,060
And part of the problem here is that people do all kinds of crazy things to their machines

895
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:17,340
and then forget they've ever done that, and then six months later they go to upgrade and

896
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:23,060
something they've done is so fundamental that the upgrade breaks.

897
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:30,500
Now part of that is they then blame us, the distro maintainer, because we make a shonky

898
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:35,260
distro that can't upgrade properly, yet they ripped out core components of the desktop

899
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:38,900
six months ago, but they don't remember because this was just a command they copy and pasted

900
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:43,940
off of a blog somewhere in order to get a new theme or to get a new splash screen in

901
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:44,940
grub.

902
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,100
Yeah, disable system D or something stupid.

903
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:50,300
Or yeah, something ludicrous like that, but they don't know they did it.

904
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,780
Did you hear that I've switched from system D?

905
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,780
It's great.

906
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,780
Troll.

907
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,780
Yeah.

908
00:39:54,780 --> 00:40:00,020
But part of the problem is us in that when we leave people in a really horrible state

909
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:05,620
when an upgrade breaks, you're left with often a black screen or no way to log in.

910
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:10,040
Or if you do log in, your desktop doesn't load properly or something, and that's horrible.

911
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,860
And when you're in that state as a user, what are you going to do?

912
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,380
You're going to nuke and pave and then you're going to get it in your head that that's the

913
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,660
right way to upgrade.

914
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,860
And so it becomes ingrained behavior.

915
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:24,480
And see, for me, this is one of the big advantages of building an Archbox is I know every command

916
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,100
that went into building that thing and I had to go and learn why I'm running that particular

917
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,100
command.

918
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:36,260
Whereas, as you say, copying and pasting something to piping it to shell is very easy and tempting,

919
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:41,140
but it can lead to problems down the road that you just don't foresee because you don't

920
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,300
understand what it is you did.

921
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,920
I mean, I love Arch, so don't get me wrong.

922
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,860
But here's the context for the rest of the audience.

923
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:53,740
Before the show, we were discussing what OS we're going to deploy in the studio after

924
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,440
today's show.

925
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,860
We have a couple of things we just need to address.

926
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:03,100
Some of these machines were either set up as Kubuntu or Neon, and now they're running

927
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:07,500
XFCE, and we just want to do a clean install, so it's just a base system.

928
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,500
Start fresh.

929
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,500
Start fresh.

930
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,980
And we want to do it before there's a lot of issues.

931
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,700
There's a couple of niggly things we've noticed.

932
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:19,180
And then, of course, because it's a group full of Linux geeks, the debate of what distro

933
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,740
we should use has been the number one.

934
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:22,740
I can't make this up.

935
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:23,740
Oh, yeah.

936
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:27,860
No, it really is the serious point of contention.

937
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:33,820
So Alex is advocating for Arch, Drew is essentially advocating for Ubuntu LTS, and I'm on the

938
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:37,780
fence leaning towards Fedora.

939
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,100
You say that, but you want Fedora.

940
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,700
You'll be happy to see Fedora chosen.

941
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,700
Yeah, I would be.

942
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,700
I would be.

943
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,700
More Ubuntu.

944
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:49,180
So I'm going to make my, I'll start.

945
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,420
So Alex just made his case for Arch.

946
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:57,500
I will counter that with, we started with Arch.

947
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,940
We started with Arch.

948
00:41:58,940 --> 00:41:59,940
And now here we are.

949
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:05,340
May I add that one of the additional problems that I doubt Alex has that we would have in

950
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:10,500
the studio is you like to do upgrades immediately before live shows, because that's when you're

951
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,300
here in the studio working on the machines.

952
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,420
There is a little bit of that.

953
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:14,420
And it's fine.

954
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:17,700
Like most, you know, when you do the upgrades, when you have time and a safe space, Arch

955
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,700
is fine.

956
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,700
It's very stable.

957
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:20,700
I've stopped doing that.

958
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:21,700
Okay.

959
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,700
If you say so.

960
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,700
Well.

961
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,700
You got tricked.

962
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:32,100
Okay, maybe I haven't completely 100% stopped, but I've reduced.

963
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,980
I want this to be a soundboard clip.

964
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:34,980
I've moderated.

965
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,260
That three seconds is amazing.

966
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:41,700
No, I think for me, it's like, I've always felt like a little bit of like spitting into

967
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:47,540
the wind, but it is also like me saying my operating system should be able to handle

968
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,540
this.

969
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:53,540
Like, so you probably saw this week that a canonical announced that the absolute latest

970
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:58,180
and greatest version of Ubuntu LTS now has like a nice gooey way to sign up for the live

971
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:03,700
patch service, get yourself an Ubuntu one account, and then you can patch three machines

972
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:07,540
for free and you can do it all through the gooey and then you're secure through reboots

973
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:10,500
for some of the more important ones.

974
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,860
That's super appealing to me in a studio environment.

975
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:18,420
And so initially I envisioned like deploying Ubuntu LTS everywhere, bring it all into landscape

976
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:24,140
using live patch to manage them, and then I started having sound problems, which we've

977
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:27,980
documented and we've resolved for the most case by switching up to Jack.

978
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,620
It's pretty much solved our problems.

979
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:35,980
But now we're sitting here with these systems that are sort of Frankensteined and I've had

980
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:39,820
a lot of experience in the last nine months.

981
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,820
I don't know.

982
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:41,820
How long has it been?

983
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:42,820
Yeah.

984
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:43,820
Six, nine months.

985
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:47,300
Yeah, messing with Fedora and it seems like a very clean, reliable system that has good

986
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:49,460
solid upgrades.

987
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,060
And Drew himself has some good experience with it.

988
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,540
Doesn't hurt that our editor loves it.

989
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:58,140
And between the two of you, like we can pretty much pull anything off with Jack audio.

990
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:02,580
So I kind of feel like maybe it's time to just switch to Fedora and then we have Fedora

991
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,940
on the server and on the systems.

992
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:10,260
And that's the part that appeals to me the most is one common OS, one common environment.

993
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:13,540
The server's running Fedora, my laptop's running Fedora, the studio systems are running

994
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:14,580
Fedora.

995
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:16,180
Everything is the same environment.

996
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:18,580
And you are, I mean, you're kind of the primary admin.

997
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:21,780
You're here in the studio the most, you're using the machines the most, so that's not

998
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:22,780
for nothing.

999
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:23,780
Right.

1000
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:30,380
But I don't want to do it at the expense of software availability or reduced production

1001
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,380
quality.

1002
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:34,140
And so that's where I wonder if Drew has a case for Ubuntu LTS.

1003
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:35,880
So I do.

1004
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:42,760
But before I get to that case, I will say I am already maintaining a group of packages

1005
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:48,580
that do what we need it to do for my own use because I use Fedora on my workstations as

1006
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:49,580
well.

1007
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:50,580
I know.

1008
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:51,960
That's why I think it's funny that you're going to come in here and advocate for Ubuntu.

1009
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:57,220
So I would be comfortable with the studio having Fedora.

1010
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:59,320
To me, it does make sense.

1011
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:07,060
What I like about Ubuntu LTS is the longstanding nature of it.

1012
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:15,380
Fedora 30 is going to be supported until, what, two years after release, right?

1013
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:19,740
And we'd probably bump up to 31 after that arrives.

1014
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:24,060
And it's a lot of upgrading.

1015
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:31,900
And it is targeting a use case that is more agile than a production machine like a recording

1016
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,800
studio to me should be.

1017
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:40,860
I will grant you, going Fedora is conceding that we are getting on an upgrade tread machine.

1018
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:41,860
Yes.

1019
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:42,860
Yes.

1020
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:50,500
So that is why I think the Ubuntu LTS route is probably the better route for a production

1021
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,100
machine.

1022
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,860
Workstations, those can be great and agile.

1023
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:57,020
And that's what I do at home.

1024
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:03,500
But if you want something to be fairly static and work the same way every time, an LTS is

1025
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:06,700
kind of the, to me, it's the right way to go.

1026
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:10,300
And the Ubuntu Studio repositories are fantastic.

1027
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:13,740
They have everything that I put in my Fedora repositories already in there.

1028
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:14,740
So really-

1029
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:16,780
How do people find that repo?

1030
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:23,180
If you just do a search on the Fedora copper for Drew of Doom or Linux Pro Audio, they'll

1031
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,180
find it.

1032
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,180
Because it's actually really nice.

1033
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:26,900
Some of those tools have not been on Fedora before this.

1034
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:29,720
So it's actually really nice that you're doing that.

1035
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,160
So Wes, here's my argument.

1036
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:35,900
My counter-argument, because everything Drew said, can argue with that, absolutely solid,

1037
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:39,060
especially when you add the fact that we could use live patch so we could actually even keep

1038
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:41,220
the system secure without having to reboot them.

1039
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:43,480
That's super attractive.

1040
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:47,100
And I would only need these three systems, it doesn't need to be more than that.

1041
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:52,180
But you're working on Jack in the Box, which is a project to take a lot of the audio routing

1042
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:57,600
and put it inside a Docker container and sort of normalize the desktop in the OS.

1043
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:02,020
And if we were to roll out something like that, it wouldn't really matter.

1044
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:06,840
Yeah, I mean, that is kind of the flip side of we could adopt Ubuntu LTS, but eventually

1045
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:12,060
we will have to upgrade and that's a long, it's going to be a long time, possibly.

1046
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,280
That's good and bad.

1047
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,780
If we do go with Fedora, we're going to get a lot of practice following the upgrade path.

1048
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:21,100
Well, and then also, I think we could probably take advantage more quickly of things like

1049
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:22,100
pipeline as well.

1050
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,100
Right.

1051
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:27,380
So I think it's kind of the difference between what Drew's suggesting and making them really

1052
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:30,540
appliances like things we'd be, you know, you find in a rack you don't futz with.

1053
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:31,540
Right.

1054
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:36,740
And as much as we do use these as a production machine, they're also content sometimes.

1055
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:41,780
And you know, we are still adapting our pipeline, how we do the shows, and we probably are going

1056
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:43,340
to continue doing that for a while.

1057
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:47,140
Part of me wants to use these shows as a way to push forward the most modern way to develop

1058
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:48,140
audio.

1059
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:49,140
Right.

1060
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:52,540
And like, we're doing some super freaking cool stuff with Linux audio right now.

1061
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:54,860
Alex, I know you want to jump in.

1062
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:55,860
I want to give you a chance.

1063
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:56,860
Yeah, I do.

1064
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:02,100
So I've been looking in the fedoraproject.org website whilst you've been talking, and the

1065
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:09,140
average lifespan of a fedora release hovers around the shortest is 330 days.

1066
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:10,780
So just under a year.

1067
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:14,180
The longest is 420 days, and that was Fedora 22.

1068
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:17,940
But on average, it seems to hover around that 380 mark.

1069
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:21,820
So you are, you know, signing up to get on this train of upgrading at least every nine

1070
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:22,820
months.

1071
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:23,820
Yeah.

1072
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:24,820
By the looks of it.

1073
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:25,820
That's what I estimate.

1074
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:32,020
But having to upgrade, it could be a really inconvenient time because these releases come,

1075
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:35,940
they say every six months with Fedora, but they also have a big disclaimer underneath

1076
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:40,780
that says it will be approximately six months depending, it will be done when it's done,

1077
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:42,180
is the disclaimer.

1078
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:44,380
So it could end up shifting slightly.

1079
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:48,220
So it won't be like, okay, it's May Linux Fest Northwest is out of the way, we can safely

1080
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:51,620
upgrade this box now, you might end up having to wait a bit.

1081
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:55,780
So I mean, for me, a rolling distro, you never really have to worry about that kind of stuff.

1082
00:48:55,780 --> 00:49:01,260
I can also see where Drew's coming from, though, with the LTS being a minimum to probably four

1083
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:03,580
years worth of updates and stuff.

1084
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:06,820
I mean, for me, I'd probably go that route, right?

1085
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:10,380
I mean, yeah, 1804 is really in that sweet spot, right?

1086
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,380
It's really good.

1087
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:16,060
And, you know, one other option that hasn't been floated, Centos.

1088
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:19,700
If you're doing everything in a container, it doesn't make it, you're not giving up what,

1089
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:22,980
you know, the thing Chris said, he doesn't want to give up software availability.

1090
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:26,860
If you're doing it on Centos, and everything's in a container, then part of me feels like

1091
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:32,540
I'm like, not participating, like I'm watching Linux on the on the from the benches, if I

1092
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:36,700
if I'm using Centos, you have a laptop for that you have.

1093
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,860
These are production machines that just need to work.

1094
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:41,140
I have a proposition for you, Chris.

1095
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:45,220
How about you do whatever it is you're going to do now.

1096
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:47,740
And then you'll get it out of your system.

1097
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:55,620
And then in nine months time, switch to 2004 LTS, where you can have ZFS on route.

1098
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:58,780
And then you can do snapshots before you do your upgrades.

1099
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:00,420
And then you won't have to worry about it.

1100
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:01,420
There you go.

1101
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:02,420
He has a point there.

1102
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:03,420
It's very logical.

1103
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:07,500
It's very, that is, as, as the good Mr. Spock would say, logical.

1104
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,820
I guess I'm struggling to come up with a reason now.

1105
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:14,580
I think we've made a good case for the LTS, especially since the package availability

1106
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:17,380
is there from the other flavors.

1107
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:23,300
I guess what would you propose is our solution, then, for the variance between production

1108
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:24,300
and workstations?

1109
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:29,140
I mean, we work for a company called Linux Academy, right?

1110
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:31,340
I think it's I think we can solve that problem.

1111
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:36,780
I think it's a good thing to be familiar with multiple different flavors of Linux.

1112
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:37,780
You're right.

1113
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:38,780
You're right.

1114
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:40,900
You know, I mean, as host of Choose Linux, I ought to be right.

1115
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:46,820
But yeah, no, it's I don't I don't see any reason to pigeonhole ourselves into saying,

1116
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:52,420
we run Fedora only or we run Ubuntu only or any.

1117
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:57,540
To me, I like being familiar with multiple different systems and I feel comfortable administrating

1118
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:58,540
them all.

1119
00:50:58,540 --> 00:50:59,540
All right.

1120
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:00,540
So let's do it then.

1121
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:01,540
Let's do.

1122
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:05,420
I think we should use Ubuntu 1804 LTS right here.

1123
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:06,980
That'll be what we reload the system to.

1124
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:10,940
We just got to make sure we make sure it's decent because like there's some some excess

1125
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:14,520
ego in run right now and some of the window management.

1126
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,300
It's just it's kind of bare bones.

1127
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:17,300
What?

1128
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,300
Are you proposing something else?

1129
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:19,300
No, not necessarily.

1130
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:22,620
I'm just saying, you know, we want to make sure it's easy to use windows.

1131
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:23,620
Well, that wouldn't hurt.

1132
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:24,620
Can I can I tell you about it?

1133
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:26,340
OK, we got to make sure we install a dock.

1134
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:27,340
What about QuickTile?

1135
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:28,340
What about using QuickTile?

1136
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:29,340
Yeah.

1137
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:31,940
You know, it is also Python, so we could probably script it, too.

1138
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:32,940
Yeah.

1139
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:33,940
Oh, yeah, you can.

1140
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:34,940
Oh, absolutely.

1141
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:35,940
Yeah.

1142
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:40,940
You've you've whipped together a couple of hacks using XRender, which has been helpful.

1143
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:41,940
We could expand on that.

1144
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:42,940
But you're right.

1145
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:47,380
The XFC does lack some modern window rules and stuff like that that are super nice and

1146
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:48,380
plasma.

1147
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:51,780
We just I'm just saying we just we should think about those things as we go forward.

1148
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:55,140
Thankfully on the LTS, it really doesn't matter what base distribution we just can't we can

1149
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:58,800
mix it up and install this Wesley Wesley Wesley, Ben, you're coming at me.

1150
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,700
You're coming at me with questions, not solutions right now.

1151
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:01,700
I mean, you're to me.

1152
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:02,700
You're just I don't know what you mean.

1153
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:06,460
You mean we can't use Ubuntu like my head's spinning now, like my whole world is falling

1154
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:07,460
apart.

1155
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:08,460
I just want you to trick it out for me.

1156
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:13,820
Adopting a distro like a religion is stupid.

1157
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:14,820
Thank you, Thomas.

1158
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:15,820
Very well.

1159
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:19,660
So what are your feelings on the current iteration of Ubuntu with Gnome as the default?

1160
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:21,260
Like, how do you feel about Gnome these days?

1161
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:23,540
Because I know you've had a actually, I think Gnome looks great.

1162
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:27,020
You know, I don't want to steal anyone's thunder, but one of our team members here is trying

1163
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:28,020
it out.

1164
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:32,300
And I was looking over his or her shoulder and it looks so good, you know, just looks

1165
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,300
so good.

1166
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:37,380
It's just not what I need for production appliance systems.

1167
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:43,220
I actually would prefer nothing has a no compositor, no no special 3D effects, no nothing.

1168
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:44,220
I3 then.

1169
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:45,220
I got it.

1170
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:46,220
All right.

1171
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:47,220
Oof.

1172
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:49,220
Chase, did you hear what he just said?

1173
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:51,300
He said I3 on a production machine.

1174
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:55,820
I'm glad you guys I just was just listening to all you guys hash it out.

1175
00:52:55,820 --> 00:53:01,340
The reality is, is that Drew is right, is that you should use the LTS because.

1176
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:02,340
Maybe we should do I3.

1177
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:03,340
Long term support, fellas.

1178
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:04,340
Hey, what do you think?

1179
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:05,340
Maybe we should we give I3 a go?

1180
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:06,340
Yeah, if you're down, let's do it.

1181
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:08,660
I mean, I3 is great.

1182
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:09,660
Let's give it a go.

1183
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:12,500
And then we'll say we'll give it a review in next week.

1184
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,380
You want to put a cheat sheet on the wall next to you?

1185
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:15,380
Yeah, good call.

1186
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:16,380
Cheat sheet.

1187
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:17,380
All right.

1188
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:18,380
OK.

1189
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:19,380
All right.

1190
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:20,380
Well, we'll see how that goes.

1191
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:21,380
So make sure you tune back next Tuesday.

1192
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:22,380
You can join us live over at jblive.tv.

1193
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:50,340
You can burn it at Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash calendar and see you next Tuesday.

1194
00:53:52,380 --> 00:54:02,100
It's for people who like to mess with computers, if you and you know who you are, if you're

1195
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:03,100
somebody who doesn't want to mess with it.

1196
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:04,100
I just want to surf.

1197
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:09,140
I just want to buy something on Amazon, send an email to my kids, look at some websites.

1198
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:12,240
If that's you, you don't want to mess with it.

1199
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,240
Probably not a good choice.

1200
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:14,780
What was that hesitation before?

1201
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:15,780
Look at some websites.

1202
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:22,340
You know what's funny is Leo actually now is he's a pretty happy desktop Linux user.

1203
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:24,020
That's what I hear.

1204
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:25,900
Neil, how was Flock?

1205
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:28,180
It was awesome.

1206
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:32,380
Aside from being in Hungary, which I've never been to before, which was it was an experience

1207
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:33,380
in itself.

1208
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:37,740
It was great meeting all these people again for another year and seeing a bunch of new

1209
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:39,000
faces do.

1210
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,260
Now this is the old Fedora Developers Conference.

1211
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:44,180
And did you did you get anything accomplished?

1212
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:47,760
Did you achieve any kind of kumbaya on anything that you set out for?

1213
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,220
Like how was that aspect of it?

1214
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:56,680
So from my point of view, the big thing was I wanted to see, you know, how the relationship

1215
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:01,780
between the new RHEL 8 and Fedora is going to work out and like talk with some of the

1216
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:09,380
people about the extra packages for Enterprise Linux for RHEL 8, as well as the Fedora modularity

1217
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:15,120
thing and its downstream RHEL cousin, the application stream stuff.

1218
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:19,480
So that was that was a big chunk of what I was looking toward.

1219
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:23,600
But there was also some great things about how we're going to handle some of the changes

1220
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,820
in the Python ecosystem.

1221
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:29,520
You already know from my previous times being on Live Subplugged, talking about murdering

1222
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:32,600
Python 2 in its sleep.

1223
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:36,860
So there there was that as well as looking forward to the future of where, you know,

1224
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:43,900
in the Python ecosystem is evolving the way that software is developed and shipped and

1225
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:48,700
things like that and stuff like, you know, getting into weeds of it, things like dist

1226
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:50,140
utils and set up tools.

1227
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:54,100
If you're familiar with Python development have been the staple or nearly the requirement

1228
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,580
for everything that's going away as a requirement.

1229
00:55:56,580 --> 00:56:01,220
And that requires that means that a lot of things about how we assume Python software

1230
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:03,660
is shipped has to change.

1231
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,860
And we have the most important part.

1232
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:06,860
Mm hmm.

1233
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:07,860
Did you get sick?

1234
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:08,860
No.

1235
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:09,860
Yeah.

1236
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:10,860
Ladies and gentlemen, congratulations.

1237
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:11,860
Congratulations.

1238
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:12,860
That's moving on.

1239
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:20,620
You know, next your next level conferencing now, Neil, that's what that means.
