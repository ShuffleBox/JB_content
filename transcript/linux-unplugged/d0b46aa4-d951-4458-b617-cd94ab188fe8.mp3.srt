00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,240
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's phoning it in for the holidays.

2
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,240
My name is Chris.

3
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,240
My name is Wes.

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,240
Oh, I tease.

5
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,880
Actually, Wes, I'm pretty excited about today's episode.

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,880
You should be.

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,880
Thank you.

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,480
We have some good stuff lined up.

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,640
We're going to do a retrospective of some of the more relevant topics we covered this

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,640
year.

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,440
Like I was teasing previously on the pre-show, this is the episode that makes everybody sound

12
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,440
really smart.

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,320
I just take their best bits and we throw it into this week's episode.

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,320
Because they're awesome.

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,320
We love our audience.

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,340
Yeah, and then when we come back on the week after Christmas, we're going to look back

17
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,880
at some of these topics and we're going to look forward to 2016 as well.

18
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,120
So I think we have a pretty good show lined up, so stick with us for our special holiday

19
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,320
episode here on the Linux Unplugged program that we have created and crafted just for

20
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,320
you.

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,080
If you've never listened to Linux Unplugged before or if you've been listening for the

22
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:08,520
entire 2015 year, there is something in this week's episode of the show.

23
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,520
So thank you very much for tuning in.

24
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,800
And while we're still in the intro, let's bring in that Mumble Room.

25
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,080
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

26
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,080
Hello.

27
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,080
Happy holidays.

28
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,080
Happy holidays.

29
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,080
Happy holidays.

30
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,080
Happy holidays, guys.

31
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,080
Thank you for joining us.

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,280
So we got something that came in on the mail.

33
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,440
Came in, knock, knock on the door.

34
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:31,960
Before we started the show, we got a brand new package that came in and we thought, what

35
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,960
the heck is it?

36
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,320
Was it a Christmas gift?

37
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,800
Was it a Kwanzaa gift?

38
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,800
Surprise.

39
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,960
And I started, it's funny, the box actually said, tear it open.

40
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,160
That's what the box says on the front of it.

41
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,160
Tear into it.

42
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,640
And I'm like, well, that's a challenge.

43
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,640
All right.

44
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,640
Yes, it is.

45
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,640
So I began to rip the box open.

46
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,720
I pulled it out and something very orange emerged from that box.

47
00:01:51,720 --> 00:02:04,000
I think it's called the Kano and we're going to talk about this.

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,040
So the Kano appears to be a computer kit built for kids.

49
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,280
It has a Raspberry Pi as its brain.

50
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,760
And Wes, we have it right here in studio.

51
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,040
And I was thinking, you know, it comes with this keyboard.

52
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,160
It comes with this nice acrylic case.

53
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,160
It's got a touchpad.

54
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,120
It's got all the cables you need.

55
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,760
This is like, if you wanted to give a Raspberry Pi to a kid, it comes with the stickers.

56
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,600
Like this is legitimate, like very compelling for a kid and the packaging is like Christmas

57
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,600
ready.

58
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,600
I mean, it's all you could ask for.

59
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,240
This is a kid for like a cool, fun, tech gift.

60
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,600
Seriously, this is like a Raspberry Pi for the holidays.

61
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,480
It comes with a speaker so you can make it a podcast player or an MP3 player.

62
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,960
My parents have Windows 10 on the desktop, but I want my own system.

63
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:50,280
It comes, look at this, comes with the HDMI out, comes with the USB wireless keyboard with

64
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,280
a touchpad.

65
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,280
Yeah.

66
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,280
It's got the wire there too.

67
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,280
Look at this thing.

68
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,280
Dang, son.

69
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,280
I know.

70
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,280
This is a...

71
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,280
And the Rubik's cube?

72
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,280
Does it come with that?

73
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,280
All right.

74
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,280
All right, Wes.

75
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,280
So here's the challenge.

76
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,680
I want you to open this thing on the show live and give us your impressions of it, but

77
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,440
don't ruin it in case I want to give it to my kids.

78
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,440
They don't listen, right?

79
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,440
To none of your shows, I would hope.

80
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,440
No, not yet at least.

81
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,440
Not yet.

82
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,440
Maybe one day.

83
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,560
So yeah, it looks like a pretty nice box and oh, look at this.

84
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,240
The box actually has an illustration on it.

85
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,240
It's beautiful.

86
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,320
It's got the Raspberry Pi laid out.

87
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,480
This is a really nicely done packaging for this thing.

88
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,960
Oh, look at that.

89
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,960
Okay.

90
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,960
All right.

91
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,960
It's a little nicer than I expected.

92
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,960
Do you need anything to cut?

93
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,960
Do you need a...

94
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,960
I do.

95
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,960
You got keys on you, Wes?

96
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,960
No, you took your keys out of your pocket.

97
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,960
I took my keys out.

98
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,960
Wes!

99
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,960
I'm an amateur.

100
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,960
Use this pen.

101
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,960
Use this pen.

102
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,960
I could probably cut it with the Onion Omega over here.

103
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,880
Don't use the Onion Omega, Wes.

104
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,440
Don't use the Onion Omega.

105
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,680
This is really something.

106
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,960
And their website is us.kano.me.

107
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,960
There we go.

108
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,560
That is a premium lid.

109
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,560
Wow.

110
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,400
I wish we had the camera on for this episode.

111
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,600
It is...

112
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,800
I don't know how to describe this.

113
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,800
Wes is...

114
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
The smell?

115
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,800
Sublime.

116
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,800
Let me see.

117
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,800
Yeah, that does smell good.

118
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,800
So you open it up.

119
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:09,300
It has a pouch on the roof of packets with a one, two, and then underneath it, it has...

120
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,300
And this is all premium.

121
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,800
I mean, it's like nice, heavy, matte cardstock.

122
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,800
Yeah.

123
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
Then down here, look at this poster.

124
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,840
That is super gloss.

125
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,960
They have like a thick poster paper here.

126
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,960
Nice foam insert.

127
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,960
It says, keep this card.

128
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,240
You've built your computer.

129
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,680
Oh my God.

130
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,680
Okay.

131
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,720
This keyboard is amazing.

132
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,720
This is...

133
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,320
The keyboard is bright orange.

134
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,320
It's wireless.

135
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,720
It has a built-in trackpad.

136
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,720
It is...

137
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,300
It feels...

138
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,800
This is really well done.

139
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,040
I want that keyboard for just my own use.

140
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,000
Look at that Raspberry Pi.

141
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,560
Look at that in there.

142
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,560
That is...

143
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,800
This is...

144
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,200
This is super neat.

145
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,960
This is really well done.

146
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,960
So here's the keyboard.

147
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,960
Here's...

148
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,960
It's got an HDMI cable.

149
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,960
What's this right here, Wes?

150
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,960
Is that just USB there?

151
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,960
That is a...

152
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,960
For charging?

153
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,960
Yep.

154
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,960
USB, micro USB.

155
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,960
And then here's the speaker you can add on right there, which looks really nice.

156
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,960
And what do you have there?

157
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,960
What is that red...

158
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,960
I don't know.

159
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,960
Oh.

160
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,960
Is that a power adapter?

161
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,960
Oh, yeah.

162
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,960
It's a power adapter.

163
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,960
Sure.

164
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,960
Sure.

165
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,960
Sure.

166
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,960
Yeah.

167
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,960
So you can power the Raspberry Pi.

168
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,960
So this is everything you need about the screen to make the Raspberry Pi a full-fledged computer.

169
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,960
Oh, and it comes with here a US adapter.

170
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,960
Yeah.

171
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,960
The suitable power adapter for yours.

172
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,000
So if you have a display that works with HDMI, this is everything you need.

173
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Which is what?

174
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Just about everything these days.

175
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,880
This is literally everything you need to make the Raspberry Pi a full-fledged computer.

176
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,960
And then you put Ubuntu Mate on there and you're good to go.

177
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,960
Right?

178
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,960
I mean, and this is like a whole sandbox.

179
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,720
You can let your kid, your teen, like whatever, right?

180
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,720
You.

181
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,720
You can have a whole separate thing.

182
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,720
You don't break it.

183
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,720
This is...

184
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,720
Look at this keyboard.

185
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,720
I mean, this is...

186
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,760
That right there is really something.

187
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,400
So they sent this into the studio and this is remarkable.

188
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,400
Yeah.

189
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,080
Wes is smelling right now.

190
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,720
It has that new computer smell, right?

191
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,760
I love it.

192
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,760
So it's Kano.

193
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,860
The trackpad feels really nice.

194
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,000
It comes with really easy books.

195
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I think this is gonna...

196
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,760
I think this is gonna go under the Christmas tree this year.

197
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,840
That is really cool.

198
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,440
And you know, just a couple episodes ago, we were talking about these small computers.

199
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,280
Wimby, you might have yourself a whole bunch of Ubuntu Mate computers under the Christmas

200
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,960
tree this year if this takes off.

201
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,960
This is really impressive.

202
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,960
Is there an SD card in there, too?

203
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,960
Yeah.

204
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,920
Are they Pi 1s or Pi 2s?

205
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,760
I think it's a Pi 1, but I don't know.

206
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,760
Oh, no.

207
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,760
I take it back.

208
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,760
No.

209
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,760
No.

210
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,760
It is a Raspberry Pi 2.

211
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,760
Excellent.

212
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,880
It is a Raspberry Pi 2 and it comes with an SD card with the Kano...

213
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,880
Look, it's a branded SD card.

214
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,880
Ooh.

215
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,840
With a cute guy with a nice little, like, bowl cut.

216
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,840
Yeah.

217
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,840
It's a nice...

218
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,840
Like, it's not like a...

219
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,840
Wait a minute, Wes.

220
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,840
Look at that.

221
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,840
It has micro SD in there.

222
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,840
Pull that micro SD out.

223
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,840
How big is that micro SD storage there?

224
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,560
What does it say?

225
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,560
Can you see the space on there?

226
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,560
SanDisk.

227
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,560
Do you see the space on there?

228
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,560
Eight gigs.

229
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,480
So it comes with an eight gig micro SD card.

230
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,760
You know, if you already have, let's say, 64 gigabyte for your camera, et cetera, you

231
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,760
just give that to your kid.

232
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,760
He has a full thing.

233
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
Holy crap.

234
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,200
Oh, we should take a picture of that.

235
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,960
That is a cute SD card adapter.

236
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,960
Yeah.

237
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,960
They really put all the final nice touches on this.

238
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,400
The keyboard is very high quality.

239
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,400
The acrylic case is really, really nice.

240
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,400
It's really strong.

241
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,080
It includes a USB wireless dongle.

242
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,760
Look at this tiny USB wireless dongle.

243
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,760
Whoa.

244
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,760
Look at that.

245
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,840
It includes that too.

246
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,840
This is remarkable.

247
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,040
This is going under the Christmas tree.

248
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,060
This is really something, which is great.

249
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,060
This is just great.

250
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,740
And this seems like such a good gift for someone like you're an aunt or an uncle, and maybe

251
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,280
you don't see this kid so much, but you know that they're kind of interested in this area.

252
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,400
You don't have time to maybe spend with them all the time, but you just want to set them

253
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,400
on the right path.

254
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,920
That is really neat.

255
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,920
That is something.

256
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,920
Huh.

257
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,920
But yeah.

258
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,920
There you go.

259
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,920
That's pretty neat.

260
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,040
And we just a little live unboxing right here on the Unplugged show.

261
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,880
You know, guys, one of the things that was a big topic this year that was something that

262
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,600
was fun, we talked about it as a here is a crowdfunding project.

263
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,760
It started as like I think it was Indiegogo, I don't recall.

264
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:57,640
It starts as an Indiegogo, becomes a key point to developing applications for the GNOME desktop.

265
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:02,920
The guy gets a job at Red Hat now, and now it's part of like the XGD app spec to make

266
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,960
portable applications for the Linux desktop.

267
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:11,160
I'm talking about GNOME Builder, and we discussed GNOME Builder on episode 76 of the Unplugged

268
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,160
program.

269
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,400
Matt, I'm going to try giving a guest a call.

270
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,400
Let's see if...

271
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,400
All right.

272
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,400
Hey, Christian, can you hear us?

273
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,400
Yeah, I can hear you.

274
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,400
Can you hear me?

275
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,400
Yeah, we hear you great.

276
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,400
Sure can.

277
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,400
Thanks for coming on the show.

278
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
So Matt, this is Christian.

279
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,400
He's working on GNOME Builder.

280
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,400
Awesome.

281
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,400
And you're probably familiar.

282
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,400
We've talked about the Indiegogo project that's going on.

283
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,840
Christian, welcome to Linux Unplugged.

284
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,840
Thanks.

285
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,840
Thanks for having me.

286
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,840
Oh, no, no problem.

287
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,400
Congratulations, by the way, on the success of the GNOME Builder project.

288
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,680
That seems like that Indiegogo has probably gone better than you expected, I would imagine.

289
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,680
Yeah.

290
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,440
I mean, significantly better than I expected.

291
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:50,520
I tried to set some pretty ambitious goals, but at a very, very reasonable price point.

292
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:56,120
And I'm hoping that people saw that and really came out to help.

293
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,780
Well, what struck me about it is you seem like maybe you're a crazy person because you

294
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,640
quit your full-time job to do this.

295
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,640
Why take that risk?

296
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,280
And you did that even before you launched the fundraiser.

297
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,280
Yeah.

298
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:13,400
You know, I've been a part of the free software community for a long time.

299
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:20,600
And at some point, I decided that fixing the tools that we're all using is far more important

300
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,960
than individual career growth to me.

301
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,120
So I had a pretty kickass job, too.

302
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,680
I was working at MongoDB, working on their C driver.

303
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,160
And it's a great group of people there.

304
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,680
They really care about free software.

305
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,400
There's a reason why the products say GPL licensed.

306
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,480
But ultimately, this was the most important thing I could be doing.

307
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,320
So I really had to make the switch.

308
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,940
That's very impressive and very admirable.

309
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:50,520
So when you launched the fundraiser, has the scope of what GNOME Builder is going to include

310
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,000
expanded quite a bit since the funding kicked in?

311
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,560
Well, you know, it really determines how much and for how long people are willing to support

312
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,560
me.

313
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,600
Like, yes, I want all of these features in there.

314
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,440
You know, I knew that for me to be able to be successful with this, the most important

315
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,860
thing I can do is build Builder with Builder.

316
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:17,240
So that meant the first priority is C. And so we need C. Builder has to be written in

317
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,100
C for technical reasons.

318
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,160
We want to reuse as much of the software as we can.

319
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,160
We want to reuse Glade.

320
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,160
We want to reuse Dev Help.

321
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,120
We want to reuse Git G, GTK Source View.

322
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,960
And all these things are best integrated from C.

323
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,840
So that didn't mean that we don't want to support VALA, you know.

324
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,280
It doesn't mean we don't want to support Python or JavaScript or any of these other languages

325
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,960
in a first-class way.

326
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,320
It just means that, like, our priority had to be this first.

327
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,080
So I knew that a lot of people would really care about those languages, and I really want

328
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,080
to support them.

329
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,840
It just, you know, it can't be the first thing to be done.

330
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,920
We can't, you know, put the cart before the horse.

331
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,920
Right.

332
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,920
That makes sense.

333
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,760
So I think that means that you get that right, and then once you get that right, you move

334
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,000
on from there.

335
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,880
But this looks like maybe, is it going to become a general IDE for GNOME eventually,

336
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,720
like all kinds of languages in there, all kinds of support?

337
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,640
I mean, that is certainly my goal.

338
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:12,680
You know, I don't care what language you write GNOME software in, and most of us don't.

339
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,400
So anything I can do to bring more people in and more people contributing, I'm perfectly

340
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,640
happy to do that.

341
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,120
You know, we already have basic support for some of these languages.

342
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,000
You already get, like, Air Reporting for VALA.

343
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,160
You already get Air Reporting for Go if you have, like, a working Go set up.

344
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,840
So you know, even beyond GNOME, someday that's quite possible.

345
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,600
But I definitely want to stay focused myself on, like, how do we build GNOME software better?

346
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,240
Yeah.

347
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,480
And it seems like this would be a great tool for when somebody asks the question, where

348
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,720
do I get started?

349
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:47,000
People can say, okay, get started with Builder and go from there, which is, it seems like

350
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,900
such a simple thing to be able to say, but we have lacked that one coherent answer for

351
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:54,040
so long that I've talked to a lot of developers who've been put off by that.

352
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,200
It just seems like there's so many choices.

353
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,280
And this represents, well, if you're going to go GNOME, if you're going to do GTK, start

354
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,280
here.

355
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,240
Now, that itself is a huge goal.

356
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,680
And so I'm pretty impressed that you've raised $42,000.

357
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,600
But what happens six, seven, eight months from now?

358
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,720
This is your full-time job.

359
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,080
That funding sort of begins to wane.

360
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,520
How do you make it ongoing?

361
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,520
What's the trick there?

362
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:23,200
Yeah, I mean, I think a really important thing is to, number one, build a really strong community

363
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,760
so we can all share the burden.

364
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,160
But on the point that you mentioned there of having a single answer to tell people,

365
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,920
that is really, really important.

366
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,080
For my time spending helping people get started in free software, almost always the first

367
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,360
question is, how do I get started?

368
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,360
And it's a really monumental thing to get over.

369
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,560
And you look at something like Android or whatever, you know, they have an IDE that

370
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:50,160
you install, and there's other choices, but there's a blessed sort of way.

371
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,400
And you enable developer mode on your phone.

372
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,440
I'd really like to see that in terms of GNOME, you know, where you're just able to enable

373
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,240
developer mode in the control settings, and then all of a sudden you have a complete development

374
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,240
environment.

375
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,600
And everything else is done underneath the hood, and you don't have to worry about it.

376
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,480
So would a goal of yours be maybe to have Builder almost kind of considered a part of

377
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,160
a GNOME desktop, maybe like in developer mode, where it's almost under the branch of GNOME?

378
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,160
Absolutely.

379
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,160
Fascinating.

380
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,240
I mean, this is, I think, I contributed.

381
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,840
I think it's just a great project initiative, and we'll have a link in the show notes.

382
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:28,720
So Christian, I guess you're already working now, so does anything change for you now that

383
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,800
this is successful, or are you just plowing on forward?

384
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:36,660
Well, you know, the last couple of weeks I've been so busy with fundraising and communicating

385
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:41,120
with people, and so the amount of code I've gotten written in January is significantly

386
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,400
less than all of the other months.

387
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,560
So I'm really looking forward to just, you know, putting the blinders on and writing

388
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,560
code again.

389
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,560
Yeah, absolutely.

390
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,400
GNOME Builder has seen a lot of attention since we covered it in episode 76.

391
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,760
And Wes, do you have any thoughts on it since that episode?

392
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,440
Now, here we are at the end of the year.

393
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,280
Only that I'm really excited for the future of a nice GNOME native Python IDE.

394
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,280
Yeah.

395
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,520
You know, I mean, I use Vim pretty much for everything, but a lot of my coworkers, they're

396
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:13,160
using Sublime, they're using Atom, Visual Code, there's a lot of options these days.

397
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,520
And I think GNOME needs something, and I think Python is used by, you know, it's installed

398
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,520
by default.

399
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,320
In a lot of places, GNOME is installed by default.

400
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,720
So I'm excited in this new year to try out GNOME Builder.

401
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,720
There you go.

402
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,800
And I think that what I'm excited about is that it's given a lot of people like, hey,

403
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,960
I want to create a desktop application, I want to use GTK.

404
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,960
Something to target.

405
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,960
What's my entrance path?

406
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,960
Exactly.

407
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,960
Yeah, I do like that quite a bit.

408
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,960
All right, now, I want to move forward to something that was very exciting, very fun

409
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,560
for us on episode 79 this year.

410
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:44,280
It was the episode we did right before the new BQ Phone actually went on sale.

411
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:48,000
Popey joined us and he went in depth on some of the stuff around it, and we just had a

412
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,720
great discussion around the new launch and what people should expect about what we're

413
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,800
all really here gathered today to talk about.

414
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,880
And that's this new BQ Phone that goes on sale next week.

415
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,600
It's like around 170, I think, what is that?

416
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,080
Probably like 100, I don't know, about $175.

417
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,360
I don't know what it's going for exactly, US.

418
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,280
And there's even a little video.

419
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,400
Now, I don't think there's a lot of words in this video, so I'll just, I'll just put

420
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,680
it up on the stream so we can look at it.

421
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,760
I mean, it's definitely a very fancy video.

422
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,960
After all of the waiting, I mean, I know it's only been a couple of years, but it feels,

423
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,200
I mean, that's a long time.

424
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,440
In the scheme of developing something like this, that's not actually a long time, but

425
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,840
for people sitting on the outside, it feels like a long time.

426
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,000
And so this video is extremely well done.

427
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,200
Popey, I don't know if, do you know any of the background on this video?

428
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,200
Like this is-

429
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,040
No, the first time I saw it was last Friday.

430
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:42,600
It was shown off at an event in London and I'd never seen it before.

431
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,080
And actually, the bits where you see outside that go on top of a building is actually on

432
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,720
top of our office building.

433
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,600
I can recognize certain parts of London in the video.

434
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,520
I think, and we'll have the video linked in the show notes, I think one of the things

435
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:01,400
the video does really well for me is it's essentially, without being too obvious about

436
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:07,240
it, showing me kind of how Ubuntu Touch would sort of fit in with the ideal daily lifestyle

437
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,920
that of course nobody truly lives.

438
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:13,600
But if you live that, like I get like contextual information becomes available to me just by

439
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,600
watching that commercial.

440
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,720
Like it's surprisingly effective.

441
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,200
Life at your fingertips is the slogan.

442
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,480
That's pretty good.

443
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,280
This is really well done.

444
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,280
I think so.

445
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,280
I think they did a nice job with it.

446
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,260
I think it's going to be interesting to see where it goes to.

447
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:33,120
So the Aquarius E4 5, 4.5, it's 4.5 inch screen, huh?

448
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,960
Well, so there you go.

449
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,680
So the BQ phone, it's not like, it's not a screamer of a phone.

450
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,440
It's not going to blow you away with its stats.

451
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:47,080
It's got a 4.5 inch screen, runs at 540 by 960 resolution, 1.3 gigahertz quad core ARM

452
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:53,280
Cortex A7 MediaTek CPU, a Mali 400 GPU at 500 megahertz, again MediaTek, 8 gigabyte

453
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:59,240
EMC storage, 1 gigabyte of RAM, 2150 mil amp battery, dual micro SIM, and 8 megapixel

454
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,160
rear shooter.

455
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,720
As far as first goes, it's not bad, especially if you consider that for a certain sector

456
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,920
of the market, that's plenty phone.

457
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,440
I think anyone coming into the smartphone space for the first time is going to be pleasantly

458
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,440
surprised.

459
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,520
And I think that's really where they're going to hit their sweet spot.

460
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,520
That's where I would target.

461
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,880
I think that seems like that's what they're doing.

462
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,560
Now it's not launching in the US yet.

463
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,560
But it is available.

464
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,560
It'll be available.

465
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,520
I wonder if I'll still be able to buy it.

466
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:36,800
So the event that happened last Friday, there were 30 people invited from various places

467
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,800
around the world.

468
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,760
Yeah, it was called the Insiders event, the Ubuntu Insiders.

469
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,460
They were actually invited a couple of months ago.

470
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,720
We built a list of people that we thought might be interesting to come along and see

471
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,720
it.

472
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:55,880
And there was a couple of journalists, a couple of video bloggers, and some like blogger bloggers,

473
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:02,240
quite written bloggers, and members of our community, developers, and what you might

474
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,480
call outsiders from the community.

475
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:12,600
Just come along and we give them a phone and they get to be the first people with one of

476
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,600
these devices.

477
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:19,300
We also gave them a few little tidbits of information over the month leading up to it.

478
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:25,240
And then we flew them out to London on Friday and they came and saw that video and a couple

479
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:31,240
of talks by, there was a guy from BQ there, there was a couple of people from Canonical

480
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,200
giving talks.

481
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,200
It was really good fun.

482
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,760
And they got to leave with a phone, right?

483
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:42,920
Yeah, we gave them all a phone and it was in a special origami presentation box.

484
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:49,040
There was a phone and a pair of nice headphones.

485
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:53,840
It even warranted the Ubuntu phones first official unboxing video, which OMG Ubuntu

486
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,880
picked up and ran.

487
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,880
Had a bunch of phone boxes.

488
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,760
Slick, I got to say, that's a nice looking box.

489
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,920
It was funny.

490
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:05,240
We were asking them, look, do you mind if we video you opening because we know what

491
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,240
it's like.

492
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,000
People want to see the thing unboxed.

493
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,080
And so the video that you're showing now of, that's Jordan Keys unboxing his, he actually

494
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,120
ran back to his hotel room or ran back to another room in order to do that.

495
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,920
And then we went out for beer in the evening while his video was rendering out.

496
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,920
And then he uploaded it to YouTube when he got back after a few beers.

497
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,920
Good sport.

498
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,920
Good sport.

499
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,920
It was good.

500
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,920
It was a good day.

501
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,360
I noticed too, I noticed that they come with a, the Insiders Edition came with a very nice

502
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,280
set of just headphones, like an extra perk there.

503
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,280
It's really cool.

504
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,280
Yeah.

505
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,860
Yeah, we wanted to give them a little bit of something extra to say thank you for taking

506
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:46,120
part and, and, you know, coming all the way to the UK.

507
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,680
I mean, some of them flew over, some of them didn't have fast come, but it was nice of

508
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,000
them to come over and just take part and, and give us feedback as well.

509
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,440
You know, we've been capturing feedback from them.

510
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,720
It, you know, I was walking around on a Friday with a notebook, old style paper notebook,

511
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,280
and people were saying, Hey, what about this?

512
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,280
And how does that work?

513
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,560
And why is this like this?

514
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:09,920
And I was making lists and, you know, I've been giving feedback to developers and filing

515
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:14,040
bugs, like, you know, doing all the due diligence because these are the first people that have

516
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,080
seen them outside Canonical.

517
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,080
We've all seen it evolve.

518
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,640
You know, I've had one of those phones since August last year.

519
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,600
And I use it every day, but there are things you just don't notice.

520
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,960
And then when someone walks up to you and goes, Oh, why, why is it doing allowing me

521
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,960
to do this?

522
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,960
And you think, Oh, wow.

523
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,960
Yeah, you're right.

524
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,960
Yeah.

525
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,960
Yeah.

526
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,960
It's just something because you use it every day.

527
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,960
You just don't think that's weird.

528
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,960
You shouldn't do that.

529
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,960
Yeah, very much so.

530
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,960
That is very true.

531
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,520
So, so actually they, they go on sale as a flash sale starting tomorrow, which is Wednesday,

532
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:47,320
the 11th of February at eight, uh, eight o'clock UTC.

533
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:52,180
So it's nine central European time, only going to be available for a limited time or suckers

534
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,180
like me.

535
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:56,480
Are we going to be able to buy it or is it only going to be, is it a regional day?

536
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:02,080
So it's nine, nine, the central, uh, European time until six central, so eight till five

537
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,080
UTC.

538
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,380
Um, so yeah, it's a fairly lengthy amount of time throughout the day.

539
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,640
It's not like, you know, a 10 minute flash sale.

540
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,840
It's not like the whole world has to DDoS.

541
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,720
So I might actually get one for the day.

542
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,720
You could try, I have a shot.

543
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,720
Yeah.

544
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,720
I'm certainly going to bed early so I could get up.

545
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,800
It's like Christmas for me tomorrow cause I'm going to be ordering one obviously.

546
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,800
Yeah.

547
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,520
Um, you know, we're, we're all going to be ordering them.

548
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,080
Are you pretty excited?

549
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:32,440
Yeah, it's, it's, you know, the fact that, you know, I started working at Canonical three

550
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:37,440
years ago knowing that this was going to happen and it's taken a long time for us to get here.

551
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,680
And we've, you know, we've had a lot of flack along the way and the method by which we've

552
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:49,000
developed this and the software choices that we've made and the, the hardware specification

553
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,280
of the first device, you know, this is, remember, this is the first Ubuntu phone, uh, hopefully

554
00:21:54,280 --> 00:22:01,080
one of many devices, you know, if we come back on, um, unplugged episode 600, there'll

555
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,680
be, you know, a plethora of these phones out there, who knows, you know,

556
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,120
Are you already looking at the next device a little bit?

557
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,120
Cause I know they,

558
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,120
Yeah, yeah.

559
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,120
We've already said the next one is the Meizu.

560
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,120
Yeah.

561
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,320
It's going to be a little more, uh, like a larger screen, right?

562
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,320
One thing.

563
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,320
And, uh,

564
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,320
Yeah, it's, uh, yeah.

565
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,680
It's quite a bigger screen and more, it's, uh, more cores, more RAM, you know, more and

566
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,680
bigger of everything.

567
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,140
But, um, yeah, the moment we're just totally focused on the BQ1.

568
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:29,160
How important was it, uh, you know, you mentioned that you've had one iteration of this, another

569
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,320
since August.

570
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,680
Is that part of why, you know, you got to start and you kind of have to lock in the

571
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,840
specs at someplace and then start developing for that.

572
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:41,080
And so, uh, this, the BQ phone, it's sort of been locked in for a while, I take it.

573
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,080
Yeah.

574
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,080
Right.

575
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,440
And so we initially were, you know, we've had loads of different hardware over the time

576
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,440
that we've developed this.

577
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:53,280
We started off with a tablet edition on an Asus transformer TF-101 and we've moved through

578
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,920
very, uh, Nokia N9 and various Samsung galaxies and nexus devices.

579
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,600
And you know, then we got a partner in BQ.

580
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,720
So we grabbed a bunch of those devices and we started doing the hardware enablement and

581
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,640
making sure all the apps work because, you know, if we've been focusing on the Nexus

582
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,400
4, then we discover that, oh, actually certain dialogues don't fit on the screen.

583
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
I was wondering about that.

584
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,000
Because this thing's slightly different.

585
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,520
So we have to make sure all our apps and the dash is responsive and, you know, scales down

586
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,400
to devices of this size.

587
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,240
And it's actually made us more disciplined.

588
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,640
Having a device that has more constrained hardware resources is probably better for

589
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,640
us.

590
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,920
If we'd have had the MX4 first and had, you know, octo core with two gig of RAM, we could

591
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:40,720
have gone nuts and, you know, made some decisions that actually we'd regret later because we'd

592
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,320
have to try and scale it back.

593
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:48,520
Whereas from what I'm told, um, even unoptimized on the MX4, it flies along.

594
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,800
I haven't actually got one myself, but I'm told it flies along.

595
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,940
Um, and it's, you know, it's pretty good on this BQ device and we've still got some more

596
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,240
optimization to do.

597
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,440
Um, so yeah, there's still work and we're still ongoing.

598
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,160
And the good thing is that we continue to deliver updates to that device.

599
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:09,920
So even when we moved on to the, to the MX4 and the next device and the next device, all

600
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,320
the previous devices continue to get those updates.

601
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,480
God, the MX4 looks so sweet.

602
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,480
Wow.

603
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,520
This looks like a, yeah, yeah.

604
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,160
I mean, I want the BQ just to have the experience, but I think the one I'm going to land on would

605
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,160
be the MX4.

606
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,680
This is an incredible phone.

607
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,680
I want them all.

608
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,680
Yeah, well sure.

609
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,680
Of course.

610
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,680
That's like trading cards.

611
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,680
Yeah.

612
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,680
Hmm.

613
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,680
Yeah, exactly.

614
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,680
Yeah.

615
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:37,880
So how much, how much energy do you, do you suspect Canonical will put into, uh, sort

616
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,120
of like, I don't want to know if a generic image is the right one, but an image that's

617
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,000
essentially with some modifications that'll work on most smartphones.

618
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,240
Is that something Canonical will ever do?

619
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,200
You can't really do that because the ARM architecture is going to let you.

620
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,400
So there's a couple of things, you know, ARM doesn't really have the concept that the PC

621
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:59,040
world has in terms of ACPI and device discovery, you know, that's, that, that's very mature

622
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:04,560
on the PC and you can have one co-base stick, a USB stick in it and it will boot, auto discover

623
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,600
everything and figure out what drivers to load at runtime.

624
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:15,160
Um, and the second problem is most, um, SOCs, most of the chips that are in phones have

625
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:19,560
binary blobs and you know, that's, that's sad and disappointing and, but that's just

626
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,540
the world we, we live in right now.

627
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:25,460
There are no free soft, fully free software phones, none, none whatsoever.

628
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:30,080
So whenever anyone complains to us that we're not a fully free software phone, well, good

629
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,080
luck finding one.

630
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,480
Well, yeah, if you want to, if you want a phone that makes phone calls, right?

631
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,480
Yeah.

632
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,840
Or is usable in any way, shape or form.

633
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:43,640
Um, so we, you know, we, we have to build, um, an image that is usable, you know, usable

634
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,880
on a specific device, but that's, that's actually where we've been quite cunning with this is

635
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:53,240
that we have multiple layers to the, to the, um, image that goes on the, on the phone.

636
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,120
That's the very base layer, which is the device specific part.

637
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,880
And that's, you know, there'll be a device specific bit for BQ, a device specific bit

638
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,120
for the MX4 and then ongoing devices.

639
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,120
What is that?

640
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,320
Is that, is that a specific kernel?

641
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,360
What, what is that layer composed of?

642
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,360
Yeah.

643
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:13,320
So that's the, that's effectively the kernel and the drivers for things like the GPU, the

644
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:17,600
radios and all that, the sensors, you know, so, so for example, if a device comes along

645
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,840
that has a fingerprint sensor, just for the sake of argument, you know, we might want

646
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:25,400
to support that and there'll be a device specific thing, driver that would need to go in.

647
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,880
But on top of that is the second layer, which is the user space bit, which has got all of

648
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,640
our Ubuntu stuff in and the dash.

649
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:38,960
And then on top of that is your apps, but also the, the OEM or the carrier, um, can

650
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,800
put their own additional bit on top.

651
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,920
So, so we control a bit in the middle.

652
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:50,000
That's, that's the, um, the app, the, the API and all the stuff people write.

653
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Yeah.

654
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,640
And the dash and the common bit that you would see across all the devices, the bit at the

655
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,720
bottom is the device enablement.

656
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,680
And so that means that when a new device comes out, all we need to do is do the device enablement

657
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,720
and then it's the same user space that runs on those.

658
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:08,760
And so when, when, when we want to update an old device, we just update the middle section

659
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,400
and the device enablement bit stays the same.

660
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,400
That's a really good approach.

661
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,440
And it means you don't have that fragmentation that, that Android has.

662
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,760
We have, you know, we can have lots of different devices on the market and they're all effectively

663
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,760
running the same code.

664
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:27,960
Well, and it seems like it's approachable by just a, you know, a fairly well organized

665
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,320
community could come together and say, all right, well, we'll take on supporting the

666
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:35,480
Nexus 4 for another couple of years, or we'll make a Nexus 5 port and me as a more sophisticated

667
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,480
user could say, you know what?

668
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,480
I know this community.

669
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,520
I'll go use their image because if I'm following you, the only thing they would really have

670
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,160
to modify would be that first layer, that, that lower level bits, right?

671
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,160
Right.

672
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,920
So if someone has already created the Nexus 5 port, as you know, and you know, it has

673
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,000
issues, it's not perfect hardware wise.

674
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,440
We're going to continue to maintain the Nexus 4, Nexus 7, and Nexus 10, and then whatever,

675
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,920
wherever other devices come along that we have to support, you know, for a contractual

676
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:05,640
agreement for things like PQ and Meizu and, and, and so on.

677
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,600
So we'll continue to maintain, you know, a whole bunch of devices going, going forward.

678
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,600
Hmm.

679
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,600
All right.

680
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,600
I got a couple more questions and then, and then we'll open up the moment.

681
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,800
Here we are at the end of the year and it's been very interesting.

682
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,800
Popey joins us.

683
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,800
Hey Popey.

684
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,480
So what are your thoughts now, a little bit after launch of the first phone and sort of

685
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,440
looking back on all of that?

686
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,080
So at the time when, you know, before it, before it was announced and before it was

687
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:34,800
released, we really had no idea how many people would buy one and you know, whether, whether

688
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,880
they would all get sent back or, you know, whether people would keep them or continue

689
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,240
and develop software with it, you know, we just didn't know what people would do.

690
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,960
And it turns out that, you know, now, however many months later, what is it now?

691
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:51,280
Eight months later, we're still pushing out images, updates every six weeks.

692
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,880
In fact, we're doing a, an extra one just before Christmas.

693
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,360
I think you'll probably land on phones like a few days before Christmas with some you

694
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,200
know, hot fix updates, but people are still using it.

695
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,160
They're still using it for developing apps.

696
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,680
Some people are using it as their daily driver, you know, not a huge number of people, but

697
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:16,200
we didn't expect, you know, we weren't expecting millions of people to buy them, but what surprised

698
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:22,800
us was BQ were so impressed with the sales figures that they wanted to sell another one

699
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,000
and then they wanted to sell another one.

700
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,080
And so next year there's going to be more phones from BQ.

701
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,080
That's a big deal.

702
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,080
That's really exciting.

703
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,840
Of how successful it was this year, which is great because you know, that's validation

704
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,280
that we're doing something right if one of our partners actually says to us, yeah, we

705
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,280
want to make more of them.

706
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,080
So yeah, it's been a good year.

707
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,520
Yeah, that is probably the best benchmark to go by right there.

708
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,520
Great point.

709
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,520
So one of the things that I got a lot of crap for this year, and I feel like it maybe was

710
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,480
a little undeserved looking back at it, but maybe it wasn't, I don't know, but I went

711
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,000
on a rampage against ButterFS.

712
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,200
In episode, let's see, what was it, I think 87, looking back on it, I think I declared

713
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,200
it a clown file system.

714
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,040
Okay, so I had a real rough day.

715
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:09,880
I came in and I could not get my computer to start.

716
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:16,000
I sat down at my desk, turned on the nice ASUS monitor that I am quite proud of acquiring,

717
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,120
and I stare at a screen and it's nothing but errors, Matt.

718
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,120
Nothing but errors.

719
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,120
Oh no.

720
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,880
And if you're watching the video version of the unplugged program, I'm going to pull those

721
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,800
errors up on my screen right now.

722
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,800
It was devastating.

723
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,880
It starts as this, booting the Linux kernel, starting version 218.

724
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,080
Oh yeah, you know what that is.

725
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:41,760
And then, hold on a second, info, task mount 175, blocked for more than 120 seconds, uh-oh,

726
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:47,200
uh-oh, task ButterFS transaction 197, blocked for more than 120 seconds, uh-oh, and that's

727
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,320
all it ever did.

728
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,880
And then now of course, so here's Chris's conundrum.

729
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,560
Chris has a show he has to go to, and he needs a computer right now.

730
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:03,000
I do not have really, so here's what runs through my head when my most important computer

731
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,200
doesn't boot, I think to myself.

732
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,360
Well, I should go grab a live USB stick and probably boot in there, see if I can get the

733
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:12,400
main OS up and just, you know, maybe root in there and get everything I need and fix

734
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,400
it later.

735
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,680
Like I'm starting thinking like maybe I could like zombify this thing and like prop it up

736
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:20,120
and like get in there, get my work done for the day and then like get out before the whole

737
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,800
thing collapses out from underneath me, and I'm like, nah, I'm not going to do that.

738
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,200
Okay, so I'm starting to think, okay, what are my other options?

739
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:32,960
Well, I had just the night before installed Ubuntu Mate 1504 Beta 2, I think it is right

740
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,960
now.

741
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,960
I think that's the current one.

742
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,960
That's right.

743
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,960
That is.

744
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,960
Yes.

745
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,280
And so I had a USB stick already flashed.

746
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:46,360
I love, you know what, also props to Ubuntu Mate, really, I think the only distro where

747
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:51,280
you just go to their website and the download links and you put ddrescue up there, the command

748
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:55,840
to run, and you just make it real clear, use ddrescue to write this ISO to a thumb drive.

749
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,400
Everybody else always recommends dd, and a lot of times they don't just clearly put the

750
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,200
command right there above the download links.

751
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,600
It makes it so clear, and the fact that you also update the name of the ISO image so you

752
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,120
literally could just copy that whole command is just brilliant.

753
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:15,240
It is so helpful because I myself always end up using dd, and I forget to use ddrescue,

754
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,920
which is way better to write an ISO file to a flash drive.

755
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,540
So anyways, props to Mate.

756
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:26,160
So I had this thumb stick ready to go, and I needed to get working right here right now.

757
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:33,520
So I stick the Ubuntu Mate 1504 USB thumb drive into my rig, I reboot, and I get into

758
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,520
the desktop environment.

759
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:40,840
It's pretty snappy, in fact, it's unbelievably snappy.

760
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:46,880
It's so fast that I was grousing to Rikai who was standing over me because he's trying

761
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:54,440
to console me as I have been mortally wounded, and this gray screen comes up, and I start

762
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:59,180
grousing, oh man, now I've got to wait for the fancy grub screen to render because this

763
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:03,360
monitor is so large that anytime there's a big graphical grub screen comes up, it slowly

764
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,200
paints onto my screen, and I'm sitting here grousing about that.

765
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,800
And what I realized was that that actually wasn't the case at all.

766
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,520
What I thought was the grub screen was actually X11 starting.

767
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:19,080
It had booted so fast that I thought I was waiting for grub, but I was actually waiting

768
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,160
for the entire desktop environment.

769
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,600
It was amazing.

770
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,600
It boots so fast.

771
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,600
It was so cool.

772
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,600
So I install.

773
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,120
I'm like, after that, I'm like, that's it?

774
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,120
That's all I needed?

775
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,720
I just needed my computer to be really fast and I just want to get back to work as fast

776
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,720
as possible.

777
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,040
I've got to do some clipping.

778
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:39,600
And so I installed Ubuntu Mate on my main workstation, this is my rig up in my office,

779
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:44,040
and I used it for a couple of days, a day, I think I used it for a day actually, and

780
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,520
I ran into a couple of issues.

781
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:52,560
First of all, here's the thing you don't want to do.

782
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:58,840
It's not really a great idea to use a beta version on your main workstation because so

783
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,080
many of the PPAs out there don't work with it.

784
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,600
They expect you to be on a released version of Ubuntu.

785
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:11,000
So as soon as you start setting up PPAs for like themes or like a calendar widget or whatever,

786
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,220
you just start getting 404s in your app get update like an animal constantly.

787
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,680
It's just a horrible mess.

788
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,720
And then you end up like, you know, having to go out there and pull some of them out.

789
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:24,600
So that was a bit disappointing and things like Telegram not working sort of were deal

790
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,600
breakers for me.

791
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:29,080
And I ended up going back with Antigros because it was it was so early in the process, I could

792
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,080
jump back.

793
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,640
So now I'm sort of at square zero and sort of setting up and trying to get advice from

794
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:37,960
the audience on what should I try because I haven't set this machine up in about a year

795
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,960
and a half.

796
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,960
So what would you try at this point?

797
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:45,200
And I've already got some base stuff on there, but I have to say it was pretty slick.

798
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:51,600
So here's a couple of things I did in Ubuntu Mate 1504 is I used Ubuntu or I'm sorry, mate

799
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,960
tweak to turn on compass and to set my style.

800
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,320
So I had like a more of a bar layout that I liked quite a bit.

801
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,960
And that was really, really easy to set up.

802
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,960
Really slick.

803
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,200
I decided I opted to use the new mate menu.

804
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,680
And I was pleased to see the super key activated that.

805
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,760
So I was all really good.

806
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,560
The main problems I ran into with the mate menu were like sometimes when I hit the super

807
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,920
key, it would pop up behind other windows.

808
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,140
So when I would type, I couldn't see the results.

809
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,480
And sometimes it was a little delayed and popping up.

810
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,880
So I'd probably still if I was going to stick with that desktop, I would probably use a

811
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,620
dedicated launcher like synapse or gnome do or whatever the hell.

812
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:30,920
But it's such a nice setup.

813
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:35,200
Like I was using that and I could physically I just felt my computer was like it felt like

814
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,200
it was running faster.

815
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,360
And I really was impressed by that.

816
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,920
So Ubuntu Mate edition 1504 is looking really sharp.

817
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,840
I ended up keeping it on the computer I'm setting up for my son.

818
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,800
So he'll be running that for a while.

819
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,520
And I'm now running Antigros with gnome 3 on my main office workstation.

820
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,520
And it was tough.

821
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,520
It was tough.

822
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,520
It was really tough.

823
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,080
Now, did anybody catch that error message?

824
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,400
And maybe what was the problem?

825
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,400
Oh, you did, poppy?

826
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,400
Yeah.

827
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,880
So how long did you leave it after the four minutes?

828
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,920
I actually left it overnight.

829
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,920
And it just kept repeating.

830
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,440
Yeah, and it just kept repeating the same message.

831
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,440
Interesting.

832
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,240
So my home server running better fs does that now and again.

833
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:20,200
And all I do, but that's after it's booted, like and it's fine.

834
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,200
And it's up.

835
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,640
I just SSH in an echo zero as it says, and then I never see that error message again.

836
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:29,620
Because it's only an informational message to say, yeah, holy crap, there's a truckload

837
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,680
of IO going on right now.

838
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,680
Here's what I think it is.

839
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,520
I think blackout 24 is calling it right now in the IRC and I think roof chicken in our

840
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,280
subreddit called it.

841
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:43,120
Another better fs gotcha has been added to the gotcha wiki entry for butter fs.

842
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,120
That's how I see it.

843
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:49,800
Stable kernel versions 3.19.1 can cause a deadlock at mount time.

844
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,440
That's one of the new gotchas in the butter fs.

845
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:56,160
And I think this is exactly what happened to me.

846
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,920
I think I'm on a rolling release.

847
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,920
I'm on a rolling release.

848
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:03,160
And they wanted the packages with systemd and butter fs, right?

849
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,160
What's that?

850
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,760
And they want to do the packages with systemd and butter fs, right?

851
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,760
Yeah.

852
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,760
Yeah.

853
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,760
Yeah.

854
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,760
So there are workarounds.

855
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,040
So if I would have looked this up, there's workarounds.

856
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,800
But you know what?

857
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,920
This is what I came to.

858
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,860
I am so effing done with effing butter fs.

859
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,280
It is not even funny.

860
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,760
So when I was like, you know what?

861
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,660
I don't care that I can fix this.

862
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,000
I'm going XFS.

863
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,720
So what I decided to do is my boot partition, which is about 250 megabytes, is extended

864
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,720
for.

865
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,080
Everything else on the system is XFS.

866
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:39,920
My root file system, my home partition, my editing partitions, my gaming, all XFS, only

867
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,920
XFS.

868
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,200
Butter fs is dead to me.

869
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:47,600
This is the second system I have, to quote unquote, kind of soft lost to butter fs.

870
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,520
As in, I could have fixed it if I really effing wanted to.

871
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,920
In the Bonobos case, I would have had to format.

872
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,320
And in this case, I would have had to do a workaround for the timeout.

873
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,320
It's stupid.

874
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,840
It's a clown file system.

875
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:02,200
It's nowhere near ready, close to quality of ZFS.

876
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,680
And XFS has a rich history behind it, and probably has another 20 years left of development

877
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,680
in it.

878
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,000
So for my taste, I'm going XFS on everything that's important to me, my back end storage.

879
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,320
I'm not even going to use a Linux file system.

880
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,320
I'm going to use ZFS.

881
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,320
I know.

882
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,840
I kind of feel like maybe I'm the one guy out here.

883
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,520
But Wes, you were just saying, you're still a butter fs fan.

884
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,520
Yeah.

885
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,900
You know, I have a RAID 1 set up at home.

886
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,400
That's what my MB runs off of.

887
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,360
That's kind of my main data store.

888
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,680
And Popey, you're still a maniac running butter fs over there, aren't you?

889
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,680
Yeah.

890
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:34,960
I'm just looking across at my little home server, chugging away there with, I think,

891
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,920
12 disks in it, chugging away, still backing up all my stuff, hosting all my music.

892
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,520
The scrubs come out clean.

893
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,520
That's what's important.

894
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,520
OK.

895
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,520
All right.

896
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,520
Yeah.

897
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,000
It's got to the point now where I don't even bother checking any of the cron jobs, because

898
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I know it's fine.

899
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
It's just fine.

900
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
All right.

901
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,920
Well, we'll check back in with you next year.

902
00:38:52,920 --> 00:39:00,400
Is that going to be how it's going to stay, because ZFS was a preview in Ubuntu 15.10,

903
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:07,880
and it's all gearing up for officially being unveiled for 16.04, so I think ZFS is going

904
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,880
to win.

905
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,880
So that's going to be tricky.

906
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,880
That tune's going to change.

907
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,880
Is that what you're saying?

908
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:18,080
When 16.04 comes out, I'll certainly look at it, but I'm not going to migrate, because

909
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:23,640
I don't want to try one of these untested, brand new file systems that...

910
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:28,720
And you know, to be fair, BSD isn't actually used at scale, so it hasn't really been truly

911
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,720
tested yet.

912
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:35,000
And that Solaris that they took it from, that's...

913
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Nobody ever used that.

914
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Nobody ever used that.

915
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,840
That's not professional.

916
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:44,920
So speaking of things that we can barely remember, there was one little controversy that the

917
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:49,960
Unplugged show kind of found itself in the middle of, and that was the name change for

918
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:54,920
Sol OS, or Solus, but don't call it Solus OS, because, well, that could get them in

919
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,920
trouble.

920
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,920
Don't call it Evolve OS anymore.

921
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,080
No, sir, no, sir.

922
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,640
The project name has changed to Avoid Unnecessary Legal Action.

923
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,520
Oh, boy.

924
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,000
So we have Aiki and Ryan here.

925
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,640
Aiki, do you want to tell us what happened then?

926
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:14,920
So, yeah, that was a fun week.

927
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:18,120
Yeah, I've really loved how this has really gone.

928
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:24,320
So on April Fool's Day, of all days, I basically got an email come through, and it said that

929
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,040
I was getting a letter coming through as well, which is like, okay, this is just pure lols.

930
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,400
I was like, yeah, okay.

931
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,920
So I ended up phoning up the people involved independently, finding the phone number for

932
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:43,080
this place separately, and it actually does check out, so I was like, ah.

933
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:46,640
So the trademark is very, very much specific to the UK.

934
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:52,040
So a couple of months ago, we were having problems with people, a completely unrelated

935
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:57,120
incident by the way, but we were having problems with people trying to assert ownership over

936
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,120
the brand.

937
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:03,640
So I took a couple of steps, and I basically went ahead and put in a trademark application,

938
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:08,400
not to be a patent troll, but just to stop people trying to pull one over on the project.

939
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,000
So that was like, so in the UK, that happens for a couple of months, and it's put up so

940
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,200
people can, you know, they can object to it and say, hey, we own that, which someone did.

941
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:24,560
And it's held by the Secretary of State in the UK, and they own the trademark for OS,

942
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,120
which I did not see coming.

943
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,120
Wow.

944
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,120
Wow.

945
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,120
Really?

946
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,120
Whoa.

947
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,320
I could understand if it was Evolve, like when I was reading through the letter, I was

948
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:38,160
looking for the word Evolve, but no, it was for OS, I was like, are you kidding me?

949
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,000
So yeah, I mean, that absolutely and utterly sucks.

950
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,320
I was like, you know, that's one thing that Linux projects are traditionally done to avoid

951
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:50,980
that kind of thing, like have a suffix of OS or Linux or something like that.

952
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:53,400
So yeah, I mean, that absolutely and utterly sucks.

953
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:58,240
So we went through on Google Plus for a couple of, well, I think it was about two days asking

954
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:04,640
for suggestions done on IRC, and, you know, we got absolutely nowhere with a fitting name.

955
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,840
So I just went back to a name that we've used before, which was Solus, but without the OS

956
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,840
perp.

957
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,840
Interesting to follow that project.

958
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,840
And now, of course, here we are.

959
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,880
They've shipped their early versions, and we've even done a review.

960
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,080
And I was kind of curious, Poppy, on your thoughts now, kind of looking back towards

961
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,960
the end of the year on this kind of situation.

962
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,640
I looked at this, and I thought, oh, it's yet another distro.

963
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,640
Who needs that?

964
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,920
And they're doing their own desktop.

965
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:27,920
It's weird.

966
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,920
Yeah.

967
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,920
We don't know anything about that.

968
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,460
And he's barely getting all these builds done in time.

969
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:37,760
But now when you look at it, and he's got this stonking great Intel server in his flat

970
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,040
that he's doing all his builds on, and he's churning out loads of social media posts with

971
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:48,880
screenshots all the time and boot times and, you know, the policy there seems to be genuine

972
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,120
community interest as well.

973
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:57,720
Yeah, it's nice to see someone who is strongly opinionated about what he wants from his distro

974
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,720
and is driving it the way he wants to do.

975
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:05,360
And he listens to input from others, and he's got a community of people who are contributing

976
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,360
as well.

977
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,160
But he's going for it, and I wish him every success.

978
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,480
Yeah, I completely agree.

979
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,840
I think that's well put.

980
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:18,200
And the first early releases of it, and like the one we reviewed, are actually surprisingly

981
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,200
impressive.

982
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,520
And I don't mean to be demeaned when I say surprising, but it's just what they have to

983
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:25,120
work with and some of the challenges they've had to face.

984
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:29,880
It's a whole lot of fresh energy in the ecosystem is kind of what it feels like.

985
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,300
Maybe it's not the direction everyone wants, but it's like, that's a lot of effort put

986
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:37,100
in, and that can only have good, you know, consequences.

987
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:42,080
It's the first new truly independent distribution for a long, long time, and I think that's

988
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,520
what's driving a lot of the interest around the project.

989
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,520
Yeah, right.

990
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,760
It's built from scratch, and it really is something unique.

991
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,720
Yeah, that's a great point.

992
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:56,960
You know, as somebody who, on this show specifically, has talked a lot about Firefox versus Chrome,

993
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:57,960
you never...

994
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,960
Me?

995
00:43:58,960 --> 00:43:59,960
I know.

996
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:00,960
I didn't know quite...

997
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:01,960
It was very incongruent for me.

998
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:02,960
I didn't know what to make out of this story.

999
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,560
Do you remember when a Debian package manager, a maintainer over at Debian, found out that

1000
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:12,000
Chrome was downloading a binary in the background and enabling our microphones?

1001
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,200
Yes, I do.

1002
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:19,960
We had a good conversation around that, and then it went into a much wider conversation

1003
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,760
than I thought was really interesting.

1004
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,280
Okay, so anybody want to jump in first on this Chrome topic?

1005
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,320
To me, it seems like this is the line too far.

1006
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,320
And here's...

1007
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:33,640
I already told this story, so I'll keep it brief, but here's what made me realize this.

1008
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,360
Let's see.

1009
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,760
It was Father's Day.

1010
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:42,400
I was seeing family, and this family, it was a couple.

1011
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:49,200
They have two Samsung S4 phones, a couple years old now, because the S6 is out, right?

1012
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:54,440
And before they installed this update they got, they wanted to come see me.

1013
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,440
So I look at their update, oh, it's Lollipop.

1014
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,000
Oh, good, you guys are going to get Lollipop.

1015
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Great, great.

1016
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Yeah, this is a good update.

1017
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
You're really going to like Lollipop.

1018
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Let's do it.

1019
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Let's install it.

1020
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
So we plug in their chargers.

1021
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
We hit the update.

1022
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,160
It takes like an hour, because it's got to update all their apps too.

1023
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,760
It says it's going to take 30 minutes.

1024
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,760
It does not take 30 minutes.

1025
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:11,760
And it updates all their apps.

1026
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,960
Well, one of the new apps it gives them is Google Photos.

1027
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,720
Oh, okay, Google Photos.

1028
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:17,720
All right, cool.

1029
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,440
So I'm showing them, well, I've got Google Photos on my phone.

1030
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,440
Let me show it to you.

1031
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,440
And I bust it out.

1032
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,160
I'm like, this right here is Google Photos, and it is so great.

1033
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:29,400
I do not have time to tag and organize my photos, and I don't ever manage it, and this

1034
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:33,000
just automatically backs them up to Google servers for me, unlimited storage, and I'm

1035
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,520
just going into the whole thing, talking about how great it is.

1036
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,680
And look at this, I say.

1037
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,920
And I bust out the search feature, and I'm like, it's tagged every person's face.

1038
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,840
And look, it knows this is food.

1039
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,840
These are flowers.

1040
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:44,840
That's an object.

1041
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:45,840
That's a car.

1042
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,320
That's a whatever, a holiday.

1043
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,800
It's gone through and figured all this stuff out, and I'm like, so check this out.

1044
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,800
And I hit the search button.

1045
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:56,800
I say, show me all the pictures of my son, Dylan, at Christmas.

1046
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,880
And I'm like, and check this out.

1047
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,560
I've never tagged any of these photos.

1048
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,880
And the Google Photos app instantaneously, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, auto-populates the search

1049
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:03,880
results.

1050
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,320
Here's all the pictures with Dylan at Christmas.

1051
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,040
And I'm like, isn't that awesome?

1052
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,040
Isn't that great?

1053
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,440
I never told it this is Christmas.

1054
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,840
I never told it this is Dylan.

1055
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,760
It just figured all that out by importing my pictures.

1056
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,500
And they look at me like I am a crazy person.

1057
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:22,520
They look at me like, so how does it know that's Dylan?

1058
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:25,200
And I'm like, well, it looks at the face.

1059
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,200
So it knows the faces of everybody you take pictures of?

1060
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,460
Yeah.

1061
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:32,440
So it knows everybody you ever hang out with that's in your photos?

1062
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,440
Yeah.

1063
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,600
And I won't say this guy.

1064
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,560
Let's just call him Jim.

1065
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,240
And they say to me, they say, well, what about your buddy Jim?

1066
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:44,760
He intentionally, it's his mission in life never to have a presence online.

1067
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,540
He never wants to be tagged in any photos.

1068
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:47,540
He doesn't have a Facebook profile.

1069
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,000
He doesn't have a Twitter account.

1070
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,700
He doesn't have a Google account.

1071
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:51,700
What about him?

1072
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:52,700
What about Jim?

1073
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:53,700
He's in some of your photos.

1074
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,640
I'm like, oh, yeah, Jim is in some of my photos.

1075
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:59,640
So now Google knows that you hang out with Jim even though Jim never wants to be online.

1076
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,560
Yeah, I guess.

1077
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:06,380
And so I expected them to be like, oh, man, this is going to be so convenient.

1078
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:07,680
Now I don't have to worry about managing my photos.

1079
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,840
I don't have to worry about losing my photos when I get rid of my phone.

1080
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:17,480
But because they had never been introduced, and this is my theory, because they had not

1081
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:21,880
really been introduced to some of this Google stuff, they just were kind of all of a sudden

1082
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:26,480
thrown in on the deep end on one of the more kind of creepier things Google can do.

1083
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,800
And they weren't sort of slowly introduced to it.

1084
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:33,140
They didn't see it like be introduced through Google Plus and slowly develop with auto awesome

1085
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:34,400
features getting rolled out.

1086
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,840
And they didn't see the whole evolution of it.

1087
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,720
They just kind of went in, boom.

1088
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,560
And they're like, whoa, this is way too much.

1089
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,540
And now they're not going to use it.

1090
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:50,780
And then I thought, could you imagine if I told them that their Google web browser was

1091
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:54,800
automatically downloading a program in the background that turns on their microphone

1092
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,840
so that way they can say, OK, Google, what's the weather like?

1093
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:02,520
They would think I'm a crazy person.

1094
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,800
So when I think about it through their perspective, I think, gosh, maybe this has gone way too

1095
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:06,800
far.

1096
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,040
Maybe we are sitting here in the boiling pot just, ah, it's Googles.

1097
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,040
You know what they mean.

1098
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,200
Well, there's just one more thing, right?

1099
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,200
But hey, they fixed it.

1100
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,200
Right?

1101
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,200
Now you can opt out.

1102
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,080
So it's just no big deal.

1103
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,520
And we just keep on going.

1104
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,520
One more thing.

1105
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:21,520
One more.

1106
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,080
But every now and then, I have like these reality checks where I talk to people outside

1107
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,840
the tech bubble.

1108
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,180
And I expect them to be like, oh, man, that's great.

1109
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:31,400
And they're like, whoa, are you OK with that?

1110
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,120
Does Jim know you've done that?

1111
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:38,160
And I'm like, oh, and I felt like, jeez, I didn't really think about that.

1112
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,600
Like, I had thought about it, but I didn't really, really, really wrap my head around

1113
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:42,600
it.

1114
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,600
And then this thing happens.

1115
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,600
So Mumbler, what do you think?

1116
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,600
Is this the line too far?

1117
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,680
Sean, I want to start with you.

1118
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:47,680
Go ahead.

1119
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:53,400
Well, bottom line is anything that can compromise my privacy, I want to be asked first before

1120
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,720
you add it to my stuff.

1121
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:56,720
Good point.

1122
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,680
North Ranger, what do you think?

1123
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:03,940
I don't think we should be surprised, because we've seen this before with Android, replacing

1124
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:09,560
gallery apps, camera apps with the closed source Google versions.

1125
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,400
Well, and that's actually what I was going to ask Wimpy.

1126
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,820
And the value of this is negative.

1127
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:17,840
Is this, once again, RMS being right, or are we overreacting?

1128
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:23,480
Is this what we get for using a proprietary browser by an advertising company that wants

1129
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:26,480
to make life more convenient?

1130
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:30,600
But Chromium is not a proprietary application, is it?

1131
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,480
No, but it still happened, didn't it?

1132
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:34,480
Yeah.

1133
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:40,680
And so it probably happened because this is how Chrome is packaged, how Chromium is packaged,

1134
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:44,320
because the two are very closely related.

1135
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:49,400
But the question here is, is who is the package maintainer?

1136
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:54,400
Because if you're using a Linux distribution, ultimately, you're placing your trust in the

1137
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,960
person that makes the binary packages that you install on your system.

1138
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:06,640
Because, as I said earlier, for a brief moment, for example, I'm a maintainer for Debian and

1139
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,160
for Arch Linux.

1140
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,760
So for a brief moment, I have root on your system.

1141
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,880
And the question is, do you trust me?

1142
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:19,640
And there are a lot of people out there that are in that position.

1143
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:20,640
Yeah.

1144
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:26,240
So there are processes in place with the distributions, and they do things a little bit differently.

1145
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:33,280
I think Debian is far more rigorous than some of the other distributions in terms of the

1146
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,240
checks and balances that are in place to ensure that the packages are of a suitable quality

1147
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:41,160
and they don't do anything untoward.

1148
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:47,640
But yeah, you take any distribution, and ultimately, you have to say to yourself, for a moment,

1149
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:53,680
somebody somewhere created this package, and they have root on my system.

1150
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:54,680
That's a sobering thought.

1151
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:57,280
And I think it's a good perspective for us to take because it is the reality.

1152
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:04,460
And when you think of it in that context, in that perspective, you can see why there

1153
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:07,480
are other solutions being worked on.

1154
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:08,480
And this is, yeah, exactly.

1155
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:14,040
And this is why things like atomic and snappy packages and click packages are becoming a

1156
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:21,480
thing because, for example, on Android, when you install an app on your Android phone,

1157
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:24,720
that app during the install process does not have root.

1158
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:25,720
Hmm.

1159
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,280
Very good point.

1160
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,280
Yeah.

1161
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,280
Okay.

1162
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,680
Inagogo, I want to give you a chance to say maybe Jim is a lost cause, that him never

1163
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,720
having an online presence is not possible in 2015.

1164
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,080
Should I not feel so bad?

1165
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:42,760
Well, it's kind of not possible because he could have walked past a shop that is selling

1166
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:48,120
its CCTV camera with an app that you can download on the app, so that lets you see CCTV cameras.

1167
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:49,120
Sure.

1168
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,120
That then means he's been online.

1169
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:51,120
That's true.

1170
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:56,200
It is quite hard to avoid cameras nowadays that all use the internet.

1171
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,200
Yeah.

1172
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,560
Isn't that so true?

1173
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:01,520
So here's what I wanted to kind of put out there as maybe a feeler.

1174
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:07,680
If you go to linuxactionshow.reddit.com, find episode 98 feedback thread.

1175
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:12,880
Why could I recommend them that they could put on a phone, it'd be great if it supported

1176
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:18,400
iOS and Android, so maybe I could use it myself, that would work for backup.

1177
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:27,180
So I tried BitTorrent Sync, it'll copy pictures off, but it's not the same thing to just copy

1178
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:30,940
the data as it is to actually have a little intelligence behind it.

1179
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:32,800
There's another app out there called Picture Life.

1180
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,680
This is a private company they recently bought up that does the same thing that Google Photos

1181
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:37,680
does privately.

1182
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,680
You pay more for it.

1183
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:39,680
I don't know.

1184
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:40,680
I actually forget.

1185
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:44,000
I just was looking at it sort of casually, and it automatically backups your photos,

1186
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,480
does the face tagging, does sort of like location tagging and tracking, but it's a separate

1187
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,480
private company.

1188
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,840
It's not part of an information behemoth.

1189
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:56,320
That's kind of appealing, but I would really like an open source solution for photo backup.

1190
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:59,840
Something where the user can let it run in the background, automatically copy the photos

1191
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:07,120
off sort of like Google Photos does, or BitTorrent Sync, or Dropbox, or actually I think there's

1192
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,120
even a way to do it with OwnCloud.

1193
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:12,000
I haven't – yeah, okay, yeah, Mr. Grumpy R says, yeah, there is a way to do it with

1194
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
OwnCloud.

1195
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I haven't really played with that.

1196
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,160
That might be worth playing with, but then see they'd have to have an OwnCloud server.

1197
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,000
Yeah, that's a hard one.

1198
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
That is a hard one.

1199
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,760
I loved how we kind of made that transition from starting about Chrome and to getting

1200
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:26,360
to the broader conversation, but before we go any further, I want to talk about something

1201
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,360
that's broad, and that's DigitalOcean.

1202
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:32,560
Go over to DigitalOcean.com and use our promo code DOUNPLUGED to get a $10 credit, and then

1203
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:36,040
you can try out their $5 rig, two months for free.

1204
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,040
Think about that.

1205
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:41,120
If you did that right now, you could try it out, and it would still be working in the

1206
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,600
future in 2016 for free.

1207
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,600
Whoa!

1208
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:45,600
That's right.

1209
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,840
Use our promo code DOUNPLUGED over at DigitalOcean.com, a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated

1210
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:52,880
to offering the most intuitive and easy way for you to get a Linux rig up in the cloud,

1211
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:58,440
backed by KVM, using SSDs so that way the I.O. is super fast with crazy great connections

1212
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:04,560
in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, London, Germany, and Toronto.

1213
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:07,040
Maybe you promised your niece a new Minecraft server.

1214
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,040
Spin it up.

1215
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,040
Dude.

1216
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,600
Maybe your new year's resolution was start a new blog.

1217
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:12,680
Holy smokes.

1218
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,000
Give the gift of Linux infrastructure.

1219
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Holy smokes.

1220
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Exactly.

1221
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Use the promo code DOUNPLUGED.

1222
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,640
Actually, you know, I have a Minecraft server.

1223
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:20,640
Do you really?

1224
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:21,640
I do.

1225
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:22,640
I have a SyncThing server.

1226
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:23,800
I got an own cloud server.

1227
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,240
I got a STUN server up there.

1228
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,240
What else do I have up there?

1229
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:28,760
I have an MB server up there.

1230
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:32,600
I have a Quasal core server, a Quasal server up there.

1231
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:36,640
Of course, I have a web server that does a couple of just small tasks for me.

1232
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,520
I have a GPG server up there.

1233
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,960
I got all kinds of stuff up there on DigitalOcean.

1234
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,000
It is really great.

1235
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,520
Their interface is very intuitive, very straightforward.

1236
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:48,960
They have a great API that pushes that all the way into your hands, like you can just

1237
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:49,960
create a great script.

1238
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:54,320
There's a bunch of libraries that work with it or tons and tons of community apps that

1239
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:57,560
are open source and ready to take advantage of.

1240
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:03,200
Really great control panel, very reasonable cost, entire Linux infrastructure, HTML5 consoles

1241
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,920
to manage all of it, DOUNPLUGED is the promo code.

1242
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:10,960
DigitalOcean has been rocking support of this show for the entire 2015 year, and it would

1243
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,960
mean a lot to me if you went over there and used that promo code to keep our show going

1244
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:17,640
as a thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged show.

1245
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,920
So DOUNPLUGED, that's all you got to do.

1246
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,040
Try them out for two months, absolutely free.

1247
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:27,120
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Unplugged show.

1248
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:30,120
DigitalOcean reminds me of the future, and something else that kind of felt like the

1249
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:35,440
future was our conversation around open source artificial intelligence and the Mycroft device.

1250
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:41,720
So in the pre-show, we were talking about this really cool Kickstarter called the Mycroft,

1251
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:48,560
and literally in between a few moments ago and now since we started the show, we've had

1252
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:51,640
somebody from the Kickstarter join us in the Mumble Room.

1253
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:55,960
I believe he's their Chief Technology Officer, so I want to bring him onto the show right

1254
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:56,960
now.

1255
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,760
Ryan, welcome to Linux Unplugged.

1256
00:55:58,760 --> 00:55:59,760
Welcome back, I should say.

1257
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,480
Yeah, it's good to be back.

1258
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,560
I love this show so much.

1259
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:10,360
Okay, so Ryan, in your own words, what is the Mycroft device and what's your involvement

1260
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:12,300
with the project?

1261
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:16,640
So in my own words, have you ever wanted to walk into your house and have it be like you're

1262
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,800
on the Starship Enterprise?

1263
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,200
Yes, every day.

1264
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,960
Well this project allows you to do that.

1265
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:26,760
It's an artificial intelligence for controlling your entire home, from entertainment to your

1266
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:31,040
appliances to your lights to your music.

1267
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:35,720
Everything can run through Mycroft because it's powered by Linux.

1268
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:39,600
And how much of an infrastructure is there to just like, if I'm a consumer, if I had

1269
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:43,080
something like this, I set it up, put it on my table, am I ready to start using it or

1270
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,840
is it like I have to write the apps for it?

1271
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:47,840
Absolutely.

1272
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:52,240
You do not have to write anything if you don't want to.

1273
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:56,500
That's actually a lot of questions I've gotten is, okay, it's open source, drop the code

1274
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:57,860
on us right now.

1275
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:04,160
And we're like, no, we want to, but we are putting in place ways to easily manage it

1276
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,060
and contribute to the project.

1277
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:12,760
And before we ever started on this, we actually, this came out of a selfish endeavor.

1278
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:16,920
We wanted, we had this place, it's a maker space here in Lawrence, Kansas, and we wanted

1279
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:21,880
to power the whole place using an artificial intelligence.

1280
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:25,440
And so we went through all these different open source projects that were already out

1281
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:30,600
there, you know, this personal assistance type things, and none of them did what we

1282
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,600
wanted.

1283
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:32,600
We wanted to control the lights.

1284
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:37,880
We wanted to be able to add new modules and essentially make it power the entire space.

1285
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:43,280
And everything was limited or really hard to install or really hard to configure.

1286
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:47,880
And we were like, this is not a good shape for this to be in.

1287
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:52,560
I mean, we've already got things like Google Now and Siri and Echo coming out, and they're

1288
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:56,560
all super tied into their own ecosystems, they're proprietary.

1289
00:57:56,560 --> 00:58:00,880
And we were like, this is something open source can actually do better, you know?

1290
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:05,680
And so a big differentiator here, and maybe also the biggest question mark is it's running

1291
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:13,680
a local AI, a local AI that seems to be powering a lot of the recognition and all of that.

1292
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:14,800
Is that all done locally?

1293
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,000
Is there no cloud component to this?

1294
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,320
There is a cloud component, and we've received a lot of questions about that.

1295
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:24,800
We use PocketSphinx for the keyword recognition.

1296
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:29,740
PocketSphinx is a local library that analyzes, you know, it doesn't go anywhere, it's just

1297
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:31,040
listening for its keyword.

1298
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:36,320
Until then, you can say anything, and it's not going anywhere, and that's good, because

1299
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:40,720
you don't want everything you say in your house to be streamed up to a server.

1300
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:44,640
Right, so the voice processing for the trigger words is done locally.

1301
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:51,040
Yeah, but at that point, we actually send it off to a few different places, and essentially

1302
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:57,320
whichever comes back first, we analyze it for quality, like how accurate do we think

1303
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:03,160
this is, and then, you know, depending on how accurate that first speech to text thing

1304
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:07,560
is, and we have our own ways of kind of figuring that out, we either accept it, or we wait

1305
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:12,200
for the next one to come in, and we're hoping that people will be able to make decisions

1306
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:18,360
for themselves, at least our technical users, for which services they want to use for analyzing,

1307
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:23,000
you know, the queries, and then go from there.

1308
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,440
The machine itself actually decides what to do with the query when it gets it back.

1309
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:32,120
So when it analyzes what you say, and this is really complicated, and I'm sorry, there's

1310
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:35,480
not really a great way to encapsulate this into an easy-sized thing to put.

1311
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,480
No, it's actually fascinating.

1312
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:41,080
So the decision, the action taken, isn't made up in the cloud service.

1313
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:44,200
The answer is provided to the local box, and that's where the decision is made on what

1314
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,200
to do.

1315
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,200
That's correct, that's correct.

1316
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,200
That's nice.

1317
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:52,220
It comes back with a confidence, it says this is what we think it said, and then the local

1318
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:57,200
machine goes through its modules very, very quickly to decide which one applies to that.

1319
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:02,960
So if Chris Fisher says, I want you to play the Deadpool trailer on my TV in the living

1320
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,800
room, it's going to come back, it's going to look at the media module.

1321
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:09,600
The media module is going to say, I'm pretty sure he wants YouTube, then the YouTube module

1322
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:14,300
is going to be activated, which is going to cast that to the Chromecast in your living

1323
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:15,300
room TV.

1324
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:16,300
Sure.

1325
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:17,300
Huh.

1326
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:21,620
That's pretty slick, and I guess the nice thing here is if this really, really reaches

1327
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:25,980
its goal, regardless of how well the device does, there could be a significant contribution

1328
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:28,060
by having this open source AI project.

1329
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:30,000
So can you tell me more about that?

1330
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,420
Is it a server client thing?

1331
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:32,860
Is it all open?

1332
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:34,500
Is there a proprietary aspect to it?

1333
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,620
What's going on with this AI, and what's it called exactly?

1334
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:40,300
So the AI itself is called Mycroft.

1335
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:43,980
It's named after Mycroft Holmes, which is Sherlock Holmes' brother.

1336
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:50,000
It's also, there's this book called The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which has an artificial

1337
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,540
intelligence in it named Mycroft.

1338
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:57,420
And Mycroft is important because Mycroft, being Sherlock's home brother, was supposed

1339
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:58,420
to be super intelligent.

1340
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:02,540
He was supposed to be able to just, you know, he had an excellent memory, was able to just

1341
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:05,620
pull information out of his head at a moment's notice.

1342
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:08,540
And so that's where the inspiration came from for the name.

1343
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:15,340
The actual device itself is completely open, open hardware, open software, and the entire

1344
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:19,660
unit and everything related to it is going to be open.

1345
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:25,780
The only thing I can imagine maybe having some parts being held back would be some of

1346
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:33,460
our backend infrastructure for, you know, like we want everything that comes through

1347
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:36,480
our servers to be encrypted and anonymized.

1348
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:41,820
And so I don't know how much of our backend we're going to open source right away.

1349
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:48,100
Being that your show actually was something that I grew with as I grew in my Linux abilities,

1350
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:52,060
I started listening to it probably, oh God, like I don't want to guess how many years

1351
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:54,860
ago.

1352
01:01:54,860 --> 01:02:00,580
And so my goal is as a result of being kind of raised in this culture and having like

1353
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:08,740
a lot of my tech knowledge grow with the open source community and my involvement in it,

1354
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:14,900
I would eventually like to get everything that we create open sourced.

1355
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:20,100
But there's also, we have to find the best way to do that and we have to do it at the

1356
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:23,460
right time or else people will be like, this software is crap.

1357
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:28,740
And so the way it interfaces with home automation devices, is that through like the APIs that

1358
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:29,740
those vendors provide?

1359
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:34,460
Like so SmartThings Hub or Philips Hughes, that's essentially, it's just interfacing

1360
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:36,660
with those APIs that exist out there already.

1361
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:38,360
Yes, that's exactly right.

1362
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:43,500
Anything your Linux box can do, Mycroft can do because it's built on top of Raspberry

1363
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:44,620
Pi.

1364
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:50,900
And so anything you can run on a Linux box, the way that the modules are created is it

1365
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:58,120
can just send off a command through the Raspberry Pi to a device.

1366
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:01,940
So how is that then, how is that done from the user?

1367
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:05,100
How is that set up from a user perspective in a device that's all done with voice commands?

1368
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:08,180
Is there some sort of web interface or how do you, I know it's getting down to the details,

1369
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:12,280
I'm just curious, how does an end user do interface with something like this?

1370
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:15,160
So there are two ways I see it.

1371
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:21,900
There's the for grandma, you know, and then there's for someone like Chris Fisher.

1372
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:28,300
And grandma will use an application to install modules that others have created.

1373
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:33,180
And then when they're installed, like if she installs Pandora, it'll say on her phone or

1374
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:38,900
on her computer, it will say, you know, log in, okay, we've imported your stations, you

1375
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:43,420
know, and then and it'll say, would you like to create custom names for these stations,

1376
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:45,420
you know, beyond their normal name.

1377
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:53,820
So if you say, play my jam, it will go directly to the station you've designated as my jam.

1378
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:59,140
But for Chris Fisher, you might want to actually create a module that does something related

1379
01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:01,580
to your studio over there.

1380
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:07,760
And the way that that works is you can create a module and install it locally on your machine

1381
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,300
just by logging into your machine.

1382
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:14,340
And then if you want to contribute it back to the community, you can and we'll have a

1383
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:18,700
community repo where people can contribute their own modules back.

1384
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:23,640
We at the makerspace, we have a whole bunch of drones, and we fly them.

1385
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:27,720
And we've also got them so we can design flight paths for them.

1386
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:31,320
And so right now we're working on a module where we say Mycroft launched the drone to

1387
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:36,140
do a perimeter check, and he goes on a predefined flight path.

1388
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:43,420
And so that's the point, though, is I was getting very upset that I could get an Echo

1389
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:47,140
or one of these other devices in my house, but I would have no control over what services

1390
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:48,660
I could use with it.

1391
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:51,260
It'd be whatever Amazon told me I could use.

1392
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:52,940
And that's where I think the big difference is.

1393
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:54,580
People are like, I don't understand what's different.

1394
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:58,660
And it's like, well, if you get an Amazon Echo, Amazon is going to control every single

1395
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:00,300
thing that can interface with.

1396
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:07,660
Because they're proprietary, because they're this ecosystem that's going to put their

1397
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:13,920
own products and services ahead of others, that's something you don't run into with Mycroft,

1398
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,860
because Mycroft is open.

1399
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:20,680
And we're not going to prioritize anybody because frankly, we can't.

1400
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:24,680
People will be able to install whatever modules they want when we don't want to limit what

1401
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:26,740
they can install on their own device.

1402
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:32,460
$99,000, is that enough to build an open source artificial intelligence and manufacture and

1403
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:35,500
ship units like this out to customers?

1404
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:37,940
So that's a really good question.

1405
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:42,740
The $99,000, so we've already bankrolled this a lot.

1406
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:47,880
We come from a background of most of the people on the team, this isn't their first rodeo,

1407
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:50,020
this isn't their first company.

1408
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:56,540
And our CEO, Joshua Montgomery, has been featured in Ars Technica and a few other big online

1409
01:05:56,540 --> 01:06:02,260
publications for his work on the Wicked Fiber Initiative in Lawrence, Kansas, to get one

1410
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:07,300
gigabit internet service to everybody in the town.

1411
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:14,220
And so we've had experience, and we all come from different backgrounds and maybe in different

1412
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:18,040
companies that we've played a role in starting and everything.

1413
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:23,980
What this says, $99,000, yes, will allow us to ship our first units.

1414
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,580
That would be great.

1415
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:32,700
But it will also allow us to be able to have that reassurance that we're doing something

1416
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:40,300
that people want, and we're ready to invest more in it because of that.

1417
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:46,180
We think that, first off, we have a little bit of funds that we're willing to pour into

1418
01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:53,660
the project if we know that there's some actual desire for a product like this.

1419
01:06:53,660 --> 01:07:01,740
And secondly, if we actually do fund, that allows us to go to investors and say, hey,

1420
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:07,520
we want to take this to the next level, and here's the interest and everything.

1421
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:15,180
But I would love to see us beat our Kickstarter goal and have enough resources to actually

1422
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:22,920
completely fund this from our fans and not have to go to investors if we don't have to.

1423
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:27,980
But we've already planned for the next step in the event that we fund, and everybody will

1424
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:34,060
be able to get their unit and will be in pretty decent shape for a good long time.

1425
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:40,140
So I would say if something like this interests you, head over there and back it.

1426
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:42,580
And if you have any questions, hit us up.

1427
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:44,040
You can message us on Kickstarter.

1428
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:49,860
I'm in the chat occasionally, but you can also find me on Google Plus and Twitter, at

1429
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:52,940
ryanleesipes, and just ask me a question.

1430
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:59,300
I had a chance to chat with Ryan at System76 when I went out there, and they are extremely

1431
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:01,040
passionate about what they're trying to do.

1432
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:05,900
And what I love about Ryan is he's really got a good handle on the big picture, the

1433
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:08,300
big picture of where they could take this thing.

1434
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:14,540
I don't know where that is yet, but man, his example in our interview where he talked about

1435
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:19,380
they have Mycroft hooked up to a drone, and they just say drone, or they just say Mycroft,

1436
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:23,620
scan the premises, and Mycroft launches a drone, and it goes around and takes surveillance

1437
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:25,660
of the premises and gives them a report.

1438
01:08:25,660 --> 01:08:26,660
That is amazing.

1439
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:27,660
Yes, that is.

1440
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:31,140
If you're not feeling safe at home tonight, tell the Mycroft device to go out and do it.

1441
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:32,460
And you can audit that, right?

1442
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:36,740
I mean, it's not just some drone that's watching everything and you have no idea how it's processing,

1443
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:38,100
where it's sending that.

1444
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:39,100
This is your drone.

1445
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:40,100
Yeah, yeah.

1446
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:45,580
And of course, with all the other commercial artificial intelligence help out there, it's

1447
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:50,300
nice to have something that's open source and something that uses code to locally listen

1448
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:51,580
that we can trust.

1449
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:57,040
I want to shift gears now and talk about something that was a big revelation for Noah and I.

1450
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:02,100
We went down to LinuxCon, aka DockerCon this year, and one of the things we walked away

1451
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:08,740
with was Docker and containers on Linux is really what the enterprise is talking about,

1452
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:12,860
but more so than that, how they can actually manage it once they've deployed hundreds

1453
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:16,020
of Docker containers that they don't have such a handle on.

1454
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:19,980
Now, Noah, one of the things that jumped out at me about that talk, and he's talking about

1455
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:26,060
security, is one of the main things that the vendors here are showcasing is how to patch

1456
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:29,660
your applications in containers.

1457
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:33,860
Everybody has a different solution for that, how to manage container security, how to update

1458
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:37,580
applications in containers, how to know when the applications in the containers have gone

1459
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:44,180
behind, how to know when the application quits working, all of that is, I would say, and

1460
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:47,660
maybe, do you agree that it seems to be the number one product that's being talked about

1461
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:50,660
here, the number one problem?

1462
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:56,820
The container technologies themselves, we've built communities and there's already that,

1463
01:09:56,820 --> 01:09:59,860
the standards exist for that, right?

1464
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:04,580
What's left, where the market is, where there's left to make a business or money is in products

1465
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:08,180
managing those things, because like we were talking about at the drive, is you're not

1466
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:14,540
going to, nobody is going to manage that stuff from the command line, even if it's possible,

1467
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:17,460
so you need some sort of a solution, especially if you're doing it at a scale.

1468
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:22,020
Yeah, and the other thing is containers kind of encourage you to have a lot of them, because

1469
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:27,020
not only is your density higher versus virtualization, so on a server that could have 10 virtual

1470
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:31,260
machines, maybe you can now have 20 containers, because you don't have the emulation overhead,

1471
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:35,340
but you also are kind of encouraged to do a container per application, so you put your

1472
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:40,480
mail server in a container, and your web server in a container, and your group collaboration

1473
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:43,460
thing in it, all these different things go in containers, all of a sudden you have a

1474
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:47,180
dozen containers for one small office, and so one of the things that they're finding

1475
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:51,420
and talking about here is that container proliferation is just exploding, and then even small shops

1476
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:54,340
have all of these containers they have to manage, and then the other thing they want

1477
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:57,100
to do is move them between services, depending on which one is more cost effective.

1478
01:10:57,100 --> 01:11:01,180
Now the next thing we're going to get into is a clip that perfectly demonstrates, as

1479
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:06,060
commercial software moves into areas that are more and more and more important to our

1480
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:11,020
daily lives, it is becoming more critical than ever that we as consumers can crack it

1481
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:13,020
open and take a look at it.

1482
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:17,580
I think this next story and this clip and discussion we had perfectly demonstrates this,

1483
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:21,320
and not only does it demonstrate this, but we managed to also demonstrate why the discussion

1484
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:25,900
around DRM can still happen, and it can have a new spin, but first I want to tell you about

1485
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:27,780
our friends over at Linux Academy.

1486
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:32,180
This is a great resource for you to learn more about the technology and resources around

1487
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:33,180
Linux.

1488
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:37,340
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged, go there, get our special discount, and learn more.

1489
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:40,900
It's a platform for learning more about all of the great technologies around Linux, no

1490
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:41,980
matter how much time you have.

1491
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:45,820
They have an availability planner, you go in there and say I've got time on Monday and

1492
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:50,120
Tuesdays and Fridays, and it will generate courseware that matches that.

1493
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:53,700
You go into the Nugget sections, they have deep dives that last two minutes to six minutes,

1494
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:57,300
but then when you're really ready to immerse yourself, they have nearly 2,000 self-paced

1495
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:02,900
courses with instructor help available on demand, created by Linux enthusiasts and educators

1496
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:03,940
and developers.

1497
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:08,320
Go to LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged, check it out, they have downloadable comprehensive

1498
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:12,940
study guides, seven plus distributions you can choose from, the entire AWS stack, Red

1499
01:12:12,940 --> 01:12:17,120
Hat, OpenStack, graded server exercises.

1500
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:18,380
You hear that airplane out there, Wes?

1501
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:19,380
I sure do.

1502
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:20,660
You hear that airplane flying over?

1503
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:23,820
Those are people that are celebrating their successes by Linux Academy.

1504
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:26,140
They're just flying around in the Linux Academy jet.

1505
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:27,620
Okay, well that's not true.

1506
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:28,860
But it might be true.

1507
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:30,220
It could be Santa's sleigh.

1508
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:32,820
Oh, but you know, it's got to be Linux powered.

1509
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:35,220
How else could it be so reliable?

1510
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:36,220
I agree.

1511
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:37,220
And you know what?

1512
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:39,300
When those reindeers had to build a Linux powered sled, do you know where they learned

1513
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:40,300
their Linux fundamentals?

1514
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:41,300
Linux Academy.

1515
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:42,300
Linux Academy.

1516
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:46,180
They went to LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged and they got that reindeer discount and you

1517
01:12:46,180 --> 01:12:48,540
can too, and you support the show.

1518
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:52,580
And it's seriously becoming very respected, you know, like you see someone and they completed

1519
01:12:52,580 --> 01:12:56,260
a lot of Linux Academy courses, you know that they know what they're talking about.

1520
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:57,260
Yeah.

1521
01:12:57,260 --> 01:13:00,460
That is a very good point is because they've been so focused on the content and on the

1522
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:03,980
infrastructure on the course where they pick and they managed to watch the industry and

1523
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:05,860
determine what stuff really matters.

1524
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:10,920
They've gotten a really good name for themselves and that just pays dividends as a Linux Academy

1525
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:11,920
subscriber.

1526
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:15,520
So go to LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged, take advantage of our discount and tell them

1527
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:23,700
you appreciate them supporting the show for all of 2015, LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged.

1528
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:24,700
Thank you Linux Academy.

1529
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:25,700
All right.

1530
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:30,780
So let's talk about this VW scandal where you hooked up the VW cars to get tested and

1531
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:35,500
the computer software made things look a little better than they really were.

1532
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:38,540
And that is where the problem lies.

1533
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:41,660
Volkswagen cheated on emissions tests again, says the EPA.

1534
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:48,380
This time about 10,000 VW, Porsche and Audi diesel engine cars are implicated.

1535
01:13:48,380 --> 01:13:53,380
They're all installed with software that makes the cars emit less pollution during tests.

1536
01:13:53,380 --> 01:13:59,340
When driving on real roads, the cars emit nine times the legal limit of nitrogen oxide.

1537
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:03,620
So this software, I'm going to stop it right there, this software is specifically designed

1538
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:09,580
by Volkswagen that when it is in test mode, it alters the way the engine performs.

1539
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:14,220
And when you're not in test mode, nine times of some of the most poisonous types of gases

1540
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:16,580
come out of the tailpipe of these diesel vehicles.

1541
01:14:16,580 --> 01:14:19,260
Which causes respiratory problems.

1542
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:24,420
In September, emissions cheating was exposed in 11 million other VW cars worldwide.

1543
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:29,260
None of the cars have been recalled in the US and are still safe to drive.

1544
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:34,980
The company could owe the EPA billions of dollars in fines, including nearly 400 million

1545
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:39,260
associated with the latest batch of cars.

1546
01:14:39,260 --> 01:14:46,540
The latest batch of cars includes Porsches, Audis, we're talking high end vehicles.

1547
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:54,180
And this has caused the mainstream press like Cars.com and the New York Times and a bunch

1548
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:59,180
of others that are running pieces that are basically saying that proprietary software

1549
01:14:59,180 --> 01:15:00,180
is the blame.

1550
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:05,420
They say outright fraud is possible because of proprietary software.

1551
01:15:05,420 --> 01:15:07,540
And I think this is remarkable.

1552
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:10,060
They say it's a bad situation to get far, far worse.

1553
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:13,420
You throw a perfectly good phone away after two or three years because the components

1554
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:14,560
goes bad.

1555
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:18,380
But because the manufacturer refuses to provide parts and code updates, really, as the driver

1556
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:24,860
of an old but beloved car that owns its latest 50,000 miles to the abilities of mechanics

1557
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:31,880
who understand the engine's technology, which is a huge great point by the way, they go

1558
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:35,360
on to point out that a day is coming when great cars get scrapped because the automaker

1559
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:39,880
decided it was time to force me to buy a new one.

1560
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:42,340
This is Andy Inocco writing for Cars.com.

1561
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:44,500
In that same report, you know, he touches on the same thing we were talking about the

1562
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:49,820
other week, you know, with Apple users not owning their software, only licensing it.

1563
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:52,820
Here we see that more and more corporate companies, in this case, General Motors, lawyers have

1564
01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:56,320
defended the practice that you don't own the General Motors software in your car.

1565
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:57,320
They do.

1566
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:58,320
Yeah.

1567
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,540
You have no right to play with it or tinker it or make sure that it's not polluting more

1568
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:01,540
than you think.

1569
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:02,540
Right.

1570
01:16:02,540 --> 01:16:04,960
Nine times more than they say it is.

1571
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:08,900
You go in to get it tested, and it's then polluting nine times more than you thought

1572
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:09,900
it was.

1573
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:10,900
You go in to get it tested.

1574
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:11,900
Yep.

1575
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,960
I hope they're revising the tests here as well.

1576
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:16,620
Maybe something you stick in the tailpipe while it drives around.

1577
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:17,620
Pronoun.

1578
01:16:17,620 --> 01:16:19,740
You had a comment about proprietary software by law.

1579
01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:20,740
Go ahead.

1580
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:21,740
Yes.

1581
01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:29,980
I think some law entity in Europe actually had a law that you have to put proprietary

1582
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:33,100
software on cars so they can't be hacked.

1583
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:34,620
Huh.

1584
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:40,420
That is horrible, and obviously, this would be an underscoring reason why that would be

1585
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:41,420
a bad idea.

1586
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:46,980
Wimpy, what do you have here from the podcast on season eight, episode 34 of the Ubuntu

1587
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:47,980
podcast?

1588
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:48,980
Sorry.

1589
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:49,980
That was the wrong link.

1590
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:50,980
Oh.

1591
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:51,980
That's the one after that about the Librarian of Congress.

1592
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:52,980
Oh, yes.

1593
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:53,980
Yeah.

1594
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:54,980
From the EFF.

1595
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:55,980
Yes.

1596
01:16:55,980 --> 01:16:56,980
Actually, this is kind of where it's going.

1597
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:57,980
We kind of touched on this last week.

1598
01:16:57,980 --> 01:16:58,980
Yeah.

1599
01:16:58,980 --> 01:16:59,980
Good point.

1600
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:03,220
But there's a particular point in there about how this affects car security, research, repair

1601
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:04,220
and modification.

1602
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:06,700
What did you catch?

1603
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:10,340
That they've recognized the need for vehicle owners to circumvent access restrictions in

1604
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:12,100
order to repair, modify and tinker.

1605
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:13,100
Yeah.

1606
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:18,100
And one of the things in this VW case is that you're not able to actually determine what

1607
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:25,820
the proprietary software is doing or not doing with regard to these test emission levels

1608
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:31,780
and how the car is being tuned is because it's DRM protected and because of the DMCA,

1609
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:34,580
you're not allowed to hack it.

1610
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:36,540
But under this provision, you now are.

1611
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:37,540
This is a big deal.

1612
01:17:37,540 --> 01:17:38,540
Yeah.

1613
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:39,540
This is a really big deal.

1614
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:45,980
And it is the Librarian of Congress has extended this DMCA, I guess, exemption to also phones

1615
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:47,620
and tablets too.

1616
01:17:47,620 --> 01:17:52,660
And I wonder if this whole Volkswagen catastrophe isn't partly responsible for this.

1617
01:17:52,660 --> 01:17:55,920
It seems to be turning the tide in at least some of the public perception.

1618
01:17:55,920 --> 01:18:01,300
So here is now, I don't want to be like this guy, but I just want to put this out there.

1619
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:03,560
So let's be realistic.

1620
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:05,460
The industry is what it is.

1621
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:09,300
They're not going to be, it's not going to be Kumbaya, open source, blah, blah, blah.

1622
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:13,700
It's going to be at best people reverse engineering and figuring things out.

1623
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:18,940
This software, this stuff is literally going to affect our lives.

1624
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:22,380
It is the stuff that runs our cars, the stuff that runs the trains, the stuff that runs

1625
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:26,100
the drones, the stuff that runs all of this.

1626
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:34,780
Chris, just imagine for a second if SIZA or TTPIP or the TTP was in full effect.

1627
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:40,580
The person that would have found this bug in the Volkswagen software would be going

1628
01:18:40,580 --> 01:18:41,580
to jail.

1629
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:42,580
Right.

1630
01:18:42,580 --> 01:18:46,420
And, North Ranger, you also kind of wanted to play on that, on the DMCA laws.

1631
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:47,420
Well, yeah.

1632
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:54,660
I mean, what Wimpy pointed out with the exemption granted by the US Librarian of Congress still

1633
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:57,500
doesn't fix, I wouldn't call it a loophole.

1634
01:18:57,500 --> 01:19:03,440
It's a big catch with the DMCA is that the Library of Congress exemption only allows

1635
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:13,800
individuals to bypass circumvention and things like cars and video games with servers.

1636
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:17,740
It's still a criminal act to distribute tools to break those.

1637
01:19:17,740 --> 01:19:18,740
Right.

1638
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:19,740
That's a good point.

1639
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:24,100
Wimpy actually has a really good point about how this could be a great opportunity to explain

1640
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:28,420
it to regular users about why DRM and DMCA stuff is so bad.

1641
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:29,420
Go ahead, Wimpy.

1642
01:19:29,420 --> 01:19:35,220
Well, you know, normally we associate DRM with content, and if you try and explain why DRM

1643
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:41,100
is bad, because it protects video or music content to, you know, your friends and family

1644
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:44,780
outside of the open source world, that's a difficult sell.

1645
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:50,820
But if you explain this story, that the software, automated software, is DRM protected and may

1646
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:56,180
be tuning the car differently for its test cycle than when it's on the road.

1647
01:19:56,180 --> 01:19:59,000
But nobody can prove that because it's DRM protected.

1648
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,100
It's a better way to explain why DRM is a bad thing.

1649
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:03,100
We shouldn't have it.

1650
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:06,340
Now that we're sitting here at the end of the year, this scandal's actually gotten even

1651
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:07,340
worse.

1652
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:08,340
More vehicles are impacted.

1653
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:10,420
And, Popey, you were saying you had some thoughts on this.

1654
01:20:10,420 --> 01:20:12,700
I'm curious what you think now looking back at it.

1655
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:17,900
Yeah, right back when it came out, there was a lot of thought.

1656
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:25,140
It felt like the American system was looking at European cars and casting aspersions on

1657
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:27,820
these horrible European cars.

1658
01:20:27,820 --> 01:20:32,260
And I was pretty certain back then that other manufacturers will be hauled over the coals

1659
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:33,260
as well.

1660
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:34,780
And that's turned out to be the case.

1661
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:39,140
And it's a much wider problem than just Volkswagen.

1662
01:20:39,140 --> 01:20:43,420
And I think people are more cognizant of relying on testing in general.

1663
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:47,620
And I think things outside the motor industry are starting to be scrutinized a little bit

1664
01:20:47,620 --> 01:20:48,620
more.

1665
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:57,820
And there's been reports of airlines who are reporting certain levels of efficiency

1666
01:20:57,820 --> 01:20:59,820
that aren't actually true either.

1667
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:05,740
So I think this has triggered in people's minds that you can't just believe the very

1668
01:21:05,740 --> 01:21:08,380
strict test case that was done in the laboratory.

1669
01:21:08,380 --> 01:21:11,840
And actually, there are real world scenarios that you need to think about as well.

1670
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:16,540
And I think it's also there is a good discussion happening now around if software is going

1671
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:22,580
to be in these machines that are so important to our daily lives, is there a reasonable

1672
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:26,120
expectation that I can pull it apart and look at it and audit it?

1673
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:30,560
And that conversation isn't very strong, and it hasn't gone very far, but at least it's

1674
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:31,560
happening.

1675
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:35,240
I think it's tied into, like we saw this year, the Linux Foundation is now backing the real

1676
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:36,240
time kernel.

1677
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:40,380
Like before, where things like BlackBerry's QNX were kind of dominant in the automotive

1678
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:44,020
scene, hopefully we'll see more things where you could reasonably build the stack that

1679
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:47,140
Volkswagen uses and do some tests before you even saw it.

1680
01:21:47,140 --> 01:21:48,140
Oh, exactly.

1681
01:21:48,140 --> 01:21:49,140
That's a great point.

1682
01:21:49,140 --> 01:21:50,140
Bobby, were you going to?

1683
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:51,140
Yeah.

1684
01:21:51,140 --> 01:21:55,060
Yeah, there's a popular talk that Karen Sandler, who used to be on the Nome Foundation, I think

1685
01:21:55,060 --> 01:22:02,300
she's now works at the Software Freedom Conservancy, where she gives a keynote about the fact that

1686
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:04,100
she's got a pacemaker.

1687
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:09,780
And when it was to be installed, she asked, can I see the software?

1688
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:14,340
And the surgeons and doctors had never been asked that question before.

1689
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:15,340
And it's very similar.

1690
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:22,740
There's a device that is keeping her alive, this could potentially be non-free software,

1691
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:27,280
in the same way that you're cruising down the motorway at 90 miles an hour or whatever.

1692
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:33,060
And there's a piece of software inside that car that's preventing the car from just veering

1693
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:38,760
off the road and slamming into the wall.

1694
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:43,500
There is an expectation that we should be able to look at that code and that hasn't

1695
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:46,740
quite reached those engineers yet, I don't think.

1696
01:22:46,740 --> 01:22:47,740
Yeah.

1697
01:22:47,740 --> 01:22:48,740
That is a good point.

1698
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:51,340
And maybe that'll change over time.

1699
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:58,860
And maybe those companies now that are creating that software will be minimized by other offerings

1700
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:03,360
by platforms out there that they just become the hardware maker and somebody else becomes

1701
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:04,360
the software provider.

1702
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:07,220
And I think it's just very early days.

1703
01:23:07,220 --> 01:23:08,220
It is.

1704
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:12,980
And we're watching it now because I think that we have an important view on this particular

1705
01:23:12,980 --> 01:23:13,980
topic.

1706
01:23:13,980 --> 01:23:17,140
So I think 2016 is going to be even more revealing on this.

1707
01:23:17,140 --> 01:23:18,140
Stay tuned to Linux Unplugged.

1708
01:23:18,140 --> 01:23:19,140
Yeah, right?

1709
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:20,140
Yes.

1710
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:21,140
Snappy for pacemakers.

1711
01:23:21,140 --> 01:23:22,140
You heard it here first.

1712
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:23,140
Exactly.

1713
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:27,620
I mean, you joke, but Snappy is legitimately a serious solution to this problem we talk

1714
01:23:27,620 --> 01:23:31,820
about constantly on TechSnap and that is how are you going to make sure that these are

1715
01:23:31,820 --> 01:23:36,660
not home router 2.0 where they just – you get these old Linux running devices out there

1716
01:23:36,660 --> 01:23:42,820
that never get patches and now you have things like universally UNPMP is vulnerable on all

1717
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:43,820
these devices.

1718
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:46,220
Snappy has a reasonable answer to that.

1719
01:23:46,220 --> 01:23:51,100
And I wonder if through 2016 if we won't see that pick up and see more and more adoption

1720
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:54,220
there because it's a damn good solution.

1721
01:23:54,220 --> 01:23:55,740
If I don't say so myself.

1722
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:57,680
If I don't say so myself.

1723
01:23:57,680 --> 01:24:01,300
So yeah, the VW scandal stuff, I think it was interesting talking about VW but like

1724
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:05,780
Pope said, it turns out it's applicable to a lot more people and it really is more

1725
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:09,700
about the broader conversation around that software being locked away.

1726
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:10,700
Audibility in general.

1727
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:15,460
And I also liked our conversation around DRM that came out of that.

1728
01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:19,700
Before we get into the rest of the clips and the next one we're going to talk about is

1729
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:20,940
OpenSUSE Leap.

1730
01:24:20,940 --> 01:24:26,780
OpenSUSE made major transformations this year and it was nice to have R. Brown, the chairman

1731
01:24:26,780 --> 01:24:31,860
of SUSE to stop by and chat with us about it because I mean talk about the horse's

1732
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:32,860
mouth, right?

1733
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:35,820
But because they've been going through so many changes it was particularly appreciated

1734
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:38,500
so we're going to get to that here in just a second but first I want to tell you about

1735
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:39,860
our friends over at Ting.

1736
01:24:39,860 --> 01:24:47,380
I don't know if I'm there yet but my goodness, I'm closing in on my third year of Ting service.

1737
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:48,380
Wowee.

1738
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:49,540
Holy smokes.

1739
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:50,740
And you can get in on it too.

1740
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:53,560
Go to linux.ting.com.

1741
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:57,380
First of all, you get to type Linux in your history bar which looks way better than Red

1742
01:24:57,380 --> 01:25:01,060
Tube, let's be honest, so linux.ting.com but even better than that.

1743
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:04,920
That let's Ting know you heard about it here on the Unplugged show and you support this

1744
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:05,920
show.

1745
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,900
You get to find out a little more and they have a savings calculator.

1746
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:11,100
I invite you to click that and see how much you would save.

1747
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:15,200
Put your actual usage in there, linux.ting.com.

1748
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:18,960
Go there, try it out, get the $25 discount off your first device or if you have a Ting

1749
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:21,240
compatible device and you might.

1750
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:22,240
You probably do.

1751
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:25,400
You get GSM, if you've got GSM and CDMA Network so you've got a lot of choices.

1752
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:28,880
If you have a compatible device you'll get $25 of service credit which paid for more

1753
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:30,040
than my first month.

1754
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:33,280
They have an early termination relief program so they'll help you get out of a contract

1755
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:35,340
if a duopoly talks you into that.

1756
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:41,080
That's really, really nice and you know I was over at the Ting site, Wes look at this

1757
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:42,400
freaking deal.

1758
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:49,040
The OG Nexus 5, $190, $190, no contract.

1759
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:53,600
You get the Google experience, no contract, it's not locked, you have full access to it,

1760
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,400
they don't get in the way of any updates.

1761
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:56,560
Yep, exactly.

1762
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:59,520
You get those Google updates right there on the phone, $190.

1763
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:00,920
Bootloader unlocked.

1764
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:02,420
Pay for what you use.

1765
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:07,000
It's just flat $6 for the phone and then it's your minutes, your messages and your megabytes.

1766
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,080
If you're Wi-Fi savvy, this is a crazy deal.

1767
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:11,920
I've got three phones, I'm paying like $40, $45 a month.

1768
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:12,920
See that's great.

1769
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:16,460
Like personally, I'm lucky enough that my employer, they're willing to pay a certain

1770
01:26:16,460 --> 01:26:19,200
amount of my cell phone fee so that they can call me, right?

1771
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:20,960
And I think a lot of people are in that position.

1772
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:22,080
Ting is great for that.

1773
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:25,960
Like I have a set amount, how am I going to go over that amount on Ting, right?

1774
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:27,920
That means my cell phone plan is covered.

1775
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:28,920
So you're making money on the deal sometimes.

1776
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:29,920
Yeah, exactly.

1777
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:32,840
That's really clever, Wes.

1778
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:33,840
And thanks to Ting.

1779
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:38,640
Yeah, linux.ting.com to support this show and get on the deal with a ton of good devices.

1780
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:42,160
Everything from just like a bare bones GSM card and feature phone all the way up to the

1781
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:47,440
latest and greatest Android devices and internet phone devices from Apple.

1782
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:51,920
Try out that savings calculator, plug in your usage, see how much you would actually save

1783
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:56,960
and then realize you now have the flexibility of choosing GSM or CDMA whenever you want

1784
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:58,400
like a boost.

1785
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:01,120
linux.ting.com, linux.ting.com.

1786
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:07,440
And a big thanks to Ting for sponsoring the Unplugged Show all year long, linux.ting.com.

1787
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:10,320
And thanks to you guys for going there and keeping us going.

1788
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:16,920
All right, so let's get into our conversation about OpenSUSE Leap with Mr. Aaron Brown.

1789
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:22,720
All right, well, I am really pumped about episode 118 today because we have a ton of

1790
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:25,800
topics to cover, a lot of distro things to discuss.

1791
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:31,280
So let's kick off the distro things with one Richard Brown, OpenSUSE's, or I believe,

1792
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:32,280
SUSE's chairman.

1793
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:37,280
I forget, it was a very, it was a very, very cool title, the chairman of OpenSUSE, Mr.

1794
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:38,280
Richard Brown.

1795
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:39,280
Please tell us more.

1796
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:40,280
Mr. Brown, welcome to the show.

1797
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:41,280
Thank you very much.

1798
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:48,360
Yeah, and it's chairman of OpenSUSE, but SUSE paid for me my salary, so I work for both.

1799
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:54,120
So technically the SUSE company pays your paycheck, but you're the chairman of the OpenSUSE

1800
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:58,880
distribution, which honestly is way cooler than CEO or any other title.

1801
01:27:58,880 --> 01:27:59,880
Definitely.

1802
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:01,000
Chairman is awesome.

1803
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,120
So Richard, welcome to Linux Unplugged.

1804
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:13,200
And today is a pretty cool week because OpenSUSE 42.1 Leap shipped, and it's like Linux, but

1805
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:15,080
not like we've seen it before.

1806
01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:18,560
Are you guys totally pumped over there at OpenSUSE right now?

1807
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:21,160
Yeah, and the feedback's been amazing.

1808
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:25,200
I mean, we're trying something really different here for people who don't know.

1809
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:30,960
We've got effectively the code base from SUSE Linux Enterprise, so the enterprise distribution.

1810
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:36,200
And we started with that, but then rather than just copying it and shipping that as

1811
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:41,360
our own, we've built a whole new platform on top of it.

1812
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:46,720
And this is something that we've almost, as Linux users, have fantasized about, and it

1813
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:48,640
almost seems impossible.

1814
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:54,800
And it is this idea that you take the core Linux OS, and you make it stable, you make

1815
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:56,760
it secure, you make it predictable.

1816
01:28:56,760 --> 01:29:02,200
But then as an end user, you get all of the trappings of nice updated end user applications

1817
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:03,200
and things like that.

1818
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:05,200
You can get the latest things that are important to you still.

1819
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:06,600
Yeah, you know, the small things.

1820
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:08,000
Like that kernel or X breaking.

1821
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:12,320
Yeah, things like Thunderbird, Chrome, your Steam packages, things like that.

1822
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:21,360
And now, that is one thing to say is actually going to happen, but what is the long-term

1823
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:24,800
plan to actually deliver on that?

1824
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:29,720
How does OpenSUSE Elite plan to actually make that happen?

1825
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:34,400
Well, part of it's all thanks to the tooling we already have, so things like the build

1826
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:40,200
service, which make it really easy for us to do this kind of heavy, tricky engineering.

1827
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:45,320
So the trick going forward is we're going to do LEAP minor releases aligned with the

1828
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:46,440
SLE service pack.

1829
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:49,480
So as they move forward, we'll move forward.

1830
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:54,480
And for each of those minor releases, which are expected about once per year, I expect

1831
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:59,040
to see most of that user space stuff kind of jumping up, catching up with what's common

1832
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:03,920
standard there, with SUSE taking care of the base system underneath as part of the enterprise

1833
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:04,920
stuff.

1834
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:10,440
Now, Richard, what happens when something comes along that says, this is the new standard,

1835
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:14,720
this is something we want to do, and it requires X, Y, Z be updated?

1836
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:19,720
Is there a process in which a maintainer can step up and say, I'm going to make sure that

1837
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:24,960
these libraries and this end user package are the latest version, even though it doesn't

1838
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:27,400
quite track what Sless is doing?

1839
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:28,400
Exactly.

1840
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:31,720
I mean, that's happened a few times already with this version of LEAP.

1841
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:35,600
We actually did it with the kernel as well, so we had a real big bit of community feedback

1842
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:40,440
that they wanted the 4.1 kernel in there, something newer than what SLE has.

1843
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:42,720
So yeah, we've done that already.

1844
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:48,880
I expect to probably hit a few more things again with 42.2, but also we're seeing on

1845
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:53,880
the enterprise side, because we're doing this, they're a little bit braver about some other

1846
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:55,960
stuff they're talking about for service pack 2.

1847
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:56,960
That's awesome.

1848
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:00,760
They might be moving a little bit faster, we might have a little bit less of that kind

1849
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:05,520
of thing to hit than we were expecting when we started this a year ago.

1850
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:08,840
So far, I've mostly talked about this in the context of the desktop and why it seems compelling

1851
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:17,040
to me as a desktop distribution, but is there also a bit of a server answer here?

1852
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:22,240
Could this be maybe somebody who wants to have some fairly modern, up-to-date, front-end

1853
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:28,480
packages of things like maybe SyncThing, Plex, MB, stuff like that, but then also have something

1854
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:32,400
that doesn't have a ton of kernel changes and whatnot.

1855
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:38,400
Do you see a role for OpenSUSE Leap in the server position, or is that clearly still

1856
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:39,400
defined for SLES?

1857
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:40,400
What's your thoughts there?

1858
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:41,400
Definitely, totally, yes.

1859
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:46,680
I mean, as part of this release, we actually tidied up all of the server patterns and installation

1860
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:49,880
options we have in Leap so that they're a lot more straightforward and easier to get

1861
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:50,880
done.

1862
01:31:50,880 --> 01:32:00,440
I mean, there's a big server market out there that doesn't really fit Sleep, so there's

1863
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:03,360
not really too much concern from the SUSE business side.

1864
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:07,840
We're going a different direction, we're going to appeal to a different audience, so yeah,

1865
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:09,880
we're looking forward to seeing how that works out.

1866
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:13,480
One of the things that I think I've noticed that Ubuntu has had to figure out with their

1867
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:19,760
LTS releases, and I think they've done it pretty gracefully, is the updates to the kernel

1868
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:23,360
to do hardware enablements, as they call them.

1869
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:30,600
One of the things that I hear consistently, Richard, is, and it happens about right now,

1870
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:35,440
and Wes knows what I'm about to say, is Ubuntu 14.04 is starting to feel real old, and he

1871
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:39,360
and I know of a couple of examples of people who wanted to go with the LTS release but

1872
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:44,680
bailed because it's just simply too out of date now.

1873
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:51,880
It seems like the LTS updates to Ubuntu and the service packs are on about the same schedule,

1874
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:57,700
so how can Leap avoid this problem where some of the base system starts to become, honestly,

1875
01:32:57,700 --> 01:33:03,840
a little stale, and so things like Steam games start to suffer, or new hardware support,

1876
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:08,600
or honestly, even things like installing the latest versions of Java and Flash to play

1877
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:13,120
Minecraft and do Hangouts become complicated?

1878
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:15,440
What's Leap's solution to that?

1879
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:21,280
Well, the SLE service pack thing is moving up to about an annual release schedule now,

1880
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:25,740
and hardware enablement is a big part of what SUSE do in those service packs.

1881
01:33:25,740 --> 01:33:31,020
So we'll be benefiting from that, plus probably doing some of our own as well for the specific

1882
01:33:31,020 --> 01:33:32,720
hardware that our community's interested in.

1883
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:38,280
So yeah, that should kind of be the bread and butter that every year when we do a minor

1884
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:42,280
release of Leap, hardware enablement should be there every time, keeping this whole thing

1885
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:43,280
fresh.

1886
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:47,600
And would that be when I get, say, a new version of GTK, or would that come at a different

1887
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:51,000
point in the update cycle?

1888
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:54,440
We're really expecting kind of the big things like a new NUM release, a new KDE release

1889
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:58,720
to be sort of synchronized all around those annual service packs we're going to be doing,

1890
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:00,120
minor releases, as we're saying for Leap.

1891
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:06,200
So essentially I get one new version of GTK a year, one new version of QT a year, and

1892
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:07,760
those kinds of things?

1893
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:13,360
Yeah, the open SUSE packaging policy isn't necessarily that strict, so if there's a nice

1894
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:17,080
compelling reason for us to push that out as a maintenance update during the life cycle

1895
01:34:17,080 --> 01:34:22,680
of 42.1, we can, we might, but there has to be a reason because the last thing we want

1896
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:25,280
to do is break things.

1897
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:33,880
Now down the road, in all intents and purposes, is there going to be a 42.2 and a 42.3, or

1898
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:39,140
is this essentially a continuously updating installation that I'm going to have that will

1899
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:44,280
never, that's always just going to, like 42.1 is always going to be the latest, and whenever

1900
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:46,080
you install it's just going to continually be updated.

1901
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:48,680
How does this work and what is my upgrade path long term?

1902
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:50,240
I don't know.

1903
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:53,360
If you want a nice rolling release, that's what we have Tumbleweed for, so that's your

1904
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:56,160
single installation that you can upgrade.

1905
01:34:56,160 --> 01:35:00,180
So 42.1 will have 42.2 next year.

1906
01:35:00,180 --> 01:35:05,640
The upgrade path will be as simple as a zippered up, so our equivalent of an apt distribution

1907
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:06,640
upgrade.

1908
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:09,400
And so we're expecting that to be nice and simple.

1909
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:13,400
You can also do it offline if you feel like doing it the old fashioned way over a USB

1910
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:14,400
stick or a DVD.

1911
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:15,400
That's good.

1912
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:21,840
Yeah, and so yeah, we're expecting these to do one of these service packs every year.

1913
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:28,360
Then when SLEE, do SLEE 13 a few years from now, that's when we're expecting 43.0, which

1914
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:34,960
will be sort of a big, huge change everything, probably based on wherever Tumbleweed is around

1915
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:35,960
about that time.

1916
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:36,960
Okay.

1917
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:41,040
So that'll be in line with what Suse is doing with the big enterprise release then as well.

1918
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:44,360
This sounds like it's, the way you describe it, it's kind of a unique little space in

1919
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:45,360
the Linux ecosystem.

1920
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:46,360
Yeah, it does seem different.

1921
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:52,200
And I look at this and I ask, so I guess Richard, my next question would be if I'm Frank from

1922
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:59,000
own cloud or if I'm somebody who's making say a Telegram server replacement or maybe

1923
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:04,960
Plex or whatever, if I'm creating software for the Linux server or the Linux desktop,

1924
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:11,640
how do I as a software vendor say we are compatible with XYZ version of OpenSUSE Leap?

1925
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:17,120
How can I clearly differentiate for the end user so that way they know it's going to work

1926
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:19,120
on Leap or not?

1927
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:23,960
Because the reason I ask you is because it seems like one, two years down the road there

1928
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:29,080
could be some installations of Leap where something does work and some installations

1929
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:30,400
of Leap where things don't work.

1930
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:34,440
So what's kind of the thoughts there to make it clear to end users if you know something's

1931
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:39,080
going to work on your version of OpenSUSE to say nine months from now?

1932
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:43,120
The cleanest, simplest way would be I'd recommend that all of these vendors, like we're already

1933
01:36:43,120 --> 01:36:48,160
in discussion for example with own cloud about doing this, of either put your stuff in our

1934
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:54,480
distribution or use the build service where building it for whatever variation someone

1935
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:56,840
might have is just a button click away.

1936
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:57,840
Nice.

1937
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:02,080
Because we're not expecting any major heavy architectural stuff so if you want to be extra

1938
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:07,360
sure that the thing is built for every variation of Leap, that should just be nice and simply

1939
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:08,360
done in the OBS.

1940
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:12,480
Wouldn't that be great if we could get just everybody using that?

1941
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:13,720
That would be really something.

1942
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:17,600
So if you don't mind, Richard, I would love to shift gears for just a second and talk

1943
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:20,880
about – well, for a few seconds and talk about Tumbleweed.

1944
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:26,760
So what is – if I'm looking at really – today and really – and let's talk

1945
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:27,760
about 2016 too.

1946
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:31,720
I'm looking at my options as an OpenSUSE user and I'm looking at Tumbleweed it seems

1947
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:33,000
like and I'm looking at Leap.

1948
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,240
I've got two different things in front of me.

1949
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:40,600
I feel like maybe because I'm an Arch user today, if I was going to make a switch to

1950
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:45,400
SUSE, maybe I want to go Tumbleweed and I actually kind of want to ask you straight

1951
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:51,080
up why would I not go Tumbleweed and why would I go Leap?

1952
01:37:51,080 --> 01:37:52,360
What's the downside to going Tumbleweed?

1953
01:37:52,360 --> 01:37:57,760
If there's two different versions of SUSE, what is Leap giving me that say Tumbleweed

1954
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:58,760
isn't?

1955
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:01,520
Leap is giving you a slower pace of change.

1956
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:04,600
It's really down to what Linux is comfortable for you.

1957
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:08,440
The thing we find with Tumbleweed is we've tackled those technical problems.

1958
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:09,440
It's stable.

1959
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:10,440
It works.

1960
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:11,440
You can rely on it.

1961
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:14,920
But it's changing at whatever the pace upstreams are and we have feedback from our users saying

1962
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:18,920
like I didn't want to relearn my entire workflow this week.

1963
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:25,400
So Tumbleweed, if you're one of these guys who likes whatever upstreams are doing, Tumbleweed

1964
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:26,400
is fine.

1965
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:27,400
Great.

1966
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:28,400
Use it.

1967
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:32,280
But at the same time, in certain use cases or just depending on how you are, you want

1968
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:34,160
something that changes less often.

1969
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:41,200
That's what Leap is going for as the two complementary approaches really.

1970
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:45,840
And also maybe if I was the administrator of a couple of SUSE Enterprise Linux servers.

1971
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:46,840
Or even more than a couple.

1972
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:47,840
Yeah.

1973
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:49,560
Leap would probably be a pretty good desktop for me.

1974
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:54,600
We had a lot of people in our virtual log try out Leap after that episode and Tyler's

1975
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:56,280
here and he had installed.

1976
01:38:56,280 --> 01:38:59,120
And Tyler, I'm kind of curious now looking back on it, how's your experience been?

1977
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:04,640
So far I installed it last month, not long after it came out, upgraded from 13.2.

1978
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:07,800
First couple of weeks, the experience was a little bit rough on the edges.

1979
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:11,000
I was trying to reinstall everything I had before.

1980
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:16,600
But I think now that I've had it for about a month and a half now, it's rock solid.

1981
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:17,600
Rock solid.

1982
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:18,600
That's a bold statement.

1983
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:19,600
Nice.

1984
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:20,600
Good to hear that.

1985
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:21,600
I'm curious.

1986
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:23,280
We'll check in in a few more months and see if that's still the case.

1987
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:26,700
Because I still maintain, I think it's a great idea.

1988
01:39:26,700 --> 01:39:30,880
And I think Tumbleweed and Leap are both exactly what they should be doing.

1989
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:33,520
But in a year from now, that's really going to be the telling thing.

1990
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:34,880
How many things got back ported?

1991
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:36,160
How many things actually made it in there?

1992
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:38,280
How many times have they changed direction?

1993
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:39,280
Yeah.

1994
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:41,360
And I'm not saying any of that's going to be negative.

1995
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:42,360
No, not at all.

1996
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:43,360
It's just how do those things-

1997
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:44,360
We just don't know yet.

1998
01:39:44,360 --> 01:39:45,360
Right.

1999
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:49,840
And because in particular these types of distributions, there's so many unanswered questions.

2000
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:53,640
It's just going to be a little bit to see how that plays out.

2001
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:56,120
But the folks over there are super clever.

2002
01:39:56,120 --> 01:39:59,780
And so if anybody could get it right, it is probably them.

2003
01:39:59,780 --> 01:40:01,160
And so I'm kind of glad they're doing it.

2004
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:02,520
I'm encouraged to watch it.

2005
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:03,520
All right.

2006
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:08,320
So this brings us to the last clip we're going to play on the show today.

2007
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:10,680
And it was the one that was the most fun for me.

2008
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:14,120
And I'm betting probably surprising for you, Wes.

2009
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:18,600
That was when Wimpy came on here and he dropped the pie bomb.

2010
01:40:18,600 --> 01:40:21,480
And then we got into a discussion about the future of open PC.

2011
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:25,080
Wimpy, I kind of wanted to pick your brain because I know you've hinted before on some

2012
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:29,920
pre and post shows that, and I haven't gotten, I have quite not yet gotten the complete picture,

2013
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:33,940
but the Raspberry Pi is starting to play a more and more important role for the Ubuntu

2014
01:40:33,940 --> 01:40:37,040
Mate distro, isn't it?

2015
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:40,240
It's our most popular platform.

2016
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:41,240
Wow.

2017
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:45,640
You mean, you mean other than x86 or including x86?

2018
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:50,760
It's more popular than 64 bit, 32 bit, x86.

2019
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:51,760
Holy shit.

2020
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:52,760
Are you serious?

2021
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:53,760
That's crazy.

2022
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:54,760
Wow.

2023
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:55,760
My world has just been rocked.

2024
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:56,760
Are you kidding me?

2025
01:40:56,760 --> 01:41:00,320
No, it's downloaded about 1,200 times a day.

2026
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:01,320
The image for the Pi.

2027
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:02,320
That's awesome.

2028
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:03,320
Wow.

2029
01:41:03,320 --> 01:41:04,320
That's serious.

2030
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:08,680
That is, that is, so what are your thoughts on that?

2031
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:15,440
Well, it means that in the last two releases of Ubuntu Mate, I've done the work for the

2032
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:25,520
Pi version in the last month of the release, but for this release, it's got even, you know,

2033
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:30,280
it's being treated equally all the way through the development stage now.

2034
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:32,800
I feel like I need to take a minute.

2035
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:35,320
Like I wasn't ready for that level of a bomb to be dropped.

2036
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:38,920
I don't know why I didn't know that because I kind of feel like I should have known that,

2037
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:42,400
but it to me is shocking to me, actually.

2038
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:46,400
I've actually been paying attention to a lot of communities around Raspberry Pi and Reddit

2039
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:51,160
or Google Plus and various different places, and the majority of times people ask what

2040
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:57,120
to put on the Pi, Raspbian is no longer even mentioned, Ubuntu Mate is always the first

2041
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:58,120
choice.

2042
01:41:58,120 --> 01:41:59,120
I mean, it makes sense.

2043
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:00,120
It does make sense.

2044
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:02,320
I mean, it's way more pleasant to use and it looks pretty.

2045
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:03,960
With me, that's a big deal, though.

2046
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:07,000
I mean, congratulations because that's a big deal.

2047
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:11,520
And so when you look at these types of devices, are you starting to say, all right, these

2048
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:13,520
aren't just sort of toys.

2049
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:19,000
These are going to become possibly the next open PC.

2050
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Now hold on.

2051
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:24,320
I want to make sure I'm framing this right, but when I look at tablets and phones, I get

2052
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:30,460
a little sad because they look locked down and glued together, and I remember a time

2053
01:42:30,460 --> 01:42:35,520
when I was in high school and I scraped together parts for months and months and months and

2054
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,280
built my first PC.

2055
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:43,040
I went and picked out my own case, and it was a life moment for me.

2056
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:44,520
And you learned a lot along the way.

2057
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:45,520
A ton of stuff.

2058
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:46,520
And I read.

2059
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:49,440
I mean, it was really my first geek project that I really researched and all that kind

2060
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:50,440
of stuff.

2061
01:42:50,440 --> 01:42:54,920
And now I look at this Onion Omega here, and I'm sitting here like Legos building a PC,

2062
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:59,280
and I think, geez, I could give this to my kid and he could play Minecraft on this, maybe

2063
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:02,720
not this one, but the Raspberry Pi Zero.

2064
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:08,880
This is maybe getting to the point now where it is actually going to be something that

2065
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:12,560
has some serious long-term legs as a serious desktop contender.

2066
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:20,240
And one more thing, Wimpy, before I toss it back to you is I, in the late 90s, had a conversation

2067
01:43:20,240 --> 01:43:26,200
with a guy named Scott, a really great guy, and his day job was to run an IBM mainframe.

2068
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:33,920
And he looked down at desktop PCs as toys that couldn't do real work, that weren't powerful

2069
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:34,920
enough.

2070
01:43:34,920 --> 01:43:40,120
And he called the desktops, oh, you mean those Mattel inside PCs?

2071
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:42,600
Those Mattel inside, because they were toys.

2072
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:45,820
And I look at the Omega, and I go, oh, this is a cute Lego toy.

2073
01:43:45,820 --> 01:43:48,840
But actually, maybe I'm looking at it from Scott's perspective.

2074
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:52,720
And when Wimpy sees he's getting over 1,000 downloads a day, I'm wondering, are you looking

2075
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:58,520
at these mini PCs, these Raspberry Pis, and these Omegas, and the BagelBone, and whatever,

2076
01:43:58,520 --> 01:44:03,000
are you looking at this and going, this might actually be something that gets wider adoption

2077
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,880
use than the traditional PC one day?

2078
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:06,880
I think so.

2079
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:14,000
Certainly, if you look outside of the developed nations, I think this is going to be the ARM-based

2080
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:17,460
devices are going to be the principal computing platform.

2081
01:44:17,460 --> 01:44:21,160
And if you're not doing stuff on ARM, you'll be irrelevant.

2082
01:44:21,160 --> 01:44:22,160
Wow.

2083
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:23,880
Bad time to own Intel stock.

2084
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:27,480
I am still sort of sitting here going, damn, that is a big deal.

2085
01:44:27,480 --> 01:44:31,840
And Wimpy, I'm curious, it's been a few weeks, is there any follow-up thoughts to that segment?

2086
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:34,760
Yeah, a couple.

2087
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:41,480
So just before Christmas, we're going to release a point release of Ubuntu Mate 15.10.

2088
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:46,120
So we're going to update some of the bits and pieces that are in the image and fix a

2089
01:44:46,120 --> 01:44:47,480
couple of bugs.

2090
01:44:47,480 --> 01:44:55,920
So not a major re-spin, but I have moved the build over to the Ubuntu Pi Flavor Maker project.

2091
01:44:55,920 --> 01:45:03,640
So alongside the Ubuntu Mate release will also be a spin of Lubuntu 15.10, Xubuntu 15.10,

2092
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:06,120
and also Ubuntu Server.

2093
01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:10,720
So people can come and have a real Ubuntu Christmas on their Raspberry Pi 2s.

2094
01:45:10,720 --> 01:45:15,200
Yeah, I mean, that is sort of perfect for the holidays, people getting Raspberry Pis.

2095
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:17,920
Like we started at the beginning of the show, this Kano here, or however you say, canoe

2096
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:20,920
or whatever you say, that's a Raspberry Pi 2.

2097
01:45:20,920 --> 01:45:23,800
And I'm putting that under the Christmas tree this year.

2098
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:26,920
And I'm going to put Ubuntu Mate on there.

2099
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:29,180
That's a $4 course.

2100
01:45:29,180 --> 01:45:32,600
When we spoke a couple of weeks ago about this, and you were surprised at the uptake

2101
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:35,780
of these on boards, I thought about it.

2102
01:45:35,780 --> 01:45:41,220
And there was a guy who supplied a bit of feedback to the Linux Voice podcast where

2103
01:45:41,220 --> 01:45:47,480
he talked about, he drew a parallel between where the engineers for steam engine construction

2104
01:45:47,480 --> 01:45:51,440
were in the UK during the Industrial Revolution.

2105
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:54,840
And it wasn't where the money was, it was where the raw materials were.

2106
01:45:54,840 --> 01:46:01,360
And he likened this to Linus and creating Linux in that as a 21 year old student, the

2107
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:07,280
raw materials that were available to Linus was an Intel PC.

2108
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:11,000
And that's why Linux was created on an Intel PC.

2109
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:15,760
And these days, the raw materials that are readily accessible and available to most people

2110
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:19,440
around the world are these ARM SBCs.

2111
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:25,480
And it's those boards that are going to drive the tinkering and the hobbying and the enthusiasts

2112
01:46:25,480 --> 01:46:30,520
that we all were with our PCs, you know, 5, 10, 15, 20 years ago.

2113
01:46:30,520 --> 01:46:34,520
And these are going to be the new devices that people learn about computers on.

2114
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:39,920
You know, that that really rings true with me in 1.21, when is when you sort of drop

2115
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:44,320
what I call the pie bomb on us.

2116
01:46:44,320 --> 01:46:45,320
That's when it clicked with me.

2117
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:51,060
I think we even talked about it in the clip is I realized that if I was a high school

2118
01:46:51,060 --> 01:46:56,200
student or even a little younger or in that range, this would be my experimental PC platform

2119
01:46:56,200 --> 01:47:02,360
because the Dells and the Lenovo's and the ample of this world have sealed the hoods

2120
01:47:02,360 --> 01:47:04,560
and put everything under a plastic wrap with glue.

2121
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:09,960
And even then, like I have admittedly fond memories of breaking my parents, you know,

2122
01:47:09,960 --> 01:47:11,600
like desktop computer when I was a kid.

2123
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:12,600
Right.

2124
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:13,600
Yeah.

2125
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:15,920
But these days, for like 30 bucks, you're like, oh, here, here's your whole machine.

2126
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:16,920
Just go wild.

2127
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:17,920
Yeah.

2128
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:18,920
And it makes it reasonable.

2129
01:47:18,920 --> 01:47:19,920
Or $5.

2130
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:20,920
Or $5.

2131
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:21,920
Yeah, exactly.

2132
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:22,920
Yeah.

2133
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:26,440
So that is that has been an amazing trend to really, I mean, to see that come down this

2134
01:47:26,440 --> 01:47:32,520
year, really something and then to see the actual usage tick up in the downloads for

2135
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:34,740
Ubuntu Mate edition.

2136
01:47:34,740 --> 01:47:35,740
Really cool.

2137
01:47:35,740 --> 01:47:36,880
And it just makes so much sense.

2138
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:38,080
It really does.

2139
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:40,800
So I just find that to be fascinating.

2140
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:43,960
And I can only imagine where 2016 is going to take it.

2141
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:44,960
It's awesome.

2142
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:46,240
It rocked in 2015.

2143
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:47,240
It rocked.

2144
01:47:47,240 --> 01:47:49,800
And it's funny, you know, totally just not planned at all.

2145
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:54,240
Here we are with this canoe system that we unboxed today on the show.

2146
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:56,480
And it is it is so much.

2147
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:57,480
It's beautiful, well-designed.

2148
01:47:57,480 --> 01:47:58,480
Yeah.

2149
01:47:58,480 --> 01:48:02,560
And it brings all the current open source technology.

2150
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:04,360
It is really something to see this.

2151
01:48:04,360 --> 01:48:06,920
And I just as a kid would have loved this.

2152
01:48:06,920 --> 01:48:10,040
And they also have mobile apps to manage the system and they have them in the Play Store

2153
01:48:10,040 --> 01:48:11,040
and the App Store.

2154
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:14,040
It says at Team Canoe or Kano, K-A-N-O.

2155
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:15,040
K-A-N-O.

2156
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:16,040
You can't understand this.

2157
01:48:16,040 --> 01:48:17,040
I know.

2158
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:18,040
K-A-N-O.

2159
01:48:18,040 --> 01:48:19,040
I know.

2160
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:20,040
It's hard to pronounce.

2161
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:22,040
I think I want to say canoe because it's like the idea is like it's a canoe.

2162
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:23,040
Or Kano.

2163
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:24,520
But Kano doesn't make any sense.

2164
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:26,600
Anyways, I think they just sent this to me.

2165
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:30,840
I don't think I backed this particular project.

2166
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:32,440
I think they just sent it to me to talk about it.

2167
01:48:32,440 --> 01:48:34,480
And so I'm pretty impressed.

2168
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:36,800
Wes, something else I'm kind of impressed with.

2169
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:40,840
We decided since this is a holiday episode of The Unplugged Show that we would drink

2170
01:48:40,840 --> 01:48:44,720
a little beer as we do from time to time.

2171
01:48:44,720 --> 01:48:47,880
And this is something you brought and you wanted to get something specifically in the

2172
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:49,200
holiday spirit, Wes.

2173
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:51,080
So I won't steal your thunder.

2174
01:48:51,080 --> 01:48:52,480
What did you bring in?

2175
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:55,720
We are currently drinking Stone Coffee Milk Stout.

2176
01:48:55,720 --> 01:48:58,560
Yeah, it's an ale brewed with roasted coffee bean.

2177
01:48:58,560 --> 01:48:59,560
Does that mean it's caffeinated?

2178
01:48:59,560 --> 01:49:00,880
I believe so.

2179
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:01,880
One would hope anyway.

2180
01:49:01,880 --> 01:49:03,280
That is actually pretty great.

2181
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:06,720
And so when you drink it, it definitely has like a coffee note.

2182
01:49:06,720 --> 01:49:08,120
There's no getting around that.

2183
01:49:08,120 --> 01:49:11,640
It's 5% alcohol by volume.

2184
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:13,320
Which is a little lower than I usually bring.

2185
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:15,360
I'm just going to say that right now.

2186
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:16,360
That is true.

2187
01:49:16,360 --> 01:49:17,360
Oh yeah, for the show.

2188
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:18,360
Yeah, for sure.

2189
01:49:18,360 --> 01:49:24,480
So it's Stone Coffee Milk Stout, a bittersweet, creamy, coffee-laced stout from imperial stouts

2190
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:25,520
to IPAs.

2191
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:31,560
We've discovered through the delicious trial and error that the tantalizing, roasty lift

2192
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:35,920
that comes from adding coffee beans to just about any beer style.

2193
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:36,920
And they go on.

2194
01:49:36,920 --> 01:49:37,920
It does pair nicely.

2195
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:39,240
I've got to say, it's darn smooth.

2196
01:49:39,240 --> 01:49:41,920
You know, when you brought in, I was like, coffee and a beer.

2197
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:43,880
I've done beers tasty before.

2198
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:45,960
This doesn't usually go well for me.

2199
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:47,960
And you know what?

2200
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:48,960
It went really well.

2201
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:49,960
It's pretty good.

2202
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:51,600
Yeah, this is a great beer to drink during the show.

2203
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:53,280
So thank you, Wes, for bringing this in.

2204
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:56,760
And I think we're going to give it the Linux-unplugged thumbs up.

2205
01:49:56,760 --> 01:49:57,760
Thumbs up.

2206
01:49:57,760 --> 01:49:58,760
Two thumbs up.

2207
01:49:58,760 --> 01:50:00,440
Stone Coffee Milk Stout.

2208
01:50:00,440 --> 01:50:03,600
Somebody in the Mumble Room, I think, was saying they have just about every stone brew

2209
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:04,600
ever.

2210
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:09,960
I don't know who that was, but anybody in there, a stone beer fan or a fish in the auto

2211
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:12,240
that could chime in and give us more information?

2212
01:50:12,240 --> 01:50:14,800
Because we just basically picked up the bottles here.

2213
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:15,800
We sure did.

2214
01:50:15,800 --> 01:50:16,800
Yeah.

2215
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:19,200
But I mean, I've enjoyed their IPA in particular in the past.

2216
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:20,200
Yeah.

2217
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:21,200
Yeah.

2218
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:22,200
Oh yeah.

2219
01:50:22,200 --> 01:50:23,200
So I'm a con.

2220
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:24,200
I'm a con.

2221
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:25,200
So there you go.

2222
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:26,200
Oh, thanks, Wes.

2223
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:27,200
It was very good.

2224
01:50:27,200 --> 01:50:30,520
And if you guys have any suggestions, feel free to submit those and we will drink them

2225
01:50:30,520 --> 01:50:31,920
and talk about them on the air.

2226
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:32,920
We should.

2227
01:50:32,920 --> 01:50:33,920
You know what?

2228
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:34,920
That'd be fun to do that.

2229
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:37,400
Because one of the things that the original...

2230
01:50:37,400 --> 01:50:40,100
So there was two original ideas for Linux-unplugged.

2231
01:50:40,100 --> 01:50:44,360
One of them was so terrible, I almost feel like I shouldn't even say it because it's

2232
01:50:44,360 --> 01:50:45,360
embarrassing.

2233
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:47,820
Say it.

2234
01:50:47,820 --> 01:50:50,900
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

2235
01:50:50,900 --> 01:50:51,900
And you know who you are.

2236
01:50:51,900 --> 01:50:53,400
There's somebody who doesn't want to mess with the...

2237
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:54,400
I just want to surf the...

2238
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:58,720
I just want to buy something on Amazon, send an email to my kids, look at some websites.

2239
01:50:58,720 --> 01:50:59,720
All right.

2240
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:02,320
So I had to play a little Leo while I could think about it.

2241
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:04,240
I hit dead air.

2242
01:51:04,240 --> 01:51:08,720
So the first idea for Linux-unplugged was I get so much email that comes in the Linux

2243
01:51:08,720 --> 01:51:09,720
action show.

2244
01:51:09,720 --> 01:51:13,920
I'm just going to start a podcast where I just read my damn email because I'm never

2245
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:14,920
getting to it.

2246
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:15,920
And the only thing...

2247
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:20,520
The only work I get done is the work I have to get done to make sure shows go on the air

2248
01:51:20,520 --> 01:51:21,920
because that's all I have.

2249
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:22,920
That's all I have in me.

2250
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:24,800
And it's the only thing I get done is like...

2251
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:26,200
And it's like big things.

2252
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:27,280
I'm not even like...

2253
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:32,320
There's things in my life that are extremely important like health insurance or insurance.

2254
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:34,160
All these things, I don't get those done.

2255
01:51:34,160 --> 01:51:37,320
What I get done is whatever I have to get done to make sure these shows go on the air.

2256
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:40,840
And so I was like, this email is never getting done.

2257
01:51:40,840 --> 01:51:42,760
I'm never reading all these emails.

2258
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:44,040
What I'm going to do is...

2259
01:51:44,040 --> 01:51:46,680
And actually, this is the real concept here.

2260
01:51:46,680 --> 01:51:50,060
I'm going to take Thunderbird, I'm going to open it up, and I'm going to tag emails throughout

2261
01:51:50,060 --> 01:51:51,060
the week.

2262
01:51:51,060 --> 01:51:54,120
And then I'm going to go to that tag in Thunderbird, and I'm just going to read them on the air,

2263
01:51:54,120 --> 01:51:55,440
and I'm going to answer them.

2264
01:51:55,440 --> 01:51:56,600
And that's the freaking podcast.

2265
01:51:56,600 --> 01:51:58,840
You know, Richard Dawkins has a whole YouTube thing.

2266
01:51:58,840 --> 01:52:00,360
He just reads his hate mail.

2267
01:52:00,360 --> 01:52:01,360
I think it could work the same way.

2268
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:02,360
Yeah.

2269
01:52:02,360 --> 01:52:03,360
So that was the idea.

2270
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:05,520
But really, that was a horrible idea.

2271
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:07,920
It was so, so boring.

2272
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:10,200
But then the second idea, I think, is kind of solid.

2273
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:13,360
And it's actually what's inspired the show in reality.

2274
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:19,680
Because the emails have, over time, become less and less a part of the show.

2275
01:52:19,680 --> 01:52:20,680
Fancy that.

2276
01:52:20,680 --> 01:52:21,680
Yeah.

2277
01:52:21,680 --> 01:52:29,520
The concept that I've actually ran with was, what does the world look like to real, actual

2278
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:31,160
Linux users?

2279
01:52:31,160 --> 01:52:37,160
Because there is a lot of blogs and press out there who claim to be Linux users, or

2280
01:52:37,160 --> 01:52:42,000
Linux advocates, or Linux journalists, and they don't actually use Linux.

2281
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,520
And so they miss the mark.

2282
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:49,960
And they don't actually represent the day-to-day actual Linux user.

2283
01:52:49,960 --> 01:52:55,480
And so often, that means they spin things, or they misunderstand things, or they superficially

2284
01:52:55,480 --> 01:52:57,360
read things.

2285
01:52:57,360 --> 01:53:03,200
And their reviews are touching on true and tried talking points that we've been discussing

2286
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:04,200
since the 90s.

2287
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:05,760
And they're just exhausted.

2288
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:07,680
And we get so sick and tired of it.

2289
01:53:07,680 --> 01:53:13,160
And really, if we're Linux users, and something like Chrome comes along, and all of a sudden

2290
01:53:13,160 --> 01:53:17,680
is downloading a binary package in the background that turns on our microphone, how, as Linux

2291
01:53:17,680 --> 01:53:19,200
users, does that make us feel?

2292
01:53:19,200 --> 01:53:23,960
If Volkswagen is, all of a sudden, revealed for altering test results because of their

2293
01:53:23,960 --> 01:53:28,000
proprietary software as Linux users, what is our thought about that?

2294
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:31,760
And you can go back through every single topic we played in the show, and you can see how

2295
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:38,280
we come at it from the perspective of people who use Linux on a daily basis, and thus affects

2296
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:40,400
our worldview.

2297
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:43,480
And you combine the fact that we have this virtual lug that comes in and discusses their

2298
01:53:43,480 --> 01:53:47,680
opinions on things, and they represent that point of view as well, I think it makes for

2299
01:53:47,680 --> 01:53:55,280
a very unique kind of talk show that is not like anything else, because we have gotten

2300
01:53:55,280 --> 01:54:00,720
extremely lucky with really solid contributions from our community.

2301
01:54:00,720 --> 01:54:02,400
I mean, absurdly lucky.

2302
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:05,760
We shouldn't be able to have an open Mumba room and have this many great contributors

2303
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:06,760
come in and speak intelligently.

2304
01:54:06,760 --> 01:54:08,720
Oh, it really makes the show.

2305
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:09,720
Right.

2306
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:14,320
So, somehow, we just fell backwards into that, and that is just a resource that has been

2307
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:19,160
extremely useful, plus you have our perspective as people who are open source advocates first

2308
01:54:19,160 --> 01:54:20,720
and Linux desktop users.

2309
01:54:20,720 --> 01:54:26,120
I think it has made for an interesting perspective for a talk show that can handle a whole range

2310
01:54:26,120 --> 01:54:28,720
of topics, from political to technical.

2311
01:54:28,720 --> 01:54:33,640
And that is the second idea that has really, I kind of ran with for this show.

2312
01:54:33,640 --> 01:54:37,200
Now here we are after all of this, and there has been some really interesting things.

2313
01:54:37,200 --> 01:54:40,320
One of the things I really enjoyed, one of the things we did this year that I thought

2314
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:46,520
was kind of fun, is when we went to LinuxCon, we did Unplugged live from LinuxCon.

2315
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:51,920
And it was a little rough, because we literally just found a spot, and when we got there,

2316
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:55,240
I don't know if Noah wants me to tell the story, so nobody share this with Noah.

2317
01:54:55,240 --> 01:54:56,240
Don't tell Noah.

2318
01:54:56,240 --> 01:54:57,240
He won't listen to this episode.

2319
01:54:57,240 --> 01:54:58,240
He's got a family.

2320
01:54:58,240 --> 01:54:59,240
He doesn't listen to any of these.

2321
01:54:59,240 --> 01:55:00,240
No, he does.

2322
01:55:00,240 --> 01:55:01,240
He listens to Unplugged.

2323
01:55:01,240 --> 01:55:02,240
But come on, this is the Christmas episode.

2324
01:55:02,240 --> 01:55:03,240
Right.

2325
01:55:03,240 --> 01:55:04,240
He won't have time to listen to this.

2326
01:55:04,240 --> 01:55:05,240
Nope.

2327
01:55:05,240 --> 01:55:06,240
And he doesn't know I've been drinking beer.

2328
01:55:06,240 --> 01:55:10,920
So we get, we're at the Seattle Convention Center.

2329
01:55:10,920 --> 01:55:16,440
This is like a legit professional convention center, and there is an area they have where

2330
01:55:16,440 --> 01:55:21,280
they have these benches that have plugs and networking, and it's like the, you know, sit

2331
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:23,160
down at a workstation.

2332
01:55:23,160 --> 01:55:26,080
And there's like four of them, and they're in front of windows.

2333
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:27,980
They're nice, but they're all taken.

2334
01:55:27,980 --> 01:55:33,560
And so we get there, and I go, Noah, this was our last kind of plan, and all these spots

2335
01:55:33,560 --> 01:55:34,560
are taken.

2336
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:35,560
What do we do?

2337
01:55:35,560 --> 01:55:37,640
He's like, what do you mean, what do we do?

2338
01:55:37,640 --> 01:55:38,640
What do we do?

2339
01:55:38,640 --> 01:55:40,200
He's like, you start setting up.

2340
01:55:40,200 --> 01:55:41,880
I go, what do you mean you start setting up?

2341
01:55:41,880 --> 01:55:43,600
He says, you start setting up.

2342
01:55:43,600 --> 01:55:46,640
You start setting up, and they'll get out of the way.

2343
01:55:46,640 --> 01:55:51,080
Because we look so official with all this equipment, that once we start setting it down,

2344
01:55:51,080 --> 01:55:52,080
they get out of the way.

2345
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:53,880
And I'm like, that, that doesn't work.

2346
01:55:53,880 --> 01:55:55,920
And he's like, let's try it.

2347
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:59,840
So we go over there, and we bring over these, we have these Pelican cases, and we, we open

2348
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:03,280
them up, and we start setting up microphones and cameras and mixers, right?

2349
01:56:03,280 --> 01:56:06,760
And we start computers, and sure enough, everybody at the table just gets up and walks away.

2350
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:07,760
And they move to another table.

2351
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:10,960
They just totally got out of our way, and we were able to bull-regard this spot for

2352
01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:11,960
two hours.

2353
01:56:11,960 --> 01:56:16,580
We boondocked in this spot for two hours and managed to record the Linux Unplugged show.

2354
01:56:16,580 --> 01:56:23,040
And so we were able to do a live Linux Unplugged on location, and then we took prerecorded

2355
01:56:23,040 --> 01:56:26,680
material where we did interviews and recorded a bunch of stuff, and brought that into the

2356
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:29,960
Linux Action Show pre-produced, so it was really kind of more refined.

2357
01:56:29,960 --> 01:56:34,440
And I really liked that sort of ebb and flow between Unplugged and LAS this year, where

2358
01:56:34,440 --> 01:56:38,360
we went on location, did the live, raw, nitty-gritty stuff in Unplugged.

2359
01:56:38,360 --> 01:56:41,640
We were even able to bring the Mamba Room to the Linux convention with us, which was

2360
01:56:41,640 --> 01:56:42,960
totally badass.

2361
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:46,440
And then in LAS, we had the more refined, cut-down versions.

2362
01:56:46,440 --> 01:56:50,040
And I think that was kind of a cool thing that we, so I want to play with more of that

2363
01:56:50,040 --> 01:56:51,040
next year.

2364
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:52,040
Yeah.

2365
01:56:52,040 --> 01:56:53,040
It was kind of cool.

2366
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:54,040
The synchronicity between LAS and Unplugged.

2367
01:56:54,040 --> 01:56:55,040
That was nice.

2368
01:56:55,040 --> 01:56:58,480
And then last but not least, I think one of my favorite things about Linux Unplugged this

2369
01:56:58,480 --> 01:57:00,400
year, of course, was Wes joining the cast.

2370
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:01,400
Well, thank you, sir.

2371
01:57:01,400 --> 01:57:05,360
Yeah, it wasn't, you know, Wes, you've been a great addition, and you've had great contributions

2372
01:57:05,360 --> 01:57:06,360
to the show.

2373
01:57:06,360 --> 01:57:08,560
I'm very pleased to be here.

2374
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:09,560
And you usually bring beer.

2375
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:10,560
Hey.

2376
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:11,560
That doesn't hurt.

2377
01:57:11,560 --> 01:57:12,560
So that's pretty solid, too.

2378
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:16,640
And then, of course, last but not least, our Mumble Room.

2379
01:57:16,640 --> 01:57:18,120
Now we're going to have one more episode this year.

2380
01:57:18,120 --> 01:57:19,120
This isn't the last episode of the year.

2381
01:57:19,120 --> 01:57:20,780
Yes, please be here.

2382
01:57:20,780 --> 01:57:26,400
But if you want to get your crystal ball and be real prognosticating and sound super smart,

2383
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:31,200
or put yourself out on the line, join us for 1.25 in the Mumble Room.

2384
01:57:31,200 --> 01:57:33,560
Thank you, Mumble Room, though, for great contributions this year.

2385
01:57:33,560 --> 01:57:36,720
You guys, you know, playing back those clips, it's obvious you guys helped make the show.

2386
01:57:36,720 --> 01:57:37,720
Absolutely.

2387
01:57:37,720 --> 01:57:38,720
So it means a lot to us.

2388
01:57:38,720 --> 01:57:42,200
You can join us live over at jblive.tv, go to jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar to

2389
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:45,320
get it converted to your local time zone, linuxactionshow.reddit.com to submit content.

2390
01:57:45,320 --> 01:57:49,660
All right, everybody, thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

2391
01:57:49,660 --> 01:58:18,400
Have a great holiday, and we'll see you right back here next week.
