WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.720
Yes, I'm still using Gnome.

00:02.720 --> 00:04.120
Yes, but I've made decisions.

00:04.120 --> 00:06.360
Look at the, listen to the tone in that.

00:06.360 --> 00:08.920
I know, well it's because they're right and they know it's going to probably crash on

00:08.920 --> 00:12.760
me during this show and I should know better by now, but the thing is I've been stuck in

00:12.760 --> 00:17.080
Indecision Valley for so long and now I've come out the other side and I feel like I've

00:17.080 --> 00:20.360
seen the light and I've gotten a cold drink of water.

00:20.360 --> 00:23.040
Now I just have to reload all my systems.

00:23.040 --> 00:39.880
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 203 for June 27th, 2017.

00:39.880 --> 00:44.400
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that screens are covered in fingerprints.

00:44.400 --> 00:45.400
My name is Chris.

00:45.400 --> 00:46.400
My name is Wes.

00:46.400 --> 00:47.400
Hello, Wes.

00:47.400 --> 00:49.440
Yes, we have a touch screen powered machine.

00:49.440 --> 00:51.800
It's not powered by the touch screen, but it has a touch screen.

00:51.800 --> 00:52.800
Yeah, that's right.

00:52.800 --> 00:53.800
It's important that it does.

00:53.800 --> 00:54.800
Yeah.

00:54.800 --> 01:00.760
We'll be talking about this massive Dell Precision 5720 Linux rig.

01:00.760 --> 01:01.760
What?

01:01.760 --> 01:05.680
I'm going to say right now, not getting into performance or other things, but in terms

01:05.680 --> 01:09.220
of build quality, just probably one of the finest built machines running Linux on the

01:09.220 --> 01:10.220
market today.

01:10.220 --> 01:14.440
So we'll give you a review of that Xeon monster in a little bit, but before that, Wes, before

01:14.440 --> 01:18.320
that, we've got quite a bit of community news and updates to get into.

01:18.320 --> 01:20.480
An old friend is coming back from the dead.

01:20.480 --> 01:26.320
It's not quite dead yet, and you're not going to believe what Mir might be used for next.

01:26.320 --> 01:31.720
We'll give a plug for some upcoming open source events, a couple of new desktop application

01:31.720 --> 01:34.760
launches that look really, really good.

01:34.760 --> 01:39.780
Mozilla's $2 million bounty that, actually, I think a lot of folks in the audience could

01:39.780 --> 01:40.780
probably get.

01:40.780 --> 01:41.960
I think so, yeah.

01:41.960 --> 01:45.920
So we'll tell you about their kind of cool idea, a big problem that the Debian project

01:45.920 --> 01:46.920
has come across.

01:46.920 --> 01:47.920
Uh-oh.

01:47.920 --> 01:48.920
Yeah.

01:48.920 --> 01:49.920
Yeah.

01:49.920 --> 01:52.360
So we've got like all kinds of good stuff in here, Wes.

01:52.360 --> 01:56.760
It's been a very fruitful week for open source.

01:56.760 --> 02:00.480
So before we can get into any of that, we have to stop right here at the top of the

02:00.480 --> 02:02.660
show and bring in our virtual lug.

02:02.660 --> 02:04.600
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

02:04.600 --> 02:05.600
Greetings.

02:05.600 --> 02:06.600
Hello everybody.

02:06.600 --> 02:09.960
Well, look at that.

02:09.960 --> 02:11.220
We managed to get a pretty good turnout.

02:11.220 --> 02:12.220
You guys are the best.

02:12.220 --> 02:13.220
That's pretty nice.

02:13.220 --> 02:18.120
Hey guys, it's really good to see you all, and I want to probably start with the most

02:18.120 --> 02:22.960
newsworthy story, because in some ways, Linux is ahead of the rest.

02:22.960 --> 02:24.840
But we'll get to that in just a second.

02:24.840 --> 02:29.340
Intel has a bug, and it's in their Skylake and Kaby Lake processors.

02:29.340 --> 02:31.480
It's related to hyper-threading.

02:31.480 --> 02:35.560
So if you have hyper-threading turned on, an unfixed Skylake and Kaby Lake processor

02:35.560 --> 02:40.680
could, in some situations, dangerously misbehave when hyper-threading is enabled.

02:40.680 --> 02:43.780
If you disable hyper-threading immediately, you're safe.

02:43.780 --> 02:49.080
So this is on Debian's mailing list, is an advisory about processor and microcode defects

02:49.080 --> 02:53.560
recently identified on Intel Skylake and Intel Kaby Lake processors with hyper-threading

02:53.560 --> 02:54.560
enabled.

02:54.560 --> 02:57.620
The defect, when triggered, causes unpredictable system behavior.

02:57.620 --> 03:02.060
It could cause errors such as application and system misbehavior, data corruption, and

03:02.060 --> 03:03.060
even data loss.

03:03.060 --> 03:07.400
It was brought to the attention of the Debian project that this defect is known to directly

03:07.400 --> 03:12.460
affect some Debian stable users, thus the Debian advisory.

03:12.460 --> 03:14.920
Now what do you know about this story?

03:14.920 --> 03:15.920
It's interesting.

03:15.920 --> 03:21.120
You don't hear about these that often, at least not ones that are really big news like

03:21.120 --> 03:25.160
this or that are public outcries.

03:25.160 --> 03:30.660
The problem is that under complex microarchitectural conditions, short loops of less than 64 instructions

03:30.660 --> 03:36.560
that use AH, BH, CH, or DH registers, as well as their corresponding wider register, e.g.,

03:36.560 --> 03:42.560
AX, EIX, or AX for AH, may cause unpredictable system behavior.

03:42.560 --> 03:44.640
Yeah, obviously this isn't a Debian issue.

03:44.640 --> 03:47.560
This is an Intel microcode issue.

03:47.560 --> 03:51.100
So you know that proprietary Intel microcode that when you install Ubuntu and you go to

03:51.100 --> 03:56.580
additional drivers and it has this little checkbox where you can install the microcode?

03:56.580 --> 04:00.880
This is the kind of stuff that is, this is what the microcode is responsible for, and

04:00.880 --> 04:06.340
this is the kind of stuff that if you get new versions of the microcode, you get a patch.

04:06.340 --> 04:11.960
Also on Linux, like in the case of Debian here, for Debian they already have Intel microcode

04:11.960 --> 04:16.040
packages that are patched for Untable, for Unstable, they have them for testing, they

04:16.040 --> 04:19.520
have them for Debian 9, Debian 8 backports.

04:19.520 --> 04:22.800
So they've already fixed it in Debian and they're probably fixing it, I would imagine,

04:22.800 --> 04:27.080
in other distros too like Ubuntu, but you have to be installing this proprietary microcode

04:27.080 --> 04:28.760
package to get this.

04:28.760 --> 04:32.740
So this is one of the things your microcode, that weird crazy package does, and kind of

04:32.740 --> 04:37.120
related to all of this, you found this project, or at least this post this week, about trying

04:37.120 --> 04:43.080
to build a system where the Intel microcode could get uploaded directly from the Linux

04:43.080 --> 04:50.080
kernel to the processor and sort of eliminate the need for initramfs to do this.

04:50.080 --> 04:55.160
So Linux is maybe going to have a simpler way to update this stuff in the future via

04:55.160 --> 04:56.160
directly the kernel.

04:56.160 --> 04:57.160
Hey, that might be handy.

04:57.160 --> 05:01.720
It could be, yeah, because depending on how you're trying to build a system, you know,

05:01.720 --> 05:05.920
if you're trying to build it, basically, the goal here, the end goal they're trying to

05:05.920 --> 05:10.760
get to is a system that you can boot, a Linux system you can boot without any initramfs.

05:10.760 --> 05:17.400
I mean, really, initramfs, as handy as they are, and they are very fun, handy, useful,

05:17.400 --> 05:19.880
it's kind of a hack, you know.

05:19.880 --> 05:25.520
This microcode stuff, though, this flaw at the kernel level stuff, it's spooky because

05:25.520 --> 05:27.560
it means you're hooked on the sauce.

05:27.560 --> 05:30.960
You're hooked on the Intel microcode sauce if you want to get this fixed.

05:30.960 --> 05:35.880
And it's like, if you don't, well, okay, but in some conditions, you might trigger a crash.

05:35.880 --> 05:39.240
But you're already hooked on Intel-dependent software in the first place, like your whole

05:39.240 --> 05:43.720
BIOS spring-up process, all of your EFI services and things that run, you're already dependent

05:43.720 --> 05:46.440
on and really do need to be updated as well.

05:46.440 --> 05:51.400
And in most cases, machine vendors will release new BIOSes, and those contain microcodes.

05:51.400 --> 05:55.680
So if you get the newest BIOS for your machine, it's very likely that you could get the microcode

05:55.680 --> 05:59.240
that fixes this issue, like you're going to get the thing that you can load in Linux after

05:59.240 --> 06:00.240
the fact.

06:00.240 --> 06:03.720
But not all vendors do update their BIOSes, some of them let the language.

06:03.720 --> 06:06.920
So it's nice to do it in Linux because you know that you're going to get the microcode

06:06.920 --> 06:07.920
update applied.

06:07.920 --> 06:11.280
Otherwise, you're looking through change logs for each hardware iteration thing that you

06:11.280 --> 06:12.280
have.

06:12.280 --> 06:13.280
So William, you're completely right.

06:13.280 --> 06:16.100
And two things that jump out at me, though, is number one, like you said, not all vendors

06:16.100 --> 06:21.400
distribute BIOS images because sometimes their upstream ODM agreement doesn't permit them

06:21.400 --> 06:23.320
to redistribute BIOS updates.

06:23.320 --> 06:24.420
So there's that problem.

06:24.420 --> 06:28.720
But secondly, it seems to me the goal should always be to try to move away from things

06:28.720 --> 06:36.680
like requirements of microcode or uploading from Linux or like anything that's sort of

06:36.680 --> 06:37.680
non-transparent.

06:37.680 --> 06:42.560
Well, but if you don't have microcode, then you live with the defects the processor shipped

06:42.560 --> 06:43.560
in.

06:43.560 --> 06:44.560
And this would be one of those defects.

06:44.560 --> 06:48.440
This is what they didn't see this edge case when they built the processor and shipped

06:48.440 --> 06:49.440
the initial microcode.

06:49.440 --> 06:54.840
So the microcode fix that you get now distributed with your Linux distro fixes this issue, which

06:54.840 --> 06:55.840
you would just never fix otherwise.

06:55.840 --> 06:56.840
That's what I said.

06:56.840 --> 07:01.280
And I mean, it really highlights that like, you know, we're at that boundary of hardware

07:01.280 --> 07:02.280
and software.

07:02.280 --> 07:04.480
We're hooked on the good stuff.

07:04.480 --> 07:06.040
It's becoming more complicated.

07:06.040 --> 07:10.280
Like this is some weird L1 cache behavior with two different lengths of instruction

07:10.280 --> 07:13.360
or register modifying instructions.

07:13.360 --> 07:16.360
So William, do you have a kind of an idea of like how likely someone would be to actually

07:16.360 --> 07:17.360
trigger this?

07:17.360 --> 07:21.280
My understanding is you're probably not going to find it in your typical workflow.

07:21.280 --> 07:22.280
Yeah.

07:22.280 --> 07:23.280
It seems like if it took this long to come up.

07:23.280 --> 07:26.880
There's no generation that results in those instructions all fitting in the L1 cache and

07:26.880 --> 07:31.560
performing the behavior that results in triggering the bug.

07:31.560 --> 07:36.040
It sounds like this bug was maybe first found in the OCaml community and they kind of reported

07:36.040 --> 07:37.040
it.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.040
Yeah.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.040
It sounded like, yeah.

07:39.040 --> 07:42.280
So I think it also kind of highlights, there's just a lot we don't know about what's going

07:42.280 --> 07:43.280
on at the hardware layer.

07:43.280 --> 07:45.440
You know, it's like we're already running all this microcode.

07:45.440 --> 07:46.440
You don't know what it is.

07:46.440 --> 07:48.960
It's not very inspectable or suitable in any way.

07:48.960 --> 07:51.480
And then you have this kind of, I mean, you can go look on Hacker News and stuff, but

07:51.480 --> 07:52.480
the thread for this.

07:52.480 --> 07:54.680
There's a lot of people talking about, you know, questionable practices by hardware

07:54.680 --> 07:58.400
vendors around acknowledging hardware defects and how you do that because we don't have

07:58.400 --> 08:02.720
the same kind of tools we've come to expect in the open source software world for identifying

08:02.720 --> 08:04.320
and fixing these kinds of problems.

08:04.320 --> 08:06.240
But at least Intel does seem to publish the errata.

08:06.240 --> 08:10.040
Like I think there's a thing, there should be an errata listing for each of these generations

08:10.040 --> 08:11.040
of chips.

08:11.040 --> 08:14.520
So like for all the Skylake and Kaby Lake platforms, they have the errata published

08:14.520 --> 08:15.520
for these things.

08:15.520 --> 08:18.760
So you can go look up your chip and look at the errata and this will be in there.

08:18.760 --> 08:19.760
Yeah.

08:19.760 --> 08:24.720
I mean, as the chips are becoming more complex, the errata is becoming much larger.

08:24.720 --> 08:27.840
So you're going to see a bunch more of these issues show up because chips are just becoming

08:27.840 --> 08:30.000
increasingly more complex and hard to validate.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
I got to be honest.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.640
I really thought when I went back in the day when hyper-threading first was announced as

08:35.640 --> 08:38.360
a thing, I thought, well, that sounds like a damn hack.

08:38.360 --> 08:40.920
And you know, we really haven't really had much fallout from it.

08:40.920 --> 08:44.200
I mean, it's not the best thing ever, but it's kind of funny.

08:44.200 --> 08:48.800
So I guess one immediate fix would be to just go turn off hyper-threading in your bios.

08:48.800 --> 08:52.840
So old school skeptical admin Chris was like, yeah, just turn hyper-threading off.

08:52.840 --> 08:53.840
Just it's fine.

08:53.840 --> 08:58.040
What's funny is it's only this implementation in Skylake onward that's broken, it's not

08:58.040 --> 08:59.040
the older implementations.

08:59.040 --> 09:00.040
Right.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.040
Yeah, right.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.040
Skylake and Kaby Lake, they're the chips that...

09:02.040 --> 09:08.720
And I guess that would mean that the chips came after Skylake and Kaby Lake maybe also

09:08.720 --> 09:09.720
have different types of hyper-threading?

09:09.720 --> 09:14.560
My understanding is it's some caching behavior, I think, of the micro-instructions and that

09:14.560 --> 09:18.200
interacted with hyper-threading in such a way that you got this effect where you have

09:18.200 --> 09:22.960
multiple logical streams happening simultaneously and some kind of corruption happening.

09:22.960 --> 09:23.960
Whoops.

09:23.960 --> 09:24.960
So interesting.

09:24.960 --> 09:25.960
Yeah, it's hard.

09:25.960 --> 09:30.800
It's a system that's hard to do integration testing on because as you add these features

09:30.800 --> 09:35.940
that seem like they gain you performance, they can interact in just really unsuspecting

09:35.940 --> 09:38.440
ways with other features you added before.

09:38.440 --> 09:43.360
But the sort of cherry on top for Linux users is it looks like a fix, I would imagine for

09:43.360 --> 09:47.800
both, I guess Max too, but I saw, I read somewhere that Microsoft won't have a fix for quite

09:47.800 --> 09:48.800
a bit coming down.

09:48.800 --> 09:52.120
My understanding was Microsoft already released the microcode update at least for the Skylake

09:52.120 --> 09:53.120
chips.

09:53.120 --> 09:54.120
I don't know about the Kaby Lake microcode.

09:54.120 --> 09:55.120
Okay, that was...

09:55.120 --> 09:56.120
Because what I was reading is it looked like it would be included in...

09:56.120 --> 09:57.120
But I have read it was in the April rollup.

09:57.120 --> 09:58.120
Oh, no.

09:58.120 --> 09:59.120
So what I was reading would be...

09:59.120 --> 10:00.120
But that may only be for Windows 10.

10:00.120 --> 10:01.120
Ah, okay.

10:01.120 --> 10:02.960
So what I was reading would be included as an update after summer.

10:02.960 --> 10:03.960
But I don't know.

10:03.960 --> 10:06.240
So I really didn't follow that closely because I couldn't really care.

10:06.240 --> 10:10.720
But what I thought was, boy, what an interesting contrast though that I could have seen a time

10:10.720 --> 10:15.160
where Linux would be maybe just completely SOL or totally, totally out of luck on something

10:15.160 --> 10:16.160
like this.

10:16.160 --> 10:22.040
Yeah, the Linux kernel has had the updating support for years, I want to say at least

10:22.040 --> 10:23.040
five years.

10:23.040 --> 10:25.560
Intel's been in there working with the Linux kernel community for years now.

10:25.560 --> 10:29.000
It's just a matter of actually having the proprietary package and then deal it, depending

10:29.000 --> 10:32.600
on your distro, whether you have the update functionality because you may choose to go

10:32.600 --> 10:35.880
with Libre only stuff, in which case you're not going to update the microcode.

10:35.880 --> 10:36.880
Exactly.

10:36.880 --> 10:38.760
So just disable hyperthreading, I guess.

10:38.760 --> 10:39.760
Or don't worry about it.

10:39.760 --> 10:40.760
Or update your microcode.

10:40.760 --> 10:45.360
Yeah, back up, back up often and see if there's another way to update the microcode.

10:45.360 --> 10:46.360
Yeah.

10:46.360 --> 10:47.360
See, the thing is that...

10:47.360 --> 10:50.960
So, William, maybe you can clear this up because what my understanding was is the microcode

10:50.960 --> 10:52.920
with this fix has to be uploaded at every boot.

10:52.920 --> 10:55.680
You can't write it to this processor.

10:55.680 --> 10:56.680
That is correct.

10:56.680 --> 10:57.840
The microcode has...

10:57.840 --> 11:01.840
There's a ROM on the processor that contains the microcode shipped from the factory.

11:01.840 --> 11:05.680
But the microcode updates you apply are applied at runtime every time they're not persisted

11:05.680 --> 11:06.680
on the chip.

11:06.680 --> 11:07.680
Yeah.

11:07.680 --> 11:08.680
So how do you...

11:08.680 --> 11:11.500
And I think that's actually kind of a good thing because if you uploaded a bad microcode,

11:11.500 --> 11:12.500
you could break your chip.

11:12.500 --> 11:13.500
Sure.

11:13.500 --> 11:17.080
But if it comes from the factory working, you know it's going to continue working.

11:17.080 --> 11:21.120
So if you update the microcode and it broke, you can just reboot and do it again.

11:21.120 --> 11:22.120
So how does the...

11:22.120 --> 11:23.120
That is the nice thing about this process.

11:23.120 --> 11:25.800
How does a Triskel user do this, handle this problem?

11:25.800 --> 11:29.080
The Triskel user could update their BIOS since they're probably...

11:29.080 --> 11:30.860
Maybe they're using a proprietary BIOS.

11:30.860 --> 11:33.960
If they're not, then maybe, I don't know, they're just screwed.

11:33.960 --> 11:37.360
They have to accept that they need some binary to be loaded onto the CPU.

11:37.360 --> 11:40.400
Stop running that horrible closed source x86 platform.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.400
Yeah.

11:41.400 --> 11:47.280
But yeah, if you're on Skylake or newer, I think you're basically stuck with proprietary

11:47.280 --> 11:50.360
code that runs at boot so you can do the microcode update.

11:50.360 --> 11:54.280
You're just going to have to deal with yet another proprietary process.

11:54.280 --> 11:59.200
So it looks like it hasn't been released for Windows yet, but I'm sure they'll get updates

11:59.200 --> 12:01.600
out eventually.

12:01.600 --> 12:02.600
You sound so confident.

12:02.600 --> 12:03.600
Yeah.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.160
Now, how about this for a story?

12:05.160 --> 12:06.160
You guys ready for this?

12:06.160 --> 12:10.360
Now, I'm going to ask you something before I get through this whole thing.

12:10.360 --> 12:12.440
Please stick with me on this, okay?

12:12.440 --> 12:14.080
But it's not dead yet.

12:14.080 --> 12:20.680
Mir may live on as a Wayland compositor for the Mate desktop.

12:20.680 --> 12:21.680
Say that again?

12:21.680 --> 12:22.680
Just one more time.

12:22.680 --> 12:23.680
One more time.

12:23.680 --> 12:24.680
Mir.

12:24.680 --> 12:25.680
Yeah.

12:25.680 --> 12:29.280
Canonical's display server project, which was going to ship as the default in Ubuntu

12:29.280 --> 12:37.960
13.10, which is very optimistic, is actually, despite what people believe, still under active

12:37.960 --> 12:40.600
development, I've been watching, it's still getting commits.

12:40.600 --> 12:46.120
And so this week, friend of the show, Martin Wimpress, suggested that Mate developers could

12:46.120 --> 12:51.640
be talking to Mir developers about how Mir might be used as a Wayland compositor.

12:51.640 --> 12:52.640
And I believe, yeah.

12:52.640 --> 12:53.640
Yeah, here it is.

12:53.640 --> 12:54.640
I have it.

12:54.640 --> 12:58.400
He posted a shot on the Google Plus stream somewhere.

12:58.400 --> 12:59.400
I'm not sure.

12:59.400 --> 13:00.400
I can't remember where it was.

13:00.400 --> 13:01.400
He was on one of those places.

13:01.400 --> 13:04.720
And you could see a whiteboard of how they were kind of conceptualizing this thing out.

13:04.720 --> 13:07.780
So here's the kind of the important thing to take away.

13:07.780 --> 13:11.280
Remember that Wayland itself isn't a display server.

13:11.280 --> 13:16.920
It's a protocol that handles the communication between a compositor, like Mudder, or Weston,

13:16.920 --> 13:17.920
or KWin.

13:17.920 --> 13:21.120
A thing that actually spits things to the screen.

13:21.120 --> 13:22.120
Right.

13:22.120 --> 13:25.440
And its clients, like the applications and the windows and stuff like that.

13:25.440 --> 13:32.880
So Mate doesn't necessarily have something that speaks the Wayland protocol.

13:32.880 --> 13:37.600
So they would have to build that in to the Mate back end.

13:37.600 --> 13:41.800
And so Wimpy points out that migrating to Wayland is something that the Mate desktop

13:41.800 --> 13:42.800
is going to have to do.

13:42.800 --> 13:43.800
Right.

13:43.800 --> 13:44.800
That's just something that's going to have to happen at some point.

13:44.800 --> 13:45.800
That ship has sailed.

13:45.800 --> 13:51.160
And they could add Wayland support to Marco.

13:51.160 --> 13:52.160
But it'd be a huge undertaking.

13:52.160 --> 13:54.440
They could switch to Mudder.

13:54.440 --> 13:57.480
But Gnome Shell, I've covered some of my concerns with Mudder recently.

13:57.480 --> 14:01.320
I mean, that has a lot of caveats as well, as Joey points out on OMG Ubuntu.

14:01.320 --> 14:06.800
So using Mir as the Wayland compositor.

14:06.800 --> 14:12.000
So they're going to teach Mir to speak Wayland.

14:12.000 --> 14:17.480
Mir will act as like a set of APIs that developers can write to, that then we'll be able to understand

14:17.480 --> 14:19.720
and can speak the way to speak Wayland.

14:19.720 --> 14:22.200
It'll be the Wayland compositor.

14:22.200 --> 14:25.100
And Wimpy says that, yeah, it's a chunk of work.

14:25.100 --> 14:31.520
But it's less work than rewriting Marco or switching over to, say, Mudder.

14:31.520 --> 14:33.440
It's like it's probably-

14:33.440 --> 14:35.400
Even without explicit Wayland support.

14:35.400 --> 14:39.640
Mir is closer to what they want than something like Mudder or Kaywin.

14:39.640 --> 14:42.040
Now I'm going to take this a step further.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.800
And I think this is where this should go.

14:43.800 --> 14:47.600
I think this should go across every distribution.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.720
This should not be an Ubuntu-only thing.

14:49.720 --> 14:56.280
This should be how almost every desktop environment on Linux speaks Wayland, with the exception

14:56.280 --> 15:01.420
of the really big boys and girls like Kaywin and your Mudders out there, who already are

15:01.420 --> 15:06.840
working on this and already have pretty solid support and have very special use cases.

15:06.840 --> 15:10.120
But here's the reality.

15:10.120 --> 15:16.500
Without something like Mir that does a standard API that everybody can write to, without something

15:16.500 --> 15:22.280
like Mir, every single Tom, Dick, and Harry desktop environment is going to have to create

15:22.280 --> 15:24.480
their own Wayland compositor.

15:24.480 --> 15:29.240
And it's going to be this patchwork of features and support that's going to fragment the Linux

15:29.240 --> 15:32.800
desktop in a way that we've never even considered fragmentation before.

15:32.800 --> 15:38.760
We think of fragmentation as package managers or library versions or system D or no system

15:38.760 --> 15:45.040
D. But true fragmentation will be copy and paste, highlights, screenshot capabilities,

15:45.040 --> 15:51.880
remote desktop capabilities, support of communicating between X applications and Wayland applications

15:51.880 --> 15:57.160
could be different depending on which desktop environment you're using, depending on which

15:57.160 --> 16:00.620
Linux you're running on top of, depending on which version of Linux you're running on

16:00.620 --> 16:01.620
top of.

16:01.620 --> 16:07.200
It is going to be a layer on top of layer on top of layer fragmentation.

16:07.200 --> 16:11.000
If each one of these Tom, Dick, and Harry desktop environments have to go out and figure

16:11.000 --> 16:16.120
out their own way to communicate with Wayland and not to mention all the stuff still new.

16:16.120 --> 16:19.840
So not only is it going to be rough because it's brand new code, but it's going to be

16:19.840 --> 16:24.440
rough because all of these amateur projects are creating their own implementation from

16:24.440 --> 16:25.440
scratch.

16:25.440 --> 16:27.560
It's devastating in terms of usability.

16:27.560 --> 16:34.580
So to have something that is well developed in a company that is familiar with the problem

16:34.580 --> 16:38.960
set that is trying to solve it for their own desktop interests that can create a common

16:38.960 --> 16:44.040
API that desktop environments could just adopt across all Linux could save us from what is

16:44.040 --> 16:47.440
going to be years of fragmentation hell.

16:47.440 --> 16:51.340
Or it's just going to raise the bar.

16:51.340 --> 16:56.600
It's going to raise the bar way too high for entry for desktop projects because now you

16:56.600 --> 16:57.600
don't get X.

16:57.600 --> 16:58.600
You don't get the X server.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.920
So you've got to write all that stuff on your own.

17:00.920 --> 17:05.280
You've got to do all of that legwork now to get your desktop environment up and running

17:05.280 --> 17:10.760
on a Wayland powered Linux desktop or you've got to fork somebody else's open source project.

17:10.760 --> 17:13.860
And that is a way bigger bar of entry than it used to be.

17:13.860 --> 17:18.920
So we are in a sense locking the Linux desktop to the establishment projects that have the

17:18.920 --> 17:26.160
resources, the know-how, the technical understanding of how to build a display compositor and

17:26.160 --> 17:29.200
we are limited to those projects that are going to be able to do something that's actually

17:29.200 --> 17:34.580
usable on desktop unless we have something like this that multiple communities and multiple

17:34.580 --> 17:37.600
distributions and multiple desktop environments are all working towards.

17:37.600 --> 17:39.040
At least that's how I see it.

17:39.040 --> 17:42.120
And it's one of the things that concerns me about the future of desktop Linux the most

17:42.120 --> 17:43.760
and it's something we're barely talking about.

17:43.760 --> 17:49.200
So it sounds like to me you're calling kind of for like a bog standard display server

17:49.200 --> 17:50.200
for Wayland.

17:50.200 --> 17:55.720
I'm calling for like a common API set where you know this version of the API has these

17:55.720 --> 17:56.720
capabilities.

17:56.720 --> 17:57.720
I can take screenshots.

17:57.720 --> 17:58.720
I have copy and paste.

17:58.720 --> 17:59.720
Well there you go.

17:59.720 --> 18:03.240
So that's the thing and I wish this article had talked more about that is because like

18:03.240 --> 18:06.240
it's not that Wayland doesn't have those issues that they're different levels of abstraction

18:06.240 --> 18:07.600
and you have different capabilities, right?

18:07.600 --> 18:09.200
So it doesn't provide those things.

18:09.200 --> 18:13.720
Well and right and different projects are at different points of progress in implementing

18:13.720 --> 18:14.720
those features.

18:14.720 --> 18:15.720
Right.

18:15.720 --> 18:21.320
So just because so just because the KWin display compositor is now making it possible to take

18:21.320 --> 18:24.200
screenshots doesn't mean that Mudder can do it.

18:24.200 --> 18:28.160
And so you could you could literally have a reality where you can have some basic desktop

18:28.160 --> 18:32.920
functionality not work simply because that project hasn't gotten around to making that

18:32.920 --> 18:33.920
work yet on Wayland.

18:33.920 --> 18:34.920
Right.

18:34.920 --> 18:38.520
So this would almost be like a like a desktop API where something especially like you know

18:38.520 --> 18:43.080
for Monte or things like that like this reminds me in some ways of Vulkan and you know we're

18:43.080 --> 18:47.180
like we have this newer layer where we give more power right so like if you are a big

18:47.180 --> 18:49.960
project you want to be able to implement those things because you're like well X does this

18:49.960 --> 18:53.240
terribly I'm always gonna get screen tearing and all these problems let me fix that in

18:53.240 --> 18:57.200
KWin and we're gonna get it right and we're gonna have buttery smooth super great compositing

18:57.200 --> 19:01.080
but as you're saying a lot of pressure is like well I just wanted to make a cool tiling

19:01.080 --> 19:02.920
window manager that did things a little differently.

19:02.920 --> 19:04.880
Is XFCE gonna adopt KWin?

19:04.880 --> 19:05.880
Not likely.

19:05.880 --> 19:06.880
Yes.

19:06.880 --> 19:10.240
So what you're saying is like well if you can surrender some of that control we need

19:10.240 --> 19:13.480
something that can be that middle layer so that you can be like hey I just want to take

19:13.480 --> 19:17.240
a screenshot I don't care how you do it go talk to Wayland for me help me a little bit

19:17.240 --> 19:19.800
with those middle layers I don't need to deviate from that.

19:19.800 --> 19:23.520
You still have to build some of the hooks and support into your desktop environment but

19:23.520 --> 19:27.380
this is what you write to and if you write to this version of the API you will get these

19:27.380 --> 19:28.380
things.

19:28.380 --> 19:31.220
And I imagine like I think the other thing I'd like to see more of is the comparison

19:31.220 --> 19:34.720
to Mudder because I understand the concerns like it's not I don't but I think that it

19:34.720 --> 19:38.640
would be good to have those spelled out and I think part of it may be too like that like

19:38.640 --> 19:42.860
Gnome the Gnome project doesn't really think of Mudder as that as the thing that you're

19:42.860 --> 19:47.280
describing you know whereas Mirror kind of doesn't have a home as much anymore or it's

19:47.280 --> 19:50.280
right you know the state of transition so maybe this is something it really could excel

19:50.280 --> 19:51.280
at.

19:51.280 --> 19:55.960
Yeah and why toss out good code and if it can be open sourced and you know I would love

19:55.960 --> 19:59.120
to also know what the situation is with the CLA when it comes to Mirror and if it could

19:59.120 --> 20:00.120
you know.

20:00.120 --> 20:01.120
That's a good question.

20:01.120 --> 20:04.120
You know would it have to be moved off of Launchpad and put up on GitHub really to get

20:04.120 --> 20:05.440
real community involvement.

20:05.440 --> 20:07.920
These are all questions you'd have to ask and maybe we'll get somebody on here and they

20:07.920 --> 20:10.660
can answer some of those questions but I think interesting though.

20:10.660 --> 20:14.320
Yeah I think the concept is worth considering and if you hear the name Mirror getting kicked

20:14.320 --> 20:19.920
around again in community forums and discussion places I'd say don't don't don't dismiss it

20:19.920 --> 20:23.000
out of hand give it some consideration because there's a real problem here that we're going

20:23.000 --> 20:28.160
to be facing and this could be solving the problem before we even start to struggle with

20:28.160 --> 20:29.160
it.

20:29.160 --> 20:33.480
Not that we can't engineer our way out of it once we're there but it would it be amazing

20:33.480 --> 20:35.760
if we just hit the ground running with the solution.

20:35.760 --> 20:36.760
That would be amazing.

20:36.760 --> 20:37.960
What a what a concept.

20:37.960 --> 20:41.960
This is so neat this solves some problems I had just this weekend Eternal Terminal.

20:41.960 --> 20:45.780
Wes found this and it's a remote terminal for the busy and impatient.

20:45.780 --> 20:50.240
It combines like some of the aspects of MOSH which is the popular terminal we've talked

20:50.240 --> 20:53.320
about before Auto SSH and SSH.

20:53.320 --> 20:57.640
The whole idea here is that it'll reconnect without interrupting the session and it uses

20:57.640 --> 20:59.960
some fancy TCP to do it too Wes.

20:59.960 --> 21:04.920
I was looking at it that's kind of part of its secret sauce is as the they kind of break

21:04.920 --> 21:10.120
it all down in the how it works section but they say the eternal TCP is a layer between

21:10.120 --> 21:16.760
the application and the Unix TCP sockets that make the sockets robust to TCP disconnects

21:16.760 --> 21:21.360
including roaming and connection failure and they go into why that's actually particularly

21:21.360 --> 21:25.880
hard thing to do and how they came up with a reader and a writer and.

21:25.880 --> 21:30.920
Yeah I think this is really interesting and it kind of I've liked MOSH but there are they

21:30.920 --> 21:33.880
talk about them here a lot you know it's like the MOSH does have some limitations especially

21:33.880 --> 21:38.000
how you know MOSH only tries to communicate the current state of the screen.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.840
It doesn't it's not it's very different than how we traditionally have had these kinds

21:40.840 --> 21:45.120
of connections and this is seems like it's you know it doesn't have quite all the capabilities

21:45.120 --> 21:50.680
it has some different drawbacks and limitations but if you're just tired of you know my internet

21:50.680 --> 21:54.600
went out or you know just be able to go from one network to another and then having that

21:54.600 --> 21:58.600
SSH connection reestablished come back up and you don't lose your place.

21:58.600 --> 21:59.600
That's awesome.

21:59.600 --> 22:04.480
I mean again I think that it's you know if you can use screen or Tmux then maybe you

22:04.480 --> 22:07.900
don't have this problem as much and it's not that big of a deal but it can be a layer of

22:07.900 --> 22:12.920
convenience and I think it's really good software engineering to try.

22:12.920 --> 22:17.000
So it's something I'll definitely try out because this weekend I had a multi-day benchmark

22:17.000 --> 22:20.920
running in an SSH session and it was over the gigabit LAN so I was like this is good

22:20.920 --> 22:25.160
this is solid I mean these never these sessions I have running for days they never.

22:25.160 --> 22:28.120
Yeah it died and of course the the whole the whole thing just died.

22:28.120 --> 22:31.480
Bummer I thought and then you linked this to me I was like oh I could have used that

22:31.480 --> 22:32.480
just a few hours ago.

22:32.480 --> 22:33.480
Where were you earlier?

22:33.480 --> 22:38.200
I want to give a quick shout out to odd camp 17 which is coming up very soon you can find

22:38.200 --> 22:45.520
out more at oddcamp.org Saturday August 19th and Sunday August 20th 2017 in Caltonbury

22:45.520 --> 22:47.080
I think that's how you say it right?

22:47.080 --> 22:48.080
Canterbury?

22:48.080 --> 22:49.080
Something like that.

22:49.080 --> 22:54.320
In the UK which looks like a lot of fun doesn't it yeah if you're over on the better spoken

22:54.320 --> 22:55.320
side of the pond.

22:55.320 --> 22:56.800
We're flying over right?

22:56.800 --> 23:02.080
I wish man I wish also a tip of the hat to Entraware for being like a platinum sponsor

23:02.080 --> 23:06.420
over there which is really cool to see them stepping up the community support and odd

23:06.420 --> 23:11.080
camp is an unconference celebrating free culture free and open source software hardware hacking

23:11.080 --> 23:15.880
digital rights all the things we love talking about on this show so you can find out more

23:15.880 --> 23:23.880
at oddcamp.org and again August 19th and the 20th that's awesome and then next week very

23:23.880 --> 23:29.480
soon our virtual log some of you become an actual log you're gonna come here to the studio

23:29.480 --> 23:34.560
you know we have this thing set to 12 that's probably pretty good that's probably pretty

23:34.560 --> 23:39.040
good and you and you and Dan are doing a double of the text nap so we could even go long yeah

23:39.040 --> 23:43.980
we can totally go long cool so yeah next week is the is the barbecue here at the studio

23:43.980 --> 23:48.320
to celebrate episode 200 I'm excited me too I'm not gonna eat for the whole next week

23:48.320 --> 23:55.120
I'm thinking like okay I better get an extra tank of propane gonna bring over maybe a charcoal

23:55.120 --> 24:00.660
barbecue gotta make sure the sous vide machine is prepared I guess we gotta think about sides

24:00.660 --> 24:04.080
too cuz I feel like I've only thought about which is not that that's bad that's the important

24:04.080 --> 24:08.960
part but Hadeen is thinking about making like an ambrosia salad so that could be one side

24:08.960 --> 24:13.200
but yeah we need like beans and stuff we got a couple of chairs in here I figured we'll

24:13.200 --> 24:16.240
have the mumble room a couple chairs that people come in here we'll chat it'll be good

24:16.240 --> 24:20.320
it'll be a lot of fun meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting to sign up if you can make it

24:20.320 --> 24:23.240
next week I don't know how we're gonna stream I still haven't figured that out I'm like

24:23.240 --> 24:26.640
just gonna take that right up to the red line and then figure that out the last minute I

24:26.640 --> 24:30.600
guess in true JB style originally I was gonna vlog the whole thing and then just do a big

24:30.600 --> 24:35.000
release but then it's not fun I know but then I'll live the in all of the material we put

24:35.000 --> 24:39.160
publicly it said well live stream and I'm like oh shit okay well we're live streaming

24:39.160 --> 24:44.080
it then we're doing a live meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting if you can make it and

24:44.080 --> 24:49.600
the meetup will be here at the studio so hopefully you know it's right up just a would you say

24:49.600 --> 24:57.160
Wes how many minutes up around noon or say around 11 on a Tuesday is it from Seattle

24:57.160 --> 25:01.480
it's a drive you probably make semi-frequently so yeah it's probably like depending on traffic

25:01.480 --> 25:05.400
like 45 minutes 40 minutes plan for like a 45 50 minute drive to make it up here from

25:05.400 --> 25:09.680
Seattle yeah from the Seattle area that's but it's it's a nice drive it's worth it is

25:09.680 --> 25:13.000
just the burbs of Seattle are we in the burbs getting that way you know when you live in

25:13.000 --> 25:16.440
the burbs you don't really consider is it because like outside of the cities the suburbs

25:16.440 --> 25:21.640
right you know you don't think of it as the burbs and you live in the burbs yeah I guess

25:21.640 --> 25:26.160
I mean you might be like you could think of Everett as a Seattle suburb and then yeah

25:26.160 --> 25:31.600
like a suburb of Everett no no no I reject that I was gonna skip over that middle section

25:31.600 --> 25:35.520
here's the thing to like when I travel and people say where you from say Seattle yeah

25:35.520 --> 25:40.560
you say yeah that's what everybody knows yeah it doesn't like and when you're like to you

25:40.560 --> 25:44.960
know you know even like even 500 miles away when you're like 2,000 miles away or 3000

25:44.960 --> 25:49.680
but even like 500 miles away like it like the nuance of the difference between Seattle

25:49.680 --> 25:55.080
anywhere else is totally is lost so yeah all right well let's take a moment and let's thank

25:55.080 --> 25:59.720
Ting for sponsoring this episode of the unplugged program go to linux.ting.com not only is that

25:59.720 --> 26:04.360
a powerful URL that you want in your history but it's also the way to support the show

26:04.360 --> 26:08.820
and get $25 off a Ting device they got a lot of great devices that you can buy directly

26:08.820 --> 26:15.120
from Ting no contract no other termination fee no weird quote-unquote agreements hate

26:15.120 --> 26:19.960
those you can also just bring a device and then get a Ting service credit now I did that

26:19.960 --> 26:22.740
that's how I got started with Ting I was like I'm gonna be a little skeptical and dip my

26:22.740 --> 26:26.880
toe in here a dip my toe in the water I brought a device so I got $25 service credit and that

26:26.880 --> 26:32.360
thing lasted me more than my first month and I realized oh man something shifted here because

26:32.360 --> 26:36.200
you're just paying for what you use your minutes your messages and your megabytes and that's

26:36.200 --> 26:41.800
it it's just six dollars for a line so if you use say 15 text messages you just pay

26:41.800 --> 26:46.060
for the 15 that you have to use instead of like having to pay for like a plan that gives

26:46.060 --> 26:50.680
you 800 texts just in case you use this it's all kind of silly it's all kind of arbitrary

26:50.680 --> 26:55.360
it's all just really a scam and Ting is here to make mobile simple and make sense that's

26:55.360 --> 27:00.120
why there's no contracts you pay for what you use they have nationwide coverage you're

27:00.120 --> 27:06.380
in control with their awesome dashboard they have tons of nice devices and a CDMA network

27:06.380 --> 27:10.840
and a GSM network which means not only is that a ton of devices you can bring but that

27:10.840 --> 27:14.560
gives you flexibility down the road too when you're traveling I use that all the time I

27:14.560 --> 27:18.880
bring a CDMA phone with me and I bring a GSM either hotspot or phone with me to one or

27:18.880 --> 27:22.720
the other so I can always have good network signal wherever I'm going because it's just

27:22.720 --> 27:26.400
different areas they different companies different have different agreements with different cities

27:26.400 --> 27:29.120
and you just never know you're looking to move or something and you don't want to change

27:29.120 --> 27:33.480
carriers like that's the last thing you want yeah yeah yeah when I when when we did the

27:33.480 --> 27:37.160
shows back at the house I had CDMA coverage there that was really great when we moved

27:37.160 --> 27:41.320
here I got just a slightly still great coverage on CDMA but I got just faster data on the

27:41.320 --> 27:44.460
GSM network I switched to the GSM you don't have to do you don't have new accounts there's

27:44.460 --> 27:48.000
no canceling or sign up you just and it's one of those things where you never have to

27:48.000 --> 27:52.760
think about it if you're if you're not like a like a geek if you are a geeky you know

27:52.760 --> 27:55.840
what those things are it's great that you have that flexibility check them out go to

27:55.840 --> 28:02.800
linux.ting.com and save a little money support the show and get started with a better way

28:02.800 --> 28:07.720
to do mobile linux.ting.com linux.ting.com thanks to ting for sponsoring the unplugged

28:07.720 --> 28:12.560
program one of my favorite open source desktop applications admittedly because I have the

28:12.560 --> 28:18.600
cutest kids on the entire planet hashtag bias digicam has a new update digicam 5.6 and this

28:18.600 --> 28:23.240
is the thing here that I was I always wanted this because when I want to share my photos

28:23.240 --> 28:25.800
like oh look at this really cute thing my kids did because they're the cutest kids in

28:25.800 --> 28:29.580
the entire world I think I mentioned that but I didn't really want to like throw up

28:29.580 --> 28:33.460
a whole gallery on google photos and share it with family or what other photo sharing

28:33.460 --> 28:37.720
services are there flicker still the thing I don't know it's weird and it's like well

28:37.720 --> 28:41.840
what am I what am I really what do you know why so this is a problem that is now solved

28:41.840 --> 28:46.340
in digicam 5.6 which is what I really I wanted to call out this feature it's a new html gallery

28:46.340 --> 28:50.720
tool that lets you quickly generate a web gallery from a set of albums or you know just

28:50.720 --> 28:54.360
a couple of photos and then they get immediately uploaded online you can show them to friends

28:54.360 --> 28:58.360
and family and then there's also a tool built in there they'll take a slideshow and just

28:58.360 --> 29:02.120
create a video that you can share so instead of trying to figure out wow yeah so instead

29:02.120 --> 29:05.760
of having to figure out how to do the slideshow thing it'll which this is a common question

29:05.760 --> 29:10.080
my family has so this is this is gonna be my go-to answer now is just use this digicam

29:10.080 --> 29:14.760
program it'll you know you build the slideshow and it will generate a video for you you just

29:14.760 --> 29:19.160
email me your mp4 and we'll all be fine you know my aunts and stuff are gonna be putting

29:19.160 --> 29:23.720
that up on facebook the moment that feature yeah and then for us geeks you're gonna love

29:23.720 --> 29:29.360
this digicam 5.6 comes with improvements for database backends and support for mysql databases

29:29.360 --> 29:34.440
so not only sqlites hey you got a real database yeah we're almost real i mean it's you know

29:34.440 --> 29:38.480
when you got a lot of photos or what i was i and i think somebody told me that their

29:38.480 --> 29:43.360
setup was like this once is a shared freaking mysql database between your machines yeah

29:43.360 --> 29:47.220
there you go right you just have one put the photos like on an nfs mount you put the database

29:47.220 --> 29:52.200
on a mysql server you throw you need the high availability digicam because you need to edit

29:52.200 --> 29:56.880
at any time well to tell you the truth this problem yeah right i hate having like some

29:56.880 --> 30:00.080
of my photos on one machine that's one of the things google photos it was really appealing

30:00.080 --> 30:04.120
is i could just put them google photos could be the canonical master source but i want

30:04.120 --> 30:08.880
the actual files on my file system and so digicam sort of that nice middle layer because

30:08.880 --> 30:12.280
when i want the photo experience digicam is there but i know in the back end they're on

30:12.280 --> 30:17.680
the file system throw it on a nas shared mysql database if i had an afternoon man i'd i would

30:17.680 --> 30:21.120
seriously consider it i also love that the html expert like you were talking about that

30:21.120 --> 30:25.720
is neat so like you could just go throw that on s3 or whatever or digital oceans new object

30:25.720 --> 30:29.520
storage and then just go run a website that way huh you know the other thing too i'll

30:29.520 --> 30:34.160
just mention i know for the paranoid this is not your top feature but for those of us

30:34.160 --> 30:38.640
that leave the gps coordinate taggings on for the phones that support it they've brought

30:38.640 --> 30:43.080
back the feature to show like where your photos are taken on a map stuff oh neat yeah always

30:43.080 --> 30:46.960
fun with the kids it's always fun let's talk about this particular one in a mumble room

30:46.960 --> 30:50.360
if anybody wants to jump in on this story in fact i'd like to actually maybe we'll toss

30:50.360 --> 30:52.800
some of this to the mumble room because i'd like to hear their ideas on how they would

30:52.800 --> 30:58.760
do this so prepare your minds because mozilla wants to give you two million dollars upfront

30:58.760 --> 31:03.120
right like they'll just give it to me and then maybe i give them deliver no uh damn

31:03.120 --> 31:07.920
no the two million dollars do they need my p-mail address yes or your bitcoin address

31:07.920 --> 31:12.040
maybe i'm not sure chris it's all about ethereum these days come on i know that's what everybody

31:12.040 --> 31:18.520
tells me uh except for i can't i can't i can't get into that uh so this is uh really it's

31:18.520 --> 31:23.080
a prize to decentralize the web and they're looking for people to apply today mozilla

31:23.080 --> 31:27.400
and the national science foundation are oh okay it's also the national science foundation

31:27.400 --> 31:32.920
are offering a two million dollar prize for big ideas that decentralizes the web and they're

31:32.920 --> 31:37.080
accepting applications right now uh so to give you a little idea of kind of what they're

31:37.080 --> 31:41.800
looking for they want something that would work off the quote unquote grid when disasters

31:41.800 --> 31:46.080
like earthquakes and hurricane strikes so keep this in mind mumble room communication

31:46.080 --> 31:49.860
networks they say are going to be critical infrastructure and they want vital messaging

31:49.860 --> 31:54.040
and mapping services to work after disaster uh the applicants will be expected to design

31:54.040 --> 31:59.280
both the means to access wireless network i.e the hardware and the applications provided

31:59.280 --> 32:05.120
on top of that network i.e software and project projects should be portable and easy to power

32:05.120 --> 32:12.000
and simple to access what do you think sweetly what would you start with i was thinking like

32:12.000 --> 32:18.200
some sort of mesh network and that like maybe okay you got to give me hardware and the software

32:18.200 --> 32:21.960
you'd use to do it because it's part of the challenge so what would it be like phone based

32:21.960 --> 32:25.480
would it be laptop based because you got to have something powerful enough to route the

32:25.480 --> 32:31.760
traffic if the network gets busy probably maybe something server based in that it would

32:31.760 --> 32:37.420
have to maybe go a little bit high end and that because you got to have something powerful

32:37.420 --> 32:45.200
enough to handle the load and that not having an unintended uh ddos right yeah exactly that's

32:45.200 --> 32:51.000
what i was like a tech man if you say a ham radio has already figured out some of this

32:51.000 --> 32:55.400
mr tech man go uh all right fine but i mean i think i mean that's a good that's a good

32:55.400 --> 32:59.400
point if i can speak for mr jimmy yeah um just that for some of these things if you

32:59.400 --> 33:02.480
don't need high bandwidth then that might be a legitimate thing because in emergency

33:02.480 --> 33:07.280
scenarios yeah you know you might just need like hey over here or we need food or whatever

33:07.280 --> 33:11.680
it high bandwidth you would you would definitely need high bandwidth all right bash basheru

33:11.680 --> 33:17.600
is what what is it bash flu ru bashful robot oh bad robot man i get for looking across

33:17.600 --> 33:23.320
the room uh distance versus cost hit me with it well because if you think about it you

33:23.320 --> 33:28.240
need to look at traditional carriers they they don't reach everywhere uh based on you

33:28.240 --> 33:33.760
know last mile fiber or even you know that's why they're jumping on like a lot of the satellite

33:33.760 --> 33:40.560
or the uh point-to-point wireless uh in canada here i mean you we have good transit across

33:40.560 --> 33:44.800
the nation but you get us into the last mile and we're we're hooped like you just can't

33:44.800 --> 33:50.840
get it and no one wants to pay for it uh there's like an s ton of dark fiber between vancouver

33:50.840 --> 33:55.840
and seattle that's been sitting there from when uh what was it 365 was in there and no

33:55.840 --> 34:01.560
one wants to buy it because it's too expensive yeah huh uh i guess that kind of is sort of

34:01.560 --> 34:06.400
maybe in line with your thinking producer michael satellites uh yeah there's a there's

34:06.400 --> 34:12.200
a project being done that allows anybody to contribute it uses open street maps and gps

34:12.200 --> 34:16.640
to share data through like without any kind of actual like data service so you just need

34:16.640 --> 34:22.520
to be able to access the gps so what's being done is anybody can go into the service sign

34:22.520 --> 34:27.160
up for the project and you can spend anywhere between five to 30 minutes and they have like

34:27.160 --> 34:32.360
these tasks that you can take data information that's been provided on the local level of

34:32.360 --> 34:38.240
of like reporters and stuff and you can go in and change and manipulate the map data

34:38.240 --> 34:44.720
so that people in emergency situations would get a notification really quick interesting

34:44.720 --> 34:49.520
that would be so okay that kind of gives me an idea so what about well i got i think i

34:49.520 --> 34:54.400
know how i would do it i think i i think i know how to do carry your pigeons maybe dude

34:54.400 --> 34:58.720
maybe hey let's talk about it do you have an idea like how you would do this like to

34:58.720 --> 35:01.920
me like at least i mean there's two kind of challenges here right there's the off the

35:01.920 --> 35:09.680
grid and the smart community networks one and to me like thinking about it it depends

35:09.680 --> 35:13.080
on what disasters are other things we're talking about here but it kind of seems like a software

35:13.080 --> 35:16.160
problem like we've already seen some chat apps or other things on mobile that will work

35:16.160 --> 35:21.240
without internet to do like nfc chat or wi-fi ad hoc chats so really to me it seems like

35:21.240 --> 35:26.960
the the problem is that we don't have a lot of um schemas or specs or things around how

35:26.960 --> 35:30.640
to share okay sure you have like a windows home group or something but realistically

35:30.640 --> 35:35.120
there's not a lot of great ways to interact so like you know like you lose your internet

35:35.120 --> 35:38.040
connection for the whole neighborhood but you need to share resources you're already

35:38.040 --> 35:41.160
connected if there's still power between your is if you're on the same is like we could

35:41.160 --> 35:45.720
have a lan but there's no there's no tools software or management would it be amazing

35:45.720 --> 35:51.800
if like this if you could have a so uh devices that mesh network even when there's no internet

35:51.800 --> 35:57.800
and say you had a wikipedia app and your phone had um the article's cache that i wanted i

35:57.800 --> 36:02.480
could retrieve them from your like if some if you had if the software was smart enough

36:02.480 --> 36:07.800
to not only announce what local data you had but if it was also smart enough to know that

36:07.800 --> 36:11.800
the privilege level this is public information that's important like i have no way to offer

36:11.800 --> 36:16.040
a service to my neighbors even though maybe we're all on the same isp the coax is connected

36:16.040 --> 36:19.880
there's a switch that connects us all there's just not standards like it's like a proxy

36:19.880 --> 36:24.320
server for everything in a over okay so here's where i was going with this is i think it's

36:24.320 --> 36:29.440
also a software problem because i don't think you would do just one particular fix like

36:29.440 --> 36:33.000
one of the things they mentioned in here is uh here's an example they said a backpack

36:33.000 --> 36:37.080
containing a hard drive computer battery and a wi-fi router the router provides access

36:37.080 --> 36:41.640
via wi-fi network to resources on the hard drive like maps and messaging applications

36:41.640 --> 36:45.320
like doing a data drop off or here's a drop off but now you need a way to know that data

36:45.320 --> 36:49.280
is there and you can access it so i think it is a software problem and then the other

36:49.280 --> 36:55.040
thing i was thinking is why why have one why only have one approach here why why only one

36:55.040 --> 37:01.880
thing why why just satellites why why just air balloons why not a like full spectrum

37:01.880 --> 37:06.500
in some areas it's a raspberry pi stuck in the corner somewhere at someone else's place

37:06.500 --> 37:11.580
they've got an x86 rig in their garage that's been sitting there providing a resharing networking

37:11.580 --> 37:15.620
now for a year somewhere else it's something built into a television because it's a high-end

37:15.620 --> 37:19.960
television and this is a common wireless chipset that's now been created at another place it's

37:19.960 --> 37:23.240
somebody's phone that's just helping fill in a bit of a gap and in another area it's

37:23.240 --> 37:27.400
a dgi drone that somebody strapped a raspberry pi to the bottom of but it's getting connection

37:27.400 --> 37:33.040
and sharing signal and if the network exists the software is smart enough to make the access

37:33.040 --> 37:37.560
happen if the connect however the connection is being provided if it's anything from a

37:37.560 --> 37:44.360
dgi drone to a x86 rig in a garage like whatever is sharing the connectivity that doesn't matter

37:44.360 --> 37:47.880
you make that irrelevant so that way that could be just hodgepodge because that's gonna

37:47.880 --> 37:52.040
be geographical to there's gonna be some areas that are that are poor that can only afford

37:52.040 --> 37:57.160
certain things that have hectic wiring and power and there's some areas and more connections

37:57.160 --> 38:02.120
will be a part of this yeah yeah exactly so you know it reminds me of our conversation

38:02.120 --> 38:06.920
with Michael Hall last week and endless OS and you combine what they're doing with offline

38:06.920 --> 38:12.660
things like recipes and Wikipedia and reference material and books and you combine it with

38:12.660 --> 38:20.080
something like this Mozilla challenge I wonder I just I'm fascinated by the whole idea especially

38:20.080 --> 38:23.980
when you use things like the lens of the net neutrality debate like say say we go to some

38:23.980 --> 38:28.160
dystopian future with net neutrality and corporate lockdown of the internet and the geeks had

38:28.160 --> 38:31.840
to save the world how would they do it what we say you had to rebuild the new network

38:31.840 --> 38:35.520
how would we do it we'd have to use the tools we have and it would be our phones our raspberry

38:35.520 --> 38:39.320
pies I mean like we're kicked off YouTube we can't live stream anymore and that's the

38:39.320 --> 38:45.020
only way you get videos I got selfies to post yeah right so join us over on the new internet

38:45.020 --> 38:48.560
where you just take your tin can and piece of string and you tie it to your neighbor's

38:48.560 --> 38:53.120
house and it's you know you watch JP it's cool but I think we could come up with something

38:53.120 --> 38:59.080
so here's what I'm saying go to the Mozilla blog read more about it win the two million

38:59.080 --> 39:04.000
dollars and then kick back a couple hundred bucks to JP for for hooking you speaking of

39:04.000 --> 39:08.320
Mozilla they launched a new podcast this week I wonder if they have it up on their website

39:08.320 --> 39:12.900
with their IRL podcast with Veronica Belmont you hear about this no yeah she's got a new

39:12.900 --> 39:17.800
show working for Mozilla see this is why you got to listen to the ask Noah show you got

39:17.800 --> 39:24.440
to listen because of Veronica Belmont joined Noah July our Noah July on ask Noah episode

39:24.440 --> 39:30.720
14 Belmont IRL look at that yeah and Noah talked to her about her projects the upcoming

39:30.720 --> 39:35.200
show the IRL podcast and all kinds of good stuff and they had a little Linux chat in

39:35.200 --> 39:39.920
there too Veronica Belmont is as a class act and so it was a good interview on super exciting

39:39.920 --> 39:45.120
yeah I think the new show launches today so how about that how about that I'll be curious

39:45.120 --> 39:48.400
to see where that goes because I've liked her on thing I mean I've been listening to

39:48.400 --> 39:52.120
Veronica Belmont since buzz out loud so I've liked her on all that stuff so I would I would

39:52.120 --> 39:55.800
imagine she'd probably put together a pretty decent show oh yeah episode 1 is now out on

39:55.800 --> 40:01.600
their IRL podcast dot org there you go oh you did listen to it yesterday Bash what'd

40:01.600 --> 40:09.320
you think it wasn't bad it had a very produced feel to it kind of almost scripted but they

40:09.320 --> 40:14.720
went heavy with the editing on it for sure yeah that's kind of a new thing you know shows

40:14.720 --> 40:19.560
where we sit around here and just don't don't edit out when people don't answer and hitting

40:19.560 --> 40:24.600
the microphone that's a that's a we are a dying breed we are legacy yeah we are legacy

40:24.600 --> 40:29.840
podcast we don't need season chapter markers and podcast apps and all these I mean it's

40:29.840 --> 40:34.720
just it's a straight brah mp3 feed sometimes we're an hour long sometimes we're an hour

40:34.720 --> 40:39.160
and a half it's a real train wreck it's a real train wreck it is a hashtag disastrous

40:39.160 --> 40:46.160
hashtag need data that's got to get that got to get that data well speaking of data West

40:46.160 --> 40:51.480
oh DigitalOcean's got data for days go over to DigitalOcean.com and sign up and use our

40:51.480 --> 40:56.240
promo code Linux Unplugged and get a $10 credit you heard Wes mention earlier they're introducing

40:56.240 --> 41:03.040
object storage they have they have block storage which is okay for me I'm gonna be honest when

41:03.040 --> 41:05.720
I when they introduced block storage I was good I was like this is all I need this is

41:05.720 --> 41:10.760
what I done but the beauty to object storage is then you can build your applications in

41:10.760 --> 41:14.800
a way that can scale for days and this is probably honestly if I was starting out today

41:14.800 --> 41:18.240
how I would do things as well so it's pretty brilliant that DigitalOcean is launching this

41:18.240 --> 41:21.560
and if you sign up for early access you can get a terabyte to play around with until like

41:21.560 --> 41:26.200
October what yeah that's nice so DigitalOcean is a really simple and straightforward way

41:26.200 --> 41:31.440
to spin up a nice rig on their infrastructure in seconds you they call them droplets I call

41:31.440 --> 41:36.040
them fast Linux rigs they got SSDs for all of the different types of machines they have

41:36.040 --> 41:43.000
lightning fast networking they have a beautiful UI to manage it and a simple API with tons

41:43.000 --> 41:46.800
of pre-built command line utilities that really that's really what matters about the API is

41:46.800 --> 41:49.760
the open source community has really embraced it something else that's really cool is they

41:49.760 --> 41:53.640
have load balancing as a service they have monitoring and alerting and they have hourly

41:53.640 --> 41:59.120
pricing available so you can get a 2 gig system with a two core processor 40 gigabyte SSD

41:59.120 --> 42:06.680
of disk and three pair three terabytes terabytes of transfer for three cents an hour DigitalOcean

42:06.680 --> 42:12.000
I tell you what go over there sign up use our promo code do unplugged get a $10 credit

42:12.000 --> 42:16.160
and mess around they got data centers all over the world and you can even run free I

42:16.160 --> 42:22.520
say fast Linux rigs but you can even run the good old free BSD what DigitalOcean.com use

42:22.520 --> 42:28.600
our promo code do unplugged and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the unplugged

42:28.600 --> 42:37.440
program so I I I am up for interruption at any point mumble as I go through the Dell

42:37.440 --> 42:41.560
machine I have here so please feel free if you have any questions to stop me and I'll

42:41.560 --> 42:47.240
answer them I had a I had a chance Dell I I guess I should probably back up so Dell

42:47.240 --> 42:51.320
sent me a couple of weeks ago I've been running this machine for a few weeks the Dell Precision

42:51.320 --> 42:58.440
5720 it's an all-in-one and this one came with Ubuntu 1604 and this was probably one

42:58.440 --> 43:02.520
of the hardest machines I've ever reviewed I feel like it's getting hard because how

43:02.520 --> 43:08.160
do you review a machine like this this is this is a it's a system it has Intel Xeon

43:08.160 --> 43:16.600
E3 1275 processor so it's quad core with hyper threading this one had 3.8 gigahertz clock

43:16.600 --> 43:21.800
which turbo boost up to 4.2 gigahertz with 8 megabyte cache you can put three drives

43:21.800 --> 43:29.160
this one had a PCIe m.2 drive and a I think I was spinning terabyte drive in it I mean

43:29.160 --> 43:33.800
it's just it's super fast and so you almost know immediately if you need a machine like

43:33.800 --> 43:37.800
this or not like I don't really need to tell you if you need a Xeon system with 64 gigs

43:37.800 --> 43:43.920
or up to 128 gigs but this one had 64 gigs of ECC RAM like you know that you know that

43:43.920 --> 43:47.000
you know immediately if that's too much system for you so then I was trying to figure out

43:47.000 --> 43:51.140
okay well so who are these people and what what are the workloads specific to the Linux

43:51.140 --> 43:55.880
desktop for a system kind of like this and I kind of broke it down into a few different

43:55.880 --> 44:02.000
areas definitely for a high-end photo management station and photo workflow like DigiCam this

44:02.000 --> 44:06.840
thing looks like it would be super fast disk I oh so if you have large megapixel photos

44:06.840 --> 44:12.800
from your DSLR high-resolution super vibrant screen tells been killing it with those screens

44:12.800 --> 44:18.080
lately I also did some video editing on it Linux itself is not super great at 4k playback

44:18.080 --> 44:23.800
right now but if you get hardware accelerated video decoding it works fine I did it and

44:23.800 --> 44:29.180
this machine is a great one for it but I think probably the other area that this thing would

44:29.180 --> 44:35.600
stomp would be software development I ran a series of open benchmark org benchmarks

44:35.600 --> 44:40.680
on this rig and what's really if you if you're curious about any of this stuff check out

44:40.680 --> 44:45.120
the pharaonic test suite it is really it's really a great piece of open source software

44:45.120 --> 44:51.680
we've talked about it before on the show but goodness goodness or as commie says lordy

44:51.680 --> 44:56.720
lordy lordy is this thing not great so first of all it simulates all kinds of workloads

44:56.720 --> 45:00.900
and installs the actual packages on your machine from your distros repository and then goes

45:00.900 --> 45:05.160
through and executes different workloads documents at all uploads it open benchmark allows you

45:05.160 --> 45:09.280
to compare it to other similar system allows people to compare their system to yours it

45:09.280 --> 45:14.800
is very very useful and so some of the benchmarks that I ran on it specifically to software

45:14.800 --> 45:19.300
development were some of the most impressive wow so one of the highlights is I was able

45:19.300 --> 45:24.560
to build Linux kernel 4.9 in under two minutes on the system now that would be a so there

45:24.560 --> 45:28.000
would be a way you could just a quick takeaway from this review if you're curious how fast

45:28.000 --> 45:32.920
the system is compared to yours go get kernel 4.9 source code on your system and build it

45:32.920 --> 45:37.400
and time that and that give you kind of a baseline in some sense of how fast just phenomenal

45:37.400 --> 45:41.880
how fast the system is this also means that if you're you have to use a custom kernel

45:41.880 --> 45:46.640
you can't complain about it well and I just try to mention I just I just it uses the stock

45:46.640 --> 45:50.420
kernel I just mentioned that as a benchmark because it if you can build it just gives

45:50.420 --> 45:53.560
you a perspective you're building your own projects how fast they might totally this

45:53.560 --> 45:57.240
comparison to the Linux kernel and I thought that was I thought that was just sort of an

45:57.240 --> 46:00.940
interesting perspective but I have a link in the show notes where you can actually run

46:00.940 --> 46:06.600
the comparison benchmark so you can click this link you give it the the address to the

46:06.600 --> 46:10.840
phronics test suite and it runs the exact benchmark I ran and it gives you the comparison

46:10.840 --> 46:16.760
result yes I have that in there so I spent I spent about a week using it to edit photos

46:16.760 --> 46:22.300
and video and I found it to be pretty exceptional at that and so I'd say that whole that whole

46:22.300 --> 46:27.160
sort of like high-end media production workload this thing's obviously great for anything

46:27.160 --> 46:30.520
that has a lot of disk I owe this thing's pretty great for and if you're if you're clever

46:30.520 --> 46:34.340
enough to monkey around with your system codecs or you're brave enough might be a better way

46:34.340 --> 46:39.880
to put it because it's really it's maybe it could be a stability issue I I really say

46:39.880 --> 46:42.720
you got to be you got to be willing to mess around with your codecs but you can get great

46:42.720 --> 46:46.320
4k video editing if you're just working with 1080 video this thing's gonna it's gonna slide

46:46.320 --> 46:51.400
yeah it's gonna slam it it I worked with this thing it even under heavy load it never felt

46:51.400 --> 46:55.440
really bogged down at all it was it does seem like it would appeal for the you know creatives

46:55.440 --> 46:58.160
or professionals who are just trying to get things done cuz you don't I mean like it's

46:58.160 --> 47:02.720
all it's an all-in-one type unit so you just put it on your desk you plug it in and then

47:02.720 --> 47:06.800
all right you got a computer now yeah let's talk about that is there really so if you're

47:06.800 --> 47:10.280
getting a system this powerful who wants a system that's this powerful that's also an

47:10.280 --> 47:12.800
all-in-one that was one of the other things I was trying to I was trying to figure that

47:12.800 --> 47:16.960
out because to me at first it wasn't obvious but having used it for a little bit I can

47:16.960 --> 47:21.400
tell you it's it's pretty low hassle and I think that's probably its biggest appeal if

47:21.400 --> 47:25.600
you use the Bluetooth mouse and keyboard it comes with you and you use Wi-Fi you have

47:25.600 --> 47:29.720
one cord coming out the back that's pretty nice and it's it's very clean it's very simple

47:29.720 --> 47:33.600
the speakers are incredibly we'll talk about more of those in a little bit it's it's that

47:33.600 --> 47:38.000
all is really nice where it gets kind of where it gets kind of interesting is if you combine

47:38.000 --> 47:43.080
it with the touchscreen option because the whole thing folds down right sort of like

47:43.080 --> 47:48.440
a surface studio but this is way more powerful than a surface studio and that is actually

47:48.440 --> 47:53.760
kind of a useful feature for certain types of work especially for certain types of video

47:53.760 --> 47:58.960
editing so I liked I could I started to use it more I was like I could kind of see this

47:58.960 --> 48:04.360
machine is powerful enough I feel like this machine spec'd as this was which is about

48:04.360 --> 48:11.120
$3,600 which is still like half the price of the iMac Pro would probably last you ten

48:11.120 --> 48:17.960
years you have USB-C up the wazoo on the back of this thing you have Thunderbolt 3 the back

48:17.960 --> 48:23.400
is removable the back is completely you you do two screws you do pull you remove two screws

48:23.400 --> 48:27.680
and the whole back of the thing comes off and you have access to all of the hard drives

48:27.680 --> 48:32.680
you have access to the memory I don't know about the CPUs I don't I believe they're there

48:32.680 --> 48:36.640
they are socketed but I don't know if you'd actually want to upgrade them and I don't

48:36.640 --> 48:41.780
know if that would void the warranty either but so it's it's much more sustainable than

48:41.780 --> 48:45.280
an iMac because it's nothing's really soldered you can get access to all of that stuff pretty

48:45.280 --> 48:49.480
quickly the screen is going to you mean where there's not going to be better screens really

48:49.480 --> 48:54.680
for there will be but it's gonna be a great screen for a long time yep it's it is fast

48:54.680 --> 49:02.600
enough with you know 64 gigabytes of ECC RAM 1.5 terabytes of super fast storage it the

49:02.600 --> 49:06.720
all-in-one aspect of it kind of makes more sense now than I think it used to because

49:06.720 --> 49:11.280
you're not really going to be super hard pressed to upgrade this thing that's where I thought

49:11.280 --> 49:14.720
about it as like from like the business or small business or design company or something

49:14.720 --> 49:17.680
like you could just buy that for an employee they're new you don't have to think about

49:17.680 --> 49:22.520
anything else the keyboard mouse done mm-hmm speakers exactly that when I put myself in

49:22.520 --> 49:25.640
the small business mindset and I thought oh yeah this could be a machine that you buy

49:25.640 --> 49:29.560
an employee don't have to have IT staff who can set it up and network and all of that

49:29.560 --> 49:34.160
yeah and you could you can buy the same one for your folks that run Ubuntu or Red Hat

49:34.160 --> 49:37.720
and you could buy the same one for your folks around Windows 10 yeah totally and so that's

49:37.720 --> 49:42.440
sort of an advantage that Dell has oh I don't know that was that's actually that's a good

49:42.440 --> 49:49.400
question I I'm not sure you know I I use Katie and live in my testing and I I find it to

49:49.400 --> 49:55.200
be usable if you use proxy media with high resolution stuff and I I put out a vlog that's

49:55.200 --> 49:58.400
more of a real quick look at this that's more visual heavy because this is a very pretty

49:58.400 --> 50:02.840
machine and I it is and I showed off some of my example work that I edited under this

50:02.840 --> 50:06.160
machine in the vlog I have it embedded in the show notes which is sort of a more of

50:06.160 --> 50:11.020
a quick take and my impressions of it and I thought that also be a good a good chance

50:11.020 --> 50:15.240
to show off some of the work you can do with the machine so that's sort of the that's sort

50:15.240 --> 50:19.840
of the my my oh I went through I had to go through several levels of realizations and

50:19.840 --> 50:23.680
the one was there is a workload for this even if it's not high resolution video editing

50:23.680 --> 50:27.760
there's still several really good workloads for this machine and software development

50:27.760 --> 50:33.400
being one that I think is probably high on that list and then then I had to kind of wrap

50:33.400 --> 50:37.200
my head around the hall all-in-one aspect of it like why would you want this as an all-in-one

50:37.200 --> 50:41.000
versus like like a little mini tower under your desk or something connected to like a

50:41.000 --> 50:45.080
5k screen I had to like I had to bridge that and it it wasn't until I sort of put myself

50:45.080 --> 50:48.320
in a small business like well this machine is fast enough I buy this for myself for an

50:48.320 --> 50:53.280
employee as a business this could easily be three four five six seven machine your machine

50:53.280 --> 50:58.220
and then it started to make a little more sense because it's also it's also just a very

50:58.220 --> 51:02.360
portable in a sense it's heavy but you can you can move between deaths it's not like

51:02.360 --> 51:06.320
it you don't have to move a whole bunch of a whole bunch of extra stuff it it's a I don't

51:06.320 --> 51:09.720
know it's it's kind of more appealing to me than it used to be and they they make it with

51:09.720 --> 51:14.000
this really heavy base that sits on the desk so that way you can move the screen around

51:14.000 --> 51:17.880
I was watching that and that's that seems nice like it doesn't it doesn't move around

51:17.880 --> 51:21.400
doesn't rock or tilt so it means it's a little awkward to carry but you're not moving around

51:21.400 --> 51:25.460
a lot right yeah so there so there's sort of the the first part of it I suppose the

51:25.460 --> 51:30.900
second part of it would be sort of the thermals and the noise stuff because I had an opportunity

51:30.900 --> 51:37.240
to punish them this machine and when it was very hot out it's very hot in the JB lab when

51:37.240 --> 51:43.160
I when I did this test so it was probably 90 degrees in the room only a small piece

51:43.160 --> 51:51.800
of the case melted it was it's fine yeah yeah what what Intel CPUs are running it's got

51:51.800 --> 51:55.240
you depending on what now this is of course you can you can get with a range but the one

51:55.240 --> 52:01.760
that I have is the Xeon E3 1275 so you have a huge range of CPUs yeah well they also essentially

52:01.760 --> 52:05.200
have something similar this in the XPS line which is I you can do which then you can even

52:05.200 --> 52:10.760
get with i7 or i5 so you have the XPS line of the all-in-one and then you have the precision

52:10.760 --> 52:15.800
line and this is the precision line which is the workstation grade enterprise grade

52:15.800 --> 52:19.980
line so that's why you have ECC and Xeons but it looks like the on the site they still

52:19.980 --> 52:25.480
offer the the yep i5s and i7s if you want if you don't need the Xeons so I and I think

52:25.480 --> 52:28.440
if you do that I think I might be wrong I think like starting price is like seventeen

52:28.440 --> 52:31.660
and eighteen hundred dollars yeah sixteen ninety nine yeah maybe I'm shopping for one

52:31.660 --> 52:35.920
right now as we're doing this so that is even more remarkable when you compare it to the

52:35.920 --> 52:40.640
iMac Pro it's obviously not competitive really but you have a starting range of seventeen

52:40.640 --> 52:44.920
hundred dollars and then you can configure upwards from there my favorite part here is

52:44.920 --> 52:49.080
you know all right well it shows like windows for me I can upgrade to Red Hat Enterprise

52:49.080 --> 52:55.080
for seventy more dollars that makes it look like a premium option well you get the Red

52:55.080 --> 53:00.920
Hat support so in a sense it is a premium option yeah yeah I I found it to be I found

53:00.920 --> 53:05.960
it to be fun because I I was like okay well how the hell am I gonna break this machine

53:05.960 --> 53:11.200
like what do you throw at a computer like this with that much RAM and and and and CPU

53:11.200 --> 53:15.120
so that's what I tried to do so over the weekend I really punished the hell out of this thing

53:15.120 --> 53:18.520
I put it in a 90 degree room not intentionally but that's how it worked out didn't have any

53:18.520 --> 53:23.560
other rooms and yeah well it was hot too it was a hot weekend Sunday especially oh yeah

53:23.560 --> 53:26.760
that was when I was really that was a hot day oh my god not really but we're from the

53:26.760 --> 53:32.880
Pacific Northwest so our conception of hot is not that it's like a hundred and it's moist

53:32.880 --> 53:37.200
AF I'll just say that I'll just say that it's moist AF but this thing also yeah so the so

53:37.200 --> 53:40.840
the back's removable where you can upgrade the components but then just IO wise you have

53:40.840 --> 53:46.480
display port out you have HDMI out you have Ethernet gigabit Ethernet I think it's got

53:46.480 --> 53:53.800
three USB C ports on the thing plus USB a plus SD card reader on the side so it's got

53:53.800 --> 53:58.540
tons of connectivity including connectivity for external graphics down the road this one

53:58.540 --> 54:05.720
came with the AMD workstation graphics eight gigs of video RAM he's yeah yeah so I was

54:05.720 --> 54:12.280
whoof it was it was even rendering all day yeah so I got another question architect was

54:12.280 --> 54:18.320
saying in chat that it has a base amount that where's that located because yeah I think

54:18.320 --> 54:23.240
I think this would be awesome if you had a base amount on the back of the screen so you

54:23.240 --> 54:27.560
have no base and it's like you could have a floating arm on your desktop and it's like

54:27.560 --> 54:31.680
you have no people will be going hey where's your computer and it's just the screen so

54:31.680 --> 54:35.640
I think you have two options actually I think so I think the stand comes off but that takes

54:35.640 --> 54:41.240
some trickery and I believe it on the bottom of the stand to the heavy part the plate there's

54:41.240 --> 54:45.640
a base amount capability too so you I think you have two options with the sucker to mount

54:45.640 --> 54:50.400
it which is pretty nice yeah because it would actually go really well on the wall I mean

54:50.400 --> 54:54.740
a killer killer system for something like that and like especially like a doctor's office

54:54.740 --> 54:59.180
where you wanted to be fast and reliable alright so let's talk about let's talk about thermals

54:59.180 --> 55:02.960
let's talk about the speakers and all that stuff but because we got to we got to prepare

55:02.960 --> 55:08.000
our we got to prepare ourselves let's take a moment and thank Linux Academy Linux Academy

slash unplugged sign up for a free seven-day trial thanks Linux Academy so looking at this

56:04.700 --> 56:11.160
thing I thought for sure that with Xeon processors and PCIe storage which often runs hot I thought

56:11.160 --> 56:16.120
for sure once I really started pushing it I would hear it make quite a bit of noise

56:16.120 --> 56:22.020
and I'd seen in I think it was swamp Swampy's review that he posted recently somebody else

56:22.020 --> 56:26.960
posted a review just the other day while I was finishing up mine and complained about

56:26.960 --> 56:31.160
some fan noise so I expected to hear quite a bit of fan noise and I think maybe depending

56:31.160 --> 56:34.060
on what you're pushing the machine you might get different results but when I was pushing

56:34.060 --> 56:42.040
the CPU super heavy and really working that doing things like builds and crypto benchmarks

56:42.040 --> 56:47.240
almost inaudible in a 90 degree room which really really surprised me when I started

56:47.240 --> 56:50.640
pushing the GPU more and more I could hear a different type of cooling kick and I don't

56:50.640 --> 56:53.360
know if it's just one fan in the system or if there's multiple fans I didn't take the

56:53.360 --> 56:58.000
back off to look to see how they're cooling it but I could definitely hear a bit more

56:58.000 --> 57:04.520
of an increase in odd in sound but I actually tried to record a little bit of the machine

57:04.520 --> 57:09.720
noise to give you a sample and the and the room the lab that I was in just the ambient

57:09.720 --> 57:13.800
noise of the room was louder than the machine noise even when I was pushing the GPU so it

57:13.800 --> 57:19.160
wasn't it wasn't too bad I think probably the thing that I'm the most mixed on and of

57:19.160 --> 57:22.440
course I don't think Dell's gonna like to hear this but the thing that I'm the most

57:22.440 --> 57:29.280
mixed on with this machine is the speakers they they some people have complained they

57:29.280 --> 57:32.540
don't look good I actually think in person they look fine they're not very noticeable

57:32.540 --> 57:36.560
I've so in like some photography of the machine I've I've I've lit it so that way you could

57:36.560 --> 57:40.900
see where the speakers were at and there's three speakers along the front three like

57:40.900 --> 57:45.600
a soundbar essentially and then in the base of the machine there's a sub so it's essentially

57:45.600 --> 57:52.440
a seven speaker system and to say Dell is proud of this would be an understatement while

57:52.440 --> 57:57.600
we were at Dell they made sure to demo it to us and told us about the Grammy award-winning

57:57.600 --> 58:03.440
tuning and then when they sent this machine to me they included a literature that went

58:03.440 --> 58:07.800
on for quite a bit about how advanced the sound system is in this and it's interesting

58:07.800 --> 58:12.400
to see how companies like there's aspects of their products are extremely proud of and

58:12.400 --> 58:17.160
the sound system was definitely one of them so I feel like anything negative I say about

58:17.160 --> 58:20.840
this is gonna be disappointing but I have to tell you the truth and the truth of it

58:20.840 --> 58:28.840
is for mids and they're great anything in mids like any music or a voice that's got

58:28.840 --> 58:32.360
a dialogue listen to some podcasts while I'm working on this no problem yeah or you know

58:32.360 --> 58:37.760
anything with guitar or cymbals or anything mids is gonna sound fantastic Spanish guitar

58:37.760 --> 58:41.480
podcast Chris obviously I feel like the highs began to distort a little bit at the high

58:41.480 --> 58:48.320
end just a little bit but here's why I say I feel like because what it really is is these

58:48.320 --> 58:56.920
speakers brutal brutally handle bad audio like they just are brutal with it like I guess

58:56.920 --> 59:00.540
here's a comparison I'm trying to make because I'm trying it's hard to like because we're

59:00.540 --> 59:03.160
coursework I can't like play a sample because we're re-encoding this audio so like it's

59:03.160 --> 59:07.660
really hard for me to to describe this problem to you but take out take take this sort of

59:07.660 --> 59:13.400
analogy if you will if you if you ever had a high-definition television that you got

59:13.400 --> 59:17.500
you brought it home you hooked it up and you plugged in your standard definition signal

59:17.500 --> 59:21.200
to it and all of a sudden standard definition television with look which looked just fine

59:21.200 --> 59:28.240
on your 22 inch CRT looks like total ass on you know that is how bad encoded audio sounds

59:28.240 --> 59:34.240
on these speakers to my ears to my ears YouTube videos like a 480p YouTube video or even

59:34.240 --> 59:40.720
a 720p YouTube video I can hear compression artifacts much more clearly with these speakers

59:40.720 --> 59:46.740
than I could hear them say on a standard set of very nice monitor desktop speakers and

59:46.740 --> 59:51.120
I think it's because these things accentuate highs and mids in a way that expose compression

59:51.120 --> 59:55.180
artifacts that if you if you know what to hear you will hear it constantly with these

59:55.180 --> 01:00:00.840
speakers because it turns out the internet is full of bad audio now if you have good

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:07.280
and I did a little AB comparison I took mp3 tracks and I took wave tracks and I played

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:13.320
them side to side and noticeably even with mp3s I could hear improved audio I perceptibly

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:17.120
could notice the audio sounded better with these speakers like they if you give them

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:21.340
more material to work with they do more and if you give them a compressed file there's

01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:25.020
just less for these speakers to work with and so they produce less and it's not that

01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:31.760
it doesn't sound good it's that once you hear these speakers sound great everything else

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:36.200
sounds like shit right and so then you want everything to be uncompressed or to be flack

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:41.260
and you don't want to watch any YouTube video under 1080p and Spotify has to go out the

01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:46.460
window and like it's really just it's an interesting problem to have and also then combine that

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:50.420
with the fact that the lows are pretty weak like there's not a lot of bass it's got a

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:54.860
built-in sub but I mean they're only so big right so how do you right now for most people

01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:58.980
they probably don't need a lot of boom in their in their desktop audio and if you're

01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:02.820
doing content editing or creation on this machine these speakers are great if you're

01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:06.780
doing podcast editing speakers are great if you're you know doing dialogue and stuff

01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:10.420
like that they're great you're playing games even if you don't want a lot of bass I think

01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:14.100
they're really great if you're watching a lot of YouTube if you're listening to a lot

01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:18.500
of compressed audio it sort of drove me crazy a little wow so that was my sort of like it

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:22.100
was this really weird torn issue on the speakers because yeah I acknowledge they're great and

01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:25.260
I can tell Dell's very proud of them. It's almost like a like studio monitor type thing

01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:29.060
you know it's like unless you've got a they won't compensate for your bad audio they don't

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:32.140
bass boost they don't do anything you know it's like you'll just hear if it's good it

01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:37.340
sounds great if not then hmm. So the way I looked at it's like well okay so when when

01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:41.060
I have that problem I could wear headphones which I might be more inclined to do anyways

01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:45.560
and then when I want built-in audio I have great audio available to me if my source is

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:49.020
good right but it is kind of awkward because like if you're an audio engineer then you're

01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:53.900
gonna have headphones or very nice speakers anyway so you probably won't use those. Yep

01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:58.380
yep yeah yeah that is interesting you're right about that it might make to me they almost

01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:03.140
make more sense in the XPS line which is more consumer focused and yes to answer the question

01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:06.980
it does have a headphone port so it's right there on the side too. If you look at the

01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:09.740
shot I have up on the video there's the SD card reader there and then right below it

01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:13.540
is the headphone. You're totally right though that like in person also I that bass is heavy

01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:16.580
I was just I was just playing with it and you're totally right like the fingerprints

01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:21.460
do show up but you're right like it's it's like a bezel on you know screens that don't

01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:24.540
have great bezel but you just you're looking at the screen you don't notice the speakers

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:28.540
at all they don't take away. They stand out more in the in when I lit the face so you

01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:33.880
can see the features but it has a very infinity pool feel to the front of it and that's one

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:37.780
of the things that's neat is because you combine it on this floating hinge and then it has

01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:43.460
the black infinity pool front so when the screen is off it just looks like this it's

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:49.420
just this infinite black hole sitting on your table and your soul sinks right in it's fine

01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:55.340
and then when you turn it on it's it's one of the best screens you'll see I think for

01:02:55.340 --> 01:03:03.020
a long time and so it goes from this deep black infinity pool to this vibrant 4k screen

01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:05.900
that almost goes all the way out here's a shot where I tried to demonstrate where you

01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:08.900
can see the edges almost goes all the way out to the edge of the screen Dell's getting

01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:14.400
really good with these things yeah they are and it just makes it totally pop and it everybody

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:18.700
that saw it commented on how how good it looks visually and so it's sort of hard to capture

01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:23.100
that and then you combine it with the great IO and the super fast performance then you

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:28.380
have Dell support that you get with it I honestly you were right about the production quality

01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:35.220
like the build quality of the thing yeah it's solid yeah it's I I I'm really impressed it's

01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:39.820
like when they decide to do it they really decide to do it it's it's so solid like I've

01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:44.980
carried this thing around now for weeks moving it between my place and the studio doing different

01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:50.280
tests on it on hikes clearly I did and I mean I'm telling you having moved this thing around

01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:54.700
it is even though that whole back panel comes off it is super solidly built which makes

01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:58.140
me really happy even like I feel like there are like we've talked about the caveats about

01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:01.500
like maybe this isn't for you you don't have a purpose it you being the audience member

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:05.800
or whatever but the fact that they can make something like this I'm excited to see this

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:14.180
trickle down or be this kind of approach in other product lines I honestly feel like if

01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:19.420
I'm being honest I'm enough of a gearhead that this would be a machine for me like I

01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:25.400
don't I guess I can't always justify Xeons and workstation graphics and ECC RAM but I

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:30.100
also I also know that I like my system to be extremely stable I also know that I want

01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:34.060
my business investments to last a long time I actually I don't think it's that big of

01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:37.880
a jump for somebody like me this would be a really I think this is a really great route

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:43.700
to go now and it because it doesn't start at $5,000 it now that Apple see Apple set

01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:48.140
the entry price for the iMac at $5,000 wow so the fact that this thing spec'd pretty

01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:53.820
nice as it is it's $3,600 well now it feels like a deal you know like thanks Apple you

01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:57.940
just sold Dell's machine for me because that one yeah it's it's very nice so I thought

01:04:57.940 --> 01:05:02.740
it was shockingly quiet very low fan noise even after multi-day benchmarks and the sound

01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:07.740
system for the most part is really great and if you have invested in a good audio like

01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:11.460
a good music collection you're gonna enjoy the shit out of these speakers I took this

01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:15.820
thing I took it out in the lab and took it out there because like I it was too loud to

01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:20.540
play in here it's too loud I have clips of me I tried to come up with a way to demonstrate

01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:24.740
how it sounds but how do you really if you don't have the speakers if you go you don't

01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:26.820
have the speakers to play it back you don't know what it sounds like you have to have

01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:33.940
better speakers or you know at minimum I'm the same I do have b-roll of of me playing

01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:37.900
music really loud on this thing and then trying to shout over it to demonstrate how loud it

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:42.260
is which I don't know if maybe the patrons want that I might wave file that you upload

01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:46.900
somewhere I have I have video of it let me try to shout over this machine like this will

01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:52.220
demonstrate it and then I got back to editing I'm like that is stupid as hell I'm not putting

01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:58.300
that in the show that's a dumb idea but they're pretty impressive so anyways it's it's a really

01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:04.220
nice rig it's also got a 1080p front-facing camera I think is that right yeah so I can

01:06:04.220 --> 01:06:09.540
video chat my grandkids and actually a decent multi-array mic too so it's not not too bad

01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:16.360
it's the precision 5720 if if you'd like to get your hands on one and also if I've peaked

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:20.660
your interest a little bit check out my review I posted it's a vlog 46 it's up at Jupiter

01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:25.660
broadcasting.com right now I call it in the vlog the Linux powered iMac pro killer it's

01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:30.380
very click baity but the reason the reason why I did it is I want to I just want to get

01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:34.700
the word out there like this is not a paid review Dell denied there was no exchange of

01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:40.400
goods for me to do this review I'm just extremely excited by the idea of a really well-built

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:46.220
all-in-one computer that really kicks ass performance wise and less than half the cost

01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:52.380
of the iMac Pro and you can buy it from them today Linux on it right now right now and

01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:57.800
the iMac Pro is not even available till December so I actually think it's like it just underscores

01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:02.660
how late to the game Apple is with the iMac Pro and so much of the market that they used

01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:07.260
to address with a device like this is being addressed by this machine really if you don't

01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:11.980
need Final Cut in motion yeah or Xcode and then we've talked a lot about how much like

01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:15.500
the developer story on Windows has gotten a lot better with the Linux subsystem and

01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:18.820
all of that like you could buy one of these I put Windows 10 on it and then run Linux

01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:23.100
subsystem and that's very enterprise friendly yeah I think it's a very competitive machine

01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:28.140
so I put I titled the vlog Linux powered iMac Pro killer not to be click baity so much as

01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:32.460
to just sort of set the conversation is hey there is already competition out here today

01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:37.360
and it runs Linux and I think that's a different that's a different state than things years

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:41.220
ago a machine like this that devastated something Apple released would have been would have

01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:44.740
been a Windows machine that would have been the big headline it's a Windows this Windows

01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:49.020
seven workstation just destroys the latest Apple machine right no now it's an Ubuntu

01:07:49.020 --> 01:07:53.500
machine and yeah I'll put the compare I'll put a couple of comparison benchmarks in the

01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:56.780
show notes if you want to compare it to your own machine just to kind of see what kind

01:07:56.780 --> 01:08:00.540
of Delta you'd have if you did an upgrade like this it's just early days I'm messing

01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:03.620
around this open benchmark stuff so if you like it leave me some feedback and give me

01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:09.820
suggestions of which benchmarks I should run it's not about coming up with stats and benchmark

01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:13.740
numbers that we can sit here and look at charts that's what for onyx is for what I really

01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:17.620
want to do with these is just give you some value so you can have comparisons to your

01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:21.820
own computer so you can actually walk away from a review like this and have an idea of

01:08:21.820 --> 01:08:25.060
what kind of difference it would make for your system if you were to upgrade so it's

01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:28.860
not really you know I'm not I'm not like some big some big benchmark guy all of a sudden

01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:32.100
I just think it's a great way for the audience to sort of have a comparison to their own

01:08:32.100 --> 01:08:35.700
thing you know it gives you something to make it more relevant you can yeah you know I would

01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:40.140
love to get I would love to get people's feedback on that on what kinds they use and what they'd

01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:44.260
like to see from us so yeah check it out if you were curious more go google the Dell Precision

01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:50.380
5720 with Ubuntu they have it on the developer site and check out the vlog too.

01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:54.380
Mr. West what else should we mention before we get out of here today because we you know

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:57.340
I mean we got some apparently people are already arriving at the studio for the barbecue.

01:08:57.340 --> 01:08:58.340
Did you hear that doorbell?

01:08:58.340 --> 01:08:59.340
They are early I think but that's fine.

01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:00.340
Barbecue's not till next week.

01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:05.340
Yeah come back or unless you have burgers now.

01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:10.660
Any other questions or thoughts about the Dell rig before we wrap up for the day?

01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:13.860
Do you think your kids would use it if you put it in front of them?

01:09:13.860 --> 01:09:15.380
Oh yeah for sure absolutely.

01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:16.380
If I put my back on it.

01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:17.380
It's almost too nice for the kids.

01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:21.060
Yeah I would go more for an XPS line it would make you know if I guess if you had the extra

01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:25.620
money it's but I if you're just buying a family machine I might consider the XPS line I don't

01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:31.700
know I for me I've always found precision lines to be very very reliable systems there's

01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:34.980
like that I've always been a fan of the business class systems and I'm willing to pay just

01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:38.820
a bit more for business class if you know it'll last you right yeah yeah yeah yeah

01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:40.220
I don't know it's a good question.

01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:42.700
All right Mr. West where should people find you throughout the week?

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:47.740
You can find me at Westpac or on the TechSnap program that's right hey just stay tuned we'll

01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:52.420
be live with that right now yeah yeah that's coming up next on the jblive.tv stream if

01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:56.240
you show up on a Tuesday you can hang out our mumble room hang out in our chat room

01:09:56.240 --> 01:10:01.620
and then stick around kick back and wind down with Dan and West on the TechSnap program

01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:05.220
go check out the latest episode of Ask Noah for his interview with Veronica Belmont check

01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:09.900
out the vlog for a quick video tour of the Dell system I just got done yammering on about

01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:15.420
nice and I hope I hope you'll be able to tune in or join us next week for the barbecue

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:20.260
wow that might be a fun show to make it live if you can I guess okay everybody thanks for

01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:48.900
joining us and we'll see you right back here next Tuesday for episode 204!

01:10:50.900 --> 01:11:18.900
Now it is our duty to title this thing JBtitles.com I'll be curious to see if anybody actually

01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:21.900
takes me up on that open benchmark thing because I brought it up in the vlog too and I haven't

01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:25.060
really gotten very much traction I think people don't actually want to take the time to do

01:11:25.060 --> 01:11:28.500
it unless they're really serious about making maybe we need to make it a little more competitive

01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:33.220
you know like hey guys think you can beat Chris's sweet open benchmark I was what I

01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:36.820
was now I'm thinking about that is like a server I can go run this on and shame you

01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:46.500
or that should be a challenge like here run open benchmark yeah yeah I thought about doing

01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:51.140
that in the vlog I just never really executed on it it didn't cross my mind really quick

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:56.220
that's what a lot of people do benchmarks for there's probably like a whole subset of

01:11:56.220 --> 01:12:03.380
the PC market or enthusiast PC market that runs 3d mark and other benchmark tools to

01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:09.780
do that and go okay this is like the best score with this crazy system how high can

01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:14.460
you get and things like that so we've got the Dell review and I think also the fact

01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:19.900
that mirror could save desktop Linux so whichever no just kidding I don't know it could go nowhere

01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:26.060
yeah that's true who knows who knows I'd like to find out more about that I know I thought

01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:30.620
the sway guy was working on something like that too yes I was trying to rack my mind

01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:34.100
for the word sway I could not remember during the show I need to try that maybe I'll switch

01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:36.980
since you're gonna switch away from now maybe I'll try sway for a while just see if I can

01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:44.260
get by with it and that'd be fun yeah let's do that I think it's wasted effort he's such

01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:52.140
a cynic don't listen to him mates Wayland miracle oh my god that is some fucking maneuver

01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:58.580
in every guy tell you what that Dell looks nice I got burn with the dub rod he says yeah

01:12:58.580 --> 01:13:03.460
yeah yeah yeah hybrid graphics with Radeon and guess what I can't use it because no 1604

01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:08.780
driver and hybrid graphics is rough man hybrid graphics it's rough yeah now that's probably

01:13:08.780 --> 01:13:12.260
not gonna happen with their new developer line of machines I would bet you know you'd

01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:18.060
hope not yeah that you know the we have the original Sputnik in production we have an

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:42.980
XPS from like two models ago and they've all been pretty solid
