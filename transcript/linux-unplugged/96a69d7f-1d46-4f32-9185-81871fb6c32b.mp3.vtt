00:00.000 --> 00:04.400
Microsoft's done it again. They've open sourced another project.

00:04.400 --> 00:05.600
Oh, is it big this time?

00:05.600 --> 00:07.000
I think so.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
Okay, let's see if we can figure it out. Don't tell us what it is.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
I got one hint for you.

00:11.000 --> 00:11.600
Okay.

00:11.600 --> 00:18.200
Part of the reason Microsoft says it's open sourcing X is the changing state of work.

00:18.200 --> 00:21.900
Oh, it's probably something to do with Teams then. That sounds very Teamsy.

00:21.900 --> 00:23.500
There may be a Teams connection.

00:23.500 --> 00:27.900
Hmm, have they open sourced something in with Skype that wasn't open sourced before?

00:27.900 --> 00:30.400
That's my guess. You boys have a guess? You got anything?

00:30.400 --> 00:35.200
I think it's an open cookbook. It sounds like maybe that's the state of work that's changing.

00:35.200 --> 00:39.500
I'm going to go with open sourcing the Windows kernel.

00:39.500 --> 00:41.200
Whoa, that's bold.

00:41.200 --> 00:44.500
That would really change the face of work. That would really change the industry.

00:44.500 --> 00:45.800
That would be history right now.

00:45.800 --> 00:46.300
I wish.

00:46.300 --> 00:47.600
All right, so what is it?

00:47.600 --> 00:51.600
It had a 1500 3D emoji sound.

00:51.600 --> 01:05.700
Emojis?

01:05.700 --> 01:10.000
Hello friends and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

01:10.000 --> 01:10.700
My name is Chris.

01:10.700 --> 01:11.700
My name is Wes.

01:11.700 --> 01:12.900
My name is Brent.

01:12.900 --> 01:14.300
My name is Alex.

01:14.300 --> 01:17.300
Hello you handsome devils coming up on the show this week.

01:17.300 --> 01:20.100
Well, we blew it.

01:20.100 --> 01:21.100
We knew it was going to happen.

01:21.100 --> 01:23.300
We warned you this was going to happen.

01:23.300 --> 01:26.100
This is your chance to say I told you so.

01:26.100 --> 01:31.300
Our little server, our humble garage box has died again.

01:31.300 --> 01:35.300
Join us this week as we attempt to save our little zombie server.

01:35.300 --> 01:39.600
Bring it back from the death and this time we may be looking at data loss.

01:39.600 --> 01:44.100
So we'll lay out what we're going to do in the future and our plans going forward.

01:44.100 --> 01:48.900
Then we'll round out the show with some great JB news, some boosts and picks and more.

01:48.900 --> 01:51.700
So before we go any further, let's bring in our virtual lug.

01:51.700 --> 01:53.100
Time appropriate greetings.

01:53.100 --> 01:53.700
Mumble room.

01:53.700 --> 01:54.600
Hello friends.

01:54.600 --> 01:55.100
Hello.

01:55.100 --> 01:55.600
Hello.

01:55.600 --> 01:56.100
Hello guys.

01:56.100 --> 01:57.000
Hello Wes.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.300
Hello Alex and Brent.

01:59.300 --> 02:00.600
Hello.

02:00.600 --> 02:01.500
Hello on air.

02:01.500 --> 02:02.500
Hello quiet listening.

02:02.500 --> 02:04.600
We offer both to our mumble room.

02:04.600 --> 02:08.600
If you'd like to just join and get a low latency open stream, you absolutely can.

02:08.600 --> 02:13.800
And of course, you're always welcome to get in that on listening and share your thoughts with us as we go live.

02:13.800 --> 02:17.100
The only thing we do is we just kind of like check to make sure you got a mic that works for us.

02:17.100 --> 02:22.100
And as long as it passes the sniff test, which is actually a listen test, we'll put you on air

02:22.100 --> 02:23.100
and you can get in that virtual lug.

02:23.100 --> 02:25.400
And of course, you can always jump in.

02:25.400 --> 02:28.200
Just tag me in the chat room and I'll try to work into the conversation.

02:28.200 --> 02:32.800
Sometime, you know, eventually mumble get those smells via wire, but we're not there yet.

02:32.800 --> 02:35.900
I have been using the heck out of tail scale this weekend.

02:35.900 --> 02:39.300
So go over to tailscale.com and say good morning from Linux Unplugged.

02:39.300 --> 02:39.900
Would you?

02:39.900 --> 02:42.800
Tail scale is a mesh VPN protected by WireGuard.

02:42.800 --> 02:44.600
Get it on any device in seconds.

02:44.600 --> 02:48.800
And I mean it. Mobile, armed device, x86 box, VM, VPS.

02:48.800 --> 02:51.300
Do it. Build yourself a mesh network with WireGuard.

02:51.300 --> 02:51.800
We love it.

02:51.800 --> 02:53.300
It'll change your game.

02:53.300 --> 02:54.100
Go say good morning.

02:54.100 --> 02:57.500
Try it out for 20 devices for free at tailscale.com.

02:57.500 --> 03:00.400
Yeah, I wish you'd stop making me time you setting up tail scale.

03:00.400 --> 03:01.900
It's getting old. You're fast.

03:01.900 --> 03:03.000
I get it. It's fun.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.500
It's fun. All right.

03:04.500 --> 03:09.700
So let me take you all back in time a little bit.

03:09.700 --> 03:15.800
Years ago, we identified that sometimes there are just certain jobs that work better locally.

03:15.800 --> 03:18.400
Perhaps it's an old archive of your past productions.

03:18.400 --> 03:20.200
You want to save the raw files.

03:20.200 --> 03:23.400
Maybe it's movies you've backed up via the DVD or the blu-ray.

03:23.400 --> 03:26.000
Love you. Make MKV.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.100
Or maybe it's just something that's really not something your team needs access to very often.

03:31.100 --> 03:33.900
So it just doesn't make sense to store it in the cloud.

03:33.900 --> 03:37.600
My friends enter in our legacy server hardware,

03:37.600 --> 03:44.000
which we have been running out of the garage here at the studio since about 2014 ish.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.100
We bought the box used at the time and it's been serving a lot of great little duties for us.

03:50.100 --> 03:51.200
Then within the last year,

03:51.200 --> 03:58.400
we had a couple of very generous audience members donate us brand new used server hardware new to us.

03:58.400 --> 04:02.300
And we jumped into action.

04:02.300 --> 04:06.100
And moved some of the services over.

04:06.100 --> 04:08.800
It's been a process an ongoing process you might say.

04:08.800 --> 04:13.000
Yeah, and we've gone through several summers where this box gets really hot

04:13.000 --> 04:18.600
and we've tried to come up with various solutions because it is a garage that the afternoon sun hits

04:18.600 --> 04:21.500
and every now and then I pull in there with my hot car too.

04:21.500 --> 04:26.200
And so sometimes the ambient temperature can be 95 degrees.

04:26.200 --> 04:31.000
So we've come up with various strategies over the years to try to accommodate for this high temperature

04:31.000 --> 04:32.800
less than ideal production environment.

04:32.800 --> 04:36.200
We get the palm leaves. We take turns in there. It's rough.

04:36.200 --> 04:41.000
So I've set up this year. What I did was like a whole air cooling system.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.100
I created a holistic approach to my temperature management Wes.

04:46.100 --> 04:48.500
I cracked the garage door.

04:48.500 --> 04:49.400
Okay. All right.

04:49.400 --> 04:52.000
And then I set a box fan in the doorway.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.200
Oh, we've got some we've got you know outside airflow.

04:56.200 --> 04:57.400
These are good ingredients.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.100
Then further down the hallway.

04:59.100 --> 05:07.300
I set up a second box fan and then for like the real like cooling like finality piece.

05:07.300 --> 05:08.800
I opened the back door.

05:08.800 --> 05:11.900
So I create a cross breeze through the entire house.

05:11.900 --> 05:15.500
It creates a wind tunnel that sucks the hot air out of the garage

05:15.500 --> 05:19.900
and vents it out the back of the studio and it actually does work to a degree

05:19.900 --> 05:34.500
and it's ridiculous because a cat came in and pissed in the garage traditional hazards that are most servers encounter.

05:34.500 --> 05:40.500
No and and this will come into play later.

05:40.500 --> 05:42.500
Also, there was a lot of you know,

05:42.500 --> 05:46.500
when cotton trees bloom and there's like this cotton that goes in the air in the Pacific.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.500
It's like it's snowing for a day.

05:48.500 --> 05:56.300
Well, a lot of that came into the wind tunnel.

05:56.300 --> 06:07.000
The entire garage got covered in cotton flowers rolling around in the cat piss getting in the server stuck in the cat piss has really happened.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.400
So it's coming in.

06:10.400 --> 06:13.200
I'm picturing this cartoon with you know,

06:13.200 --> 06:16.400
the chicken that falls into tar or something and then people throw feathers at it.

06:16.400 --> 06:22.300
Yeah, then Levi got in there fast forward to last week Thursday.

06:22.300 --> 06:29.100
I realize it's getting hot again and even that particularly hot just kind of back to hot hot enough that the garage is getting warm.

06:29.100 --> 06:34.900
And so my protocol is around one two o'clock right about now actually as we record I would shut the server down

06:34.900 --> 06:41.400
because the temperatures are just getting too high and we don't have a better solution than that with what I've done.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.400
And I would shut it down and then we wouldn't use it for a bit.

06:43.400 --> 06:49.000
So I migrated a couple of of more essential services off each individual server up on the Linode

06:49.000 --> 06:51.200
and I kind of kind of spread things out.

06:51.200 --> 06:54.800
So like certain batch jobs are happening on one server like the the plaques

06:54.800 --> 06:58.600
and the jellyfin media has happened on one server like I've kind of spread the load out a little bit.

06:58.600 --> 07:04.500
So if one box dies not everything goes and then I would shut them down in like right about now.

07:04.500 --> 07:06.700
And then the next day in the morning I get in about 7 a.m.

07:06.700 --> 07:08.900
And I turn them on and run them till about 1 p.m.

07:08.900 --> 07:13.200
You know, let them get caught up on their work and whatnot do their backups.

07:13.200 --> 07:21.200
And so Thursday evening it was a busy day and I didn't make it out there till like 4 o'clock.

07:21.200 --> 07:26.100
And I get out there and it's 92 degrees in the garage and all the servers are going.

07:26.100 --> 07:30.500
So I go to each one I shut them all down and I go to our oldest server.

07:30.500 --> 07:35.700
The one that has like our historic projects on it the ones that go back from the very beginning of time

07:35.700 --> 07:41.800
and the one that has all of my media library, which Chris's private selection 70 80 percent.

07:41.800 --> 07:48.600
I've hand ripped right like pride has gone into creating these rips funny enough.

07:48.600 --> 07:51.900
Almost like a weird like movie foreshadow the day before.

07:51.900 --> 07:56.100
I'm not even kidding you had he was like, should we just throw away all this physical media?

07:56.100 --> 07:58.800
Because I've got like crates of it under the server of physical media.

07:58.800 --> 08:01.700
And she's like we don't watch DVDs or blu-rays.

08:01.700 --> 08:03.700
Should I just like sell this or get rid of it?

08:03.700 --> 08:06.300
Like what do you want me? I'm like, I don't know.

08:06.300 --> 08:09.300
Let's hold on to it for a little bit longer. I like having the source copies.

08:09.300 --> 08:11.000
Let's hold on to it for a little bit longer.

08:11.000 --> 08:16.300
That was the previous day. The next day I go out there.

08:16.300 --> 08:20.100
I go to do a halt, you know, like a pseudo shutdown kind of thing.

08:20.100 --> 08:23.700
And it tells me the binary cannot be executed.

08:23.700 --> 08:28.100
That's a good sign. Just always a great sign that your systems working normally.

08:28.100 --> 08:32.900
So then I have my laptop. So I fired my laptop. I go to SSH in SSH connection refused.

08:32.900 --> 08:36.100
Like well the box is up. I'm standing right here.

08:36.100 --> 08:39.700
So I do the control delete, you know, the six times and it starts to reboot

08:39.700 --> 08:42.900
and I get cannot unmount and it's this ZFS path.

08:42.900 --> 08:45.800
Cannot unmount this ZFS path. Cannot unmount this ZFS.

08:45.800 --> 08:50.900
And it's all screen after screen. ZFS error, ZFS error, ZFS error, ZFS error.

08:50.900 --> 08:54.500
And then cannot execute shutdown.

08:54.500 --> 08:58.900
So I shut it off and it's too hot and I'm like, I'm not going to stand out here

08:58.900 --> 09:01.300
in 90 plus degree weather and troubleshoot this thing

09:01.300 --> 09:04.200
and I'm not going to run it in 90 plus degree weather.

09:04.200 --> 09:05.700
So I shut it down Thursday night.

09:05.700 --> 09:08.800
I got in my car and I left and I went home and I was like in a bad place.

09:08.800 --> 09:13.600
I was like, ah, just mostly because even if I could re-rip all of that stuff

09:13.600 --> 09:18.200
and even if I could reset up the server, like how many days of work am I looking at?

09:18.200 --> 09:21.700
Right? Just that, right? I was sitting with like, oh my God.

09:21.700 --> 09:25.900
This is going to be weeks of work, right?

09:25.900 --> 09:28.100
And I, so I get over it. I get home and I think well,

09:28.100 --> 09:32.000
I'll go down there tomorrow, Friday and boot it up.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Get like, get it going off a USB disk.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
Get the lay of the land at least. Yeah.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.400
So that was sort of my mindset. I was like, maybe it'll be all right.

09:40.400 --> 09:42.800
I'll get in there. See if the DFS array is fine.

09:42.800 --> 09:46.700
Maybe it's just the boot disk that failed because that is its own separate disk

09:46.700 --> 09:52.000
that is super jank outside the case. Not properly cooled.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.600
Oh, this keeps getting better. It was like not a great setup.

09:55.600 --> 09:57.700
So I figured if there was going to be a point of failure,

09:57.700 --> 10:00.400
that's where it was going to fail. So Friday morning,

10:00.400 --> 10:03.400
I come out really kind of early like 7 a.m.

10:03.400 --> 10:08.000
because I had an 8 a.m. call and then I had a 9 a.m. recording and like,

10:08.000 --> 10:09.800
I knew like I had, did not have much time to look at this,

10:09.800 --> 10:14.100
but I thought I'll get out there while it's still like 65 degrees in the garage

10:14.100 --> 10:16.500
and get this thing booted. It's the next morning.

10:16.500 --> 10:19.400
I've been standing here for a little bit. It's still pretty early.

10:19.400 --> 10:23.700
I want to do this while it's cold out, but I've been just trying to strategize

10:23.700 --> 10:26.900
and honestly kind of reflect on what I'm going to do if this thing doesn't work.

10:26.900 --> 10:29.300
Like after I press this power button,

10:29.300 --> 10:34.200
I'm either going to have a massive pain in my butt or everything's going to be fine

10:34.200 --> 10:35.800
with some logs I need to review.

10:35.800 --> 10:38.100
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to turn it on

10:38.100 --> 10:43.400
and then I'm just going to listen. I suspect maybe the OS drive has died.

10:43.400 --> 10:47.000
But we'll see. Here we go.

10:47.000 --> 11:01.800
All right, everything's coming on. Monitor's powering up.

11:01.800 --> 11:08.800
Drives have lit up. No red lights yet.

11:08.800 --> 11:12.900
I'll be closely watching both the post-boot screen

11:12.900 --> 11:17.300
and also of course once the OS starts to load.

11:17.300 --> 11:21.800
Just kind of in that window right now.

11:21.800 --> 11:24.800
I just have to wait. The screen hasn't turned up.

11:24.800 --> 11:29.200
I just have to wait. Come on screen. Show me your post.

11:29.200 --> 11:36.500
Show me your post. Ah, here we go.

11:36.500 --> 11:43.600
Okay, no BIOS errors or IPMI module error or USB controller error.

11:43.600 --> 11:45.700
The disks are all pass through so there's no con-

11:45.700 --> 11:48.400
I wouldn't expect any kind of controller error, but we'll see.

11:48.400 --> 11:57.700
Oh, there we go. Oh, that moment.

11:57.700 --> 12:04.100
Okay, we're getting to grub now. Oh, no.

12:04.100 --> 12:08.000
Reboot and select a proper boot device or install boot media

12:08.000 --> 12:11.600
in the selected boot device and press a key.

12:11.600 --> 12:16.600
I think our OS drive is indeed dead.

12:16.600 --> 12:19.800
I'm touching which I think this is the OS drive.

12:19.800 --> 12:26.200
It's hard to tell, but I don't think it's spinning.

12:26.200 --> 12:31.400
Better than the array, but man, what a pain in the butt.

12:31.400 --> 12:34.700
So at this point, I'm pretty sure the data is probably good.

12:34.700 --> 12:38.100
And what I'm thinking is I'll go grab Ventoy.

12:38.100 --> 12:41.500
I'll boot Ubuntu 2204 because it's got built-in ZFS support.

12:41.500 --> 12:45.100
Sure. I'll get SSH going on this thing

12:45.100 --> 12:46.300
and then we'll get it restored, right?

12:46.300 --> 12:48.300
It's like not ideal,

12:48.300 --> 12:51.000
but this seems like something we could actually recover from.

12:51.000 --> 12:56.700
And of course, I ran out of time and I had to go record

12:56.700 --> 12:59.500
and do a call, which I was totally down for doing

12:59.500 --> 13:03.300
because we're working on some great swag for the West Coast road trip.

13:03.300 --> 13:05.700
So I was like, I had to go to take care of that.

13:05.700 --> 13:08.800
Totes worth it, but the job demands I move on.

13:08.800 --> 13:11.300
I'm not a server admin by my day trading anymore.

13:11.300 --> 13:13.300
Just a nice little hobby you have sometimes.

13:13.300 --> 13:17.000
So in the back of my mind, I'm strategizing

13:17.000 --> 13:18.700
without really realizing I'm doing it.

13:18.700 --> 13:20.400
I'm thinking, all right, I'm going to get that Ventoy.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.800
I'm going to do this. I'm going to do that.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.200
So I sneak out there in the middle of the day

13:24.200 --> 13:26.300
and I pop the Ventoy in the back because for whatever reason,

13:26.300 --> 13:29.400
the Super Micro, it doesn't have any USB ports in the front

13:29.400 --> 13:31.600
and man, is that annoying. Like, come on.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.700
So I'm doing this thing where I'm trying to get it way back in there.

13:35.700 --> 13:37.200
But of course, I have the MVME

13:37.200 --> 13:40.800
and this big housing that has CNA on both ends of the connector for USB.

13:40.800 --> 13:44.500
So it's like, it's this big fat mother and I'm trying to get it in there.

13:44.500 --> 13:46.200
But it's only got two USB.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.100
Anyways, it was super annoying.

13:47.100 --> 13:49.300
You really need to be looking at it and rotate the whole thing.

13:49.300 --> 13:51.200
But I get the Ventoy attached.

13:51.200 --> 13:55.900
I reboot it and I get this strange, strange boot error.

13:55.900 --> 14:00.200
Like it's totally, obviously the Ventoy is completely incompatible.

14:00.200 --> 14:01.400
This is like three releases ago.

14:01.400 --> 14:04.900
Ventoy, it's obviously totally incompatible with the Super Micro BIOS.

14:04.900 --> 14:08.900
Well, OK, so I got to go flash this event to image directly to a USB thumb drive.

14:08.900 --> 14:10.300
Sure. OK, fine. Fine.

14:10.300 --> 14:12.200
Well, I don't got time for that right now.

14:12.200 --> 14:15.500
So I was like, OK, well, there goes my 15 minutes to try to solve this.

14:15.500 --> 14:19.100
So I move on and I keep I keep working to finish off my Friday.

14:19.100 --> 14:22.500
Record a Bitcoin dad pod and I go home because I got the kids.

14:22.500 --> 14:25.400
Kids are over. We got stuff going on. It's weekend time.

14:25.400 --> 14:27.300
Saturday, same thing. It's too hot.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.800
I can't really go down there and work on it.

14:28.800 --> 14:32.800
Saturday, take the kids out for a hike, which was also brutal.

14:32.800 --> 14:34.900
And then get home. It's like the evening.

14:34.900 --> 14:40.100
I think I could go down to the studio and get it going now because I want to make it ready for us to get it up right now and get it repaired.

14:40.100 --> 14:42.000
My thought is I could do the whole USB boot thing.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.400
I got the ISO image. I've got a USB thumb drive.

14:45.400 --> 14:48.300
Good to go. Screw it.

14:48.300 --> 14:52.300
I'll come in Sunday morning. So I get in early this morning before the show.

14:52.300 --> 14:55.400
While the server room is still nice and cool.

14:55.400 --> 15:02.100
And I'm looking at the other servers that are off the other new servers that have been contributed by audience members.

15:02.100 --> 15:09.600
And I just thought while they're off, maybe I should just do a health check on these things, too, before these things end up dying on me.

15:09.600 --> 15:16.600
I open it up. And it is covered in cottonwood.

15:16.600 --> 15:20.100
I open up the other server covered in cottonwood.

15:20.100 --> 15:24.800
I pull out the drive trays, all of the air intakes totally covered.

15:24.800 --> 15:30.300
So I kid you not, I spent an hour and 45 minutes this morning cleaning servers with cotton vacuuming.

15:30.300 --> 15:35.600
I'm pulling out every single disk, vacuuming them, putting them back in because everything's down.

15:35.600 --> 15:39.300
So might as well do it now. Right. Hey, I have a top tip for that.

15:39.300 --> 15:47.400
If you have a loose blower or some compressed air, that's the best way because you don't need to touch things that way rather than vacuum.

15:47.400 --> 15:51.200
Well, you know, the whole thing was all I had out there was a shop vac. I wasn't expecting this. Right.

15:51.200 --> 15:57.600
But then I thought I should check this. Yeah. So then I think, well, I should probably go look how old fake NAS is doing.

15:57.600 --> 16:03.600
Right. How's old fake NAS doing? And I go and I didn't expect any of this.

16:03.600 --> 16:11.000
And I didn't I didn't even get the USB disk inserted before I started discovering something was a little strange.

16:11.000 --> 16:20.900
This is a pretty old box. And one of the things I just want to double check before I write this hard drive off completely is that the power is good.

16:20.900 --> 16:26.000
And the data is good because the power is actually I just noticed coming off a little splitter here.

16:26.000 --> 16:32.000
So I'm going to rid of this splitter and then run it directly to the hard drive.

16:32.000 --> 16:36.600
Now, the hard drive itself is a Western Digital. It's one of those velociraptor drives.

16:36.600 --> 16:41.100
So it's like 10000 RPM. Honestly, I would actually expect this thing to die. Right.

16:41.100 --> 16:46.900
The other ones are all 7200. But this thing not only was it not getting the proper cooling because the case was cracked,

16:46.900 --> 16:51.500
but it's also a 10000 RPM disk. But we'll see running.

16:51.500 --> 17:01.000
I'm running different power and I'm running slightly better spot here in terms of hopefully it would get better cooling.

17:01.000 --> 17:08.200
I doubt it. I'm actually just more kind of banking on the power situation. That adapter looked a little sketch.

17:08.200 --> 17:16.400
I'm sure that had nothing to do with it. OK, here we go. It's actually a decent box.

17:16.400 --> 17:24.300
It has two L5640 Xeon CPUs in it at 2.27 gigahertz each.

17:24.300 --> 17:29.200
And I don't know something like 48 gigs of RAM, 64 gigs of RAM, quite a bit of RAM.

17:29.200 --> 17:34.700
So, you know, it's lasted quite a long time for us. It's it's definitely served its purpose, I should say.

17:34.700 --> 17:39.700
I could just use a couple of more months. Come on, come on, keep going.

17:39.700 --> 17:48.900
Show me grub. Show me that grub. Boot baby, boot. No, come on, come on.

17:48.900 --> 17:57.300
It's booting. System D version 249.5-3-arch. Yes, this box is still running arch.

17:57.300 --> 18:04.900
I can't believe it. That is going to be the luckiest play ever because I had a ton of errors when I shut this thing down.

18:04.900 --> 18:12.200
So maybe that thing just got hot. I don't know. Maybe that adapter got hot. It's booting right now.

18:12.200 --> 18:22.000
Drives are flashing. OK, I got a snapshot failure here, but that's not a big deal. Come on.

18:22.000 --> 18:32.000
I can hear the hard drive clicking. Come on, please boot. I do not need this project right now.

18:32.000 --> 18:40.100
Uh-oh. Oh, no, there we go. OK, so one network interface didn't start, but that's not even the primary network interface.

18:40.100 --> 18:45.400
We're up. We're up. I'm going to go check services, but the disks are flashing away.

18:45.400 --> 18:54.500
They look so happy. They look like a date of Christmas tree.

18:54.500 --> 19:00.000
I don't remember why we did it, but when we hooked up that extra OS boot drive we added last minute,

19:00.000 --> 19:03.800
we hooked it up to a splitter and I think that splitter was just done. It was dead.

19:03.800 --> 19:12.500
Now, obviously, clearly, this is like the third time we have pulled the server back from the absolute brink of death.

19:12.500 --> 19:18.800
And this time I really got a lesson learned. I never want this to happen again.

19:18.800 --> 19:27.100
So we'll get to that here in a second. But what I was thinking, Wes, is what we ought to do is log into that thing and let's get it up to date.

19:27.100 --> 19:30.400
We better get it up to date. While, you know, while we can while we're working on it,

19:30.400 --> 19:32.600
because I don't think it's been since we've done it on the show.

19:32.600 --> 19:37.700
And, you know, these arch boxes, they tend to break when you go months without updating them.

19:37.700 --> 19:42.100
So why don't we do it now live on the show?

19:42.100 --> 19:46.500
If you wouldn't mind SSHing into there. I checked earlier.

19:46.500 --> 19:56.100
I believe we have about a gigabyte worth of packages to download with a net upgrade size of 152 megabytes.

19:56.100 --> 20:01.300
It's essentially every system package. Every app, every package on there.

20:01.300 --> 20:02.800
You love updates.

20:02.800 --> 20:04.400
So let's do it. Let's get it all up to date.

20:04.400 --> 20:10.800
Let's get this thing done and make sure it's in a good spot for the rest of the road trip.

20:10.800 --> 20:13.700
And then I'll tell you what I'm thinking about.

20:13.700 --> 20:18.400
You're going to make me help you rip these Blu-rays if this doesn't work, aren't you?

20:18.400 --> 20:22.000
We'll come back to that. We'll see how you do, Wes. You let us know, OK?

20:22.000 --> 20:24.300
Oh, net upgrade size 150 megabytes.

20:24.300 --> 20:27.700
Yeah, isn't that great? Just what a thing. It is pretty great.

20:27.700 --> 20:34.000
I've realized we should colo these. These these probably shouldn't be in my garage anymore.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.200
It's been fun and I've got away with it for years.

20:37.200 --> 20:46.100
But when the cottonwood came in and it made me realize that this is just not a this is not a doable thing anymore.

20:46.100 --> 20:52.200
And so if anyone out there in the audience in the Pacific Northwest area happens to work at a data center

20:52.200 --> 20:55.700
or a colo location where we could take two or three boxes

20:55.700 --> 20:59.000
and put them in a rack where they could be properly taken care of,

20:59.000 --> 21:04.000
please reach out Chris at Jupiterbroadcasting.com or Linuxonplug.com contact.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
We'd be willing to work out a deal. I need to get him out of this garage.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.100
It's just time, you know, like I thought we'd get air conditioning,

21:10.100 --> 21:13.900
but we didn't and I figured we'd the shutting them down would be enough.

21:13.900 --> 21:18.600
But it clearly wasn't because there was just some time when just things happened.

21:18.600 --> 21:24.500
And when I went out there and I touched that box that for that Thursday night that evening.

21:24.500 --> 21:27.500
It was so hot. I could barely keep my hands on it.

21:27.500 --> 21:30.100
That's what you know, it's like how can this system last right?

21:30.100 --> 21:33.100
It just it possibly could make it a little bit longer.

21:33.100 --> 21:39.100
But eventually this box is going to die and those boxes that have been given to us by the audience are going to die.

21:39.100 --> 21:43.100
And it's not like they're, you know, especially that box. It's not in the show path.

21:43.100 --> 21:46.500
We don't need it to do our recording. So yeah, we just got to get it.

21:46.500 --> 21:50.000
We got to get it hosted and coloed. It's been a fun experiment.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.900
But if anybody out there has any any ideas or hook us up,

21:53.900 --> 21:56.200
let us know because I think what are you laughing about?

21:56.200 --> 22:00.100
I just like the idea, you know, you sort of taking care of these things,

22:00.100 --> 22:04.100
trundling out to the garage, you know, checking on them,

22:04.100 --> 22:09.100
touching them, logging in the old fashioned way with the little, the ancient LED LCD monitor.

22:09.100 --> 22:12.100
It's my first LCD screen I bought ever, a hundred years ago.

22:12.100 --> 22:13.100
4-3 ratio, right?

22:13.100 --> 22:18.100
Yeah, of course. I think it's a 14 inch screen, which it's a KDS,

22:18.100 --> 22:20.300
which I don't even think that brand is around anymore.

22:20.300 --> 22:22.800
I think they died long, long time ago.

22:22.800 --> 22:27.900
And just think now you get credentials to go into a data center that could potentially lock you out

22:27.900 --> 22:33.600
if there's a BGP error. How much fun would that be?

22:33.600 --> 22:36.400
I know. This is where I'm not really a big fan of this idea,

22:36.400 --> 22:41.300
is the whole idea with these is it's like large data stuff

22:41.300 --> 22:44.200
that you really only want to transfer over a gigabit LAN anyways,

22:44.200 --> 22:48.300
like source files or media files or things that we want to do.

22:48.300 --> 22:52.900
Like we want to take 15 MP3 files, convert them or FLAC files,

22:52.900 --> 22:55.800
convert them to MP3 and upload them to our radio stream.

22:55.800 --> 22:58.100
Like you don't want to do that necessarily on a cloud box,

22:58.100 --> 23:01.300
but maybe we just got to accept we don't have servers in the summer.

23:01.300 --> 23:03.200
It's just a winter time thing that we do.

23:03.200 --> 23:08.100
Yeah, maybe. You know, one thing that's been really handy is I've broken the tasks up a little bit.

23:08.100 --> 23:10.500
So JOOPS has its own network.

23:10.500 --> 23:13.600
So like my immediate media files and whatnot in my Home Assistant,

23:13.600 --> 23:16.400
I'll run on a local network on a Raspberry Pi.

23:16.400 --> 23:21.000
And then here I have a Home Assistant Blue that runs the Home Assistant automations for the studio.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.800
And then we have one of the Dell systems that we've set up

23:23.800 --> 23:25.800
that's running a lot of the automated tasks that's good to go.

23:25.800 --> 23:28.900
And another system that's running a lot of data storage and that's been fine.

23:28.900 --> 23:33.000
And those don't even need to be on 24-7, so I can just leave them off for days at a time.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.700
But FakeNAS was like, I needed to turn it on like once a day.

23:36.700 --> 23:41.300
You know, it's not always great to turn a server on and off all the time either.

23:41.300 --> 23:46.200
You know, they tend to just like to stay on at a good even temperature.

23:46.200 --> 23:51.500
I feel bad. It's like they're my garden, you know, and I'm not growing some weird fruit.

23:51.500 --> 23:56.300
Yeah, I got weeds in my garden. I'm not watering them properly, you know.

23:56.300 --> 23:59.200
Chris, you were going to touch on lessons learned.

23:59.200 --> 24:02.900
I feel like we can make quite a list out of that story.

24:02.900 --> 24:05.100
Do you think that's a nice idea?

24:05.100 --> 24:09.600
Yeah, my lesson is colo. That's my lesson. Colo, idiot.

24:09.600 --> 24:15.700
That's the overall lesson, but I feel like try not to get cottonwood in your servers.

24:15.700 --> 24:17.900
That's a good lesson, right? Rule number one.

24:17.900 --> 24:21.000
Maybe the wind tunnel wasn't the best idea.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Get some filters for your wind tunnel.

24:23.000 --> 24:27.800
Yeah, and then pull the trigger on setting up that whole temperature sensor thing

24:27.800 --> 24:30.300
with the smart plugs that you were going to do last year.

24:30.300 --> 24:31.500
Like a year ago.

24:31.500 --> 24:35.400
Yeah, it would also be good like maybe we shouldn't put everything into production

24:35.400 --> 24:39.600
until we have the cooling and the rack solution done because I thought we would get that done.

24:39.600 --> 24:42.200
That's my fault. I'm going to take that one.

24:42.200 --> 24:44.000
Alex, do you have any advice?

24:44.000 --> 24:49.400
Nothing that hasn't already been said. I mean, it's all obvious, isn't it?

24:49.400 --> 24:51.200
Back up your configs, kids.

24:51.200 --> 24:54.800
This is Uncle Chris telling you right now.

24:54.800 --> 24:57.400
I just had a brush with death and my first thought was,

24:57.400 --> 25:01.800
I don't know if I backed up the configs.

25:04.800 --> 25:08.200
Linode.com slash unplugged. Go there to get a hundred dollars

25:08.200 --> 25:09.700
and 60 day credit on a new account.

25:09.700 --> 25:12.600
And it's just a great way to support the show and check something great out.

25:12.600 --> 25:16.500
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting with the best support in the business.

25:16.500 --> 25:20.400
Underscore that real humans all the time. Take out your highlighter,

25:20.400 --> 25:23.400
even though sometimes it makes the ink blur a little bit.

25:23.400 --> 25:26.200
Highlight this. The best support in the business.

25:26.200 --> 25:28.500
Man, does that matter when it really matters?

25:28.500 --> 25:29.600
You're thinking about it.

25:29.600 --> 25:34.700
I've been getting notes from audience members who were maybe on a different cloud provider

25:34.700 --> 25:38.600
who's been changing things recently and they're just not very happy anymore.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.100
And they're looking to migrate.

25:40.100 --> 25:44.300
I've also heard from some of you out there who have looked for like the ultimate budget provider

25:44.300 --> 25:46.600
because you just got a cheap machine you're throwing together.

25:46.600 --> 25:49.600
And the next thing you know, it's been running for three months.

25:49.600 --> 25:53.400
It's kind of important to you and now you want it somewhere better.

25:53.400 --> 25:58.400
Well, that credit works for you to go to Linode.com slash unplugged and just try it out for a bit.

25:58.400 --> 26:02.700
It could also be a great way to try out something like a multi-cloud strategy this summer.

26:02.700 --> 26:08.300
Our garage slash server room in air quotes to the extreme.

26:08.300 --> 26:12.200
It's getting up to like 90 degrees, 92 degrees, 93 degrees some days,

26:12.200 --> 26:17.700
especially if I parked the hot car in there and the reality is it's been a peace of mind

26:17.700 --> 26:19.500
knowing on the during summer.

26:19.500 --> 26:23.900
I just moved some of this stuff over to Linode and I don't I don't really need it here in the garage.

26:23.900 --> 26:25.700
Sure. I'd like to have access on my land,

26:25.700 --> 26:30.900
but the reality is Linode's infrastructure is so fast that it's typically faster than my own gear.

26:30.900 --> 26:35.500
Anyways, like even locally. It's crazy because they are their own ISP

26:35.500 --> 26:37.300
and they have 11 data centers around the world.

26:37.300 --> 26:40.000
So for this kind of stuff, I'll just pick the one on the on the West Coast,

26:40.000 --> 26:44.300
right? You pick the one closest to you and then they have MVME disks in there.

26:44.300 --> 26:47.100
They have AMD epic processors for the dedicated GPU machines.

26:47.100 --> 26:50.800
In fact, if you want physical hardware to they can work with you on that.

26:50.800 --> 26:53.700
Linode's constantly adding new features like database as a service.

26:53.700 --> 26:57.500
So that we've you just want Linode to run your Postgres or MySQL your Mongo.

26:57.500 --> 26:58.700
They'll do it for you.

26:58.700 --> 27:01.800
They'll bring their expertise that they've collected for the last 19 years

27:01.800 --> 27:05.400
and they'll bring it to something like a hosted database service.

27:05.400 --> 27:07.800
Nobody else has this combination of features

27:07.800 --> 27:10.300
and this is the place you go to support the show too.

27:10.300 --> 27:13.700
It's a win-win. So go check it out. I think you're really going to like it.

27:13.700 --> 27:17.800
If you've been considering it, maybe migrating from one of those other providers.

27:17.800 --> 27:20.500
Maybe you're just done with the hyperscalers crap.

27:20.500 --> 27:22.700
Go try out Linode. You know, what's up.

27:22.700 --> 27:25.000
linode.com slash unplugged one more time.

27:25.000 --> 27:32.800
Just go to linode.com slash unplugged.

27:32.800 --> 27:35.700
With some small website updates on the new website.

27:35.700 --> 27:41.800
We have something like I think it's something like 60 people now in our matrix chat room

27:41.800 --> 27:45.300
that are keeping updated on the new website, which is pretty amazing.

27:45.300 --> 27:49.300
And I was able to recently convince Alex to jump into the project

27:49.300 --> 27:51.500
and I think that was a good thing.

27:51.500 --> 27:53.900
Hello. What have you been up to this week?

27:53.900 --> 27:55.600
What haven't I been up to?

27:55.600 --> 27:58.600
We've been doing a lot of infrastructure work a lot of basic plumbing

27:58.600 --> 28:02.400
and stuff like that that actually just needs the JB crew.

28:02.400 --> 28:07.400
I suppose to do it really because you know, we you know, there are servers at the end of the day.

28:07.400 --> 28:15.000
We're using GitHub actions to fully automate the deployment of the building of the Hugo site

28:15.000 --> 28:19.600
and then deploying that to a Linode node.

28:19.600 --> 28:24.700
I never know what to call them. I used to call them droplets back in the day, but you know Linode nodes.

28:24.700 --> 28:29.800
We changed the URL of the website and you did some fancy DNS stuff, didn't you?

28:29.800 --> 28:32.600
Ah yes, this was a long time ago actually.

28:32.600 --> 28:41.400
The orange one and I wrote some pretty ninja level, which probably means hacky as F Ansible code,

28:41.400 --> 28:47.400
which automatically scans the Docker compose file for the relevant traffic labels

28:47.400 --> 28:53.000
and then automatically updates the Cloudflare DNS records using Ansible under the hood.

28:53.000 --> 28:58.700
So you could, for example, spin up a new container have the correct traffic label against that container

28:58.700 --> 29:02.200
and not need to open Cloudflare and type it all in and all that kind of stuff.

29:02.200 --> 29:05.500
Now you could argue you could do that using Terraform,

29:05.500 --> 29:10.000
but the advantage of doing it this way with Ansible is it's just one command.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.500
It's all in one place and it's all automated.

29:12.500 --> 29:17.100
That's awesome and we do have a new URL that we want everybody to use

29:17.100 --> 29:19.700
and also please we need some people to test the new website.

29:19.700 --> 29:22.000
So Alex, what did you make the new URL?

29:22.000 --> 29:26.600
We thought long and hard deep into the night about how to name this thing.

29:26.600 --> 29:31.000
new.jupitabroadcasting.com

29:31.000 --> 29:35.400
So that's where the new website is being sort of tested for now.

29:35.400 --> 29:37.700
If you just go to jupitabroadcasting.com,

29:37.700 --> 29:42.400
it's currently the old WordPress website that's still functional and still up to date and everything.

29:42.400 --> 29:47.500
But the new website that we're building is at new.jupitabroadcasting.com

29:47.500 --> 29:53.900
and if you want to get more involved, please join our matrix room and also check out our GitHub.

29:53.900 --> 29:57.400
Don't forget also coming up in this week's Office Hours,

29:57.400 --> 30:00.200
we're going to do a deep dive into a lot more of the configuration

30:00.200 --> 30:05.400
and the plans for continuous integration and feature branches and all that kind of stuff.

30:05.400 --> 30:07.800
I'm looking forward to that.

30:07.800 --> 30:08.800
A lot of good stuff.

30:08.800 --> 30:11.600
Yeah, so if you're coming in and you're going new website, what are you guys talking about?

30:11.600 --> 30:14.000
Yeah, we've been covering this in officehours.hair.

30:14.000 --> 30:19.200
This is a new community project that's just absolutely incredible and it's coming along.

30:19.200 --> 30:21.800
Brent says small updates, huge updates.

30:21.800 --> 30:27.400
It's a whole brand new website statically generated on demand when we publish a new episode

30:27.400 --> 30:31.200
and it's coming together and we're kind of in the final stretch and we'd love your feedback.

30:31.200 --> 30:34.200
So we do have our GitHub page where you can give us some feedback,

30:34.200 --> 30:36.900
but just go check it out at new.jupitabroadcasting.com

30:36.900 --> 30:39.500
Chris, you got a nice new feature as well this week, didn't you?

30:39.500 --> 30:41.900
This is so cool.

30:41.900 --> 30:45.200
So, oh man, this is a great time to be building this website

30:45.200 --> 30:50.200
because we're kind of embracing new ideas and new ways of doing stuff.

30:50.200 --> 30:52.100
And one of them is PeerTube.

30:52.100 --> 30:53.200
Yeah.

30:53.200 --> 30:56.400
We're back on the PeerTube bandwagon, baby, at jupiter.tube

30:56.400 --> 31:00.100
and we want to start using that for our live stream in bed because,

31:00.100 --> 31:03.100
you know, just today as we were getting ready to start the show,

31:03.100 --> 31:04.600
we started playing a song and we realized,

31:04.600 --> 31:08.000
oh no, this might actually get us kicked off of YouTube just playing this.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.500
And so as we move forward, it's like,

31:09.500 --> 31:14.000
why do we want to keep promoting Google's platform or Amazon's platform with Twitch?

31:14.000 --> 31:19.200
Like, why not promote our own free software platform that's not going to take us down?

31:19.200 --> 31:23.500
And so then the next question was, well, shouldn't we be using that as our embed?

31:23.500 --> 31:24.700
But how are we going to do that?

31:24.700 --> 31:29.700
Are we going to like do a new embed for PeerTube every single time we want to do a live stream?

31:29.700 --> 31:30.600
How's that going to work?

31:30.600 --> 31:31.700
And we've been kicking that around.

31:31.700 --> 31:38.700
And this is a great example of our community came in with a solution that is so slick,

31:38.700 --> 31:43.200
so elegant, and they're using a lot of like native technologies

31:43.200 --> 31:44.900
that we're just now implementing like PeerTube.

31:44.900 --> 31:47.800
And they're looking at the PeerTube API and they're saying,

31:47.800 --> 31:51.900
how can we use this to properly embed a live stream on the new website?

31:51.900 --> 31:53.400
And the guys dug through it.

31:53.400 --> 31:56.300
And they found a way where when we go live on PeerTube,

31:56.300 --> 31:58.400
it can automatically update the website.

31:58.400 --> 32:00.500
And I don't know if it's changing the embed at the website

32:00.500 --> 32:04.800
or if the embed is just somehow auto updating, but it is so,

32:04.800 --> 32:07.300
I don't do anything but go live

32:07.300 --> 32:11.300
and the website automatically gets the new embedded live stream from PeerTube.

32:11.300 --> 32:12.300
Just how it should be.

32:12.300 --> 32:14.600
It's so cool.

32:14.600 --> 32:19.300
It's so cool like we're building and we're building a page that talks about how to do boost.

32:19.300 --> 32:21.700
So that way we have all that explained in one place.

32:21.700 --> 32:24.900
And in the future, I imagine you'll actually be able to boost from there.

32:24.900 --> 32:26.800
We've got a page for the memberships.

32:26.800 --> 32:30.700
We've got a page for all of the hosts, our swag store, the calendar.

32:30.700 --> 32:34.000
And of course, the new player is so slick.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.700
It supports chapters.

32:35.700 --> 32:38.600
It supports a lot of the new podcasting 2.0 spec.

32:38.600 --> 32:40.700
It's an open source player itself, Podverse.

32:40.700 --> 32:42.900
I'll talk about that more in the show.

32:42.900 --> 32:48.000
It's all coming together in one statically generated website

32:48.000 --> 32:50.800
that's going to just load beautifully and fast for everybody, hopefully.

32:50.800 --> 32:54.000
And the neat thing is like, you know, you mentioned the player.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.800
Well, the Podverse player, Mitch over there, was happy to collaborate with us

32:57.800 --> 33:01.500
and we went back and forth for, I don't know, something like two weeks,

33:01.500 --> 33:04.400
sending some requests for certain features and they built it in

33:04.400 --> 33:07.400
and then they'd send a request from us to do something a little differently.

33:07.400 --> 33:11.800
It's been really cool to interact with other open source projects as well in our efforts.

33:11.800 --> 33:16.300
So, I think everyone over at the website creation team, I think big applause

33:16.300 --> 33:18.300
and thank you for making this so much fun.

33:18.300 --> 33:22.100
Yeah, I think that actually is worth just talking about a little bit more is

33:22.100 --> 33:25.400
we didn't intend for this to happen, but there's been some other projects

33:25.400 --> 33:29.600
that have gotten bug fixes and they've made some improvements and changes

33:29.600 --> 33:31.900
as we've been building this website.

33:31.900 --> 33:35.100
It really has been a collaborative open source project, which is just really awesome.

33:35.100 --> 33:37.300
We didn't necessarily intend for that to happen, but…

33:37.300 --> 33:38.600
Freaking open source.

33:38.600 --> 33:40.900
Yep, and all of this that we're doing, it's all up on our GitHub.

33:40.900 --> 33:41.900
It's all there.

33:41.900 --> 33:45.500
While we're talking about Podverse, I might as well mention that

33:45.500 --> 33:49.800
the Android and iOS clients are getting boost support.

33:49.800 --> 33:51.700
It's in F-Droid right now.

33:51.700 --> 33:55.800
As we record, I believe this morning, it's landing in the Play Store

33:55.800 --> 34:00.000
and it is currently in review on the Apple iOS Store,

34:00.000 --> 34:04.200
but version 4.60 has boosting in the mobile client as well.

34:04.200 --> 34:08.500
So, Podverse is one of these podcasting 2.0 clients we like a lot

34:08.500 --> 34:12.400
because they have an iOS, Android, and web player.

34:12.400 --> 34:13.900
It's all GPL.

34:13.900 --> 34:18.600
It's available in F-Droid if you'd likes it and it's embeddable too as a player.

34:18.600 --> 34:24.500
So, you as a listener could create a Podverse FM account with the online player

34:24.500 --> 34:26.400
and then when you go to our website, you could play it in there

34:26.400 --> 34:30.900
and you could click a little button and bring it into your overall Podverse list of podcasts.

34:30.900 --> 34:32.800
It's going to be very slick.

34:32.800 --> 34:34.600
So, do check out Podverse.

34:34.600 --> 34:39.900
They are iterating quickly and it'll be landing in Play and the App Store this week

34:39.900 --> 34:44.200
and it's already in F-Droid, a brand new version with lots of fancy features

34:44.200 --> 34:46.200
and they're just a great team.

34:46.200 --> 34:48.500
Like Brent said, we worked with them on the website.

34:48.500 --> 34:50.300
It's been awesome.

34:50.300 --> 34:52.800
So, Podverse.fm for that.

34:52.800 --> 34:55.000
I think Brent's found a new calling.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.300
I don't know if he realizes it quite yet,

34:57.300 --> 35:01.500
but a new calling as being a scrum master or some kind of a project manager

35:01.500 --> 35:05.800
because he wakes up and I know the first thing he does is he looks at his phone

35:05.800 --> 35:10.700
and checks just how many pull requests have been opened that night, how many issues.

35:10.700 --> 35:13.100
But the other thing I think that we need to just underscore

35:13.100 --> 35:16.400
is how Brent's really driven this community engagement.

35:16.400 --> 35:17.900
I know that you're my friend and everything,

35:17.900 --> 35:19.500
but I think you've done a great job with it.

35:19.500 --> 35:19.900
Well done.

35:19.900 --> 35:21.700
Well, thank you.

35:21.700 --> 35:23.200
Round of applause.

35:23.200 --> 35:26.100
And we're just, and really, not to early celebrate,

35:26.100 --> 35:28.200
but we're really close to the finish line, right?

35:28.200 --> 35:31.200
Like we're so close and I don't think we'd be there if it wasn't for Brent's work.

35:31.200 --> 35:34.800
So, of course, Stefan and really there is an entire team of people.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.500
If you go to GitHub, there's a huge team.

35:36.500 --> 35:39.500
Go to GitHub, look at the Jupiter Broadcasting Com Insights

35:39.500 --> 35:41.200
and look at the last 30 days.

35:41.200 --> 35:42.300
It's going to blow your mind.

35:42.300 --> 35:44.700
It's so awesome, isn't it?

35:44.700 --> 35:45.500
It's incredible.

35:45.500 --> 35:46.600
It's really amazing.

35:46.600 --> 35:50.800
Yeah, I think it outpaced what we were expecting

35:50.800 --> 35:52.500
and I think that's really exciting.

35:52.500 --> 35:54.200
You know, in like 14, 15 years,

35:54.200 --> 35:57.500
I think it's the most successful community project JB's ever done.

35:57.500 --> 35:59.300
So, and a big part of that is thanks to Brent.

35:59.300 --> 36:02.600
Big part of that thanks is to Stefan and really just the incredible community we've built

36:02.600 --> 36:04.500
and the philosophy of value for value

36:04.500 --> 36:06.900
because it's not always just sats and dollars,

36:06.900 --> 36:08.300
it's time and talent as well.

36:08.300 --> 36:09.200
Absolutely.

36:12.100 --> 36:13.900
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

36:13.900 --> 36:17.600
Go there to get started with a free trial for an individual or a business.

36:17.600 --> 36:19.400
It's Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

36:19.400 --> 36:23.200
It's just the easiest way for you or a team of people

36:23.200 --> 36:27.400
to manage secrets and pass phrases, things that really are important.

36:27.400 --> 36:30.400
And Bitwarden is open source, so you know that their security is audible,

36:30.400 --> 36:31.800
it's open, it's transparent,

36:31.800 --> 36:35.300
and it's trusted by millions of individuals and teams in their community.

36:35.300 --> 36:37.200
It's what we use to manage our passwords,

36:37.200 --> 36:40.500
our two-factor codes, and other sensitive recovery keys

36:40.500 --> 36:42.600
for the applications that require that.

36:42.600 --> 36:46.700
And then it's also how I manage to have complex secure passwords on my mobile device

36:46.700 --> 36:50.000
because I also have Bitwarden installed on my mobile devices.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.700
I put it in my browser.

36:51.700 --> 36:53.500
I grab the app from Flathub

36:53.500 --> 36:54.900
because they've got a flat pack of Bitwarden,

36:54.900 --> 36:56.700
which is great for getting a new system set up.

36:56.700 --> 36:59.100
And I put it on my mobile devices.

36:59.100 --> 37:02.900
And I always appreciate the little changes that come down the pipe from Bitwarden,

37:02.900 --> 37:06.300
the little improvements, the tweaks, the iteration on the UI,

37:06.300 --> 37:10.500
things that just make the workflow smoother like account switching.

37:10.500 --> 37:12.900
And recently, I mean like just last week,

37:12.900 --> 37:16.800
they got support for cross-domain identity management right there in Bitwarden.

37:16.800 --> 37:19.200
So like for enterprises,

37:19.200 --> 37:24.200
it makes it so much easier now to provision Bitwarden for your users.

37:24.200 --> 37:26.300
They also recently added a username generator.

37:26.300 --> 37:29.800
So that way you can have a unique username and a unique password

37:29.800 --> 37:32.400
for every website and service that you sign up for,

37:32.400 --> 37:34.700
but not just username and password.

37:34.700 --> 37:37.100
They also have an option to create an email alias

37:37.100 --> 37:39.700
for each service or website that you sign up for.

37:39.700 --> 37:42.900
You know, it just routes it through simple logon or Firefox Relay.

37:42.900 --> 37:45.900
And then the service doesn't know really anything about you.

37:45.900 --> 37:47.300
And if they get a breach,

37:47.300 --> 37:51.900
which a service I use just had a breach last week,

37:51.900 --> 37:54.900
then it doesn't share your identifying information,

37:54.900 --> 37:57.800
something that you might use on another site or service, right?

37:57.800 --> 38:01.600
It's just that site and services information.

38:01.600 --> 38:03.300
So it's limited in its damage.

38:03.300 --> 38:06.000
It's going to do just small things like that,

38:06.000 --> 38:08.600
using a password manager, using a unique password,

38:08.600 --> 38:10.600
using a unique username,

38:10.600 --> 38:14.100
and even a unique email address for every website and service you use

38:14.100 --> 38:17.400
is going to greatly enhance your online privacy and security.

38:17.400 --> 38:19.900
It might just be the number one thing you can do.

38:19.900 --> 38:25.600
And Bitwarden is the tool that makes this actually doable and manageable.

38:25.600 --> 38:27.800
So go try it out for yourself or your business.

38:27.800 --> 38:31.400
Go try it for free at bitwarden.com slash Linux.

38:31.400 --> 38:33.200
It's also a great way to support the show.

38:33.200 --> 38:35.200
Maybe you already know all this,

38:35.200 --> 38:36.500
but maybe somebody you know,

38:36.500 --> 38:38.200
maybe a teammate at work needs to hear this,

38:38.200 --> 38:40.000
maybe a friend-ish.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
I mean, if they're a friend, you've already had them switch to Bitwarden.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.400
But I'm not going to make judgments.

38:43.400 --> 38:45.600
Maybe a family member you don't talk to very often.

38:45.600 --> 38:46.700
We'll frame it that way.

38:46.700 --> 38:48.600
Maybe they need to know about Bitwarden.

38:48.600 --> 38:50.500
Send them over to bitwarden.com slash Linux.

38:50.500 --> 38:55.300
One more time, to support the show, it's bitwarden.com slash Linux.

39:01.400 --> 39:03.600
Now, you know we have some meetups to talk about here.

39:03.600 --> 39:06.300
Let's get a little bit of meetup going here.

39:06.300 --> 39:10.000
We have not one, not two, but maybe like four or five coming up.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.800
September 20th, Southern Oregon.

39:11.800 --> 39:14.000
September 23rd, Northern California.

39:14.000 --> 39:17.400
September 29th, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

39:17.400 --> 39:20.300
September 30th, Southern California.

39:20.300 --> 39:23.600
October 7th, Northern Oregon.

39:23.600 --> 39:26.900
All of them, meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

39:26.900 --> 39:30.200
If you're in the area, let's meetup.

39:30.200 --> 39:34.100
We're going to also have some swag on board.

39:34.100 --> 39:38.100
But we'll also, even if you can't make it to the meetup, have something for you.

39:38.100 --> 39:40.600
Brand new idea.

39:40.600 --> 39:45.400
We're going to stash little geocaches along the way.

39:45.400 --> 39:48.200
And then we'll give you hints in the show where you can find them.

39:48.200 --> 39:50.900
So even if you can't make it to the meetup, maybe you can still get some swag.

39:50.900 --> 39:52.300
We're leaving something behind for you.

39:52.300 --> 39:54.900
I got to pick up like some Tupperware containers, I'm thinking.

39:54.900 --> 39:55.900
Don't give it all away.

39:55.900 --> 40:00.000
No, I'm going to put some swag, you know, like shirt stickers, some stuff in there.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.600
Can we do like perishable food items?

40:02.600 --> 40:04.800
That's probably a single hair in each.

40:04.800 --> 40:06.400
Probably shouldn't do like a banana.

40:06.400 --> 40:07.300
Probably shouldn't.

40:07.300 --> 40:08.600
Oh, okay. All right.

40:08.600 --> 40:09.400
Although, how impressive.

40:09.400 --> 40:10.700
That'll tell you how long it's been in there.

40:10.700 --> 40:11.300
Right.

40:11.300 --> 40:12.800
Like if somebody...

40:12.800 --> 40:16.500
What if somebody found it and then took a picture with like a like a still edible banana?

40:16.500 --> 40:18.600
That'd be very impressive, right?

40:18.600 --> 40:20.000
Maybe we should put a banana in there.

40:20.000 --> 40:23.500
I think there's an argument for a banana.

40:23.500 --> 40:24.700
Now get finding y'all.

40:24.700 --> 40:27.300
Yeah. So we'll let you know as we hit the road.

40:27.300 --> 40:31.000
We'll hide them along the way and give you hints here in the show.

40:31.000 --> 40:35.700
But come say hi to us. Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

40:35.700 --> 40:39.400
You know what it is.

40:39.400 --> 40:41.200
I think it's time for some feedback.

40:41.200 --> 40:49.300
Yeah. Up first is actually a listener who found their way here after you were a guest over on the podcasting 2.0 show.

40:49.300 --> 40:50.000
Oh, cool.

40:50.000 --> 40:54.300
Yeah. Arno writes in and has got some questions about the Raspberry Pi.

40:54.300 --> 40:55.800
Maybe you can help us out here, Chris.

40:55.800 --> 40:56.500
All right.

40:56.500 --> 41:00.300
Do you know of any solution for using the Pi on battery power?

41:00.300 --> 41:06.400
Now, specifically with the SmartPi Touch 2, which I guess is like a fancy case that includes a screen.

41:06.400 --> 41:09.300
Unfortunately, Pi juice does not work.

41:09.300 --> 41:13.500
I guess the developer says that the Pi and the screen draws too much power.

41:13.500 --> 41:17.100
Using a power bank with extra cable isn't very portable.

41:17.100 --> 41:20.400
Oh, well, OK, I was going to say that's really how you do it, right?

41:20.400 --> 41:22.300
Because then you can size it to how you needs it.

41:22.300 --> 41:25.400
But of course, I'm thinking not so portable.

41:25.400 --> 41:26.900
How would you do that portably?

41:26.900 --> 41:31.000
The only thing I could really think of is like something like the Moto dock.

41:31.000 --> 41:34.700
But I don't know if that's going to be really easy to get your hands on these days.

41:34.700 --> 41:40.600
I think you got to build yourself essentially a Tupperware container.

41:40.600 --> 41:43.200
With a banana.

41:43.200 --> 41:51.400
And then you put all that in the Tupperware container and then you just make the Tupperware container portable.

41:51.400 --> 41:53.800
OK, OK, well, swing and a miss maybe.

41:53.800 --> 41:56.300
But maybe somebody listening has a better idea.

41:56.300 --> 41:57.700
Here's a second chance over here.

41:57.700 --> 41:58.300
OK, all right.

41:58.300 --> 42:02.500
Do you have any advice for like a good microphone or audio setup to use with the Pi?

42:02.500 --> 42:09.200
I think Arnos tried a USB stick with PCM2902 and a three and a half millimeter jack playback was fine.

42:09.200 --> 42:11.000
But input does not seem to work.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.200
Now, I don't know how you're doing your storage.

42:13.200 --> 42:14.800
So this is going to be the problem.

42:14.800 --> 42:17.700
But you absolutely got to go USB audio interface.

42:17.700 --> 42:23.700
I think something like the Audio Technica ATR could possibly do in this scenario.

42:23.700 --> 42:26.400
I don't know if the Blue Icicle is still easily available too,

42:26.400 --> 42:30.600
but that'll take any XLR mic and make it into a USB mic with just one device.

42:30.600 --> 42:34.500
It's kind of a big device, bigger than the Raspberry Pi, but it's a thing.

42:34.500 --> 42:35.800
That's probably how I would do it, Wes.

42:35.800 --> 42:40.900
The other thing, although we had limited success with it, is you could look at that Raspberry Pi Ninja project.

42:40.900 --> 42:42.600
Maybe they'd have more success than we did.

42:42.600 --> 42:45.700
If so, write back in and let us know.

42:45.700 --> 42:53.000
Another feedback item today from Paul responding to Linux Unplugged 468, the read only scenario.

42:53.000 --> 42:58.700
Before listening, if you had asked me what distros I'd recommend to a new or long term Linux user,

42:58.700 --> 43:02.700
I would not have even thought about suggesting Endless.

43:02.700 --> 43:10.100
But after Lub 4.68, I think I have to say it's an awesome and known nonsense distro.

43:10.100 --> 43:12.900
Years ago, I heard about Endless and the Endless computer,

43:12.900 --> 43:15.000
and I thought it'd be a great idea for my children, you know,

43:15.000 --> 43:18.800
encourage them to start learn coding, that kind of thing.

43:18.800 --> 43:23.300
Anyway, long story short, the laptop was not really used much by my children,

43:23.300 --> 43:27.700
but since my Mac was aging, already no longer receiving updates,

43:27.700 --> 43:30.600
I started using the Endless computer.

43:30.600 --> 43:35.100
While my use case is really just web browsing, email, word processing, and the occasional spreadsheet,

43:35.100 --> 43:40.800
it performs perfectly, especially as this is a pretty low cost machine.

43:40.800 --> 43:45.200
And the time we've had this laptop, I've never had any issue with updates or day to day use,

43:45.200 --> 43:48.700
and we've never had to open the command line to fix or rectify anything.

43:48.700 --> 43:53.400
Now, this could be attributed to our basic use case, the well thought out operating system,

43:53.400 --> 43:55.400
or a combination of both.

43:55.400 --> 43:58.600
I propose we do have a bit of an Endless blind spot.

43:58.600 --> 44:01.000
I think that is true. I think we don't think about Endless very much,

44:01.000 --> 44:05.600
because I think they haven't targeted our user base very much.

44:05.600 --> 44:10.500
But then as we start talking about these immutable systems that we want to just work out of the box for workstations,

44:10.500 --> 44:13.100
I start thinking maybe we should have been looking at Endless more.

44:13.100 --> 44:15.700
So that's great feedback. Thank you for that.

44:15.700 --> 44:20.300
I will put that into like my, you know, the back of my mind.

44:20.300 --> 44:23.200
I feel like we've done the immutable thing quite a bit.

44:23.200 --> 44:24.400
Do we need to do another one?

44:24.400 --> 44:26.300
But Endless is kind of its own thing.

44:26.300 --> 44:28.100
When was the last time we really gave it a go?

44:28.100 --> 44:30.400
We've never. I don't think we've ever looked at it.

44:30.400 --> 44:31.700
Infinity got it.

44:31.700 --> 44:34.400
Really?

44:34.400 --> 44:41.100
You know, the Endless computer kind of piques my interest from what we've been talking about lately with these low end computers as well.

44:41.100 --> 44:43.900
So it's almost like a two episode hit here.

44:43.900 --> 44:46.300
I was gonna say we could send Brent off for a field report.

44:46.300 --> 44:48.000
I'm not sure I follow the logic.

44:48.000 --> 44:51.700
It's not like we wouldn't cover Arch if we just covered Ubuntu though, is it?

44:51.700 --> 44:55.400
So not covering it because we already just covered Nix.

44:55.400 --> 44:56.800
Like they're different things.

44:56.800 --> 44:58.700
Yeah, you're right. No, you're right. You're right.

44:58.700 --> 45:06.500
I feel like too, where it fits is I think it could be a solid competitor to Pop or Elementary or Mint.

45:06.500 --> 45:09.000
I think if you're one of those users.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.100
One of those users. What are you saying?

45:11.100 --> 45:14.800
One of those Pop users.

45:14.800 --> 45:16.400
Wait, don't we sometimes?

45:16.400 --> 45:19.800
I just like a lot of punctuation in my Linux distribution, okay man?

45:19.800 --> 45:22.700
I think sometimes. Wait a minute. That's us sometimes. Wait.

45:22.700 --> 45:24.700
Yeah, all right. All right.

45:24.700 --> 45:27.000
All right. You guys are probably right.

45:27.000 --> 45:30.300
I imagine. I mean, we should probably look at it.

45:30.300 --> 45:31.400
I don't know. Okay.

45:31.400 --> 45:32.700
You know, I don't mind trying it.

45:32.700 --> 45:35.100
I think I've had Fedora on this laptop for a little bit.

45:35.100 --> 45:38.200
It's been a mixed bag that maybe we'll talk about.

45:38.200 --> 45:41.600
I don't mind jumping on and let's give it a shot.

45:41.600 --> 45:44.300
He says so casually over there. These little nuggets.

45:44.300 --> 45:48.900
I would like a long-term review and then maybe we should do this next week.

45:48.900 --> 45:52.300
Now, the more we talk about it, the more I'm kind of wanting to do it.

45:52.300 --> 45:54.000
All right. Okay.

45:54.000 --> 45:59.200
We'll put it up for discussion in the committee after the show.

45:59.200 --> 46:02.200
And now it is time for the boost.

46:02.200 --> 46:06.700
wooden501 wrote in with 3,000 sats.

46:06.700 --> 46:13.400
I have two B-Link Mini S systems and an ASUS PN41 that I'll be using to learn Kubernetes on.

46:13.400 --> 46:15.700
An actual tiny cluster of systems.

46:15.700 --> 46:20.900
They're all running NixOS with GNOME wonderfully with a combined TDP.

46:20.900 --> 46:22.900
What's TDP? I'm out of the loop here.

46:22.900 --> 46:25.900
Oh, total, total, Alex, total power, I think.

46:25.900 --> 46:29.000
Power draw? Draw of power. Total draw of power.

46:29.000 --> 46:32.200
That's my best guess. Of only 36 watts,

46:32.200 --> 46:37.200
which was definitely a major consideration when my electric supply cost more than doubled this year.

46:37.200 --> 46:45.000
All three ran Windows 11 fine for all the five minutes each it took to get the Windows license registered with the account.

46:45.000 --> 46:48.200
Not that I'm ever likely to use those licenses.

46:48.200 --> 46:52.100
Not related to the question, but TDP is thermal design power.

46:52.100 --> 46:54.400
Yeah, that's what I said.

46:54.400 --> 46:57.300
You're close, definitely close, definitely, definitely close.

46:57.300 --> 47:00.400
wooden501 also sent in an off-air boost.

47:00.400 --> 47:02.400
Now, Chris, what's an off-air boost?

47:02.400 --> 47:06.600
So one of the things we've decided to do is, I think we're, I think, I can't remember,

47:06.600 --> 47:09.900
honestly, because we're kind of flying by the seat of our pants here.

47:09.900 --> 47:11.200
Don't reveal our secrets, man.

47:11.200 --> 47:13.400
I think it's a 2,000 sat limit to get on air.

47:13.400 --> 47:15.100
It might have been 1,000. I can't remember.

47:15.100 --> 47:17.700
I think you said 1,000 last episode, but I could be misremembering.

47:17.700 --> 47:19.300
You should have just said a row of dots.

47:19.300 --> 47:20.100
Here's the thing, Chris.

47:20.100 --> 47:23.100
You said 1,000 in LUP, and then you said 2,000 in self-boasted.

47:23.100 --> 47:24.300
I think that's where you're confused.

47:24.300 --> 47:25.500
And Coder, right?

47:25.500 --> 47:28.700
Because I'm trying to realize, because I'm just, we want to keep it tight,

47:28.700 --> 47:34.000
but we also will read every single boost that's sent in, and every now and then we'll pull one forward.

47:34.000 --> 47:37.200
And so Wooden had 1,000 boost here, and I thought, you know,

47:37.200 --> 47:42.700
we should read this one because he says that E Ink display tablet you got could be a good boost board.

47:42.700 --> 47:43.700
And I agree.

47:43.700 --> 47:45.500
Brent's got a node.

47:45.500 --> 47:47.100
You know, that's a good idea.

47:47.100 --> 47:49.600
You'd basically need to get like Firefox or something working.

47:49.600 --> 47:51.500
That's all you'd really need to display it.

47:51.500 --> 47:53.700
So it seems a little heavy on that, but we'll see.

47:53.700 --> 47:55.100
We'll see. Everything's possible.

47:55.100 --> 47:57.400
I think going forward to keep the segment tight,

47:57.400 --> 48:03.600
we're going to set the minimum at 2,000 boosts for an on air read, but 2,000 sats,

48:03.600 --> 48:07.700
but we'll read 100% all of them sent into the show,

48:07.700 --> 48:10.100
and maybe every now and then pull one or two of them ahead.

48:10.100 --> 48:14.500
Rasta Calavera, a.k.a. Rasta Casta Versa.

48:14.500 --> 48:15.900
Give that man a banana.

48:15.900 --> 48:17.800
wrote in with a row of ducks.

48:17.800 --> 48:18.900
Thank you kindly.

48:18.900 --> 48:23.300
Apparently Chris really butchered his name last week, so apologies there.

48:23.300 --> 48:24.300
Yeah, apologies.

48:24.300 --> 48:26.100
I like Rasta Casta Versa.

48:26.100 --> 48:28.200
I think that's a great name.

48:28.200 --> 48:33.900
So Rasta Casta Calavera wrote in suggesting.

48:33.900 --> 48:35.200
Should I try that again?

48:35.200 --> 48:37.200
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

48:37.200 --> 48:40.900
Okay, spell it.

48:40.900 --> 48:54.200
I am now Rasta Casta Versa and expect the Rust audio clip when I boost.

48:54.200 --> 48:57.700
They write, Brent, you should start a Calibre web instance

48:57.700 --> 49:00.500
and send cool things to that E Ink display

49:00.500 --> 49:04.000
or use it as a GPS navigator when you drive.

49:04.000 --> 49:05.700
That's not a bad idea.

49:05.700 --> 49:09.100
I'm thinking a Mario-like map that shows you moving around the country.

49:09.100 --> 49:12.000
Meetups are all the bonus levels.

49:12.000 --> 49:13.800
Hey, that's a fun idea.

49:13.800 --> 49:14.800
What's the castle?

49:14.800 --> 49:16.000
Is that my real question?

49:16.000 --> 49:18.900
Hmm, the studio and your place and Alex's place,

49:18.900 --> 49:21.800
like, you know, major landmarks could be castles.

49:21.800 --> 49:23.400
Don't you think?

49:23.400 --> 49:26.000
I think maybe we'll do the live tracker again for this road trip.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.400
If we can get all our ducks in a row,

49:28.400 --> 49:30.300
I think we should do the live tracker again

49:30.300 --> 49:33.800
because the nice thing about that is it did lead to a few micro meetups.

49:33.800 --> 49:35.400
One, two, three, four people.

49:35.400 --> 49:36.700
Very true. Yeah, that was fun.

49:36.700 --> 49:38.200
It's fun following you along.

49:38.200 --> 49:40.800
Yeah, so we might set up the tracker again.

49:40.800 --> 49:42.100
We only got a few creeps. It was fun.

49:42.100 --> 49:43.200
Yeah, it was totally good.

49:43.200 --> 49:47.800
All right, next boost comes in from DFJ-225 with 16,000 SATs.

49:47.800 --> 49:52.500
Because I'm a back home bowler in pajamas that cost $10.

49:52.500 --> 49:55.500
Hey, folks, I've been itching to use Rust for a project

49:55.500 --> 49:58.000
and I've got a few Raspberry Pi's laying around

49:58.000 --> 50:00.800
wondering if you've got any recommendations

50:00.800 --> 50:03.800
for a useful or fun project idea.

50:03.800 --> 50:05.600
Thanks.

50:05.600 --> 50:08.500
And Wes, you just tossed a link here in the notes.

50:08.500 --> 50:09.900
Yeah, I mean, it can be a little tricky.

50:09.900 --> 50:12.300
A, because you can do so much on the Raspberry Pi

50:12.300 --> 50:15.200
and then B, of course, you know, you can do a lot of things with Rust.

50:15.200 --> 50:18.100
So it kind of depends on what areas you're interested in.

50:18.100 --> 50:23.000
But it looks like there's a Raspberry Pi operating system

50:23.000 --> 50:26.700
like writing an embedded OS in Rust targeting the Pi.

50:26.700 --> 50:29.700
And I mean, I might have to try that because that sounds fun.

50:29.700 --> 50:32.200
Interesting. Well, that's pretty great.

50:32.200 --> 50:34.400
I was just going to suggest put Linux on there

50:34.400 --> 50:35.900
and get the Rust tools installed

50:35.900 --> 50:37.700
and just play around with some different projects.

50:37.700 --> 50:39.700
And it's fun just to be on an ARM system and all.

50:39.700 --> 50:43.300
Yeah, I mean, there is a little bit of like getting used to that as well.

50:43.300 --> 50:46.100
All right, 412 Linux boosts in with 2048 SATs,

50:46.100 --> 50:48.300
which I think is actually a gigabyte boost.

50:53.600 --> 50:56.600
Is this live audio from the server room?

50:56.600 --> 50:59.200
Oh, the cottonwood's back.

50:59.200 --> 51:01.700
It's almost that old. It is almost that old.

51:01.700 --> 51:05.300
He says, I agree that the boosts do provide an easy way to get feedback into the show.

51:05.300 --> 51:07.600
I've been listening to the podcast.

51:07.600 --> 51:09.600
I've been listening to your podcast since 2005

51:09.600 --> 51:12.900
and many things have gotten easier regarding podcasts.

51:12.900 --> 51:15.800
It used to take effort to get podcasts onto mobile devices.

51:15.800 --> 51:17.500
I mean, remember having to use juice?

51:17.500 --> 51:21.100
Now it just happens automatically on our pocket computers.

51:21.100 --> 51:25.300
Boosts are the next evolution for easy feedback straight up from the app.

51:25.300 --> 51:29.600
I listen right there and I can send it from my pocket computer while I listen.

51:29.600 --> 51:31.000
Great content as usual.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.900
Thanks, everyone. Great job.

51:32.900 --> 51:35.600
Well, thank you very much, 412. That's incredible.

51:35.600 --> 51:38.100
I mean, you're a podcast OG.

51:38.100 --> 51:42.000
So I respect your opinion on that.

51:42.000 --> 51:46.300
Nev writes in, before really I was firm on the 1000 or 2000 SAT thing.

51:46.300 --> 51:47.600
So he's making it under the wire.

51:47.600 --> 51:49.500
So you mean before like five minutes ago?

51:49.500 --> 51:50.600
Yeah, like five minutes ago.

51:50.600 --> 51:51.500
Gotcha. Yep.

51:51.500 --> 51:54.300
Also, Nev's like such a long timer that I feel like, you know,

51:54.300 --> 51:56.000
Coming in hot with the boosts.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.500
Nev boosts in with a hot 1877.

51:58.500 --> 52:06.700
1877 SATs is the year Ernst Warner von Siemens invented the first ever moving coil microphone.

52:06.700 --> 52:07.500
How about that?

52:07.500 --> 52:09.200
That's great to know, Nev.

52:09.200 --> 52:16.400
Also, PSA Ohio Linux Fest will be soon, coming up soon at the Hamilton Hotel in Columbus, Ohio.

52:16.400 --> 52:20.000
December 2nd to the 3rd. That's not that soon.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.700
But it is a good amount of notice to get your plans in order.

52:22.700 --> 52:26.200
Get your plans in order. With the price of tickets, it's a good idea.

52:26.200 --> 52:28.000
Of course, Nev's going to be there.

52:28.000 --> 52:31.700
I would love to hear if the community wants to put a meetup together.

52:31.700 --> 52:34.400
I know a couple of decent spots in Columbus.

52:34.400 --> 52:35.100
Nice. All right.

52:35.100 --> 52:36.000
We got to figure this out.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.300
Maybe we should create a Columbus Matrix room.

52:38.300 --> 52:39.900
So let's make a note.

52:39.900 --> 52:43.300
We'll make a Columbus Matrix room and we'll link to it in the show notes.

52:43.300 --> 52:45.500
It'll also be listed in the overall space.

52:45.500 --> 52:46.500
We got to remember to do this.

52:46.500 --> 52:48.000
Christmas in Columbus.

52:48.000 --> 52:49.800
Yeah, Christmas in Columbus.

52:49.800 --> 52:54.600
I don't know if we'll be there, but I really don't feel like that should be a reason these meetups shouldn't happen.

52:54.600 --> 52:57.500
We're starting to see these self-organized and why the hell not?

52:57.500 --> 52:59.400
Because the audience is full of awesome people.

52:59.400 --> 53:00.400
Think about it.

53:00.400 --> 53:01.900
Think about what the chances are.

53:01.900 --> 53:05.400
If somebody else is also a listener to this show, it's likely you're going to get along.

53:05.400 --> 53:06.100
Such great taste.

53:06.100 --> 53:07.800
It's crazy how well it works.

53:07.800 --> 53:11.300
All right. Marcel boosts in with some dirty 30sats.

53:11.300 --> 53:12.100
30-30.

53:12.100 --> 53:13.200
Yeah.

53:13.200 --> 53:15.500
That's the Kool-Aid Man, by the way, if you didn't know.

53:15.500 --> 53:16.900
Yeah.

53:16.900 --> 53:20.300
Because if you are in your 30s, you know who the Kool-Aid Man is.

53:20.300 --> 53:25.500
Is this the original Kool-Aid Man or is this the Family Guy pastiche of Kool-Aid Man?

53:25.500 --> 53:33.600
But to stay true to the medium, I looked up how many years ago was 30 years ago, which is like the early 90s, of course, obviously.

53:33.600 --> 53:35.700
I think you'll find it was exactly 30 years ago.

53:35.700 --> 53:36.800
Yeah, it turns out.

53:36.800 --> 53:40.800
And I went and found commercials on YouTube from that time.

53:40.800 --> 53:45.000
And then I grabbed the Kool-Aid Man from the summer commercials of that era.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.400
And that's why this show is technically historical fiction.

53:47.400 --> 53:50.200
That's right. And I'm just putting it out there.

53:50.200 --> 53:54.000
Like if you wanted to help with the boost sound clips, you want to get some variety into the show.

53:54.000 --> 53:57.200
This is my process. You know, I was like, OK, 30 years ago.

53:57.200 --> 54:00.400
All right, let's go to what it was on TV. And I just went and got something.

54:00.400 --> 54:01.700
And we'll never talk about it again.

54:01.700 --> 54:04.900
And you'll only know if you've listened to this episode what that's a reference to.

54:04.900 --> 54:06.400
And that's just how it works.

54:06.400 --> 54:09.600
There we go. All right, moving on.

54:09.600 --> 54:13.700
This is a crazy episode. Marcel writes for the member bet line.

54:13.700 --> 54:19.500
We were talking in the post show about how to create a system for the members of unplugged core to get a hold of us.

54:19.500 --> 54:23.900
If you want to build it into the app, the only thing you can really do these days is boosting the member feed.

54:23.900 --> 54:29.800
You'd need to set up a wallet and you'd need to have like maybe some expectations on your end of lower amounts.

54:29.800 --> 54:32.800
But I know some people don't like the boost or they don't want to get into it.

54:32.800 --> 54:37.000
So maybe a secret web form could work. It's a bit high friction.

54:37.000 --> 54:43.800
Maybe a secret matrix channel. Yeah, we're thinking about a bad line for the members.

54:43.800 --> 54:47.300
Matrix channel came in a couple of times as a suggestion.

54:47.300 --> 54:50.400
I wonder how feasible that is. Would it stay secret?

54:50.400 --> 54:54.700
Would it? Huh? I don't know, but we're going to figure something out.

54:54.700 --> 54:57.700
Yeah, there's a lot of good options. Let us know if you have any thoughts.

54:57.700 --> 55:02.700
Next up in the boost department from the PMO fam with a row of ducks.

55:02.700 --> 55:05.300
This old duck still got it.

55:05.300 --> 55:09.100
Giving Fountain a try on Android, sending a row of ducks for Brent's gas tank.

55:09.100 --> 55:11.100
Aww. Oh, thank you. Thanks fam.

55:11.100 --> 55:14.400
Oh, thanks. It runs on fuel, but ducks will work too.

55:14.400 --> 55:17.900
Oh, and you know, the PMO fan did not stop there.

55:17.900 --> 55:21.200
Another row of ducks. Oh, double boost.

55:21.200 --> 55:27.900
And you know, I guess tossing in the talent of agreement here,

55:27.900 --> 55:31.100
the package manager debate is annoying as hell.

55:31.100 --> 55:33.500
Oy to all the vays.

55:33.500 --> 55:37.000
Can I just say, this week alone,

55:37.000 --> 55:42.200
there was at least two different threads on our Linux about package managers again.

55:42.200 --> 55:45.600
Can we just like, here's a wild proposal.

55:45.600 --> 55:49.900
Could we just get some sort of group consensus to stop talking about it

55:49.900 --> 55:51.800
and just let the market decide?

55:51.800 --> 55:58.000
And whichever end users end up using, we just go with and we stop debating it endlessly?

55:58.000 --> 56:00.100
Yeah, but what if it snaps?

56:00.100 --> 56:02.900
Yeah, that's true. What if it is snaps?

56:02.900 --> 56:06.100
That's a good point Wes. I can't argue with that.

56:06.100 --> 56:11.600
Space Ninja wrote in as well with 15,703 sats.

56:11.600 --> 56:12.600
Oh!

56:12.600 --> 56:17.600
Because I'm a back home baller, if I want something I just holler.

56:17.600 --> 56:20.800
I've been running Mint on an HP ProBook from 2011

56:20.800 --> 56:25.700
that has a dual core i5 and 8 gigs of RAM since about Mint 18.

56:25.700 --> 56:29.300
I love it as a mobile, just hop in and write some code device.

56:29.300 --> 56:33.700
It's been really stable and I just upgrade only every couple of years.

56:33.700 --> 56:38.200
Oh, that sounds dangerous, but apparently works fine.

56:38.200 --> 56:41.300
I don't know. If it works, how nice would that be?

56:41.300 --> 56:44.300
Sounds hassle free to me, you know?

56:44.300 --> 56:49.000
They continue, my custom main rig has had just about every distro on it,

56:49.000 --> 56:53.800
but I recently circled back to Mint because I'm done fiddling because of lack of time.

56:53.800 --> 56:59.700
So it's VM only for testing and Mint 7.365 every day of the year.

56:59.700 --> 57:03.300
I've only loved watching this little distro since about version 15.

57:03.300 --> 57:06.800
Hey, that's way better than going back to the Mac or Windows. Am I right?

57:06.800 --> 57:08.700
Mm-hmm. Yeah, if it works for you.

57:08.700 --> 57:11.600
And in fact, I really appreciate that. It does give us good perspective.

57:11.600 --> 57:13.600
That's a really good use case to keep in mind.

57:13.600 --> 57:18.300
Well, and I feel like maybe Mint hasn't really changed that much since back then.

57:18.300 --> 57:21.700
I used to use it, I think it was around 17.

57:21.700 --> 57:23.800
17 is when I first got in, right up to 19.

57:23.800 --> 57:29.200
And the way that it doesn't like totally change the paradigm is also, I think, maybe an advantage.

57:29.200 --> 57:31.000
Yeah, it's a feature.

57:31.000 --> 57:34.100
Sure, for certain workloads, yeah.

57:34.100 --> 57:38.700
Emvon also wrote in with 2,000 sats, thanks for the weekly episodes,

57:38.700 --> 57:43.100
plenty of material to get me through 30 hours of driving out to the East Coast.

57:43.100 --> 57:46.100
30 hours, 30 hours.

57:46.100 --> 57:49.000
You know, when you say something like that, that's such a tease.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.900
Envy, you got to boost it and tell us like, where are you driving?

57:51.900 --> 57:54.900
Give us more. Because the commuter is the original podcaster's friend

57:54.900 --> 57:56.700
and there's less and less.

57:56.700 --> 57:59.800
And now we're hearing about new ways people are finding to listen to podcasts.

57:59.800 --> 58:02.000
I'm always curious, like if you were a commuter

58:02.000 --> 58:05.700
and you transitioned to like listening to the show during a different routine,

58:05.700 --> 58:07.300
what was it and how did it go?

58:07.300 --> 58:08.900
And are you able to stay current?

58:08.900 --> 58:10.800
I guess I'll find out. Boost it and let us know.

58:10.800 --> 58:14.400
But also, Envy, what are you doing?

58:14.400 --> 58:18.100
What are you driving? 30 hours of driving, is that per day?

58:18.100 --> 58:20.400
Are you driving more than there are hours in the day?

58:20.400 --> 58:23.000
Are you a time traveler? You got to give us more details, man.

58:23.000 --> 58:24.600
Is that there and back or just one way?

58:24.600 --> 58:27.700
Well, it's clearly just got to be, it's one way, right?

58:27.700 --> 58:30.200
I mean, it's got to be. There's no details, I assume.

58:30.200 --> 58:33.800
RobinWeb74 also wrote in with 3000 cents.

58:33.800 --> 58:35.600
Coming in hot with the boost.

58:35.600 --> 58:38.000
Hello from Slovenia.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.400
How many listeners do we have from my country?

58:40.400 --> 58:41.900
I like your shows. Thank you.

58:41.900 --> 58:44.600
I'll be first to say Slovenia isn't like the top of our list.

58:44.600 --> 58:47.000
But a lovely place I'd love to visit.

58:47.000 --> 58:49.300
You know, interesting factoid about Slovenia

58:49.300 --> 58:52.300
is that they have a reciprocal arrangement with Slovakia

58:52.300 --> 58:56.000
that they actually return each other's posts with the wrong address on it

58:56.000 --> 58:59.300
because they get confused so often.

58:59.300 --> 59:02.600
Well, I did look up the numbers before the show.

59:02.600 --> 59:08.800
We have just over 10,000 listeners as of this morning in that area.

59:08.800 --> 59:10.300
That is impressive.

59:10.300 --> 59:13.400
Which is just beating out the Republic of Lithuania

59:13.400 --> 59:16.200
where we have 9.2 thousand listeners.

59:16.200 --> 59:22.000
And just above Slovenia is Croatia with 10.6 thousand listeners.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
We love all of you and it's not a contest.

59:24.000 --> 59:25.500
Don't worry, but it might kind of be a contest.

59:25.500 --> 59:27.900
Yeah, it might be. It might be. But isn't that neat though?

59:27.900 --> 59:28.600
That's amazing.

59:28.600 --> 59:32.300
Yeah, and of course in that same region is Turkey and Saudi Arabia

59:32.300 --> 59:35.500
kind of in those same numbers a little bit more about 12,000 in Turkey.

59:35.500 --> 59:37.700
I was blown away when I saw that absolutely blown away

59:37.700 --> 59:43.800
and a little a little humble reminder that this is your world's largest Linux podcast

59:43.800 --> 59:47.600
and the numbers show it and those are to the hundreds.

59:47.600 --> 59:50.000
I mean like right down. I'm telling you Republic of Lithuania.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.900
I can tell you 9,217, right?

59:52.900 --> 59:54.300
Like it's beautiful.

59:54.300 --> 59:58.000
This old duck still got it lower third writes in longtime listener.

59:58.000 --> 59:59.900
First time booster.

59:59.900 --> 01:00:04.200
It's a real Mario and Luigi situation when it comes to Linux hardware on the cheap,

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:08.400
but it's good to know that mate Mint and XFC have us covered.

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:09.600
Great show.

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:12.900
Or is it more of a Wario and Waluigi type situation?

01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:15.300
I don't know.

01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:19.200
I love it when we get a longtime listener first time booster.

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.400
That's growing the Lightning Network

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:24.500
and the Lightning Network is a peer-to-peer free software Network

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:28.600
and we are seeing more and more free software projects come on

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:33.100
and that means imagine the day when your favorite free software project.

01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:34.100
Maybe it's VLC.

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:34.900
Maybe it's Nano.

01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:39.100
If you're a gentleman, you know, your favorite free software project comes online

01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:40.400
to the Lightning Network

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:44.200
and you've got a wallet full of Satoshis because you've been listening to our podcast.

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:48.400
That's how you start to monetize free software is we're building a network right now.

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:49.900
It's going to make a difference.

01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:53.900
And so when we get Chiron aka lower third coming on for the first time after listening,

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:55.100
we're building to that Network

01:00:55.100 --> 01:01:00.400
and there are now over 7,000 almost 8,000 podcasts on the Lightning Network.

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:03.800
So that is pretty gosh-darn exciting.

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:14.900
Mr. Quackers comes in with $2,222.

01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:16.100
That's another road, Dux.

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:17.100
Quacka Wacka.

01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:18.000
It's a treasure.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.600
Yippee.

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:26.500
They say the Asus VivoBook L2-03MA, 175 bones on Amazon.

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:27.400
It's small.

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:31.500
Not very powerful, but Fedora and KDE works just fine on there.

01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:36.400
It's not necessarily compatible with a FWAP manager, you know, you know for your LVSS.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:38.100
The old FWAP D.

01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:43.200
But you still can update the BIOS from the USB old-school style.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:47.100
I use it if I'm going somewhere and I don't really care if it gets lost or stolen.

01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:48.800
It's just not a big deal.

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:49.900
I haven't used it in a while.

01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:50.600
But you know what?

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:54.200
The battery when I did use it lasted 8 to 10 hours.

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:57.200
I also have an X1 Carbon Fedora Edition.

01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:01.600
I think the recent BIOS update or maybe it was a kernel version increased my battery life to an extra hour.

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:03.200
Have you experienced that?

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:07.700
So my X1 Carbon has gotten better with time on Fedora as well, Quackers.

01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:08.800
And Nix as well.

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:09.500
It is better now.

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:12.100
It's still not the battery life where I'd like it to be,

01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:16.200
but I swear it is better than where it was when I first got it, which when does that happen?

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:23.100
And you know, Wes and I follow the kernel updates pretty closely for the Linux Action News over there.

01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:30.900
And we have definitely seen a stream of Intel driver updates and improvements for power management from both AMD and Intel in the last year.

01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:37.300
So I think it's absolutely the case that when you get a newer kernel, when people say why do you want a new kernel in your Linux?

01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:40.500
Well, because it's usually faster and it has more hardware support and improvements.

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:41.800
That's why, obviously.

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:46.100
But yeah, I think a kernel update does improve your battery life because I've seen it happen.

01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:48.600
Quackers came in with a dubs boost with a row of ducks.

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:51.400
Things are looking up for old nut duck.

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:57.400
Just to clarify, I did mean the Asus VivoBook L203MA Ultra Thin Edition.

01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:58.400
It does look pretty nice.

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:02.400
You know, it's got one of those 180 degree like fold flat screen kind of thing.

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:07.600
It's pretty light. It's got USB-C. Really not bad for like $175.

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:08.800
What?

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:10.600
$184 at the time I'm looking at this.

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:11.800
Alright, even still.

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:13.800
But you know, you could get it by Friday.

01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:15.800
I mean, that's not bad, right?

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:16.600
That's not bad.

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:18.600
A machine by Friday during these days?

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:19.600
Not so bad.

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:23.300
SourceD just comes in with nothing but a row of ducks.

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:25.300
That's very helpful, love ya.

01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:26.800
Thank you for the ducks.

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:29.300
We also got some thank you boosts that I wanted to cover on the show.

01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:31.800
I'll just do a selection of these under the $2000 mark.

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:34.300
1701 SATs from True Grits.

01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:39.600
Also doubling down on the idea of an unplugged core member's matrix exclusive chat room.

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:40.700
I don't know how the heck we'd do it.

01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:42.000
Maybe just a private URL.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.700
But alright, we got a few plus ones for that.

01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:48.200
Mega Strike 3 sent in $2000 SATs.

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:49.700
Just gas money for Brent.

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:51.200
Thank you, thank you.

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:55.200
And we got $1000 SATs from iBookie with a question that I wanted to cover.

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:58.200
So what happens if I send a boost in and I think you guys missed it?

01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:00.200
What should you do?

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:06.200
So the easiest resolution is when you boost in, if your username matches your matrix username,

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:08.200
a lot of times I'll just coordinate with you on matrix.

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:13.200
We'll get boosts in under $2000 SATs and I will follow up with them on matrix.

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:18.200
The Golden Dragon boosted in just under $2000 SATs and so we were talking about a new board

01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:20.200
that he has that I think would be good for Home Assistant.

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:23.700
Because he uses the same username in the boosts that he uses on the matrix, right?

01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:25.200
So I can track him down that way.

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:28.200
But otherwise, if you're not on matrix, you can always send me an email.

01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:29.700
Chris at JupiterBroadcasting.com.

01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:33.700
Just give me a screenshot or a copy of it and we'll get it all sorted out.

01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:38.200
I try to read 100% of them, but I am but one man.

01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:43.700
However, Wes Payne has concocted a few ideas on how we'll be able to actually just import those messages

01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:48.700
into our various channels as appropriate down the road in the future, which is going to be really cool.

01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:55.700
Because it all turns out, I'm not even kidding, all of these boosts live in a database

01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:58.700
that has a Rust front end with an API.

01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:01.200
Well, you won't even install non-Rust software anymore.

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:04.200
I keep trying to get you to consider some fun picks, but you just won't.

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:08.200
That Dave Jones, he did it right. So yeah, we'll have that coming soon.

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:13.200
If you'd like to send a boost into the show, go grab a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com.

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:14.700
You can also check out Podverse.

01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:18.700
We mentioned that earlier. That's going to now have boosts on your mobile clients.

01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:22.200
And then if you really want to make it nerdy, Boost CLI.

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:25.200
Although I think you got to have your own node and you got to have a command line client.

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:27.700
So it's like, don't think of those as bad things.

01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:30.700
Just think of them as additional challenges to get your boost to the next level.

01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:34.200
Chris, I wonder, will you commit to reading all the Boost CLI?

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:37.700
All right, for next week. Yeah. Yeah, for next week.

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:38.700
We'll do it. We'll do it. We'll do it.

01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:45.700
Because I think it's so cool because you got to get like a bunch of free software going to make it happen.

01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:47.700
Got a couple of picks for you this week.

01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:50.200
I have been trying out Fluffy Chat.

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:51.700
You guys familiar with Fluffy Chat?

01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:57.700
It's one of the ones that have come up when we rattled off alternative matrix clients to Element.

01:05:57.700 --> 01:05:59.700
And I thought, let's give it a go.

01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:01.700
They've got a desktop version.

01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:03.200
They've got a mobile version.

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:04.700
It's even an F-Droid.

01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:06.200
It's in the App Store for Apple.

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.700
It's in the Play Store for Googs.

01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:09.700
You can run it in your browser.

01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:12.200
It's also available as a Flatpak and a Snap.

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:14.700
All right, so all of the bases are covered.

01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:21.200
And it looks like a Telegram UI on top of Matrix or maybe a more traditional chat client.

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:27.700
And so the idea is something other than Element to kind of make the Matrix chat experience a little more palatable.

01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:29.700
It's early, but I like it.

01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:38.700
And I think it's really, really good for one or two Matrix instances you're on, maybe for friends and family.

01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:40.700
I can see it really useful for that.

01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:42.700
Does it do threads?

01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:43.700
Yeah, I think so.

01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:46.700
I actually don't know if I've engaged in any threads, but I think so.

01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:48.700
Does it do encrypted DMs?

01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:50.700
Yeah, yeah, it does do that.

01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:53.700
And it supports spaces and that kind of stuff.

01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:59.200
It's actually really, it's got most of the chat experience you want and it is open source as well.

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:02.700
So it's up on GitLab and there is an F-Droid repo for it.

01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:03.700
How fluffy is it?

01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:04.700
It's pretty fluffy.

01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:07.700
I miss Element when I use it, I have to be honest.

01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:10.700
It really does get that like base experience with.

01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:16.700
I set my wife up with Element so that way she could participate in our West Coast crew Matrix room for the road trip.

01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:18.700
And I gave her Element and it's been fine.

01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:22.700
But I realized afterwards maybe that would have been a good opportunity for fluffy chat

01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:27.700
because it just operates and looks more like a traditional chat client.

01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:29.700
I don't know how else to put it.

01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:32.700
And so if Element has been the sticky point for you in adopting Matrix,

01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:34.700
I think fluffy chat is worth looking at.

01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:41.700
For myself, after using Element for a while, I am no longer really suffering from those pain points that I was.

01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:48.700
My brain has made the adaptations necessary and the Element team has made some of the improvements and we just kind of met halfway.

01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:53.700
So you said pretty fluffy, but I think it's more of like a zero to cottonwood in your server kind of scale today.

01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:55.700
Yeah, I'd say it's cottonwood.

01:07:55.700 --> 01:08:00.700
I'd say it's cottonwood, but not like jammed up your air vents so your hard drives are overheating cottonwood

01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:03.700
or plugging up your power splitters kind of cottonwood.

01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:10.700
It's just like fluffy, nice to see cottonwood going through the air and you're like, oh, it's like it's snowing in August.

01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:15.700
Wes, you found us a little command line tool for the learning and the educationals.

01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:18.700
Yeah, that's right. Maybe you're trying to do some kind of spaced repetition.

01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:20.700
You've got something you're studying for.

01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:25.700
Now there is the great Anki program that maybe folks have used, open source,

01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:31.700
great little powerful intelligent flashcard system, but it can be kind of a lot sometimes if you, you know,

01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:36.700
you're the kind of person that might procrastinate by fiddling with things and trying to set up their new tool

01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:39.700
more than just using that tool, which has happened to me before.

01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:44.700
So try Learn, L-R-N, it's just a simple little terminal app.

01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:47.700
You can prefill it with a bunch of self-prepared questions or flashcards.

01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:51.700
And then you've got two modes in the match mode. You type an answer to a question.

01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:56.700
Otherwise, you can do like a cards mode that's more like just a traditional little flashcard where you get to see the question

01:08:56.700 --> 01:08:58.700
and then flip the answer and you kind of decide if you knew it or not.

01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:01.700
And it's on the command line. I'm sure you said that, but it's all on the command line.

01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:06.700
So you can just bring it up in your terminal and get to learning.

01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:10.700
That's pretty great. L-R-N. We'll put a link to that in the show notes.

01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:16.700
So you can find all that at linuxunplug.com slash 471.

01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:19.700
And I'd love some suggestions for picks as well.

01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:23.700
You can send them in via the contact page, linuxunplug.com slash contact,

01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:26.700
or you can boost them in with your new podcast app as you do.

01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:30.700
And of course, I want to invite you live. Get in here. Join us.

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:38.700
It's an experience to watch us live. I mean, kind of take some of the shine off, I have to say,

01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:41.700
because, you know, it's like you can really enjoy a hot dog,

01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:45.700
but then when you go to the factory and see how they make the hot dog.

01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:50.700
Yeah, Brent won't put, he just won't put on a shirt.

01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:55.700
Yeah. So, I mean, you could take the factory tour if you like over at Jupiter.Tube.

01:09:55.700 --> 01:10:00.700
We do the show live every Sunday at noon Pacific, which is like 3 p.m. East Coast time,

01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:03.700
3 p.m. Alex time over at Jupiter.Tube.

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:07.700
See you next week. Same bad time, same bad station.

01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:12.700
And a big, very hearty thank you to our members who help give us the runway to talk to the sponsors

01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:15.700
we feel are appropriate for our audience.

01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:19.700
They give us the flexibility to say no to those weird emails that come in.

01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:24.700
And of course, they help orient us from a business perspective towards our audience.

01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:27.700
You can become an Unplugged Core member over at unpluggedcore.com

01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:32.700
or support the entire network of shows over at Jupiter.Party.

01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:38.700
And last but not least, if you'd like to contribute a bit of value in the time and talent sense,

01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:46.700
go check out new.JupiterBroadcasting.com, get a look-see on, hook your peepers on the new website,

01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:48.700
and then head over to our GitHub.

01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:53.700
You'll find our Jupiter Broadcasting.com GitHub project and give us your feedbacks

01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:57.700
and maybe contribute your time for your fixings and your codes.

01:10:57.700 --> 01:10:58.700
That's a thing, right?

01:10:58.700 --> 01:11:00.700
Who knows? You might just see a wild Brent.

01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:01.700
You never know.

01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:04.700
And then last but not least, if you want more news, you want more Linux,

01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:06.700
you want to know what's going on in the world of open source,

01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:09.700
LinuxActionNews.com.

01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:38.700
Thanks so much for joining us. See you right back here next Sunday.

01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:50.700
Hey, breaking news here.

01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:51.700
Hi, bitch.

01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:56.700
But I've just been informed by Kenji over in the chat room that it turns out me accidentally

01:11:56.700 --> 01:12:01.700
mentioned Anki, a little flashcard app, they're converting their Python code base to Rust.

01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:02.700
Oh, no.

01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:04.700
Sneaky last-minute Rust pick.

01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:05.700
Can't escape it today.

01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:08.700
That's three different Rust drops in one show.

01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:11.700
And Linux 6.0 isn't even here yet.

01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:12.700
We need to follow in.

01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:15.700
We need to follow up on that server update, Wes.

01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:17.700
You got your SSH session still going over there?

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:19.700
Oh, I do.

01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:20.700
Come on now.

01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:22.700
You forgot all about it, didn't you?

01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:23.700
No, no.

01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:28.700
Well, we've been, because Arch is like running Gen 2, we've been building our AUR helper,

01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:29.700
you know?

01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:30.700
Oh, good.

01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:31.700
I'm glad we're doing the AUR updates, too.

01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:33.700
Wouldn't want to miss the AUR updates.

01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:37.700
I mean, hey, DFS, DKMS is in there.

01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:38.700
That's actually true, yeah.

01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:39.700
Oh, right.

01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:44.700
That is a problem with the way we do it on Arch, is the DKMS module for ZFS is in there.

01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:48.700
Is it the only problem?

01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:51.700
So where is it at right now?

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:53.700
Still building.

01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:59.700
But, you know, all the main AUR updates, we did have a whole lot of GPG signatures to

01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:02.700
update, so I just ended up doing that in a separate step to before, because that was

01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:03.700
going to be simpler.

01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:06.700
That is the biggest problem when you don't update an Arch box in a while, is all the

01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:07.700
GPG keys.

01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:10.700
But after that, main upgrade went totally smooth.

01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:11.700
All right.

01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:12.700
So our main upgrade's done.

01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:13.700
Yeah, we got a new kernel and stuff.

01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:15.700
We're going to get some updated ZFS.

01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:20.700
Going to make sure that that's going to build.

01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:37.700
Find out next week, I guess.
