1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,040
Gotta say happy birthday before we start the show to Debian.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,420
Debian turned 23 today.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,900
Happy birthday, Debian, and we'll be talking more about it later in the show.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,340
They have a really cool timeline we'll be covering.

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,760
It is Debian Day.

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,720
Let's start the show, everybody.

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:33,280
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 158 for August 16, 2016.

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,080
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's celebrating Debian's 23rd

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,080
birthday.

10
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,080
My name is Chris.

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,080
My name is Wes.

12
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,080
Hello, Wes.

13
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,200
I am really looking forward to today's show.

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,000
We have a fun show lined up.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,680
We got a bunch of really, really good updates from the community we're going to get into.

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,840
Mr. Sipes is here from, or formerly from, the Mycroft Project to give us an update on

17
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,720
what he's doing.

18
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,800
We have some really good Firefox news, which is the first time I've got to say that for

19
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,800
a while.

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,800
It warms my heart.

21
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,800
It does, doesn't it?

22
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,800
It feels really good.

23
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,420
And then I'm going to throw a challenge in Wes's face to see if he can get something

24
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,860
done by the end of the show.

25
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,680
Then later on in the show, we're going to celebrate Debian's birthday by talking about,

26
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:18,760
of course, what the future holds for Debian, and where Debian may be going, and where some

27
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,760
of the places it's come from.

28
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,040
And a little look at the Debian timeline, which is super fascinating.

29
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,000
Really some good stuff to share with you guys.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,280
And then we'll wrap it all up and see how Wes does on the challenge.

31
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,560
So the question is going to be coming in pretty soon, because rumors have it that your friends

32
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,160
in Cupertino will be releasing a new MacBook soon.

33
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,200
Hey, oh, it's been about time.

34
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,900
Jeez, it is ridiculous.

35
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,720
And you know what's going to happen.

36
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,900
The current models, which are still perfectly usable, will go up on eBay, and people can

37
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,560
buy them for a reduced price.

38
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,520
And we have a pretty common question that comes into the show.

39
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,320
How do you install Linux on the MacBook?

40
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,320
Does it work?

41
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,320
What should I know about?

42
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,320
So this week-

43
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,120
Is it worth the amount of effort that might be required?

44
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,640
Have you ever done this before?

45
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,840
You know, I have, but it's been, oh boy, probably three years at least.

46
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,840
So this week-

47
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,320
Actually, I was installing Debian.

48
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,320
Really?

49
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,320
That's great.

50
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:15,520
I'm going to see if by the end of the show, Wes can get Arch Linux or maybe Fedora Linux,

51
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,800
where we'll see, running on a MacBook.

52
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,600
It's like a late 2013 model, I think.

53
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,400
And we'll kind of give you a report of what it's like to try it, if he can get the dedicated

54
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,920
graphics working, the wireless working, and we'll give you a review, so that way some

55
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,400
people out there, they just want that hardware.

56
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,960
And this is an old production rig that we have that's like, it's good.

57
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,520
I'd like to see if you could leave macOS on there, because I think a lot of people are

58
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,680
going to want to do that.

59
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,360
Based on the emails we've received, people want to do a boot, and I can understand that.

60
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,360
Yeah, absolutely.

61
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,360
And if you want to do more updates-

62
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:50,200
Wes, I officially am handing you this Linux-unplugged branded thumb drive, which contains the latest

63
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,200
official released Antigros image from last month.

64
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,680
Sure, it's signed with the JB signing.

65
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,200
Oh yeah, I checked it for sure.

66
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,200
Oh yeah, for sure.

67
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,200
Absolutely.

68
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,200
So there you go, Wes.

69
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,200
Good luck to you.

70
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,200
Thank you, sir.

71
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,600
There is a, it is already partitioned into two separate, well there's the OS 10 partition,

72
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,840
because I've played with Linux on there before, is like already shrunk down.

73
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,040
And so there is like a, there's like right now I just made it like fat or something for

74
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,680
you that you can mess around with.

75
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,160
So there you go, Wes.

76
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,480
The challenge is officially launched.

77
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,400
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

78
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,640
Hey, before we go any further, let's bring in our virtual lug to dig through the community

79
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,640
updates.

80
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,640
Time appropriate.

81
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,640
Greetings, Mumble Room.

82
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,640
Greetings, program.

83
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,400
Greetings, how's it going?

84
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,400
Very good.

85
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,400
Hello.

86
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,640
I am excited to share this Firefox news story with you guys.

87
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,440
So we put it right here at the top of the community updates.

88
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,680
Firefox 49 for Linux is going to be gaining plugin free support for Netflix and Amazon

89
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,800
streaming.

90
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,800
This is super nice.

91
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,000
No more crazy workarounds, no more depending on Chrome.

92
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,680
I know a lot of Firefox users who have Chrome installed just so they can watch Netflix.

93
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,680
So this is cool.

94
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,400
And it's really another plugin biting the dust.

95
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,160
They're using that Widevine, how do you say that?

96
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,160
Widevine.

97
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,160
Widevine.

98
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,720
Widevine technology, which is created by Google, I believe, right?

99
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,960
But Google has released it freely.

100
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,800
And now Firefox will be integrating that and they specifically plan to publish support

101
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:17,540
for Linux users in September in Firefox 49.

102
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,540
That is great.

103
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,080
That's a big equalizer.

104
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,720
This and electrolysis is making Firefox look super attractive again.

105
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,360
Those days where you're just frustrated with Chrome for whatever reason and you're like,

106
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,320
oh, maybe I'll use something else.

107
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,320
Firefox is getting there.

108
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:36,160
For me, the story around how plugins and extensions have to be refactored to support electrolysis

109
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,040
might still be the final decision.

110
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,640
But I know both – have you – I know you've looked at Vivaldi before.

111
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,520
I was going to say both you and I have messed around with Vivaldi.

112
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,840
Yeah, I used it probably for a week or two.

113
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,760
Yeah, I've recently looked into it.

114
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,040
Mr. Tennell there in the Mumba room has been playing around with it.

115
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,840
Michael, has it been specifically – like, has it gotten to the point where it's specifically

116
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,600
ready to switch from Chrome and it solves some of your Chrome frustrations or is it – where

117
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,240
is Vivaldi at in your testing so far?

118
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,440
Well, I mean, actually, I don't like Chrome at all because it does a lot of things I don't

119
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,880
like and I prefer Firefox over everything.

120
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:19,840
However, everything that I didn't like about Chrome has been solved in some way in Vivaldi.

121
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,680
So the things that I – if I went from Firefox to Chrome, I would lose a lot of features,

122
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,040
but all – well, 99% of the features that I would lose are available in Vivaldi.

123
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:36,480
So the transition wouldn't be as bad for me to go from Vivaldi – go to Vivaldi, but

124
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,920
whereas Chrome would basically just not even remotely be an option for me.

125
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,920
Okay.

126
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:47,600
So the tab hibernation specifically is one of the most important things I've seen because

127
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,840
I set up a tab stack where you can put a bunch of tabs into one tab and then you can hibernate

128
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,840
that whole stack.

129
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,840
Oh, that is nice.

130
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,000
So you can take, like, 30 tabs and then hibernate them all so you only have, like, two active

131
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
and you can jump to them wherever you want to.

132
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,360
Oh, all right.

133
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,880
That's really nice.

134
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,600
I have heard – I've read about their – I just never really thought about using it in

135
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,600
that way.

136
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,920
That is a pretty compelling use case for me.

137
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:15,000
Vivaldi is going to switch to Feasible when they have a sync solution.

138
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,640
Web sync and bookmark sync is pretty critical.

139
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,280
Like if I'm upstairs and I'm working on a Google doc for a show today, I have a current

140
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,960
shows folder in my bookmark toolbar that all of my docs for the shows that week that I'm

141
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,180
working on, as I create that doc, I drag it down into this folder and that becomes available

142
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,800
on my machines here in the studio and my machines in my office.

143
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,700
Pretty important to me to have that feature and Firefox has pretty good sync now.

144
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,320
So that's one of the reasons I keep eyeing Firefox.

145
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:46,120
Michael, while you're kind of up and center right now, have you followed at all this theme

146
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,600
pack that makes GIMP look more like Photoshop?

147
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,920
It's something that's been around for a while but just recently got updated and it really

148
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,600
makes GIMP look and – work and look a lot like Photoshop.

149
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,960
And I don't know how I feel about it, but I'm wondering if you've tried it.

150
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,680
I tried it a long time ago.

151
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:08,240
I haven't tried the latest version, but it works in the sense that it brings the UI to

152
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:16,480
a more usable state and not the absurd every tool is like hidden at the bottom of the columns.

153
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:24,200
I like overall, but it's not really necessary because a lot of the things that it does is

154
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,520
not that much different.

155
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,680
Like it does a dual column tool set instead of a single column tool set.

156
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,160
That's cool, but I really don't care.

157
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,640
But the only thing that GIMP has a problem with in my opinion is the fact of where they

158
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,760
put the tools options section.

159
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:47,280
And this theme pack changes or whatever pack it's called, changes it and moves it to the

160
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,280
top right.

161
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,860
So it gives it a lot more prominence.

162
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,240
So that one feature, that one change is probably enough for me to use it.

163
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,240
Yeah.

164
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,280
So it uses some of the same icons, but really a big for probably a lot of switchers is it

165
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,280
uses some of the same keyboard shortcuts, which is –

166
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,920
Oh, and that's the most important part of me for me because I have a – I've used Photoshop

167
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:12,760
for so long that when I go to GIMP, I have to remember – I have to re-learn every single

168
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,720
time all the shortcuts.

169
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,720
Yeah.

170
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,720
Ryan, I kind of wanted to get your thoughts on dragging old design paradigms and ways

171
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,280
of using things from our proprietary days into open source projects.

172
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:31,260
Is this encumbering GIMP in a way that sort of prevents it from sort of branching out

173
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,560
into a different UI design even if it's bad by some people's comparison?

174
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,720
Is there maybe a downside to doing something like this to open source?

175
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:42,200
It seems like it doesn't feel like something that happens to proprietary commercial applications.

176
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,640
I don't think it's bad just because a lot of my friends who have moved from Photoshop

177
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:53,120
to GIMP oftentimes complain about things not being where they're accustomed to and that

178
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,960
it's a lot harder to continue using it.

179
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:01,280
So I tell them about these different things like GIMP Shop and I saw this the other day

180
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:07,440
and sent it over to my dad who used Photoshop for years and years and years before adopting

181
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,920
GIMP and he likes this type of stuff because it puts things in a place that he expects

182
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,920
it to be.

183
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,920
Yeah.

184
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,920
That makes sense.

185
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,920
Yeah.

186
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,840
For my mom who's been a graphic artist and literally lived inside the Adobe applications

187
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:25,780
for the last 25 years, this would be just – it's just simply a matter of like Rotten

188
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:31,080
was saying, Mr. Tunnell, that it is a mapping that's to your – it's like a muscle memory

189
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,080
mapping.

190
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,080
How's the challenge going there, Wes?

191
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,120
I noticed you're inserting the boot drive or the thumb drive for the first time.

192
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,640
Have you been doing research ahead of time?

193
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,640
I did a little bit of research.

194
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,640
I've got it booted.

195
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,640
I'm just – there's some –

196
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,640
Oh really?

197
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,640
Let's just say the word Broadcom is a factor.

198
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,640
Yes.

199
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,640
That is an issue.

200
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,400
Now, I wonder if we don't have an easy way to get you Ethernet either.

201
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,400
That's OK.

202
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,400
I'm working on a –

203
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,760
It wasn't at Apple's best wisdom to include an Ethernet adapter in their pro laptop.

204
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,760
You see, that's silly.

205
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,520
Those are so floppy drive.

206
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:06,880
I think I might even have a USB adapters in my bag but hopefully I won't need it.

207
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,640
I wonder if anybody in the Mamba Room is – moving on from GIMP.

208
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,640
I think we probably said our piece.

209
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,920
I wonder if anybody in the Mamba Room is an Internet of Things advocate or skeptic because

210
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:25,400
this next story is I think extremely good news for an actual manageable Internet of

211
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,240
Things world.

212
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,780
This is a big deal for Canonical.

213
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:36,720
They just struck a deal that is going to put Ubuntu on AdventX x86 based gateways and they're

214
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,200
going to be certified to fully support Ubuntu images.

215
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,680
Now these Internet of Things gateways I think are a pretty sound way to go because you have

216
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:51,040
your various janky, cheap endpoints that are distributed throughout your house that you're

217
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,360
probably going to be replacing every couple of years and you have all of that connect

218
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,480
back to a central gateway device that proxies – oh god, it's weird to hear a Mac sound

219
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,480
on the show.

220
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,480
Sounds terrible.

221
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,480
That is weird.

222
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,480
So –

223
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,480
I apologize everyone.

224
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,080
I got a little shook up there.

225
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:14,200
So it acts as sort of a central proxy to handle like you could manage a lot of these things

226
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,120
centrally from there on your land before it even has to go out to the Internet.

227
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,680
So for that particular device to be the sort of central communication point, to be running

228
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,120
something like an Ubuntu image that is supportable and updatable and likely more secure than

229
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,400
some sort of off-created embedded OS by some hardware manufacturer, I think this is a huge

230
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,400
win for that.

231
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,400
Oh, look at that.

232
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,960
I didn't even know I had that shot.

233
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,680
Well, that's pretty fancy.

234
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,320
So does anybody in the Mumba room have any thoughts on this, on the Internet of Things

235
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:49,920
in general and ways we could prevent a Armageddon where all mayhem has been unleashed on us

236
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,280
because these devices are out of date and unpatched?

237
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,240
I like the idea in general as long as I get to control what it runs.

238
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,240
Yeah, yeah.

239
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,240
Yeah, that's for sure.

240
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,520
Yeah, what it runs and how up to date it remains and how easy that process is are all pretty

241
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,000
key for me, I think.

242
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Yeah, go ahead.

243
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Yeah, yeah.

244
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Very nice.

245
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Very nice.

246
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Sorry.

247
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,840
We all know that like a lot of this stuff right now, we set it and it never gets updated.

248
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:25,640
And so, I mean, that world in which some of these things actually run a legit like operating

249
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:33,720
system that's used in other products and actually gets updates, like that's a win regardless.

250
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,560
I'm delighted to see Mr. Pope here.

251
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,640
I'd be kind of curious to hear your thoughts, Pope, about this particular Git.

252
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,040
It seems like a pretty good position.

253
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,440
Just your personal thoughts on this market for Ubuntu as somebody who's watched the platform

254
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,680
for a long time and maybe the Internet of Things in general.

255
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,680
So hi, Pope.

256
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,680
Welcome back to the show.

257
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,680
Hello.

258
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,680
And your thoughts, sir.

259
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,680
Yeah, it's funny.

260
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,480
You know the old, there's no such thing as the cloud, just other people's computers.

261
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,480
Yeah.

262
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,000
I saw someone do a tweet earlier, I think yesterday, that said, there's no Internet

263
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
of Things.

264
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,280
It's just many unpatched, vulnerable, small computers on the Internet.

265
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,960
And that is so true.

266
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:17,040
And having a platform that is updated, you know, I worry that my home gateways, but not

267
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,520
just home stuff, corporate environment, there are devices on corporate networks of all kinds

268
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,440
which are not updated, not patched, not centrally managed.

269
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,360
And I think it's great that we're making inroads in companies that are making these devices

270
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:39,400
that allow them to be centrally managed and updated and secure and have apps via a store

271
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,400
installed on them.

272
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
I think it's great.

273
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,840
You know, but Google would tell us that we need something like Fuchsia to make this possible.

274
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,840
Yeah.

275
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,160
Can you tell me where I can download that?

276
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,960
Apparently in the future, that's where you can download that.

277
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,960
Okay.

278
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,960
I'll be waiting.

279
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,560
Wimpy, are you a bit of a skeptic on these particular device categories in general?

280
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,760
The only reason I don't mean to label you as a skeptic, but you and I have shared similar

281
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,040
thoughts on the past in regards to VR, which also seems to have the same kind of hype smell

282
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,920
to it.

283
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,920
I don't think Wimpy's there.

284
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,920
Yeah.

285
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,920
Oh, there you are.

286
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,920
Hello, sir.

287
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,920
Hi, Wimpy.

288
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,920
Oh, hello.

289
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,920
Hello.

290
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,920
Can you hear me?

291
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,920
Yep.

292
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,920
Hello.

293
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,920
I think you just have a delay.

294
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,920
Okay.

295
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,920
Yeah.

296
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,960
Oh, dear.

297
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,680
That's unfortunate.

298
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:31,160
Is this the alloy device you're referring to or something else?

299
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,160
It is.

300
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,160
I think it's actually a not-yet-released device by Advantech.

301
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:41,080
So it's basically a full-fledged x86 computer, and I don't think it's a shipping product

302
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,080
yet.

303
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,080
Oh, right.

304
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,080
Yeah.

305
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,080
Advantech Embedded Computing Group.

306
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,080
Now, Poppy, if you know anything different, you want to correct me, but I believe that's

307
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,600
the case.

308
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,920
I don't have an issue with these devices so long as they can actually run Linux of any

309
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:05,360
flavor because then you're able to put a Linux operating system on it after whatever platform

310
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:12,960
they've tried to build out of open source tools and things have sort of passed away.

311
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:17,560
It's when you get these things where their thing that runs Linux is like a heavily patched

312
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:22,920
version and they've never open sourced the patches back so you can't, you know, reutilize

313
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:27,000
the device fully without having to reverse engineer a load of stuff.

314
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,040
Or if they have like an image that they build once in a while, like they use Rootstock or

315
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:37,420
Rootstock NG or something, which builds a root file system that they deploy on the device

316
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:42,000
and then that's it, ships out with that and no one gets any updates unless there's some

317
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,200
kind of deep lead technical user who will go and download the latest image and flash

318
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,200
it on the device.

319
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,280
If it's got no internal way of updating itself, I don't want it on my network.

320
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:59,000
I would much rather have devices that can check in with a central server, get an update,

321
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,400
make sure I've got the latest version of apps, latest version of the core operating system,

322
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,400
whatever that might be.

323
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,520
And yeah, I agree with Martin.

324
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:11,440
If it ships with some form of Linux, then at some point I could potentially put some

325
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,720
other form of Linux that's more secure.

326
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,940
What an excellent point that is.

327
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,720
I think that's exactly it.

328
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,260
And maybe the meta story there is by enabling Ubuntu on this thing, it's opening up for

329
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:26,180
people like us to tinker if we wish, but also giving regular consumers that just use it

330
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,800
with the stock Ubuntu image a pretty fair shot at what seems so far to be a security

331
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,800
disaster.

332
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,580
So either way, it seems like a positive story for even non-Ubuntu users.

333
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,920
So I'm pretty excited about it.

334
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,920
I like that stuff.

335
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,480
And it always felt like it was like, okay, we're going to get Linux on these devices,

336
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,400
but it's not going to be a Linux we trust or a Linux we understand, so if this is real

337
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,400
Ubuntu, that'd be great.

338
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,720
Yeah, I know that.

339
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,620
And I know how to Google for things about Ubuntu, and I know how to read Stack Exchange,

340
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,360
and I can do things with this.

341
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,720
And it kind of goes back to my hesitations with FreeNAS.

342
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,400
I like the product, and here in my business I use it, but in my home, I kind of want something

343
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,920
I feel safe.

344
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:08,760
If I ever got the wild hair to tinker with, I want to be able to.

345
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,600
And I feel like with FreeNAS, I break it.

346
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,760
Yeah, with FreeNAS, I feel like I break it when I tinker it.

347
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,560
But if it's something that's Ubuntu-based, I grok that user space.

348
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,760
I know what I'm doing there.

349
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,080
Okay, so before we continue on, oh, you busted out a USB Ethernet adapter.

350
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,000
I did happen to have it in my bag.

351
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Holy crap!

352
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Respect!

353
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,840
So, okay, I'm guessing connectivity is a major issue, especially for something like Antigros,

354
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,240
which requires connectivity to install.

355
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,040
And I've noticed you've brought the thumbstick back to your Sputnik laptop.

356
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,040
What's going on?

357
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,680
Well, for some reason it's not booting now, so I'm checking the integrity really quick.

358
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,680
I'm also copying the Broadcom driver onto a second USB stick.

359
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,680
Oh, clever, sir.

360
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:50,120
So I will then hopefully be able to reboot, install that driver, and get it installed.

361
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,080
Okay, so Ethernet could be tricky.

362
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,280
That's what I assumed.

363
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,340
If we wanted to take out the wireless here at the JB1 Studios, you could go around the

364
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:03,640
corner and there is an exceptionally long Ethernet cord that powers our wireless that

365
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,640
you could bring it in here.

366
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,760
And I don't think it would take out any of our production systems because they're all

367
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,760
Ethernet.

368
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,480
So, hopefully we will all...

369
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:16,680
Yeah, by the way, I think if you're going to dive into the realm of Linux on the MacBook,

370
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:22,440
if you want to do that, go get yourself a USB Ethernet adapter because that's going

371
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,920
to come in super handy.

372
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:29,480
All right, so we have more updates to get into, and I want to do that, and Mr. Sipes

373
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,480
is here and we definitely want to talk to him.

374
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,720
So before we continue, let's mention our first sponsor.

375
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,520
And that's Ting, my mobile service provider, check them out.

376
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,080
Go over there right now to linux.ting.com and you'll save on your first device or if

377
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,480
you bring a compatible device, they'll give you $25 in credit for your first month.

378
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,320
Now, that's probably going to pay for your first month because the way Ting works is

379
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:54,540
you only pay for what you use and there's just a $6 fee for the line plus Uncle Sam's

380
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:58,960
cut like a mobster and then your usage, just your minutes, your messages, your megabytes.

381
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,360
In fact, they just recently lowered their data prices, which is phenomenal, makes them

382
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,440
incredibly competitive.

383
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:12,640
And they have a system where if you just want to use your device like a couple of times

384
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,180
a month for a few calls, you could save a ton of money.

385
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:23,400
But if you have a busy month where you're making tons and tons of calls, like for me,

386
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:29,160
in April, I'm on the phone every day, sometimes two hours a day.

387
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:37,020
And I have like one month on Ting that's like maybe, I don't even know, $55, $65, $75 depending

388
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,180
on if I'm also using quite a bit of data or something.

389
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:46,380
And then the other months, it's $24, $25, $26, $30, $35, $40 depending on my usage.

390
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,120
It averages out to be an incredible savings over two years over $2,000 and you can get

391
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,120
a feel for it too by using their savings calculator on their page.

392
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,120
It's really nice.

393
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,460
Unlocked devices, no contracts, no other termination fees.

394
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,520
You can get simple feature phones that just make great calls and have a week-long battery

395
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,520
life.

396
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,680
Or you can go get the Cadillac Android devices and everything in between.

397
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,200
You should check out some of their devices.

398
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,200
They all come unlocked.

399
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,200
You own that device.

400
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,320
They're not going to get in the way of updates.

401
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,080
They don't play that carrier game.

402
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,380
I love it.

403
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,840
And they're backed by two cows who have been around since the dot com boom.

404
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,840
Think about that.

405
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,000
Imagine that, making money on the internet since before the dot com boom and actually

406
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,540
doing it in a way that's great because you get great customer service with Ting.

407
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,600
Check them out at linux.ting.com.

408
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,160
It's a better way to do mobile.

409
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,160
I love it.

410
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,740
Thanks, Ting, for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

411
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:34,000
So Mr. Ryan Sipes is joining us, and you've heard him jumping in a few times.

412
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,680
And you may have also heard the news this week that he has departed from Mycroft, the

413
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,560
project that we have talked about a lot on this show, and I'm sure it must have piqued

414
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,740
the interest of a lot of our audience.

415
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:48,640
So Ryan, first of all, I just wanted to say thanks for coming on the show.

416
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,360
And how are you doing?

417
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,360
I'm doing great.

418
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,960
I have a bit more free time on my hands.

419
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,960
That's OK.

420
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,960
Good.

421
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,400
Well, we appreciate you spending some of that podcasting with us then.

422
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,800
So I imagine that you've probably gotten a lot of questions and seen a lot of different

423
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,280
discussions happening online.

424
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,680
Is there anything in particular you wanted to address or any particular feedback items

425
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,240
you wanted to touch on?

426
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:17,240
Mostly, I just wanted to assure everyone that Mycroft is licensed under the GPL version

427
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:27,880
3 and that as a result, regardless of my involvement, the project can continue and people should

428
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:33,040
feel just fine using it and implementing it into their projects.

429
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:40,040
And that's all I'm willing to say right now about it really specifically.

430
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:47,520
I think that if people are keeping up with me online, you have my blog post pulled up

431
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:56,920
there, to just stay tuned and I will kind of bring people into more of the mindset behind

432
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,920
that.

433
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:03,600
But I was really just ready to move on to other projects and this was the best time

434
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,600
to do it.

435
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:11,000
So Ryan, I kind of wanted to talk about you in a different context for a second.

436
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,920
Do you remember how long ago it was that the Mycroft funding campaign launched?

437
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,200
I mean, that was probably the first time I'd really heard your name.

438
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,920
How long ago was that, do you think?

439
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,920
It was September of last year.

440
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:30,080
Okay, so it's not even been a year yet.

441
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,680
Here's what's pretty damn astonishing about that.

442
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:40,840
A year ago, I wasn't thinking a lot about open source artificial intelligence personal

443
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,040
system devices.

444
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,240
It was obviously something the big guys were thinking about.

445
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,560
It wasn't really something on my radar, which I think was a mistake.

446
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:55,800
And then also, I had never heard the name Ryan Sipes before and I didn't know you from

447
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,800
Adam.

448
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:05,200
And now here we are less than a year later and artificial intelligence and voice recognition

449
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,840
and intent parsing are something that we talk about all the time.

450
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,720
And Ryan Sipes is a name that many people are all of a sudden familiar with.

451
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:21,720
And what I find to be extremely illuminating about this particular situation is, at least

452
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:30,240
in my view, it seems to demonstrate how quickly the open source community recognizes good

453
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:37,520
work and talent and how that really can propel you into the general discussion very quickly

454
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,960
just simply based on technical merits and a project that people are interested in.

455
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:49,840
And that is really one of the most, I think, interesting sort of side meta stories about

456
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:57,600
you and Mycroft is how quickly you've become sort of a common technology that we are discussing

457
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,880
simply because it sounds fascinating on its technical merits and what kind of that says

458
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,800
about our community.

459
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:10,640
And I'm kind of wondering, Ryan, if you reflect on sort of some of – if you could

460
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,200
reflect for a moment on what that process has been like going from nobody knew your

461
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:21,560
name really and maybe I'm wrong on that but I certainly really didn't to now you're

462
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:26,400
making videos on YouTube about Mycroft, you're going to System76 and you're getting interviewed

463
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,920
on podcasts, you're having to make blog posts when you quit a job and tweet about

464
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,520
it and then all the follow up that comes from that.

465
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,480
What the hell has that been like for you?

466
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:44,480
So I have been into open source software for a long time.

467
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:53,040
And so I was always watching and seeing people who I thought were much more technically talented

468
00:24:53,040 --> 00:25:01,480
than I was shaping the conversations around the future of open source and kind of what

469
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,600
projects were rising to the top.

470
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:15,880
I think that the thing that happens is that after a while of being in this community,

471
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:23,080
you start to want to share your ideas and you start to want to contribute back to – I

472
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:28,120
had never used a server – I had never set up a server until somebody finally was like,

473
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:32,960
hey, check out Ubuntu in 2005 or whatever.

474
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,520
And when I started using the desktop Ubuntu, well then that opened my mind up to Linux

475
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:43,560
and at the time I remember I wanted to host a website and people were saying like, oh

476
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:52,240
you have to use this version of Windows Server and I just was able to get acquainted with

477
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,520
all this technology because of open source and so since then you want to pay it forward

478
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:06,640
and I got the opportunity to do so by introducing lots of people to a new technology that is

479
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,720
going to shape the future of computing in a lot of big ways.

480
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:17,920
Now before then, I actually was in the Mumble Room a couple of times before Mycroft ever

481
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,920
came around.

482
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:23,200
I talked about Kansas Linux Fest.

483
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,280
I think when I spoke for myself though, I'm really kind of meaning in the broader – like

484
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,320
Ryan Sipes as a name is probably not something – I don't think there's probably as many

485
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,720
people that were talking about you before something very technically interesting came

486
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,480
along that you were involved with.

487
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,480
Right.

488
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,480
Yeah, exactly.

489
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:49,640
But now because of my experience at Mycroft, I am very happy to be able to use kind of

490
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:56,120
the microphone that's given me to share other projects that I think that the open source

491
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:00,740
community should be gathering around and should be aware of.

492
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:03,560
One of these things is machine learning.

493
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,560
Absolutely.

494
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,320
That's an enormous opportunity.

495
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:16,400
It's an enormous – it's an enormous just space that's going to blow up and we should

496
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,400
be able to take advantage of that.

497
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,400
We'll need something there.

498
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,960
And the proprietary people are there now and will continue to be there so we need to be

499
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,960
there too.

500
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,960
Yeah.

501
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:31,600
And there are projects like TensorFlow from Google and Cafe from Yahoo and a few others

502
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,600
–

503
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,600
You mean Verizon.

504
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,600
– that are open source.

505
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,600
Yeah, exactly.

506
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:46,960
But I'm really excited to kind of go forward from here and continue to help shape maybe

507
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:53,080
like open source AI and personal assistance.

508
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:57,920
After a lot of self-reflection, I just found that I might have a better opportunity to

509
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:03,880
do that on my own at this point.

510
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:11,060
There are other projects that I hint at getting involved in in my blog post and I would love

511
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:14,120
to come back and talk about them and share some things.

512
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:21,840
I think that one of them the community will be familiar with and it's just a project

513
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,960
that hasn't gotten a lot of play that I think is really important.

514
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,200
And then there are some other ones that I'd like to talk about and see if we can't get

515
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:35,800
some collaboration.

516
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,120
But yeah, it's been a crazy wild ride.

517
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:45,440
I met a lot of people who I considered to be celebrities including you, Chris.

518
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:52,680
And it was kind of crazy when I posted the blog post to get calls from people who a year

519
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:58,480
ago if you said that they were going to give me a call out of the blue, I would have told

520
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,840
you that's just not possible, it's not going to happen.

521
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:07,400
And so it's been a wild ride and it's not over.

522
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,760
I think that there's so much more that I can do for the open source community.

523
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,880
I think that there's so much more that we as a larger community, the Jupyter Broadcasting

524
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:21,800
community, the Linux community can do and I'm excited to be a part of that.

525
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,800
Absolutely.

526
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,160
Yeah and you are always welcome to come and contribute to the shows because I always love

527
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:29,680
hearing your take on stuff and I know you reflect on this stuff quite a bit and I've

528
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:33,280
always sort of enjoyed following what you do and I'll continue to do so.

529
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,080
So thanks for joining us, Ryan.

530
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,880
And thanks for having me on.

531
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,400
Maybe some of you guys can help explain this next story to me.

532
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,400
Wes, I'm looking at you.

533
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,920
I know you're in the middle of a challenge right now.

534
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:47,880
But this sounds like a bad thing and I want you to talk me off the ledge, okay?

535
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,960
Fake Linus Torvalds keys have been found in the wild and we need to knock it off with

536
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,900
the short IDs ASAP.

537
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:59,120
Apparently it's well known that PGP is vulnerable to short ID collisions and many experiments

538
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,480
have been done to demonstrate that.

539
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:07,760
But what I didn't know is that keys, fake keys, fake PGP or maybe GPG keys I guess,

540
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:16,240
have been found for Linus, for Greg KH and other kernel developers in the wild recently.

541
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,240
Holy shit!

542
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,300
This seems bad to me.

543
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,000
This seems like NSA Russia kind of hacking China bad.

544
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,800
Well, it's really more just –

545
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,800
Talk me down, Wes.

546
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,240
You really shouldn't be using these short keys.

547
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,360
A project called Evil 32 to try to demonstrate this.

548
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:36,200
They took the web of trust, the usual one that you'll use if you are using PGP keys.

549
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,200
Right.

550
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,200
Yeah.

551
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,200
Say that five times fast.

552
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,280
Then they computed all of these brute force, you know, using GPUs and it looks like some

553
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,840
people have been taking their publicly available files and uploading them to some of the key

554
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,160
servers and so then people looking for them have found these.

555
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,200
So it does sound bad.

556
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,580
It is bad but we also know that these are not equivalent – they do not provide the

557
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:00,880
kind of identification, the kind of security that we expect from them.

558
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,240
PGP, GPG keys, don't do with the short IDs.

559
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,520
Anybody else in the moment have any takes on the story because this is kind of one of

560
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:11,600
those thick ones that it seems like something we know but probably the issue would be there's

561
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,840
stuff out there already that is signed with these short keys.

562
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,840
Short IDs, I guess.

563
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,400
And I don't know if anybody else has insights in the Momba Room but that's our take on

564
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,400
it.

565
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,400
Yeah.

566
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,400
Go ahead.

567
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:33,320
So I don't think this actually is bad for the normal users of Linux but more on people

568
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:37,880
that maintain distros and if they don't check it well then it's bad.

569
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,240
Oh, good point.

570
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,280
That is exactly who needs to be paying attention to this story.

571
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,280
Well said, Mr. Z.

572
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,280
Well said.

573
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,280
Thank you.

574
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,280
That is a really good point.

575
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:55,280
I wanted to mention something that I think was well said and started a conversation that

576
00:31:55,280 --> 00:32:01,140
I think probably wasn't necessary but I wanted to give a shout out to Ninja Aaron who 23 hours

577
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:05,600
ago created a Linux action show subreddit post saying a quick comment about the ButterFs

578
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:11,680
coverage on the latest Linux action show and that's where we discussed the fact that the

579
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:16,680
official ButterFs project Twitter account recommended people use ZFS or ZFS.

580
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,680
That's pretty wild.

581
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:21,680
That was wild and our story was really about the reaction to that but you know he makes

582
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,800
a great point.

583
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:29,220
He says that ButterFs is definitely having its issues but he makes a couple of good use

584
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:36,440
case for ButterFs in this post and I guess I did want to mention like I'm not necessarily

585
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:41,920
opposed to the idea of people that want to use ButterFs on their laptop that has an SSD

586
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,920
drive.

587
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:48,940
I don't really think ButterFs is like the devil file system.

588
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:56,000
Really where I have an issue with the ButterFs advocacy, it really comes down to when people

589
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,040
try to advocate that it should be used in a business slash enterprise setting, however

590
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:04,200
you want to describe that.

591
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:10,720
I started in IT in the year 2000, about – well actually really – actually that's not

592
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,720
true.

593
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:17,520
1997 was when I actually officially got paid in IT when I was – I was at that time desktop

594
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,960
tech support.

595
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,920
But one of the things that I had to – there was – I had two challenges over my career

596
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:29,080
that were very much about data retention and then I had many challenges beyond that but

597
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:34,200
there were some that were very particular legally mandated, very, very, very carefully

598
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:41,620
audited use cases that I can't even really go into and in these scenarios, back then

599
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:48,000
we used very, very cutting edge file systems that were very risky, mostly because that

600
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,560
was all that was available at the time.

601
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:55,640
And so it's not that I'm also like some holier than thou soapboxer who says oh you

602
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,640
should never use ButterFs because you're a lunatic.

603
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:01,240
I mean I've been the guy that's been putting in a file system that's a little edgy in

604
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,240
production.

605
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,620
I have on a lot of my systems.

606
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:11,000
But there is sort of – I guess there is sort of this – it feels to me like there

607
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,480
is this failure to look within a bit to sort of self-analyze and say we've made a mistake

608
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,480
here.

609
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,840
And so I wanted to acknowledge that while I have been sort of anti-ButterFs in the last

610
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:24,140
few weeks as there's been more flaws, I also think there's many useful use cases

611
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:29,780
for it and I wanted to give a shout out to Mr. Ninja Aaron for kind of very well stating

612
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:34,960
that case and making me reflect on it a bit and go – I myself if I – actually for

613
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,400
this MacBook here, I would absolutely consider ButterFs on there.

614
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,440
You should have said that like two minutes ago.

615
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,440
No, it's fine.

616
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,440
What did you get?

617
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,040
You're getting the XT4 just because I figured you wouldn't mind if it was a safe and solid

618
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,040
choice.

619
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,040
I don't mind.

620
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,040
No.

621
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,040
So you're actually that far, huh?

622
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,360
So that means you got wireless working.

623
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,360
Oh yeah.

624
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,360
Ah.

625
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,320
Now that wireless fix – this is one of the interesting things though is that wireless

626
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,360
fix will not persist once you reboot into the main OS after it's been installed.

627
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,360
No.

628
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,960
But maybe I'll be smart enough to root into and install that preemptively.

629
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,960
Thank you for the reminder.

630
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,760
Damn it.

631
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,080
You know Wes, I'm actually pretty impressed that you got the Wi-Fi working without any

632
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,560
other connectivity.

633
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,120
So what did you do?

634
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,120
What did you do?

635
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:19,760
So this is going to be – the number one challenge is these MacBooks – any recent

636
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,160
MacBook doesn't have an Ethernet port.

637
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,680
And everybody that's going to be doing this is going to run into this problem where they're

638
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,560
not going to have Wi-Fi when they get in a live environment.

639
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,880
So what did you do to enable networking without having a connection?

640
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,280
Well I had conveniently – we're installing Antigros here and I had an Arch Linux little

641
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,560
laptop right here.

642
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:42,800
So I just ran make package, built the package, copied it on a USB drive, installed it, mod

643
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,720
probed the broad cam drivers and away we went.

644
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,720
Well played sir.

645
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,720
Which I was very pleased.

646
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,720
Everything worked perfectly.

647
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,720
Well played.

648
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,720
Network manager picked it right up.

649
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,000
We were on the network.

650
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Damn.

651
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,360
And also I'm impressed that you remembered the Wi-Fi password too because I didn't tell

652
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,120
you what that was and you still – good job.

653
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,640
Anybody have thoughts on ButterFS in the mumble room before we move on to just a quick shout

654
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,640
out I have?

655
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:07,320
I'll just say I'm excited for BcacheFS.

656
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,200
We'll see when that's actually usable but –

657
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,840
Is that a B-tree kind of like RAM based?

658
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,840
Yeah.

659
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,840
Yeah.

660
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,840
Okay.

661
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,840
All right.

662
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,840
Tease me a little bit.

663
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,840
Let's see.

664
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,840
There's actually a Patreon for it.

665
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,840
Are you serious?

666
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,840
I mean maybe throw it.

667
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,840
Wimpy why are you looking forward to it?

668
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,840
Let's throw it right there.

669
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,840
Oh my god.

670
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,840
Okay.

671
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,840
Maybe that'll explain it better than I could probably.

672
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:39,120
Well Bcache is something that I've used to accelerate spinning drives by putting a Bcache

673
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:48,040
partition on solid state to effectively create sort of a level two cache.

674
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,040
This is great.

675
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:54,000
And the authors behind Bcache realized that they were very close to actually having a

676
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,280
full lock file system.

677
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:01,920
So they're going the next step to implement it as a copy on write file system.

678
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,240
They only have 38 patrons.

679
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,920
I feel like maybe we could bump that up a little bit for them.

680
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:11,720
So it's going to be a copyright on write file system like ZFS or Butterfess.

681
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,240
They aim for good performance.

682
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:17,240
They say significantly better than existing copy on write file systems comparable to the

683
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,120
performance of Extended 4 or XFS.

684
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,120
Hello.

685
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,120
See we really need this.

686
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,120
We're just embarrassing ourselves.

687
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,120
Oh wow.

688
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:27,680
Metadata and data checks on multiple devices including replication and other types of RAID,

689
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,560
caching, compression, encryption, snapshots and scalable.

690
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,260
It's been tested up to 50 terabytes and will eventually scale higher.

691
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:40,200
We'll be working on stable with a small community of users.

692
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,640
This is super exciting.

693
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,360
And what I really like about it is and this is where I was trying to get to in the conversation

694
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:51,040
on Sunday but I think I went off track is Butterfess when you look at the model almost

695
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:57,240
seems like this funding model makes a lot of sense.

696
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:02,300
It's just they would need way more support because it really is a full time job.

697
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,800
It is a lot of work to do this properly.

698
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,200
But this is this is great.

699
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:12,280
So Bcash I'll put a link to the Patreon in the in the show notes so that could be really

700
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,280
cool.

701
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,280
I'll check it out more after the show.

702
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,840
Has anybody tried it out?

703
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,840
Just watching it?

704
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,840
I have not now.

705
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,840
Hmm.

706
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,840
Hmm.

707
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,840
Wimpy what would be your use?

708
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,840
I've not tried it.

709
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,840
But one day.

710
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,840
One day.

711
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,840
Yeah.

712
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:30,840
As a principal file system on laptops for example.

713
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,840
Yes.

714
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,400
Oh could you imagine something like that.

715
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,440
The features of that if we had OK so here's why it's a big deal.

716
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,200
Here's why we need to get this right.

717
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:46,040
So one of the things that true OS is that out that they're changing the name of true

718
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,040
OS.

719
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,040
Is that a is that an official thing.

720
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,720
I hope I didn't anyways.

721
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,720
Is that a thing.

722
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,320
This is BSD unplugged.

723
00:38:54,320 --> 00:39:01,320
So PC BSD has the Lumos desktop environment and they they've done a lot of work on their

724
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:07,000
file manager to integrate ZFS snapshots and backups and multiple versions into the file

725
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,720
manager and that is honestly the level that we need to get at with the Linux desktop.

726
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:18,280
And until we really kind of land on something until we really sort of solidify something

727
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,400
like this we're not going to have it integrated to the desktop level like that.

728
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,200
There's no way until it has mass adoption that's going to happen.

729
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,360
And definitely one of the advantages that the PC BSD guys has is if you're going to

730
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:33,240
go with it if you there they have one file system choice that supports all this stuff

731
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:38,200
and that's ZFS and they can plan for that and they can exactly and it's the same advantage

732
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:42,480
that once Apple gets off their ass and they finally get APFS working they'll do that and

733
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,040
they'll integrate into time machine.

734
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:48,760
And to be honest with you in some ways NTFS has been kicking our ass for a couple of years

735
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,760
with shadow copy.

736
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,760
I mean shadow volume copy has really saved my ass a couple of times when I was in IT

737
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:59,900
and I it's one of the reasons why I wanted to use ButterFS here on our server that runs

738
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:04,440
our VMs because it I mean it saved my ass a few times.

739
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:09,880
So there is one story I want to talk about before we go any further into the show because

740
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:14,160
last week I kind of offhandedly mentioned the Humble Bundle and was sort of like dismissive

741
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,680
with their only three games that supported Linux.

742
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:22,600
And then this week Humble Bundle 17 went live and all of the games all of the games in this

743
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,640
bundle support Linux so I just I wanted to follow up on that because I gave them kind

744
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,960
of a hard time last week and then they totally delivered this week with Humble Indie Bundle

745
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,960
17.

746
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,360
This is the Humble Indie Bundle and all the games freaking support Linux.

747
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,360
That is awesome.

748
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:40,280
Yeah if you pay more than ten dollars you get Nuclear Throne which is I think yeah I

749
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,040
think that's one of the games I wanted.

750
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,040
So we have a link.

751
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,280
Octodad nice always a classic.

752
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,680
I like that OMG Ubuntu has been writing about this too.

753
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,680
Yeah that's nice.

754
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,680
I think it is.

755
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,160
I like that they're posting more over there they kind of slow down for a while and it

756
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,120
seems like they've picked it back up and I think that's nice because it feels like there's

757
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,720
a lot going on these days.

758
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,680
It feels like things in some ways it's August and the news is slow but at the same time

759
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,960
there is a lot of really we're on the precipice of the interesting things really hitting us

760
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,920
and so that stuff is beginning to arrive and if you're watching closely like like that

761
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,440
terminal we talked about that there are things beginning to land.

762
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,480
It's like an incubation period right now and there's stuff happening it's kind of just

763
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,200
not visible and soon it'll be popping up.

764
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,160
And it feels like they're doing a decent job of percolating some of that stuff up and some

765
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:24,660
of the stuff like the GIMP theme or arc theme stuff like that it's also just kind of nice

766
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,940
as a daily driver it's nice to have that kind of stuff.

767
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:31,680
So hats off to Joey over there for seemingly picking it up recently and really doubling

768
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,480
down on content that I've been enjoying reading even as a non Ubuntu user I still find it

769
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,160
kind of interesting which is got to be kind of a challenge for a site called OMG Ubuntu

770
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,160
right.

771
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,760
Hey before we go any further I'll tell you about a challenge I have and that is every

772
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,520
time I need to do something it feels like I got to get a new computer well that's where

773
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:53,360
DigitalOcean came in I am able to spin up a server in less than a minute now and that

774
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:57,040
is a game changer for me when I want to try something out I spin up a droplet when I want

775
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,120
to put something in production I use a droplet and when I want something just for family

776
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,560
members I use a droplet.

777
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,840
DigitalOcean is simple cloud hosting dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way

778
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:10,000
for you to spin up your own server on their kick ass infrastructure they have SSDs throughout

779
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,240
the entire thing they got data centers all over the world they have multiple data centers

780
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:19,000
in multiple cities they have private networking amongst your servers in certain areas which

781
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,920
is a really cool feature and I'm just going to put this out there I have not actually

782
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,980
done this yet but I'm going to admit Alan has been teasing me you could do a little

783
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:30,660
free NAS thing on that back end now that they've got block storage you've got ZFS you could

784
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:36,640
also do Ubuntu 16.04 with a little ZFS action and then do the back end block storage or

785
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:42,160
you know what if you want to go crazy you could probably there's probably I mean it's

786
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,960
block storage you could use butter fs2 yes you could you really could it's kind of fun

787
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:51,160
because it's a it's SSD backed and you just attach it as you need it's on demand their

788
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:55,240
pricing starts at five dollars a month and if you use our promo code and this is kind

789
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:59,520
of nice if you use our promo code do unplugged you get a ten dollar credit and then you can

790
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,240
try it out two months for free they have a really nice interface they have a super sweet

791
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:07,360
API that tons of open source codes already been written around and I got to tell you

792
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:12,160
now I've been using it I don't know a year and a half I'm not sure how long I've been

793
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:17,120
using digital ocean but almost every week I've spent up a droplet at least for a little

794
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:21,680
bit try something out and then destroy it and on occasion I keep it in production and

795
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:25,880
I've been I've been really sort of changing the way I think about computing like when

796
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:30,440
we wanted to start streaming on demand to a certain certain outlets that prefer you

797
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:35,840
only stream when you are actually live it made sense to just take an existing configuration

798
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:39,320
and sort of improve upon it and spin up a new droplet on demand using their API and

799
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,600
then we just pay for it while we're using it it really is like it's like infrastructure

800
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:47,640
on demand and it's it feels like 2016 you combine that now with their great tutorials

801
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:51,420
and the huge community around it and the fact that not only do they run Linux on their entire

802
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:55,400
infrastructure but they back a lot of the projects that we talked about in some capacity

803
00:43:55,400 --> 00:44:01,840
or another and a lot of the folks that we talked to interact with digital ocean in a

804
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:07,920
way that I don't know if digital ocean really promotes properly because like there's been

805
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,120
projects that have come along them and been sort of desperate for hosting and digital

806
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:16,080
ocean has provided it to them for free and or worked out deals with it's not publicized

807
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,160
very widely and the other thing like when they decided to bring on core OS is one of

808
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:23,760
their distributions and and free BSD and those are just the two since they've been sponsors

809
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,000
that I've had like some information about and so I'm not sure what they did in the past

810
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,800
probably similar is they actually contact the upstream distribution and say we want

811
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,520
to work with you we don't we they don't just like go grab the ISO image and make it work

812
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,400
they're like we're gonna work with you on this let's get this going it's pretty cool

813
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,920
that's very cool so use our promo code do you unplugged and a big thank you to digital

814
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:46,400
ocean for sponsoring the program you know Chris if you didn't have a handy Arch Linux

815
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,800
laptop you could there are some scripts out there to convert your droplets to Linux you

816
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,000
could compile your you'd make do your make packages up there yeah that is something people

817
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,720
could look into because it's Paul I think it's mostly made possible because they're

818
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:04,280
kick-ass console yeah exactly so I want to talk about Debbie and today's its 23rd birthday

819
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:08,540
and maybe we could talk about the future of Debbie in a little bit I wanted to reflect

820
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:12,720
on something for a moment before we get any further this is from swampy over it does market

821
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:20,080
where a YouTube account it's a video of Linus at Deb comp 14 which was in Portland which

822
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:25,440
I think I think JB live stream to this I don't remember so I probably could have played from

823
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,920
my own clip archive but credit to swampy for that for this clip here I'll start with something

824
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:37,640
non-controversial no no I'm fine with controversial that's not usually my problem it's well known

825
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:41,400
around these parts that in 2007 you did an interview where you said that although you've

826
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:46,820
used many Linux distributions you had never used Debian because you found it difficult

827
00:45:46,820 --> 00:46:03,040
to install yes have you tried it since no that was quick so I'm sure it's gotten much

828
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:09,800
easier to install it to me a distribution is I'm sorry you may want to close your ears

829
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:15,680
now a distribution is not very interesting I wanted to be easy to install so that I can

830
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:22,160
just get on with my life right which is mostly the kernel the closest I got to installing

831
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:31,320
Debian was there was one machine I forget which one it was it may have been the MacBook

832
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:39,720
Air that actually had trouble installing something and and Debian the installer would boot but

833
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:44,320
then it didn't install there either and eventually I figured out what was the problem with that

834
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:49,760
machine but but by then it was too late if there's a way to break installing an operating

835
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,480
system I've found it multiple times and if there isn't one you already know if I found

836
00:46:53,480 --> 00:47:00,760
it and Debian last time super easy highly recommended trying maybe I should try I mean

837
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:08,160
one of the problems I have is I am not an MIS person I mean I may do kernels and people

838
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:13,360
think that that means that I'm technical but when it comes to actually maintaining machines

839
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:19,400
I am a complete disaster it makes me feel better right it's funny that he's like so

840
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:24,440
caught up making and well maintaining the kernel yeah you know the actually running

841
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:31,440
of the yeah not that interesting okay that's fine Debian is one of my first Linux eyes

842
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:36,840
it wasn't my first Linux eye but it was my mostly impressed it was the one I was most

843
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:40,400
impressed by and the one that saved the day for us the most when we first started using

844
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:46,040
Linux oh yeah and I so I don't know if it wasn't for Debian I don't know if if I would

845
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:49,280
be a Linux user today really yeah well maybe I mean it might have still happened but I

846
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:53,280
think it was definitely major seems to have been a rock-solid choice early on so that

847
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:58,280
kind of people could latch on to it yeah yeah so I boy I really I really am really thankful

848
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:04,040
to Debian because we had definitely tried it was old Red Hat it was way way before Fedora

849
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:08,000
it was way way long time ago like Red Hat four and five and we were trying some of this

850
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,840
stuff and when we were trying to do things like get the most current version of squid

851
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:16,560
and it's funny to even talk about Debian in the context and getting a more current version

852
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,120
but yeah literally our Red Hat distribution it shipped with a really ancient version of

853
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:25,120
squid and Debian with apt-get made squid setup and then the other thing that was really nice

854
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:30,400
about Debian is after after you installed a package via the internet which by the way

855
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:36,640
back in the 90s that was magic that was magic that was that was unbelievable and it also

856
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:41,960
still supported CDs which was great because we needed those and so to be able to install

857
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:46,040
squid but then the next thing after installing squid where it would bring up like an end

858
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:52,120
curses interface and ask me questions about what I want and and then to make it so easy

859
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:56,440
to do that and set up email server that and they setting up an email server on Debian

860
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:02,460
word nobody made it as easy and quick and then continued to keep it secure and up-to-date

861
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:06,440
like Debian did it was just you could rely on the fact that they were so slow and they

862
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,920
took so long to upgrade that you're gonna get a solid five years out of that machine

863
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,960
and and you with solid updates and probably longer and then when you did ask gonna run

864
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:18,080
and then when you did have to dist upgrade after five years or six years it was gonna

865
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:24,600
work and that was that was what that made Linux so a safe bet for me and it made it

866
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:30,200
it made it possible for us to fix major networking problems that we had so I I have a really

867
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:34,920
soft spot for Debian then obviously it's sort of the the proto distro that so many things

868
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:39,040
have so many things have come from and if you look at if you look at the success that

869
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:43,200
Ubuntu has had and the on the cloud and all of that and the fact that those origins come

870
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:47,600
from Debian it's really it's kind of incredible so I wanted to open up the mumble room and

871
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:53,680
say hey guys what are your thoughts on maybe where Debian as a project itself is gonna

872
00:49:53,680 --> 00:50:00,680
go in the future where where does this where does the next five ten maybe even twenty years

873
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:05,060
where does Debian go and I wanted to give the mumble room time to ping me in the chat

874
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:08,600
room with their you know who wants to ever go so West while we while we give them time

875
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:12,640
to let us know where they and it could be quick or long have you reflected on this at

876
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,360
all since you know you and I were kind of chatting about this do you think Debian is

877
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:19,920
gonna continue to be a dominant player in this space is it gonna continue to just be

878
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:25,080
sort of the the foundation what's the next few years look like for Debian in your mind

879
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:30,620
I'm kind of uncertain I've played with Debian 8 I've used it to run like free switch for

880
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:35,960
example where there's some good like ansible recipes and other things that are freely available

881
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:39,740
and I mean I find it a relatively pleasant environment they've got system D now it seems

882
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:43,800
like you know it's pretty standard they have a huge amount of software available the Debian

883
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:48,560
8 release is still very current the software there is you know good for most needs they've

884
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:53,480
got their own PPA system in the works in the works I have not played with that or tried

885
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:59,320
any of that but you know it's coming you know what I haven't looked at it's like it's like

886
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:04,520
snap D that kind of thing that would be interesting as well but it does seem like a good place

887
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:08,160
to run software but I don't know what I what I don't know and what I'm curious to hear

888
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:13,520
from everyone else is what's the what's the enthusiasm like are people looking for it

889
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:17,120
is it like when you're just looking to run the Linux for some reason does Debian leap

890
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:20,960
to your mind should it leap to your mind well you know I'm gonna I see so Ryan's tagged

891
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:24,780
me but first I'm actually gonna I'm gonna jump it over to wimpy just for a second because

892
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:29,000
I have an idea where I feel like Debian is gonna grow a lot in the next five years and

893
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,200
that's Raspbian at the Raspberry Pi and I'm wondering what wimpy thinks about that is

894
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:37,840
you know because that's also a super popular trajectory for Ubuntu Mate it seems like a

895
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:44,880
likely a likely continued area of success for Debian what are your thoughts wimpy I

896
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:53,480
I think that's a little bit awkward actually because Raspbian isn't really part of the

897
00:51:53,480 --> 00:52:01,280
Debian community and I think Raspbian would do well to more closely align itself with

898
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:09,600
Debian rather than sort of be an offshoot with its own repository sort of bolted on

899
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:17,200
top so this is not a Debian issue more a Raspbian issue I would definitely like to see Raspbian

900
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:22,760
become more closely aligned with Debian so maybe in the future there isn't a Raspbian

901
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:28,920
there is just a Debian and everything you need to power everything on the Pi is in Debian

902
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:37,900
proper rather than this sort of thing yeah and you know if you're absolutely right and

903
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:41,320
if I'm right that this is gonna be a continued area of success for Debian that is just gonna

904
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:46,480
get even more awkward that is really something that's a great point wimpy Ryan I want to

905
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:51,180
give you a chance to jump in what do you think do you think there's gonna be another distro

906
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:55,960
that will ever be surpassed as like the proto distro in this next few I mean this seems

907
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:01,600
to be a solid spot for Debian right now yeah I think that you're right I if I pull out

908
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:11,920
my crystal ball and I look at it though I think that we see we see like let's look at

909
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:18,940
Ubuntu for instance sure I right now everything's based on Debian I don't know how long that's

910
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:25,320
gonna last I think for the foreseeable future that's a for sure thing but the but I could

911
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:31,680
see them since they've gained so much prominence in in the cloud and and across you know when

912
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:36,420
you're deploying stuff there's so many people would just say yeah I deploy Ubuntu you know

913
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:40,840
and they don't even think twice they just use whatever configuration management tool

914
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:45,920
that they're gonna use on their cloud and just bang it's like spun up 20 machines yeah

915
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:50,720
all running a workload and what's crazy is you see more and more of those running you

916
00:53:50,720 --> 00:54:02,200
know Docker images and like it it makes me wonder how long is it until until the until

917
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:09,920
the Ubuntu guys say like hey they want to go a different direction than we do why don't

918
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:16,120
we finally begin to break our reliance on them will snap be the press the thing that

919
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:20,880
pushes it over the edge there perhaps interesting I think it's possible yeah sweet Lou as a

920
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:25,360
user you say you don't really see a big difference between Debian and Ubuntu so do you just sort

921
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:34,320
of default go Ubuntu yeah I've tried some Debian base some other Debian based OS's before

922
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:41,320
and to me they just really didn't seem all that much different other than not you know

923
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:53,440
a usable place to install stuff from you know besides one that begins with an S there I

924
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:58,400
would say I would say yeah from a user usability perspective that's absolutely the case mini

925
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:03,540
Mac you make the point that you kind of view Debian as a having a special role in the open

926
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:09,560
source community yeah I see the Debian devs or the technical committee as somehow the

927
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:16,440
moral authority hmm you remember the set of s discussion or adaptation of system D yeah

928
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:22,920
I mean the work of Debian developers has still some impact yeah absolutely yeah you know

929
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:27,760
geez mini Mac good point if we reflect on the system D discussion it really seems like

930
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:32,960
there was a massive change in the discussion she's that bad thing I know there was a there

931
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:39,360
was a big pivot when Debian when Debian decided to go system D and then when Debian did some

932
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:45,760
of the legal legwork to make ZFS possible you immediately saw Ubuntu able to jump on

933
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:52,080
that and those are two huge huge technology issues and social issues quote unquote in

934
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:58,760
the Linux community that Debian was sort of the deciding authority on it's a great point

935
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:04,040
what it what an interesting position for them to be in and and you know it also makes me

936
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:08,480
think a little bit reflect a little bit on Ian Murdock and makes me miss him a little

937
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:13,920
bit so there you go that is boy if if you want to play with something kind of neat and

938
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,160
by the way mom or you still have a few chance a few minutes left or a minute left to jump

939
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:20,720
in if you want but if you want to look at something kind of neat and the history of

940
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:25,840
the Debian project we have timeline debian net linked in the show notes and you can scroll

941
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:30,560
through this and look at some of the major activity in the Debian project over the years

942
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:36,400
major milestones like Deb camps and huge bugs that were like news stories and first alphas

943
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:40,480
and then of course the final beta really final releases and the betas and all that kind of

944
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,400
stuff and also things like the the bug squashing parties in Cambridge and you kind of get a

945
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:50,640
sense for the Debian project at a larger scale it's pretty neat and sees that you can also

946
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:55,080
get a sense that there's still plenty of 2016 left to be filled out on that map and plenty

947
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:59,000
of the future for Debian goes way back this is I don't know what tech they're using to

948
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:04,480
generate this does it say it's really neat though yeah it's this tiny font down there

949
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,840
I can't quite read it it's at the bottom you see how small that font is at the bottom of

950
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:13,940
the page dang but somewhere down there probably tells you what they're using so happy birthday

951
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:19,120
to Debian guys it's it's really cool we're really happy to have something like you around

952
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:29,240
for so long so hats off and we give the as the special winners award to you yeah that's

953
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:34,040
for Debian right there just for you guys all right so I want to get to the how the challenge

954
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:40,080
is going and the reasons why this challenge was actually concocted in the first damn place

955
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:43,400
and while you'll probably be hearing more about it pretty soon if I were a little bit

956
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:51,080
of a crystal ball rubber what what did you what did you say crystal ball rubber Linux

957
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:55,180
Academy comm slash unplug that's where you go to learn more about Linux Academy and support

958
00:57:55,180 --> 00:58:00,400
this show Linux Academy is a platform to learn the core fundamentals around Linux and then

959
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:06,860
the stack around although I built on top of it as your AWS open stack Docker Python that

960
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:10,680
all that stuff in that ecosystem that you hear about all the time that feels like our

961
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:14,700
big major nebulous topics that you're not really quite sure where you'd ever even get

962
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:19,480
started Linux Academy helps you put it in perspective and get it done Linux Academy

963
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:24,120
comm slash unplugged where you go to support this show try it out they'll put you in the

964
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:28,580
middle of a real world scenario so you walk away with experience they have instructor

965
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:32,920
mentoring when you need it they have customized learning plans that can adapt your availability

966
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:37,980
even when you're super ass busy and as somebody who owns his own business and as a father

967
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:43,400
of three children I can attest you can make Linux Academy work for you just get started

00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:48,820
at Linux Academy comm slash unplug check out their great community look at their downloadable

969
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:53,980
comprehensive study guide there's real value there participate in their note card system

970
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:59,940
which is actually a pretty great experiment you might call it and enjoy their virtual

971
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:03,880
labs which spin up on demand when you need them and give you SSH access with distributions

972
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:08,500
you've chosen ahead of time Linux Academy comm slash unplugged if you're gonna get into

973
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:13,500
the world of certs this is a great resource Linux Academy comm slash unplugged in a big

974
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:18,580
thank you Linux Academy for sponsoring the unplugged program looks Academy comm slash

975
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:25,500
unplugged okay Wes I heard you rebooting during that spot I heard you how's it going it's

976
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:29,360
installed now we're working on getting it to show up in the bootloader you have a preference

977
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:34,100
do you want refined do you not I don't know I don't know what's what's the difference

978
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:38,900
this is this is all new to me I mean you can get it to work with the native EFI bootloader

979
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:43,580
that seems good okay but you can also install refined which is kind of just a nice better

980
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:47,780
what would make it easier to get the Nvidia graphics working because that's that's part

981
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:51,060
of the question that's part of the question because I think that's like a kernel boot

982
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:55,100
parameter because otherwise I think it uses the Intel graphics by default I believe so

983
00:59:55,100 --> 01:00:01,020
I want to talk about why this is happening because this is some crazy bull crap I mean

984
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:08,100
I actually I will be in full disclosure I will be honest with you the number one question

985
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:12,580
we have ever gotten into the Linux action show and Linux unplugged and I am literally

986
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:19,320
talking since episode one over a decade ago of Linux action show the number one question

987
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:25,220
we have gotten is how do I get Linux working on a MacBook and we answer it from time to

988
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:30,260
time but we never really fully go into it and so we're it's one of these things that

989
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:34,140
we're simply sick and tired of getting the question asked and so we just don't address

990
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:41,380
it a lot and I was I was I've been using the entryware Apollo as my daily driver at

991
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:48,960
home pretty much since my review and absolutely loving it and it is light right the battery

992
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:54,100
lasts for hours it's it's it's small enough that I can carry it and just bring it to work

993
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:58,700
when I need it not have to worry about bringing the power adapter and it's it is a very nice

994
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:04,920
machine and I have all my stickers all over it with I just I really enjoy it but then

995
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:11,940
No Man's Sky came out and that damn game I can't help but love it and it requires open

996
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:19,700
GL 4.5 support and SSE 4 I think and basically dedicated graphics and that's where the MacBook

997
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:24,940
came in yeah and I connected with okay so I sort of visualize myself as an audience

998
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:29,180
member I've either bought a used MacBook I've inherited a MacBook or I'm sick and tired

999
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:34,700
of Mac OS and Apple is not getting around updating this thing no and one of the things

1000
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:38,180
that I know from previous testing experience is that Linux runs a hell of a lot faster

1001
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:43,900
on the MacBook than OS 10 does so the fact that this is a 2013 is going to feel it's

1002
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:47,500
going to feel I estimate under Linux probably going to feel like a brand new machine like

1003
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:51,420
it's probably gonna feel very fast I mean it's got the PCI SSD in there it's got dedicated

1004
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:58,180
said not about using f2FS or whatever yeah it's got dedicated Nvidia graphics it's it's

1005
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:03,140
got a it's got a wonderful retina screen on it it's it's a really it's a pretty nice laptop

1006
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:06,900
is a nice lap and people generally accept that the MacBook is built well so the question

1007
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:11,460
has always been how reasonable would Linux be on the MacBook because my intention is

1008
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:17,300
I know this sounds ridiculous is to then install wine and then install No Man's Sky I eventually

1009
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:22,120
I plan to also put OBS on there and do some broadcasting from because it does have a four

1010
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:27,340
core processor as well sure yeah that would work well yeah so that's where that was sort

1011
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:32,300
of the impetus for myself to want to try Linux on the MacBook and then that sort of sent

1012
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:35,940
us down the path of trying to figure out well what do you need to know before you put Linux

1013
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:38,220
on a MacBook and it definitely seems to be one of the things you have to get your head

1014
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:44,500
around is what model of MacBook do you have and this is somewhat not obvious since Apple

1015
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:50,180
just calls everything MacBook and if you have Mac OS on your system you can actually entertain

1016
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:53,660
this by going into the about back system and I have a screen I have a screenshot of this

1017
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:57,500
in the show notes you go in there and it'll tell you like it's a late model something

1018
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:03,820
something you Google MacBook Pro late model 2013 and it will tell you the specific like

1019
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:08,620
model number is like it's 11 comma 2 or something like that right West of my yes I believe so

1020
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:12,140
yeah and there's like other ones like older ones are like you know different so it's it's

1021
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:17,460
it's a major model number comma minor model revision and you find that you can find like

1022
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:21,260
arch wiki entries which for mine I've linked in the show notes that specifically tell you

1023
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:26,660
about the little kind of esoteric tweaks you have to make to make it work on your particular

1024
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:31,680
MacBook model and I as I look at this I think this could be a this could be a really great

1025
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:36,580
Linux box if if all of this works out so I'm kind of really interested to see where it

1026
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:41,100
goes I'll try the Thunderbolt out and then I can report back to the audience on on some

1027
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:46,100
of my adventures with it I also was kind of wondering I was kind of wanted to pick Wimpy's

1028
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:49,540
brain and ask him if he hears many people in the Ubuntu Mate community that are running

1029
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:53,380
it on the MacBooks because that also crossed my mind as a possible distro if we couldn't

1030
01:03:53,380 --> 01:04:02,340
get arch working yeah it does crop up from time to time mostly in discussions in the

1031
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:07,220
Ubuntu Mate community and if it's something that you're interested in doing then that

1032
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:14,700
is the place to first search because it's a discourse so you can find the right discussions

1033
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:20,980
easily and if your model hasn't been discussed then start a new thread and there are a few

1034
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:29,900
people in there that can assist you with that it doesn't come up a lot it comes up a bit

1035
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:36,420
but not not loads it's certainly not a major platform I'm seeing people use Ubuntu Mate

1036
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:41,020
on I good I don't know I just don't at this point I don't know if I feel like recommending

1037
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:46,460
it although maybe I'll feel differently after we try this I do see it as like it could so

1038
01:04:46,460 --> 01:04:54,060
a couple of things have changed recently first of all based on some of my reading the roadblocks

1039
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:58,980
of getting the wireless working the Broadcom wireless have been significantly reduced but

1040
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:03,660
the big change which is in the more recent kernels been around for a little while now

1041
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:09,860
but if you depends on your distro there is built-in kernel level support with the synaptics

1042
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:14,580
driver for the MacBook touchpad or trackpad or whatever you want to call it and that was

1043
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:18,380
something that used to be a sticking point on my particular model have you had to do

1044
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:21,820
anything to get the trackpad working or has it been working no it's just been working

1045
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:26,540
I mean it's not quite as nice as the default one but I've got scrolling I've been impressed

1046
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:33,380
the media keys have working even in live media what about the I can see the high dpc I support

1047
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:37,220
gnome working nicely really you can see the tiny text on the console boot up and then

1048
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:41,020
yeah once you've got to the login screen really did gnome just automatically go high

1049
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:47,980
dpi mode yeah no way really yeah at least in the integration now what about the keyboard

1050
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:54,360
backlight that's a great question is that working can you turn that on oh yeah and it

1051
01:05:54,360 --> 01:06:01,300
even has the like scrollable menu shut up really yeah wow that's actually pretty look

1052
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:05,340
at gnome like kicking ass on that thing yeah so are you in the ins are you in the live

1053
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:11,260
media right now are you in the installed meet ls well now I'm in the installed OS actually

1054
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:14,780
I have to review how how it actually got here I was just kind of troubleshooting that but

1055
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:21,700
I rebooted again and I expected it to go into Mac OS X but it went right into yours so this

1056
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:24,340
is really going to be nice to be able to play no man's sky at home if you get this working

1057
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:30,020
with pretty excited I did a after tech talk yesterday I did a let's play with I guess

1058
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:34,000
that's what I would I guess that's what the kids call it I did a let's play with my son

1059
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,840
Dylan who is a huge minecrafter and there's definitely minecraft elements in no man's

1060
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:43,940
sky and so it was a lot of fun you know he's seven years old so he gets to experience some

1061
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:47,700
of the stuff like kid does it's a lot of fun to experience it through a kid's eyes and

1062
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:50,460
I think I'm going to post the let's play if you guys want to see it for the patrons at

1063
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:54,620
patreon.com slash today yeah so before we get out of here anybody else have thoughts

1064
01:06:54,620 --> 01:07:00,260
about the Mac books or actually I know mr. to know they're in the mumble room wanted

1065
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:09,020
to also say give a little bit of love towards the Zen books are you still in there I think

1066
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:13,080
you had to know I think you laugh but he wanted to say if you're looking at Mac books you

1067
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:16,740
should consider the Zen books I think I probably summarized what he was going to say he had

1068
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:21,860
particular models in mind but okay he would say check out the Zen books so do you want

1069
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:24,420
to continue on and we'll and then we'll just wrap up the show then we can cover in the

1070
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:30,440
post-show how that sounds great okay all right so that brings 158 to a close Ryan thanks

1071
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:34,020
a bunch for coming and man you are welcome to join us any week you have time is we're

and thanks for having me on Chris I love it you bet man and why don't you link that in

1076
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:54,780
the IRC so that way I can easily throw it in the show notes too so that way people can

1077
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:59,580
lazy web that and sure they don't have to worry about spelling all right that brings

1078
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:05,900
us to the end of this week's unplugged I tell you what Wes I'm damn impressed I think you

1079
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:12,900
have so far essentially completed every damn ridiculous challenge I've thrown at you during

1080
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:17,020
the show almost anyway coming close well I mean this is pretty much in there I think

1081
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:22,620
the dedicated graphics is within your reach man hopefully I am okay all right if you'd

1082
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:26,460
like to show up live it's a lot of fun join us over at jblive.tv go to Jupiterbroadcasting.com

1085
01:08:34,620 --> 01:09:01,780
see you right back here next Tuesday.

1086
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:27,980
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

1087
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:33,100
All right JBtitles.com thank you everybody it was a fun show I really enjoyed that and

1088
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:38,820
also sincerely happy birthday to Debian I really appreciate Debian I mean it's not only

1089
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:43,460
has it been the basis of some of my most enjoyed and used OS's and continues to be the basis

1090
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:48,180
for my favorite server platform Ubuntu but also I think it really was a big part of why

1091
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:53,340
I got into Linux so thank you thank you Ubuntu thank you mumble room thank you chat room

1092
01:09:53,340 --> 01:10:00,460
now let's go boat all right so where you at with that thing I've got it booting I'm making

1093
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:08,740
sure the bootloader is actually working and getting the Wi-Fi back up nice all right let's

1094
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:15,700
see about that proprietary drivers JBtitles JBtitles so this is this is a MacBook with

1095
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:21,940
an Nvidia chip in it yes yeah I think it's a 750 I think or a 760 and is this a new

1096
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:27,860
computer or one no no it's a it's a it's one that I used back in like before I think even

1097
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:34,820
before I hired Rekai for editing and then once Rekai came on board he had 50m ok 750m

1098
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:39,540
he got the dedicated Mac and then this sort of became like every time I wanted to do a

1099
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:43,760
comprehensive video editing project this is my machine I would go to and still do to some

1100
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:48,100
degree but I've been transitioning to KDN live more and more so I've had this sitting

1101
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:53,620
around and it's a late 2013 model that I and I actually think with an old Mac book you

1102
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:57,620
have a better success rate with a slightly older model which is kind of bears out why

1103
01:10:57,620 --> 01:11:00,420
I think you'll probably see more of these showing up on eBay when the new model comes

1104
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:04,480
out because it's literally been too long and so they'll probably people throw their old

1105
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:09,500
models on eBay and you might have Linux users who want a particular build a quality of a

1106
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:15,980
machine grabbing these and snapping these up perhaps so this is a pro 15 or some description

1107
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:24,740
is it yes yeah it's a it's a late 2013 MacBook retina 15 inch with the 750m and the 1 terabyte

1108
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:33,900
SSD PCI SSD and 16 gigabytes of RAM and West did you decide on a bootloader well right

1109
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:38,340
yeah right now it's just using the built-in EFI so like when you hold down the option

1110
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:41,780
key or whatever it is the that's what I'm working on confirming interesting but we might

1111
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:49,140
just install refined yeah look at you look at you it would be interesting to compare

1112
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:54,780
battery life between the systems no TLP installed and awesome that would really interest me

1113
01:11:54,780 --> 01:12:01,820
yeah I absolutely think this is not well optimized for the well I to be fair the cards are definitely

1114
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:07,780
stacked against Linux however I was reading the arch wiki and it appears that LM sensors

1115
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:13,780
now has some support but see I honestly the core issue I've never really been super compelled

1116
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:21,400
to do this is the way Max are built they are Intel machines absolutely but they use a completely

1117
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:27,100
different power management and cooling management architecture than a standard desktop PC and

1118
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:31,940
honestly if I were Apple I would too because a CPI and all of that is just total shit so

1119
01:12:31,940 --> 01:12:37,620
what Apple did is they created the SMC controller and the absence SMC controller is both hardware

1120
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:42,620
and software and the software component is only available in Mac OS 10 and there's no

1121
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:47,780
open source equivalent to it because Apple holds all of the information and the SMC controller

1122
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:55,140
is used by Mac OS 10 to escalate the fans with CPU usage so the OS is constantly monitoring

1123
01:12:55,140 --> 01:13:01,000
the demands and predicted demands the predicted demands if you can if you can even believe

1124
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:05,900
that of the OS workload based on your average workload and it preemptively throttles the

1125
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:11,020
thermal management of the Mac based on whatever metrics that Apple can has come up with with

1126
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:16,420
their black magic and there's just literally no way to translate that to Linux or Windows

1127
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:20,380
it's the same problem for boot camp users who decide to run Windows 7 to 10 on their

1128
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:27,580
Mac hardware they have the same exact issue and in the past what I had done is I got a

1129
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:33,820
program called SMC control and SMC control is a Mac OS program what you do is you can

1130
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:39,820
use SMC control to hard set your fans to a certain RPM so that way at least there's

1131
01:13:39,820 --> 01:13:44,620
some thermal cooling because otherwise what happens is without the SMC controller kicking

1132
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:51,220
in via software ignition then the thermal limits of the actual hardware are what did

1133
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:52,220
take the fan usage.

1134
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:53,220
Yeah that's what you want.

1135
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:57,740
No so when you actually get to the full thermal limits of the Intel i7 processor that's when

1136
01:13:57,740 --> 01:14:01,860
the fans cool when you get to the thermal limits of the GPU that's when the fans kick

1137
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:08,780
on so by using SMC controller in Mac OS 10 I could set the fans at a steady like 5500

1138
01:14:08,780 --> 01:14:13,700
RPM or 4000 RPM depending on my workload and then restart in the Linux.

1139
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:19,500
If you shut down then the SMC controller reset and so if I booted from a cold boot right

1140
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:25,140
into Linux I have no fan control but if I would first boot into Mac OS and then use

1141
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:29,740
SMC control which is a third-party utility that only supports most Macs and then use

1142
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:34,660
that to set the fan and then reboot from that into Linux I could have proper thermal management.

1143
01:14:34,660 --> 01:14:38,980
So one of the things that appears to have changed since I had to do that rigmarole was

1144
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:45,460
LM sensors appears to have some capacity to control the thermals on the MacBook now and

1145
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:50,620
so that could make a significant difference in battery life and it's absolutely an area

1146
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:54,620
I'm gonna test versus Mac OS whatever the current release is.

1147
01:14:54,620 --> 01:15:03,900
So I was just looking on eBay in the UK at that spec and they still sell used for around

1148
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:06,340
£1,200 which is about $1,500.

1149
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:07,900
Isn't it amazing?

1150
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:12,860
See I think Apple has always managed to have super good resale because they only at best

1151
01:15:12,860 --> 01:15:15,020
release a model a year it seems.

1152
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:22,380
So you just if it's on it's sort of it's sort of like there's by their by their apparent

1153
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:27,940
nonchalant attitude towards their hard Mac hardware customers they have created a very

1154
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:36,540
robust aftermarket value for the MacBook but a but every time a new one comes out everything

1155
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:38,160
shifts down a bracket.

1156
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:42,980
So that I believe this MacBook will probably shift down to about $800 once the new MacBook

1157
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:47,140
comes out in September and this a Core i7.

1158
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:50,540
Is that still a current model even though it's been around for a few years?

1159
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:55,580
No no no no but because but the current model will shift down a price range and because

1160
01:15:55,580 --> 01:15:59,260
this is a model or two below the current model it'll this is going to come down significantly

1161
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:01,300
to about $800.

1162
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:02,300
That's my estimation.

1163
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:05,260
I could be totally wrong but that seems to be the history is because this is like two

1164
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:09,460
models or three models behind this is going to be the this is going to be the real bottom

1165
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:17,460
basement like still get an i7 still get Thunderbolt still get Retina still get PCIe storage but

1166
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:21,820
under $1,000 easily will be this I believe that'll be the price of this machine and

1167
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:26,260
at that price range it almost becomes reasonable to experiment with Linux on it and just see

1168
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:30,480
well what the hell because I you know I it's a it's a six to eight hundred dollar MacBook

1169
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:33,620
depending on spec and at well at the end of the day if it doesn't work I could just do

1170
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:37,560
Mac OS 10 with Linux and VMware and so I think you're gonna have a lot of Linux users that

1171
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:42,420
will pick this thing up because they the cult of hardware worship around the MacBook they'll

1172
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:46,360
pick this thing up they'll try putting Linux on it and so I was like this is probably something

1173
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:48,460
that I'm gonna get a whole new wave of emails about.

1174
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:52,740
I'm kind of preemptively getting that yeah.

1175
01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:59,100
And you're only excited about Linux on Mac because the hardware is decent.

1176
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:04,820
Well mostly what it's come down to is I want to start doing more remote broadcasts and

1177
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:09,300
I need a pretty powerful system to run OBS because what I need to do is I need to bring

1178
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:13,580
in I need to bring in a couple of RTMP streams I need to send out an RTMP stream and I need

1179
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:20,600
to record so I'm probably gonna look at and so something that's for cores is probably

1180
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:27,200
going to be necessary soon for me on the go and the problem is is OBS is available for

1181
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:34,820
Mac OS 10 and if I'm not careful because of simple practical demand and need of production

1182
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:39,640
I might accidentally use OBS on Mac OS I have to be careful it's like it's like somebody

1183
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:43,740
who's an alcoholic I don't want to be around people that are I gotta I gotta make sure

1184
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:47,680
that if we have Linux on this thing I just continue to use Linux so it's sort of preemptively

1185
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:52,900
preparing for that it's also because I now want a Linux machine at home that has a dedicated

1186
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:57,740
graphics card and that's kind of the big driver for me personally is all my Linux machines

1187
01:17:57,740 --> 01:18:04,340
at home are Intel graphics and that's been fine but now that I want to play No Man's

1188
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:10,020
Sky at home it it's since I already have the hardware it's not like I'm buying the hardware

1189
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:13,980
if I if this was me buying it I would never do it but because I already have the hardware

1190
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:21,940
it seems like it's worth trying yeah definitely right and Linux does seem to run pretty damn

1191
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:27,980
fast on it like it's it's it's a it's interesting you know Apple's gotten a really bad rap for

1192
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:30,380
how long it's been since they've updated the Mac books and I've been one of the people

1193
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:37,060
giving a hard time but this is the 2013 it still feels pretty damn fast it's once you

1194
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:42,900
go SSDs and core i7 and all that it's a lot of but then it comes down to if you need things

1195
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:47,220
like quicksync or other or or you know would be nice as a is a is a nicer graphics card

1196
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:51,660
like a 980 or something yeah that would be nice yeah or even a 1080 yeah a 980 I'm in

1197
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:57,080
my new intro where oh oh yeah how is the best you have the Athena don't you how has that

1198
01:18:57,080 --> 01:19:03,540
been going for you you it's epic yeah yeah honestly wimpy if I had the money if that

1199
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:08,260
that would be my preferred route to go hands down absolutely see I feel like I can get

1200
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:13,060
in with I can get within a stone's throw distance of something like the Athena with the MacBook

1201
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:19,220
that I already own but I would yeah so are you running are you running a like a like

1202
01:19:19,220 --> 01:19:25,060
a like a like a multiple boot environment on this thing or is it just one distro I are

1203
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:30,300
you game tell me all about it oh you can probably guess the name um I would I bet I bet I could

1204
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:39,220
yeah yeah no it's just one destroyed yeah where's it's got it that's it yeah yeah no

1205
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:45,900
it's um one distro so one one uh root disk which is an NVMe uh drive nice and then I

1206
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:55,700
have uh two one terabyte um SSDs in there one is mounted as my home partition so just

1207
01:19:55,700 --> 01:20:01,780
for me and the other is mounted under a separate profile that I have just for Steam so when

1208
01:20:01,780 --> 01:20:07,300
I download the Steam games it goes to a separate disk and what that enables me to do is if

1209
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:15,860
I want to re you know play on the desktop or something like that I can just rsync that

1210
01:20:15,860 --> 01:20:20,220
partition to the home directory of the Steam profile everywhere else so I don't have to

1211
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:25,220
keep down because I'm on you know wireless internet that's a problem I have at home too

1212
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:29,540
that's a great idea yeah so you don't have to do it with a separate disk you just have

1213
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:35,140
a separate profile that you just use for Steam and then you know you can just rsync that

1214
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:41,020
to your Steam profile Steam accounts you know on your other machines sorry do you log out

1215
01:20:41,020 --> 01:20:45,900
when you want it when you want to game do you log out yeah yeah when I'm when I want to game

1216
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:50,780
I have a separate profile because I don't have any you know file sync services I have

1217
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:57,980
a very minimal desktop configuration I have the Compton manager going rather than com

1218
01:20:57,980 --> 01:21:02,380
peers or something like that so it's it's specifically I am going to play a game right

1219
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:05,780
now have you have you told with the idea I know you've probably seen there's tutorials

1220
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:10,780
to have like a separate big picture mode instance of x running or you can have login you can

1221
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:15,420
have user sessions that are only Steam big picture have you toyed with that idea yeah

1222
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:21,700
if I ever make a box to like go in the front room then I would do something like that but

1223
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:28,200
this is just on my machines I finished working I'm gonna play a game for half an hour log

1224
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:34,080
out log into Steam and it auto starts you know the Steam client it doesn't go to big

1225
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:38,640
picture automatically because you don't always want that but that's how I do it and it works

1226
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:42,620
very well for me and it prevents me having to keep downloading gigabytes and gigabytes

1227
01:21:42,620 --> 01:21:47,940
of stuff over and over and over again is clever I think I might try that I also heard in the

1228
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:54,020
Ubuntu podcast you're talking about it coming pretty handy at the snap sprint event yeah

1229
01:21:54,020 --> 01:21:59,620
yeah so I lugged it along so I took my Apollo and the Athena with me to the snappy sprint

1230
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:08,940
event two very different laptops two very different laptops and the reason why is because

1231
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:16,580
the power supply or rather the internal battery on the Athena is really a UPS that lasts long

1232
01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:24,160
enough for you to unplug the power in one location and walk to it's probably what two

1233
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:28,580
hours two and a half hours yeah it's about yeah it's about two hours yeah so it's not

1234
01:22:28,580 --> 01:22:33,540
that but you know when you compare it to the Apollo yes I I can comfortably get you know

1235
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:39,600
over seven hours I describe the Apollo battery life as I it's one of those laptops where

1236
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:44,340
I open up the I open up the laptop and I don't even consider when was the last time I had

1237
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:49,520
this on the power adapter that is such a feeling it's so nice yeah it makes it the perfect

1238
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:56,180
go-to really quick at home laptop yeah and the new the new Apollo you can now get with

1239
01:22:56,180 --> 01:23:04,460
16 gigs of RAM as well which is quite tasty yeah yeah so yeah I was using the Athena for

1240
01:23:04,460 --> 01:23:12,340
building snaps because you can now build use snapcraft to build your snaps in Lexd containers

1241
01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:18,420
so you can have multiple snaps building at the same time so consequently I was working

1242
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:23,220
on a snap start that building switch to a different workspace work on a different snap

1243
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:28,740
start that building and at one point I had seven or eight snaps building because that's

1244
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:36,420
great just had loads of loads of disk performance it's got 64 gigs of RAM it can do eight threads

1245
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:41,900
it was just belting through that would be the perfect that's the perfect OBS remote

1246
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:46,080
rig for me so down the road that might be where I go actually why while I'm picking

1247
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:52,220
your brain so I've been looking at pod publish and I have a secret project in the works that

1248
01:23:52,220 --> 01:23:59,260
I think I want to use pod publish for and I wondered how hard do you think I'm thinking

1249
01:23:59,260 --> 01:24:02,380
about enlisting somebody in the community to make some changes and I wanted to bounce

1250
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:07,620
it off you one of the things I would like to do is because I believe the pod publish

1251
01:24:07,620 --> 01:24:12,940
if I understand correctly one of the one of the files that it'll output is a like we've

1252
01:24:12,940 --> 01:24:17,580
talked about before is an MKV ready for YouTube that takes the audio track and then takes

1253
01:24:17,580 --> 01:24:22,500
a still image for that episode and repeats that still image that matches the length of

1254
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:28,860
the audio track right yeah that's right what kind of changes do you think it they could

1255
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:32,820
be major I don't know do you think it would take to make it possible to have it loop like

1256
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:37,980
an mp4 what do you mean by loop an mp4 have a video that is just repeated through the

1257
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:44,820
length of the thing yeah I imagine that'd be quite straightforward yeah that should

1258
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:50,140
be quite straightforward I love the idea of pod publish and it seems like should I tell

1259
01:24:50,140 --> 01:24:56,100
you the thing I wanted to do yeah using ffmpeg there is a I'm not sure if they're called

1260
01:24:56,100 --> 01:25:06,260
filters but there is a way to generate animations based on audio waveforms wanted to be yes

1261
01:25:06,260 --> 01:25:14,100
was actually just have it you know a spectrograph you know waveform of the audio for the duration

1262
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:19,180
of the I have been trying to solve this problem since I launched I mean I mean Rick I might

1263
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:24,100
know we have tried we have tried video editing plugins that will try with it try to generate

1264
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:29,940
this I have spent I have spent good money trying to solve this problem well I found

1265
01:25:29,940 --> 01:25:38,380
like half a dozen snippets of how to do this with ffmpeg and I couldn't achieve the exact

1266
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:43,560
result I wanted to achieve but I did find some reference stuff so if there's somebody

1267
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:48,220
out there who wants to have a go at solving that that would be kind of neat because what

1268
01:25:48,220 --> 01:25:51,740
you could do is have that overlaid on your still image you have your still image your

1269
01:25:51,740 --> 01:25:56,840
cover art yeah it superimposes all of the text for the you know the the episode and

1270
01:25:56,840 --> 01:26:03,740
title and all the rest of it and then you could have that you know spectrum going that

1271
01:26:03,740 --> 01:26:08,700
is so that is so badly what I want that I so badly wanted that I've given up on it and

1272
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:13,900
I just I just I just assumed I'd have to I'd have to compromise with a mp4 loop because

1273
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:20,100
that is the thing is is I YouTube is a viable publishing platform for a couple of reasons

1274
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:25,120
first of all it works for a lot of people to get around certain restrictions it's also

1275
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:30,060
has a huge built-in user base existing it's great for discovery just ask the chat room

1276
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:33,700
a lot of them are in there because they found us on YouTube once and then decided to become

1277
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:42,020
podcast listeners and then last but not least it may it is it is YouTube links are fundamentally

1278
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:47,620
just more shareable than an mp3 file with a certain time index in the mp3 file and so

1279
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:51,080
if you ever want to have your podcast shared with somebody else it kind of has to be up

1280
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:55,660
on YouTube so people can pass the link around but I don't want them just I don't want to

1281
01:26:55,660 --> 01:27:01,300
publish something on YouTube and have people stare at a still image right yeah yeah I agree

1282
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:07,860
so I would like to do the the audio is there's there could be several podcasts now that end

1283
01:27:07,860 --> 01:27:12,220
up using pod published from a snap and then if we make improvements to it like that it

1284
01:27:12,220 --> 01:27:17,060
could be some podcasts to get that I supply publish for those that don't know is is we've

1285
01:27:17,060 --> 01:27:20,860
talked about it just recently and I think last week show so check that out but it's

1286
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:25,380
a tool that is currently installable as a snap so I have it installed on arch actually

1287
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:29,620
a surprise surprise and you run it through there you give it you give it your podcast

1288
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:34,220
that you've done and it can output the files you need for people to download but also can

1289
01:27:34,220 --> 01:27:39,220
create the WordPress post and what nots like that and has a I and I file where you specify

1290
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:45,060
the different parameters and it then it it makes it very automated and for somebody who's

1291
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:49,940
very busy but has a couple of really fun podcast ideas up his sleeve it makes it feel more

1292
01:27:49,940 --> 01:27:55,220
approachable you know a lot of that's just taken care of for you yeah so I'm really excited

1293
01:27:55,220 --> 01:28:00,780
so I've got a fix coming to pod published in next couple of specifically the snap of

1294
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:05,260
pod publishing in the next couple of days I've had some feedback from running snaps

1295
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:11,820
on different distros where there's an issue with locales and it can get its pants in a

1296
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:17,060
twist so I've got a fix coming that will make that so after I install it from a snap it

1297
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:20,620
doesn't show up in my path does it until I log out and log back in is that is that is

1298
01:28:20,620 --> 01:28:24,980
that how it does it should show it should show up what's the command I run then because

1299
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:35,420
when I ran this is a implementation detail about snap yeah so if you have a snap for

1300
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:43,940
say ffmpeg and there's only one binary that you're exposing from that snap called ffmpeg

1301
01:28:43,940 --> 01:28:54,140
it goes half under slash snap lash bin ffmpeg pod publish has four executables in the snap

1302
01:28:54,140 --> 01:29:00,300
so consequently the namespace for the binary is pod published dot and then the name of

1303
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:06,900
the original executable so in your path you should have pod published dot publish underscore

1304
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:14,260
podcast for example and pod published dot encode underscore podcast and there's a couple

1305
01:29:14,260 --> 01:29:22,040
of others specific to upload oh one one was specific to when I uploaded everything to

1306
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:26,740
youtube for everything even to podcast had done which got us banned so that was the don't

1307
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:32,380
use that because you can ban yourself you uploaded you know 250 break your account script

1308
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:39,960
yeah yeah and there's another one that I forget what it does but the main to encode encode

1309
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:47,660
and then publish so with snaps it's pod published dot encode underscore podcast okay and then

1310
01:29:47,660 --> 01:29:54,820
just path to config file and in your config file you tell it where all of the paths to

1311
01:29:54,820 --> 01:30:02,780
your assets are and stuff I'll send you a snippet of I'll redact some bits of the Ubuntu

1312
01:30:02,780 --> 01:30:11,480
podcast okay any file because what we do is like nine tenths of the config file is just

1313
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:17,700
boilerplate yeah and we just have like six or seven things at the top of the file which

1314
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:26,860
are the episode number and the markdown for that episode I love it links and then it automatically

1315
01:30:26,860 --> 01:30:31,500
drops all of those necessary markers into the rest of the configuration for you so you

1316
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:39,260
don't have to do a full you know edit of a clean file every time you can start you know

1317
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:45,940
with a template and just change the few things at the top and it makes you know turning the

1318
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:51,540
publishing round very fast what I like recorded this evening Laura's already updated are any

1319
01:30:51,540 --> 01:30:56,820
files for our show notes so they're ready to go Mark's doing the edit this week which

1320
01:30:56,820 --> 01:31:04,700
he'll do tomorrow so we turn around the publishing very quickly now yeah wow well done and does

1321
01:31:04,700 --> 01:31:09,500
he edit an audacity because that's what I would that's what I'm I guess yeah we both

1322
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:16,140
do yeah so on the Ubuntu podcast org website there's a page called about the show and most

1323
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:21,820
of that page is actually how we produce the show and all the software we use including

1324
01:31:21,820 --> 01:31:29,060
the server stack and everything I encourage you to continue on pushing pod publish forward

1325
01:31:29,060 --> 01:31:35,580
because it's I haven't really been super interested in automating audio pub podcast

1326
01:31:35,580 --> 01:31:40,220
publishing for a long time and so I haven't really paid attention to it and Noah and I

1327
01:31:40,220 --> 01:31:46,460
and Rekai and West even get helped in a little bit recently have been really working on what

1328
01:31:46,460 --> 01:31:52,620
we are trying to create a way to bring video podcasting up to an entirely new level using

1329
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:57,600
Linux and open source and we don't it's not an automated system but it will be a technology

1330
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:04,900
stack that you use to create essentially super high quality I I think better than than anything

1331
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:10,160
I've ever seen before video produced podcasts even with remote hosts and whatnot and so

1332
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:14,480
I I like that you're sort of contributing at the audio end there which is still super

1333
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:18,900
obviously relevant and something I'm just kind of getting back into and at the same

1334
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:24,000
time we're kind of working on creating sort of a stack that people could deploy to also

1335
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:29,940
make podcasting video wise under Linux super straightforward really high quality so at

1336
01:32:29,940 --> 01:32:34,660
both ends of both audio and video we're sort of working on automating and creating

1337
01:32:34,660 --> 01:32:40,380
the best product under Linux and I think that's going to be really cool for media content

1338
01:32:40,380 --> 01:32:44,420
producers who want to look at Linux and we may one day have these tools available to

1339
01:32:44,420 --> 01:32:49,000
them that give it a edge up over some of the other desktops and we'll make them lead

1340
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:53,340
to proprietary OS's just to publish yeah because really if you can make it easy for

1341
01:32:53,340 --> 01:32:57,200
people to produce their content they'll go with whatever and if we can say this is

1342
01:32:57,200 --> 01:33:01,720
what you use on Linux to make your audio podcast or your video podcasting it you can make really

1343
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:06,420
nice reproducible episodes it automates the process for you it follows these standard

1344
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:12,440
conventions and this is this is I think something that the Mac has sort of gotten the default

1345
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:16,140
nod to for a long time and maybe maybe maybe we'll make a little bit of a difference

1346
01:33:16,140 --> 01:33:19,580
you know what didn't make it into my Nvidia shield TV review because it didn't even

1347
01:33:19,580 --> 01:33:24,620
cross my mind to try this until I was just in my Google dashboard recently and I was

1348
01:33:24,620 --> 01:33:30,140
you know in Google dashboard you can go back and you can play back all of your dictation

1349
01:33:30,140 --> 01:33:33,780
so whenever you dictate to the keyboard you it'll Google actually keeps a recording of

1350
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:36,980
that and you can play it back and it's kind of interesting because I play it back sometimes

1351
01:33:36,980 --> 01:33:39,780
and I hear my kids in the background and stuff like that it's like it's almost like a little

1352
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:44,540
time capsule up on Google a creepy little time capsule and so I decided to play back

1353
01:33:44,540 --> 01:33:50,260
some of the recordings from the Nvidia shield TV and the audio is super super bad oh really

1354
01:33:50,260 --> 01:33:54,100
and I didn't you know I didn't think that I didn't think about this in the review because

1355
01:33:54,100 --> 01:33:57,400
it just didn't seem like something to eat it's not something you've had to think about

1356
01:33:57,400 --> 01:34:01,220
before how good is the microphone so that way you can do voice dictation because that's

1357
01:34:01,220 --> 01:34:04,900
a key way you interact with the Nvidia shield TV like all YouTube searches it kind of says

1358
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:09,740
you know just hold this button down and talk to it and then it'll search and one of the

1359
01:34:09,740 --> 01:34:14,340
things I discovered and the reason why I realized there might be something going on is I noticed

1360
01:34:14,340 --> 01:34:19,380
that it started detecting Hadia's speech but not my so weird so I would give it to her

1361
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:22,620
she could search for things but I couldn't search for things hon will you search for

1362
01:34:22,620 --> 01:34:28,420
me again it'll get old it is it is it is very embarrassing actually because it's like I

1363
01:34:28,420 --> 01:34:32,140
sit there and I'll try like three or four times and I start saying it very I try to

1364
01:34:32,140 --> 01:34:35,940
enunciate very clearly and then I have to give it to her and she's just says at once

1365
01:34:35,940 --> 01:34:42,500
and then it's fine so you don't even exist I was a certain pitch let's see that was about

1366
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:45,300
I'm trying to figure out it doesn't tell me it doesn't really break it down by device

1367
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:51,660
which devices I was doing that's funny looking at some of the things I've said is kind of

1368
01:34:51,660 --> 01:34:56,980
funny but what I discovered what I discovered is that the audio is really really scratchy

1369
01:34:56,980 --> 01:35:01,180
from the Nvidia shield remote it just has a really crappy crappy that is unfortunate

1370
01:35:01,180 --> 01:35:08,060
yeah it's interesting for Google to have like you know an evaluation of just like evaluating

1371
01:35:08,060 --> 01:35:12,380
these as they come in and giving you like yeah these device has a nice little break

1372
01:35:12,380 --> 01:35:15,740
colored meter or something yeah yeah exactly exactly I was trying to see if I could find

1373
01:35:15,740 --> 01:35:21,100
an example for you this might be it yeah Android TV so let's see this is me saying starbound

1374
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:27,220
oh that's a dia having to say starbound because it wouldn't work for me she says it so well

1375
01:35:27,220 --> 01:35:38,480
yeah well as he came you could hear it wasn't very good but let's see sage brown it does

1376
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:53,100
sound like sage brown doesn't it round and here it says it got total chaos see how you

1377
01:35:53,100 --> 01:35:59,220
can't you can't understand me you can't understand what I'm saying at all if the microphone is

1378
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:10,340
just horrible and there you got THR roundtable and there because I think you hear it cut

1379
01:36:10,340 --> 01:36:20,660
out right there yeah yeah it's just so I and then here's me yeah I got that one clearly

1380
01:36:20,660 --> 01:36:26,260
okay Google yeah and that one's from my phone you hear much better that one is so that's

1381
01:36:26,260 --> 01:36:30,420
one thing I don't it's a it's a weird thing to amend to a review but I just kind of figured

1382
01:36:30,420 --> 01:36:35,740
out recently and either really it really depends on where you where you hold it too yeah and

1383
01:36:35,740 --> 01:36:39,540
okay yeah I was and I guess I also just revealed that I'm watching YouTube videos about starbound

1384
01:36:39,540 --> 01:36:44,260
I didn't I didn't mean for that all right I'm excited to announce that Wes is in the

1385
01:36:44,260 --> 01:36:49,960
market for a new switch that's right everyone I do networking switch at home and frames

1386
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:54,740
they need to go places it's important that they get there quickly what do you what is

1387
01:36:54,740 --> 01:37:00,580
in your requirement list for a new switch quiet how important is quiet not that important

1388
01:37:00,580 --> 01:37:04,660
it's going in the closet look at you with the dedicated networking closet I mean it's

1389
01:37:04,660 --> 01:37:08,540
also there's a lot of other things in that closet but I mean there's gonna be a switch

1390
01:37:08,540 --> 01:37:16,060
in there by dedicated I mean the closet that's right so managed yes I would like a managed

1391
01:37:16,060 --> 01:37:21,260
V lands and all that shenanigans I don't I don't have like a huge need of a crazy number

1392
01:37:21,260 --> 01:37:29,340
of ports but I would like it is your base base amount of ports probably 16 but I could

1393
01:37:29,340 --> 01:37:35,860
get away with eight if it was a nice and and we're talking 100 megabits good absolutely

1394
01:37:35,860 --> 01:37:41,220
not because I need gigabit my upstream is gigabit I need gigabit internally oh yeah

1395
01:37:41,220 --> 01:37:45,060
you do so yeah you do that's really why I'm doing it it's like before everything I had

1396
01:37:45,060 --> 01:37:49,820
your firewall has gigabit networking on it not my current edge device but I'm gonna replace

1397
01:37:49,820 --> 01:37:54,660
that with a tower I have set up I just got a new Intel dual port Nick that I put in which

1398
01:37:54,660 --> 01:37:59,220
I have not set up yet but just sitting there I can see it in LS PCI but I feel like this

1399
01:37:59,220 --> 01:38:02,580
is it we might have an episode topic in the making because you're gonna do what straight

1400
01:38:02,580 --> 01:38:06,820
up Linux right mm-hmm that's the intention I'm gonna try seeing out seeing how if I can

1401
01:38:06,820 --> 01:38:10,940
just do that and how it work Wow so maybe I'll regret it maybe I'll convert it to a

1402
01:38:10,940 --> 01:38:16,660
PF sense box I could always spin that up if you remind me before you go I have a I have

1403
01:38:16,660 --> 01:38:20,460
a switch you could take a look at that you might want to consider it's a silent gigabit

1404
01:38:20,460 --> 01:38:23,540
switch of course you don't care about noise too much but boy have I learned my lesson

1405
01:38:23,540 --> 01:38:27,940
on that one and it's worked really well here in the studio for us oh that's good yeah I

1406
01:38:27,940 --> 01:38:31,500
will have to look at that it's fanless too which is super nice yeah actually that might

1407
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:38,260
be what it is the anime the neck year GS 724 that might be exactly it in fact if somebody

1408
01:38:38,260 --> 01:38:43,160
would find that on Amazon and ping Angela with it that's she needs that too so also

1409
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:47,940
I love the HP switches so shout out to Sonic 7-eleven in the chat room for mentioning the

1410
01:38:47,940 --> 01:38:56,540
HP 1910 16g I some of the best switches in my there was a moment in my IT career where

1411
01:38:56,540 --> 01:39:01,180
before HP switches and then there was a moment after HP switches and I'm being dead serious

1412
01:39:01,180 --> 01:39:06,300
like it it was a game changer for me professionally because I constantly was battling with clients

1413
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:10,740
on the cost of switches they always wanted to lowball that particular component and HP

1414
01:39:10,740 --> 01:39:15,220
switches came along and offered a super competitive product like competitive with Cisco high-end

1415
01:39:15,220 --> 01:39:21,020
products for a much more reasonable price so what might be an $8,000 switch from Cisco

1416
01:39:21,020 --> 01:39:26,540
was a $3,000 switch from HP and now and that price scale has reduced even further now it's

1417
01:39:26,540 --> 01:39:30,840
it they make a good product so definitely love the HP's if you're if you're really looking

1418
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:36,660
I mean so just as an example right I think Angela has like an eight-year-old HP gigabit

1419
01:39:36,660 --> 01:39:45,700
switch 24 port fully managed it's been running non-stop for all damn near as long as I can

1420
01:39:45,700 --> 01:39:52,500
think of I mean no can't it's it's got to be yeah eight years old and damn near eight

1421
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:56,320
years old West and it's got to be one of the best switches to this day that I've ever owned

1422
01:39:56,320 --> 01:40:02,020
it's a really good one so big plug for HP switches but also I'll have to introduce you

1423
01:40:02,020 --> 01:40:07,580
to my switch that I have in the garage
