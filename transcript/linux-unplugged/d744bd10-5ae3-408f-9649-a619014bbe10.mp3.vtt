00:00.000 --> 00:01.800
Chris, have you heard the good news?

00:01.800 --> 00:05.140
KDE's working on modernizing Kate, their text editor.

00:05.140 --> 00:06.340
Oh yeah, I love Kate.

00:06.340 --> 00:07.180
It's great.

00:07.180 --> 00:09.260
So what does modernizing it mean though?

00:09.260 --> 00:10.580
What does a text editor need?

00:10.580 --> 00:14.400
Okay, well, they say they wanna make it more like Atom.

00:14.400 --> 00:17.320
Does that mean they're rewriting it in Electron?

00:17.320 --> 00:18.160
Let's hope not.

00:18.160 --> 00:30.160
Hello friends and welcome into Linux Unplugged 3.18. My name is Chris.

00:30.160 --> 00:31.000
My name is Wes.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.120
Hello, Wes. Big show.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.840
Huge show. Too big, maybe.

00:34.840 --> 00:37.140
I know, it's an oversized show. We got an oversized load.

00:37.140 --> 00:41.340
We're one of those podcasts going down the road right now and we have somebody ahead of us and behind of us saying,

00:41.340 --> 00:42.760
Hey, this podcast is too big.

00:42.760 --> 00:44.300
Wildly swerving all around.

00:44.300 --> 00:45.060
That's how it goes.

00:45.060 --> 00:45.560
Yeah.

00:45.560 --> 00:54.800
Well, coming up, we'll have some really interesting community news as well as Phil, one of the co-founders of Manjaro will be joining us to talk about their big announcement.

00:54.800 --> 01:02.640
They're going and really taking Manjaro to what would probably be described as an entirely new era for the distribution.

01:02.640 --> 01:04.640
It's a big deal, so he'll be on in just a little bit.

01:04.640 --> 01:14.720
We have a little bit of news we want to share ourselves this week and then something big is happening for Chromebooks that melts my brain a little bit.

01:14.720 --> 01:24.520
In the beta channel right now, on Chrome OS, you can choose between Debian, Ubuntu or Fedora for your Linux user land.

01:24.520 --> 01:27.100
And once you choose that, you get the full stack.

01:27.100 --> 01:32.980
You get the package manager, you can install applications, even graphical ones, they get added to the Chrome OS launcher.

01:32.980 --> 01:35.280
It's a full integration story, Wes.

01:35.280 --> 01:37.580
Can you say a year of the Linux desktop, anyone?

01:37.580 --> 01:43.540
So we thought, let's go back in time to the origination, the launch of Chrome OS.

01:43.540 --> 01:44.540
How it all began.

01:44.540 --> 01:48.720
And we'll cover that a little bit and then talk about this huge change.

01:48.720 --> 01:51.360
But before we get any further, we've got to say good morning to Cheesy.

01:51.360 --> 01:52.120
Hello, Cheese.

01:52.120 --> 01:54.120
Hello, Internet.

01:54.120 --> 01:54.620
How are you?

01:54.620 --> 01:55.120
Hello.

01:55.120 --> 01:56.000
Good, good.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.360
And time appropriate greetings to our virtual lug.

01:58.360 --> 01:59.560
Hello, Mumble Room.

01:59.560 --> 02:01.560
Happy Linux.

02:01.560 --> 02:03.060
Happy Linux Tuesday, everyone.

02:03.060 --> 02:04.760
Happy Linux Tuesday to you too, Jill.

02:04.760 --> 02:12.000
Hello to Brent and Bruce and Byte and Al and Jill and Lord Desk and Minimech and TechMav, Alt, so that he might have a goatee.

02:12.000 --> 02:18.180
And of course, Turf is in there too, and we start out with something pretty fun.

02:18.180 --> 02:25.380
We got a package that arrived in the studio this week, and I'm looking at that box, Wes, and I'm thinking that's something from System76.

02:25.380 --> 02:26.180
Sure looks like it.

02:26.180 --> 02:29.060
Do you want to do a live unboxing here on the show?

02:29.060 --> 02:31.260
I mean, I've been having to resist opening it up all day.

02:31.260 --> 02:33.000
All right, Wes Payne, let's do it.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.900
Come on now, get to that big box.

02:34.900 --> 02:40.100
Inside this, it looks like it's shaped like he's really going at it.

02:40.100 --> 02:40.900
You're really excited.

02:40.900 --> 02:42.100
There's no time to waste.

02:42.100 --> 02:43.900
He's been waiting for this.

02:43.900 --> 02:44.700
What are you seeing, Wes?

02:44.700 --> 02:49.440
Okay, well, their characteristic lovely interior box art, that's of course here.

02:49.440 --> 02:53.380
Oh, oh, they've got good instructions, and I see a beefy rig.

02:53.380 --> 02:54.120
Yeah, that's right.

02:54.120 --> 03:01.220
Ladies and gentlemen, in the box from System76 arriving in the studio is one of their Adder workstation laptops.

03:01.220 --> 03:06.060
It's well packaged in that there's a lot of plastic between me and it that I'm currently working on getting through.

03:06.060 --> 03:11.600
So what's neat about that is you can fold it such and that plastic gives, and it makes it really easy to do recycling too.

03:11.600 --> 03:17.600
So you can pull that cardboard out, you let the bottoms out, and it releases the plastic and the laptop slides right out.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.940
It's a really clever packaging system that they have.

03:19.940 --> 03:26.380
So the Adder workstation is a laptop that they say is really built for content creators, researchers, and gamers.

03:26.380 --> 03:27.980
It's a 15-inch large screen.

03:27.980 --> 03:33.180
It's got an RTX 2070 in it, an eight-core Intel i9 CPU.

03:33.180 --> 03:34.820
So we'll see what we got here.

03:34.820 --> 03:36.260
Oh, yeah, there you go.

03:36.260 --> 03:37.020
You got it out.

03:37.020 --> 03:38.260
It's free.

03:38.260 --> 03:39.560
What's the first impressions?

03:39.560 --> 03:42.800
It's thick, but it's not huge for something this massive.

03:42.800 --> 03:45.500
Yeah, it looks like some solid speakers right there underneath.

03:45.500 --> 03:47.300
That stands out.

03:47.300 --> 03:51.100
And you know, not as many ports as I might have expected.

03:51.100 --> 03:51.940
Well, check the back.

03:51.940 --> 03:55.140
One of the things they do is they put a lot of the big ports in the back,

03:55.140 --> 03:58.540
which I think that's an old tradition that should have never gone away.

03:58.540 --> 04:01.940
Power cord, HDMI port, it's all in the back.

04:01.940 --> 04:04.940
So your big cables are not side to side, and I really like that.

04:04.940 --> 04:08.460
Yeah, nice looking keyboard, good depth of travel on the keys, at least it feels like so far.

04:08.460 --> 04:09.780
Yeah, and that screen is looking good.

04:09.780 --> 04:13.060
So we'll give this the full kick of the tires.

04:13.060 --> 04:17.820
If you have any suggestions or questions about a workstation laptop like this, let us know.

04:17.820 --> 04:22.500
Tweet me at chrisles or go to linuxunplug.com slash contact and send your questions.

04:22.500 --> 04:29.380
And so we're sending that to the lab now to kick it off and see how it performs.

04:29.380 --> 04:30.780
What the hell is that?

04:30.780 --> 04:32.220
That's the sound from the lab.

04:32.220 --> 04:35.580
Is that a truck?

04:35.580 --> 04:36.660
We'll let that go.

04:36.660 --> 04:37.660
We'll let that pass.

04:37.660 --> 04:43.260
Are we planning to benchmark this through the test suite or something like that to kind of see where we're at on it?

04:43.260 --> 04:43.700
Oh, yes.

04:43.700 --> 04:48.420
One of the things I've done, Cheesy, is I've benchmarked, you know, the machines that have been in here over the years,

04:48.420 --> 04:50.620
but also all of our studio machines.

04:50.620 --> 04:51.540
So it's really cool.

04:51.540 --> 04:54.900
I can compare how systems that come in due to previous systems we reviewed,

04:54.900 --> 04:57.860
but also how they compare just to our existing boxes.

04:57.860 --> 05:03.060
So I can get an idea of like if we were to, say, replace a studio production machine with this piece of hardware,

05:03.060 --> 05:05.620
we could see this level of improvement.

05:05.620 --> 05:08.140
That's pretty fun because we have some monster systems in here.

05:08.140 --> 05:12.220
So it's always interesting to see where they'll sort of rate on the leaderboard, if you will.

05:12.220 --> 05:15.380
Now, what do you say we get into a little community news here, Wes Payne?

05:15.380 --> 05:16.300
It's about time.

05:16.300 --> 05:25.220
The one that I think a lot of people were surprised by in the community this week was Richard Stallman at the Microsoft Redmond campus giving a talk.

05:25.220 --> 05:32.940
Yes, Microsoft invited the free software legend, Richard Stallman, to speak at the Microsoft Research Headquarters this week.

05:32.940 --> 05:39.300
Microsoft Azure's Chief Technology Officer, Mark Razinovich, tweeted earlier this week, September 5th,

05:39.300 --> 05:45.660
that Richard Stallman visited the campus and gave a talk at the Microsoft Research Lab.

05:45.660 --> 05:50.500
Yeah, we've got a few inside details from someone at Microsoft.

05:50.500 --> 05:55.100
He basically said Stallman gave a standard talk, you know, covering the importance of free software.

05:55.100 --> 05:58.260
GPL version 3, GNU versus Linux.

05:58.260 --> 06:02.340
Although it sounds like he also had a list of what he called small requests.

06:02.340 --> 06:08.180
Make GitHub push users to use better software license hygiene, make hardware manufacturers publish their hardware specs,

06:08.180 --> 06:11.860
and last but not least, make it easier to work around secure boot.

06:11.860 --> 06:13.380
I like that one still on the list.

06:13.380 --> 06:14.780
Yeah, I think the rest of us forgot about it.

06:14.780 --> 06:16.660
Yeah, I did kind of move on.

06:16.660 --> 06:18.620
But RMS never forgets.

06:18.620 --> 06:21.780
He's like a dog with a bone on that kind of stuff.

06:21.780 --> 06:24.660
He really like, he'll follow a cause to the end.

06:24.660 --> 06:26.100
Get it out of here.

06:26.100 --> 06:33.100
Also in Microsoft news, the first Windows subsystem for Linux conference has been announced.

06:33.100 --> 06:35.220
That's how you know it's real.

06:35.220 --> 06:37.540
It's actually taking place right in our neck of the woods, Chris.

06:37.540 --> 06:43.940
It's going to be March 10th and 11th, 2020 at Building 20 on the Microsoft HQ in Redmond, Washington.

06:43.940 --> 06:48.940
Now, it's still coming together, but we already know it's going to have presentations from Penguin,

06:48.940 --> 06:54.740
Whitewater's Linux for Windows, of course, Microsoft's Windows subsystem for Linux team, and some folks from Canonical.

06:54.740 --> 06:56.180
Hmm.

06:56.180 --> 06:58.580
Guess what, too.

06:58.580 --> 07:00.260
Rumor has it Westpane's going to be there as well.

07:00.260 --> 07:00.860
I think I just went.

07:00.860 --> 07:01.700
As well as myself.

07:01.700 --> 07:07.340
Yeah, I've already talked with Hayden Barnes, the founder of Whitewater Foundry,

07:07.340 --> 07:10.780
and he's one of the individuals working on this, and he would love to have you guys there.

07:10.780 --> 07:12.300
And previous guests on the show.

07:12.300 --> 07:17.820
And it's just a run down the old freeway for us, really.

07:17.820 --> 07:21.260
It'll be interesting to see this sort of newer community of users take shape, right?

07:21.260 --> 07:23.140
I mean, this is all kind of out in the open.

07:23.140 --> 07:23.860
It's happening.

07:23.860 --> 07:27.020
A lot of it's based on an open source, but it's a new generation.

07:27.020 --> 07:33.260
Yeah, it was pretty surprising when I emailed their PR and I got a response back from Hayden himself, like, oh, well, OK, great.

07:33.260 --> 07:36.780
It's really cool to see this becoming super serious, too.

07:36.780 --> 07:41.220
I have a sense that it's no coincidence that Canonical's name is on that list.

07:41.220 --> 07:42.620
I think they're taking it more seriously, too.

07:42.620 --> 07:45.900
So we'll see where that goes in the future.

07:45.900 --> 07:50.740
But this week, there's one story I think that really got people's attention.

07:50.740 --> 07:54.260
Pretty big deal for a little Linux distro that could.

07:54.260 --> 08:01.060
It started out as an alternative to Arch, and now it's really developed into some favorite desktop Linux.

08:01.060 --> 08:05.540
Well, this week, Manjaro announced that they're taking the next step.

08:05.540 --> 08:06.460
Phil joins us.

08:06.460 --> 08:08.820
He is one of the co-founders of Manjaro.

08:08.820 --> 08:15.420
He was there when it was a hobby project, and now he's here to join us to talk about this big announcement.

08:15.420 --> 08:17.060
Phil, welcome back to the show.

08:17.060 --> 08:17.900
Hello.

08:17.900 --> 08:22.420
Hello, sir, and congratulations on the big announcement.

08:22.420 --> 08:30.900
Yes, it was pretty big and a lot of effort went into that and a lot of man hours as well.

08:30.900 --> 08:32.300
And finally, we're there.

08:32.300 --> 08:42.460
I imagine it takes many months of effort behind the scenes to get a company established, to make agreements with certain parties and work out details.

08:42.460 --> 08:45.060
This must have been an area of some focus.

08:45.060 --> 09:01.580
Sure, we had a lot of airplane tickets, hotel stays and business talks with several people over there, even with lawyers and accountants and whatever is needed to get a company started.

09:01.580 --> 09:03.140
So this has been in the works for a while.

09:03.140 --> 09:12.260
My first thoughts from the headlines of this is what we're getting out of this is some more full time free software developers.

09:12.260 --> 09:15.500
How many people are getting employed as part of this?

09:15.500 --> 09:18.340
Well, at the start, it's two people.

09:18.340 --> 09:23.940
One is Bernard Landauer, who is from Austria, and a second, it's me.

09:23.940 --> 09:32.420
So we are becoming the heads of the company, both acting as CEOs, and from then we will see who we employ.

09:32.420 --> 09:34.820
Now, a little little tease right now in the books.

09:34.820 --> 09:37.820
We plan to have Bernard on next week to follow up on another topic.

09:37.820 --> 09:43.140
But while we have you, Phil, I know Blue Systems is involved to some level.

09:43.140 --> 09:45.140
Can you share like what their involvement is?

09:45.140 --> 09:50.700
Well, they are our advisor and helped us to create a company.

09:50.700 --> 09:56.900
And as you know, Blue Systems is in all areas of open source and we are proud to have them on board.

09:56.900 --> 10:00.700
Yeah, they seem like they have taken on helping a lot of projects.

10:00.700 --> 10:03.020
And this is another great one on their list now.

10:03.020 --> 10:11.900
Also, I believe some aspects of the Linux Foundation are involved, like as far as donation transparencies and some of those tools, correct?

10:11.900 --> 10:16.740
Yes, it's thanks to Jonathan, who is one of our community leaders.

10:16.740 --> 10:21.940
He is gaining to secure all the donations we gained so far.

10:21.940 --> 10:30.700
So in the past, it's me who is taking the risk and the full responsibility for all the donations collected by the project.

10:30.700 --> 10:40.380
And now it's the perfect time to give that over to nonprofit organizations like Open Collective or the Linux Foundation, in this case, the Community Bridge.

10:40.380 --> 10:44.860
OK, so there's been some confusion in the early reporting around this.

10:44.860 --> 10:48.420
So I kind of want to make sure we get the details about this.

10:48.420 --> 10:50.060
So what is the story?

10:50.060 --> 10:55.380
Because there's, I think, confusion about where existing donations are going and these types of things.

10:55.380 --> 10:58.700
Well, in the past, it's on my personal bank account.

10:58.700 --> 11:03.580
So we couldn't give you tax deductions and such things.

11:03.580 --> 11:19.380
And the confusion might be because our company has a chipperish name like GIMBihar and Kokage, which is in UK terms LLP, if that is a thing which helps you out.

11:19.380 --> 11:26.660
And people think it's nonprofit, as Gartner and Lunduk says before on a YouTube channel.

11:26.660 --> 11:30.540
But we are a full spectrum profit company now.

11:30.540 --> 11:36.100
All right. And that's good to be clear about because, A, it's good to know what the donations go towards.

11:36.100 --> 11:40.380
But also, B, it means that in the future, it gives you avenues to explore.

11:40.380 --> 11:49.020
I mean, I'm just speculating, but other commercial ventures as well that are outside the core distribution itself, but perhaps hardware partnerships or other ventures, right?

11:49.020 --> 11:55.460
Right. So we are in talks with several other partnerships, also hardware vendors already,

11:55.460 --> 12:02.660
which will be exploring the ARM and the standard Intel AMD area as well.

12:02.660 --> 12:05.100
I'd love to know more about that when it gets closer.

12:05.100 --> 12:10.380
OK, so what happens to existing donations like, say, the Patreon right now?

12:10.380 --> 12:12.300
Where does that go away?

12:12.300 --> 12:14.220
Do they get directed towards the company?

12:14.220 --> 12:16.340
What happens in the future with that kind of stuff?

12:16.340 --> 12:18.180
Actually, I don't know of any patron.

12:18.180 --> 12:23.100
So if we have some patron, then some of the community has created that on their own.

12:23.100 --> 12:25.500
But it's not related to us. There is a page.

12:25.500 --> 12:27.500
Really? It's for the ARM community.

12:27.500 --> 12:29.180
All right. There's a managerial arm.

12:29.180 --> 12:30.460
They have it. They have it.

12:30.460 --> 12:31.620
It's a sister project.

12:31.620 --> 12:37.420
It's leaded by Dan, and Dan explored a lot of opportunities.

12:37.420 --> 12:41.300
And if Patreon is one of them, sure, go for them.

12:41.300 --> 12:45.300
I think they have also an open collective one beside us.

12:45.300 --> 12:49.940
So let's say they explored a little bit earlier what they can do.

12:49.940 --> 12:53.500
But in the end, the main project will support ARM as well.

12:53.500 --> 12:56.660
So, yeah, if we have a patron, then sure.

12:56.660 --> 12:58.820
That goes towards those efforts there individually.

12:58.820 --> 13:00.300
That makes sense. Right.

13:00.300 --> 13:04.580
So I guess I just kind of wanted to shift gears to a personal side of this.

13:04.580 --> 13:10.180
This this must be a huge moment for you to take something that's been a passion project

13:10.180 --> 13:17.620
and convert it to a legitimate business with transparency towards funding and be a full time job.

13:17.620 --> 13:21.740
And I just kind of wanted to get your your state of mind on all of this right now.

13:21.740 --> 13:28.740
Well, in the past, I was in sales, so I know all about how to get a business started and such.

13:28.740 --> 13:33.020
So I actually learned that. Past then, I went to I.T.

13:33.020 --> 13:41.140
I worked for big companies like BMW, Audi and other automotive companies in the past for several years.

13:41.140 --> 13:51.140
And the last was for public relations or the public industry, where it's like more slow down to relax a little bit.

13:51.140 --> 13:54.740
But my main project was always Manchara on site.

13:54.740 --> 14:03.900
And there was a point where I said, OK, is there a way to get it to main job or the main task as I do it anyway,

14:03.900 --> 14:10.340
to have more free time for other things? And with Blue Systems, we got that chance and we took it.

14:10.340 --> 14:15.060
Congratulations. I remember that moment when I was able to take my my passion,

14:15.060 --> 14:19.260
the thing I really worked on and push it over into the full time employment threshold.

14:19.260 --> 14:23.260
And it's a it's a big moment. And you realize that once you get your feet underneath you,

14:23.260 --> 14:25.300
there's a lot of opportunity that opens up.

14:25.300 --> 14:28.580
It could mean fascinating things for the future of the project.

14:28.580 --> 14:35.220
And I wonder if you think it also isn't a bit of a statement of the popularity of both the distribution,

14:35.220 --> 14:37.420
but also desktop Linux itself.

14:37.420 --> 14:43.940
Yeah, we are we are a community centric and that is always community first.

14:43.940 --> 14:47.100
And we want to keep that as that way.

14:47.100 --> 14:51.100
Sure, we have to make our decisions in the commercial part of the entity.

14:51.100 --> 14:54.580
But for the community itself, Manchara will always be free.

14:54.580 --> 15:00.500
We'll always gain the updates, as you know, and now we'll get more supportive.

15:00.500 --> 15:06.740
And if a company is interested in some business support, we are not able to do that.

15:06.740 --> 15:09.980
So it's a more win win situation for that.

15:09.980 --> 15:12.420
What a moment. What a what a great moment.

15:12.420 --> 15:16.060
And like I said earlier, it means more people working on free software.

15:16.060 --> 15:17.060
So that's great.

15:17.060 --> 15:19.100
It really solidifies the distribution, right?

15:19.100 --> 15:20.420
Yeah, Manchara is here to stay.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.300
Yeah, really, it's a it's a big moment.

15:22.300 --> 15:27.260
It's like a it's reaching another threshold of legitimacy in the distribution world.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.820
And I'm just really thrilled for you guys.

15:29.820 --> 15:36.380
And I think what we're going to do after this call is we're going to, for a week,

15:36.380 --> 15:38.580
try to get all of our work done on Manchara.

15:38.580 --> 15:39.980
You ready? Oh, yeah, let's do it.

15:39.980 --> 15:41.180
I mean, there's a USB right here.

15:41.180 --> 15:42.820
I'll just get a burn today.

15:42.820 --> 15:45.940
All right. So we'll report back in the next episode and see how it goes.

15:45.940 --> 15:48.460
You've in fact, you've inspired us with all of this, Phil.

15:48.460 --> 15:53.100
Yeah, it's always like we started an operating system.

15:53.100 --> 15:55.460
What was useful for us?

15:55.460 --> 16:02.340
More people come to the to the group and started to develop some tools like Pamac

16:02.340 --> 16:09.820
or the Manchara hardware tools and other tools which make the life of everyone

16:09.820 --> 16:11.980
using Linux in general easier.

16:11.980 --> 16:17.860
And our tools were always UI driven, so easy to use.

16:17.860 --> 16:23.740
And we see a lot of Windows user enjoying Linux and some of them coming to Manchara.

16:23.740 --> 16:25.420
So it's a plus.

16:25.420 --> 16:28.900
And we all see that also in the forum.

16:28.900 --> 16:32.620
So when we announced we are a company, we actually crashed it.

16:32.620 --> 16:36.980
So we are now currently working on getting a better server,

16:36.980 --> 16:42.780
more horsepower to compensate everybody's going to the beloved forum

16:42.780 --> 16:44.780
and gain their knowledge out of it.

16:44.780 --> 16:47.220
That must be a big part of the mission ahead, right?

16:47.220 --> 16:50.060
Is factoring in some infrastructure improvements over time.

16:50.060 --> 16:53.340
I think I saw you mentioned some of that in the announcement.

16:53.340 --> 16:58.620
Sure. One of the things we plan is more continuous integration.

16:58.620 --> 17:04.060
So all our ISOs we produce should be automatically tested,

17:04.060 --> 17:06.700
which gain also more quality itself.

17:06.700 --> 17:07.220
That's great.

17:07.220 --> 17:11.300
And we can produce them faster in a more related way.

17:11.300 --> 17:12.860
That is really great.

17:12.860 --> 17:17.780
I think this also reflects a great kind of common thing that happens in open source

17:17.780 --> 17:21.540
and a great kind of like, will it make it or will it not kind of make it story?

17:21.540 --> 17:25.460
A project starts out and you'll hear common myths come up about a project.

17:25.460 --> 17:27.980
Oh, it's it's just it's delayed arch.

17:27.980 --> 17:33.540
And then and it's like this is this really kind of sum the whole thing down to one variable

17:33.540 --> 17:35.540
and dismiss it kind of argument.

17:35.540 --> 17:38.340
And people people will just stick to that for a long time.

17:38.340 --> 17:40.660
But you guys stuck to it.

17:40.660 --> 17:43.500
You clearly had a vision and you followed it.

17:43.500 --> 17:47.700
You made you made choices like we recently had that conversation around free office

17:47.700 --> 17:50.340
that pushed the distribution forward in certain areas.

17:50.340 --> 17:53.740
And you make compromises when you feel like the community made a good point.

17:53.740 --> 17:59.420
And so by sticking to that vision, by making something that truly solve problems for people

17:59.420 --> 18:04.820
and by working with the community when they made a fair point and compromising,

18:04.820 --> 18:08.860
I think you've you've kind of come on something special and unique.

18:08.860 --> 18:12.100
And it's it's I think it's reflected in this as well.

18:12.100 --> 18:16.660
Well, Phil, again, congratulations and look forward to seeing where the project goes next.

18:16.660 --> 18:19.300
This is this is the beginning of a whole new era.

18:19.300 --> 18:22.660
Sure. And hope we'll talk to you soon.

18:22.660 --> 18:26.100
Now that we've chatted with Phil, I think next week we'll get a chance to chat with Bernard.

18:26.100 --> 18:27.100
Oh, looking forward to it.

18:27.100 --> 18:28.820
And we'll have Ran Mangiero.

18:28.820 --> 18:30.900
I'm going to try out some of the community edition stuff.

18:30.900 --> 18:33.420
I think it's going to be we sure do love making promises for ourselves.

18:33.420 --> 18:36.900
I know we like throwing we like throwing work at it like but at least it's fun.

18:36.900 --> 18:39.020
And it's been a while since I mean, I'm looking forward to it.

18:39.020 --> 18:41.220
Yeah, same. I'm really excited for them.

18:41.220 --> 18:43.500
You know, more people working on free software is always good.

18:43.500 --> 18:48.060
Absolutely. And, you know, in the past, we've kind of talked about how do you make, you know,

18:48.060 --> 18:49.380
these distros that we worry about?

18:49.380 --> 18:50.660
Do we have too many distributions?

18:50.660 --> 18:54.420
Are they just sort of small, independent people working on an operation?

18:54.420 --> 18:58.820
This is a big step, solidifying them, showing that Mangiero is serious about being around

18:58.820 --> 18:59.820
for a long time.

18:59.820 --> 19:04.420
Yeah, they'll be here for a while, which I think is probably the biggest takeaway from

19:04.420 --> 19:05.420
that story.

19:05.420 --> 19:06.420
All right.

19:06.420 --> 19:08.300
Well, let's make a little news ourselves.

19:08.300 --> 19:10.460
We like to do that every now and then.

19:10.460 --> 19:17.900
I am pretty excited to say time goes by really fast when you're having fun.

19:17.900 --> 19:22.820
This Thursday will be our one year anniversary with Linux Academy.

19:22.820 --> 19:26.140
Isn't that something?

19:26.140 --> 19:30.780
Does it feel like it's been that long?

19:30.780 --> 19:31.780
No, not really.

19:31.780 --> 19:36.260
I mean, it's a weird mix of it just happened and it's been this way forever and no idea

19:36.260 --> 19:37.740
how long it's been.

19:37.740 --> 19:38.740
Right.

19:38.740 --> 19:41.780
Which means it's been just over a bit of a year for Elle at Linux Academy.

19:41.780 --> 19:44.380
So happy birthday, belated birthday to you too Elle.

19:44.380 --> 19:45.740
Thank you very much.

19:45.740 --> 19:49.860
So we are celebrating with the launch of Self-Hosted.

19:49.860 --> 19:51.540
It's sort of a reverse birthday thing.

19:51.540 --> 19:52.540
We give you presents.

19:52.540 --> 19:54.540
That's how it works in the internet, man.

19:54.540 --> 19:56.500
That's definitely how it works.

19:56.500 --> 20:01.540
Self-Hosted launches episode one on Thursday the 12th.

20:01.540 --> 20:08.660
Self-Hosted has probably some of the most experience we've ever, as a team, we all went

20:08.660 --> 20:09.660
through a sprint.

20:09.660 --> 20:14.820
We've really thought a lot about this and it's been a really, really rewarding process

20:14.820 --> 20:22.580
and a huge shift for me because before this merger, a lot of times all of the creative

20:22.580 --> 20:25.180
decisions were unilaterally just made by me.

20:25.180 --> 20:26.180
Right.

20:26.180 --> 20:29.780
I mean, you're the guy running the whole thing.

20:29.780 --> 20:37.140
The idea of Tech Talk today from concept to launch happened in two hours on a Monday.

20:37.140 --> 20:39.020
Wow.

20:39.020 --> 20:42.700
On the drive to work, I got there and I was like, hey, Rekai, do you think we could do

20:42.700 --> 20:43.700
this?

20:43.700 --> 20:45.020
I was like, what if we did this?

20:45.020 --> 20:46.020
What if we did this?

20:46.020 --> 20:50.620
Then the next thing was like, hey, Enj, can you have somebody go get us some art?

20:50.620 --> 20:52.340
The whole thing just kind of just snowballs, right?

20:52.340 --> 20:57.140
But now we're much more deliberate because we want to measure twice and cut once.

20:57.140 --> 20:59.980
We know we're going to put a lot of effort into whatever we decide to make, right?

20:59.980 --> 21:00.980
We've got to get it right.

21:00.980 --> 21:03.140
It's a real commitment, right?

21:03.140 --> 21:06.500
Really Self-Hosted is our show where you can discover software and hardware to get the

21:06.500 --> 21:08.860
most out of the devices on your network.

21:08.860 --> 21:13.580
Control your smart devices, build things offline, take things that are available in the cloud

21:13.580 --> 21:16.660
and build them for yourself using open source software.

21:16.660 --> 21:20.220
But use the cloud, leverage it where it's appropriate, where it makes sense.

21:20.220 --> 21:23.820
Being able to integrate, use the abilities that are there, but make sure that you stay

21:23.820 --> 21:24.820
in control.

21:24.820 --> 21:25.820
Exactly.

21:25.820 --> 21:26.820
That's really the key of it.

21:26.820 --> 21:28.120
So I'm very excited about Self-Hosted.

21:28.120 --> 21:31.520
Episode one is this Thursday, it's Alex and myself.

21:31.520 --> 21:35.700
And then episode two, it's a twice a month podcast because we know there's a lot of shows

21:35.700 --> 21:36.740
out there.

21:36.740 --> 21:40.060
So we're trying to make really good shows and not overwhelm you.

21:40.060 --> 21:42.460
And there's always room for things to increase.

21:42.460 --> 21:45.820
But we wanted to make sure that we really got this right, gave ourselves time to work

21:45.820 --> 21:46.820
on it.

21:46.820 --> 21:52.940
So then episode two with Wendell from Level One Text comes out on Thursday the 24th, if

21:52.940 --> 21:53.940
I'm doing my date math right.

21:53.940 --> 21:54.940
I think you are.

21:54.940 --> 21:58.660
So it's every other Thursday, self-hosted.show slash subscribe.

21:58.660 --> 22:00.300
If you want to get it, it'll be out this Thursday.

22:00.300 --> 22:03.700
Oh man, launching a new show.

22:03.700 --> 22:05.100
There's really nothing like it.

22:05.100 --> 22:06.100
Good job, everybody.

22:06.100 --> 22:10.500
Now, what if we wanted to ask questions, say we had our own Self-Hosted questions and we

22:10.500 --> 22:13.780
wanted to direct them to you guys to possibly address on the show?

22:13.780 --> 22:14.780
How would we do that?

22:14.780 --> 22:15.780
Why cheesy?

22:15.780 --> 22:16.780
That's such a great question.

22:16.780 --> 22:22.140
You could tweet them at us with a hashtag ask SSH or a telegram and put that in there

22:22.140 --> 22:25.260
in the telegram message and we'll get in a future show.

22:25.260 --> 22:26.260
Awesome.

22:26.260 --> 22:27.260
So yeah, that's something we'll be doing.

22:27.260 --> 22:28.260
Thank you for bringing that up.

22:28.260 --> 22:31.860
Plus, there's also the contact page, self-hosted.show slash contact.

22:31.860 --> 22:35.020
But what if we wanted to launch two shows this week?

22:35.020 --> 22:36.020
No, that's crazy.

22:36.020 --> 22:37.020
That's crazy.

22:37.020 --> 22:38.020
Now we're going to do it.

22:38.020 --> 22:39.360
Actually, we've decided we're launching two shows.

22:39.360 --> 22:42.420
There's another show we're launching that we haven't told you about.

22:42.420 --> 22:44.340
It's actually already launched.

22:44.340 --> 22:46.940
Two episodes are out already as we record this.

22:46.940 --> 22:47.940
Look at this.

22:47.940 --> 22:48.940
Isn't this fun?

22:48.940 --> 22:49.940
LinuxHeadlines.show.

22:49.940 --> 22:50.940
LinuxHeadlines.show.

22:50.940 --> 22:58.820
Linux and open source headlines every weekday in under three minutes.

22:58.820 --> 22:59.820
How about that?

22:59.820 --> 23:00.820
That's it.

23:00.820 --> 23:01.820
That's the show.

23:01.820 --> 23:05.020
Ladies and gentlemen, very excited about the new project.

23:05.020 --> 23:08.640
I think I got to do an extras episode that tells the history of this.

23:08.640 --> 23:13.380
But this is something we have been trying to crack this formula since before the merger.

23:13.380 --> 23:14.380
Oh, yeah.

23:14.380 --> 23:15.380
A long time.

23:15.380 --> 23:18.940
It's something that Joe and I kicked around for a very, very long time.

23:18.940 --> 23:21.860
We've done internal pilots that we've canceled.

23:21.860 --> 23:25.340
But now we've decided to really go into this and really commit.

23:25.340 --> 23:27.300
So we're launching two new shows this week.

23:27.300 --> 23:32.580
Check out LinuxHeadlines.show every weekday, the headlines you care about in three minutes

23:32.580 --> 23:33.580
or less.

23:33.580 --> 23:37.740
It really is a testament to how much has changed and the great support from Linux Academy that

23:37.740 --> 23:40.820
we actually have the ability to do this and feel like we can get it right and launch two

23:40.820 --> 23:41.820
shows in a single week.

23:41.820 --> 23:43.460
Yeah, we have a whole team behind us.

23:43.460 --> 23:44.460
It really makes a difference.

23:44.460 --> 23:45.460
It really does.

23:45.460 --> 23:48.860
And the idea here is you can get just the headlines.

23:48.860 --> 23:51.580
You pop it on before you listen to a longer show.

23:51.580 --> 23:54.280
We're going to target it for an afternoon drive release.

23:54.280 --> 23:57.600
So we closely monitor the news.

23:57.600 --> 24:01.380
And then we have a process we go through to select which goes into the headlines and we'll

24:01.380 --> 24:04.580
try to get it out for your afternoon drive on the East Coast.

24:04.580 --> 24:05.820
How great.

24:05.820 --> 24:06.820
Are you excited?

24:06.820 --> 24:07.820
Are you busy at work all day?

24:07.820 --> 24:09.580
You just check in and go subscribe.

24:09.580 --> 24:10.580
Yeah.

24:10.580 --> 24:12.140
And we'll publish to the Smart Tubes as well.

24:12.140 --> 24:15.260
So you'll get it as part of your flash briefing if you like.

24:15.260 --> 24:16.900
That's all in the process right now.

24:16.900 --> 24:19.020
It works great in that capacity.

24:19.020 --> 24:22.060
And of course, we're putting everything we know to try to make it sound good.

24:22.060 --> 24:27.860
So it's a good sounding, clean, crisp, tight show with links for more information if you

24:27.860 --> 24:29.300
want to read it like we always do.

24:29.300 --> 24:30.300
Of course.

24:30.300 --> 24:34.480
You guys know we got a minimum standard we're going to meet and it's going to be great.

24:34.480 --> 24:38.580
So we are now in a position where we've got Linux Unplugged that covers the community

24:38.580 --> 24:39.580
stories.

24:39.580 --> 24:40.580
The ones we can really get something going about.

24:40.580 --> 24:41.580
Something we could chew on.

24:41.580 --> 24:42.580
A nice conversation.

24:42.580 --> 24:46.940
Then you got Linux Action News, which covers the stories in Linux and open source every

24:46.940 --> 24:51.380
week that really need analysis, that need further discussion.

24:51.380 --> 24:56.220
And that's five or six headlines that we've got further expansion and a lot of research.

24:56.220 --> 24:58.860
We generally have contacted people involved with the stories.

24:58.860 --> 24:59.860
Good analysis.

24:59.860 --> 25:02.320
Keeping you up with threads that happen over time.

25:02.320 --> 25:06.460
And then Headlines keeps you current on the daily updates in the Linux and open source

25:06.460 --> 25:07.460
world.

25:07.460 --> 25:08.460
Right there.

25:08.460 --> 25:13.860
And I just I feel like we've really come up with something great.

25:13.860 --> 25:16.900
We've boiled it down to the essential thing you need just to get in and get out.

25:16.900 --> 25:17.900
We're not wasting your time.

25:17.900 --> 25:18.900
Yeah.

25:18.900 --> 25:19.900
Not a bunch of fluff or anything.

25:19.900 --> 25:21.800
And we try to make sure, you know, we're human.

25:21.800 --> 25:22.800
So we're still learning.

25:22.800 --> 25:24.460
But we try to make sure we have something really good out of the gate.

25:24.460 --> 25:27.220
We've been practicing for a little bit and I think we got it.

25:27.220 --> 25:28.540
I think we do.

25:28.540 --> 25:32.220
Linux Headlines dot show slash subscribe to get that RSS feed.

25:32.220 --> 25:33.220
I am so thrilled.

25:33.220 --> 25:35.940
We've been trying to crack the daily show format for a long time.

25:35.940 --> 25:38.100
You know, there's a lot of different ways you can go.

25:38.100 --> 25:44.520
You can overdo it with campy music and and trying to like emulate radio and you can underdeliver

25:44.520 --> 25:48.940
by being too dry and too boring and you want to have some insights into what the audience

25:48.940 --> 25:50.660
is interested in.

25:50.660 --> 25:55.420
And so it's a big it's a big problem domain to solve and do it right.

25:55.420 --> 25:57.060
Linux Headlines dot show.

25:57.060 --> 25:58.260
Go check it out.

25:58.260 --> 25:59.260
Very proud.

25:59.260 --> 26:00.660
And self hosted dot show.

26:00.660 --> 26:02.620
First episode comes out on Thursday.

26:02.620 --> 26:03.880
Linux Headlines already publishing.

26:03.880 --> 26:05.860
We started publishing on Monday.

26:05.860 --> 26:08.820
So if you got six minutes, you can get all caught up.

26:08.820 --> 26:09.820
It's easy.

26:09.820 --> 26:10.820
It's easy.

26:10.820 --> 26:11.820
It's really great.

26:11.820 --> 26:12.820
It's and that's the great thing, too.

26:12.820 --> 26:15.820
It's like it's not impossible just to get on the ground floor on both these shows.

26:15.820 --> 26:17.400
Self Hosted is coming out twice a month.

26:17.400 --> 26:19.300
So that's not going to overwhelm you.

26:19.300 --> 26:21.100
And Linux Headlines is three minutes.

26:21.100 --> 26:26.380
So it's I appreciate that there's a lot to listen to this day these days.

26:26.380 --> 26:27.380
Right.

26:27.380 --> 26:28.380
We do.

26:28.380 --> 26:29.380
We do.

26:29.380 --> 26:30.380
We very much do.

26:30.380 --> 26:31.380
But we responded accordingly.

26:31.380 --> 26:33.980
We're trying to make something that's still consumable and worth your time.

26:33.980 --> 26:35.900
And of course, we'll have links in the show notes to it.

26:35.900 --> 26:39.300
Linux on plug dot com slash three eighteen.

26:39.300 --> 26:41.020
Big pat on the back for everybody.

26:41.020 --> 26:42.560
Everybody on the team.

26:42.560 --> 26:46.660
We've been really we've been whittling away at this problem.

26:46.660 --> 26:50.100
And sometimes, you know, like we had a few ideas that we really loved.

26:50.100 --> 26:54.180
We what we were like ready to publish really close and we had to say, no, it's not good

26:54.180 --> 26:55.180
enough.

26:55.180 --> 26:56.180
Just got to get it right.

26:56.180 --> 26:57.180
Pretty excited.

26:57.180 --> 27:00.540
Linux Headlines dot show and self hosted dot show.

27:00.540 --> 27:07.820
Now, before we get into our Chrome OS discussion and we haven't even mentioned the machine

27:07.820 --> 27:12.180
that we put this Frankenstein Chrome OS install on.

27:12.180 --> 27:13.180
Yeah, you're right.

27:13.180 --> 27:14.180
There's a certain.

27:14.180 --> 27:15.180
We'll have to get to that.

27:15.180 --> 27:16.180
But let's do a little housekeeping.

27:16.180 --> 27:17.740
There's some good things to cover here.

27:17.740 --> 27:18.900
First of all, new audio stream.

27:18.900 --> 27:21.540
We had some troubles with our JBLive dot FM.

27:21.540 --> 27:26.500
So if you want to tune into this year show live or any of our live shows, JBLive dot

27:26.500 --> 27:29.100
stream now, they'll take you right to the M3U file.

27:29.100 --> 27:30.100
Yeah.

27:30.100 --> 27:31.100
High quality, low latency.

27:31.100 --> 27:32.100
Boom.

27:32.100 --> 27:33.100
Right in your ears.

27:33.100 --> 27:34.100
I like it.

27:34.100 --> 27:38.140
You could be like the you should do like a slogan that we play on the live show.

27:38.140 --> 27:39.140
Yeah.

27:39.140 --> 27:40.140
Right.

27:40.140 --> 27:41.140
Each time it starts up.

27:41.140 --> 27:42.140
You're listening to JBLive dot stream.

27:42.140 --> 27:43.140
High quality, low latency.

27:43.140 --> 27:44.140
Right in your ears.

27:44.140 --> 27:45.140
Coming up.

27:45.140 --> 27:46.140
I kind of like that, dude.

27:46.140 --> 27:49.140
I think maybe you should do it there, Chris.

27:49.140 --> 27:53.820
Anyway, so we're trying to get the FM URL working because it's hard coded into some

27:53.820 --> 27:54.820
apps and stuff.

27:54.820 --> 27:59.900
So JBLive dot stream, pop that in your browser VLC and it'll play the audio stream for you.

27:59.900 --> 28:03.740
It's going 24 seven, but we do this show live on Tuesdays at 2 p.m.

28:03.740 --> 28:04.740
Pacific.

28:04.740 --> 28:08.460
So if you want to join us, JBLive dot stream and it's Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash

28:08.460 --> 28:12.180
calendar to get that converted in your time zone.

28:12.180 --> 28:17.000
Quick reminder, new courses in the month of September and details about those courses

28:17.000 --> 28:19.300
will have linked in the show notes.

28:19.300 --> 28:24.140
And another thing to keep on your radar, Texas Cyber Summit is coming up.

28:24.140 --> 28:27.500
It's coming up and there's the Be New track.

28:27.500 --> 28:30.200
What should we plug about Texas Cyber Summit this week, Elle?

28:30.200 --> 28:31.200
We're going to be there.

28:31.200 --> 28:32.200
That's worth mentioning.

28:32.200 --> 28:37.740
There is so much going on that it's hard to just kind of focus on one thing.

28:37.740 --> 28:41.300
But the one thing that I really want to announce is the fact that we're going to be doing some

28:41.300 --> 28:47.020
ticket giveaways for people to kind of stay tuned and come and join us and have a great

28:47.020 --> 28:49.580
time at the conference and the birthday party.

28:49.580 --> 28:50.580
Absolutely.

28:50.580 --> 28:51.580
The birthday party, too.

28:51.580 --> 28:52.580
Details about that.

28:52.580 --> 28:56.860
It's Jupiter broadcasting, Texas Cyber Summit, October 10th through the 12th at the Grand

28:56.860 --> 28:57.860
Hyatt.

28:57.860 --> 28:58.860
Should be a great time.

28:58.860 --> 28:59.860
It should be.

28:59.860 --> 29:00.860
It's been a little while since we've been to Texas.

29:00.860 --> 29:01.860
I know.

29:01.860 --> 29:02.860
We're missing it.

29:02.860 --> 29:05.860
You know, we're going to be going just as it starts getting real crappy here.

29:05.860 --> 29:06.860
So that's good timing.

29:06.860 --> 29:07.860
Escape.

29:07.860 --> 29:08.860
Yeah, that will be.

29:08.860 --> 29:10.740
Then we come back and it's like, even worse.

29:10.740 --> 29:11.740
Crap.

29:11.740 --> 29:12.740
That's true.

29:12.740 --> 29:14.640
There's also a Texas Cyber Summit telegram group.

29:14.640 --> 29:18.560
If you want to get on that business, we have that linked in the show notes as well.

29:18.560 --> 29:24.200
So get all of that Linux Unplugged dot com slash 318.

29:24.200 --> 29:26.180
That's everything for the housekeeping.

29:26.180 --> 29:34.520
Boy, Chrome OS really does seem like it's becoming the de facto desktop Linux, because

29:34.520 --> 29:41.700
if you go by definitions of years past to be a to be desktop Linux, quote unquote, we

29:41.700 --> 29:44.420
threw out a lot of definitions and there's a couple that really stuck.

29:44.420 --> 29:49.740
One, you should be able to go to like your big box consumer store and buy a laptop with

29:49.740 --> 29:50.900
it running on there.

29:50.900 --> 29:51.900
Right.

29:51.900 --> 29:52.900
Absolutely.

29:52.900 --> 29:53.900
Chrome OS meets that criteria.

29:53.900 --> 29:54.900
No doubt about it.

29:54.900 --> 30:00.300
But one that Wimpy threw out a while back in the past, episode two hundred and ninety

30:00.300 --> 30:06.340
six of this here show at thirty seven minutes into the show, Wimpy mentions that to be truly

30:06.340 --> 30:10.940
a desktop Linux operating system, you need to have the ability to download the source

30:10.940 --> 30:15.660
code of the kernel and compile it and install it and reboot and load it yourself.

30:15.660 --> 30:20.620
That we weren't so sure if Chrome OS was going to meet that particular criteria, but that

30:20.620 --> 30:23.100
may be up for some debate now.

30:23.100 --> 30:29.020
So before we go too far into this, I want to go back in time, if you will allow us,

30:29.020 --> 30:36.700
go way back in time to the Linux Action Show in 2011, Brian and I were covering a Google

30:36.700 --> 30:43.540
I.O. keynote, one of their early ones, and Chrome OS had been announced and we were trying

30:43.540 --> 30:46.100
to figure out what to make of this.

30:46.100 --> 30:47.100
All right.

30:47.100 --> 30:49.580
So here's the one that I think we'll touch on first is now Chrome OS, because that's

30:49.580 --> 30:50.580
that's Linux.

30:50.580 --> 30:51.580
That's a Linux machine.

30:51.580 --> 30:56.900
And so Chrome OS, I got a bit of a bit of a fanfare at Google I.O. and one of the things

30:56.900 --> 30:59.860
that I thought was interesting is was it Sergey, right?

30:59.860 --> 31:04.220
One of the Sergey Brin, the head dude now over there at Google, came out and said that

31:04.220 --> 31:08.420
one of the reasons they're launching Chrome OS is because standard desktop operating systems,

31:08.420 --> 31:13.420
Windows implied, standard desktop OSes are torturing users.

31:13.420 --> 31:15.000
Torturing users, Wes.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.860
That's what past Chris said, outstanding.

31:17.860 --> 31:19.380
That's a strong sell.

31:19.380 --> 31:23.180
And now when and keep in mind, when Chrome OS launched, it was a totally different thing.

31:23.180 --> 31:27.560
Now it's capable of running desktop applications from Linux.

31:27.560 --> 31:29.520
Chrome itself can do much more.

31:29.520 --> 31:32.040
The Web is much more capable.

31:32.040 --> 31:33.040
Connectivity is more common.

31:33.040 --> 31:41.020
In 2011, Wi-Fi was just simply not as prevalent as it is today in the States.

31:41.020 --> 31:46.660
Just about every kind of medium sized town will have some coffee shop with Wi-Fi.

31:46.660 --> 31:47.660
Right.

31:47.660 --> 31:51.860
I mean, the limitations have become less and Chrome OS has grown a lot of new abilities.

31:51.860 --> 31:52.860
Exactly.

31:52.860 --> 31:55.620
And Google has grown in influence.

31:55.620 --> 32:00.060
So it's been it's been something to watch Chrome OS over the years go from toy that

32:00.060 --> 32:02.580
we kind of mocked a little bit.

32:02.580 --> 32:05.420
When you watch that full episode, we're pretty harsh on it.

32:05.420 --> 32:10.820
We mock the 100 megabytes of data bandwidth allocation.

32:10.820 --> 32:13.120
We mock the lack of storage.

32:13.120 --> 32:16.580
We mock the idea that you'd ever use something in the Web when you're offline.

32:16.580 --> 32:18.980
Like, we really kind of have a go at it.

32:18.980 --> 32:23.360
And while I actually feel like the criticisms that are brought up in that 2011 episode are

32:23.360 --> 32:28.180
still valid today, it's clear it hasn't been a huge barrier for the market.

32:28.180 --> 32:29.180
Right.

32:29.180 --> 32:32.100
More of them keep getting made, getting sold and people are using them.

32:32.100 --> 32:38.380
And something that I don't think we fully appreciated in 2011 that we now in 2019 just

32:38.380 --> 32:42.420
have a foregone conclusion.

32:42.420 --> 32:44.640
Education.

32:44.640 --> 32:46.180
Education changed all of this.

32:46.180 --> 32:50.500
I had a conversation with my son because I knew we were going to be talking about this.

32:50.500 --> 32:53.300
He's been issued a Chromebook since the second grade.

32:53.300 --> 32:55.780
He had them in kindergarten, but they were just shared in the classroom.

32:55.780 --> 32:57.420
They would put them back in a storage unit.

32:57.420 --> 32:59.620
But since second grade, he's in fifth grade now.

32:59.620 --> 33:03.140
Since second grade, he's had his own assigned Chromebook.

33:03.140 --> 33:05.500
He has signed in with the same Google account.

33:05.500 --> 33:08.500
He has opted to change his password a couple of times, but I'm not even sure that's been

33:08.500 --> 33:09.900
necessary.

33:09.900 --> 33:14.020
Talking to him really, it made me realize that where you have institutions where they

33:14.020 --> 33:18.980
have scale and they have enterprise grade connectivity, at least close to it, those

33:18.980 --> 33:23.780
concerns about the cloud basically almost completely go away.

33:23.780 --> 33:29.660
Well, I mean, I can tell you personally that my wife uses Chromebooks in her classroom

33:29.660 --> 33:33.620
and they have what they call a Chromebook cart.

33:33.620 --> 33:37.700
So all the Chromebooks go back into the cart where they're charged up at the end of the

33:37.700 --> 33:38.700
day.

33:38.700 --> 33:43.180
The cart gets pushed against the wall or whatever, or it can be moved to different rooms.

33:43.180 --> 33:48.940
She so far loves Google's educational suite.

33:48.940 --> 33:56.660
Is it maybe kind of sort of possibly indoctrinating kids to use Chrome OS in the future?

33:56.660 --> 33:57.660
Maybe.

33:57.660 --> 34:00.500
Is that maybe a gateway for them to learn a little bit more about Linux?

34:00.500 --> 34:01.500
Possibly.

34:01.500 --> 34:06.060
So, I mean, I think that there's, you know, it's interesting how they've kind of beat

34:06.060 --> 34:10.940
some of the other players in that educational market and they're really, they just seem

34:10.940 --> 34:14.100
to be going crazy right now in that arena.

34:14.100 --> 34:19.100
My instinct on that about the indoctrination is it's a little bit of yes and no.

34:19.100 --> 34:23.640
I don't know about you guys, but when I was going to school, Apple was really pushing

34:23.640 --> 34:24.820
in education.

34:24.820 --> 34:26.980
Apple twos were really common in my school.

34:26.980 --> 34:32.540
And then later they were replaced by the Macintoshes, the sort of like the post Steve Jobs Macintosh

34:32.540 --> 34:34.000
monster machines.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.180
Our schools were filled with those.

34:35.180 --> 34:36.180
Did you guys have that?

34:36.180 --> 34:37.180
Absolutely.

34:37.180 --> 34:42.340
Yeah, I had Macs, but then those were supplanted when Microsoft got into the same game of pushing

34:42.340 --> 34:43.980
Windows PCs into schools everywhere.

34:43.980 --> 34:45.700
So I kind of switched halfway through.

34:45.700 --> 34:46.700
Yes.

34:46.700 --> 34:49.060
Yeah, I witnessed a little, I witnessed, that's a story for an extras one day.

34:49.060 --> 34:51.060
I witnessed quite a thing.

34:51.060 --> 34:52.500
But same sort of thing.

34:52.500 --> 34:53.500
It was a battle.

34:53.500 --> 34:58.460
There was a, and even later when I was still in school, but became part of the district

34:58.460 --> 35:05.580
IT department, as I did back then, there was a split internally in the IT department between

35:05.580 --> 35:06.700
Mac and Windows.

35:06.700 --> 35:10.540
There were the Mac technicians and they were a little arrogant.

35:10.540 --> 35:13.820
And then there was the Windows technician and they had contempt for the Mac guys.

35:13.820 --> 35:14.820
Of course.

35:14.820 --> 35:17.940
And it was really something because I was just sort of a universalist.

35:17.940 --> 35:20.840
I didn't really care, just liked technology.

35:20.840 --> 35:22.420
And that was what I was into.

35:22.420 --> 35:24.100
So I was like, you want me to fix a Mac?

35:24.100 --> 35:25.100
That's fine.

35:25.100 --> 35:26.100
You hadn't joined a gang yet.

35:26.100 --> 35:27.100
Really?

35:27.100 --> 35:28.100
You don't mind?

35:28.100 --> 35:29.100
No.

35:29.100 --> 35:30.100
But you fix the Windows computer.

35:30.100 --> 35:31.100
I'm like, yeah, that's fine.

35:31.100 --> 35:34.780
Of course, I eventually burned out on fixing the Windows computers.

35:34.780 --> 35:36.140
And now we've burned out on fixing Mac.

35:36.140 --> 35:37.140
So I just stick to Linux.

35:37.140 --> 35:38.140
It is interesting though, right?

35:38.140 --> 35:42.440
I mean, in some ways, education makes a lot of sense because you have fewer power users

35:42.440 --> 35:45.900
that have special applications that they need to run or support.

35:45.900 --> 35:50.020
And you have less sort of embedded other legacy applications existing.

35:50.020 --> 35:54.420
So at least for the students, you can have this sort of fresh idea and actually take

35:54.420 --> 35:55.420
hold.

35:55.420 --> 36:01.260
Well, and from the school district standpoint, you're not dealing with passing around files

36:01.260 --> 36:04.620
in a way that is likely to expose the school to malware.

36:04.620 --> 36:06.500
Yeah, it's a lot safer by default.

36:06.500 --> 36:07.500
Right?

36:07.500 --> 36:09.980
Students could take something home, they could get a USB drive infected, especially when

36:09.980 --> 36:10.980
everybody's on Windows.

36:10.980 --> 36:12.340
You know, everybody's heard this story.

36:12.340 --> 36:14.420
Bring it back to the school, school gets the virus.

36:14.420 --> 36:18.420
Now you got crypto encrypted, you know, files everywhere.

36:18.420 --> 36:23.520
Then additionally, the school district doesn't have to worry about centralized disk storage

36:23.520 --> 36:27.260
for all of the docs and the spreadsheets and the presentations because that's all online

36:27.260 --> 36:28.260
in Google Drive.

36:28.260 --> 36:33.260
And so that reduces their investment in server hardware and administration and overhead.

36:33.260 --> 36:35.100
So it's a great ongoing cost.

36:35.100 --> 36:36.360
Yeah, it's a great cost.

36:36.360 --> 36:37.360
It's a big cost for them.

36:37.360 --> 36:38.980
Sure, it's an ongoing cost, but it's great.

36:38.980 --> 36:42.620
It's fantastic because we don't have to do all these things.

36:42.620 --> 36:45.140
And at the end of the day, if a Chromebook breaks, it's on warranty.

36:45.140 --> 36:47.260
It's on a service contract and we just get it replaced.

36:47.260 --> 36:52.220
And we love it when these machines just get swapped out because they'll often just put

36:52.220 --> 36:53.220
the newer version in.

36:53.220 --> 36:54.300
It's great.

36:54.300 --> 36:55.540
It's a pretty good.

36:55.540 --> 37:00.260
And when you're dealing with students who are hard on computers, you don't need a big

37:00.260 --> 37:01.260
expensive machine.

37:01.260 --> 37:02.820
You want something, you know, light and flexible.

37:02.820 --> 37:07.700
Well, I mean, I'm curious as to, you know, because it's obvious that the Chromebook's

37:07.700 --> 37:11.380
cheaper than Apple's offering with the iPad.

37:11.380 --> 37:15.500
And if you're buying these in bulk for an entire district, you've got to be getting

37:15.500 --> 37:16.500
a great deal.

37:16.500 --> 37:20.700
And like you said, tag on the extra services.

37:20.700 --> 37:24.100
It's really kind of a no brainer, it seems like for education these days to gravitate

37:24.100 --> 37:25.100
that way.

37:25.100 --> 37:30.380
I also think back to the indoctrination point, there is some benefit in just learning the

37:30.380 --> 37:35.140
general concepts of like copy and paste and how spreadsheets work and how docs work and

37:35.140 --> 37:37.480
the concept of saving your files.

37:37.480 --> 37:42.580
Those are universal concepts that would apply just as equally to LibreOffice and Office

37:42.580 --> 37:43.740
365.

37:43.740 --> 37:47.180
So teaching the students those high level concepts that they can then apply to other

37:47.180 --> 37:49.380
UIs is useful.

37:49.380 --> 37:55.020
And I have to make this argument because I was the guy advocating to switch the school

37:55.020 --> 37:59.740
district to LibreOffice and the parents would come to me and they would say, you can't do

37:59.740 --> 38:00.740
that.

38:00.740 --> 38:03.340
Our kids are going to go use Office in the real world.

38:03.340 --> 38:05.860
And so they have to use Office in the schools.

38:05.860 --> 38:08.580
And my counter argument was, that's not true.

38:08.580 --> 38:13.220
By using LibreOffice, they will learn these fundamentals that they can apply to any software

38:13.220 --> 38:14.220
suite.

38:14.220 --> 38:15.920
Well, flip it around.

38:15.920 --> 38:18.800
Now something else has come in, those things are still true.

38:18.800 --> 38:22.200
And they're going to be interacting with other cloud services.

38:22.200 --> 38:26.060
They're certainly going to go to Google to actually search the web.

38:26.060 --> 38:29.380
So it's sort of inevitable.

38:29.380 --> 38:37.360
One thing I've noticed with my two older kids is it indoctrinates a web-first mentality.

38:37.360 --> 38:41.700
So Dylan had a little video project that he wanted to edit and a photo.

38:41.700 --> 38:45.020
I think you were here when he wanted to do the Pokemon photo thing.

38:45.020 --> 38:47.540
And he was really struggling using a desktop application.

38:47.540 --> 38:51.060
And then I realized, you know what I could do is I could open up Photopea in a web browser

38:51.060 --> 38:52.060
for him.

38:52.060 --> 38:53.060
He'll get this.

38:53.060 --> 38:54.780
And he just, it was like he was back at home.

38:54.780 --> 38:58.380
And I'm sitting there one time trying to show him Katie in live and he laughs at me.

38:58.380 --> 39:01.580
Oh dad, what are you doing?

39:01.580 --> 39:02.580
Just open up Chrome.

39:02.580 --> 39:03.660
What are you doing?

39:03.660 --> 39:07.340
And then of course, because this web one has like all of these like stock search stuff

39:07.340 --> 39:08.340
it can do.

39:08.340 --> 39:12.380
So like it can go get the green screen background for him and all of these things that are so

39:12.380 --> 39:15.020
much better when you have like infinite search and all this kind of stuff.

39:15.020 --> 39:22.780
And I felt like that was probably the biggest side effect of him spending so much time on

39:22.780 --> 39:28.340
Chrome OS is even now when he's on his elementary OS laptop, which is a Dell XPS.

39:28.340 --> 39:29.460
He's doing everything in Chrome.

39:29.460 --> 39:30.460
Right.

39:30.460 --> 39:34.460
But isn't that true of, you know, adults too now people who aren't into, you know, tinkering

39:34.460 --> 39:35.460
and playing with computers.

39:35.460 --> 39:39.440
I mean, most people open Facebook or play some maybe some games on the web.

39:39.440 --> 39:41.620
Check the news, send email.

39:41.620 --> 39:46.540
So if this is the common consumer use of Linux, like when you, when you look at all the school

39:46.540 --> 39:51.580
uses, when you look at average people that buy them, the fact that you can get them from

39:51.580 --> 39:55.000
a store, it's kind of Linux for the masses much like Android was.

39:55.000 --> 40:00.820
And now it's even easier because you, you loaded a project on a very ironic piece of

40:00.820 --> 40:01.820
hardware.

40:01.820 --> 40:04.660
So tell people about what this is and what machine we put it on.

40:04.660 --> 40:05.660
Yeah.

40:05.660 --> 40:06.660
Okay.

40:06.660 --> 40:11.500
So this is cloud ready, which is a distribution basically of Chrome OS or maybe, maybe Chromium,

40:11.500 --> 40:15.420
you know, they use the upstream sources for Chromium OS and then build and ship their

40:15.420 --> 40:16.420
own.

40:16.420 --> 40:19.880
Now we're using the free edition, but they also provide commercial editions that gets

40:19.880 --> 40:24.460
you their support and also integration with all of Google's enterprise management sort

40:24.460 --> 40:25.460
of features.

40:25.460 --> 40:26.620
Take that in for a second.

40:26.620 --> 40:32.300
So they are reselling a version of Chromium OS with their commercial support.

40:32.300 --> 40:38.060
And the, the appeal is you can essentially install it on any x86 machine.

40:38.060 --> 40:39.060
Yeah.

40:39.060 --> 40:41.940
I mean, it kind of worked just like any other Linux distribution.

40:41.940 --> 40:42.940
Downloaded the file.

40:42.940 --> 40:47.940
I used Etcher to write it to a flash drive, got here, booted it up on the Librem 15.

40:47.940 --> 40:49.000
The what?

40:49.000 --> 40:50.900
You know, the Librem 15.

40:50.900 --> 40:51.900
Turns out it makes a great Chromebook.

40:51.900 --> 40:52.900
Yeah, it does.

40:52.900 --> 40:53.900
Librem 15 really made it great.

40:53.900 --> 40:57.540
It took a little bit to get installed, but now it's, it's up and running and we even

40:57.540 --> 41:00.540
got the Linux application beta mode enabled.

41:00.540 --> 41:01.540
Yeah.

41:01.540 --> 41:04.840
Now that's, that is, oh wow.

41:04.840 --> 41:08.420
So this is something I'd really been wanting to try for a really long time.

41:08.420 --> 41:09.560
Two ways to get to it.

41:09.560 --> 41:14.660
If you just launch the search, like launcher and type in terminal and hit enter, it just

41:14.660 --> 41:18.140
brings up the screen and it says, Hey, do you want to set up a Linux environment?

41:18.140 --> 41:19.260
That's so handy.

41:19.260 --> 41:23.880
Or you just in the settings, you can go to Linux in beta, it has in parentheses and start

41:23.880 --> 41:29.660
and it loads a Debian 9 environment with the full app repository.

41:29.660 --> 41:31.100
You quickly installed dark table.

41:31.100 --> 41:32.100
Yeah, we got up.

41:32.100 --> 41:34.380
We could just edit photos like any Linux desktop.

41:34.380 --> 41:41.780
Chrome OS picks up the dot desktop file, creates a launcher entry for it, the appropriate dark

41:41.780 --> 41:46.620
table icon is right there in the Chrome launcher and you're running it.

41:46.620 --> 41:50.780
No like weird borders around the window or anything normal.

41:50.780 --> 41:54.300
And now the thing they're taking to the next level is they're letting you choose what distro

41:54.300 --> 42:03.500
you want in that environment or perhaps potentially even possibly all of them at once.

42:03.500 --> 42:04.500
Isn't that crazy?

42:04.500 --> 42:10.540
Uh, I mean like, am I supposed to be attracted to this?

42:10.540 --> 42:11.740
I don't know.

42:11.740 --> 42:13.460
Is this supposed to be something I'm attracted to?

42:13.460 --> 42:14.460
I can't tell anymore.

42:14.460 --> 42:18.740
Well, it is, um, you know, it's, it's kind of on the border lines now because before

42:18.740 --> 42:20.540
it was almost like an appliance, right?

42:20.540 --> 42:21.540
Mostly a black box.

42:21.540 --> 42:22.580
You weren't going to tweak it too much.

42:22.580 --> 42:23.820
You used it transactionally.

42:23.820 --> 42:24.820
You weren't invested.

42:24.820 --> 42:26.920
That was the entire point of the entire point.

42:26.920 --> 42:31.660
And now that's a little less true, but only as much as you want it, right?

42:31.660 --> 42:32.900
Cause you can blow this environment away.

42:32.900 --> 42:35.300
You can, all your stuff is still going to be saved to the cloud, right?

42:35.300 --> 42:38.220
You have to share folders into this Linux environment.

42:38.220 --> 42:40.020
You don't have to go down these rabbit holes, right?

42:40.020 --> 42:44.700
So maybe, you know, I think we've both gone through phases where you, your, your workstation

42:44.700 --> 42:49.980
can be both a workstation and sort of a toy, a hobby machine when you're not looking to

42:49.980 --> 42:50.980
do that.

42:50.980 --> 42:51.980
Right?

42:51.980 --> 42:53.060
This might, this might be perfect.

42:53.060 --> 42:54.060
You know, it's not going to break.

42:54.060 --> 42:57.580
You're not going to be able to do an app to get right before the show and have it not

42:57.580 --> 43:00.100
loading to show you the show notes, right?

43:00.100 --> 43:01.100
That's my favorite thing to do.

43:01.100 --> 43:06.020
But if you want to go install or try to play with some random Linux app, probably good.

43:06.020 --> 43:09.980
Or you know, you want to get this particular app from Debian and you want to get that particular

43:09.980 --> 43:12.940
app from Fedora and you can just pick and choose.

43:12.940 --> 43:16.100
I mean, it's also embracing a bunch of neat kernel features, right?

43:16.100 --> 43:18.460
With containers and such to make all this possible.

43:18.460 --> 43:19.460
So that's neat.

43:19.460 --> 43:20.460
Yeah.

43:20.460 --> 43:21.940
Both of us were like, yeah, performance seems just fine.

43:21.940 --> 43:24.980
Even with something like dark table, it just seems fine.

43:24.980 --> 43:30.900
It does see, feel like looking out Chrome OS, it's been probably since 2014, the last

43:30.900 --> 43:31.900
time I gave it a serious go.

43:31.900 --> 43:35.620
I think it was 2014 when we first got word of Crouton.

43:35.620 --> 43:37.740
I was like, all right, I'll give, I'll give it a try.

43:37.740 --> 43:40.820
Like every time something significant with Linux happens on the Chromebook, I'm like,

43:40.820 --> 43:42.940
all right, okay, I'll give it a try.

43:42.940 --> 43:45.580
So this time I was like, all right, I'll give it a try.

43:45.580 --> 43:48.980
And I go in there and I check it out and I'm like, it's way more complicated than it used

43:48.980 --> 43:49.980
to be.

43:49.980 --> 43:53.180
Like it's got a full desktop now with like a whole different launcher set up.

43:53.180 --> 43:56.180
Like if they've, they have complicated it up a little bit.

43:56.180 --> 43:58.180
I mean, it's even got some decent window management.

43:58.180 --> 44:00.620
We were splitting windows and dragging them around.

44:00.620 --> 44:03.100
And it was doing the thing where it'll pair the two windows and then you can just drag

44:03.100 --> 44:06.180
that one middle bar and it resizes both of them at the same time.

44:06.180 --> 44:07.180
I love that.

44:07.180 --> 44:09.180
I just think that's the best.

44:09.180 --> 44:10.460
I kind of liked it.

44:10.460 --> 44:11.460
Yeah.

44:11.460 --> 44:12.460
It wasn't, it wasn't bad.

44:12.460 --> 44:15.220
You know, I was thinking back, like, like when I was in college or similar times where

44:15.220 --> 44:18.380
I didn't have a lot of time to mess around, but I was still, I was using Linux at the

44:18.380 --> 44:19.380
time.

44:19.380 --> 44:20.380
This would be fine.

44:20.380 --> 44:22.400
You know, I was, I was doing stuff on other servers anyway.

44:22.400 --> 44:25.500
If I wanted a little terminal to play with something, it's there.

44:25.500 --> 44:32.060
That's why I like this project you found because it's a great way to like Chrome OS-ify a laptop

44:32.060 --> 44:34.580
that you might just like keep at the couch or something.

44:34.580 --> 44:38.180
I, I, for a little while, it was too nice of a machine to leave it like this, but for

44:38.180 --> 44:42.660
a little while we had the XPS 13 and we just took it and wedged it between a cushion and

44:42.660 --> 44:43.660
the couch.

44:43.660 --> 44:44.660
Oh, nice.

44:44.660 --> 44:46.620
It sounds really low tech, but it was perfect because you'd sit there and you're like,

44:46.620 --> 44:47.860
I just want to look something up real quick.

44:47.860 --> 44:52.580
And you'd just take out this tiny wedge of a computer, open it up and do a quick search.

44:52.580 --> 44:56.580
And I used it all the time and I kind of miss having that, but I just couldn't commit to

44:56.580 --> 44:57.860
putting something really nice.

44:57.860 --> 44:59.420
That just seems like such a waste.

44:59.420 --> 45:00.420
Right.

45:00.420 --> 45:03.740
But maybe a Chromebook or an old laptop with, with cloud ready on it.

45:03.740 --> 45:05.500
I mean, I'll give this cloud ready a go.

45:05.500 --> 45:08.020
The free version seems perfectly fine.

45:08.020 --> 45:12.620
And there's also other projects we'll have linked in the show notes that may take those

45:12.620 --> 45:16.780
types of installs and perhaps Chrome OS-ify them as the projects.

45:16.780 --> 45:17.780
Yeah.

45:17.780 --> 45:20.700
There's various, there's various little attempts at, you know, making this work to be a little

45:20.700 --> 45:21.700
more Linuxy.

45:21.700 --> 45:24.780
You know, I was a little off put at first when you have to, you know, you install it

45:24.780 --> 45:28.300
and of course you're prompted to log in with your, with your Google account, but, but that's

45:28.300 --> 45:30.240
what happens on other operating systems.

45:30.240 --> 45:33.340
And the nice part is you set it up, we set it up under your account and I wanted to go

45:33.340 --> 45:35.820
play with it and you were off working, working somewhere else.

45:35.820 --> 45:39.620
I just log in with my Google account and then suddenly it's, it's my Chromebook too, right?

45:39.620 --> 45:42.820
Like it has all my links, it's signed in, it's ready to go.

45:42.820 --> 45:47.440
And more importantly, we both had our own unique Linux environments.

45:47.440 --> 45:51.600
So I, whatever I'd done in my Linux environment, whatever I'd set up was not applicable to

45:51.600 --> 45:52.600
your account.

45:52.600 --> 45:53.600
Right.

45:53.600 --> 45:55.680
So you could go in there and set up your own environment and you didn't mess with mine.

45:55.680 --> 46:00.380
And I, that is super nice because you can't even do that on a, on a Linux box, right?

46:00.380 --> 46:01.380
Not by default.

46:01.380 --> 46:02.380
No, no.

46:02.380 --> 46:05.440
There is some potential there.

46:05.440 --> 46:10.920
It leaves me with this weird feeling because it's, it feels much like the Android situation

46:10.920 --> 46:15.920
where it's Linux, it's, it's Linux, but it's, it's re-imagined with some of the same base

46:15.920 --> 46:20.960
parts, but it's not what we would have felt in 2011 when it came out, my, my vision for

46:20.960 --> 46:27.420
Linux desktop for the masses involved some version of a desktop with gnome shell or plasma

46:27.420 --> 46:28.420
on it.

46:28.420 --> 46:35.720
That's always my, like that's my ideal desktop Linux is a mainstream free software desktop

46:35.720 --> 46:38.020
is what everybody's using.

46:38.020 --> 46:43.360
But the reality is, is Linux is a fundamental enabling technology that massive corporations

46:43.360 --> 46:46.640
that have the means are going to use to publish their own product, right?

46:46.640 --> 46:51.320
But they've got their own agendas, their own, their own designs on it, and they can use

46:51.320 --> 46:54.360
those technologies because of those licenses and shape it to be whatever they want.

46:54.360 --> 46:58.980
And it means that they don't have to invent how to do TCP IP and can instead focus on

46:58.980 --> 47:04.720
things like services and a decent desktop feature set and things like power management,

47:04.720 --> 47:08.920
power washing for restoring multi-user stuff, Linux environment containers.

47:08.920 --> 47:10.880
I mean, there's a clear advantage for them.

47:10.880 --> 47:17.640
And I, I guess I give Chrome OS more respect now after this than I did as a development

47:17.640 --> 47:18.640
workstation.

47:18.640 --> 47:22.640
I kind of thought that was sort of cute that they were trying to compete with WSL or, you

47:22.640 --> 47:26.440
know, like Docker and, you know, all the different things that we just recently talked about

47:26.440 --> 47:28.600
the code ready containers from Red Hat.

47:28.600 --> 47:33.120
That's another attempt at this, like all these different attempts to make development on

47:33.120 --> 47:35.120
the desktop match production.

47:35.120 --> 47:39.760
Like that's one of Ubuntu's strengths is you can deploy Ubuntu LTS on your laptop and you

47:39.760 --> 47:46.000
can develop on the same environment that you run in production.

47:46.000 --> 47:47.760
Google's trying to give you all the options.

47:47.760 --> 47:51.840
Hey, you got a Debian server in production, you got an Ubuntu server in production, just

47:51.840 --> 47:52.840
great.

47:52.840 --> 47:54.560
Just get Chrome OS.

47:54.560 --> 47:55.560
We'll play with that.

47:55.560 --> 47:56.560
It's pretty.

47:56.560 --> 47:57.560
And you're already using Chrome anyway.

47:57.560 --> 47:58.560
Yeah.

47:58.560 --> 47:59.560
They're getting it.

47:59.560 --> 48:00.560
Yeah.

48:00.560 --> 48:02.400
You're already all, you got a Gmail, you're using Docs and Drive.

48:02.400 --> 48:03.400
Listen.

48:03.400 --> 48:06.800
We're going to have to install Firefox on there after the show, you realize, right?

48:06.800 --> 48:08.120
Just, just to be fun.

48:08.120 --> 48:09.600
We totally should.

48:09.600 --> 48:10.720
We should do that.

48:10.720 --> 48:11.720
We should totally do that.

48:11.720 --> 48:15.800
Also, I just realized it'd be interesting to see what the battery life is like on that.

48:15.800 --> 48:18.600
Well, you know, we might just leave it around for a while and start, start using it a bit.

48:18.600 --> 48:24.480
It would almost, almost, if it didn't require installing PureOS, it would almost be worth

48:24.480 --> 48:28.720
putting PureOS on there and see what the battery life is and then putting Chrome OS back on

48:28.720 --> 48:30.280
there and see what the battery life is.

48:30.280 --> 48:31.760
You know, just, just for science.

48:31.760 --> 48:32.760
Yeah.

48:32.760 --> 48:33.760
Just for science.

48:33.760 --> 48:34.760
All right.

48:34.760 --> 48:39.480
Well, these scientists are getting back to the lab, so I encourage you to join us next

48:39.480 --> 48:44.560
week in that there chat room or mumble room, go to jblive.tv for that live extravaganza

48:44.560 --> 48:49.560
or jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar for the time and links to everything, including

48:49.560 --> 48:55.160
the new shows and all of that at linuxunplug.com slash 318.

48:55.160 --> 48:57.280
Go get more Wes Payne over at the Tech Snaps.

48:57.280 --> 48:58.280
Yeah.

48:58.280 --> 48:59.280
And now Linux Headlines.

48:59.280 --> 49:03.080
Wes, myself, and Drew bringing it to you every weekday.

49:03.080 --> 49:04.780
Linux Headlines, that show.

49:04.780 --> 49:09.120
And check out Self Hosted with Alex and Myself, episode one launches this week and then episode

49:09.120 --> 49:10.760
two with Wendell coming up very soon.

49:10.760 --> 49:36.600
We'll see you back here next Tuesday.

49:40.760 --> 49:50.240
Well, there you have it, I was wondering if cloud ready was legit or not, but it seems

49:50.240 --> 49:51.240
like it is.

49:51.240 --> 49:52.240
Yeah.

49:52.240 --> 49:53.240
Actually working pretty good.

49:53.240 --> 49:54.240
It did.

49:54.240 --> 49:55.240
It did work pretty good.

49:55.240 --> 49:56.240
I think I might give it a go myself.

49:56.240 --> 49:57.240
Yeah.

49:57.240 --> 49:58.240
If you haven't, if you got a machine laying around.

49:58.240 --> 49:59.240
I don't.

49:59.240 --> 50:00.240
Yeah.

50:00.240 --> 50:01.240
I don't know if there's, if it's possible to like compartmentalize it or install it.

50:01.240 --> 50:04.400
Virtual machine would be your best bet because by default, I just wanted to wipe the whole

50:04.400 --> 50:05.400
thing.

50:05.400 --> 50:08.880
Initially we were thinking, we were thinking just do a VM, but then when we had the Librem

50:08.880 --> 50:12.360
15 and the deliciousness of that irony, we couldn't resist.

50:12.360 --> 50:17.880
I stumbled upon cloud ready too just recently because my Chromebook was end of life.

50:17.880 --> 50:23.240
I was just surprised to see that Google has some life cycle for its Chrome devices.

50:23.240 --> 50:29.640
I mean, what can be so hard to give updates for a single program?

50:29.640 --> 50:35.680
I cannot understand that because even Windows XP or Windows 7 have a 10 years lifespan.

50:35.680 --> 50:37.160
How long have you had that Chromebook?

50:37.160 --> 50:42.600
Well, that's an Asus 720, it came out in 2030.

50:42.600 --> 50:47.720
There was first a feature freeze, so installing Linux applications was not possible.

50:47.720 --> 50:53.720
I can somehow understand it because the hardware given to ROM was not the best one.

50:53.720 --> 50:59.360
But I mean, leaving the people out there now without security updates is something I cannot

50:59.360 --> 51:00.360
understand.

51:00.360 --> 51:03.280
I really cannot understand because hardware is known.

51:03.280 --> 51:08.560
When you have your conflict file for that hardware, you just push a button and it releases

51:08.560 --> 51:09.560
out.

51:09.560 --> 51:10.560
You know the kernel is going to be supported.

51:10.560 --> 51:11.560
Right.

51:11.560 --> 51:12.560
I can't argue with that.

51:12.560 --> 51:14.640
You would think out of all of the OSs, this would be the one that could support the longest.

51:14.640 --> 51:15.640
But who knows?

51:15.640 --> 51:20.640
I'm sure there's partner dynamics involved, as they would say.

51:20.640 --> 51:25.280
The thing is, as you told at the beginning, these are computers that are used in schools,

51:25.280 --> 51:30.980
that are used for people that are not that gifted when it comes to computer knowledge.

51:30.980 --> 51:34.680
So all they want is they see an icon and they say, I have to update.

51:34.680 --> 51:39.020
So they push a button, the system is rebooting, and everything is done.

51:39.020 --> 51:41.640
And after five or six years, you stop with that.

51:41.640 --> 51:47.160
And now you leave all the people with security issues with a program that has, I think, the

51:47.160 --> 51:51.480
worst attacking surface you can have on the internet, like the internet browser.

51:51.480 --> 51:52.480
Yeah, absolutely.

51:52.480 --> 51:56.060
That is, for me, not understandable at all.

51:56.060 --> 51:57.060
Really not.

51:57.060 --> 52:01.400
I stumbled about cloud ready, and I probably will have to install that on my Chromebook

52:01.400 --> 52:02.400
now.

52:02.400 --> 52:05.320
I'd be curious to know if it works, because that's a great point you're making.

52:05.320 --> 52:09.240
And I think, obviously, the other elephant in the room on this conversation, that we've

52:09.240 --> 52:13.640
talked about so many times, I didn't go there, but the whole privacy aspect of it.

52:13.640 --> 52:19.360
It's just there's a clear privacy concern with Chromebooks that simply do not exist

52:19.360 --> 52:20.360
with desktop Linux.

52:20.360 --> 52:21.360
Not at all.

52:21.360 --> 52:22.360
Not in the same way at all.

52:22.360 --> 52:24.880
But that is an entire conversation in itself.

52:24.880 --> 52:26.640
So I didn't bring it up in this episode.

52:26.640 --> 52:30.440
And it's hard to tease that apart from the Chrome environment in general and using Google

52:30.440 --> 52:31.440
products.

52:31.440 --> 52:32.440
And Chromium.

52:32.440 --> 52:33.440
Yeah.

52:33.440 --> 52:35.200
So we just felt that we'd focus on the tech side of it.

52:35.200 --> 52:36.200
We don't need a two-hour on-board.

52:36.200 --> 52:37.200
Yeah.

52:37.200 --> 52:38.200
Oh, my gosh.

52:38.200 --> 52:40.640
Thinking about all that stuff, it's really something.

52:40.640 --> 52:44.720
I want to do a quick follow-up to a pic we did last week.

52:44.720 --> 52:48.760
So last week, I think it was, we talked about USB Top.

52:48.760 --> 52:54.920
But unfortunately, it is not available in Fedora, and it never will be, right, Carl?

52:54.920 --> 52:55.920
Never.

52:55.920 --> 52:56.920
It is there.

52:56.920 --> 52:57.920
It is there.

52:57.920 --> 52:58.920
What?

52:58.920 --> 52:59.920
It is there.

52:59.920 --> 53:00.920
Yeah.

53:00.920 --> 53:01.920
That's right.

53:01.920 --> 53:02.920
After the show, Carl contacted me and said, hey, what do you think about me giving that

53:02.920 --> 53:03.920
a crack?

53:03.920 --> 53:04.920
Carl, you're the best.

53:04.920 --> 53:05.920
That's awesome.

53:05.920 --> 53:06.920
He knew.

53:06.920 --> 53:07.920
He knew we needed it.

53:07.920 --> 53:08.920
Yeah.

53:08.920 --> 53:09.920
It wasn't too bad.

53:09.920 --> 53:10.920
It wasn't?

53:10.920 --> 53:11.920
No.

53:11.920 --> 53:12.920
It was a pretty straightforward spec file.

53:12.920 --> 53:13.920
I love it.

53:13.920 --> 53:14.920
That's awesome.

53:14.920 --> 53:15.920
Best audience ever.

53:15.920 --> 53:16.920
OK.

53:16.920 --> 53:17.920
Ladies and gentlemen, another round of applause is due in this episode.

53:17.920 --> 53:21.640
We're very happy to say another episode of Brunch with Brent will be coming out tomorrow

53:21.640 --> 53:22.640
on the Extras feed.

53:22.640 --> 53:23.640
Hey-oh.

53:23.640 --> 53:25.680
Brent, we should tease this one a little bit.

53:25.680 --> 53:29.200
What can we expect from this week's episode of Brunch with Brent?

53:29.200 --> 53:31.720
Well, last week we had Drew on.

53:31.720 --> 53:33.800
I don't know if everyone caught that.

53:33.800 --> 53:37.240
And this week, Wes, you make it on with me.

53:37.240 --> 53:39.480
And we have a great, great conversation.

53:39.480 --> 53:44.120
We go into a whole bunch of stuff that is completely different than all of the previous

53:44.120 --> 53:46.760
Brunch with Brent, which is the case.

53:46.760 --> 53:49.380
Every new guest brings a new flavor.

53:49.380 --> 53:54.480
And so this week, I don't know, we chatted about a whole bunch of adventures in learning

53:54.480 --> 53:58.960
and problem solving, because Wes and I are all about that.

53:58.960 --> 54:03.640
We talked about the art of being introverted and agreeable, which that's me.

54:03.640 --> 54:05.560
That doesn't sound like us at all.

54:05.560 --> 54:07.120
No, not at all.

54:07.120 --> 54:10.440
And Wes really talked about the value of hammock time.

54:10.440 --> 54:14.280
And so you can learn more about that.

54:14.280 --> 54:15.280
Extras.show.

54:15.280 --> 54:16.280
Yeah.

54:16.280 --> 54:17.280
Hmm.

54:17.280 --> 54:18.280
That's hammock time.

54:18.280 --> 54:19.280
I want a hammock.

54:19.280 --> 54:20.600
Can we get one of those in the studio?

54:20.600 --> 54:21.600
I think we need one.

54:21.600 --> 54:23.800
I think that would be really good.

54:23.800 --> 54:24.800
Whew.

54:24.800 --> 54:29.880
I'm, you know, I can't believe we've launched The Daily Show a little bit.

54:29.880 --> 54:32.800
Because so many times in the past, we were like, nope, not good enough, damn it.

54:32.800 --> 54:34.600
And we've killed it.

54:34.600 --> 54:39.040
And so this time, I don't know, I think part of me thought we were never going to actually

54:39.040 --> 54:40.040
launch.

54:40.040 --> 54:41.040
It didn't feel like it, right?

54:41.040 --> 54:43.520
We were going to keep contemplating it, keep shooting it down for one reason or another.

54:43.520 --> 54:44.520
Yeah.

54:44.520 --> 54:50.880
But the thing where we had our breakthrough, I have to say, is I think by A, killing it

54:50.880 --> 54:54.400
and then giving space to reconsider it, like with no pressure.

54:54.400 --> 54:58.560
And then B, the test pilots we did, where we started.

54:58.560 --> 55:01.960
So we're kind of splitting up the work a little bit.

55:01.960 --> 55:04.720
So it'll be myself, Wes, and Drew.

55:04.720 --> 55:07.960
And that was kind of one of the breakthroughs we had, is we realized it's probably going

55:07.960 --> 55:11.480
to be a lot more sustainable if we don't make it all just Chris or just Joe.

55:11.480 --> 55:12.480
Not one of us goes crazy.

55:12.480 --> 55:13.480
Yeah.

55:13.480 --> 55:16.080
And so then we just kind of had to figure out like the math on that, how to set up like

55:16.080 --> 55:17.080
a backup system.

55:17.080 --> 55:20.160
And we have a check-in system that we have, because it's got to happen every single day.

55:20.160 --> 55:21.160
Right.

55:21.160 --> 55:25.120
I mean, we both had to learn how to and got to take advantage of the team system we have

55:25.120 --> 55:26.120
now.

55:26.120 --> 55:27.120
Yeah.

55:27.120 --> 55:28.120
Yeah.

55:28.120 --> 55:30.640
And we had to increase staffing a little bit because news research is a big part of what

55:30.640 --> 55:31.640
we do.

55:31.640 --> 55:36.320
And there's a pipeline now that brings in all of this news and it just required a little

55:36.320 --> 55:37.320
bit of staffing.

55:37.320 --> 55:38.320
Yeah.

55:38.320 --> 55:40.840
You don't have to, you know, draw the depths of all those barbaric Linux news sites out

55:40.840 --> 55:41.840
there.

55:41.840 --> 55:42.840
Just come to us.

55:42.840 --> 55:43.840
We got this.

55:43.840 --> 55:48.360
What's going to be a challenge for me, and it may even happen as soon as next week, possibly,

55:48.360 --> 55:53.480
because at some point I'm going to be on the road again and I'll have to do the show from

55:53.480 --> 55:54.480
the road somehow.

55:54.480 --> 55:57.000
But I got a decent mobile recording setup.

55:57.000 --> 55:58.000
That's true.

55:58.000 --> 55:59.000
We've been working on that.

55:59.000 --> 56:00.000
Yeah.

56:00.000 --> 56:01.000
We're really going to have to figure it out now.

56:01.000 --> 56:02.000
Mm-hmm.

56:02.000 --> 56:03.000
Mm-hmm.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.240
Plus, we got a good backup system, so I could always pull the backup lever.

56:05.240 --> 56:06.240
Of course.

56:06.240 --> 56:08.220
And just be like, bail me out.

56:08.220 --> 56:09.360
So I could always do that, too.

56:09.360 --> 56:10.360
Yeah.

56:10.360 --> 56:12.800
So look for, you know, varied JB voices from time to time.

56:12.800 --> 56:13.800
Yeah.

56:13.800 --> 56:16.120
But I'll generally be there on Mondays for now.

56:16.120 --> 56:19.840
At least I would kick things off, and then Wes and I throughout the week, and then Drew

56:19.840 --> 56:20.840
on Fridays.

56:20.840 --> 56:21.840
Fridays with Drew.

56:21.840 --> 56:46.840
Yeah.
