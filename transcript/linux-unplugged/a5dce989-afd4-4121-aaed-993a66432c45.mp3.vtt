00:00.000 --> 00:02.080
breaking news here on the show.

00:02.080 --> 00:05.520
It looks like it's coming from Mike Larbs over at for Onyx.

00:06.720 --> 00:08.920
This is CNN breaking news.

00:08.920 --> 00:14.520
Amazon is hiring DX, VK, Mesa and Proton Linux developers for for Luna Cloud Gaming.

00:14.520 --> 00:16.220
Is that their streaming thing, Luna?

00:16.220 --> 00:17.760
That's their cloud gaming thing.

00:17.760 --> 00:18.700
This is big.

00:18.700 --> 00:22.260
So now you're going to have Collabra, Valve and Amazon,

00:22.260 --> 00:25.560
all funding developers to work towards this same stack.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.660
Wow. This is a big news day.

00:27.660 --> 00:29.000
There's a lot going on today.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.840
I wonder if that means Luna's rebasing from Windows to Linux.

00:32.100 --> 00:34.280
Yeah, that's you would have to think, right?

00:34.280 --> 00:36.820
The job posting also provides some details of the work.

00:36.820 --> 00:40.820
It says, quote, The role involves working with Proton, a compatibility layer

00:40.820 --> 00:43.080
to run Windows games on Linux using wine.

00:43.080 --> 00:47.320
Luna is committed to working with the open source community around Proton.

00:47.760 --> 00:51.700
This role will commit code to open source projects such as Proton and wine

00:51.920 --> 00:55.360
in pursuit of running games in a stable and performant manner.

00:55.900 --> 00:57.700
There's a lot to kind of unpack here,

00:57.700 --> 01:00.260
because it could suggest they are switching to Linux on the back end.

01:00.800 --> 01:02.040
I mean, that would be pretty incredible

01:02.040 --> 01:05.640
because that would mean both Stadia and Amazon's offerings

01:06.040 --> 01:09.300
require that the games work on Linux.

01:09.540 --> 01:11.480
Then you had the steam deck coming.

01:11.480 --> 01:15.140
Man, that's a lot of momentum towards games,

01:15.420 --> 01:18.720
at least getting some level of compatibility with Proton, right?

01:18.720 --> 01:23.160
Maybe not native Linux games, but Proton games, because this is huge.

01:23.160 --> 01:26.220
I think if you're going to if this if Proton, if targeting for Proton now

01:26.220 --> 01:30.000
means you get your game running on the deck and you get your game

01:30.000 --> 01:33.740
running on Luna, that incentivizes developers to actually make that happen.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.240
It's a starting point, right?

01:35.240 --> 01:39.480
Like if they're doing this, then they're definitely working on a Linux platform

01:39.480 --> 01:42.840
to run games on, which means this probably is the first step.

01:42.840 --> 01:47.620
Like first, having their existing portfolio of Luna games working

01:47.620 --> 01:51.380
and then their next step is opening the doors for Linux native ones.

01:51.380 --> 01:53.960
That's the optimist in me. I'm hoping that's what's happening.

01:53.980 --> 01:55.820
Yeah, right. Yeah, no, I'm with you.

01:55.820 --> 01:58.820
Well, and what is this also going to do to the steam stats?

01:58.820 --> 02:02.100
Because I'm sure there are internal stats that steam tracks

02:02.100 --> 02:04.200
of how many people are playing games on Linux.

02:04.560 --> 02:08.540
If more games are playable on Linux, does that increase the percentage

02:08.540 --> 02:09.740
of Linux gamers?

02:09.740 --> 02:11.640
I mean, they'll probably benefit just from seeing developers

02:11.640 --> 02:13.900
more interested in targeting that platform now.

02:13.900 --> 02:15.680
And the pricing is not bad.

02:15.680 --> 02:19.040
I mean, it's it's something that like only a huge company like Amazon could offer.

02:19.040 --> 02:22.180
If you think about what they're doing on the back end for the US right now,

02:22.180 --> 02:26.460
it's going to be six dollars a month and you get access to games with that price.

02:26.780 --> 02:29.920
And then they're going to offer like a package that's a step up

02:29.920 --> 02:34.000
and you get higher refresh and you get access to even more games.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.600
And then there's going to be a family plan they're going to have

02:37.000 --> 02:40.100
where for like a small like three dollar a month additional fee,

02:40.440 --> 02:42.040
your kids can get access to it all.

02:42.040 --> 02:44.200
And it's filtered for kids depending on their age.

02:44.200 --> 02:46.540
It's a family plan for like multiple people.

02:47.080 --> 02:49.580
I don't know. It's also early days on this stuff.

02:49.580 --> 02:51.620
But I like seeing the tech involved.

02:51.860 --> 02:54.120
And like, what what kind of investments will this get?

02:54.120 --> 02:56.520
How much adoption will it all be? Kind of similar.

02:56.760 --> 03:01.000
I mean, Amazon seems to have a better stick-to-it-iveness than Google does.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.800
Maybe maybe we'll see something interesting here.

03:02.800 --> 03:08.040
Yeah, maybe. But also, I feel like Amazon music and Amazon photos,

03:08.040 --> 03:09.740
those are not the big services.

03:09.740 --> 03:11.840
That's true. I use them. They're nice.

03:11.840 --> 03:13.500
Yeah, they are. Yeah, I agree.

03:13.500 --> 03:15.740
And they often have worked with Linux.

03:15.740 --> 03:25.820
So there's that. Hello, friends,

03:25.820 --> 03:28.720
and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

03:28.720 --> 03:30.720
My name is Chris. My name is Wenz.

03:30.720 --> 03:32.720
And my name is Brent. Hello, you two.

03:32.720 --> 03:35.600
I like the outfits. Nice job on the coordination.

03:35.600 --> 03:38.100
Well, thank you. It's the purple.

03:38.360 --> 03:41.360
We have a very fresh edition of the show.

03:41.360 --> 03:43.040
In fact, we'll be talking about Pop!

03:43.040 --> 03:47.380
We'll be talking about Pop! OS 2110, which was released just a couple of hours ago

03:47.380 --> 03:51.980
as we record, but we've had our hands on the ISOs for a little bit longer than that.

03:51.980 --> 03:55.380
And we've tried it out on a range of hardware from the high end to the low end.

03:55.380 --> 03:56.520
And we'll give you our take.

03:56.520 --> 04:00.420
Plus, Carl Rochelle, the CEO of System76, will drop by to talk about a few of the features

04:00.720 --> 04:05.460
and correct a few things that are out there as far as like versions of GNOME and whatnot.

04:05.800 --> 04:09.000
And on top of all of that, we have our community news and well,

04:09.200 --> 04:10.960
a few things I got to tell you about.

04:10.960 --> 04:14.600
And as always, we're going to round it out with some pics and some emails and all of that.

04:14.600 --> 04:20.180
So, before we go any further, let's say time appropriate greetings to our mumble room.

04:20.180 --> 04:21.280
Hello, Virtual Lug.

04:21.280 --> 04:22.180
Hello.

04:22.180 --> 04:23.380
Hello.

04:23.380 --> 04:24.240
Hello, there.

04:24.240 --> 04:25.640
Hello.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.080
Hello, all of you.

04:27.080 --> 04:28.720
Man, we got a great showing today.

04:28.720 --> 04:33.520
I'm really, really grateful you're here because this is like one of our last Tuesdays.

04:33.520 --> 04:36.220
And then we're moving to Sunday for our live time.

04:36.220 --> 04:38.920
Next week, it's the Tuxes.

04:38.920 --> 04:39.960
Very excited about that.

04:39.960 --> 04:43.060
So, Tuxes.party, if you haven't gotten your chance to vote yet.

04:43.400 --> 04:45.100
So, that'll be the 21st.

04:45.100 --> 04:49.000
And then our last Tuesday live stream, which is kind of actually making me sad now

04:49.000 --> 04:52.180
that I say that, will be December 28th.

04:52.180 --> 04:57.080
And that'll be our predictions where we not only own which predictions we got right or wrong,

04:57.080 --> 04:58.640
but we'll make new ones for 2021.

04:58.640 --> 05:00.380
I know. I know.

05:00.380 --> 05:02.020
I know. I don't even know.

05:02.020 --> 05:03.820
Like, I've been thinking about it.

05:03.820 --> 05:05.880
There's a lot going on.

05:05.880 --> 05:09.360
It's going to be a hard one to do predictions for, but we'll have to figure that out.

05:09.360 --> 05:15.120
And then just shortly after that, on January 2nd, we're going to do a potluck and new server

05:15.120 --> 05:19.200
christening at the studio right here at JB1.

05:19.200 --> 05:21.740
And I'm trying out Get Together for this one.

05:21.740 --> 05:23.900
This is an open source one that you can self-host.

05:23.900 --> 05:25.600
It's a meetup alternative.

05:25.600 --> 05:30.340
It's gettogether.community.jbhq if you want to see our page.

05:30.340 --> 05:32.080
And I'll have a link in the show notes.

05:32.080 --> 05:33.080
And go there.

05:33.080 --> 05:35.440
I figure why not use like a small scale event like this?

05:35.440 --> 05:36.380
Because it's just going to be a hand.

05:36.380 --> 05:38.480
It's going to be an intimate gathering.

05:38.480 --> 05:43.620
And great opportunity to try a meetup alternative that people have suggested before.

05:43.620 --> 05:47.860
So we'll have a new server christening get together link in the show notes.

05:47.860 --> 05:49.800
I don't know if you join it.

05:49.800 --> 05:52.500
I don't know how it works, but I'd like, yeah, you attend it.

05:52.500 --> 05:53.500
That's their option.

05:53.500 --> 05:54.500
You attend it.

05:54.500 --> 05:55.500
I want to know how many of you are coming.

05:55.500 --> 05:59.140
I've heard from like three people and I expect it's going to be somewhere between three and

05:59.140 --> 06:00.140
a dozen.

06:00.140 --> 06:01.140
Now, look, I know.

06:01.140 --> 06:06.080
I know this is, you know, the Pacific Northwest is like the Westest of the West Coast and

06:06.080 --> 06:08.680
it is way up in the corner of the country.

06:08.680 --> 06:12.940
I appreciate that it is difficult to get to because I frequently have to drive here.

06:12.940 --> 06:13.940
It's a pain in the butt.

06:13.940 --> 06:16.940
And I know it's not, it's not possible for everybody to get here.

06:16.940 --> 06:19.780
So we are going to attempt to live stream this thing.

06:19.780 --> 06:22.860
I mean, I don't know how it's going to work.

06:22.860 --> 06:24.660
I'll attend virtually if you let me.

06:24.660 --> 06:25.900
Yeah, I'm going to try.

06:25.900 --> 06:29.860
So Brent didn't know it, but like yesterday he kind of volunteered to be like the camera

06:29.860 --> 06:30.860
guy.

06:30.860 --> 06:31.860
Oh yeah.

06:31.860 --> 06:32.860
Yeah, yeah, sure.

06:32.860 --> 06:33.860
MC Jerva.

06:33.860 --> 06:34.860
What else do I have to do?

06:34.860 --> 06:38.620
You know, Brent, as you walk around with my internet phone connected back to OBS, right?

06:38.620 --> 06:43.500
So you, we could take people out to the server garage and when we kick it on.

06:43.500 --> 06:44.500
Now you're talking.

06:44.500 --> 06:46.180
I mean, keep the dreams going.

06:46.180 --> 06:48.620
And then what we'll do is we'll just transition to a traditional stream.

06:48.620 --> 06:56.380
So my thinking is people will show up around like 1130, 11 AM, maybe 11 AM, uh, JB time.

06:56.380 --> 07:00.340
We'll do, we'll get the potluck going, you know, we'll eat around 1130 around noon.

07:00.340 --> 07:03.460
We'll get the servers fired up, hoping all that goes well.

07:03.460 --> 07:09.060
And then around one, we will, the three of us, you, Wes and myself, we'll move into the

07:09.060 --> 07:14.100
studio and people can hang out in the living room and listen to the live recording from

07:14.100 --> 07:15.100
the living room of the studio.

07:15.100 --> 07:19.740
We'll put the speaker out there, we'll bring it up on the TV and uh, so that people can

07:19.740 --> 07:24.820
attend a live lup if they like, and then we'll wrap up the show and um, people can, you know,

07:24.820 --> 07:25.820
say their goodbyes and that'll be it.

07:25.820 --> 07:29.500
It'll probably be like, you know, from like 11 AM to 4 PM is what we'll probably do.

07:29.500 --> 07:32.220
Uh, just to be clear, um, does this mean I'm invited then?

07:32.220 --> 07:33.220
Yeah.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.540
You're supposed to be down here then.

07:34.540 --> 07:35.540
Yeah.

07:35.540 --> 07:36.540
Yeah.

07:36.540 --> 07:37.540
Yeah.

07:37.540 --> 07:41.420
In fact, I'd like you to show up before then, you know, cause we got like this whole thing

07:41.420 --> 07:44.100
we're planning, you know, I gotta do some catering too.

07:44.100 --> 07:45.740
We gotta have some food there, right?

07:45.740 --> 07:46.740
Yeah.

07:46.740 --> 07:47.740
Right.

07:47.740 --> 07:48.740
You're going to have to do some cooking.

07:48.740 --> 07:52.620
Everybody's going to want a taste of that brunch, you know, they're talking about brunch

07:52.620 --> 07:56.860
and I've also decided to punt a new Linux show launch that I had planned for the beginning

07:56.860 --> 07:57.860
of the year.

07:57.860 --> 08:02.300
Uh, because I am, I'm trying to do too much.

08:02.300 --> 08:07.940
It's you know, last year the holidays were like not even a blip on my radar because everybody

08:07.940 --> 08:08.940
just canceled all our plans.

08:08.940 --> 08:14.220
But this year it's like this fractured beast that has become this entire thing that I have

08:14.220 --> 08:15.220
to manage.

08:15.220 --> 08:17.420
Plus there's a business I'm running, plus there's shows I'm trying to do.

08:17.420 --> 08:20.360
And I want to do a good launch when I do launch a new show.

08:20.360 --> 08:24.620
So I'm keeping my powder dry and I've decided not to launch a new show at the new year.

08:24.620 --> 08:28.600
But LUP is still moving to Sunday, LAN will be moving to later in the week.

08:28.600 --> 08:32.660
We're still just kind of determining the details of that, so I don't have that for everybody

08:32.660 --> 08:33.660
yet.

08:33.660 --> 08:36.780
All the more reason to stay subscribed so you've seen what happens regardless of what

08:36.780 --> 08:37.780
we say.

08:37.780 --> 08:39.340
Great point, Wes.

08:39.340 --> 08:40.340
You know what?

08:40.340 --> 08:41.740
Pro, pro podcaster right there.

08:41.740 --> 08:42.740
Good thinking.

08:42.740 --> 08:44.820
So we will have a new LUP live day.

08:44.820 --> 08:48.220
We will have a new year party and we will have a new server christening all happening

08:48.220 --> 08:55.020
on January 2nd, get together.community.jbhq for the link to that or link in the show notes.

08:55.020 --> 09:00.460
And with all of that, let's move into the news today and really there is one big story

09:00.460 --> 09:04.580
as far as the Linux desktop and Linux community is concerned, and that is the release of Pop

09:04.580 --> 09:05.580
OS 2110.

09:05.580 --> 09:11.060
So joining us is Carl Rochelle, the founder and CEO of System76, of course, the place

09:11.060 --> 09:14.100
that makes computers born to run Linux and Pop OS.

09:14.100 --> 09:16.220
Who better to chat Pop OS 2110 with?

09:16.220 --> 09:18.020
Hey, Carl, welcome back to the show.

09:18.020 --> 09:19.140
Thanks for having me.

09:19.140 --> 09:20.140
Thank you for being here.

09:20.140 --> 09:21.380
Super last minute and all of that.

09:21.380 --> 09:27.940
But today, just like two hours ago, Pop OS was released.

09:27.940 --> 09:32.380
And so we thought, you know, we got to talk about this with you because it's a mix of

09:32.380 --> 09:34.060
really interesting components.

09:34.060 --> 09:36.360
I think maybe that's where I want to start with you.

09:36.360 --> 09:39.980
The kernel, for example, 5.15.5, right?

09:39.980 --> 09:40.980
Super fresh.

09:40.980 --> 09:47.540
But GNOME 3.3.8, yet at the same time, there's this new application library that is a totally

09:47.540 --> 09:50.780
new innovation from System76 and the refresh OS feature.

09:50.780 --> 09:55.660
So there's like a there's a mix here that feels like, are we starting to see the building

09:55.660 --> 09:59.620
blocks of what might actually be a full Cosmic desktop one day?

09:59.620 --> 10:03.160
Perhaps visually, but not really under the hood.

10:03.160 --> 10:06.280
And actually Pop 2110 is based on GNOME 40.

10:06.280 --> 10:07.280
So it is.

10:07.280 --> 10:08.280
OK.

10:08.280 --> 10:09.280
Yeah.

10:09.280 --> 10:10.480
So it's GNOME 40.

10:10.480 --> 10:14.780
Our last release was in June and it was 2104, which, you know, supposed to be April, right?

10:14.780 --> 10:17.100
And this one's 2110, which is supposed to be October.

10:17.100 --> 10:21.180
But Cosmic, the first release, we want to spend a bit more time to polish it up and

10:21.180 --> 10:22.180
get it ready to go.

10:22.180 --> 10:26.260
And then it was a shortened time for this cycle and we wanted to get some things in

10:26.260 --> 10:31.300
and adapting to GNOME 40 is what actually pushed it out further to make it to December.

10:31.300 --> 10:37.980
So we anticipate the next release, 2204, to actually be in April next time.

10:37.980 --> 10:44.660
But that's the reasons that that delayed and GNOME 40, it was a lot of work just adapting

10:44.660 --> 10:48.460
the Cosmic workflow to the changes that came with GNOME 40.

10:48.460 --> 10:49.460
Right.

10:49.460 --> 10:52.540
So my thought there, too, is there were some back end changes, too.

10:52.540 --> 10:58.180
So like the Launchpad transition happened from Launchpad to, is it GitHub now or GitLab?

10:58.180 --> 10:59.180
I don't know.

10:59.180 --> 11:01.100
But you've moved off of Launchpad for the back end stuff now.

11:01.100 --> 11:02.100
Right.

11:02.100 --> 11:03.100
Yeah.

11:03.100 --> 11:04.100
We're hosting our own our own packages.

11:04.100 --> 11:08.380
Those are the custom System86 packages that we create for Pop OS.

11:08.380 --> 11:11.700
The rest of the stack still comes from the Ubuntu repositories.

11:11.700 --> 11:18.340
The main reason for moving off of Launchpad was during our last release, it would take,

11:18.340 --> 11:23.500
we probably lost a week or more waiting for builds.

11:23.500 --> 11:30.260
And so we push a new build, QA would get it, they'd run it through their process.

11:30.260 --> 11:34.540
There'd be some changes that needed to be made and then we push it up again and it would

11:34.540 --> 11:39.180
be hours until hours, sometimes a day, until we had new packages built.

11:39.180 --> 11:41.780
So we just got tired of waiting.

11:41.780 --> 11:50.460
So we built a new CI, built a new service for the packages that we built and that dramatically

11:50.460 --> 11:58.100
increased our iteration time from engineering to QA to release.

11:58.100 --> 12:04.220
Now if I were to predict, and it's our predictions episode in a couple episodes, if I were to

12:04.220 --> 12:09.780
predict that Cosmic would rebase one day off of Ubuntu, would I have a good shot of that

12:09.780 --> 12:11.020
prediction coming true?

12:11.020 --> 12:13.020
I think that's unlikely.

12:13.020 --> 12:16.020
That would be a pretty significant change for our users.

12:16.020 --> 12:20.100
I don't know if it would be an improvement for them.

12:20.100 --> 12:27.100
We've looked at Fedora and Arch and other options for basing Pop OS.

12:27.100 --> 12:32.940
And at the end of the day, Ubuntu makes an incredible base to build desktop experiences

12:32.940 --> 12:38.180
off of and we think we can achieve the same kind of advantages that there are on Arch

12:38.180 --> 12:41.980
and some of the advantages in Fedora and some of the things they're doing in Silverblue,

12:41.980 --> 12:43.900
but on top of an Ubuntu base.

12:43.900 --> 12:44.900
Sure.

12:44.900 --> 12:50.780
So you sort of feel that the compatibility that an Ubuntu base provides is maybe one

12:50.780 --> 12:52.180
of the features of Pop OS?

12:52.180 --> 12:53.180
Right, yeah.

12:53.180 --> 12:57.180
So you can look at what we're doing with Linux kernel now and we've been rolling on kernels

12:57.180 --> 13:01.580
for quite some time, although they were always based on the Ubuntu kernel with patches for

13:01.580 --> 13:05.580
new hardware enablement that we required for shipping products.

13:05.580 --> 13:10.660
But there's a lot of other improvements that are coming faster in the Linux kernel that

13:10.660 --> 13:15.620
we wanted to deliver in a similar way to the way Arch provides that to their users.

13:15.620 --> 13:20.980
So now we have a new kernel policy where we're tracking the latest releases and running it

13:20.980 --> 13:25.820
through the same QA process that we run the latest NVIDIA drivers through.

13:25.820 --> 13:33.220
So the QA team has the full access to a complete lab of 76 hardware which covers a lot of chip

13:33.220 --> 13:35.500
sets and configurations.

13:35.500 --> 13:41.340
In doing so, our confidence grew that we'd be able to do it in a quality way that matched

13:41.340 --> 13:43.860
what we were able to deliver before.

13:43.860 --> 13:48.060
And so that's one of the shifts and things that we're learning from other distributions

13:48.060 --> 13:53.180
is that users appreciate fresh packages and so we're working on, it's one step on working

13:53.180 --> 13:54.180
on delivering that.

13:54.180 --> 13:55.180
I love hearing that.

13:55.180 --> 13:56.180
Yeah.

13:56.180 --> 13:58.340
You know, so that kind of stuff is really music to my ears.

13:58.340 --> 14:00.460
So yeah, I'm one of those users.

14:00.460 --> 14:04.400
There's a few other things in here that I just wanted to cover with you as much as you

14:04.400 --> 14:05.500
care to go into it.

14:05.500 --> 14:10.820
But a couple of features that I think are really sort of fascinating, one of them is

14:10.820 --> 14:15.620
this refresh OS feature that gives you the option to reinstall the OS without deleting

14:15.620 --> 14:16.620
user data.

14:16.620 --> 14:21.180
Can you just talk a little bit about the thought about prioritizing that as a feature, kind

14:21.180 --> 14:22.180
of what went into that?

14:22.180 --> 14:24.660
At first, it's actually been around for years.

14:24.660 --> 14:30.860
It started, I think, and it might have been, I mean, in 2018, but we wanted to build a

14:30.860 --> 14:32.780
new installer for Pop!

14:32.780 --> 14:33.780
OS.

14:33.780 --> 14:38.220
Ubiquity, we had some problems with the way that the powder box experience for an OEM

14:38.220 --> 14:39.220
customer worked.

14:39.220 --> 14:43.180
And so we wanted to build a new installer and we architected it in such a way that it

14:43.180 --> 14:46.540
would create a restore partition.

14:46.540 --> 14:50.460
And when you receive your computer, you're actually, during your setup, it's actually

14:50.460 --> 14:52.080
installing the operating system.

14:52.080 --> 14:56.540
But because of the way it was written and its efficiency, it installs it so quickly

14:56.540 --> 15:00.260
that it doesn't feel like there's some gap of time.

15:00.260 --> 15:04.480
What that enables us to do is offer full disencryption out of the box.

15:04.480 --> 15:07.440
So the restore partition was kind of free.

15:07.440 --> 15:10.980
We got that for free when we were redesigning the installer.

15:10.980 --> 15:16.660
And one of the slickest parts of it is that you can go into the restore partition and

15:16.660 --> 15:18.140
you can launch it from within settings.

15:18.140 --> 15:22.820
You can go to OS upgrades and recovery and you can just click a button that says refresh

15:22.820 --> 15:26.760
OS and it'll reboot to the recovery partition.

15:26.760 --> 15:32.640
Click a couple of buttons, reboot, and your system is brand new, fresh out of the box.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.660
And you have all of your files and documents and everything else there.

15:35.660 --> 15:41.460
So it's not only just a nice feature for disaster recovery if something goes wrong, but every

15:41.460 --> 15:45.260
once in a while you've been running your computer for an upgrading for a few releases and you

15:45.260 --> 15:50.140
just want to clear out perhaps old dead apps that you haven't been using for a while.

15:50.140 --> 15:54.740
It's just a way to start out brand new without losing anything or taking a step back.

15:54.740 --> 15:55.740
Yep.

15:55.740 --> 15:58.220
And just to be clear, because there's been some question online, is that available on

15:58.220 --> 16:02.880
any machine that does a clean install of POP or is that only available on system 76 machines?

16:02.880 --> 16:05.060
That's any clean install of POP.

16:05.060 --> 16:06.060
All right.

16:06.060 --> 16:09.460
That's a feature that I think is also going to be really great like on my Raspberry Pi

16:09.460 --> 16:14.180
400, which is one of the places I've been running POP 2110.

16:14.180 --> 16:18.620
And that's an area where you could definitely get a little performance benefit every now

16:18.620 --> 16:20.540
and then probably refreshing your OS like that.

16:20.540 --> 16:21.540
Oh yeah.

16:21.540 --> 16:27.780
And the other thing with the Raspberry Pi or regular PCs as well, but if you're using

16:27.780 --> 16:31.860
it to tinker with stuff and you're building things and experimenting and you just want

16:31.860 --> 16:36.060
to start fresh, you don't have to download an ISO, burn it to a USB drive or any of that

16:36.060 --> 16:37.060
kind of stuff.

16:37.060 --> 16:42.380
You just reboot the restore partition, reinstall and you have a fresh install.

16:42.380 --> 16:43.380
That really is.

16:43.380 --> 16:44.380
All right.

16:44.380 --> 16:47.060
I want to, right before I let you go, I just want to zoom out a little bit.

16:47.060 --> 16:54.660
You know, I've been following you for 16 years and I know how dedicated you guys are

16:54.660 --> 16:59.700
to this craft and to the Linux community and free software.

16:59.700 --> 17:03.040
And I'd like to pick your brain as we're at the end of the year.

17:03.040 --> 17:07.780
It's been a bit of a rough year with interacting with certain open source projects online for

17:07.780 --> 17:09.820
system 76 over the year.

17:09.820 --> 17:16.060
I'm curious to know what you think will be different from a system 76 standpoint in 2022

17:16.060 --> 17:21.660
and how the company goes forward with community interaction or upstream coordination and that

17:21.660 --> 17:22.660
kind of stuff.

17:22.660 --> 17:33.820
I think the recent kerfluffles, I guess they are, I think they're narrow when it really

17:33.820 --> 17:35.660
comes down to it.

17:35.660 --> 17:39.340
The challenges that we tend to have are in areas that we disagree with the presentation

17:39.340 --> 17:40.620
layer of GNOME.

17:40.620 --> 17:45.780
We think that a desktop environment should be a number of components that you put together

17:45.780 --> 17:47.540
to build an experience.

17:47.540 --> 17:55.560
And that experience can be unique for a user or unique for a company or unique for a project.

17:55.560 --> 18:03.820
And that differs in the way that GNOME is progressing, which is fine, it's just a difference.

18:03.820 --> 18:12.340
So I think now that we're working on a desktop environment that will be unique and we coordinate

18:12.340 --> 18:19.180
with other areas of the GNOME stack that aren't as controversial, I suspect that those type

18:19.180 --> 18:28.080
of things that have really come up since 2017 with theming or icons or any of those changes

18:28.080 --> 18:32.700
that we tend to think are necessary for our users, since we won't be doing those things

18:32.700 --> 18:36.060
or modifying GNOME in that way, I think it's less likely that we'll have those type of

18:36.060 --> 18:37.220
controversies show up.

18:37.220 --> 18:38.220
Sure.

18:38.220 --> 18:39.620
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

18:39.620 --> 18:44.680
It's been an interesting journey for Pop OS because it's clear there's a real natural

18:44.680 --> 18:49.820
evolution line here where I admit it, when it first came onto the scene, I was like,

18:49.820 --> 18:50.900
why do we need this?

18:50.900 --> 18:53.080
This is essentially Ubuntu.

18:53.080 --> 18:55.580
Why do we need Ubuntu with a different theme again?

18:55.580 --> 19:01.000
And now here we are with 2110 and there's a lot of things Pop OS is doing differently.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.380
And it's a lot of value add stuff.

19:02.380 --> 19:04.540
I don't have issue with any of it.

19:04.540 --> 19:11.700
And I wonder if just this desktop change and getting a stronger visual identity isn't just

19:11.700 --> 19:15.460
part of this evolutionary process, like it was always going to happen.

19:15.460 --> 19:20.340
And in free software, you have a lot of times people that are overworked.

19:20.340 --> 19:23.040
There's a lot of passion on both sides.

19:23.040 --> 19:27.180
People are in it because they're passionate about it and resources are limited.

19:27.180 --> 19:31.580
And it's an environment that just can kind of sometimes lead to conflict over passionate

19:31.580 --> 19:32.760
ideas.

19:32.760 --> 19:35.480
But it kind of seems like this was maybe always the trajectory.

19:35.480 --> 19:40.540
These things are going to kind of happen as a new desktop distribution kind of comes into

19:40.540 --> 19:43.620
mainstream and it kind of discovers its own identity.

19:43.620 --> 19:48.580
I think what should be expected is that people, I think in the value of open source and what

19:48.580 --> 19:55.820
it is, is in that people can shape it to solve problems for other people.

19:55.820 --> 20:02.420
And I think that's one of the core principles of open source.

20:02.420 --> 20:06.020
The purpose of what we build is to enable people to do things with it.

20:06.020 --> 20:08.900
Sometimes we think about that through the computers we create.

20:08.900 --> 20:11.500
And we've been able to do that less so.

20:11.500 --> 20:14.540
We think a lot about how people get things out of our products.

20:14.540 --> 20:20.620
So when we develop a computer, we think about how can we make the best machine learning

20:20.620 --> 20:27.180
desktop, not for people to put things on our platform, but to use our platform to get things

20:27.180 --> 20:28.540
out of it.

20:28.540 --> 20:33.700
And with the operating system, that's just an extension of that effort is enabling people

20:33.700 --> 20:39.300
in the most efficient and best possible way to create things with the software that we

20:39.300 --> 20:40.300
make.

20:40.300 --> 20:45.060
And I think that's going to also be the case with cosmic desktop environment as we build

20:45.060 --> 20:46.060
it.

20:46.060 --> 20:51.580
It's not something that's modular, independent components that the people will be able to

20:51.580 --> 20:53.740
put together into their own desktop environments.

20:53.740 --> 21:01.140
And I think that that main mission of System76 to empower people is just being extended by

21:01.140 --> 21:03.460
the work that we're going to be doing on the cosmic desktop.

21:03.460 --> 21:05.340
I'm looking forward to seeing where it goes.

21:05.340 --> 21:08.820
I will have links in the show notes so everyone can check out Pop OS.

21:08.820 --> 21:11.460
Carl, I hope you guys have a great 2022.

21:11.460 --> 21:15.180
Is there a particular tangential technology to Linux?

21:15.180 --> 21:18.340
Is there another technology that's developing right now that you're getting excited about

21:18.340 --> 21:20.460
that you're going to keep an eye on over 2022?

21:20.460 --> 21:23.980
I couldn't be more excited about the Linux desktop in general.

21:23.980 --> 21:28.220
Everything that's happening, there's innovation happening in all sorts of different corners.

21:28.220 --> 21:32.900
So yeah, we're digging into some of the deeper corners of what's going on in places like

21:32.900 --> 21:35.660
WL Roots and other areas of the desktop.

21:35.660 --> 21:40.140
I think what's happening with Silverblue and immutable desktops is really exciting work

21:40.140 --> 21:43.300
and we're working on things in that area as well.

21:43.300 --> 21:50.620
Hotpack and abstracting the application layer from the operating system is another advancement

21:50.620 --> 21:55.860
that I expect us to grow and be more beneficial to users.

21:55.860 --> 21:56.860
Pipewire is exciting.

21:56.860 --> 21:59.900
I hope to get it into Pop soon.

21:59.900 --> 22:05.980
There's an enormous amount of innovation and creativity happening all throughout open source

22:05.980 --> 22:13.140
and it doesn't take much digging to see a lot of creative and exciting things happening.

22:13.140 --> 22:14.660
That's exactly how we feel too.

22:14.660 --> 22:15.980
It's going to be a great year.

22:15.980 --> 22:16.980
Yeah.

22:16.980 --> 22:20.660
This is a really fun time to be a part of the desktop and I'm just excited about what

22:20.660 --> 22:22.940
everyone's working on and where it's all going.

22:22.940 --> 22:25.220
Well, Carl, we're excited about what you're working on.

22:25.220 --> 22:28.580
So thank you to you and the team for another great release and thanks for joining us on

22:28.580 --> 22:29.580
the show.

22:29.580 --> 22:30.580
Thanks for having me.

22:30.580 --> 22:31.580
Appreciate it.

22:31.580 --> 22:32.580
lino.com slash unplugged.

22:32.580 --> 22:38.500
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the

22:38.500 --> 22:39.500
show.

22:39.500 --> 22:41.300
So it's lino.com slash unplugged.

22:41.300 --> 22:44.700
And you guys know that's where we run everything for the last few years.

22:44.700 --> 22:48.900
And part of what drew me in was when I met them at Linux Fest in Texas.

22:48.900 --> 22:52.740
I could tell they were there, they were taking it serious and they were really Linux geeks

22:52.740 --> 22:57.460
and I thought to myself, hmm, I got to try them out sometime.

22:57.460 --> 22:58.820
That's why I tried it really.

22:58.820 --> 23:03.220
And then I discovered, well, they've been around for 18 years and they've really figured

23:03.220 --> 23:04.660
out how to do this right.

23:04.660 --> 23:07.300
And they have stayed competitive like you wouldn't believe.

23:07.300 --> 23:12.420
And now, well, now they're the largest independent cloud provider in the world.

23:12.420 --> 23:15.380
And they've learned that customer support is absolutely critical.

23:15.380 --> 23:19.500
They've invested in being the absolute best in the business.

23:19.500 --> 23:23.200
I got a note from listener Kevin and he said, I've got a $5 Linode, but the support was

23:23.200 --> 23:24.200
great and helpful.

23:24.200 --> 23:25.940
You'd think I had $100 Linode.

23:25.940 --> 23:30.380
I've never seen such expert level customer support on any other cloud provider.

23:30.380 --> 23:32.940
The company really does what they say, he says.

23:32.940 --> 23:38.220
He says, no support tiers, there were no handoffs, only highly trained techs.

23:38.220 --> 23:41.140
And Kevin, you know it now, like when you need that, especially if you're running your

23:41.140 --> 23:44.060
business infrastructure on there, it's so nice to know that's there.

23:44.060 --> 23:48.000
Or even if it's just a project or something you're passionate about, it's great.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.740
And then they have a bunch of easy deployments so you can just get going on an application

23:51.740 --> 23:57.140
like Jitsi or GitLab, or you could build something from the ground up with a great, great resource

23:57.140 --> 23:59.260
of documentation to pull from.

23:59.260 --> 24:02.540
And 11 data centers means there's something close to you or your customers.

24:02.540 --> 24:06.600
They have great features like object storage, cloud firewall backups, and they're all on

24:06.600 --> 24:09.160
top of the log for shelf vulnerability.

24:09.160 --> 24:10.740
They were monitoring it from day one.

24:10.740 --> 24:14.140
They haven't seen any breaches in the entire Linode infrastructure, but their security

24:14.140 --> 24:18.740
team is all over it, watching it like crazy, making sure that your systems are safe and

24:18.740 --> 24:20.980
that the Linode infrastructure is safe.

24:20.980 --> 24:26.460
So go build something, go learn something, and try it for yourself and support the show.

24:26.460 --> 24:31.700
So go to linode.com slash unplugged, get $100 and 60 day credit on a new account, and you

24:31.700 --> 24:33.020
support the show.

24:33.020 --> 24:36.100
It's like voting for Linux Unplugged to stick around a little longer.

24:36.100 --> 24:38.220
Linode.com slash unplugged.

24:38.220 --> 24:45.660
All right, well, now we've got the news straight from the horse's mouth, it's probably time

24:45.660 --> 24:46.700
for our takes.

24:46.700 --> 24:51.940
We've all been playing with the latest Pop OS a bit, but Brent, maybe you should start

24:51.940 --> 24:55.660
things off because as far as I know, Pop OS is new to you, right?

24:55.660 --> 24:59.380
I'm a little embarrassed to say I've never actually sat down and played with it.

24:59.380 --> 25:03.500
I've seen, you know, lots of people, I've looked over a lot of people's shoulders while

25:03.500 --> 25:06.840
they're using it and was always intrigued, but never really got a chance to sit down.

25:06.840 --> 25:09.060
And so this was a perfect opportunity.

25:09.060 --> 25:15.460
And I gotta say, I had fun in the first few minutes, I just part of the graphic design

25:15.460 --> 25:20.460
of it all was just kind of fun and refreshing, which I totally expected from what I've seen

25:20.460 --> 25:21.460
before.

25:21.460 --> 25:22.720
So that's a little thing.

25:22.720 --> 25:29.820
And Wes, you suggested that I try Ventoy to get this going on some actual hardware.

25:29.820 --> 25:31.100
This is a little bit of a sidebar.

25:31.100 --> 25:32.100
Yeah.

25:32.100 --> 25:33.100
Did you give it a try?

25:33.100 --> 25:34.100
I did try Ventoy.

25:34.100 --> 25:36.260
And I don't know how I missed this tool for so many years.

25:36.260 --> 25:38.860
Still writing ISOs by hand like an animal?

25:38.860 --> 25:41.620
Oh, gosh, what have I been doing?

25:41.620 --> 25:44.300
Which cave have I been in?

25:44.300 --> 25:49.880
So for those who don't know, Ventoy is this tiny little tool that you can get and we will

25:49.880 --> 25:56.580
certainly link to it where you just kind of run it and installs a little magic on your

25:56.580 --> 26:01.420
USB drive and then you just drop ISOs in there as many ISOs as you want and you can easily

26:01.420 --> 26:02.420
boot from them.

26:02.420 --> 26:05.780
I don't know why I've been DDing to USB drives for so long.

26:05.780 --> 26:07.320
This is embarrassing.

26:07.320 --> 26:11.140
So Ventoy was an amazing discovery in this kind of pop experience.

26:11.140 --> 26:13.020
So for me, that just started out really nicely.

26:13.020 --> 26:14.140
So thank you too.

26:14.140 --> 26:15.860
I found this little device.

26:15.860 --> 26:17.220
I've talked about it before on the show.

26:17.220 --> 26:22.020
You can probably find it if you go to notes.jupiterbroadcasting.com and search for Ventoy.

26:22.020 --> 26:23.260
But you might love this, Brent.

26:23.260 --> 26:24.820
I almost want to get you one.

26:24.820 --> 26:30.940
What it is, is it's a USB thumb drive, but it's like three, four times the size.

26:30.940 --> 26:36.420
And on one end, it has USB-C and on the other end, it has USB-A. And on the inside, it has

26:36.420 --> 26:39.940
an MVME storage drive that I bought off Amazon.

26:39.940 --> 26:44.000
It's like 256 gigs and super, super, super fast.

26:44.000 --> 26:49.300
So when I use USB-C on like a newer machine, it's unbelievable how quick it is.

26:49.300 --> 26:54.780
And with 256 gigs, I've got like a dozen ISOs on there and still plenty of space to spare.

26:54.780 --> 26:58.120
It's my favorite way to try out distros.

26:58.120 --> 27:02.820
And it's just this combination of the Ventoy software, which gets better and better, and

27:02.820 --> 27:08.140
this little USB device that I could put in a generic MVME drive in, a cheapo one.

27:08.140 --> 27:12.420
And it has C and A. It's such a great setup.

27:12.420 --> 27:16.620
You know, I actually imagine that would pair very well with QuickEMU as well.

27:16.620 --> 27:19.020
Do the little, you know, the little wimpy shuffle.

27:19.020 --> 27:20.700
That would be a nice pairing there.

27:20.700 --> 27:23.300
Do you want to do a VM or do you want to do real hardware?

27:23.300 --> 27:24.300
You got the choice.

27:24.300 --> 27:25.300
It sounds like a great tool.

27:25.300 --> 27:26.360
It actually, it does work.

27:26.360 --> 27:31.740
Like if you just pass in the USB device to QEMU and if you've enabled the EFI stuff,

27:31.740 --> 27:35.380
which QuickEMU helps you do, yeah, it just works.

27:35.380 --> 27:37.260
It's exactly like using it on your actual hardware.

27:37.260 --> 27:40.580
Oh, gentlemen, so much to play with.

27:40.580 --> 27:46.460
So to continue with PopOS, since that was quite the aside, I had a lot of fun at first.

27:46.460 --> 27:47.820
There were a few little things.

27:47.820 --> 27:52.320
I know this was a little bit of a beta that we were playing with, but I had experienced

27:52.320 --> 27:58.180
PopShop for the first time, which people like and some people don't like from what I discovered.

27:58.180 --> 28:02.400
But for me, it seemed like a nice balance of sort of simplicity and choice.

28:02.400 --> 28:07.640
Like Flatpak was super easy to enable and was available in all the searches and stuff,

28:07.640 --> 28:10.620
but it was a tiny bit buggy in my experience.

28:10.620 --> 28:11.620
But it was nice.

28:11.620 --> 28:15.620
I used it exclusively, which is unusual for me, actually, I got to say.

28:15.620 --> 28:21.620
I've been using PopShop exclusively for all of my updates and installs as well, which

28:21.620 --> 28:23.380
is totally unusual behavior for me.

28:23.380 --> 28:26.340
I tend to go to the command line, surprise, surprise.

28:26.340 --> 28:30.700
But talking about power user stuff, did you try out the tiling features?

28:30.700 --> 28:35.100
I wasn't going to because I thought, oh, this is not the kind of a new feature of this particular

28:35.100 --> 28:36.100
release.

28:36.100 --> 28:41.500
I was just in the top right corner there and I remember watching Carl sort of buzz his

28:41.500 --> 28:48.580
way around his own machine when we got the tour at System76 this summer, and that seemed

28:48.580 --> 28:49.580
really great.

28:49.580 --> 28:50.580
So I did dive in.

28:50.580 --> 28:53.180
I'm a total beginner to tiling.

28:53.180 --> 28:58.300
This is the very first time I jump in because I always felt like it was a bit daunting.

28:58.300 --> 29:02.940
I do love keyboard shortcuts and all of that, but it seemed daunting from all of the other

29:02.940 --> 29:06.060
chatter I've seen everywhere about it.

29:06.060 --> 29:10.780
But I knew Pop was doing something maybe a little simpler from it and giving it a shot,

29:10.780 --> 29:17.860
it was, well, I will say I did find a really nice auto tiling tutorial from Pop OS on YouTube.

29:17.860 --> 29:23.540
And that was like, I think it was like a minute and a half long, but didn't ever get me going.

29:23.540 --> 29:25.740
And I got very, very excited about it.

29:25.740 --> 29:30.740
So I think tiling might actually, I could imagine myself sort of falling in love with

29:30.740 --> 29:36.440
it and I may give it more of a go than just this little spin I had.

29:36.440 --> 29:39.740
So that was a really refreshing experience, I got to say.

29:39.740 --> 29:41.380
Have you guys tried its tiling?

29:41.380 --> 29:45.940
I mean, in a past life, I was definitely a tiling window manager user using Awesome,

29:45.940 --> 29:49.180
i3, Xmonad from time to time.

29:49.180 --> 29:51.460
But that's, you know, that's a whole different setup.

29:51.460 --> 29:55.540
You kind of have to get into that mindset and worldview, whereas I really like the balance

29:55.540 --> 29:59.460
that the Pop tiling strikes where I can have just a little tiling.

29:59.460 --> 30:01.700
I don't have to spend a whole bunch of time configuring it.

30:01.700 --> 30:04.660
And for the most part, it just has some reasonable defaults.

30:04.660 --> 30:12.420
Yeah, I would love it if I could just assign some workspaces to tiling and some to free

30:12.420 --> 30:13.420
floating.

30:13.420 --> 30:18.960
Like maybe my main screen is free floating, but my second monitor is tiled or something

30:18.960 --> 30:20.100
like that.

30:20.100 --> 30:24.580
Or workspace one is free floating and workspace two is tiled.

30:24.580 --> 30:29.620
That would be great because the way the way I tend to set up my Linux desktops is workspace

30:29.620 --> 30:39.460
one is maybe a web browser and Kate or G edit and workspace two is slack, telegram, workspace

30:39.460 --> 30:44.420
three is element and discord and workspace four is a terminal.

30:44.420 --> 30:45.420
Right.

30:45.420 --> 30:47.680
And it's just not very efficient as I go down.

30:47.680 --> 30:52.220
The more I increase the workspaces, the less efficient I am about how I arrange them.

30:52.220 --> 30:56.020
Something tells me you really don't like being on workspace number two.

30:56.020 --> 30:59.020
Yeah, pretty much.

30:59.020 --> 31:03.940
And when I'm on plasma, I actually use I'll just I just go all in on the Kwin rules.

31:03.940 --> 31:04.940
Right.

31:04.940 --> 31:06.420
That's how I kind of make it all work.

31:06.420 --> 31:10.380
And it's it's not tiling, but it's at least kind of declarative about where things will

31:10.380 --> 31:11.380
go.

31:11.380 --> 31:16.860
And so for me, I kind of end up leaving the auto tiling off and Pop OS, even though I

31:16.860 --> 31:19.140
it would be perfect for me in some scenarios.

31:19.140 --> 31:24.700
So I what I find fascinating about everything you've said, though, Brent, is you have not

31:24.700 --> 31:29.080
yet once made this a plasma versus gnome thing.

31:29.080 --> 31:33.720
And I'm wondering, because you do live in plasma, I'm wondering how this transition

31:33.720 --> 31:34.720
has been.

31:34.720 --> 31:37.020
Is this a more power user version of gnome for you?

31:37.020 --> 31:40.020
Oh, that is a great exploration.

31:40.020 --> 31:41.020
Hmm.

31:41.020 --> 31:45.220
I think it may be a little early to say, to be honest.

31:45.220 --> 31:49.860
But now that you asked that question, it surprises me that I didn't even think to compare the

31:49.860 --> 31:50.860
two.

31:50.860 --> 31:51.860
Hmm, interesting.

31:51.860 --> 31:55.320
I think maybe I wanted to come at it with really open eyes and not to have some kind

31:55.320 --> 31:58.780
of idea of what it was going to be.

31:58.780 --> 32:00.460
Without expectations, essentially.

32:00.460 --> 32:04.420
Without expectations and without sort of thinking that it wouldn't work for me.

32:04.420 --> 32:08.940
So I approached it as a potential paradigm shift.

32:08.940 --> 32:15.780
Because I also haven't experienced gnome that much in the last, I don't know, four years,

32:15.780 --> 32:16.780
I would say.

32:16.780 --> 32:17.780
Nothing's changed in that time.

32:17.780 --> 32:18.780
Yeah, nothing at all.

32:18.780 --> 32:22.260
And so I thought, well, I should give all of this a try.

32:22.260 --> 32:25.300
And this is the pop OS version of it.

32:25.300 --> 32:29.900
And so I don't have a good reference for what some of the other distributions have as a

32:29.900 --> 32:30.900
base.

32:30.900 --> 32:33.020
But maybe this is the beginning of that discovery.

32:33.020 --> 32:36.700
Well, I think what you kind of touched on here is sort of what the attitude should be

32:36.700 --> 32:38.380
for anybody who's trying Linux.

32:38.380 --> 32:42.560
Like people who are coming from Windows and trying Linux for the first time should try

32:42.560 --> 32:45.880
to take the mindset that you just took when trying out pop for the first time.

32:45.880 --> 32:46.880
It's even more nerdy.

32:46.880 --> 32:50.300
But like, it's the same thing when you're trying, you know, a new tool on the command

32:50.300 --> 32:54.540
line or trying like a new programming language, you got to be willing to accept that you might

32:54.540 --> 32:59.060
have to adopt a different workflow to maximally benefit from some of the things that this

32:59.060 --> 33:02.540
new idea is trying to share with you, even if you ultimately don't end up adopting it

33:02.540 --> 33:03.540
long term.

33:03.540 --> 33:04.540
Right.

33:04.540 --> 33:07.500
And just be open to the idea that maybe there's a few things I learned, and I'll just learn

33:07.500 --> 33:09.060
them in increments.

33:09.060 --> 33:10.520
And then they build on top of each other.

33:10.520 --> 33:14.380
But the other thing you haven't really touched on, and it's the thing I have the most opinion

33:14.380 --> 33:18.460
about, it's that new app menu they have, they have a new app launcher that replaces the

33:18.460 --> 33:20.700
full GNOME overview.

33:20.700 --> 33:24.780
And it's more of a box that comes up in the middle of your screen.

33:24.780 --> 33:27.500
And it has kind of a clear folder system.

33:27.500 --> 33:31.580
So applications, utilities, that kind of stuff are all in their own folders.

33:31.580 --> 33:32.580
All of that's there.

33:32.580 --> 33:36.500
Plus, of course,

33:36.500 --> 33:38.060
You don't say.

33:38.060 --> 33:39.660
It's written in Rust.

33:39.660 --> 33:40.860
Of course.

33:40.860 --> 33:41.860
So what did you think of this?

33:41.860 --> 33:46.360
Well, you know, so I, again, haven't experienced the old app menu.

33:46.360 --> 33:50.660
And so, but all of the excitement about the new app menu, I thought, I got to give this

33:50.660 --> 33:51.660
thing a try.

33:51.660 --> 33:57.660
And I knew the shortcut, you know, super A. And then I wondered what was new about it.

33:57.660 --> 34:01.780
Not because I was comparing it to what was old, but I just thought, oh, this seems essential.

34:01.780 --> 34:05.560
And so I wonder what you guys think, because I didn't have a reference.

34:05.560 --> 34:08.880
And so it just seemed to me like it was an essential piece of software.

34:08.880 --> 34:13.860
And so I, from what I understand, it's different in that it's not full screen anymore.

34:13.860 --> 34:15.960
And they've added some other features.

34:15.960 --> 34:16.960
But can you guys fill me in?

34:16.960 --> 34:18.980
Because I was a little puzzled on this one.

34:18.980 --> 34:23.880
I have to say, I did, I did try it out because, you know, of course, but I'm already so hooked

34:23.880 --> 34:27.820
on like the regular launcher, you know, like not seeing this whole graphical one, but just

34:27.820 --> 34:30.780
the really snappy hit the super key start typing thing.

34:30.780 --> 34:32.100
I'm so sold on that.

34:32.100 --> 34:35.220
I feel like this doesn't really add anything for me as nice as it may be.

34:35.220 --> 34:36.220
Yeah.

34:36.220 --> 34:41.340
So, you know, what's new here is maybe I think what's subtle about the launcher is or it's

34:41.340 --> 34:42.340
not the launcher.

34:42.340 --> 34:46.380
It is an application menu because the launcher is when you hit super key.

34:46.380 --> 34:47.380
This is when you hit super key.

34:47.380 --> 34:54.100
Hey, this is an application selector and application libraries, what they call it.

34:54.100 --> 34:59.520
And to me, it's both the most interesting thing about this release and the most disappointing

34:59.520 --> 35:04.100
thing for me personally, because to me, it has a very utilitarian look.

35:04.100 --> 35:09.420
It kind of just seems sort of a 90s style application launcher, but it does do the essentials.

35:09.420 --> 35:10.420
It lets you find stuff.

35:10.420 --> 35:12.320
It categorizes things very easily.

35:12.320 --> 35:15.960
Things are appropriately spaced out and it launches very fast.

35:15.960 --> 35:21.800
So in terms of like a version one, it checks the minimum viable product that I need.

35:21.800 --> 35:27.560
But it's no K runner and it lacks sort of the elegance that the genome shell launcher

35:27.560 --> 35:30.020
and overview has.

35:30.020 --> 35:36.460
It's an odd area, I feel personally, for system 76 to invest their time because this is an

35:36.460 --> 35:43.180
area that upstream genome shell is actively iterating on and legitimately every single

35:43.180 --> 35:48.920
release for the last year has improved this area of the genome shell.

35:48.920 --> 35:54.340
So if you're going to like innovate somewhere in that space, you're kind of like doing work

35:54.340 --> 35:56.980
that's already getting done for you free upstream.

35:56.980 --> 36:01.700
But I think the difference here is system 76 has a different kind of view of how that

36:01.700 --> 36:02.900
should look.

36:02.900 --> 36:10.380
So with Pop OS now, you have two options up in the top left area of genome shell.

36:10.380 --> 36:14.980
And one option is your typical like overview where you see your workspaces and all of that.

36:14.980 --> 36:19.540
And they've broken out the applications as a second option, or you can hit super A. And

36:19.540 --> 36:24.880
that brings up this application library that's been designed as a relatively small window

36:24.880 --> 36:30.700
on your screen that's very flat, but it has a couple of subtle features that are nice

36:30.700 --> 36:32.100
and you can see maybe where they're going with this.

36:32.100 --> 36:33.980
Like I'll give you an example.

36:33.980 --> 36:38.780
If you've got a multi monitor set up, it's designed in a way that when you open it up

36:38.780 --> 36:42.580
on a workspace, it'll pay attention to where your cursor is and where your active windows

36:42.580 --> 36:48.740
are and it will open up the application library on that screen and then launch the application

36:48.740 --> 36:51.460
that you've chosen on that screen.

36:51.460 --> 36:55.220
And if you have multiple monitors, that's a very, very, very nice feature.

36:55.220 --> 37:00.580
And it does offer some things like that, that I think do bring value.

37:00.580 --> 37:05.580
But overall, I don't know if I were like directing all of the areas I'd like to see improvement.

37:05.580 --> 37:09.900
This would probably not be the area I would, I would spend my resources on because I already

37:09.900 --> 37:14.260
have a launcher, but it is nice to have a place to browse everything that comes up really

37:14.260 --> 37:17.820
quick that you can invoke with the keyboard if you like and all of that.

37:17.820 --> 37:22.340
One other feature that I was looking forward to in the launcher, I called it a launcher,

37:22.340 --> 37:26.700
it's an app menu, was the install suggestions.

37:26.700 --> 37:32.700
I discovered this in openSUSE as KD take where I could just type the application I wanted.

37:32.700 --> 37:37.100
If it wasn't installed, I could just sort of quickly get it installed through the menu,

37:37.100 --> 37:38.100
which was really nice.

37:38.100 --> 37:45.740
And I did see an app suggestions feature in the app menu, but it never presented anything

37:45.740 --> 37:49.300
useful to me, even if I knew those were available to install.

37:49.300 --> 37:51.580
So I don't know if that's a little bug.

37:51.580 --> 37:56.820
Maybe it was just my own issues because it seems like I always run into the weird edge

37:56.820 --> 37:57.820
cases.

37:57.820 --> 38:00.220
But did you guys see anything useful in that area?

38:00.220 --> 38:02.300
I didn't even try that actually.

38:02.300 --> 38:03.300
That's interesting.

38:03.300 --> 38:08.140
I was, I got in a pop shop and I was like, boop, pop, beep, I got everything I needed

38:08.140 --> 38:13.220
on my Pi 400 and Thor bless him if they don't have Slack and Telegram right there when I

38:13.220 --> 38:14.820
open the thing up.

38:14.820 --> 38:16.140
Oh, great.

38:16.140 --> 38:18.380
Like they really do nail some of that stuff.

38:18.380 --> 38:19.380
Yes.

38:19.380 --> 38:23.260
When I put myself in the headspace of a new Linux adopter and I want to get these core

38:23.260 --> 38:24.260
applications, they nail that stuff.

38:24.260 --> 38:28.020
And now we just need Telegram and Slack to finally, you know, actually sync our dark

38:28.020 --> 38:29.020
style preference.

38:29.020 --> 38:32.180
And then there'll be hardly any setup to do on a new system.

38:32.180 --> 38:33.780
But no, I mean, that's that stood out to me.

38:33.780 --> 38:34.780
Just the whole thing.

38:34.780 --> 38:37.720
I mean, I really like I really like the work in the installer.

38:37.720 --> 38:38.720
It's one of my favorite installers.

38:38.720 --> 38:41.240
It just feels like it's a quick process.

38:41.240 --> 38:42.240
It goes smoothly.

38:42.240 --> 38:43.680
It's easy to click through.

38:43.680 --> 38:47.380
And then when you first load it up, you get that that really nice welcome screen.

38:47.380 --> 38:51.620
And it gives you feels like it's one of the most customizable sort of gnomish desktop

38:51.620 --> 38:52.620
experience.

38:52.620 --> 38:53.620
It's not too much.

38:53.620 --> 38:58.180
I don't feel like it's the time I take to get plasma up and going, but it does kind

38:58.180 --> 39:00.980
of let me make the system my own in a nice way.

39:00.980 --> 39:01.980
I agree there.

39:01.980 --> 39:02.980
Yeah.

39:02.980 --> 39:04.240
And they've got some good backgrounds they ship it with.

39:04.240 --> 39:08.220
And that that final setup wizard lets you choose right there at the beginning.

39:08.220 --> 39:10.060
Would you like light mode or dark mode?

39:10.060 --> 39:11.060
Yeah, exactly.

39:11.060 --> 39:16.900
There's also just sort of a snappiness, a modernness, I don't know, you know, we've

39:16.900 --> 39:20.340
been playing with other distros, we play with other package managers, we kind of give apt

39:20.340 --> 39:21.340
a hard time.

39:21.340 --> 39:26.140
And I don't know what it was, but I was the least annoyed with apt that I've been in a

39:26.140 --> 39:27.140
while.

39:27.140 --> 39:28.140
Like it just felt it was snappy enough.

39:28.140 --> 39:29.140
It was getting out of my way.

39:29.140 --> 39:32.260
And part of it probably helped that yeah, like the pop shop actually worked.

39:32.260 --> 39:36.540
It was one of the better experiences that I've had installing a flat pack in a GUI where

39:36.540 --> 39:40.780
it didn't just sort of silently take forever in the background while installed all those,

39:40.780 --> 39:44.240
you know, shared libraries and stuff behind the scenes.

39:44.240 --> 39:45.240
That was really nice.

39:45.240 --> 39:46.240
It just it just worked.

39:46.240 --> 39:47.240
Yeah, that is nice.

39:47.240 --> 39:51.900
But also things like, you know, uses system D boot feels like they've customized just

39:51.900 --> 39:52.900
enough.

39:52.900 --> 39:56.220
They've modernized some of the stuff that I wish that Ubuntu and Debian world would

39:56.220 --> 39:57.220
change.

39:57.220 --> 40:02.860
And it makes it more like a system I might build in the arch world than kind of the stuff

40:02.860 --> 40:07.660
I don't like and wish I could swap out, but don't ever spend the time to on a Debian system.

40:07.660 --> 40:08.660
That's well put.

40:08.660 --> 40:11.780
You also did a little bit of digging into that recovery environment.

40:11.780 --> 40:18.100
Yeah, you know, I've been using Pop OS 2004 as sort of a gaming system.

40:18.100 --> 40:21.980
You know, I do a couple of things on there, but it's really just a pure entertainment

40:21.980 --> 40:22.980
setup.

40:22.980 --> 40:23.980
So I haven't felt the need to update it.

40:23.980 --> 40:26.260
So it's been a little bit since I've checked in with Pop OS.

40:26.260 --> 40:30.420
And when I was installing it, I was like, oh, hey, what what's this recovery partition

40:30.420 --> 40:32.260
that exists now?

40:32.260 --> 40:33.260
And it's it's great.

40:33.260 --> 40:36.940
It's just like a little Casper setup, much like much like the live CD itself.

40:36.940 --> 40:40.860
But they've added some tool into the OS to, you know, make sure things happen like the

40:40.860 --> 40:46.160
restore partition is updated prior to upgrade in the OS and it kind of keeps that all happening

40:46.160 --> 40:50.940
and just means if you want to refresh things, if you need to reinstall from scratch, that's

40:50.940 --> 40:55.860
available even if it didn't come from system 76, just from a clean install, which I don't

40:55.860 --> 41:00.060
know, I probably won't need a ton of even though I was interested technically in like

41:00.060 --> 41:04.380
the nice stuff they've done to make it play nicely with EFI systems in particular.

41:04.380 --> 41:09.860
But if I'm installing this on a friend or a family's PC, that gives me a nice background

41:09.860 --> 41:11.900
sense of, OK, there's a safety net there.

41:11.900 --> 41:15.900
You know, you touched on something there, Wes, that resonated with me.

41:15.900 --> 41:18.380
And I'll take it just a little bit further and I'll say this.

41:18.380 --> 41:20.020
I wish this was Ubuntu.

41:20.020 --> 41:21.820
I wish this was base Ubuntu.

41:21.820 --> 41:22.820
Yeah.

41:22.820 --> 41:26.620
Wouldn't that be great if this was like the baseline and then what Pop was building on

41:26.620 --> 41:30.820
top of was already this good and they could just add more stuff, more value on top of

41:30.820 --> 41:31.820
that?

41:31.820 --> 41:32.820
That's it.

41:32.820 --> 41:35.100
That's that's what I want.

41:35.100 --> 41:41.100
Yeah, it kind of feels like it's the Ubuntu that if they had stayed really excited and

41:41.100 --> 41:44.220
focused on the desktop and we're pushing forward, this would probably be areas they're pushing

41:44.220 --> 41:45.220
on.

41:45.220 --> 41:49.140
And this new application library, it's a good start because if they do want to build their

41:49.140 --> 41:54.500
own environment in the future, it makes sense to get the users familiar with some of these

41:54.500 --> 41:55.500
tools.

41:55.500 --> 41:57.980
Now, we always say this about switching people to Linux, don't we?

41:57.980 --> 42:03.460
Like have them use Firefox and LibreOffice and, you know, tools that they'll use on Linux

42:03.460 --> 42:09.580
like GIMP first, once they get used to those tools, then switch them to Linux.

42:09.580 --> 42:12.140
And then it's only 50 percent of the switch.

42:12.140 --> 42:16.940
And it kind of feels like and I tried to get that out of Carl and he kind of kind of implied

42:16.940 --> 42:22.420
it, but it does feel like some of this stuff is laying the groundwork to get people familiar

42:22.420 --> 42:26.840
with a workflow that will become commonplace when they have their own environment.

42:26.840 --> 42:29.580
And I think an application library like this is a good start.

42:29.580 --> 42:34.060
I just don't really understand why there's a launcher and this because this new application

42:34.060 --> 42:38.720
library launches just as fast as the launcher does.

42:38.720 --> 42:39.840
And of course, it's written in Rust.

42:39.840 --> 42:42.940
So it just seems like it should be the supreme launcher.

42:42.940 --> 42:47.740
And if you wanted to kind of take my criticisms I have about the launcher, like the fact

42:47.740 --> 42:52.580
that it feels a little utilitarian, feels a little bit of Windows 2000, but just in

42:52.580 --> 42:57.220
dark mode, it's functional, and that's my way of saying it's absolutely 100 percent

42:57.220 --> 42:58.220
functional.

42:58.220 --> 42:59.220
It runs fast.

42:59.220 --> 43:01.120
It's not over frilly or anything like that.

43:01.120 --> 43:03.380
It does its core job really well.

43:03.380 --> 43:07.700
But it really feels like because it is one of the very first things you interact with

43:07.700 --> 43:11.960
the Pop OS desktop, it does feel like it sets a tone.

43:11.960 --> 43:15.900
And this is kind of an older workflow, an older environment, a little bit of a more

43:15.900 --> 43:18.140
of a mate experience.

43:18.140 --> 43:22.340
And if you wanted to see something where they're just where they're nailing it, it's over on

43:22.340 --> 43:23.340
the Mac side.

43:23.340 --> 43:24.940
Actually, I hear about this from developers on Coda Radio.

43:24.940 --> 43:26.820
It's called Raycast.

43:26.820 --> 43:29.920
It's an app launcher and it's good looking.

43:29.920 --> 43:32.160
It has a super powerful feature set.

43:32.160 --> 43:33.540
The hype is so real.

43:33.540 --> 43:34.540
Get this.

43:34.540 --> 43:44.060
A fricking app launcher on the Mac just got 15 million dollars in VC funding, but yeah,

43:44.060 --> 43:46.380
people really care about this stuff.

43:46.380 --> 43:49.940
And that's for a platform, by the way, that comes with Spotlight.

43:49.940 --> 43:53.400
That is an app launcher built in, right?

43:53.400 --> 43:56.160
So people really care about this app launcher stuff.

43:56.160 --> 43:59.980
And what I feel like what we have right now is kind of like this weird hybrid where there's

43:59.980 --> 44:03.740
two components, the application library and the launcher.

44:03.740 --> 44:09.140
And they're both extremely functional, but neither one of them feels particularly graphically

44:09.140 --> 44:10.140
innovative.

44:10.140 --> 44:14.220
And it doesn't have to be blow away, but it'd be nice to have it feel a little more modern.

44:14.220 --> 44:18.180
One thing I like about the older launcher now, I guess, is that it's at least minimal,

44:18.180 --> 44:21.600
you know, and to some extent that's what I want in a launcher is like just like barely

44:21.600 --> 44:24.540
notice it because it's so fast and it just gets out of my way and it launches the thing

44:24.540 --> 44:25.860
that I want that I'm less concerned.

44:25.860 --> 44:29.180
But you're right, like when it starts taking up as in the application version, when it

44:29.180 --> 44:33.020
takes up more of your screen, having it look pleasing probably gets more important.

44:33.020 --> 44:37.960
Yeah, it just makes it also makes the desktop environment feel like it's more modern.

44:37.960 --> 44:42.700
And when it feels more modern, it feels like it's well engineered.

44:42.700 --> 44:46.240
And when it's well engineered, I think, well, if the OS is well engineered, then I bet those

44:46.240 --> 44:49.620
desktop machines are well engineered or those laptops are well engineered, right?

44:49.620 --> 44:51.440
So it kind of all connects together.

44:51.440 --> 44:55.300
But I tried it on my Pi 400.

44:55.300 --> 45:00.540
And that's an interesting experience, because I also tried this on an older Intel PC that

45:00.540 --> 45:03.580
a listener Mike had sent in to for us that I use for testing.

45:03.580 --> 45:07.780
And it's an older Xeon with spinning rest disks.

45:07.780 --> 45:10.680
And it's a perfectly usable machine.

45:10.680 --> 45:15.860
If you remember how slow it was to use spinning rest, that's what it feels like the Pi 400.

45:15.860 --> 45:21.740
And I'm running off of a USB SSD, not an SD card, but it's usable.

45:21.740 --> 45:24.400
And it's perfectly usable as a work machine.

45:24.400 --> 45:31.100
And I'm talking fully up to date Pop OS, right 2110 with the latest Linux 15.5 kernel, latest

45:31.100 --> 45:32.240
GNOME 40.

45:32.240 --> 45:35.960
And I'm using it on a Pi 400, which is a keyboard.

45:35.960 --> 45:37.880
And I've set it up to do my email.

45:37.880 --> 45:40.620
It's got my browser profiles on there, my SSH keys.

45:40.620 --> 45:46.020
I like to have this Pi 400 as like my go-to, something's not right with my main machine.

45:46.020 --> 45:51.520
Maybe I'm trying some distro or maybe I didn't remember to bring my laptop or whatever, right?

45:51.520 --> 45:55.700
Like I just have a machine here at the studio that I can get work done on.

45:55.700 --> 45:56.700
And it's great for that.

45:56.700 --> 46:00.820
And in fact, for some reason, that application library concept almost feels like it works

46:00.820 --> 46:05.980
better on that little 1080p display I have connected to my Raspberry Pi 400.

46:05.980 --> 46:11.500
Like as the constraints got tighter, the innovations they've done here in 2110 actually felt like

46:11.500 --> 46:13.580
they paid more dividends.

46:13.580 --> 46:15.380
And like, why waste time with a big screen takeover?

46:15.380 --> 46:17.980
Well, that's an interesting environment to challenge it, yeah.

46:17.980 --> 46:19.460
Yeah, it pushed it, right?

46:19.460 --> 46:20.460
So I like it there.

46:20.460 --> 46:21.920
I think I'm going to leave it on the Pi 400.

46:21.920 --> 46:27.140
But the one thing I'd love to see from Pop OS is I'd love to see them put out a full

46:27.140 --> 46:32.680
fledged ARM ISO image presently, and this is common for a lot of distros, you download

46:32.680 --> 46:39.220
a pre-built image and you flash it to an SD card or a USB SSD in my case.

46:39.220 --> 46:43.740
Then you boot off of it and if you're lucky, they'll have a first time setup wizard at

46:43.740 --> 46:45.940
first boot like Pop OS does.

46:45.940 --> 46:48.100
And you set up a user account and all that stuff's fine.

46:48.100 --> 46:53.140
But I and a lot of other Pi users are actually beginning to transition to the Compute Module

46:53.140 --> 46:56.260
4 with a built in eMMC.

46:56.260 --> 47:01.980
And it has been so great for distros like OpenSUSE at Tumbleweed where I can just boot

47:01.980 --> 47:08.180
from a standard ISO image and I run through the standard installer and I select the eMMC

47:08.180 --> 47:14.180
like a regular disk and then I have what feels like a fully clean install, safer, fresher,

47:14.180 --> 47:15.180
totally mine, right?

47:15.180 --> 47:20.280
When I flash an image to an SD card or to a hard drive, I feel like I'm booting into

47:20.280 --> 47:24.620
somebody else's install, like I'm using somebody else's computer and I'm adding my account

47:24.620 --> 47:25.620
on top of it.

47:25.620 --> 47:30.620
I know it's probably not much technically different, but I would rather just install

47:30.620 --> 47:34.500
on my ARM devices like I install on all my x86 devices.

47:34.500 --> 47:36.640
But I need an actual ISO to do that, not an image file.

47:36.640 --> 47:38.100
But it is nice to have an image file.

47:38.100 --> 47:43.140
And the reality is with Linux 5.15 baked in there now, they're at a point where a lot

47:43.140 --> 47:48.860
of the upstream drivers for the 400 and the Pi 4 and the Pi 3 and a lot of other ARM devices

47:48.860 --> 47:51.140
are just built in now.

47:51.140 --> 47:54.480
You don't have to have like a specific image with weirdo patches anymore.

47:54.480 --> 47:58.000
So hopefully we'll see that transition in the future because I plan to keep testing

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
on ARM.

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
Yeah, that's just it.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.920
I mean, we're finally in this world where you can have this more traditional behavior

48:02.920 --> 48:05.460
we got used to on x86 in the ARM world.

48:05.460 --> 48:09.580
And OK, yeah, even if it's not strictly necessary, it's so fun to play with.

48:09.580 --> 48:10.580
It's true.

48:10.580 --> 48:15.300
A couple of things to cover before we get out of here.

48:15.300 --> 48:17.540
The Tuxes are next week.

48:17.540 --> 48:20.100
This is our second to last live episode on a Tuesday.

48:20.100 --> 48:24.500
So if you'd like to join us on a Tuesday next week and the week after are your last chances.

48:24.500 --> 48:25.500
And then it's Sundays.

48:25.500 --> 48:30.220
I also want to say thank you to our members over at UnpluggedCore.com.

48:30.220 --> 48:34.220
This week in particular, some of the best bits are actually in the live member stream.

48:34.220 --> 48:35.220
They're not making it into the show.

48:35.220 --> 48:36.940
We've had to do we had to do an intermission this week.

48:36.940 --> 48:38.380
It happens sometimes.

48:38.380 --> 48:40.300
Our members get that content.

48:40.300 --> 48:43.660
The shows now also offer a totally ad free feed.

48:43.660 --> 48:47.540
So if you'd like a version of the show with absolutely zero ads, that's now available

48:47.540 --> 48:48.820
to our members.

48:48.820 --> 48:54.060
And we have launched a network membership.

48:54.060 --> 48:57.440
It's been some work, but it's here and it's a Jupiter.party.

48:57.440 --> 49:03.060
Every member benefit, every ad free feed, the bonus content from the show from self

49:03.060 --> 49:04.900
hosted from Kota Radio.

49:04.900 --> 49:08.020
It's now available for just the price of two show memberships.

49:08.020 --> 49:11.740
But if you sign up before the end of the month, I'm taking two dollars off for a year.

49:11.740 --> 49:12.740
Jupiter.party.

49:12.740 --> 49:17.180
You can also give the gift of a Jupiter broadcasting membership that's over Jupiter party.

49:17.180 --> 49:23.260
Jupiter.party, you know, Jupiter dot something super expensive except for a couple of them

49:23.260 --> 49:24.620
and dot party was one of them.

49:24.620 --> 49:25.620
So how could I not?

49:25.620 --> 49:26.620
So it's Jupiter.party.

49:26.620 --> 49:27.620
Why?

49:27.620 --> 49:32.660
Because it was a great deal on Namecheap.

49:32.660 --> 49:37.560
As you might expect, hearing from you, our dear audience is a big part of where we get

49:37.560 --> 49:45.300
topic ideas, find out what you like or really don't like and all the cool projects and software

49:45.300 --> 49:48.980
and services that you're following these days.

49:48.980 --> 49:55.500
And this week, Paul wrote in picking up on the Slackware topic from last episode, I really

49:55.500 --> 49:56.500
enjoyed episode 435.

49:56.500 --> 49:59.500
It was nice to hear Slackware being mentioned.

49:59.500 --> 50:05.540
However, I was a bit shocked that everybody thought Slackware was only updated half a

50:05.540 --> 50:06.540
decade ago.

50:06.540 --> 50:12.600
In fact, it's a lesser known secret that there's another version of Slack hiding in plain sight.

50:12.600 --> 50:14.820
It's called Slackware current.

50:14.820 --> 50:20.960
It's a bleeding edge rolling release that's updated several times a day.

50:20.960 --> 50:25.220
Most Slack users are actually running this as we have the latest stable kernels, plasma

50:25.220 --> 50:30.300
on Wayland, pipe wire, and all the new goodies like WireGuard are easily accessible with

50:30.300 --> 50:31.620
packages.

50:31.620 --> 50:35.920
Switching from 14.2 to current is pretty easy as well, you just modify some stuff in Etsy

50:35.920 --> 50:39.220
and then run a normal system update.

50:39.220 --> 50:43.540
And despite it being a rolling release, well, in typical Slackware style, it's still more

50:43.540 --> 50:48.060
stable and bug-free than the majority of long-term releases in those other distributions.

50:48.060 --> 50:54.520
In fact, I always upgrade Mila nodes from 14.2 to current since it makes a super solid

50:54.520 --> 50:56.700
and reliable server OS.

50:56.700 --> 51:02.820
But with all the benefit of the latest toys, it still makes a great desktop OS as well.

51:02.820 --> 51:08.580
And while on that topic of updates, when Patrick's ready, he'll take the latest current as 15.0,

51:08.580 --> 51:10.140
seems due out quite soon.

51:10.140 --> 51:14.540
So is he saying, like, he's using Slack rolling, essentially, is that what I'm hearing?

51:14.540 --> 51:15.540
That's what I heard.

51:15.540 --> 51:20.820
I mean, gosh, I didn't really realize and yeah, maybe we missed this option in our server

51:20.820 --> 51:21.820
poll.

51:21.820 --> 51:22.820
Yeah.

51:22.820 --> 51:24.780
Wouldn't that have been funny to run that as one of our server OSs?

51:24.780 --> 51:28.840
I knew Slackware got updated more than a decade, but I didn't really appreciate that there's

51:28.840 --> 51:30.580
more of a Slackware current.

51:30.580 --> 51:35.180
Although I would not be surprised to learn that Slackware's current is a little bit different

51:35.180 --> 51:37.860
than my definition of current.

51:37.860 --> 51:41.060
I think there's only one way to find out, Chris.

51:41.060 --> 51:42.060
You're right.

51:42.060 --> 51:44.700
Hmm, perhaps a future episode with.

51:44.700 --> 51:47.140
Staying with the Slackware for one more email.

51:47.140 --> 51:51.860
Tristan wrote in with a nod to our nod to Slackware.

51:51.860 --> 51:56.940
A long time ago when Windows support for friends and family frayed my last nerve and Macs were

51:56.940 --> 52:03.580
strange and exotic beasts I couldn't afford, I decided to build my first Linux machine.

52:03.580 --> 52:08.220
With all popular advice and with an abundance of overconfidence, I opted for Slackware as

52:08.220 --> 52:10.020
my distro of choice.

52:10.020 --> 52:13.220
This went as well as you might expect for a noob.

52:13.220 --> 52:18.060
Within an hour, I'd found that my video card modules weren't updated in the bundled Slack

52:18.060 --> 52:24.300
kernel, stumbled my way through a kernel upgrade, got my first taste of Toben C. Hell, then

52:24.300 --> 52:26.940
rendered my system unbootable.

52:26.940 --> 52:32.060
Within the next few hours, I'd been introduced to Lilo and Xorg.com.

52:32.060 --> 52:36.900
As frustrating as all of that sounds, the ability to delve deep into the workings of

52:36.900 --> 52:44.500
my OS, adapt it to my needs, and with a careless typo break it entirely, hooked me for life.

52:44.500 --> 52:48.460
Eventually the package management limitations, depths of dependency hell, and badly mucked

52:48.460 --> 52:52.460
up file system mess I had created led me to move on.

52:52.460 --> 52:58.260
While I don't see any reason besides masochism and nostalgia to ever go back, I will forever

52:58.260 --> 53:03.260
be grateful to Slackware for forcing me to learn the basic fundamentals of the Linux

53:03.260 --> 53:04.260
architecture.

53:04.260 --> 53:09.860
They are lessons that have served me well in every distro since, and a forced deep dive

53:09.860 --> 53:14.620
gave me a lifetime passion for the open source concept, community, and the incredible OS

53:14.620 --> 53:16.300
it has spawned.

53:16.300 --> 53:20.700
It sounds like last week we heard a little bit, and even this week, that that's not an

53:20.700 --> 53:26.820
uncommon situation for those who were lucky enough to try Slackware in its heyday, and

53:26.820 --> 53:29.700
I just thought this was a nice nod to that.

53:29.700 --> 53:35.080
Yeah, you know what I connected with Tristan's story there was a lot of what Tristan explained

53:35.080 --> 53:38.540
about Slackware, I would say happened with me, but Gentoo.

53:38.540 --> 53:43.080
I learned so much about Lilo and Xorg with Gentoo, and I learned so much about how file

53:43.080 --> 53:47.060
partitioning works and stuff by doing Gentoo.

53:47.060 --> 53:49.540
I always very fondly think of Gentoo in that way.

53:49.540 --> 53:54.420
It forced me to learn the basic fundamental Linux architecture, just like Slackware did

53:54.420 --> 53:56.060
for them.

53:56.060 --> 53:57.220
I love that, Tristan.

53:57.220 --> 54:03.020
I think that exactly connects with my experience there, but just one branch over, because Slackware

54:03.020 --> 54:07.420
was around when I began Linux in my time, but there was other options at that point.

54:07.420 --> 54:11.540
I think I'd argue Arch is that kind of similar experience for many as well.

54:11.540 --> 54:14.860
I don't know if it's quite as much of a deep dive, you guys would know more than that than

54:14.860 --> 54:21.480
I would, but certainly it has you knee deep in some technical stuff and learning, so that

54:21.480 --> 54:22.660
seems like a nice approach too.

54:22.660 --> 54:26.460
Yeah, I suppose it just depends on how deep you go down that rabbit hole, and you hear

54:26.460 --> 54:29.300
that too about Linux from scratch and that kind of stuff as well.

54:29.300 --> 54:34.780
They're great learning opportunities, almost from a computer sciency standpoint, not necessarily

54:34.780 --> 54:39.420
even just from a learn Linux standpoint, although you will absolutely do that, but along the

54:39.420 --> 54:43.100
way you'll also learn a little bit about how computers work, and I do feel like that's

54:43.100 --> 54:44.100
pretty super valuable.

54:44.100 --> 54:45.740
We've got to keep moving on.

54:45.740 --> 54:46.980
We're going long here.

54:46.980 --> 54:54.220
We have a last minute pick, and I got to assume this is a Westpain pick because, well, I'll

54:54.220 --> 54:59.220
read the description and then I think it'll be obvious, quote, this app uses WebRTC to

54:59.220 --> 55:03.020
stream a desktop inside of a Docker container.

55:03.020 --> 55:07.980
Yeah, this has been floating around for a bit, but it looks like there's been a few

55:07.980 --> 55:13.180
of these, and in particular Neko here has been revived, maintainership taken over by

55:13.180 --> 55:14.180
a new user.

55:14.180 --> 55:17.220
I just thought maybe we could highlight it because it seems super flexible.

55:17.220 --> 55:21.780
Maybe we could use it in an OBS type setup, or if you're just trying to hang out with

55:21.780 --> 55:27.100
remote friends and you want to watch something together, this could be a good option.

55:27.100 --> 55:31.140
There's a lot of stuff here, but what stands out to me about Neko is, A, it's just very

55:31.140 --> 55:34.220
smooth, but it's got chat built in, it's got emotes built in.

55:34.220 --> 55:38.380
It just seems very sophisticated and easy to get started with.

55:38.380 --> 55:39.380
Yeah, fair enough.

55:39.380 --> 55:44.300
I was thinking for this, Wes, if you were somebody who frequently recorded tutorials,

55:44.300 --> 55:48.340
how-to kind of videos, and you wanted a clean setup that you could work out of and then

55:48.340 --> 55:53.260
after you're done with the video, just kind of destroy it, like maybe you've used a VM

55:53.260 --> 55:55.500
for traditionally, you could probably use this, right?

55:55.500 --> 56:00.140
The nice thing is, with a WebRTC stream, I don't know for sure, but I would imagine there's

56:00.140 --> 56:04.180
a pretty straightforward way to capture that into OBS for recording that kind of thing.

56:04.180 --> 56:06.520
I would think so.

56:06.520 --> 56:10.780
It also seems nice just for, you know, we've talked about Jellyfin being able to do streaming.

56:10.780 --> 56:13.900
There's some sort of custom sites out there that'll do it just for YouTube or just for

56:13.900 --> 56:19.060
Netflix or some of the other big popular platforms, but this is kind of a nice hack using a bunch

56:19.060 --> 56:24.180
of different technologies we talk about that lets you do this for basically any website.

56:24.180 --> 56:29.460
Neko will have a link in the show notes so that way you can go see their logo with excessive

56:29.460 --> 56:30.460
cat butt.

56:30.460 --> 56:34.820
Oh gosh, I can't help but notice that the cat is very well rendered.

56:34.820 --> 56:38.180
That's a very accurate, I will just say, it's a treat.

56:38.180 --> 56:43.940
You're not going to forget that logo, you know, you're not, absolutely.

56:43.940 --> 56:47.300
If you'd like more show, remember there is the Luplug, it gets together every single

56:47.300 --> 56:51.600
Sunday at noon and when the show moves to Sundays, there's still going to be a get together

56:51.600 --> 56:56.100
happening there because we won't really be live until about 12, 31 o'clock on Sundays.

56:56.100 --> 57:00.700
The pre-pre-show is going to happen in the virtual lug and we'll also have an event happening

57:00.700 --> 57:01.700
on Tuesdays.

57:01.700 --> 57:07.160
So there's more opportunity than ever to participate in that virtual lug and chat with like-minded

57:07.160 --> 57:10.660
Linux users, ask questions, share experiences.

57:10.660 --> 57:15.240
It's a pretty fun experience and you can get details on how to join that at linuxunplug.com

57:15.240 --> 57:16.480
slash mumble.

57:16.480 --> 57:20.900
And if you are in the tech industry, do not miss Linux action news.

57:20.900 --> 57:24.460
You got to stay current on this stuff because Linux touches so much of what we do in the

57:24.460 --> 57:25.780
tech industry now.

57:25.780 --> 57:30.160
So even if you're not a daily Linux driver, I think it's pretty essential you stay current

57:30.160 --> 57:34.620
on what's going on in the world of Linux and we do that at linuxactionnews.com.

57:34.620 --> 57:37.420
But we will be back for a couple of more Tuesdays.

57:37.420 --> 57:38.420
See you next week.

57:38.420 --> 57:41.340
Same bad time, same bad station.

57:41.340 --> 57:43.260
That's right.

57:43.260 --> 57:50.380
So while it lasts, join us noon Pacific on a Tuesday at jblive.tv and then links to everything

57:50.380 --> 57:52.860
we talked about today, how to contact us.

57:52.860 --> 57:54.460
That's a big part of the show.

57:54.460 --> 58:00.060
Our mumble info, our matrix info, including our new cryptocurrency matrix room.

58:00.060 --> 58:01.060
Yeah, I did it.

58:01.060 --> 58:02.060
I did it.

58:02.060 --> 58:04.240
I admit it.

58:04.240 --> 58:05.740
That's all over there.

58:05.740 --> 58:09.020
Or you can join colony.jupitabroadcasting.com.

58:09.020 --> 58:15.240
But thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Linux Unplugged program.

58:15.240 --> 58:30.980
And for at least a little bit longer, we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

58:45.240 --> 59:02.760
All right, I need the chat room and everybody watching live to go boat over at JBtitles.com.

59:02.760 --> 59:08.060
And then if you guys would just allow for a second, we're going to have a little powwow.

59:08.060 --> 59:12.340
Brent, Wes, if you guys could just come over here just just for a second.

59:12.340 --> 59:15.580
The Cone of Silence.

59:15.580 --> 59:16.580
Not the code again.

59:16.580 --> 59:19.780
I love the code.

59:19.780 --> 59:22.180
Well, I've gone and done it.

59:22.180 --> 59:25.020
I'm going to scratch you guys know I'm going to scratch this new Linux show we're working

59:25.020 --> 59:26.020
on.

59:26.020 --> 59:27.900
I'm just going to punt it for now.

59:27.900 --> 59:29.300
I don't think we're there.

59:29.300 --> 59:33.360
Yeah, I don't think brunch with Chris was very good title anyway.

59:33.360 --> 59:36.780
And I don't have the new servers hooked up yet as of right now.

59:36.780 --> 59:40.460
And I don't know if we're going to run into issues with the storage controllers.

59:40.460 --> 59:42.780
I don't know if we're going to run into any issues with the disks.

59:42.780 --> 59:45.340
There could be a bad disk because we bought them used.

59:45.340 --> 59:47.860
I don't even have a spot cleared out in the garage yet.

59:47.860 --> 59:52.500
So I'm kind of freaking out just a little bit because the holidays are approaching.

59:52.500 --> 59:56.260
So I figured we got to let something go right.

59:56.260 --> 59:59.100
We got to make we got to make a concession somewhere.

59:59.100 --> 01:00:03.900
And I feel like I just I had to let I got a punt on the new show so we can focus on

01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:06.700
luck and we can focus on the server stuff.

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:10.820
Is that new show like permanently canceled or is it just getting moved down the line

01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:13.240
a few weeks or months or whatever?

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:14.700
I don't know yet.

01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:18.100
So I'm either going to I'm either going to move it down the line, which is my first line

01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:24.820
of thinking, or I'm going to take what we were going to do and I might try to integrate

01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:27.740
it into a little bit into land and a little bit into love.

01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:28.820
I don't know.

01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:35.500
It feels like honestly, we got enough podcasts at this point and I I could just kind of channel

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:37.200
that into what we already do.

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:39.860
But I have not figured that out yet.

01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:41.860
This is what I did is I don't know how it happened.

01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:43.900
I think it's because I'm a dumb person.

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:49.940
But like I just kept on pretending like the holidays weren't a thing and just sort of

01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:53.980
like bit off more than I could chew thinking, well, I'll just work through this, right?

01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:54.980
It's October.

01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:55.980
How hard could it be?

01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:56.980
Yeah.

01:00:56.980 --> 01:00:57.980
Then you forget.

01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:00.820
Oh, wait, no, there's a whole bunch of other stuff that's about to come up.

01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:01.820
Yeah.

01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:07.060
I'm really lucky that this show and I don't think land either land on an actual holiday

01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:08.060
like that.

01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:09.100
That is rare.

01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:10.100
That's very unusual.

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:11.100
Yeah.

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:12.100
Yeah.

01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:14.300
So I think we're just you know, we're just going to do, you know, business as usual and

01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:15.620
then we'll move to the Sunday.

01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:21.620
But oof, I feel bad about it because I was pretty excited about the idea and the concept.

01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:22.620
So we'll see.

01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:23.620
We'll see what happens.

01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:27.180
Maybe it's a cue like you one, maybe early Q2 thing.

01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:30.900
I have another show I also want to do in the meantime, so we'll see what happens.

01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:32.300
I got a couple of ideas going on right now.

01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:38.140
It's been a little bit, but you know, it's been almost 16 months since we went independent.

01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:39.140
Wow.

01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:40.140
Yeah.

01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:43.060
We're just like 15.5 months into it right now.

01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:44.480
Pretty awesome.

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:50.700
And so I'm you know, the first bit was really like survive and transition from being an

01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:56.060
employee to running a business and like trying to keep while all the shows right, like without

01:01:56.060 --> 01:02:00.660
missing a week and trying to get all of that figured out and then figuring out how to like

01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:03.820
the income going so I can actually get paid because like for the first four months or

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:06.260
five months, I didn't make a dime.

01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:09.820
And then like trying to just kind of figure out how to make it sustainable.

01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:15.740
And now I'm at the point now where I'm thinking, OK, where do we want to go?

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:17.620
What's the next 10 years look like?

01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:21.020
What's the next big trends in open source and free software and that kind of stuff?

01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:23.240
And that's a really good place to be at.

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:29.300
But it also means that I have to choose wisely because we have limited time, limited resources

01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:30.820
and limited finances.

01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:34.660
And so while there's like a million options now available to me, I really have to be careful

01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:35.660
about it.

01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:39.680
And so that's why I'm just waiting for a little bit, because honestly, if I can make the existing

01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:46.080
shows better, that may actually be my first preference and then look at what remains,

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:49.940
what is still uncovered and then see if there's a space for a show that I think is going to

01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:50.940
be my approach.

01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:55.140
I also think we'd always rather do something well than quickly.

01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:56.140
Right.

01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:58.940
And so that has kind of been our philosophy for a long time.

01:02:58.940 --> 01:02:59.940
You've taught me that, Chris.

01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:05.080
And so I think it's probably a great idea to push a little bit and see where it goes

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:08.300
and see how we grow from now to then.

01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:09.300
Yeah.

01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:13.020
I also kind of feel like one of the things that's holding back how much we can get done

01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:15.940
is we're all remote.

01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:21.960
And so if I had like what I really need is I need to not be the person who's like making

01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:23.220
infrastructure things happens.

01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:25.100
I shouldn't because I'm also the CEO.

01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:28.900
I'm also the editor in chief and I'm also the host on most of the shows, I probably

01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:34.060
shouldn't be the person who's like clearing space, moving servers, wiring them and getting

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:35.060
the OS installed.

01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:36.060
Right.

01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:39.220
Like, I want to be, but I shouldn't be.

01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:44.020
If our team was all in Seattle, if all of us were here, somebody, one of us would be

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:48.180
working on the server right now, like one of us, because that's that's how we are right.

01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:51.700
But because nobody, it's just me here and Wes here.

01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:56.060
It's like we're we're spending a lot of plates already, so the server is just not happening.

01:03:56.060 --> 01:04:01.200
What I what I need is like another set of hands that can just help with some of these

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:05.420
things like getting the server hooked up, getting the OS installed, that kind of stuff.

01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:11.320
And so many times, I think I wish there was like a listener in the area that had time

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:13.820
to spare that wanted to do this stuff.

01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:19.700
But because the audience is so spread out, there's dozens of us everywhere, but we're

01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:24.260
just spread out enough that we don't kind of have that magic that happens when multiple

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:28.380
people that have the same idea and the same goals are working in the same place.

01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:32.620
We get it every now and then, and we've done sprints in the past and we'll do sprints in

01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:33.620
the future.

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:35.660
And that we've seen that really happens, right?

01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:37.700
That's where self-hosted came from.

01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:40.840
The last JB Sprint, self-hosted was born.

01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:42.680
Like things come from that.

01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:47.920
But with the Rona and the budget, it's just it's at a slower pace.

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:52.760
And so here I am, I'm still balancing how I operate this thing.

01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:57.820
Because honestly, for me, doing the shows is a full-time job and anything that happens

01:04:57.820 --> 01:05:03.100
outside of the show productions and content preparation is bonus.

01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:08.100
The irony is that means running the business, sponsor stuff, taking care of infrastructures.

01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:12.740
It's so much extra stuff that it's a slow pace.

01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:16.860
And I kind of backed myself into a corner because this hardware is dying out in the

01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:17.860
garage.

01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:19.820
So we got to get swapped over.

01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:23.420
We got to move before it dies because we all know it's on its last legs.

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:24.420
Oh, good.

01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:26.580
Optimus is going to just mail us a clone of West.

01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:28.660
Well, actually, that's great.

01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:30.000
Thank you.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Problem solved.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.660
Yeah, we tried that already, but it came out evil.

01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:36.460
It was rough.

01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:37.460
Yeah.

01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:38.460
You know what?

01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:52.660
You chose the goatee option every time you choose the goatee.
