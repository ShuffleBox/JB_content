WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.400
Yara.io? What do you think, Wes?

00:02.400 --> 00:03.240
Yara.io?

00:03.240 --> 00:04.080
Yaro!

00:04.080 --> 00:06.540
What, no, you're, no.

00:06.540 --> 00:08.000
But this does look pretty cool,

00:08.000 --> 00:11.640
and it's yet another Raspberry Pi handheld device.

00:11.640 --> 00:14.720
This one takes advantage of the Raspberry Pi OS,

00:14.720 --> 00:16.720
it just uses their OS.

00:16.720 --> 00:19.720
It's a handheld that I'd say hearkens back

00:19.720 --> 00:23.260
to the Game Boy 3DS Flip-style device,

00:23.260 --> 00:25.660
but it has a full-corded keyboard and a trackpad,

00:25.660 --> 00:28.500
so it's slightly larger.

00:28.500 --> 00:31.360
Let's just say rugged and durable.

00:31.360 --> 00:33.740
Yeah, it does have very much like you could take this

00:33.740 --> 00:35.940
to a construction site kind of look to it.

00:35.940 --> 00:39.700
It's got a five-inch resistive touchscreen

00:39.700 --> 00:41.740
that runs at 800 by 480,

00:41.740 --> 00:43.080
and they say the display actually has

00:43.080 --> 00:45.420
pretty decent color representation.

00:45.420 --> 00:46.540
With the keyboard on there, you know,

00:46.540 --> 00:48.580
you could type out into an SSH session,

00:48.580 --> 00:50.280
you can run XFCE on this thing,

00:50.280 --> 00:53.180
you get access to the Pi's GPIO connection,

00:53.180 --> 00:55.660
so you could hook it up to devices on the go.

00:55.660 --> 00:57.820
And it's kind of neat how they've wired it all together.

00:57.820 --> 00:59.420
It looks, when you open it up,

00:59.420 --> 01:01.300
the way they've integrated the battery and the wiring

01:01.300 --> 01:03.360
and all of that, it really looks like

01:03.360 --> 01:04.660
a legit consumer product.

01:04.660 --> 01:06.360
Yeah, right, and at the same time,

01:06.360 --> 01:08.200
they've spent a bunch of work on hackability,

01:08.200 --> 01:09.900
making sure that, like, you can actually source

01:09.900 --> 01:12.840
every single component, no custom PCBs,

01:12.840 --> 01:15.000
and just a bit of soldering required,

01:15.000 --> 01:16.440
which, that's pretty cool.

01:16.440 --> 01:19.820
Little bit of soldering, maybe 15 hours of labor.

01:19.820 --> 01:21.420
That's all it takes.

01:21.420 --> 01:33.420
Hello, friends, and welcome to 370

01:33.420 --> 01:35.220
of your weekly Linux talk show.

01:35.220 --> 01:36.160
My name is Chris.

01:36.160 --> 01:37.260
My name is Wes.

01:37.260 --> 01:40.440
Wes, I love it when we hit, like, the 10 mark,

01:40.440 --> 01:42.600
you know, the new, when we click over, love it.

01:42.600 --> 01:43.980
Just feels right.

01:43.980 --> 01:45.440
It feels like we did something,

01:45.440 --> 01:47.540
even though it's totally arbitrary.

01:47.540 --> 01:48.380
Thanks, math.

01:48.380 --> 01:51.680
Well, also, I want to say thank you to a Cloud Guru

01:51.680 --> 01:53.480
for sponsoring this episode of Unplugged.

01:53.480 --> 01:56.380
So many career possibilities in the cloud, so little time.

01:56.380 --> 01:59.260
ACG's learning paths help you take the right courses

01:59.260 --> 02:02.220
to prepare for architects or developers, security jobs,

02:02.220 --> 02:04.320
and many other high-paying cloud jobs.

02:04.320 --> 02:08.100
Get hired, get certified, get learning at cloud.guru.

02:08.100 --> 02:10.400
Also, hello there to Drew.

02:10.400 --> 02:11.340
Welcome back in.

02:11.340 --> 02:12.400
Hello, hello.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.340
Hi, Drew, did you finish up the sausage,

02:14.340 --> 02:16.100
or are you still munching on that over there?

02:16.100 --> 02:18.500
Eh, no, I'm done with it for now.

02:18.500 --> 02:20.680
Did you bring enough for the class?

02:20.680 --> 02:22.240
Just under the wire.

02:22.240 --> 02:24.120
Too bad you guys aren't here in person today,

02:24.120 --> 02:27.920
because I'm rocking a blazer today.

02:27.920 --> 02:28.920
Mm.

02:28.920 --> 02:29.760
A blazer.

02:29.760 --> 02:31.980
I can hear how fancy you sound just in the voice.

02:31.980 --> 02:32.820
Right?

02:32.820 --> 02:34.060
It's the shoulder pads.

02:34.060 --> 02:35.900
I think they do something for the acoustics.

02:35.900 --> 02:37.060
Classy Chris.

02:37.060 --> 02:39.520
All right, before we go any further,

02:39.520 --> 02:41.260
let's also bring in the virtual lug.

02:41.260 --> 02:42.800
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

02:42.800 --> 02:44.340
Hello.

02:44.340 --> 02:45.160
Howdy.

02:45.160 --> 02:46.000
Good evening.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.100
Hello, all 32 of you.

02:47.100 --> 02:49.340
We also have a couple of special guests

02:49.340 --> 02:51.600
who will be joining us in just a couple of minutes

02:51.600 --> 02:55.020
to give us the story directly from the source.

02:55.020 --> 02:56.380
So we'll get to them in a moment.

02:56.380 --> 03:00.020
But we start out with some news that I bet a lot of you,

03:00.020 --> 03:02.580
if you follow the last couple of episodes,

03:02.580 --> 03:04.380
are maybe aware of, I hope.

03:04.380 --> 03:07.580
But I'm very excited to say that Linux Action News

03:07.580 --> 03:10.860
is back with episode 153.

03:10.860 --> 03:12.700
It has a special place in my heart, that show.

03:12.700 --> 03:14.820
But also, I arrogantly thought,

03:14.820 --> 03:17.260
oh, we'll pick up a lot of the slack here in Linux Unplugged

03:17.260 --> 03:19.820
and cover all of the news, and it'll be fine.

03:19.820 --> 03:22.340
And didn't really pan out.

03:22.340 --> 03:25.380
It just didn't really, it was too much of a lift.

03:25.380 --> 03:26.620
There's too much news.

03:26.620 --> 03:27.460
That's right.

03:27.460 --> 03:29.140
And it deserves its own show.

03:29.140 --> 03:33.480
But also, there's an analysis aspect to Linux Action News.

03:33.480 --> 03:34.920
We do our homework for that show,

03:34.920 --> 03:36.020
and we try to do the research

03:36.020 --> 03:37.740
and often reach out for contacts

03:37.740 --> 03:39.300
and try to get the story from people

03:39.300 --> 03:40.940
and then incorporate that into the commentary.

03:40.940 --> 03:42.820
And it's just the sole focus of that show,

03:42.820 --> 03:44.060
and that's what makes it special.

03:44.060 --> 03:46.340
And that often means it's less than 30 minutes.

03:46.340 --> 03:49.620
So linuxactionnews.com, go grab that.

03:49.620 --> 03:52.540
And as these new shows start back up,

03:52.540 --> 03:55.260
because we just also relaunched Dakota Radio,

03:55.260 --> 03:56.720
as we bring things back,

03:56.720 --> 03:58.900
the best place to really stay in the loop

03:58.900 --> 04:00.580
is the All Shows feed.

04:00.580 --> 04:04.500
Because as we relaunch these shows or bring a new show on,

04:04.500 --> 04:06.040
that's one of the first places it'll show up

04:06.040 --> 04:08.420
is the Jupiter Broadcasting All Shows feed.

04:08.420 --> 04:10.080
So you might search for that in your podcatcher

04:10.080 --> 04:11.420
or go grab it from the website,

04:11.420 --> 04:13.800
because that's really your best solution.

04:13.800 --> 04:14.900
But do check out both those,

04:14.900 --> 04:17.820
Koda Radio and Linux Action News is back.

04:17.820 --> 04:21.160
This first story, that's not about us,

04:22.380 --> 04:23.820
brings me back to the old days

04:23.820 --> 04:26.620
of me trying to use Linux in a corporate environment,

04:26.620 --> 04:28.620
an all Windows corporate environment.

04:28.620 --> 04:29.820
Oh gosh.

04:29.820 --> 04:31.780
I couldn't imagine news like this,

04:31.780 --> 04:34.080
but it appears just under the wire,

04:34.080 --> 04:36.900
even actually after the feature freeze,

04:36.900 --> 04:39.260
Ubuntu 2010's Ubiquiti installer,

04:39.260 --> 04:41.880
which is used by the Ubuntu desktop version,

04:41.880 --> 04:45.060
is gonna see Active Directory integration.

04:45.060 --> 04:47.200
The feature freeze exception was sought and granted

04:47.200 --> 04:49.460
for adding this optional Active Directory support

04:49.460 --> 04:51.380
to the Ubuntu desktop installer.

04:51.380 --> 04:52.700
How is this actually gonna work?

04:52.700 --> 04:55.540
Well, during user setup in Ubiquiti,

04:55.540 --> 04:56.620
there'll be a little checkbox

04:56.620 --> 04:59.460
for enabling Active Directory logins.

04:59.460 --> 05:01.020
Once it's checked, a user can log in

05:01.020 --> 05:03.620
to an Active Directory configuration on their network,

05:03.620 --> 05:06.460
while, and this is probably key for some people out there,

05:06.460 --> 05:08.400
still creating a local Ubuntu account

05:08.400 --> 05:10.660
for administration purposes.

05:10.660 --> 05:12.260
The installer will then allow,

05:12.260 --> 05:15.100
specifying the domain, the administrator, the password,

05:15.100 --> 05:17.500
and a nice little test configuration to go test

05:17.500 --> 05:18.740
to make sure that your domain connection

05:18.740 --> 05:20.060
is actually up and running.

05:21.020 --> 05:22.320
This is great to see.

05:22.320 --> 05:23.420
This is really wonderful.

05:23.420 --> 05:25.820
I'll tell you, the first time I ever saw this,

05:25.820 --> 05:27.700
and it's always been hit and miss over the years,

05:27.700 --> 05:29.920
although I imagine now it's gotten nailed down pretty well.

05:29.920 --> 05:32.220
First time I ever saw this was baked into Yast,

05:32.220 --> 05:33.780
and Yast also had the option

05:33.780 --> 05:36.660
to launch an Active Directory server itself,

05:36.660 --> 05:38.840
and there were a couple of cracks at this

05:38.840 --> 05:41.140
with Mandriva and Xandros as well,

05:41.140 --> 05:43.220
and one of the reasons I even used Xandros

05:43.220 --> 05:44.860
for a little while, which is based on Debian,

05:44.860 --> 05:49.140
was because it promised really good Active Directory support

05:49.140 --> 05:51.820
with a back then, what was called a KDE desktop.

05:51.820 --> 05:53.580
Now, this is looking like a pretty good release.

05:53.580 --> 05:55.860
2010 is gonna have Open ZFS improvements,

05:55.860 --> 05:57.340
it's gonna have Kernel 5.8,

05:57.340 --> 06:00.740
and GNOME 3.38 as well as what Wes just talked about,

06:00.740 --> 06:02.380
and a bunch of other package updates.

06:02.380 --> 06:03.900
Something to look forward to.

06:03.900 --> 06:05.860
Isn't it nice to see that kind of stuff landing,

06:05.860 --> 06:08.560
and it really helps Linux be a first-class citizen

06:08.560 --> 06:09.680
in a corporate environment.

06:09.680 --> 06:11.540
Right, that's kind of what stuck in my mind,

06:11.540 --> 06:13.260
as clearly Canonical has seen this,

06:13.260 --> 06:15.100
has talked to folks out in the field

06:15.100 --> 06:18.160
who are trying to use this awesome Linux desktop,

06:18.160 --> 06:21.720
but still have some classic legacy administrators out there,

06:21.720 --> 06:24.380
and once you've got this big Active Directory setup,

06:24.380 --> 06:25.920
you're not just gonna toss that by the side,

06:25.920 --> 06:26.760
you're still gonna use it,

06:26.760 --> 06:28.560
it's got all of this information in it,

06:28.560 --> 06:30.180
so if we can just play nice,

06:30.180 --> 06:32.380
all the easier to slip Linux on it.

06:32.380 --> 06:35.780
Yeah, and it's not just about the authentication

06:35.780 --> 06:38.440
for logins, which we talk about a lot,

06:38.440 --> 06:40.660
but in an established Active Directory environment,

06:40.660 --> 06:43.940
those user IDs are tied to groups

06:43.940 --> 06:46.940
that may be very possibly your email distribution groups

06:46.940 --> 06:48.040
are based off of.

06:48.040 --> 06:51.720
Certainly the file rights on the company shares

06:51.720 --> 06:54.760
are based off of these Active Directory accounts.

06:54.760 --> 06:56.820
Lots of applications for enterprise

06:56.820 --> 06:58.140
integrate with Active Directory,

06:58.140 --> 07:01.380
so you can even manage security key card access

07:01.380 --> 07:03.380
via Active Directory account status.

07:03.380 --> 07:05.140
The list goes on and on and on,

07:05.140 --> 07:08.220
and so when you get access to that,

07:08.220 --> 07:09.620
you become part of that ecosystem,

07:09.620 --> 07:11.460
because that means also now the Linux system

07:11.460 --> 07:14.020
that you're using will understand

07:14.020 --> 07:16.460
that this group ID on the file server

07:16.460 --> 07:17.940
translates to this actual group,

07:17.940 --> 07:18.940
and yes, you are a member of that,

07:18.940 --> 07:19.780
and you can get access to it,

07:19.780 --> 07:21.140
and you can change file permissions,

07:21.140 --> 07:23.980
and you can actually participate in this broader ecosystem,

07:23.980 --> 07:26.500
so it has a lot of knock-on effects.

07:26.500 --> 07:27.860
There's always a lot of knock-on effects

07:27.860 --> 07:30.300
when Debian makes changes, talking about Ubuntu,

07:30.300 --> 07:34.900
and there is some news out of DebConf 20,

07:34.900 --> 07:36.380
which concluded last week.

07:36.380 --> 07:38.620
Debian project leader Jonathan Carter gave his talk

07:38.620 --> 07:40.940
at the event as well as an overview

07:40.940 --> 07:42.620
of where the project is today,

07:42.620 --> 07:45.940
and some of the problems that he believes they are facing.

07:45.940 --> 07:47.700
Debian's finances are sitting around

07:47.700 --> 07:50.980
a healthy 896,000 US dollars.

07:50.980 --> 07:52.920
Thanks to COVID-19, actually,

07:52.920 --> 07:55.740
there was less travel and conference expenses.

07:55.740 --> 07:56.820
I wouldn't call it a surplus,

07:56.820 --> 07:59.740
but they haven't spent as much as they expected.

07:59.740 --> 08:01.660
Carter also noted as part of their fund,

08:01.660 --> 08:03.340
Debian is in the process of acquiring

08:03.340 --> 08:05.580
two new Lenovo servers.

08:05.580 --> 08:08.100
They were able to obtain a discount, it appears,

08:08.100 --> 08:09.320
to help in their efforts.

08:09.320 --> 08:11.100
As for the health of their archive,

08:11.100 --> 08:12.500
well, Debian is up to offering

08:12.500 --> 08:16.820
around 61,000 AMD64 packages, oh my,

08:16.820 --> 08:20.180
and around 31,000 source packages.

08:20.180 --> 08:22.140
Another exciting item moving forward

08:22.140 --> 08:25.220
is the possibility of Lenovo or other OEMs

08:25.220 --> 08:28.020
offering a Debian preloaded system,

08:28.020 --> 08:29.340
but before that can happen,

08:29.340 --> 08:30.940
there are still some support concerns

08:30.940 --> 08:33.100
and other technical issues to work through.

08:33.100 --> 08:34.180
Now, that's interesting, huh,

08:34.180 --> 08:37.300
because we're seeing that Fedora

08:37.300 --> 08:39.300
has launched on the X1 Carbon,

08:39.300 --> 08:42.380
and we know that Ubuntu, not too far behind,

08:42.380 --> 08:44.580
and now it sounds like maybe Lenovo's even open

08:44.580 --> 08:47.300
to the idea of straight up Debian.

08:47.300 --> 08:48.980
Now, the other thing they talked about,

08:48.980 --> 08:50.800
and this always gets in my craw,

08:50.800 --> 08:53.140
is needing to improve quote unquote marketing.

08:53.140 --> 08:55.780
They say it's an issue common to many open source projects,

08:55.780 --> 08:58.620
but Debian especially, often saying it's an unsung hero

08:58.620 --> 09:01.940
underneath the likes of Ubuntu and Steam OS.

09:01.940 --> 09:04.060
Now, I'm not gonna get on my whole soapbox

09:04.060 --> 09:06.060
about this, we have too much to get into today,

09:06.060 --> 09:09.620
but I really hate when we do this to ourselves.

09:09.620 --> 09:13.220
I think it's a lack of perception and perspective

09:13.220 --> 09:15.660
of where Linux is and its role in the marketplace

09:15.660 --> 09:17.700
and the type of consumer that's drawn to it.

09:17.700 --> 09:20.260
I think it is a lack of understanding the dynamics

09:20.260 --> 09:21.920
of the wider ecosystem.

09:21.920 --> 09:24.300
It's a good comparative to understand this to

09:24.300 --> 09:25.780
would be Android.

09:25.780 --> 09:29.700
No one who buys an Android device quote unquote no one,

09:29.700 --> 09:31.240
going by the numbers,

09:31.240 --> 09:34.740
knows that Android is using Linux under the hood, right?

09:34.740 --> 09:38.300
But we all do, just like everyone listening

09:38.300 --> 09:40.540
and you all in the mumble room,

09:40.540 --> 09:43.460
you all know that Ubuntu is based on Debian.

09:43.460 --> 09:46.460
This slice of the market knows that.

09:46.460 --> 09:48.260
And that, as a technical project,

09:48.260 --> 09:50.020
is your best chance of who you're gonna market to.

09:50.020 --> 09:50.860
You're not gonna-

09:50.860 --> 09:52.380
I wonder though, maybe that's,

09:52.380 --> 09:54.420
is that what they're getting at here though?

09:54.420 --> 09:55.780
Because I feel like maybe there is,

09:55.780 --> 09:58.980
I agree on the larger part, like marketing the Debian,

09:58.980 --> 10:00.620
the nitty gritty to the wider user experience,

10:00.620 --> 10:04.900
but maybe even amongst the Linux in the know folks,

10:04.900 --> 10:07.180
sort of take Debian for granted, we forget about it.

10:07.180 --> 10:09.540
I mean, how much do we even talk about it here on the show?

10:09.540 --> 10:11.460
I think you could argue there's reasons

10:11.460 --> 10:12.820
beyond marketing for that.

10:12.820 --> 10:14.620
There seems to be certain areas

10:14.620 --> 10:16.060
that the project doesn't engage in

10:16.060 --> 10:18.380
and other areas that they seem to engage in.

10:18.380 --> 10:21.440
And they seem to spend a lot of time spinning internally

10:21.440 --> 10:23.100
and a lot of energy spent doing that.

10:23.100 --> 10:25.340
I think they do have a perception problem,

10:25.340 --> 10:27.140
but none of this is actually marketing.

10:27.140 --> 10:30.020
So marketing implies that if you could buy a page

10:30.020 --> 10:32.860
in a magazine or buy some banner ads on a website

10:32.860 --> 10:34.820
that people would be flocking to your distribution

10:34.820 --> 10:36.420
and give it more respect for what it does.

10:36.420 --> 10:40.100
But that's, even when I just verbalize what they're implying,

10:40.100 --> 10:41.760
it sounds ludicrous.

10:41.760 --> 10:43.700
Well, that's like a general conception of marketing,

10:43.700 --> 10:46.140
but couldn't it also mean just having more resources spent

10:46.140 --> 10:49.160
at, well, once we're doing that again, at meetups,

10:49.160 --> 10:51.340
at mentioning all the things that Debian is used for

10:51.340 --> 10:54.180
at better integration with partners that are using Debian,

10:54.180 --> 10:57.240
better representation in cloud marketplaces perhaps?

10:57.240 --> 10:59.340
Yeah, I think that is an area they will invest in.

10:59.340 --> 11:00.820
And that is totally an area that makes sense.

11:00.820 --> 11:03.180
But if you think about who you're reaching there,

11:03.180 --> 11:06.920
you're reaching probably that kind of tier of the market

11:06.920 --> 11:07.960
that I was talking about.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.260
People that already know about Debian,

11:09.260 --> 11:11.220
but maybe just don't think about it a lot.

11:11.220 --> 11:13.320
Right, that could be a good way to go.

11:13.320 --> 11:16.020
When I look at Debian as like an outside observer,

11:16.020 --> 11:18.700
I see something that I have a deep appreciation

11:18.700 --> 11:21.560
and respect for, borderline love fest for really.

11:21.560 --> 11:22.560
There's a few things out there

11:22.560 --> 11:24.780
that have been with us for so long.

11:24.780 --> 11:28.680
And so for me, Debian was the distribution when I used it,

11:28.680 --> 11:30.440
I realized, oh, I can switch to Linux.

11:30.440 --> 11:33.980
Like I had used Red Hat, which was, you know,

11:33.980 --> 11:36.380
the good old bad days of RPMs

11:36.380 --> 11:38.760
and manually solving RPM dependencies.

11:38.760 --> 11:40.060
Like we're going way back here, right?

11:40.060 --> 11:42.760
And then I switched over to Debian and apt came along

11:42.760 --> 11:44.400
and it changed my mind

11:44.400 --> 11:46.660
of how a computer can help me manage it.

11:46.660 --> 11:48.760
I have a deep appreciation for Debian,

11:48.760 --> 11:51.600
but when I try to think of what they're doing in the space

11:51.600 --> 11:53.100
that gets people to talk about them,

11:53.100 --> 11:55.800
I can't really enumerate much.

11:55.800 --> 11:57.240
Like I don't see anybody at Debian

11:57.240 --> 11:59.640
pioneering arm development and champion that.

11:59.640 --> 12:02.640
I haven't heard about any big OEM deals with Debian.

12:02.640 --> 12:05.280
And I'm not saying these things are necessary,

12:05.280 --> 12:08.080
but if you do want chatter, if you want buzz,

12:08.080 --> 12:09.680
you kind of have to do something

12:09.680 --> 12:11.760
that people will talk about.

12:11.760 --> 12:12.720
Yeah, that's a good point.

12:12.720 --> 12:14.680
And maybe we should note too that Carter believes

12:14.680 --> 12:16.220
that they need two to three times

12:16.220 --> 12:17.620
their current volunteer levels

12:17.620 --> 12:20.460
to accomplish all of their goals.

12:20.460 --> 12:23.300
He also feels Debian is too lacking in the area of diversity

12:23.300 --> 12:25.640
and not catching up fast enough.

12:25.640 --> 12:27.700
Partially the blame there is, you know, large regions

12:27.700 --> 12:29.200
of the world not being represented

12:29.200 --> 12:31.540
and the people making and maintaining Debian

12:31.540 --> 12:33.940
and maybe failing to put together a timely message

12:33.940 --> 12:37.040
regarding Black Lives Matter and other recent concerns.

12:37.040 --> 12:38.740
That kind of raises off the mark to me.

12:38.740 --> 12:41.380
If that's what they think is not driving contributions,

12:41.380 --> 12:43.580
again, I don't think they're properly assessing the market,

12:43.580 --> 12:45.480
but I may be wrong, what do I know?

12:45.480 --> 12:47.580
I'm just some dumb podcaster in the Seattle area,

12:47.580 --> 12:48.660
so don't listen to me.

12:48.660 --> 12:50.900
It's fascinating in either case that we sort of get

12:50.900 --> 12:52.920
to watch this discussion going on, right?

12:52.920 --> 12:55.260
That's true, and at least it's happening.

12:55.260 --> 12:58.760
There's that as well, so that I appreciate.

12:58.760 --> 12:59.960
I want to talk about PipeWire.

12:59.960 --> 13:02.000
It's been a little while since we've done an update

13:02.000 --> 13:05.300
on PipeWire, and it looks like over the late summer

13:05.300 --> 13:09.100
and before, there has been some significant developments.

13:09.100 --> 13:11.580
PipeWire is increasingly getting ready

13:11.580 --> 13:14.720
for more user testing, and if you recall,

13:14.720 --> 13:16.580
this is the Red Hat project for better audio

13:16.580 --> 13:19.180
and video stream management on Linux,

13:19.180 --> 13:22.920
and it's increasingly getting close to shipping time.

13:22.920 --> 13:25.260
Yeah, PipeWire lead developer, Wim Tamens,

13:25.260 --> 13:27.760
feels that the code is at a state where PulseAudio,

13:27.760 --> 13:30.900
Jack, and also backends are usable,

13:30.900 --> 13:33.840
I mean, if not 100% feature complete,

13:33.840 --> 13:35.400
and actually, it's in good enough shape

13:35.400 --> 13:38.280
that he and others at the Red Hat desktop team

13:38.280 --> 13:40.400
are hoping to see more user testing happen

13:40.400 --> 13:42.740
with the latest PipeWire code.

13:42.740 --> 13:45.240
It now has a fully functioning session manager

13:45.240 --> 13:48.440
with Wire Plumber, human readable handling of audio devices,

13:48.440 --> 13:49.920
hey, that's pretty important,

13:49.920 --> 13:52.820
support for creating audio sync devices with Jack,

13:52.820 --> 13:56.220
hey-o, and support for creating devices with GStreamer,

13:56.220 --> 13:58.800
among a bunch of other great improvements.

13:58.800 --> 14:02.020
Well, to talk about all of this is lead developer, Wim.

14:02.020 --> 14:02.960
He joins us now.

14:02.960 --> 14:04.160
It's been a little while, Wim.

14:04.160 --> 14:05.560
Welcome back to the show.

14:05.560 --> 14:07.100
Hi, hello, everybody.

14:07.100 --> 14:09.100
Hello, and congratulations

14:09.100 --> 14:10.800
on the continued work with PipeWire.

14:10.800 --> 14:13.240
It sounds like we're getting pretty close

14:13.240 --> 14:15.340
to production ready, is that right?

14:15.340 --> 14:19.620
Well, pretty close is a lot to say,

14:19.620 --> 14:21.680
but it's ready for testing.

14:21.680 --> 14:22.520
Okay.

14:22.520 --> 14:25.520
So I expect at least six months of testing.

14:25.520 --> 14:26.920
You know, I was looking back,

14:26.920 --> 14:30.120
you were on the show in October of 2018,

14:30.120 --> 14:33.800
and one of the things that we focused on a lot

14:33.800 --> 14:37.320
in that conversation was the need for a session manager.

14:37.320 --> 14:39.900
In fact, I think it was maybe the bulk of our discussion.

14:39.900 --> 14:43.300
Would you mind explaining what a session manager is

14:43.300 --> 14:46.000
and what we have now with PipeWire?

14:46.000 --> 14:47.100
That's an interesting thing.

14:47.100 --> 14:50.140
So if you look at PipeWire itself,

14:50.140 --> 14:53.580
it's kind of like a blank canvas, basically,

14:53.580 --> 14:57.320
where you can put like devices and stuff like that

14:57.320 --> 14:58.880
and link them together,

14:58.880 --> 15:01.080
but in itself, there's nothing there.

15:01.080 --> 15:04.120
So you need to have a session manager

15:04.120 --> 15:05.820
that puts things on the canvas,

15:05.820 --> 15:09.400
like for example, creating all the devices

15:09.400 --> 15:13.800
based on also what is detected with Udef

15:13.800 --> 15:17.540
or like Bluetooth devices that appear or things like that.

15:17.540 --> 15:21.700
So the session manager, it's basically like presents

15:21.700 --> 15:25.440
all of the devices to PipeWire.

15:25.440 --> 15:27.940
So PipeWire is basically the IPC,

15:27.940 --> 15:29.540
the apps that connect to PipeWire

15:29.540 --> 15:32.020
see the graph of all these devices

15:32.020 --> 15:36.120
that are basically managed by the session manager.

15:36.980 --> 15:38.460
So the session manager as well,

15:38.460 --> 15:41.460
it looks at, for example, when a new app appears,

15:41.460 --> 15:43.460
it looks, oh, what does it do?

15:43.460 --> 15:44.700
What is its role?

15:44.700 --> 15:45.860
And things like that.

15:45.860 --> 15:48.660
And then it tries to find out where to link it to

15:48.660 --> 15:50.460
and it manages the links.

15:50.460 --> 15:53.640
If a device is removed, it relinks it to another device.

15:53.640 --> 15:57.540
And all of that logic is done by a session manager.

15:57.540 --> 15:58.480
It's Wire Plumber, right?

15:58.480 --> 16:00.280
That's the name of it, pretty clever.

16:00.280 --> 16:04.040
Yeah, we're not exactly using Wire Plumber yet.

16:04.040 --> 16:06.120
It's on the to-do list for soon.

16:06.120 --> 16:08.880
Currently, it's like an experimental

16:08.880 --> 16:11.060
internal session manager,

16:11.060 --> 16:13.520
but basically all of that code is moved

16:13.520 --> 16:16.920
into a nicer code base that is Wire Plumber.

16:16.920 --> 16:19.660
This has been a project a long time in the works.

16:19.660 --> 16:21.800
The announcement about starting,

16:21.800 --> 16:26.060
I think you made in 2017, if I recall correctly.

16:26.060 --> 16:28.940
And it sounds like we're at the point where

16:28.940 --> 16:32.200
if someone's willing to take a little risk,

16:32.200 --> 16:35.520
they could turn this on, say if they're on Fedora 33,

16:35.520 --> 16:38.420
and start using this as their sound system?

16:38.420 --> 16:42.420
Yes, I've been running it for a while as my main desktop.

16:42.420 --> 16:45.860
For today, with the mumble session I did in there too,

16:45.860 --> 16:48.480
there was some weird bugs still.

16:48.480 --> 16:52.420
But otherwise, it sort of works for regular desktop use.

16:52.420 --> 16:53.920
There are some things that need fixing,

16:53.920 --> 16:57.900
and we will fix them, but you can use it for basic things,

16:57.900 --> 17:00.640
like watching YouTube and playing movies.

17:00.640 --> 17:01.660
So exciting.

17:01.660 --> 17:03.980
What is the more challenging desktop application?

17:03.980 --> 17:04.900
Is it web browsers?

17:04.900 --> 17:07.500
Like, what is it that is vexing you?

17:08.540 --> 17:10.780
It's mostly the PulseAudio API.

17:10.780 --> 17:14.980
So I actually need to emulate all of the PulseAudio API

17:14.980 --> 17:18.560
with all of its timings and all of that thing

17:18.560 --> 17:20.460
for apps to actually work well.

17:20.460 --> 17:23.500
Because a lot of apps are programmed in a way I do this,

17:23.500 --> 17:25.220
and then I set the time of that,

17:25.220 --> 17:28.940
and it's very specific to how PulseAudio does things.

17:28.940 --> 17:31.860
So I need to emulate all of that.

17:31.860 --> 17:34.300
So that is currently the biggest problem.

17:34.300 --> 17:36.340
Like, for example, if you look at jack apps,

17:36.340 --> 17:39.340
they are much more, that's a much more simpler API,

17:39.340 --> 17:42.040
and they work a lot better out of the box.

17:42.040 --> 17:44.700
And so last time we spoke, I believe that was the plan,

17:44.700 --> 17:46.820
is to essentially implement the jack API.

17:46.820 --> 17:49.700
And so if I'm a jack user, which we are here in the studio,

17:49.700 --> 17:51.140
am I in a better position?

17:51.140 --> 17:53.720
It has more chance of working well, yes.

17:55.060 --> 17:57.380
Like, for example, if you run Ardour or something,

17:57.380 --> 17:58.460
it works fine.

17:58.460 --> 18:00.140
Hey, lucky me.

18:00.140 --> 18:03.020
Yeah, I actually did some testing myself

18:03.020 --> 18:06.740
just a couple of days ago to see kind of where it's at.

18:06.740 --> 18:08.700
And I did find a couple of bugs,

18:08.700 --> 18:11.580
like Carla, when a device would disappear,

18:11.580 --> 18:14.860
Carla wouldn't, you know, reflow the canvas,

18:14.860 --> 18:17.480
and I'd end up having to close it and reopen it.

18:17.480 --> 18:19.280
But I think that's actually a Carla bug

18:19.280 --> 18:21.120
and not a PipeWire bug.

18:21.120 --> 18:24.100
But that said, the jack implementation

18:24.100 --> 18:26.940
is working really, really, really well.

18:26.940 --> 18:29.100
You know, you do have to go into a config file

18:29.100 --> 18:32.380
to change like the sampling rate or something like that.

18:32.380 --> 18:36.460
But everything I threw at it really just worked

18:36.460 --> 18:38.060
with the exception of Flatpak,

18:38.060 --> 18:40.780
which I know is not yet supported.

18:40.780 --> 18:42.940
So I'm really impressed.

18:42.940 --> 18:45.980
So far, it's looking really, really good.

18:45.980 --> 18:47.380
Wim, I'm kind of curious,

18:47.380 --> 18:49.360
when we talk to you about this a lot,

18:49.360 --> 18:51.060
we're primarily talking about Fedora

18:51.060 --> 18:53.960
because we kind of know it's going to be there.

18:53.960 --> 18:55.980
And Fedora has been very aggressive

18:55.980 --> 18:58.080
on getting to Wayland and creating solutions

18:58.080 --> 19:00.180
that work well with contained applications and whatnot,

19:00.180 --> 19:02.860
which PipeWire checks all those boxes.

19:02.860 --> 19:06.220
What is adoption outside of Fedora looking like right now?

19:06.220 --> 19:10.540
I think it's being important in distributions.

19:10.540 --> 19:14.040
Well, mainly PipeWire is used for the screen sharing.

19:14.040 --> 19:16.100
So I think that's on top of Wayland,

19:16.100 --> 19:18.900
that's basically the de facto standard.

19:18.900 --> 19:23.220
So once the version gets updated to 3.10,

19:23.220 --> 19:25.380
the audio bits are there too,

19:25.380 --> 19:29.300
and you can basically use the audio bits there too.

19:29.300 --> 19:32.580
So, but yes, I think everybody's watching a bit

19:32.580 --> 19:35.020
to see how it goes in Fedora first.

19:35.020 --> 19:38.940
And we can't really enable it by default yet.

19:38.940 --> 19:40.180
I guess that makes sense.

19:40.180 --> 19:42.660
But you are taking a pretty sensible approach,

19:42.660 --> 19:44.120
nice and slow and steady.

19:44.120 --> 19:45.340
I hope so.

19:45.340 --> 19:46.180
I hope so too.

19:46.180 --> 19:49.700
It's a very big undertaking too.

19:49.700 --> 19:53.780
It's three APIs that need to be moved to something new.

19:53.780 --> 19:56.260
Also, Jack and Paul saw you.

19:56.260 --> 19:57.300
That's a huge undertaking.

19:57.300 --> 19:59.540
I mean, you're kind of redoing in a sense

19:59.540 --> 20:02.420
or reformulating how the entire media scape

20:02.420 --> 20:04.540
on the Linux desktop works.

20:04.540 --> 20:05.380
Yes.

20:05.380 --> 20:06.220
Yeah.

20:06.220 --> 20:08.620
He says with a big sigh, yeah.

20:08.620 --> 20:10.220
And we're very grateful.

20:10.220 --> 20:12.100
I'll tell you what I'm really looking forward to

20:12.100 --> 20:16.380
is when Fedora Jam and PipeWire are both working in sync

20:16.380 --> 20:19.340
and we finally have like a low latency kernel

20:19.340 --> 20:21.380
available for Fedora,

20:21.380 --> 20:26.380
and it becomes sort of the go-to for multimedia production.

20:26.620 --> 20:31.620
That really is my dream of where I want Fedora to go.

20:31.620 --> 20:35.620
Ooh, seeing the work that's going into PipeWire,

20:35.620 --> 20:37.260
it feels closer than ever.

20:37.260 --> 20:38.620
Thank you very much, Wim.

20:38.620 --> 20:39.580
You're welcome.

20:39.580 --> 20:43.660
So Wim, as a takeaway for the audience

20:43.660 --> 20:45.780
that runs Linux on the desktop,

20:45.780 --> 20:48.500
in a year or two, as these things stabilize

20:48.500 --> 20:49.940
and adoption increases,

20:49.940 --> 20:52.060
what's the primary benefit do you think end users

20:52.060 --> 20:53.420
will notice?

20:53.420 --> 20:57.220
Well, we will have enabled audio in a secure way in apps,

20:57.220 --> 20:59.980
but that's not exactly user friendly.

20:59.980 --> 21:00.980
Right, it's good for them,

21:00.980 --> 21:02.020
but it's not something they-

21:02.020 --> 21:03.180
Hopefully they never notice.

21:03.180 --> 21:04.980
It just works like they expect.

21:06.060 --> 21:09.660
So I just hope that we will be able to do new things.

21:09.660 --> 21:11.780
Like for example, in GNOME,

21:11.780 --> 21:16.500
have a panel where you can put like filters for your syncs

21:16.500 --> 21:19.380
or like make more configuration panels

21:19.380 --> 21:21.460
for doing stuff with your audio,

21:21.460 --> 21:23.500
like what you have in core audio.

21:23.500 --> 21:24.340
Oh yeah.

21:24.340 --> 21:26.180
And then there's like, for example,

21:26.180 --> 21:28.340
you'll be able to run Ardour,

21:28.340 --> 21:32.980
which is not exactly for average users,

21:32.980 --> 21:35.700
but at least you can run it and it runs out of the box,

21:35.700 --> 21:38.140
like something that you actually should expect

21:38.140 --> 21:39.980
from an operating system,

21:39.980 --> 21:42.780
that it runs these pro apps out of the box.

21:42.780 --> 21:45.860
Right, in a way it's the groundwork

21:45.860 --> 21:48.980
to enable a more powerful generation

21:48.980 --> 21:51.420
of production applications on Linux.

21:51.420 --> 21:53.340
Yeah, and for what it's worth,

21:53.340 --> 21:54.820
even some proprietary stuff,

21:54.820 --> 21:56.020
like I threw Reaper at it

21:56.020 --> 22:00.420
and I encountered zero bugs using Reaper with PipeWire.

22:00.420 --> 22:01.260
Whoa.

22:01.260 --> 22:02.420
That's good news.

22:02.420 --> 22:03.300
Boy, we're looking good.

22:03.300 --> 22:06.540
We may be early PipeWire adopters right here.

22:06.540 --> 22:08.260
You know, I am curious though,

22:08.260 --> 22:09.660
one of the big things about PipeWire

22:09.660 --> 22:11.300
when we last talked to you about it, Wim,

22:11.300 --> 22:13.260
was that audio and video,

22:13.260 --> 22:15.460
at least in the backend, weren't too different.

22:15.460 --> 22:17.620
I'm curious how video support's coming along

22:17.620 --> 22:20.780
just in the current Zoom dominated world.

22:20.780 --> 22:22.180
I've seen a lot of folks messing around

22:22.180 --> 22:23.740
with loop back video devices

22:23.740 --> 22:25.460
and getting OBS things set up,

22:25.460 --> 22:27.540
all sorts of stuff that the PipeWire model

22:27.540 --> 22:29.020
might make a lot easier.

22:29.020 --> 22:31.020
Yeah, we're not there yet.

22:31.020 --> 22:34.220
So you can capture from a camera, but that's about it.

22:34.220 --> 22:39.220
There is an internal format for doing video filters,

22:40.860 --> 22:43.340
but there is no example.

22:43.340 --> 22:46.100
I have a Vulkan source, but that's it.

22:46.100 --> 22:49.180
So, and the synchronization with audio

22:49.180 --> 22:51.420
is not really worked out yet.

22:51.420 --> 22:53.420
It should all be internally there,

22:53.420 --> 22:55.860
but it's up in the air.

22:55.860 --> 22:57.340
Still gotta tie it all together.

22:57.340 --> 22:58.180
Yeah.

22:58.180 --> 23:01.460
Well, we're gonna send you a beer and Red Bull

23:01.460 --> 23:02.980
and you can pick which one you want

23:02.980 --> 23:04.580
for until this thing's done.

23:06.140 --> 23:08.740
Well, Wim, thank you for coming on and giving us an update.

23:08.740 --> 23:10.140
You could tell it's a project we follow

23:10.140 --> 23:10.980
with a lot of passion.

23:10.980 --> 23:13.140
And we thought it has been too long

23:13.140 --> 23:13.980
since we've done an update.

23:13.980 --> 23:16.340
And it seems like it's relatively simple

23:16.340 --> 23:18.780
in later versions of Fedora to flip on and start testing.

23:18.780 --> 23:20.380
Yeah, should try it.

23:20.380 --> 23:22.020
I think we might try it in our Bugathon

23:22.020 --> 23:23.940
on the live stream later today.

23:23.940 --> 23:25.980
Well, Wim, thank you very much for joining us.

23:25.980 --> 23:26.820
Thank you.

23:29.420 --> 23:31.580
Linode.com slash unplugged.

23:31.580 --> 23:33.620
Go to Linode.com slash unplugged

23:33.620 --> 23:37.260
and get a $100 credit for 60 days on new accounts.

23:37.260 --> 23:40.700
$100 for Linode is fantastic.

23:40.700 --> 23:44.500
Linode is simple cloud infrastructure with lots of options,

23:44.500 --> 23:46.540
block storage, object storage,

23:46.540 --> 23:48.860
and they have a really easy interface to use it

23:48.860 --> 23:50.980
or plug it in with a wider orchestration system

23:50.980 --> 23:53.420
like Kubernetes or Terraform,

23:53.420 --> 23:55.060
which is something we've been playing with.

23:55.060 --> 23:58.220
They have shared plans starting as low as $5.

23:58.220 --> 23:59.100
Go for it.

23:59.100 --> 24:00.860
I mean, with $100 credit, go for it.

24:00.860 --> 24:03.300
They have dedicated GPU compute plans.

24:03.300 --> 24:04.460
Or if you're like us and you just want

24:04.460 --> 24:06.420
a decently priced system to mess around with,

24:06.420 --> 24:08.380
like we did something I think middish tier

24:08.380 --> 24:10.620
for the matrix server, and it's fantastic.

24:10.620 --> 24:12.740
The thing runs like a champ.

24:12.740 --> 24:15.340
And with 11 data centers all over the world,

24:15.340 --> 24:17.740
there's probably something close to you that works.

24:17.740 --> 24:20.660
They also have a really fast next generation network.

24:20.660 --> 24:23.100
40 gigabit connections to the machines.

24:23.100 --> 24:24.660
I mean, it's super fast.

24:24.660 --> 24:27.940
With industry leading CPUs, a revamped cloud manager,

24:27.940 --> 24:29.380
and root access to your server,

24:29.380 --> 24:32.700
along with their API that is super cool

24:32.700 --> 24:33.900
if you'd use nothing else

24:33.900 --> 24:36.700
but the Linode command line application.

24:36.700 --> 24:37.900
That's what I use on my rig.

24:37.900 --> 24:39.140
And Wes, you should check this out too

24:39.140 --> 24:40.260
because it's great for show notes.

24:40.260 --> 24:42.980
You know how we'll sometimes use the object storage

24:42.980 --> 24:45.700
to embed audio in our show notes for like a clip?

24:45.700 --> 24:46.540
Oh yeah.

24:46.540 --> 24:48.700
Well, with the Linode command line application,

24:48.700 --> 24:50.820
once you get things like your account set up

24:50.820 --> 24:51.660
and your API key in there,

24:51.660 --> 24:53.580
you just point it at a file

24:53.580 --> 24:56.780
and tell it to just upload it to the object storage

24:56.780 --> 24:59.300
and flag it as public and return the URL.

24:59.300 --> 25:01.620
Just all one command, it uploads the file,

25:01.620 --> 25:03.300
puts it in object storage, makes it public,

25:03.300 --> 25:05.300
and gives you a shareable URL

25:05.300 --> 25:07.020
to embed on a website or something.

25:07.020 --> 25:08.500
That sounds so easy.

25:08.500 --> 25:09.340
It's super great.

25:09.340 --> 25:11.580
The command line app is actually one of my favorite things

25:11.580 --> 25:14.020
about Linode, although the web UI is fantastic too.

25:14.020 --> 25:16.380
So linode.com slash unplugged.

25:16.380 --> 25:19.940
Get a $100 credit for 60 days on a new account.

25:19.940 --> 25:22.260
That's linode.com slash unplugged.

25:22.260 --> 25:23.420
And a big thank you to Linode

25:23.420 --> 25:25.460
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

25:28.580 --> 25:31.700
So Academy 2020 is rolling on right now.

25:31.700 --> 25:35.460
It runs from Friday 4th, the 4th to September 11th,

25:35.460 --> 25:39.620
which is just a little bit after we record this episode.

25:39.620 --> 25:40.700
And Alish joins us.

25:40.700 --> 25:44.740
He is the president of the board of directors at KDEV

25:44.740 --> 25:47.100
and the co-founder of the Linux App Summit,

25:47.100 --> 25:48.340
and also a bruncher.

25:48.340 --> 25:50.340
He did brunch with Brent on March 27th,

25:50.340 --> 25:51.940
which I'll have a link in the show notes.

25:51.940 --> 25:53.220
Alish, welcome to Unplugged.

25:53.220 --> 25:55.220
Hi, thanks for having me here.

25:55.220 --> 25:56.540
Hey, thanks for joining us.

25:56.540 --> 25:58.700
And how's Academy going?

25:58.700 --> 25:59.620
Well, it's going good.

25:59.620 --> 26:04.620
Like everything in 2020 is a bit special, right?

26:04.740 --> 26:09.340
But first, Virtual Academy, it went really well.

26:09.340 --> 26:11.020
No big technical problems

26:11.020 --> 26:13.820
that would have rendered it impossible.

26:13.820 --> 26:17.460
I think that everyone who wanted to participate could

26:17.460 --> 26:18.300
and still can.

26:18.300 --> 26:21.820
We will be having sessions over the week,

26:21.820 --> 26:24.500
so still ongoing.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.140
So what we do is on the weekend,

26:26.140 --> 26:29.220
we have talks that would be more,

26:29.220 --> 26:32.540
well, what you expect from a conference kind of talks.

26:32.540 --> 26:34.140
And those are done.

26:34.140 --> 26:36.940
Actually, you can find them on the internet.

26:36.940 --> 26:39.020
I guess that we can put the URL somewhere later

26:39.020 --> 26:40.340
if somebody wants to take a look.

26:40.340 --> 26:41.580
Everything is online.

26:41.580 --> 26:42.420
Okay.

26:42.420 --> 26:43.500
Actually, this year was easier

26:43.500 --> 26:46.100
because, I mean, everything was recorded

26:46.100 --> 26:49.540
because it had to reach, and it was streamed, of course.

26:49.540 --> 26:51.260
Or you recorded them as you did them.

26:51.260 --> 26:53.580
Yeah, we were using something called Big Blue Button,

26:53.580 --> 26:55.940
which is a conferencing tool.

26:55.940 --> 26:58.300
And one of the features that you have right there,

26:58.300 --> 27:00.500
like you have chat, but you have a button to record

27:00.500 --> 27:02.900
because, I mean, the stream is going through it, right?

27:02.900 --> 27:04.420
Right, that's nice.

27:04.420 --> 27:07.100
So my question with that is,

27:07.100 --> 27:09.260
do you think this is a format you'll adopt long-term?

27:09.260 --> 27:12.140
Because I imagine it made it possible

27:12.140 --> 27:14.300
for a lot more people to attend that couldn't.

27:14.300 --> 27:17.380
Or do you feel like the lower bandwidth aspect

27:17.380 --> 27:19.700
isn't really long-term sustainable?

27:19.700 --> 27:24.100
I think that there's definitely goods and pros

27:24.100 --> 27:27.060
in making it available on the internet.

27:27.060 --> 27:30.420
I'm not going to be here, the one to convince people that,

27:31.940 --> 27:34.900
well, offering contents on the internet

27:34.900 --> 27:37.900
makes them less available or something.

27:37.900 --> 27:39.820
There's a big component into a conference, though,

27:39.820 --> 27:43.420
the social component that is kind of lacking.

27:43.420 --> 27:46.500
And I don't know if we're going to just,

27:46.500 --> 27:48.580
let's always do virtual conferences

27:48.580 --> 27:50.900
and forget about meeting at all, right?

27:50.900 --> 27:52.260
Yeah, maybe a mix.

27:52.260 --> 27:54.140
Yeah, hackers, we are already known

27:54.140 --> 27:55.700
for being not all that sociable

27:55.700 --> 27:57.300
if you remove the conferences.

27:58.860 --> 28:00.380
It's your only time to get out.

28:00.380 --> 28:01.380
That's my problem.

28:01.380 --> 28:02.220
Exactly.

28:03.380 --> 28:04.620
Yeah, but RSI is so bad

28:04.620 --> 28:05.940
because I'm not going to events this year.

28:05.940 --> 28:07.060
That's what I'll blame it on.

28:07.060 --> 28:10.820
Well, so before Academy is even over yet,

28:10.820 --> 28:13.580
you're already talking about the Linux App Summit,

28:13.580 --> 28:15.860
and I believe the call for papers ends pretty soon,

28:15.860 --> 28:17.420
so it's probably the time to get the word out.

28:17.420 --> 28:18.260
Yeah, that's right.

28:18.260 --> 28:23.260
I mean, we've been working on the LAS 2020 since last year,

28:23.340 --> 28:28.020
and it will happen in November, like you said, I think.

28:28.020 --> 28:31.220
Call for papers ends in the 1st of October.

28:31.220 --> 28:33.940
This week, we're going to announce the first keynoters,

28:33.940 --> 28:37.300
which are quite special, so stay tuned.

28:37.300 --> 28:40.140
If you're interested in talking about applications,

28:40.140 --> 28:41.540
which I think that is something

28:41.540 --> 28:45.220
that is actually quite close to end users,

28:45.220 --> 28:48.700
I think that it's a good forum to do it.

28:48.700 --> 28:51.740
It will also be the first time that we do it online

28:51.740 --> 28:54.460
and strictly virtual format.

28:54.460 --> 28:56.780
Right, I've always wanted to attend.

28:56.780 --> 28:57.900
You always should have.

28:57.900 --> 28:59.300
I know, I know, but it always was,

28:59.300 --> 29:01.140
it always conflicted with something else.

29:01.140 --> 29:03.380
There's also, you have a name conflict.

29:03.380 --> 29:04.900
I have LAS in mind, and people are going to think

29:04.900 --> 29:06.460
I'm Chris Libre Application Summit

29:06.460 --> 29:07.500
or Linux Application Summit,

29:07.500 --> 29:09.820
but maybe this is the year I can make it,

29:09.820 --> 29:11.860
so maybe I will, that's pretty great.

29:11.860 --> 29:13.500
So we'll have a link if you want to submit papers

29:13.500 --> 29:14.340
or if you have an idea,

29:14.340 --> 29:17.700
and what kind of things are you looking for for the summit?

29:17.700 --> 29:20.620
For one, we want to encourage all kinds of organizations

29:20.620 --> 29:23.860
to create applications and contents in the end

29:23.860 --> 29:27.060
that are consumable for people using Linux.

29:27.060 --> 29:30.740
Actually, the concept was started by Gnome,

29:30.740 --> 29:33.020
and they called it the Libre App Summit,

29:33.020 --> 29:36.580
and when we started doing it together with Katie,

29:36.580 --> 29:39.780
we decided to like, let's talk about Linux specifically

29:39.780 --> 29:42.900
and let's do it in a way so that when organizations come,

29:42.900 --> 29:45.460
they know what we're talking about exactly, right?

29:45.460 --> 29:47.460
And why it's about having a free

29:47.460 --> 29:48.860
and open source operating system.

29:48.860 --> 29:50.940
What we want is that all of the contents

29:50.940 --> 29:52.780
that people expect to have on their devices

29:52.780 --> 29:54.860
are available to them.

29:54.860 --> 29:57.500
And we don't want, well, technical reasons

29:57.500 --> 30:01.020
or communication reasons to be why these aren't happening.

30:01.020 --> 30:03.580
So we invite the different organizations

30:03.580 --> 30:07.780
to reach out to us and hear from the people

30:07.780 --> 30:10.220
who have been developing the operating system.

30:10.220 --> 30:11.540
I think that was a nice transition

30:11.540 --> 30:14.420
when it moved from something that was for the Gnome folks

30:14.420 --> 30:17.100
to something that's for Linux users,

30:17.100 --> 30:21.780
Plasma Desktop, Gnome Desktop, i3, whatever it might be.

30:21.780 --> 30:23.940
We want applications for Linux,

30:23.940 --> 30:25.940
and I think that's a good focus.

30:25.940 --> 30:28.220
In the broader case, does that mean more standards?

30:28.220 --> 30:30.980
Does that mean coming together and deciding to do things

30:30.980 --> 30:32.300
as a desktop standard?

30:32.300 --> 30:35.500
Or what do you think ultimately will be action

30:35.500 --> 30:36.660
from something like this?

30:36.660 --> 30:39.940
Well, in general, to find what solution

30:39.940 --> 30:42.380
you need for a problem, you need to get people together

30:42.380 --> 30:43.500
and agree, right?

30:43.500 --> 30:44.580
Right, right, absolutely.

30:44.580 --> 30:45.940
That's why we needed a space

30:45.940 --> 30:47.540
where to have this kind of conversation.

30:47.540 --> 30:49.340
And it's definitely part of that.

30:49.340 --> 30:51.260
Something also that is kind of related,

30:51.260 --> 30:54.660
but not exactly like we were talking

30:54.660 --> 30:56.860
about developers talking, but on LAS,

30:56.860 --> 30:59.820
we also believe that you need to have

30:59.820 --> 31:01.740
a lot different kind of profiles

31:01.740 --> 31:03.700
to approach the Linux community

31:03.700 --> 31:08.340
that goes beyond just the hackers themselves.

31:08.340 --> 31:10.860
And we want to find ways to make sure

31:10.860 --> 31:13.260
that they find the space to collaborate

31:13.260 --> 31:14.740
on the different projects.

31:14.740 --> 31:17.580
And we want to, if you look at the different topics

31:17.580 --> 31:20.620
that we're suggesting people to talk about,

31:20.620 --> 31:23.660
you will see things like legal or promotion.

31:23.660 --> 31:24.980
People need to be able to know

31:24.980 --> 31:28.940
how these are gonna work on Linux on the long run.

31:28.940 --> 31:31.660
Besides, well, the APIs that people are using,

31:31.660 --> 31:33.740
which in the end, I mean, if you're a developer,

31:33.740 --> 31:35.820
you will be able to find the APIs

31:35.820 --> 31:38.940
that you need to use somewhere on the internet, right?

31:38.940 --> 31:42.500
But is all of the content really available

31:42.500 --> 31:43.660
for people to consume?

31:43.660 --> 31:45.100
Well, let's make sure it is.

31:45.100 --> 31:47.660
And that's what LAS is all about.

31:47.660 --> 31:50.140
I think it's a great idea from the concept

31:50.140 --> 31:53.660
of a place to send developers who are Linux curious

31:53.660 --> 31:55.300
and they don't have all the answers.

31:55.300 --> 31:57.300
They don't even know maybe where to look

31:57.300 --> 31:59.420
or what the language is to speak.

31:59.420 --> 32:01.260
And this is something they could attend

32:01.260 --> 32:03.940
and get a pretty good sense of the lay of the ground

32:03.940 --> 32:06.900
and maybe get an idea of how to start developing for Linux.

32:06.900 --> 32:07.740
Yes, for sure.

32:07.740 --> 32:10.220
That's a good way to come from.

32:10.220 --> 32:13.180
Also, if you're coming from a region

32:13.180 --> 32:16.740
that is not very represented on the different communities,

32:16.740 --> 32:20.940
it's a good way to get introduced into the whole concept.

32:22.380 --> 32:25.020
Most free software communities that I know about

32:25.020 --> 32:27.660
are very Western world kind of centric.

32:27.660 --> 32:30.060
And it's something that I think that LAS also

32:30.060 --> 32:35.020
can help a bit to solve by not targeting everyone

32:35.020 --> 32:37.980
into a solution, which myself as a KD person,

32:37.980 --> 32:41.020
I would be happy with getting everything implemented,

32:41.020 --> 32:42.500
but just having this common space

32:42.500 --> 32:44.540
where people can approach and see

32:44.540 --> 32:47.540
how can we bring the Linux things you're creating

32:47.540 --> 32:50.660
into my language, into my locales.

32:50.660 --> 32:52.700
The world is much more complex

32:52.700 --> 32:55.260
than many of us think sometimes.

32:55.260 --> 32:56.740
There's lots of scripts.

32:56.740 --> 32:59.700
There's lots of different perspectives

32:59.700 --> 33:02.380
that we need to make sure that are taken care of.

33:02.380 --> 33:06.420
And we need to have places that they need to feel like

33:06.420 --> 33:08.860
they're not excluding anyone, they just want solutions.

33:08.860 --> 33:12.220
And we are offering a space for there on LAS.

33:12.220 --> 33:13.100
Absolutely.

33:13.100 --> 33:14.500
Well, let's keep up the great work.

33:14.500 --> 33:16.220
Thank you for updating us

33:16.220 --> 33:18.020
when you're in the middle of conferences

33:18.020 --> 33:18.860
and doing all of that.

33:18.860 --> 33:20.140
Don't work yourself too hard.

33:20.140 --> 33:23.100
And here's to a successful Linux app summit.

33:23.100 --> 33:24.220
Oh, thank you very much.

33:24.220 --> 33:25.580
Thanks for joining us.

33:25.580 --> 33:29.100
We'll also, if you wanted to catch the platform,

33:29.100 --> 33:31.260
it's big blue button, we'll have a link to that as well

33:31.260 --> 33:32.100
in the show notes.

33:32.100 --> 33:35.180
Those are at linuxunplug.com slash three seven zero.

33:35.180 --> 33:37.100
We'll have a link to the stuff we talked about

33:37.100 --> 33:39.580
as well as the call for papers.

33:39.580 --> 33:41.460
And now it is time

33:43.020 --> 33:44.420
for a spot of housekeeping.

33:44.420 --> 33:45.620
Long overdue.

33:45.620 --> 33:48.820
You know, it's been getting a little dirty, Wes.

33:48.820 --> 33:51.140
You know, you didn't show up so I didn't bother cleaning

33:51.140 --> 33:52.180
cause you're doing it remote today.

33:52.180 --> 33:53.820
So I thought, oh, I can just let it go.

33:53.820 --> 33:56.260
No, no, housekeeping must go on.

33:56.260 --> 33:57.100
You're right.

33:57.100 --> 33:58.940
It is my fault.

33:58.940 --> 34:00.220
I was trying to make it your fault,

34:00.220 --> 34:02.300
but I just couldn't, I couldn't work the angle.

34:02.300 --> 34:04.140
Now listen here, it's important.

34:04.140 --> 34:05.020
This is important.

34:05.020 --> 34:07.220
We're moving the recording schedule

34:07.220 --> 34:08.260
for one week next week.

34:08.260 --> 34:12.260
We're going on Sunday, this Sunday coming up, big change.

34:12.260 --> 34:13.620
I don't know why I'm saying it weird.

34:13.620 --> 34:15.900
What I'm trying to say is Sunday the 13th,

34:15.900 --> 34:17.900
we're pre-recording for the episode

34:17.900 --> 34:20.180
that would normally be live on the 15th.

34:20.180 --> 34:22.540
I'm taking that week off, trying to do a little downtime,

34:22.540 --> 34:24.700
trying not to do the old burnout thing.

34:24.700 --> 34:26.780
And so we're going to record on Sunday

34:26.780 --> 34:30.260
around 3 p.m. Pacific, which that means 6 p.m. Eastern.

34:30.260 --> 34:31.660
We'd love to have you there.

34:31.660 --> 34:34.420
Show up, hang out in the lup lug at noon

34:34.420 --> 34:37.460
and then just stretch that thing out.

34:37.460 --> 34:38.580
Now tonight as we record,

34:38.580 --> 34:41.340
we're doing the Bugathon for Fedora 33.

34:41.340 --> 34:43.300
We want to explore this idea further

34:43.300 --> 34:46.100
and maybe see if we can't take it to future projects.

34:46.100 --> 34:46.940
I don't know.

34:46.940 --> 34:48.780
We'll probably talk about it tonight actually,

34:48.780 --> 34:51.100
but I'd like to call on the community in the meantime

34:51.100 --> 34:54.940
to keep joining the Bugathon room on our matrix server.

34:54.940 --> 34:56.300
I want to make a persistent space

34:56.300 --> 34:59.380
where developers can reach out to willing and able testers

34:59.380 --> 35:00.220
in the Bugathon room.

35:00.220 --> 35:03.660
Essentially a spot where they can search for it.

35:03.660 --> 35:05.500
It's a beautiful thing in matrix and they can find it

35:05.500 --> 35:07.860
and they can go in there and boom,

35:07.860 --> 35:10.420
a group of people willing to help them test something.

35:10.420 --> 35:13.420
Imagine just even that as a resource for developers

35:13.420 --> 35:14.660
where they can reach users

35:14.660 --> 35:16.860
when they need another set of eyes.

35:16.860 --> 35:18.540
Also taking future projects

35:18.540 --> 35:21.980
that we could do as a Bugathon in that room.

35:21.980 --> 35:23.380
So that'll be the place to stay up to date

35:23.380 --> 35:24.220
on future developments.

35:24.220 --> 35:26.540
We'd love to hear from open source project leaders

35:26.540 --> 35:27.780
or developers who have any ideas

35:27.780 --> 35:30.460
on how we could utilize this community powered

35:30.460 --> 35:32.260
bug testing better.

35:32.260 --> 35:34.060
All of that, you can either email me,

35:34.060 --> 35:36.240
chris at jupyterbroadcasting.com

35:36.240 --> 35:39.960
or join the Bugathon room on our matrix server

35:39.960 --> 35:41.280
and chat with us about it in there

35:41.280 --> 35:43.940
because I think this is something,

35:43.940 --> 35:45.180
I've got a lot of big ideas,

35:45.180 --> 35:47.420
but I want to do it the right way.

35:47.420 --> 35:48.640
Measure twice, cut once

35:48.640 --> 35:51.180
and do something that truly makes a difference.

35:51.180 --> 35:54.060
And I think I'll also just plug while we're wrapping it up,

35:54.060 --> 35:56.700
Wes joined us on Coder Radio this week.

35:56.700 --> 35:57.740
So check out Coder Radio,

35:57.740 --> 35:59.300
they'll be releasing just like a day or so

35:59.300 --> 36:01.180
after we publish this episode.

36:01.180 --> 36:02.540
Yeah, that was a lot of fun.

36:02.540 --> 36:04.180
Yeah, thanks for doing that.

36:04.180 --> 36:06.140
That's what Wes spent his Labor Day doing.

36:06.140 --> 36:07.780
It was podcasting.

36:07.780 --> 36:09.860
I can't think of anything better than debating the merits

36:09.860 --> 36:11.700
of C++ with you and Mike.

36:12.660 --> 36:14.780
That's exactly what we did.

36:14.780 --> 36:17.180
So check out coder.show for that.

36:19.780 --> 36:21.840
Thank you to our unplugged core contributors

36:21.840 --> 36:24.380
who are making these shows possible really.

36:24.380 --> 36:25.460
This is our core.

36:25.460 --> 36:26.980
This is the foundation of the show

36:26.980 --> 36:29.540
that makes it possible to continue production

36:29.540 --> 36:31.340
if we lose sponsorships

36:31.340 --> 36:33.920
or help us offset the need for sponsors.

36:33.920 --> 36:35.420
And it keeps us independent.

36:35.420 --> 36:38.540
So I really want to say thank you to the core contributors,

36:38.540 --> 36:41.620
unpluggedcore.com if you're interested in signing up.

36:41.620 --> 36:43.220
You get access to two feeds.

36:43.220 --> 36:45.780
Feed one is the ad-free

36:45.780 --> 36:49.580
or maybe more appropriate, limited ad-free feed

36:49.580 --> 36:51.460
because there are some ads that are short

36:51.460 --> 36:53.260
but contractually obligated to be in there.

36:53.260 --> 36:55.900
But there's otherwise, it's the fully produced show,

36:55.900 --> 36:59.460
fully mixed and just less ads.

36:59.460 --> 37:00.580
We cut what we can.

37:00.580 --> 37:02.100
Yeah, and you get the clean audio.

37:02.100 --> 37:04.220
So if we have somebody on,

37:04.220 --> 37:07.100
Drew works on spicing that stuff up and making it sweet,

37:07.100 --> 37:08.020
that's all in there.

37:08.020 --> 37:11.020
But if you'd rather have just the bootleg copy

37:11.020 --> 37:13.740
of the entire stream, which is often much longer

37:13.740 --> 37:15.860
and has lots of interesting conversations

37:15.860 --> 37:17.860
that are a little more of the off-air variety,

37:17.860 --> 37:19.660
that's feed two, the full live stream.

37:19.660 --> 37:20.500
All our screw-ups,

37:20.500 --> 37:22.580
the stuff that never really makes it into the show,

37:22.580 --> 37:23.820
that's all in that feed.

37:23.820 --> 37:25.640
So you get feed one or feed two,

37:25.640 --> 37:27.900
and that's available when you become

37:27.900 --> 37:30.380
a unplugged core contributor as a thank you.

37:30.380 --> 37:33.160
And that's at unpluggedcore.com.

37:33.160 --> 37:35.840
The real question is, do you want the Drew magic

37:35.840 --> 37:37.580
or do you want all the mess-ups?

37:37.580 --> 37:41.420
Yeah, you know, or do the AB thing,

37:41.420 --> 37:43.300
which it would actually be a really,

37:43.300 --> 37:44.740
I think it would help people appreciate

37:44.740 --> 37:46.200
the work that goes into it,

37:46.200 --> 37:49.260
is subscribe, get the live version feed,

37:49.260 --> 37:51.740
and then compare it to the version published on the website.

37:51.740 --> 37:54.400
And I think you'll see quite the difference.

37:54.400 --> 37:56.260
Also still taking input for Linux Prepper,

37:56.260 --> 37:57.260
I should mention that too.

37:57.260 --> 37:59.060
But I wanted to get into our feedback

38:00.140 --> 38:02.580
because we've gotten some good ones recently

38:02.580 --> 38:05.820
and we wanted to get through at least a batch of these

38:05.820 --> 38:07.020
and then maybe hold another batch

38:07.020 --> 38:08.460
so we can also do picks.

38:08.460 --> 38:10.920
Let's start with a mention with a community book club.

38:10.920 --> 38:12.780
Yes, a community book club.

38:12.780 --> 38:15.380
The group will do a read of Jono Bacon's people-powered book

38:15.380 --> 38:16.960
with a discussion on Slack

38:16.960 --> 38:19.700
and a weekly QA session with Jono.

38:19.700 --> 38:22.520
The book club, which takes place entirely online,

38:22.520 --> 38:25.700
is free and will run from October 6th to December 15th.

38:25.700 --> 38:27.060
So you do the math on that.

38:27.060 --> 38:30.180
Q&A calls every Tuesday at 9 a.m. Pacific time.

38:30.180 --> 38:31.460
Wow, that's quite the day.

38:31.460 --> 38:32.860
You do your book club Q&A,

38:32.860 --> 38:34.760
then you do your unplugged live.

38:34.760 --> 38:36.500
Sign-ups are open until October 2nd

38:36.500 --> 38:38.980
and further information like the Slack group and stuff

38:38.980 --> 38:40.580
will be emailed to participants closer

38:40.580 --> 38:41.820
to when the Q&A starts.

38:41.820 --> 38:45.180
But if you're interested in community

38:45.180 --> 38:46.700
and making your existing community better,

38:46.700 --> 38:49.420
Jono's kind of become the source on this stuff.

38:49.420 --> 38:51.580
So I'll have a link to that in the show notes.

38:51.580 --> 38:53.860
And I guess it's a freebie way to listen to the book, right?

38:53.860 --> 38:55.940
Yeah, and I mean like talk to folks

38:55.940 --> 38:56.980
that are interested in other people

38:56.980 --> 38:58.860
working at building and maintaining communities.

38:58.860 --> 39:00.300
Sounds like a good resource.

39:00.300 --> 39:01.140
Yeah, and troll Jono.

39:01.140 --> 39:03.140
So that's totally worth it, really, if you think about it.

39:03.140 --> 39:05.380
Well, that's why you'll be there.

39:05.380 --> 39:07.540
All right, our first email comes in from Jake,

39:07.540 --> 39:08.820
and he says, hey guys,

39:08.820 --> 39:10.740
congratulations on becoming independent again.

39:10.740 --> 39:14.420
Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.

39:14.420 --> 39:16.620
He says, I was curious if you've ever considered

39:16.620 --> 39:19.260
trying Alpine on the garage server.

39:19.260 --> 39:23.260
It has Docker and ZFS availability natively.

39:23.260 --> 39:24.580
And he says, thanks for hanging through

39:24.580 --> 39:26.860
what must have been some trying times, Jake.

39:26.860 --> 39:28.500
Jake says we should use Alpine.

39:28.500 --> 39:29.780
What do you think of that?

39:29.780 --> 39:31.300
Ooh, you know, I didn't realize

39:31.300 --> 39:33.540
that it had ZFS easily available.

39:33.540 --> 39:36.340
That's never a bad thing, is it?

39:36.340 --> 39:37.340
I didn't realize that either.

39:37.340 --> 39:38.580
Now, that would be taking things

39:38.580 --> 39:40.340
to the next minimal level, I think.

39:40.340 --> 39:43.580
Certainly, we've used tons of containers powered by Alpine.

39:43.580 --> 39:45.740
As a full-fledged server, I don't know,

39:45.740 --> 39:47.220
maybe it's worth a shot.

39:47.220 --> 39:49.740
Well, it doesn't have that same kind of,

39:51.540 --> 39:53.820
doing 85 on a motorcycle down the freeway

39:53.820 --> 39:56.460
with no helmet on kind of feel that our Arch server does.

39:56.460 --> 39:58.940
Right, well, and the other thing too is,

39:58.940 --> 40:00.340
using Arch, you gotta piece it together.

40:00.340 --> 40:03.500
But we often fall back on that there Arch Wiki,

40:03.500 --> 40:04.860
which is a huge resource.

40:04.860 --> 40:06.380
I could see it though.

40:06.380 --> 40:08.380
Especially for something like a Raspberry Pi

40:08.380 --> 40:11.660
or a really low-end NUC that is just an appliance,

40:11.660 --> 40:13.100
that could be the OS to go with.

40:13.100 --> 40:15.180
I could definitely see it making sense.

40:15.180 --> 40:17.500
Daniel writes in with questions about remote office.

40:17.500 --> 40:19.660
He says, sorry in advance for being a noob.

40:19.660 --> 40:21.620
On one of your shows, you talked about

40:21.620 --> 40:26.300
how you linked your RV to the studio's office network.

40:26.300 --> 40:28.020
I have looked for more info on this

40:28.020 --> 40:29.820
and I'm hitting a brick wall.

40:29.820 --> 40:32.180
I have satellite internet at both my office and home

40:32.180 --> 40:35.180
and I'd like to get SSH access to my work computer

40:35.180 --> 40:37.060
and access some shared drives.

40:37.060 --> 40:40.540
Both my desktop and my laptop run Pop OS

40:40.540 --> 40:42.260
and I've never looked back.

40:42.260 --> 40:44.420
Without going any longer into my background,

40:44.420 --> 40:46.420
this is all to say I have a pretty good understanding

40:46.420 --> 40:48.020
of basic programming and networking

40:48.020 --> 40:51.180
from about the mid-90s, but I've been a little out of touch.

40:51.180 --> 40:52.940
So my question is, if I have a droplet

40:52.940 --> 40:54.780
that's running a mail server,

40:54.780 --> 40:57.500
could I use that for this project?

40:57.500 --> 40:59.300
I know I haven't given you a lot of information,

40:59.300 --> 41:00.940
but maybe you guys can help.

41:00.940 --> 41:02.660
Well, Wes, I think he's just about onto it.

41:02.660 --> 41:03.860
I think you just need to connect the dots

41:03.860 --> 41:05.100
for Daniel on this one.

41:05.100 --> 41:05.940
Yeah, right?

41:05.940 --> 41:06.780
I mean, we're doing a couple of things.

41:06.780 --> 41:09.540
Probably primarily would be leveraging WireGuard,

41:09.540 --> 41:12.980
which is just sort of our own VPN of choice these days.

41:12.980 --> 41:15.260
And then also something you and Alex talked about

41:15.260 --> 41:19.060
in self-hosted episode 24 would be that handy little

41:19.060 --> 41:22.380
remote forwarding SSH where you forward the SSH port

41:22.380 --> 41:25.740
from one of your pies in your mobile RV

41:25.740 --> 41:27.420
up to a droplet that we've got running

41:27.420 --> 41:29.580
and then you can access that from anywhere.

41:29.580 --> 41:30.660
That's really the trick.

41:30.660 --> 41:32.700
And I love it so much that now I've set it up

41:32.700 --> 41:36.420
on my son's computer, I just put on everything now

41:36.420 --> 41:38.420
and I just have it right there as another port

41:38.420 --> 41:40.740
and I just change ports and one port number

41:40.740 --> 41:42.060
equals this machine in my head,

41:42.060 --> 41:44.060
one port number equals my other machine in my head

41:44.060 --> 41:47.940
and it works so well that I use it on the regular for SSH.

41:47.940 --> 41:50.860
Now, WireGuard ultimately would be the simpler solution

41:50.860 --> 41:53.020
if that would work with your satellite internet provider

41:53.020 --> 41:55.660
because then you could talk to the machine

41:55.660 --> 41:58.980
with just with anything, like if you wanted to do SFTP

41:58.980 --> 42:00.460
or if you wanted to do Samba,

42:00.460 --> 42:02.060
you could do any kind of file transfer.

42:02.060 --> 42:03.780
So WireGuard might be the preferred solution

42:03.780 --> 42:06.700
but you could totally do it with SSH jump hosts.

42:06.700 --> 42:08.660
Yeah, and if it wasn't clear, that's what we're doing here.

42:08.660 --> 42:10.380
I would definitely argue

42:10.380 --> 42:12.500
for a virtual private network myself.

42:12.500 --> 42:13.980
I mean, that's what they're for.

42:13.980 --> 42:15.140
Yeah, that'll give you full,

42:15.140 --> 42:17.140
it's like you've actually joined the networks together,

42:17.140 --> 42:18.540
you're on the same network.

42:18.540 --> 42:20.420
The SSH thing is really just sort of

42:20.420 --> 42:22.380
an convenient little hack when all you need

42:22.380 --> 42:24.700
is remote SSH access and you've already got

42:24.700 --> 42:26.540
a public VPS somewhere.

42:26.540 --> 42:29.540
I mean, you could also do a little port forwarding.

42:29.540 --> 42:31.820
You could do some things.

42:31.820 --> 42:34.020
But yeah, WireGuard really would be the way to go.

42:34.020 --> 42:35.220
Check the show notes too,

42:35.220 --> 42:39.180
Wes is dropping in a link to a secure SSH tunnel

42:39.180 --> 42:42.580
as a system D unit, which the trick there

42:42.580 --> 42:43.940
is when your system comes up,

42:43.940 --> 42:46.420
it just automatically establishes that tunnel for you

42:46.420 --> 42:49.020
on the back end and leaves it persistently connected.

42:49.020 --> 42:50.900
And if your network goes out,

42:50.900 --> 42:53.060
it can also help reconnect that automatically

42:53.060 --> 42:54.260
without you having to do anything.

42:54.260 --> 42:55.980
So Daniel, when you're looking for

42:55.980 --> 42:56.980
that remote office solution,

42:56.980 --> 42:58.780
do check out that link Wes just dropped in there.

42:58.780 --> 43:01.260
Yeah, it's also pretty handy for remote support.

43:01.260 --> 43:03.420
Maybe you don't need to establish a full VPN tunnel,

43:03.420 --> 43:05.700
but you've got a family member whose laptop's running Linux

43:05.700 --> 43:07.500
and you need, occasionally you gotta jump in there

43:07.500 --> 43:08.780
to do some troubleshooting.

43:08.780 --> 43:10.020
That's a handy way to do it too.

43:10.020 --> 43:13.740
Yeah, I think it was just a month or five ago that,

43:13.740 --> 43:15.420
oh yeah, it was a little bit ago.

43:15.420 --> 43:19.620
But my son was preparing for school from home

43:19.620 --> 43:23.180
and he needed a dependency to install some app they use,

43:23.180 --> 43:24.660
it might've even been Zoom.

43:24.660 --> 43:27.060
And I just didn't really feel like walking him

43:27.060 --> 43:29.060
through the process of app installing

43:29.060 --> 43:31.820
when his mom's standing there over the computer,

43:31.820 --> 43:33.540
they want it done, the teacher's waiting.

43:33.540 --> 43:37.220
I just fired off the SSH connection through that tunnel,

43:37.220 --> 43:39.780
jumped on his box, pseudo-app installed the package,

43:39.780 --> 43:41.060
got it all going for him in seconds

43:41.060 --> 43:42.420
and they were able to just launch the app.

43:42.420 --> 43:43.980
It was really a quick resolution.

43:43.980 --> 43:45.980
And that's just a high level of support

43:45.980 --> 43:47.860
you could offer with Linux if you use the tools.

43:47.860 --> 43:50.060
Like it doesn't have remote desktop RDP,

43:50.060 --> 43:51.660
I couldn't RDP into it,

43:51.660 --> 43:53.620
but I sure solved the problem awful quick.

43:53.620 --> 43:54.460
All right, well thank you

43:54.460 --> 43:56.460
for going to linuxunplug.com slash contact

43:56.460 --> 43:57.420
and sending those in.

43:57.420 --> 43:59.500
We have a couple of more for next episode

43:59.500 --> 44:01.140
since we're doing a prerecord, we're saving a couple.

44:01.140 --> 44:03.420
So if you didn't hear yours answered, stay tuned,

44:03.420 --> 44:05.740
but you do get a taco either way.

44:05.740 --> 44:08.020
All right, why don't we do a few picks before we go?

44:08.020 --> 44:10.740
Because everyone needs this first pick.

44:10.740 --> 44:13.740
And I think it's kind of a essential service

44:13.740 --> 44:16.620
to the community that we call this one out

44:16.620 --> 44:19.100
because I know this is what you've been waiting for,

44:19.100 --> 44:22.380
a spreadsheet program that's end curses.

44:22.380 --> 44:24.060
Yeah, right, who doesn't want that?

44:24.060 --> 44:26.340
Tired of loading up a bloated GUI all the time,

44:26.340 --> 44:28.780
you just need to calculate a few rows here and there?

44:28.780 --> 44:32.780
No longer, at least with SCIM.

44:32.780 --> 44:34.780
You really got a good pitch down for that.

44:34.780 --> 44:36.180
They should contact you.

44:37.780 --> 44:40.820
Tired of those bloated graphical spreadsheet programs?

44:40.820 --> 44:43.220
Go back to the days of Lotus.

44:43.220 --> 44:44.060
Well, I mean, you know,

44:44.060 --> 44:47.100
a spreadsheet's just like a 2D interface anyway.

44:47.100 --> 44:47.940
For sure.

44:47.940 --> 44:49.700
A bunch of columns of text and numbers.

44:49.700 --> 44:50.860
That's kind of perfect.

44:50.860 --> 44:53.540
And don't we always love a good end curses pick?

44:53.540 --> 44:54.500
Yes, always.

44:54.500 --> 44:56.260
We should have an end curses jingle, actually.

44:56.260 --> 44:57.260
We love it so much.

44:57.260 --> 44:59.060
Now you might laugh, but you should stay around.

44:59.060 --> 45:00.460
Check this pick out just enough

45:00.460 --> 45:01.940
to see their charting support

45:01.940 --> 45:04.020
because that kind of blew me away.

45:04.020 --> 45:06.420
Oh, you're right.

45:06.420 --> 45:08.460
That's legitimately rad.

45:08.460 --> 45:10.180
All right, well, you'll have to check the link

45:10.180 --> 45:11.260
in the show notes to see that one

45:11.260 --> 45:13.220
because while we're talking about things

45:13.220 --> 45:15.020
that you always are going to want to do

45:15.020 --> 45:17.060
on the command line, obviously,

45:17.060 --> 45:20.340
that would be presentations, of course.

45:20.340 --> 45:22.260
You want to present on the command line.

45:22.260 --> 45:24.620
And that's where this next pick comes in.

45:24.620 --> 45:27.700
It's simply called present.

45:27.700 --> 45:31.420
And well, I mean, it supports as schematics.

45:31.420 --> 45:33.980
So you could have some animations, I think.

45:33.980 --> 45:35.580
Yeah, I mean, it's got colors.

45:35.580 --> 45:36.660
It's got effects.

45:36.660 --> 45:38.340
It's honestly one of the best.

45:38.340 --> 45:41.900
I've been looking around for a quote unquote full feature

45:41.900 --> 45:43.860
at least as far as you can get presentation tool

45:43.860 --> 45:45.020
for the command line.

45:45.020 --> 45:46.420
You know, sometimes you got to demo stuff.

45:46.420 --> 45:47.260
You're making some changes.

45:47.260 --> 45:49.220
You got a new project you're trying to show off.

45:49.220 --> 45:50.180
If you're going to be doing that stuff

45:50.180 --> 45:51.300
on the terminal anyway,

45:51.300 --> 45:53.100
why have to switch back and forth between like,

45:53.100 --> 45:54.860
you know, whatever you're using Google services,

45:54.860 --> 45:57.340
or maybe you've got the LibreOffice presentation suite

45:57.340 --> 45:58.300
installed.

45:58.300 --> 45:59.300
Nah, none of that.

45:59.300 --> 46:02.380
This is just a simple Python app pip install present

46:02.380 --> 46:03.580
and away you go.

46:03.580 --> 46:04.420
You know what, Wes?

46:04.420 --> 46:09.460
It is no less ridiculous than all of your core applications

46:09.460 --> 46:11.060
being different tabs in a web browser.

46:11.060 --> 46:12.060
No, exactly.

46:12.060 --> 46:13.740
And I mean, it's powered by Markdown, right?

46:13.740 --> 46:15.340
So if you're already familiar with writing stuff

46:15.340 --> 46:17.900
in Markdown, that's kind of how I plan out my notes

46:17.900 --> 46:19.100
for presentations anyway.

46:19.100 --> 46:21.420
And if I can just leverage that without having to copy that

46:21.420 --> 46:23.820
and reformat it, drag boxes around in a GUI

46:23.820 --> 46:25.900
and just have a basic presentation,

46:25.900 --> 46:27.340
no, it won't work for everything.

46:27.340 --> 46:29.940
But for just simple internal facing presentations

46:29.940 --> 46:31.260
with a bunch of other nerds,

46:31.260 --> 46:32.980
I think it might actually be useful.

46:32.980 --> 46:36.140
So everyone on the Zoom call, I am using Wayland.

46:36.140 --> 46:37.540
So I can't share my screen.

46:37.540 --> 46:41.380
So please SSH in and join my team up session.

46:41.380 --> 46:43.940
And we will look at this presentation together.

46:43.940 --> 46:46.260
There's only one organization I think that would fly in

46:46.260 --> 46:47.580
and it would be JB.

46:47.580 --> 46:48.700
That would be the only place we'd be like,

46:48.700 --> 46:50.460
oh yeah, cool, no problem.

46:50.460 --> 46:51.300
That's really neat.

46:51.300 --> 46:52.940
How are you doing that?

46:52.940 --> 46:55.460
Am I dating us, Brent, by talking about Lotus?

46:55.460 --> 46:56.420
You know, the good old days?

46:56.420 --> 46:58.260
Yeah, I think a little bit, but many of us,

46:58.260 --> 46:59.340
well, I say that.

46:59.340 --> 47:00.700
I'm just trying to make myself feel better.

47:00.700 --> 47:02.940
One of the first, first applications I ever used

47:02.940 --> 47:05.140
was a spreadsheet program on the fan line

47:05.140 --> 47:06.620
with Commodore 64 stuff.

47:06.620 --> 47:10.140
My father tracked our allowance when we were kids in there

47:10.140 --> 47:11.940
and we had to use it otherwise we didn't get it.

47:11.940 --> 47:15.260
So that was quite nostalgic.

47:15.260 --> 47:17.900
Wow, tracked the, you know,

47:17.900 --> 47:20.380
I kind of remember something similar back in the day

47:20.380 --> 47:22.740
as my dad tracked the family finances

47:22.740 --> 47:24.420
in a DOS-based spreadsheet.

47:24.420 --> 47:26.900
It just, it all looked like wizardry to me.

47:26.900 --> 47:28.180
See you next week.

47:28.180 --> 47:30.860
Same bat time, same bat station.

47:30.860 --> 47:31.900
Well, this would normally be the point

47:31.900 --> 47:33.400
where I'd plug the live stream next week,

47:33.400 --> 47:36.260
but I'm heading off into the woods or maybe the coast.

47:36.260 --> 47:37.260
I'm not sure yet.

47:37.260 --> 47:38.260
Taking a little downtime.

47:38.260 --> 47:39.860
So we're pre-recording, like I mentioned,

47:39.860 --> 47:41.440
on this coming Sunday.

47:41.440 --> 47:46.300
But if you're subscribed, like 98%, 99% of you that listen,

47:46.300 --> 47:48.940
almost making it not even worth me mentioning right now,

47:48.940 --> 47:50.220
nothing will really change for you.

47:50.220 --> 47:51.460
It's pretty much gonna be the same.

47:51.460 --> 47:55.540
So linuxunplug.com slash 370 to go get more of that.

47:55.540 --> 47:57.020
Thank you to Drew and Wes

47:57.020 --> 47:58.560
and thank you to the Mumble Room.

47:58.560 --> 48:01.380
Thank you to Elish and Wim for joining us as well.

48:01.380 --> 48:03.140
And thank you to our core contributors

48:03.140 --> 48:04.820
who are helping make the show possible.

48:04.820 --> 48:06.460
And thanks to all of you for listening.

48:06.460 --> 48:11.460
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

48:11.460 --> 48:38.560
fait.

48:41.460 --> 48:57.220
I wanted to get the Virtual Lugs take on a blog post over at HawaiiGentech.com about

48:57.220 --> 49:02.460
why I, this is the author, why I linked to the Wayback Machine instead of the original

49:02.460 --> 49:03.460
site.

49:03.460 --> 49:06.820
They write, when linking to a page for the purposes of reference, like we do in the show

49:06.820 --> 49:11.500
notes all the time, it seems better to me to link to an archive version of a given page

49:11.500 --> 49:14.120
rather than to the original site itself.

49:14.120 --> 49:18.780
This ensures that after some years have gone by, my article is guaranteed to be consistent.

49:18.780 --> 49:22.100
Due to the changing nature of the web, there is a chance that after some years, the link

49:22.100 --> 49:27.040
could lead to a 404 not found, changed or edited content or entirely replaced, content

49:27.040 --> 49:31.020
that has been due to a rise in popularity is now shielded behind a paywall demanding

49:31.020 --> 49:33.900
a user account or even pay for it.

49:33.900 --> 49:38.300
Whereas linking to the archive is probably more authoritative than linking to dynamic,

49:38.300 --> 49:40.460
changeable web content.

49:40.460 --> 49:46.540
And then the author sites where some new sites on all sides have made changes after the fact

49:46.540 --> 49:50.820
with no notice of updates or anything and then it made their article irrelevant they're

49:50.820 --> 49:52.280
referencing to.

49:52.280 --> 49:58.840
And archive.org is a great way to just kind of link to an official always will work version

49:58.840 --> 50:00.740
of a website.

50:00.740 --> 50:02.180
Think about it in the context of our podcast.

50:02.180 --> 50:09.800
So instead of linking to Foronix or OMG Ubuntu or LWN, we would link to archive.org's Wayback

50:09.800 --> 50:11.740
Machine version of their thing.

50:11.740 --> 50:16.940
I've used Wayback Machine a couple of times, but it doesn't capture all dates, right?

50:16.940 --> 50:19.780
Can you manually trigger to capture a website?

50:19.780 --> 50:24.360
Yeah, I think there is a way to submit something to the Wayback Machine and it grabs a capture

50:24.360 --> 50:25.360
of it that day.

50:25.360 --> 50:26.360
Okay.

50:26.360 --> 50:27.360
Yeah, that Yeah, right.

50:27.360 --> 50:32.740
I would agree with you that linking to a Wayback link indeed is more secure.

50:32.740 --> 50:42.460
I've had oftentimes I remember now for school we were using an API framework called loopback

50:42.460 --> 50:48.220
and we had to push it to IBM cloud and they also use that from documentation on a different

50:48.220 --> 50:49.220
website.

50:49.220 --> 50:52.900
And when you were Googling for instructions or something was going wrong and you were

50:52.900 --> 50:56.260
Googling for stuff to help you out, it would link it to a forum.

50:56.260 --> 51:00.820
And when you click on that forum, they were mentioning, oh, this is the old link.

51:00.820 --> 51:04.660
We've moved to this forum, but all the old posts were archived.

51:04.660 --> 51:10.660
They no longer exist on the new forum and having a Wayback Machine link would have been

51:10.660 --> 51:11.660
handier in that case.

51:11.660 --> 51:14.020
Yeah, I'm a big fan of the Wayback Machine.

51:14.020 --> 51:15.340
I mean, it's been around forever.

51:15.340 --> 51:19.460
But in my experience, every time I go to use it, there's, you know, there's some text there

51:19.460 --> 51:21.220
and some basic images and stuff.

51:21.220 --> 51:24.420
I remember looking at one of Popeys old websites with cats on it.

51:24.420 --> 51:27.660
A lot of the usability kind of goes away.

51:27.660 --> 51:32.060
There's some fancy features in, you know, modern web that don't always translate it.

51:32.060 --> 51:37.020
I think maybe that would be a bad user experience in some cases when, you know, some websites

51:37.020 --> 51:39.900
were looking to have some pretty neat stuff going on.

51:39.900 --> 51:42.980
I just wanted you to know that I did catch that you're using the Wayback Machine to look

51:42.980 --> 51:43.980
at Popeys cats.

51:43.980 --> 51:44.980
I did catch that.

51:44.980 --> 51:45.980
All right.

51:45.980 --> 51:46.980
All right.

51:46.980 --> 51:59.980
That's all.
