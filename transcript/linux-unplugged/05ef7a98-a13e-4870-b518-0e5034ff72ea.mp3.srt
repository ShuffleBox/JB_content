1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
So Rekai has a story to share with the class

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,540
that surprised me.

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,900
That it impacted the release of User Error.

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:12,200
And it's a significant trying times we live in, Wes,

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,180
when a problem like this exists

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,100
and no one steps up to solve it.

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,340
One man must come to the people,

8
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,340
must inform the people of the duty we must all take,

9
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,420
the R-syncs that we must all pick up,

10
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,820
and the scripts that must be written.

11
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,260
What happened, Beard?

12
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,460
I want to know why Ubuntu still sucks.

13
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,500
Oh!

14
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,340
Darn!

15
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,180
Oh!

16
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,020
Say it!

17
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,580
Well, to be fair, to be fair, Debbie and Two,

18
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,860
I want to know why in 2017,

19
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:47,060
we do not have the ability to automatically check

20
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,960
and see if our mirrors are up to date.

21
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,920
Because I had to,

22
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,600
I figured out this problem later.

23
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,940
I had to install TeamViewer

24
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,940
and TeamViewer would not installed

25
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,540
because it was missing packages.

26
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:03,580
There's your first mistake.

27
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,540
That's your first problem.

28
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,380
Oh, I had to be that guy.

29
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,420
We all had to be that guy.

30
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,100
Well, you know, give me another easy remote desktop solution

31
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,500
that doesn't require forwarding ports.

32
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,340
I will today.

33
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,180
Oh.

34
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,400
Well, that is what I will give you today,

35
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,420
but except for that last part,

36
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,900
you will have to forward port 22.

37
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,780
But, so I couldn't install TeamViewer.

38
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,620
It was telling me that packages were missing.

39
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:28,420
I assumed it was just because packages had changed in 17.10.

40
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,580
But no, it turns out,

41
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,780
I found out completely unrelatedly later

42
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:36,780
that the mirror that had been chosen for my Ubuntu install.

43
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,260
So like when I installed,

44
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,380
because that's the install I set up.

45
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,220
Yeah.

46
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,040
I didn't change the mirrors.

47
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,880
I didn't change any of that stuff.

48
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,760
Well, whatever it defaulted to had out of date packages

49
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,560
because later I switched to a different mirror

50
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,820
for an unrelated reason and it resolved everything.

51
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,660
Everything was fine again.

52
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,020
Now, do you think this is...

53
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,500
Is this, do you need graphical access to the machine

54
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,500
or are you remotely controlling a Windows machine

55
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,300
or is this, is SSH enough without port forwarding?

56
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,140
No, it doesn't.

57
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:06,960
I need graphical access.

58
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,800
Do you need the desktop?

59
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,340
Which I have a solution for today's show,

60
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,100
but except for his specific scenario,

61
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,760
he needed the logged in sessions desktop.

62
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,660
Yep.

63
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,720
Right.

64
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,300
Which is definitely a little trickier.

65
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,140
TeamViewer's not bad.

66
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,020
X11.

67
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,860
We've talked about Splashtop before.

68
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,780
If you, so today what we're gonna talk about

69
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,820
is if you just want a remote desktop session

70
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,780
that you can connect to and disconnect from

71
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,260
and that session remains like running on the computer.

72
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,100
Yeah.

73
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:36,100
See, the thing about TeamViewer is I installed TeamViewer,

74
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,020
I logged into my account,

75
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:42,100
I clicked three boxes for unattended remote access

76
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,060
and then I left and I was able to connect on the other end.

77
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,620
So how, wait, so I gotta go back.

78
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,600
How did you discover that it was out of date packages?

79
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,540
Like I'm not clear on that.

80
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,820
So you came to the conclusion that the repo

81
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,780
hadn't like synced after 17.10 or something?

82
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,020
Like they just didn't have the right version

83
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,300
that supported Ubuntu 17.10?

84
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,660
It was 17.10 packages

85
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,500
because clearly it was getting packages from somewhere.

86
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,340
Yeah, that's true.

87
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,180
But some of the packages it was saying

88
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,620
are referenced but don't exist on this mirror or whatever.

89
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,780
And others. Oh, really?

90
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,380
Yeah, others.

91
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,980
And when I did a apt-get upgrade,

92
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,280
it updated a couple of packages,

93
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,880
but not as many as you would expect after a release.

94
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,540
And then later I switched to a different mirror

95
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,740
and I had a whole lot more updates

96
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,740
and it solved the missing packages for TeamViewer

97
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,620
because TeamViewer was like half installed.

98
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,240
Because it was like, you know,

99
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,460
it's installed but we're missing dependencies.

100
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,540
See, this is, we have to rally the people

101
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,140
because there's only one thing that can be done.

102
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,020
So I'm just wondering why like in the process of,

103
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,340
you know, checking for new packages,

104
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,420
why aren't they checking the freshness of a mirror?

105
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,420
This is your cause now.

106
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:49,060
Mirror freshness is like your mission in life

107
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,820
to make sure it stays fresh, I guess.

108
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,980
Maybe it's just easier to blame Popeye.

109
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,740
So I've just, yeah, sure.

110
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,260
And I've just posted a link that tells you

111
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,340
how up-to-date each of the mirrors are.

112
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,340
Yeah, but what I'm asking is,

113
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,980
why is this not part of the automatic process?

114
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,980
I didn't realize this could be a thing, actually.

115
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,940
To be honest with you, I didn't-

116
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,300
It usually isn't.

117
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,540
It typically isn't because there isn't a gigantic churn

118
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,180
like there is at release time

119
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,980
when hundreds of machines around the world

120
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,780
are all hitting the same machine,

121
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,580
trying to update at the same time.

122
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,420
Okay, yeah, so I see here-

123
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,460
I suspect you probably happen to hit

124
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,700
the wrong time of the year for it, and that's all.

125
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,880
Yeah, so it looks like there's one mirror

126
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,140
that's a week behind, one that's two days behind.

127
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,540
Most are all up to date, but yeah, this does,

128
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,780
this is actually a pretty good thing to know.

129
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,660
So that is launchpad.net slash Ubuntu

130
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,600
slash plus archive mirrors, plus symbol archive mirrors.

131
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,740
Cool, thanks, Popeye.

132
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,460
I'll toss a link to that in the show notes.

133
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,420
Sweet.

134
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,940
I literally had no idea that was an issue

135
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,640
because I just assumed these things

136
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,140
slowly are synced to the background,

137
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,360
but of course that's me being naive

138
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,580
about the size of the data that they're moving around.

139
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,820
They actually usually really quickly

140
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,260
are synced in the background

141
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,980
because they've all got stupidly fat connections

142
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,340
to the internet.

143
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,180
Yeah.

144
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,000
Actually, I think I ran into that

145
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,680
the other week as well, and then later it's like,

146
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,700
oh yeah, everything's there now, all right, that's fine.

147
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,340
You see, this is why I prefer boutique distributions

148
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,340
because their small user base means

149
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,580
that they can just download everything off a single mirror

150
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,980
and I don't actually have anything, I'm just making that up.

151
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,500
Actually, there's something to be said for simplicity

152
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,580
is when you've got like a giant complex arrangement

153
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,540
of moving parts, things can go wrong.

154
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,380
Well, that's why-

155
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,200
I mean, when no one uses your software,

156
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,700
it's really easy to maintain.

157
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,740
Or you take the Linux Mint approach

158
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,560
and you just outsource that extremely complicated,

159
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,500
massively expensive part of your infrastructure

160
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,580
to somebody else, you know, that's like-

161
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,980
Even look at like what Aiki just went through

162
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,700
with his upsizing.

163
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,380
You know, he pretty much got banged offline

164
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,460
with his OVH server and then he had to go hunting

165
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,020
for a CDN like as quick as he could.

166
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,020
See, I guess what I'm asking is why don't they have,

167
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,100
like when you do an app get update,

168
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:07,940
it checks something like a mirror freshness list

169
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,720
and says, hey, your mirror may be out of date,

170
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,300
would you like to try another mirror?

171
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,860
Yeah, like some sort of like-

172
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,500
Because vast majority of the time it's never a problem

173
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,300
and the mirrors are up to date and it's not an issue.

174
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,060
Yeah, but when it is a problem, it's a huge problem.

175
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,060
Like some sort of like apt update mirror or something

176
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,660
that would also ping mirrors and stuff like-

177
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,500
Well, there is.

178
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,060
There's a software sources thing on the Ubuntu desktop

179
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,940
where you press a button and it will choose

180
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,780
the farthest best mirror nearest to you

181
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,620
and all that kind of stuff.

182
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,460
That's very fair.

183
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,020
I just mean like sort of, just sort of like-

184
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,500
Or you could just choose the central mirror

185
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,620
and not use one local to you and choose the central one,

186
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,580
which is always up to date.

187
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,420
You could do that.

188
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,240
Yeah.

189
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,660
Yeah, it's one of the problems of having stuff

190
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,220
distributed all over the place.

191
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,340
This is Linux Unplugged episode 220

192
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,800
for October 24th, 2017.

193
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,800
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

194
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,480
that's Linux box is being held together with bubblegum,

195
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,560
a little bit of duct tape and some hope.

196
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,400
My name is Chris.

197
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,220
My name is Wes.

198
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,060
And Beard's here.

199
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:10,900
Hello, Beard.

200
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,880
Hey, I'm just over here taking out your sound server

201
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,720
with systemd.

202
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,480
Someone's gotta pre-chew all the gum.

203
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,040
That's helpful too.

204
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,480
That is very helpful.

205
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,240
Yeah, I'm kind of like scraping a system together

206
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,320
as we do this show.

207
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,720
I'm just trying to figure out what's going on

208
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,560
with the systemd.

209
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,040
I'm just trying to figure out what's going on

210
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,880
with the systemd.

211
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,160
I'm just trying to figure out what's going on

212
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,000
with the systemd.

213
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,280
I'm scraping a system together as we do this show.

214
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,480
Took us about 20 minutes to get the sound board working,

215
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,320
but we've got that.

216
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,560
So what else do we need other than a great lineup,

217
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,380
which we have today.

218
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:41,480
We have some news we'll get into, some community stuff,

219
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,200
couple of follow-up stories.

220
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,340
The Fedora Project has a post that they'd really like you

221
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,840
to read and we'll give you some highlights from that.

222
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,320
And then I've gone and created myself, not one,

223
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,120
but two remote desktop solutions.

224
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,460
I wanted to create myself a workstation in the cloud,

225
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,480
completely independent and isolated from anything else

226
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,480
that I could get access to anywhere in the world.

227
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,900
And then I wanted to create a separate remote desktop system

228
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,120
that was on the LAN of the studio.

229
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,900
That could get access to our huge recording files

230
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,900
that has a big fat GPU and a monster six core i7 CPU,

231
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,780
lots of local storage.

232
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:25,220
So one system up in the cloud with incredible bandwidth,

233
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,640
unlimited storage that I could pay for if I want to attach

234
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,320
and one system local with lots of GPU compute power,

235
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,120
both of them running Linux using X2GO.

236
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,520
And we've covered X2GO before on the network.

237
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,240
Noah did a great how-to on it ages ago

238
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,240
in Linux Action Show episode 374.

239
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,320
And this is my take on it.

240
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,680
I'm gonna talk about it a little bit differently.

241
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,320
I'm using Ubuntu 17.10,

242
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,240
so we'll talk about using modern Linux distributions

243
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,040
to do this, how I'm doing it, what I'm using it for,

244
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,280
what some of the downsides are,

245
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,080
and how unbelievably easy it is to get set up

246
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,240
and how it can just really change the game.

247
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,840
And I'm using it even when I'm here on my LAN

248
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,320
and I'm connecting to systems over the LAN using this.

249
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,920
It's so, so great.

250
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,680
So I'll share my project with you

251
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,880
and give you a little demo of the entire thing too

252
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,920
later on in the show.

253
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,400
So stay tuned for all of that stuff.

254
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,920
But before we go any further,

255
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,040
we're gonna bring in our virtual log,

256
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,140
Time Appropriate Greetings Discord channel.

257
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,400
Hey, hey.

258
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,220
Hey, hey.

259
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,060
Hello.

260
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:28,900
Hello, guys.

261
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,760
Yeah, so episode 220.

262
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,360
We're trying out Discord for this week's episode.

263
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,000
And it's bumpy so far.

264
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,760
You know, we're just, we're giving it a go, though.

265
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,820
We're giving it a go.

266
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,660
And we got a good amount of people showing up,

267
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,480
so thank you, everybody, for helping us do that.

268
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,480
Helps really actually put it through its paces.

269
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,320
So let's start with some community news, Wes.

270
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,260
What do you say, sir?

271
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,340
What do you say? Please.

272
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,080
I noticed, by the way, before we go any further,

273
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,840
you're still running 17.10 on that monster.

274
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,680
I sure am.

275
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,600
You're stuck with it for the week, huh?

276
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,440
Yeah, it's been a lot of fun.

277
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,440
And Beard, your rig over there, still running 17.10.

278
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,600
So all three of us are stuck with it for the week.

279
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,880
How unusual.

280
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,080
Against my better judgment.

281
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,680
Yeah, yeah.

282
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,640
All right, so let's talk about the Librem 5,

283
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,400
which has been an ongoing story,

284
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,840
spiked almost every single week by some new development.

285
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,320
And it has come to a conclusion.

286
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,260
The fundraiser is over with 142% funds raised.

287
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,760
They raised $2.1 million.

288
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,200
But they're doing something interesting, too.

289
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,940
They're leaving the pre-orders open.

290
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,880
So if you still want a Librem 5,

291
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,480
you can pre-order one right now and still get it.

292
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,780
So while the fundraiser's over,

293
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,320
they'll still take orders for it.

294
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,080
Librem 5, it's funded.

295
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,000
Now, as we've said before, the hard work begins.

296
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,160
But they've just recently announced a deal with,

297
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,340
or I guess a partnership with Nextcloud.

298
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,040
So they're gonna ship Nextcloud's apps by default

299
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,360
on the PureOS devices and on the Librem.

300
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,280
They've obviously, they've talked with the

301
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,400
plasma mobile folks, the GNOME desktop people, the Matrix.

302
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,920
They've been creating this network of partnerships

303
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,520
with the big names in open source right now.

304
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,340
Not the only, but big names in open source right now.

305
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,880
Nextcloud is a bit of an open source celebrity project.

306
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,840
Matrix, again, a bit of an open source celebrity project.

307
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,880
GNOME and Plasma, obviously huge heavyweights

308
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,580
with large fan bases.

309
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,000
And they're all kinda coming together

310
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,600
on this Librem 5 thing.

311
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,000
Why is this the first time we're seeing this?

312
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,360
Why didn't we see this earlier?

313
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,360
I guess the time's just kinda right.

314
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,920
Yeah, all the projects are in the right position.

315
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,840
Yeah, and good enough places have had enough polished,

316
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,360
let's say, releases where they feel like

317
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,560
these kinds of things are things

318
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,240
they can dedicate energy to.

319
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,080
I don't know.

320
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,160
Anyways, I am surprised, to be honest with you,

321
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,760
that they made it this far.

322
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,000
I thought the goal of 1.5 million was achievable,

323
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,800
but a long shot, and they surpassed it.

324
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,800
And however this fundraiser went,

325
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,480
now we actually see what the results

326
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,320
gonna be when they ship the hardware.

327
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,120
Yes, this'll be the really interesting part.

328
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,920
Okay, well, wow, congratulations to them.

329
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm really surprised.

330
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,360
I've also seen rumors coming out of them

331
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,720
that they're gonna be shipping tablets.

332
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,520
They wanna work on a NAS.

333
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,040
And of course, they've also recently announced

334
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,640
that they've disabled the Intel Management Engine stuff,

335
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,320
which we talked about on Linux Action News,

336
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,680
if you'd like to check that out.

337
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,320
But yeah, anybody in the Discord room?

338
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,160
Oh, that's weird.

339
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,800
Anybody there in the Mumble Discord thing?

340
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,520
Have a take on the Librem 5 funding,

341
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,360
or maybe a hope or a dream or a wish?

342
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,280
Wish upon a star for a Librem 5?

343
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,240
Oh, go ahead, JJ.

344
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,200
I saw you light up.

345
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,560
I don't hear you though.

346
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,560
It's all right.

347
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,840
JJ, you're excused.

348
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,160
I don't know that I'm ready to buy one,

349
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,600
but I would like to have friends and acquaintances

350
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,800
who have them, and you get to see them in real life.

351
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,880
That would be exciting for me.

352
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,560
Yeah, they're starting to tempt me,

353
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,480
but I think I'm not particularly motivated

354
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,800
to be an early adopter on my phone anymore.

355
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,840
Maybe if I didn't own a business and have kids.

356
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,880
Or if carrying two phones was a thing

357
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,360
that someone could do realistically.

358
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,000
But I would be willing to do it

359
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,560
if I started to see this thing ship

360
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,560
and it looked like it was a viable,

361
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,760
if even in an early stage, but a viable product.

362
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,760
I'd be willing to carry two phones for a while

363
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,440
as I sort of tried this thing out,

364
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,600
and then eventually switch over.

365
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,800
I could do that.

366
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,680
So I could be willing to get in that position eventually.

367
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,920
The competition is tough these days though.

368
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,520
I wonder if there's any angle to,

369
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,360
like their focus on freedom and security,

370
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,520
if there's any angle towards journalists

371
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,680
or other people who are really conscious

372
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,600
and really need to know what's going on with their phone.

373
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,240
Maybe you don't use it when you're at home in the States,

374
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,920
but you're traveling to Russia to do a story

375
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,280
and you want something that you have more control over.

376
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,400
And it really gives people in the open source community

377
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,360
who have held really, really steady to this principle

378
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,080
of I'm not going to use a mobile phone

379
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:02,080
because it violates either my privacy or my freedoms

380
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,520
or my personal views of technology.

381
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,920
There's a lot of reasons why people have just chosen

382
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,520
I'm not going to get a smartphone.

383
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,160
And maybe this would be a phone

384
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,160
that might appeal to some of them.

385
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,000
It's not a huge market.

386
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,060
It's not going to make a company millions of dollars,

387
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,560
but there may be a loyal customer base there

388
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,240
if you can make a product that actually serves them.

389
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,100
We'll wait and see.

390
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,400
It's still a lot of this stuff up in the air,

391
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,280
but I could see it.

392
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,120
I could see it.

393
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,960
I could see it.

394
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,920
And now that they made their funding,

395
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,880
I'm hoping they'll be able to ship a few.

396
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,160
Let's talk a little bit about Fedora

397
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,520
because we've been talking a lot about Ubuntu

398
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,440
and we still are going to talk about Ubuntu a bit more today.

399
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,160
We have some news, too.

400
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,200
But I thought, well, then we should take a moment

401
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,320
to talk about Fedora just to make sure we talk

402
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,000
about some hard work that's happening over there.

403
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,760
They felt that way, too.

404
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,880
They took to their blog over there.

405
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,440
This is Christian who he blogs quite a bit

406
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,360
about the development of GNOME.

407
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,240
And he took to his blog right around the release of Ubuntu

408
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,360
in 1710 and said, well, let's take a look

409
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,720
at where Fedora's coming from and where it's going.

410
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,760
And so he says, while we're putting the touches

411
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,520
on the final finishing touches on Fedora 27,

412
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,600
I'll try to look back at everything we've achieved

413
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,280
since Fedora Workstation was launched with Fedora 21.

414
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,200
So we're going back to about Fedora 21.

415
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,080
This blog is about taking stock and taking some pride

416
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,800
in what we've achieved so far and major hurdles

417
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,840
that we've passed along our way

418
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,600
to improve the Linux desktop experience.

419
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,520
First one on this list, Wayland.

420
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,600
We've been the biggest contributor

421
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,760
since we joined the effort, he says.

422
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,320
But lib input is another area

423
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,640
we think we've made a big difference.

424
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,840
GLVND, which deals with multiple OpenGL devices.

425
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,760
Porting Firefox GTK3, Google Drive integration.

426
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,520
Flatpak gets a mention.

427
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,960
Could come back to that in a minute.

428
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,640
The Linux firmware service, GNOME software,

429
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,560
MP3 and AC3 support and AAC support landing in Fedora.

430
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,000
And a few other things like working

431
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,160
with some improved touch support,

432
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,720
Nautilus improvements, the nightlight mode in GNOME

433
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,840
that makes it a little easier on the eyes after the sun sets.

434
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,600
And some other GNOME shell improvements.

435
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,040
And of course, one of my favorites,

436
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,720
GNOME Builder and PipeWire have been projects

437
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,880
they've worked on, including other ones

438
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,360
that are important specifically to Fedora,

439
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,560
like Fleet Commander and a few other things.

440
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,720
It's actually a pretty impressive list.

441
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,640
I have the entire thing linked in the show notes.

442
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,720
And I thought, you know what, it is fair.

443
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,760
It is fair to take a moment and say,

444
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,320
Ubuntu 17.10 was a really great release.

445
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,840
And it's because they're able to stand on the shoulders

446
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,960
of what the GNOME 3 community has been building now

447
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,480
for years and years and years.

448
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,640
If 17.10 had launched when GNOME 3 was new,

449
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,840
and they were shipping GNOME 3 years and years ago,

450
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,640
it would have been a train wreck of a release.

451
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,680
Oh yeah, definitely.

452
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,000
So yeah, I thought, okay, fair enough.

453
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,440
At first I was giving them a hard time

454
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,560
for kind of doing a me too post

455
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,440
right around Ubuntu 17.10's release.

456
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,040
I was like, oh, come on Fedora.

457
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,680
It's okay, we haven't forgotten about you guys.

458
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,880
But then I read that list and I'm like,

459
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,800
damn, that is a list, that is a really great list.

460
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,440
Like the Linux Vendor Firmware Project,

461
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,280
you know that's a personal favorite of mine.

462
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,200
LibInput has made a huge improvement

463
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,360
for using trackpads under GNU slash Linux.

464
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,500
And of course, it's really important for going to Wayland.

465
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,480
Yeah, the list really cements the feeling I have like,

466
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,480
well, I may not use Fedora desktop

467
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,720
on a lot of workstations I actually have.

468
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,760
They just do a lot of really important backend work

469
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,280
that you don't necessarily appreciate.

470
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,080
Circling back to Flatpak, I've been trying to take stock.

471
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,520
You know, Flatpak's had a couple of delays in Fedora

472
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,080
for where they wanted to be at right now.

473
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,400
So I'm like, where's the adoptions?

474
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,800
We've had a lot of conversations about Snap,

475
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,600
a lot of people talking about Snaps.

476
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,920
So what metric do you measure success, right?

477
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,960
Well, I have a metric that perhaps we could use.

478
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,280
The piracy metric, porn and piracy, what are they using?

479
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,040
Which Universal Linux packaging format

480
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,280
are the pirates using?

481
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,760
And it appears to be so far, Flatpak.

482
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,600
Hey, yo.

483
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,680
Yeah, pirates are now packaging Windows games with Flatpak

484
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,160
because they can bundle like a little wine

485
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,560
or DOSBox runtime in there.

486
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,200
Like they've got like this whole way

487
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,840
to distribute Windows games on Linux now using Flatpaks.

488
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,040
So here's your use.

489
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,360
Open source for the win.

490
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,480
And on the Waraz site,

491
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,440
because you know, on these platforms

492
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,920
where all your stuff is commercial

493
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,120
and you got to pay for everything,

494
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,800
this is like something that's like a huge market,

495
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,120
like stealing software.

496
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,320
Like the open source community,

497
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,440
we don't even have to worry about this.

498
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,400
It's just in our repos, but here, you know,

499
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,600
they have to describe what you're getting.

500
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,120
So they say Flatpak is a new package management system

501
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,960
built for simple universal single click installations,

502
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,960
games that just work neatly stuffed in a locked sandbox.

503
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,720
It's perfect for them.

504
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,560
So there you go.

505
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,880
Flatpak, the choice of Windows software pirates

506
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,960
for games on Linux around the world.

507
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,920
If that's not a niche market, I don't know what is.

508
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,960
Year of the pirate Linux desktop?

509
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,800
I'm not sure.

510
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,640
I mean, if you think about it though, you know,

511
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,880
you download a Flatpak

512
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,320
and you just have a full wine setup all done for you.

513
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,320
Right, I know.

514
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,600
It could be the choice for Linux pirates.

515
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,640
It's kind of like what,

516
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,320
it's kind of like a shades of what Ikey's working on

517
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,520
with the Linux Steam integration project,

518
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,960
but for just one specific game.

519
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,640
So when are actual game developers

520
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,280
gonna start releasing games in Flatpak?

521
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,560
Right, right, or, you know, it seems like app images

522
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,480
would make a lot of sense for game developers.

523
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,640
And I could see snaps too,

524
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,840
especially if you wanna make it easy on people.

525
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,960
But what about the maintainers?

526
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,160
What about the distro maintainers?

527
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,600
Let's talk about maintainers for a moment.

528
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,680
Wes found this really interesting piece

529
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,600
over on snowyman.com, manipulating maintainers.

530
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,720
And he says the alternative title really could be

531
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,080
how to get members of any open source community

532
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,240
to be interested in helping you,

533
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,160
but manipulating maintainers is a catchier title.

534
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,000
It sure is.

535
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,640
And he makes a core point right here

536
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,000
at the beginning of the piece

537
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,440
that really smacked me in the face.

538
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,040
And it's, God, is this not true?

539
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,080
It's so true in Linux podcasting,

540
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,880
quote unquote, Linux media space too.

541
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,360
He says there's an old ha ha, only but serious joke.

542
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,120
If you go to a Linux forum

543
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,080
and you ask for help fixing your wifi driver,

544
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,440
everyone will ignore you.

545
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,320
If you instead say, Linux sucks,

546
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,280
you can't even get wifi to work,

547
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,680
then thousands of people

548
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,800
will try to solve the problem for you.

549
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,320
So if you just say Linux sucks, it can't get wifi,

550
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,560
all of a sudden everybody wants to help.

551
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,840
But if you say, I need help with wifi, nobody helps.

552
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,080
This story is a great example of manipulating people,

553
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,880
but it's obviously a negative take on it.

554
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,800
I'd like to share some thoughts on this

555
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,880
from a much more positive standpoint,

556
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,920
which will help you get people to pay more attention,

557
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,080
be more helpful, and perhaps most importantly,

558
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,080
create a healthier open source community overall.

559
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,560
And he touches on core points

560
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,440
to getting involved with open source communities,

561
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,080
like don't waste people's time,

562
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,040
demonstrate that you've actually

563
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,480
tried to solve your problem.

564
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,480
That's a huge one, yeah.

565
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,480
Help other people, don't be rude,

566
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,760
and he gives examples of what might come across rude

567
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,480
and what you could maybe say instead.

568
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,680
And I know some of this sounds like basic stuff,

569
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,680
but it's a good read, it's insightful.

570
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,560
Say thank you, admit if you're new,

571
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,000
offer to help, and maybe consider giving money.

572
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,640
It's not a universal, and to be clear,

573
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,160
don't necessarily think they're asking for it,

574
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,600
but sometimes people just need a little cash

575
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,120
to help make something a priority.

576
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,320
I think that example at the top really just shows

577
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,920
that here we're talking about motivations.

578
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,960
I know for me, all right, so you respond in anger,

579
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,360
someone's dissing your favorite OS,

580
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,320
and you're like, well, I'm gonna show them,

581
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,680
yeah, it's super easy.

582
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,080
You're just responding, and it's not the interaction

583
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,840
any of us want, and it's not really the solution here,

584
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,720
but you're not thinking about,

585
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,360
I know I've certainly seen requests for help,

586
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,600
and when they're vague, you're like, well, I just don't.

587
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,240
You imagine all the work you're gonna be in here

588
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,520
trying to understand this person's problem and identifying,

589
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,800
and then once you've started helping,

590
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,360
you feel this obligation to continue helping.

591
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,240
That's not really so when you're just responding like,

592
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,240
yeah, of course Wi-Fi works, try this, right?

593
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,680
And so all of these tips help show

594
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,680
and make it more reasonable.

595
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,760
So if someone has a very specific problem,

596
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,200
you're like, oh, okay, I wanna figure out what's going on too.

597
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,040
I don't have to wade through the 10 steps

598
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,000
of introductory debugging that this person may

599
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,960
or may not have done.

600
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,880
So if you can get any of those barriers lower,

601
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,160
you have a much better time.

602
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:03,240
Yeah, I think it's a lot about how you approach it too.

603
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,720
If you come into it with sort of a, more of a, not humble,

604
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,120
because that makes it sound like you have to tiptoe around,

605
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,120
but if you come at it with,

606
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,440
maybe I don't have the full context

607
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,120
when you ask your question,

608
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,920
and then realize that sometimes those strong reactions too

609
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,000
are because you're not asking the right question,

610
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,280
and so people respond negatively.

611
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,760
And so sometimes you have to come in with the understanding

612
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,840
maybe I'm getting this response

613
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,560
because I've asked something outside the context

614
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,120
of where I'm supposed to ask it or something.

615
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:32,960
What about you, Beard?

616
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,160
You are involved in God knows how many IRC communities,

617
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,920
Discord chat rooms.

618
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,960
You must see people stumble into the rooms

619
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,840
and communities you hang out in all the time

620
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,640
and just blow it from time to time.

621
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,520
Yeah, I mean, basically just be nice

622
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,000
and don't act like you know everything,

623
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,480
and you'll pretty much get all the help you need.

624
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,120
Yeah, that's even true when you think

625
00:22:59,120 --> 00:22:59,960
you're an expert on something.

626
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,120
I had a moment one time

627
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,360
where I was troubleshooting a network problem.

628
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,000
Table unplugged, yeah, I know.

629
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,600
It was close.

630
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,280
It was really close.

631
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:14,360
It was like a loop because I had a hub loop.

632
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,680
I had some sort of network loop.

633
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,040
Oh, yeah.

634
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,360
But I thought it was an ISP problem.

635
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,520
And so I'm talking to the tech,

636
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,280
and I'm like 45 minutes into it,

637
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,560
and I'm generally a very nice person on the phone,

638
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:29,040
maybe too nice, but I got a show I gotta do.

639
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,720
45 minutes into it, I start going, look, man.

640
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,000
All right, I've done the router reboot thing.

641
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,080
I've done all the little troubleshooting things you want.

642
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,440
Here's what, I can ping this.

643
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,280
I can traceroute this.

644
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,440
I'm just giving them all this information.

645
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,360
I've fixed networks for a living.

646
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,280
Can we just skip all this stupid bullshit

647
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,040
and just work on getting a trouble ticket established

648
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,680
for a connection issue?

649
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,520
And the guy's like, well,

650
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,240
could you just do me one more favor?

651
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,040
Could you go down and just check to see

652
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,720
if you have any hubs plugged into each other

653
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,080
or anything weird that could be causing

654
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,800
some sort of network loop?

655
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,800
Fine, I think to myself.

656
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,680
And I go down, and I check the switch.

657
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,840
It's fine, everything's fine.

658
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,360
I'm like, idiot, this guy's such an idiot.

659
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,600
And I'm huffing and puffing my way back up to the stairs

660
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,960
where I left the phone, and it crosses my mind.

661
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,080
Hey, dumbass, you have a little hub out

662
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:17,160
where your NAS and your Wi-Fi access point is in the garage.

663
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,000
That could be where your problem's at, smart guy.

664
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,240
And I go, oh, crap.

665
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,120
I walk back down the stairs, out into the garage,

666
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,040
and sure enough, I had a network loop,

667
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,600
and I had to go pick up the phone and be like,

668
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,080
okay, I'm sorry, yep, that did resolve the problem.

669
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,280
Thank you for your time.

670
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,160
Just stuffed this whole crow right down the gullet.

671
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,080
That's why I heard that, goddammit, Noah.

672
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,480
Yeah, yes, actually, that did happen, didn't it?

673
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,000
That was actually a separate time.

674
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,960
From that lesson I learned that's usually just Noah's fault

675
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,320
is actually what I learned from that.

676
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,600
Yeah, all right, well, that was good.

677
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,200
If anybody in the, oh, I see, Bashful,

678
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,120
you had something you wanted to jump in with.

679
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,520
I'd love to hear, go ahead.

680
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,760
That was more so earlier when you were talking

681
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,360
about the communities and stuff.

682
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,200
No, go ahead.

683
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,440
For example, Rika, I was saying just ask, be nice,

684
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,280
all that kind of stuff,

685
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,680
but it's also the sense of entitlement

686
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,280
that you have to, things like have an answer immediately

687
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,240
or that people are gonna be online 24 by seven

688
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,560
or so on and so forth.

689
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,800
They just expect you to be there nonstop.

690
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,160
Right, yeah, so that's the hard thing.

691
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,120
So the entitlement thing is hard

692
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,960
because nobody wants to be told

693
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,840
that they have a sense of entitlement.

694
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,160
Nobody wants to hear that.

695
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,280
So that's a real off-putting thing.

696
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,000
And then the second problem is nobody realizes

697
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,840
they have a self-entitlement problem

698
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,320
because they just are coming in like their time of day.

699
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,440
So they're up, and you sometimes don't stop and go,

700
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,000
well, these people might be on the other end of the world.

701
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,080
They might be asleep right now.

702
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,640
Yeah, that's actually one of the things you see

703
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,280
the most often in support channels

704
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,680
is you see somebody come in, ask a question, and leave.

705
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,560
Or come in, ask a question,

706
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,560
complain that nobody's talking, and leave.

707
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,000
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

708
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,840
And if they would just idle for a bit.

709
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,200
And it's all within like two minutes.

710
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,920
Yeah, idle for a day.

711
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,520
Yeah, it's just more of a perception thing

712
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,760
on both sides of the fence.

713
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,920
Like I don't mean it in sort of the point of view

714
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,280
that people can't expect an answer or should or shouldn't.

715
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,880
It's just more so both sides of the fence

716
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,040
need to be conscious of the fact

717
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,760
that there are things like time zones, availability,

718
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,720
families, all that other kind of stuff.

719
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,440
Yeah, good points.

720
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,160
Okay, so I would say we could make a little room

721
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,800
in next week's episode if anybody in the audience

722
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,200
has a couple that they feel like we've left out,

723
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,240
especially anybody involved in some open source communities

724
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,960
where there's something specifically on your list

725
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,160
that people do. Yeah, definitely.

726
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,040
You know, your shit list.

727
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,400
Let us know, leave a comment,

728
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,840
or go to the subreddit, linuxunpluggedatreddit.com,

729
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,960
and leave it on this week's episode.

730
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,080
And if we get a couple of good ones,

731
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,640
I'll carve out some time in next week's episode

732
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,040
to try to include those because I think it's kind of

733
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,920
particularly important for an open source community

734
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,360
when a lot of people are constantly coming in

735
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,040
that have never interacted with different communities,

736
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,040
and it's different cultures,

737
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:56,000
and different people use online platforms differently,

738
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,880
and people email me all the time

739
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,880
thinking I'm gonna respond maybe that day,

740
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,440
or maybe within a few days,

741
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,800
and sometimes it's like four or five months

742
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,400
before you get a response from me.

743
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,120
And I don't mean for it to be like that,

744
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,720
but that's just what happens sometimes,

745
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,360
and it's a stressful thing for me to go in my inbox

746
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,600
because I know I have a bunch of old emails

747
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,240
where people expected me to respond faster

748
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,280
because that's how they do email.

749
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,800
And that's the same thing.

750
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,680
You just have to understand that people

751
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,520
have different expectations for these systems.

752
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,400
Especially in the open source world.

753
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,920
All right, well before we move on,

754
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,320
let's mention Ting for just a moment.

755
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,040
My mobile service provider, oh, it's Ting.

756
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,560
You go over to linux.ting.com.

757
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,600
That'll give you $25 off a Ting device,

758
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,200
or maybe even better because if you can bring a Ting device,

759
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,920
they'll give you $25 in credit,

760
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,720
which will probably pay for more than your first month.

761
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,440
It's pay for what you use wireless.

762
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,120
It's really great because take Beardsley here.

763
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,360
He's mine?

764
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,600
Hey, you know, Chris, I actually have a new Ting Sim.

765
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,400
Ting-sponsored TwitchCon.

766
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,240
Oh, really?

767
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,560
So you just got an extra ready-to-go Sim,

768
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,600
like a standby Sim?

769
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,880
Just sitting in my room.

770
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,440
Yeah, that's nice.

771
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,560
But you know, for Beardsley, it's a great example.

772
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:15,560
So JB has a Ting account with like three lines on there,

773
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,960
I think, maybe even four lines,

774
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,360
and one of the lines we give to Beards,

775
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,800
so that way he has a phone where we can get a hold of him,

776
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,320
and he has a little device that he can use

777
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,000
to take over the world.

778
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,280
And most of the time, Beardsley's somewhere

779
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,440
that has Wi-Fi, almost all the time.

780
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,440
But he traveled to TwitchCon,

781
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,040
and during that time,

782
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,160
it'll be like a little more for service.

783
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,240
But if you take the fact that maybe this month,

784
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,880
we're gonna pay $15 more, maybe at most,

785
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,040
for his usage,

786
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,280
but you average that out over the fact

787
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,040
that we almost pay for nothing most of the time

788
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,160
when he's on Wi-Fi, it's a great deal.

789
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,480
There is definitely a data spike.

790
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,960
Yeah, and I know of at least one phone call,

791
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,800
because I got one.

792
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,040
Oh, but it's perfect for that kind of setup.

793
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:57,880
It's great for me too,

794
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,560
because with a little bit of planning,

795
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,520
I can preload my podcast for the day,

796
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,760
I can pin the music to my device,

797
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,040
and when I'm driving, I can basically use no data,

798
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,360
and then when I get to work, I can use Wi-Fi.

799
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,000
Man, it's so great, because it's nationwide.

800
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,600
When I travel, I use it the entire time.

801
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,360
They have CDMA and GSM.

802
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,920
There's no contracts, there's no other termination fees.

803
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,000
So if Beard wants to throw that SIM card

804
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,360
in a tablet for a couple of months,

805
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,080
and then decides, I'm not really ever using it,

806
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,440
there's no penalty to just turn it off.

807
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,120
You go into their dashboard, it's simple,

808
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,000
and you can control it there.

809
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,960
You can also monitor all your usage.

810
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,280
They have so many different devices

811
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,920
you can pick from or bring your own.

812
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,720
Like I mentioned, they have a CDMA and a GSM network,

813
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,720
so there's tons of options there.

814
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,240
Check out their blog too.

815
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,480
They have a blog right now about earning some side cash.

816
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,880
It's a little bit of extra money, whoa,

817
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,400
off of Google opinion rewards.

818
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,080
So check that out too on the Ting blog.

819
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,560
Start by going to linux.ting.com,

820
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:57,560
support the show, and sign up over at ting, linux.ting.com.

821
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,480
Let's get into the Ubuntu corner.

822
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,200
So we have some Ubuntu news to get to.

823
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,000
Yeah, as you would expect after a big major release.

824
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,400
And ever since the announcement

825
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,400
that they would be switching to the GNOME desktop,

826
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,120
discontinuing active development on Unity,

827
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,120
and restructure the company a bit,

828
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,240
all of us armchair analysts like myself specifically,

829
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,440
I'll just talk about me,

830
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,280
all said, ah, ha, ha, ha, here we go.

831
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,520
Mark Shuttleworth is refactoring the company,

832
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,080
getting it ready perhaps for some funding here and there,

833
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:33,240
and eventually to go public, do an IPO.

834
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,480
And it seems that is exactly the case.

835
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,240
He was interviewed over at eWeek.com.

836
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,760
We've got a link in the show notes by Sean.

837
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,360
And some interesting things were revealed by Mark.

838
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,760
He said that as long as we stay a private company,

839
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,280
we have complete discretion as to whether we,

840
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,400
maybe I should read this in like a more epic voice for Mark,

841
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,440
even though it doesn't sound like,

842
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,040
as long as we stay purely a private company,

843
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,360
we have complete discretion

844
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,840
as to whether we carry things

845
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,680
that are not commercially sustainable, Shuttleworth said.

846
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,880
Now what he's really saying there

847
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,280
is when we're a private company,

848
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,840
we can dump money into projects

849
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,960
that don't make us any money.

850
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,520
JB has that luxury,

851
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,480
a luxury which we may sometimes maybe abuse.

852
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,280
And as perhaps Canonical was potentially abusing,

853
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,120
because if you look at it from a perspective

854
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,840
of maybe a company that needs to make money

855
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,960
or a company that wants to go public, then things change.

856
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,880
You can't necessarily really justify that.

857
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,280
And then Mark goes on to say,

858
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,600
what you'll see at some stage soon

859
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,720
is that we have broken even on all the pieces

860
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,280
that we do commercially without Unity,

861
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,880
as in Ubuntu makes money,

862
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,080
the server stuff makes, the cloud stuff makes money,

863
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,880
the consulting stuff is making money,

864
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,280
the OEM deals are making money.

865
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,680
They're becoming self-sustainable.

866
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,400
If you go outside the Unity projects,

867
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,680
Unity 8, stuff like that.

868
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,320
At some stage after that,

869
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,320
we will take a round of investment,

870
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,760
which will be a growth round

871
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,640
that will be aimed at helping us become a public company

872
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,160
in due course.

873
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,000
So there you go.

874
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,280
Yeah, all right.

875
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,040
And- Big stuff in the works.

876
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,520
Yeah, that's what it means, basically.

877
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,560
There's nothing too shocking,

878
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,400
nothing too majorly revealed there.

879
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,640
It's all kind of what we speculated,

880
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,040
but the speculation in this case was correct.

881
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,840
And I think it's gonna result

882
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,320
in a lean, mean, canonical machine, actually.

883
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,160
Like, no hard feelings.

884
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,000
They tried it.

885
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,960
They did the whole, the phone thing.

886
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,760
They played with Unity and Mir and Go in their own way

887
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,600
and innovating on the Linux desktop.

888
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,160
Turns out that's not really what the market wants

889
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,320
or how things are gonna go.

890
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,800
And so, yeah, there's a smart pivot

891
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,280
back to what their core is.

892
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,720
He mentioned shutting down Unity

893
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,040
being one of the toughest things he's ever had to do.

894
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:36,880
I bet.

895
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,720
I'm sure, right?

896
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,680
I mean, there's obviously a ton of people there,

897
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,640
engineers, developers, designers,

898
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,200
everyone pouring their heart into it.

899
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,800
So that's hard.

900
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,200
And he went out specifically on a limb himself

901
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,600
to try to say, let's do this as the future.

902
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,440
And then nobody bit.

903
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,640
And then he's like, oh God, now I gotta own up to that.

904
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,640
And he did it.

905
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,120
JJ, you had something you wanted to say.

906
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:54,960
Go ahead.

907
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,360
We've had bad luck

908
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,760
with people being muted or something today.

909
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,840
There's a scoreboard.

910
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,480
I don't know if it's Discord or.

911
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,800
I think it might just be JJ.

912
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,640
Yeah.

913
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,480
Yeah.

914
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,320
Oh.

915
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,040
What do you got?

916
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,360
You got some sort of switch flipped over there, JJ.

917
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,960
You got like some sort of like NSA privacy screen up.

918
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,080
What's going on up there?

919
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,200
Must be using FreeBSD.

920
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,040
There is a.

921
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,400
I think he's using the lead one five, that's.

922
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,040
There is a video interview of Mark over on the E-Week website

923
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,960
if you want to see that.

924
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,960
The beautiful thing about Ubuntu is

925
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,000
we created the possibility of a platform

926
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,280
that's free of charge to its end users

927
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,440
with commercial services in mind.

928
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,160
In the sort of dream that might define the future

929
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,920
in all sorts of different ways.

930
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:43,400
And we really have seen that Ubuntu has moved

931
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,320
into the mainstream in a bunch of areas.

932
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,560
You know, you think about it

933
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,560
and you watch the full video on their site.

934
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,080
It's really good timing still for them

935
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,040
because the desktop thing is sort of sorting itself out.

936
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,000
Wes and I were just having the conversation earlier

937
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,720
that desktop Linux in a lot of ways

938
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,080
has gotten really, really, really good recently.

939
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,760
Like we just read that list from the Fedora project.

940
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,000
That's a solid list of really good stuff.

941
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,040
Ubuntu 17.10, all three of us are still using it

942
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,320
after that review.

943
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,200
We're like, we're actually still working pretty good for me.

944
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,640
And I've put it on even more systems.

945
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:19,320
And that was without, like I've hardly configured a thing.

946
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,440
And we have some good stuff like PipeWire in the work soon

947
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,200
that's gonna solve some really longstanding issues

948
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,040
that I've had.

949
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,200
You might even be able to get audio

950
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,320
on the machine you use for the show.

951
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,160
I don't know.

952
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,480
That's the pipe dream.

953
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,080
And so like that problem is sort of solving itself

954
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,880
because you then have OEMs that are then taking

955
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,800
that product that's getting pretty good.

956
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,320
And then they're doing the marketing,

957
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,640
targeting at developers and the niche market.

958
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,200
Yeah, they're doing the polishing

959
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,720
and you have same system 76 trying to do the same thing

960
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,000
to a greater extent with Pop!OS.

961
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,400
And then they can focus on the cloud and IoT

962
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,640
where there is a ton of traction to be gained.

963
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,280
And they have a pretty good in-road already.

964
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,880
So it does seem like they have a pretty good chance

965
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,520
of making this thing a money-making machine.

966
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:07,520
I gotta say it takes some big cojones to cut your losses

967
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,080
rather than doubling down again.

968
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,360
Mm-hmm, yeah.

969
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,280
Chris. Yes, sir.

970
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:19,280
I don't wanna reveal anything that's a company confidential

971
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:24,560
but back in April when Mark announced the end of life

972
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,960
of some of these projects

973
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,680
and it was clearly a difficult thing for him to do

974
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,820
with letting go a bunch of people in the canonical family.

975
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:40,880
I found it interesting that I saw a different side of Mark

976
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,800
very keen on the welfare of the people

977
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,560
who were leaving the company.

978
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,560
He knew that he couldn't continue to fund these things,

979
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:55,560
that it wasn't possible for us to continue developing

980
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,600
all these different projects

981
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,680
that were super interesting and cool and fun

982
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,420
but at the end of the day,

983
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,080
they wouldn't make money in the real world.

984
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:11,080
And I think he felt really terrible

985
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,820
having to let those people go.

986
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:17,500
And I think some people see Mark

987
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,740
as a very hard-headed businessman.

988
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:23,740
And when you look at how much he's financed,

989
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:26,520
not just Ubuntu but he's used a lot of his money

990
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,800
for other things as well, philanthropic stuff

991
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,060
but also other open source projects.

992
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,460
He's used some of that money

993
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:37,680
to fund some other distributions, not just Ubuntu.

994
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,300
I think it's interesting to see this news come out now

995
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:47,300
that actually it's a little sad for him

996
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,220
that things didn't work out.

997
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:54,900
Yeah, well, who in their right mind

998
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,940
creates something like a project like this?

999
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:00,020
I mean, nobody gets into this stuff

1000
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:03,960
to have to make these really, really awfully hard

1001
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,900
sucky business decisions that only business owners

1002
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,820
or people in that position end up having to make,

1003
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,420
people in that top role.

1004
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:14,380
And it's gotta be hard to see.

1005
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:17,740
These are real people who've been brought

1006
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,580
into the whole Ubuntu ecosystem.

1007
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:23,420
A lot of the people who work for Canonical then and now

1008
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:26,100
are ex-community people who were hired in

1009
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,260
because they were active in the community

1010
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,820
and they wanted to do cool things with Ubuntu.

1011
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,580
And there was this guy who came along

1012
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:37,380
and enabled them to sit at home in their office

1013
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,220
and work on stuff that's super cool.

1014
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,380
And there aren't many opportunities you get in your life

1015
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:46,380
to sit at home and work on something super cool with friends.

1016
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,620
And he enabled that.

1017
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:51,540
And I think it's a little sad.

1018
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:56,540
And this recent interview coming out is difficult

1019
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:00,620
for those of us looking back on the difficult times

1020
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,860
back in April.

1021
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:04,980
But equally, we've got a positive thing to look forward to,

1022
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,500
which is the company is streamlined

1023
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,680
and we're not spreading ourselves super thin

1024
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,960
across a large number of projects that we used to.

1025
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,780
I mean, I think a common criticism that I used to have

1026
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:19,860
is they have too many projects, they're too distracted,

1027
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,940
there's no chance they're gonna get into mobile.

1028
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:27,940
And those were just common, those were criticisms

1029
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,820
I might lob, but they were just common ones

1030
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,660
that would be parroted.

1031
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,900
Yeah, everyone said that.

1032
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,700
Yeah, and I don't know, who's saying that now?

1033
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,740
Because none of those things are true anymore.

1034
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,820
Like the focus seems to make a lot of sense.

1035
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,100
The end results are pretty impressive so far.

1036
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:46,180
And we're not even privy to all of the ongoing back end

1037
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:49,060
business deals that are profitable to Canonical

1038
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,220
that are also a result of this work.

1039
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:54,140
But they are happening and they are-

1040
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,500
It was interesting to see Mark point out

1041
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,420
that there are areas of the business that are profitable,

1042
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,900
obviously as a privately held company,

1043
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,860
he doesn't have to reveal details about how profitable

1044
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,380
each part of the company is.

1045
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:08,700
But on the road to IPO, he's going to have to reveal

1046
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:12,340
some of this to potential investors in the future.

1047
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:15,540
But it was interesting to reveal that something

1048
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,500
a lot of us internally have known for a while,

1049
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,980
that this is more profitable than people think.

1050
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:23,460
Well, Canonical has, from my experience,

1051
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:26,020
and this is something that was very apparent

1052
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:29,780
just at the rally too, is they have a unique combo going

1053
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,740
in that they're making the software,

1054
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:34,580
they're selling the support, and the Ubuntu brand

1055
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,900
is carrying quite a bit of weight in enterprise now.

1056
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,580
And so a lot of big companies that are scaling out

1057
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:44,420
very, very fast, you could think of large media companies

1058
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:47,940
online that you know of, or just large web companies

1059
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,540
that you know of that are scaling very fast,

1060
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,660
perhaps they're in a growth trajectory right now.

1061
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,900
And scaling out large data centers

1062
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,740
is a massive time commitment.

1063
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,500
They know that their system runs on Ubuntu,

1064
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,740
they know that they want Ubuntu-based data centers,

1065
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,780
but they want somebody who really knows their shit

1066
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,140
and somebody who will keep it up to date

1067
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,780
and running well and secure, because damn,

1068
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,700
isn't cyber security an issue now?

1069
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,340
And man, do we not want to have to be the ones responsible

1070
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,180
for managing that?

1071
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,620
Well, guess who we can call?

1072
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:15,060
We call Canonical, because they're making the thing.

1073
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,700
So now all of a sudden, Canonical's got a contract

1074
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,140
to build out a data center, load the software,

1075
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:22,340
and then maintain the software.

1076
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,060
And Canonical can either hand the keys over to them

1077
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,860
and say, here's your data center, or they can say,

1078
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,340
actually, you know what, funny thing,

1079
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,340
we don't feel like hiring 15 people,

1080
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:33,820
do you guys just wanna take care of that for us?

1081
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:36,700
And there are multiple ways for Canonical

1082
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,840
to make revenue by Ubuntu being free.

1083
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:43,000
And they all seem obvious, because they seem like ones

1084
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,700
that corporate America would just totally click with.

1085
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,780
Like that is an arrangement that would make sense

1086
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,580
to corporate IT people, especially people

1087
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,700
that are evaluating risk and time to get something spun up.

1088
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,880
It's a no-brainer for them,

1089
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,700
and that's gonna be an obvious moneymaker.

1090
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,980
And then we know that they have an OEM program

1091
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,660
with companies like Dell and HP,

1092
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:04,220
where there's some kind of arrangement

1093
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,060
where there's money made on machines that are sold

1094
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,140
that also is profitable.

1095
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:12,520
And so with that, we have now to look forward to 1804.

1096
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,600
And now we are almost out of the Ubuntu section,

1097
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,580
for those of you that are sick and tired

1098
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,040
of hearing about it.

1099
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,900
I know some of you couldn't care less.

1100
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,580
This is a great little title, though.

1101
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,540
I'm enjoying it immediately already.

1102
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,080
Yeah, I know, and we just got it, this is news.

1103
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,260
And it'll be like this probably

1104
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,740
for like maybe a half another episode,

1105
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:32,720
because we have in the works an interview

1106
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,680
with some friends from Canonical

1107
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,940
that worked really hard specifically on the 1710 release,

1108
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:42,020
and we're gonna hopefully get them in next week's episode,

1109
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:44,020
as well as a couple follow-up items.

1110
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:47,980
But we now have, before we get out of the Ubuntu corner,

1111
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,480
a name.

1112
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:53,800
Beavering Away at the Brilliantly Bionic 1804,

1113
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,340
Mark Shalloworth today posted on his blog

1114
00:41:56,340 --> 00:42:01,140
the name of 1804 Ubuntu, and it is the bionic beaver.

1115
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,320
The bionic beaver.

1116
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,100
There are so many B-words in this post.

1117
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:04,940
It's pretty good. It's incredible.

1118
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,340
Yeah, he has some fun.

1119
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,220
There's a line in here that maybe I could poke

1120
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,380
Popey's brain about that I feel like maybe

1121
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:14,420
I should know more about, and this was sort of news to me.

1122
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:16,640
He says in one of his paragraphs here

1123
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,820
that there's an IRC channel people can join

1124
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:23,900
to work with those who are updating Unity 7

1125
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:28,000
for the newest X and kernel graphics in 1804.

1126
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:34,140
So, is that a community project to keep Unity 7 going?

1127
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,820
So, I think there's a number of people

1128
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,340
who have come out of the woodwork saying,

1129
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,860
you know what, I actually quite like Unity 7,

1130
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,780
and I would like it to carry on working the way I like it.

1131
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:47,940
Now, I appreciate it's like Marmite.

1132
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,860
Like, not everyone likes Unity.

1133
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:50,700
Of course.

1134
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,620
There are people like i3 or Gnome Shell

1135
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:54,460
or whatever else takes place.

1136
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:56,840
Marte, Asma, XFCE.

1137
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,260
Yeah, exactly.

1138
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:01,340
But, turns out we shipped a bunch of machines

1139
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:04,300
through hardware vendors that had Unity by default,

1140
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,380
and a lot of people actually quite like that.

1141
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:10,300
And we have noticed a lot of community people

1142
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,620
who've rallied around and said,

1143
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:13,740
we'd like to help keep that going.

1144
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:16,580
Now, it's great to have community people

1145
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:17,900
who are interested in keeping that going,

1146
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,860
but what we really need is developers

1147
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:23,140
because we need people to be able to review patches

1148
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:25,940
and understand bug reports, triage them,

1149
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,500
all the kind of usual stuff you do

1150
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,260
in the development cycle of a desktop.

1151
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,700
And we would love to keep Unity 7

1152
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,780
well alive through 18.04 and beyond.

1153
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,600
It will be pretty much in maintenance mode.

1154
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,580
It might be that there could be some new features landing,

1155
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,900
but given that the fact that Unity 7

1156
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:47,140
is still active in 16.04,

1157
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,180
like I'm running it right now,

1158
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:51,580
I'm talking to you from my Unity 7 laptop,

1159
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:55,900
it's not that we're just going to throw it over the wall

1160
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,420
and to GitHub and say, there you go.

1161
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:59,820
It's still hosted on Launchpad.

1162
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,720
We still have all the build system in place.

1163
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,140
We still have the bug tracker in place and so on.

1164
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:06,420
So if we've got people in the community

1165
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:09,020
who want to get involved in that,

1166
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:11,260
then get in contact with us.

1167
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:14,300
There's a thread going on on the Ubuntu Community Hub.

1168
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:17,100
If you go to community.ubuntu.com, you'll find it easily.

1169
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,460
It's the thread that says Unity 7 in it.

1170
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:22,060
And if you're a developer

1171
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:25,060
and you want to see Unity 7 continue,

1172
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:27,080
jump on board and we'll get this thing

1173
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:30,660
continue rolling through 18.04 and beyond.

1174
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:32,420
I would love an echo effect there, but-

1175
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,060
Beyond, beyond, beyond, beyond.

1176
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:34,880
I'll be your backup guy.

1177
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,580
I am, I'm not surprised.

1178
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:41,100
Not going to say I'm surprised at all by this development.

1179
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,860
In fact, I now feel kind of stupid

1180
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:44,420
that we didn't have a betting pool going,

1181
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:47,740
but part of me, for some reason,

1182
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:50,100
feels like this is the desktop environment to run

1183
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,180
on the OBS system.

1184
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:55,900
I like Unity 7 enough and I want something-

1185
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:56,740
Yeah, at the end,

1186
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:58,100
I really didn't have any major problems with it.

1187
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,460
Literally.

1188
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:02,620
How long have we had this machine running now, Beard?

1189
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:05,200
I mean, it's been since Linux Fest, right?

1190
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,040
Yeah.

1191
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:07,820
At least, yeah.

1192
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:09,020
And that's the thing.

1193
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:12,380
It just keeps rocking and keeps rolling along

1194
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:13,220
and along and along.

1195
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:15,300
It's literally the least trouble I've had.

1196
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,140
Right.

1197
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:19,740
We're not making massive multi-infrastructural changes

1198
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,420
to Unity 7.

1199
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,900
There's bug fixes, sure.

1200
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,060
There are bugs in Unity 7.

1201
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:24,900
We all know that.

1202
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,540
There are bugs in Compiz and Nuxt

1203
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:29,740
and the other components that make up Unity 7 experience.

1204
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:31,420
And if people want to get involved,

1205
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:32,600
we'd love to hear from you.

1206
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,300
But yeah, we'd love it to stay alive.

1207
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,900
But Compiz is still maintained, right?

1208
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,020
That is actually still being actively maintained.

1209
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:44,180
So in a way, that's sort of the core part of Unity 7

1210
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:45,380
that really needs any TLC.

1211
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,540
And if there's even somebody just nudging that along

1212
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:50,280
to make sure it still works with X or whatever.

1213
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:54,580
I think a lot of it will be integrating with new stuff

1214
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:56,740
that comes along and making sure it still works

1215
00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:00,440
on new versions of whatever components come along

1216
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,580
within the next six months.

1217
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:06,280
It's a short cycle between now and April next year.

1218
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:10,400
I know that the desktop team don't have a huge amount

1219
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,560
of time to dedicate to this

1220
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,960
because they're obviously working on the LTS,

1221
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,720
which is going to be Gnome Shell based.

1222
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,840
But I'm sure there are people there who would mentor people

1223
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,640
in the community who want to get involved in this.

1224
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,760
And if you're interested, I'd love to hear from you.

1225
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,760
What a hell of a thing.

1226
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,300
I'm going to seriously give it a consideration

1227
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:29,680
for the OBS rig, because it's worked so damn well

1228
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,960
for the other Skype machine.

1229
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,160
When I say it's a Skype machine,

1230
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,240
it runs like a dozen other apps too,

1231
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,500
just for different tasks.

1232
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,640
Like one of them is it runs a digital version

1233
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,880
of our soundboard.

1234
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,680
I have it up right now on the screen.

1235
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,040
I have, isn't that great?

1236
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:42,880
Yeah, it's awesome.

1237
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:43,700
It is so great.

1238
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:48,900
Our soundboard has a Linux client

1239
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,960
that connects over Ethernet, over IP,

1240
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:56,800
and it is exactly synced by the millisecond.

1241
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,520
And if I move a slider on the digital soundboard,

1242
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,000
it physically moves the slider with the motor

1243
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,400
on the physical soundboard, yeah.

1244
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,600
If I didn't have a Dan's face there during tech snap,

1245
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,440
that's going to be right there.

1246
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,840
Oh yeah, it's a real winner.

1247
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:10,720
But you want your machine to be pretty rock solid

1248
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,440
that you're controlling your soundboard from,

1249
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,960
and this has been the one.

1250
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:17,400
And I really, really like Solus.

1251
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,160
I've really enjoyed Budgie,

1252
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:22,680
but we had about 25 minutes this morning.

1253
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:23,840
It's kind of unbelievable.

1254
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,080
Yeah, of like, GNOME MPV has died

1255
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,200
for the third or fourth time,

1256
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,800
and this time it's blaming, ironically, I think,

1257
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:36,320
lib systemd.so.0, which is really great.

1258
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,160
We don't talk about such things.

1259
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,100
And I'm in the process of trying to do all the updates,

1260
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,040
even the optional ones,

1261
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,640
just trying to get the system working again.

1262
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,160
And I've had some weirdness in the software center

1263
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,860
where it said I had like 46 updates,

1264
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:50,880
and then I hit apply and it's like 146 updates.

1265
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,160
It was a big discrepancy.

1266
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:57,640
And those kinds of things, they're not a big problem,

1267
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:00,480
but it did delay the show by a pretty good factor today.

1268
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,720
I don't know.

1269
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,520
I feel like you just don't have that problem.

1270
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,400
Not having a functioning video player

1271
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,400
and not having audio are pretty big problems.

1272
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,680
Yeah, I'm trying to be nice because I really like Solus.

1273
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,600
I really like, and I don't,

1274
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:14,640
I might've got caught mid-update cycle or who knows.

1275
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,840
So I can't really say what the problem was.

1276
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,320
And that doesn't necessarily mean

1277
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,560
there's not a place for Solus, right?

1278
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,400
Like this machine can dual boot.

1279
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,680
You can play with multiple things.

1280
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:24,520
Oh yeah, absolutely.

1281
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:25,360
A lot of this we ended up talking about

1282
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,200
the appliance machines where you just don't,

1283
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,480
you don't want to fuss.

1284
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,800
Now we're in a place with snaps and just

1285
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,800
using newer Ubuntu's where you have enough of the,

1286
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:34,640
you know what I mean?

1287
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,880
Like, okay, 12.04, OBS wasn't really a thing.

1288
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,360
You couldn't expect an updated package,

1289
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:41,880
but in the 17 and 18 worlds, you get a recent build,

1290
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,160
let alone their snaps.

1291
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,280
Took them a few days, but now there is a new build.

1292
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,680
And Docker and other, it's kind of a different world.

1293
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,520
That's true.

1294
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,240
Where an Ubuntu LTS can fit a lot more roles now.

1295
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,220
So not only are people in general

1296
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:54,560
updating their repos faster.

1297
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:58,440
So when 17.10 came out, there was no OBS package for 17.10,

1298
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,960
but you know, you check three or four days later,

1299
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,580
now there's an OBS package.

1300
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:04,260
And snaps and flat packs also neutralize

1301
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:06,300
that particular problem, like you're saying.

1302
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:09,660
There is several, yeah, no, it's true.

1303
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:13,480
There are several solutions that are converging together

1304
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:16,520
to solve the software availability problem

1305
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,160
for all distributions.

1306
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,160
Depending on which particular methodology you subscribe to,

1307
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,200
there's multiple of them, there's multiple now.

1308
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:25,160
And that means, like you're saying,

1309
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:30,040
it would be conceivable to just, to take a little time

1310
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,800
and have like that classic reason

1311
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,520
why a lot of us switched to Linux,

1312
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,320
because Windows was so crashy

1313
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,340
and you wanted the most rock solid system possible.

1314
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:40,840
Like, I'm gonna get back to that.

1315
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:45,840
Like maybe I'll just use Unity 7 on 18.04

1316
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:49,240
with just a few confined applications.

1317
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,500
And I bet you that thing would run

1318
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:55,360
until the day that 18.04 was no longer supported.

1319
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,360
That sounds really appealing to me.

1320
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,840
That doesn't mean I'm gonna do that on my laptop

1321
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:01,280
or my main workstation, but the three or four machines,

1322
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,220
one, two, three, four machines,

1323
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:05,500
that we need five machines that we might reload in here.

1324
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:06,960
Yeah, I might do it to those.

1325
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,040
The other nice thing, which I'm still loving,

1326
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,640
is just you get the ZFS module,

1327
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,640
you don't have to do any wacky DKMS or precompile.

1328
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,540
So like, we can also do that

1329
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:16,960
and then take snapshots of machines

1330
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:17,800
that are particularly important

1331
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,400
so we can have restores or easy backups.

1332
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,200
There's still a lot of options going on here.

1333
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,000
What I'm hearing is Wes is upgrading the studio.

1334
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,080
I think that's what's happening.

1335
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,880
Yep, I just signed up for it.

1336
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,400
So this discussion about reloading the machines

1337
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,520
in the studio, it's happening.

1338
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:33,200
This is something I've been working on

1339
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:37,200
slowly over last week, after our episode last week.

1340
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,040
Hello, hello.

1341
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:41,320
You know, I heard somebody told me this recently

1342
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,680
that they never hear the airplanes that we mentioned,

1343
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:43,520
so I'm gonna stop mentioning

1344
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,520
if there's airplanes flying overhead.

1345
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:45,360
Yeah, if you guys can't hear it,

1346
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,360
it'll just be our little secret.

1347
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,920
Yeah, we'll all be the only ones that know.

1348
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,200
Anyways, back on track.

1349
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,720
This week, I started loading

1350
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,640
like my lower priority systems to 1710.

1351
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:57,160
And I've been working my way up the chain to the studio.

1352
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,800
And now I'm at the studio.

1353
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,440
And so I wanted to take a moment

1354
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,160
and figure out another solution

1355
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,960
while we're in this transition.

1356
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,200
And that's when it really struck me,

1357
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,400
this is a case for setting up a remote desktop environment.

1358
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,180
One on the LAN and one in the cloud.

1359
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:17,520
So that way, why we destroy the installations

1360
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,000
of these machines, and then begin to reset them up

1361
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,440
with all the little teensy-tinesy things we need.

1362
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,760
In a pinch, when I'm on air,

1363
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:28,040
I could remote into a system that is completely configured,

1364
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,560
has been for maybe a couple of weeks

1365
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:31,320
before the transition even started.

1366
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,080
So it's well used.

1367
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,300
It's been well set up.

1368
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,360
I can remote into that box.

1369
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,380
And it doesn't matter if the system here in the studio

1370
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:40,720
is a blank slate.

1371
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,160
Because inside that remote session,

1372
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,620
I'll have everything I need.

1373
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:44,680
But to make that work,

1374
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:48,320
it has to be extremely high-performant.

1375
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,520
Because I wanna be able to show visuals on the screen.

1376
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,840
I can't have crazy, weird lag.

1377
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:53,680
I can't-

1378
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,800
It's gotta meet your regular standards

1379
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,440
for a desktop usable system.

1380
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:57,400
Yeah, and if possible,

1381
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,320
I'd like to use it for work during the day.

1382
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,280
So I'd like it to be pretty responsive.

1383
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,760
So that's pretty responsive

1384
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,560
and maybe even support video playback.

1385
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:07,680
And so that is what led me down this path

1386
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,520
to where I'm at today.

1387
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:14,520
And I would say this is still somewhat in flux.

1388
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:15,920
Like one of the things I'm considering

1389
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,080
is instead of using the Monte desktop,

1390
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,600
maybe try a system,

1391
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:22,200
like a parallel system running XFCE.

1392
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,040
You know what?

1393
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:23,860
I'll explain why in a moment.

1394
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:24,700
Because Monte has been pretty good,

1395
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:27,580
but I have had a couple of hiccups.

1396
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:28,920
So if you're considering doing this,

1397
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,320
I wanna pre-warn you.

1398
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,640
It might not be a big deal,

1399
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:32,880
but I just wanna pre-warn you.

1400
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,040
So let's take a moment.

1401
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,800
Let's think DigitalOcean.

1402
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:40,960
Go to digitalocean.com, create the account.

1403
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,520
And use our promo code Linux Unplugged.

1404
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:46,040
It's a way to get really fast systems

1405
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:47,760
up in their infrastructure,

1406
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:51,000
which is data centers all over the world within seconds.

1407
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
SSDs for every system you deploy

1408
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,800
and a beautiful dashboard to manage all of it.

1409
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,200
And there's still a few days left

1410
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,920
to get in on this Hacktober fest.

1411
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,320
Are you hip to this Hacktober stuff?

1412
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:03,080
No, tell me more, tell me more.

1413
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,840
Well, first of all, DigitalOcean is just pretty awesome

1414
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:06,060
because this at the end of the day

1415
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:08,520
is just supporting a bunch of open source projects.

1416
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,920
It's getting open source code written

1417
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,680
and then giving people some swag for doing it.

1418
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,880
Did I get a t-shirt if I do this maybe?

1419
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,280
Yeah, you actually, you'd be good at this.

1420
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,040
So Hacktober fest is open to everyone in the world.

1421
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,160
Poll requests can be made

1422
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,640
on any GitHub hosted repository or project.

1423
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:25,540
And you sign up anytime between October 1st and October 31st.

1424
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:29,160
You make four poll requests between October 1st and 31st

1425
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,920
in any time zone.

1426
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,640
It can be to any public repo on GitHub,

1427
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,400
not just the ones that they've highlighted.

1428
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,840
The poll request must contain

1429
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,480
commits you've made yourself,

1430
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,960
poll requests reported by maintainers of spam,

1431
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,880
or they are automated, will be marked as invalid.

1432
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:42,720
It won't count.

1433
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,120
But they have a couple of examples here.

1434
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,760
And they're all open source projects.

1435
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,440
And there's some open source projects

1436
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:49,680
we talk about all the time.

1437
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,560
Some of them are less known.

1438
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:55,000
Like here's one for Discord, discord.net.

1439
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,160
That's interesting.

1440
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,760
Thanks.

1441
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:01,240
They had a Rocket Chat on here earlier.

1442
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:03,320
They have nw.js on here.

1443
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,000
They have Hugo, which is really interesting.

1444
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,560
It's a really cool, flexible static site generator.

1445
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:08,400
Written in Go.

1446
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,960
Yeah, and so the idea is just to give a little help

1447
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,440
and exposure to some of these open source projects

1448
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:17,480
and then also give away some swag.

1449
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,520
So that's their Hacktoberfest.

1450
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:19,600
It goes to the end of the month

1451
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,000
and it's open to anybody in the whole dang world.

1452
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,160
Digitalocean.com.

1453
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,520
Go there, try them out.

1454
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,640
I'm gonna be talking about them in this coming segment

1455
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:30,120
because one of the two remote desktop sessions I've set up

1456
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,840
is running on DigitalOcean.

1457
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,220
And one of the things I did

1458
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:35,800
is I got the three cents an hour system.

1459
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:40,800
And then I attached 100 gigabytes of block storage,

1460
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,960
which I am dedicating just to my home directory.

1461
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,520
That's on spinning rust, right?

1462
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:45,360
That's like really slow.

1463
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:46,720
That's all SSDs, my friend.

1464
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:47,560
Okay, okay.

1465
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:48,400
Yeah, yeah.

1466
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,520
In fact, it's extremely fast.

1467
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,180
It's nuts, nuts fast.

1468
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:54,440
In fact, I invite you to play around with it.

1469
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,820
It's really satisfying.

1470
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:58,400
And so I just dedicated from 100 gigs

1471
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,880
of DigitalOcean block storage to my droplet

1472
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,120
that runs remote desktop.

1473
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:05,220
So I have a big old home drive,

1474
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:06,480
which I really, really like.

1475
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,840
They have a new object storage system

1476
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,240
they call Spaces as well.

1477
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,360
And the network is blazing fast.

1478
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:13,860
40 gigabit connections coming into their hypervisors.

1479
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:14,700
Go check them out.

1480
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:18,040
Go to DigitalOcean.com and use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

1481
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,400
It's DigitalOcean.com.

1482
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,360
Use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

1483
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,920
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean

1484
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,840
for sponsoring this year Linux Unplugged program.

1485
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:29,760
So yeah, I'm using X2GO.

1486
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,400
And I'm using it with Ubuntu MATE.

1487
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,560
And it's pretty good.

1488
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,000
I'll give you guys a demo here in a minute

1489
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,600
if you're watching, you'll see.

1490
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,720
But even if you're listening, I'll describe it to you.

1491
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:42,360
And to make this all hum, I'm using X2GO

1492
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:44,480
on top of Ubuntu MATE 17.10.

1493
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,300
17.10 for both the systems.

1494
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,800
To do that on DigitalOcean at this point,

1495
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,960
I had to install a 17.04 image.

1496
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:53,280
And then I did an upgrade to 17.10, which went fine.

1497
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,120
Just totally fine.

1498
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:56,000
It was a pretty clean base system too.

1499
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,860
I even realized I could have snapshoted it

1500
00:55:58,860 --> 00:55:59,700
if anything had gone wrong.

1501
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:00,540
But I just didn't.

1502
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:01,960
Yeah, use them features.

1503
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:06,960
Yeah, and what I love, love, love about X2GO

1504
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,640
is that you can run it on a headless system

1505
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,440
that doesn't have a full X setup,

1506
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,360
doesn't have a monitor, mouse, and keyboard.

1507
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:16,640
So it works on a system that's just up in a rack somewhere.

1508
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:21,080
And X2GO is a graphical remote desktop

1509
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,360
that works really well over low bandwidth connections.

1510
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:25,040
It has a lot of scaling options.

1511
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,420
It has the ability to disconnect

1512
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:27,960
and then reconnect to a session.

1513
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,160
So I can be working, close it,

1514
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,640
come down into the studio and reconnect.

1515
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,500
Everything's right back where I left it off.

1516
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:33,960
It has sound redirection.

1517
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:37,880
It's a little wonky sometimes, but it supports pulse audio.

1518
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,920
And it has support for shared folders,

1519
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,880
which I have not really tried.

1520
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:43,920
I did not know that.

1521
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,920
Yeah, my understanding is it's using SFTP

1522
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:46,880
on the backend to do that.

1523
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,160
Though I guess you could set up,

1524
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,600
there's a lot of options for that.

1525
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:52,720
Yeah, all the traffic is tunneled over SSH.

1526
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,320
And so everything's going over SSH.

1527
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:58,320
What makes X2GO cooler than just say like

1528
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,840
straight old traditional X1140?

1529
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:01,680
Because a lot of people would just say,

1530
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,720
well, we'll just use SSH with X1140

1531
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,680
and then you don't need to install any extra packages.

1532
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:09,720
But X2GO uses the NX library,

1533
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,940
which was developed by No Machine.

1534
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:14,840
And they stopped releasing it as open source

1535
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:15,680
a little while ago.

1536
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:19,360
But X2GO is based off the last released open source version

1537
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,520
and it has been approved upon.

1538
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:26,520
And it has basically solved all of the latency intensive

1539
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:29,040
parts of X1140.

1540
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,440
And they've worked around those really latency intensive

1541
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:35,200
parts by creating an NX proxy on each side

1542
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,040
of the network connection.

1543
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,880
So on the client and on the server.

1544
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,800
And then it's sending compressed updates

1545
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,280
between the two proxies.

1546
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,520
And so X is getting immediate response

1547
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:44,680
from these two proxies.

1548
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:47,920
And then they handle the transferring of all of that stuff

1549
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,680
in a much more efficient means.

1550
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:54,000
And by doing so, you only have to install a few extra X stuff

1551
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:54,840
to get X2GO working.

1552
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:57,560
You don't have to have a full X2GO graphical environment.

1553
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:00,720
And I'll have the commands you need to run

1554
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,320
to install that in the show notes.

1555
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:07,320
And I'll tell you what guys, it is pretty impressive.

1556
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,000
It is pretty impressive how fast you can get.

1557
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,760
Now there's just certain limitations I'll go into,

1558
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,080
but just as a base start,

1559
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,880
if you start with a desktop environment

1560
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,040
that is not composited,

1561
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:20,360
so like your Mates or an XFCE,

1562
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:23,240
so Gnome 3 and Unity 7 and Plasma Desktop,

1563
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,720
the latest versions are all kind of out

1564
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:28,000
unless you use software rendering.

1565
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,080
And there is a way to get it working

1566
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:33,000
with Gnome fallback mode to the classic mode,

1567
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,920
but I chose not to do that.

1568
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:39,200
So if you use like a 2D desktop basically,

1569
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:42,840
you get essentially damn near local performance

1570
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,600
on the LAN and scaling performance

1571
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:45,960
on your remote connection.

1572
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:49,840
I went with Mate and the main problem I've had so far

1573
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:54,400
is I will open up a resume session on different computers

1574
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,920
at different resolutions.

1575
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,080
And sometimes the system tray area of Mate

1576
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,000
just is really gummed up.

1577
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,040
Like all of my notification icons

1578
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,800
all be stacked on top of each other.

1579
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,280
Yeah, that seems like a tricky area.

1580
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,400
And here's what happened.

1581
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,600
So I set up Dropbox because I want to get

1582
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,640
all of my unfiltered clips on both systems

1583
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:14,440
so I can edit that stuff remotely.

1584
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:16,880
And I'll talk more about that in a second.

1585
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:19,720
So I set up my install Dropbox

1586
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:21,440
because I'm still using Dropbox for the unfiltered show

1587
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,400
because we have like a terabyte of data in there.

1588
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,840
It's a hard thing to move around.

1589
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,640
It's actually more than a terabyte of data.

1590
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,560
And so I started installs.

1591
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,280
And now the way Dropbox works on Linux

1592
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,160
is it starts syncing instantly.

1593
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,600
Starts just immediately as soon as you connect

1594
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:35,960
to your Dropbox account.

1595
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,120
And I go in there and I use selective syncs.

1596
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,680
That way I only pull down about like 10, 15 gigs

1597
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:43,240
of the over a terabyte of data.

1598
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:45,120
But because all of these icons in the system tray

1599
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:49,840
all stacked all over each other in some weird crappy bug

1600
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,640
after the screen size had changed,

1601
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:53,200
I kept right clicking on the system tray

1602
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,280
and getting everything but the Dropbox icon.

1603
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,440
Well, this is on a DigitalOcean droplet.

1604
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,440
And this thing's pulling down my Dropbox

1605
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,680
at just maddening speeds.

1606
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,520
It's filling the disk at just an unbelievable rate.

1607
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:05,640
And I'm like, I-

1608
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:07,520
Just load testing Dropbox for them.

1609
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,040
Yeah, I was like, I got no option

1610
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,680
because I can't get to this icon

1611
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,880
to go into selective sync mode because of this.

1612
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,480
So I had to kill the entire desktop session

1613
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,760
and log back in.

1614
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:19,720
So that way the system tray bar little area,

1615
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,720
notification applet area would get redrawn.

1616
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:24,320
You're saying Dropbox needs a text-based config file.

1617
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,560
Well, it needs some sort of like-

1618
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:27,400
No, I'm just trolling.

1619
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,360
It does have a command line actually,

1620
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,360
but it needs some way to talk to the GUI version

1621
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,680
from the command line.

1622
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,280
And then once I logged back in,

1623
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,960
redrew the system tray area,

1624
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,440
I was able to solve the problem.

1625
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:39,440
But quite a bit of gigabytes have been downloaded by then.

1626
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,380
Where I feel like maybe XFCE wouldn't have had

1627
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:43,040
that problem, perhaps.

1628
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,440
You're probably right about that.

1629
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,440
So I'm just gonna play with that,

1630
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,520
but I have Monte on both of them right now.

1631
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,520
Bashful, you wanted to jump in about compositing desktops.

1632
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,840
I would love to talk about that for a second

1633
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,920
because that would, oh, I would love to get

1634
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,920
like a Gnome 3 remote desktop session if that's possible.

1635
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:59,280
Well, so just to give a little history,

1636
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,320
with my day job, we work in this exact space

1637
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:03,760
except more on the performance side,

1638
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,720
like leveraging GPUs and such for a bunch of our clients

1639
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,760
like Pixar and all those guys.

1640
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:12,680
So a lot of them, even with the performance stuff,

1641
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:15,040
they still traditionally go without compositing.

1642
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:18,160
So while you can get the performance for CAD

1643
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,920
and video editing and even like video streaming

1644
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:23,400
and so on and so forth, a lot of the desktop stuff

1645
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,680
people still tend to disable.

1646
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,900
Okay, and that was sort of what I kind of come to

1647
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:32,300
is in my rig that I have here on the land of the studio,

1648
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:34,480
where I can get to the OBS files

1649
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:37,760
and I can talk to all the other machines on the network,

1650
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,600
that's the machine I have the GTX 960 in,

1651
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,520
where if I need to do some sort of GPU job,

1652
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:43,880
that would be the remote desktop.

1653
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:45,800
So here's my setup, tell me what you guys think.

1654
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,800
I got the two rigs, I've got orbital and suborbital.

1655
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,340
Orbital is a system up at DigitalOcean

1656
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:54,220
and its key strengths are insane bandwidth,

1657
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:56,160
it's just incredible bandwidth performance

1658
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,080
and essentially unlimited disk,

1659
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:59,480
I just gotta throw money at the problem

1660
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:02,640
and very, very, very fast disk, as well as snapshots,

1661
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,600
so it's a good system to take risks on.

1662
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:05,420
So that's my orbital system.

1663
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:07,920
And then you could probably, if you needed to,

1664
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:08,760
you could destroy it and rebuild it,

1665
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,400
let's say you were hanging out in Singapore

1666
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,200
and you wanted it local there.

1667
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,200
Or move it.

1668
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:16,280
So that's orbital, and then I have suborbital,

1669
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:18,860
which is here in the studio and it's primary,

1670
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:20,880
it's the same, I'm trying to match the interfaces

1671
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:21,800
as much as possible.

1672
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:25,960
And suborbital's main advantages are local GPU

1673
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:29,920
with 960 with the NVIDIA proprietary driver,

1674
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,360
a fair amount of local storage, but not too much,

1675
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:34,360
not nearly what I have in the drop.

1676
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:36,280
And then, of course, the gigabit local access

1677
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:38,240
to all the studio resources.

1678
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,640
And for me, it is sort of like,

1679
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:42,920
it's sort of great, because if I have

1680
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:45,480
a network-intensive job, I log into one system,

1681
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:46,920
and if I have a compute-intensive job,

1682
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:48,920
I can log into the other system.

1683
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:51,040
And I'm kind of playing with the idea

1684
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:52,360
of trying to figure out all the ways

1685
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:54,360
I could sync more of the settings

1686
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,200
to make sure if I change something in one system,

1687
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:58,160
it synchronizes to the other system.

1688
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,020
I'd really like to start looking into that now.

1689
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:00,860
But again, I've really got to-

1690
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,280
We're just right back to configuration management,

1691
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,120
aren't we, on this episode?

1692
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:04,720
I guess so, oh boy, it really is.

1693
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:05,600
But then I've really got to nail down

1694
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:06,560
that desktop environment.

1695
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:07,400
Yes.

1696
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:09,720
What do you think, Bashul?

1697
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,900
You say Mate is the winner, Mate?

1698
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:18,040
Yeah, it is, kind of by far, too.

1699
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:20,840
I was running it for quite a while at work here,

1700
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:23,360
and out of all the desktops, it was the only one

1701
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:26,240
that was decent if you wanted a full-blown desktop,

1702
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:28,240
versus going with like a pilot manager.

1703
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,440
Did you try XFCE?

1704
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:32,440
At the, let me think about this, all right?

1705
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,320
You know what, I'm not gonna say yay or nay on that.

1706
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,440
Now you got me thinking, I might go load one

1707
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:37,280
just to test on-

1708
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,120
I'd be curious, I'd be curious.

1709
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:41,840
The thing that really blows me away about X to go,

1710
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:44,080
if you're putting it on Ubuntu or Arch,

1711
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:46,440
actually it's in Solus too, but if you're doing it

1712
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:50,440
on Ubuntu, it's you add a PPA, and you do all the dance

1713
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:53,640
you have to do to update your sources list.

1714
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:56,720
But then it's just, it's really, you just need two packages

1715
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,040
if you already have two packages.

1716
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:00,520
Two packages, if you already have Monte installed,

1717
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,400
or whatever desktop environment you want.

1718
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,320
You just have to apt-get install X to go server,

1719
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:07,800
and X to go server dash X session.

1720
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:10,240
Not all of Xorg, like it'll pull in its dependencies

1721
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,000
that it needs, but you don't have to pull,

1722
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,880
it is really simple to create a system on a VPS,

1723
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,360
like DigitalOcean or any other one,

1724
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,280
and install these couple of packages,

1725
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:23,280
and then you remote into it, and you're the display,

1726
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,760
you don't need a display attached.

1727
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:27,680
Because the way X to go works is it has,

1728
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:29,080
sort of like if you're familiar with Citrix

1729
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:30,760
and other remote desktop clients,

1730
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:33,560
it has a client manager, a session manager,

1731
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:35,440
where you can have multiple servers listed there,

1732
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:36,560
and you can set different settings,

1733
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:37,560
and different compression settings

1734
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:38,660
for the different servers.

1735
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:40,160
You can set up your shared folders.

1736
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,420
It's all done with a graphical interface.

1737
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:43,480
It's all in the GUI.

1738
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,400
It's so straightforward.

1739
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,360
In fact, I'll give you a little demo.

1740
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:50,240
Because it's not perfect, it's definitely not perfect,

1741
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,260
but it's pretty powerful, and I would definitely

1742
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:54,960
trade the power for perfection in this particular case.

1743
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:59,100
And all of this stuff is really sort of,

1744
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,160
kind of basic, like if you just leave the defaults,

1745
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:05,840
you're gonna generally be okay.

1746
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:07,440
Let's take a moment to thank Linux Academy,

1747
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,800
because honestly, if any of this stuff

1748
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,880
sounds interesting to you, you could dive in even deeper

1749
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,040
over at Linux Academy, so this would be

1750
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,040
a good moment to do this.

1751
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,960
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

1752
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:19,280
Go there to sign up and get a free seven-day trial.

1753
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,440
They have self-paced, in-depth video courses,

1754
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:24,560
hands-on, scenario-based labs that really help it stick

1755
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:27,400
and instructor mentoring by real human beings

1756
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,120
when you get stuck and need some help.

1757
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:30,980
And course scouts are when you're busy,

1758
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:32,880
comprehensive study guides you can download

1759
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,080
and take with you, and audio nuggets

1760
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:37,840
that are sparkly bits of wisdom that you can deep dive into,

1761
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:40,800
and a community that's full of clones of Westpain.

1762
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,200
It's kind of weird, actually.

1763
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,640
Yeah, we get along great, it's awesome.

1764
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:47,480
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

1765
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:50,060
They also have iOS and Android apps,

1766
01:05:50,060 --> 01:05:52,200
and flashcards that get forked.

1767
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,120
It's a pretty great platform, really.

1768
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:58,320
If you think about it, it's something that would be like,

1769
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,400
if you could just take all of Linux Academy

1770
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:03,400
and go back in time and give it to yourself

1771
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,880
like eight, 10 years, you'd be like Biff

1772
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,480
bringing back the playbook.

1773
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:10,000
You could get so ahead of everybody.

1774
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:12,940
It's one of our precious resources.

1775
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:15,580
We should launch it up and encapsulate it in a satellite

1776
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:17,080
for future humanity.

1777
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:17,920
That's how important it is.

1778
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,600
Or for aliens, they need it, too.

1779
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:20,440
That's true.

1780
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:21,560
I mean, Linux is gonna be the kernel

1781
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:23,200
that takes over their world once they learn about it.

1782
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,560
The GPL is a viral license.

1783
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:25,680
Yeah, exactly, we all know.

1784
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,800
So go get hedged now.

1785
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:28,640
It's kind of wild.

1786
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:31,600
I have to say, you're motivated, right?

1787
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:32,440
You wanna learn Linux.

1788
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:33,260
You're listening to this show.

1789
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:35,220
Obviously, you're interested in these topics.

1790
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:37,560
But when you have a job and a family,

1791
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:39,800
and you have the end of the day and you're tired,

1792
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:41,800
there's a million reasons that you can come up with

1793
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:42,840
not to learn something.

1794
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:43,680
Go girl.

1795
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,160
But Linux Academy breaks down

1796
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:46,760
every single possible barrier.

1797
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:48,720
They can't actually make you type things

1798
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:51,000
and do the learning, but everything else

1799
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,120
is set up right for you.

1800
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:53,320
It's so true. It's awesome.

1801
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:55,360
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

1802
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:58,360
Big thank you to them for sponsoring the unplugged program.

1803
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:00,400
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged

1804
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,120
is where you get a free seven day trial,

1805
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:04,160
and you support this here shenanigans.

1806
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:06,480
So I am in the process of reinstalling

1807
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,920
a bunch of packages on Solace.

1808
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:08,760
Oh, you know what?

1809
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:11,200
It launched just fine.

1810
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,520
Isn't that wonderful?

1811
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:15,000
So you have the X2Go client session manager.

1812
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,400
Were you gonna say something, Beard?

1813
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,720
I was just gonna ask, have you tested out X2Go at all

1814
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:21,920
on a more flaky connection?

1815
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:25,400
Well, on a MiFi, which is pretty, pretty crap.

1816
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:26,240
Pretty, pretty crap.

1817
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:27,400
What kind of bandwidth do you get on that thing?

1818
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,880
It ranges depending on the day.

1819
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:32,160
So it depends on which connection I'm on.

1820
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:36,560
So if I'm on a TIN connection, or an AT&T connection,

1821
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:38,600
or a public Wi-Fi connection,

1822
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:41,000
because I sort of use all of them.

1823
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,240
Listen to user error back catalogs for more information

1824
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:44,580
where I've outlined it all.

1825
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:48,160
And in there, I have a large variance.

1826
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:53,160
And I can get up to maybe seven megabits

1827
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:58,640
where I'm usually at, and I can get as low as easily

1828
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,440
as low as 400 kilobits a second.

1829
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:02,720
I mean, it can be a pretty dramatic range

1830
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,560
depending on how much bandwidth I've used,

1831
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:06,840
how loaded the network is, and all of those things.

1832
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:09,320
So I have tested this from everything from gigabit

1833
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:12,400
to probably around 500K a second.

1834
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,240
And so maybe that's a good place to start.

1835
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:15,640
We could take a look at this.

1836
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:20,640
So in X2GO, you have the client session manager.

1837
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:23,400
And I have two connections up right now.

1838
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:26,080
And let's take a look here at the sub-orbital one.

1839
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,840
This is the one here on the LAN.

1840
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:30,200
So this could be an example of how you would maybe do this.

1841
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:33,560
So I can disconnect my session, I can pause it right here.

1842
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:35,800
So I'm suspending a session I already have open,

1843
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:37,200
which is always a lot of fun.

1844
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,640
And then I can go in and I can edit that session.

1845
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:41,560
And I have my different options I can choose from.

1846
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:43,720
And in here, you can see the host,

1847
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,320
the username I want it to use by default,

1848
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:46,160
and the port.

1849
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:48,840
So if you're maybe forwarding a random ass port to 22,

1850
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:51,240
you could override that and put in here.

1851
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:52,800
You can, with a dropdown option,

1852
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,320
you can choose the desktop environment

1853
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:56,000
that you're gonna be logging into.

1854
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,480
So they have MATE right here in the dropdown already.

1855
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:01,560
They also have Unity, Cinnamon, Trinity,

1856
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:05,440
XD, MCP, connecting to a local desktop,

1857
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:09,720
and notably, support for connecting to an RDP server,

1858
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:11,040
a Windows terminal server.

1859
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:11,920
Oh, is that right?

1860
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:12,760
Mm-hmm.

1861
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:13,720
But here's the really interesting stuff.

1862
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,320
So on the Connection tab,

1863
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:18,240
this is where you have your connection speed preferences.

1864
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:21,120
And because I'm on a LAN, I have a slider.

1865
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:22,080
So that's that baby.

1866
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,600
Yeah, it goes everywhere from modem to LAN.

1867
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:27,360
And this change is not only compression,

1868
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:30,360
but what the size of the packets that get sent.

1869
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:33,240
And so when you're on a MiFi, you go to modem,

1870
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:34,900
and here on LAN, I can go to LAN.

1871
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:38,080
But then they have a million different compression options.

1872
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,000
This is something I spent some time playing with

1873
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,520
because they have, you can do no compression,

1874
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:44,960
you can do adaptive compression,

1875
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:49,400
but you can also say lock it in at 16 meg JPEG,

1876
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:52,960
or lock it in at 24k PNG.

1877
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:55,280
So you can choose different image compression

1878
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,960
depending on if your preference is speed or image quality.

1879
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:01,040
And I have found that the 16 meg JPEG

1880
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:02,200
has been pretty good for me.

1881
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,940
They also even have some RDP compression,

1882
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:06,520
which all works pretty well.

1883
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:09,280
And then they have your input and output for the size of it,

1884
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:11,440
the DPI, so if you're on a high DPI screen,

1885
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,680
you can pass that along to X2GO.

1886
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:14,840
So it does support high DPI,

1887
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:17,120
but you have to manually enter that in here.

1888
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,800
Then you have your sound options,

1889
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:22,280
so I can have it redirect sound to my local Pulse audio.

1890
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:23,720
You can use SSH port forwarding

1891
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:26,040
to tunnel the sound system connections through firewall,

1892
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:29,840
so you do not have to open up a separate port.

1893
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,560
And then on the shared media tab,

1894
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:33,480
in here is where you can add your local files,

1895
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:37,740
and it will use SFTP to actually transfer those files.

1896
01:10:37,740 --> 01:10:39,440
So now here, I'll show you what it's like to log in.

1897
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:41,480
So I'm logging into the one here on my LAN.

1898
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:44,940
In the background, I have, let me minimize that guy.

1899
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:45,780
In the background here,

1900
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:48,000
this is the system up on DigitalOcean right here.

1901
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,520
And you can actually start to see the problem right here

1902
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:53,340
in the system tray with this double volume icon thing

1903
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:54,180
that's going on.

1904
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:55,000
Oh yeah, I haven't seen that before.

1905
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,040
Mm-hmm, that's due to me changing the resolutions.

1906
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:01,960
But to Mate's credit, if I resize this X2GO window here,

1907
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:03,900
Mate will snap pretty well to that, boom,

1908
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:05,560
and it resizes pretty dynamically.

1909
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:07,440
So to its credit, I can't sit here,

1910
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,520
and I can screw around with the window size proportions,

1911
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,560
and Mate actually handles it pretty good.

1912
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:13,800
It's just sometimes those notification icons

1913
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:14,640
lose their crap.

1914
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:15,460
Yeah.

1915
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:18,700
But before I log into the local LAN system,

1916
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:20,440
while I have it up on the screen,

1917
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:22,680
here is the system that I have up on DigitalOcean.

1918
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,040
I call this one Orbital.

1919
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:24,940
I'll try to get it on the screen.

1920
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:25,780
And I just thought maybe,

1921
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:27,260
if you're watching the video version,

1922
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:28,800
I'd show you what the performance is like.

1923
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:29,840
Yeah, walk us around a bit.

1924
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:31,560
So let's open up, here's my file manager,

1925
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:34,980
and you can see, when I maximize the window,

1926
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:36,520
you can see there's a, it's pretty good.

1927
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:38,040
There's a real slight delay, but it's pretty usable.

1928
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:39,520
Here's me dragging the window around.

1929
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:43,000
Again, maybe not quite as smooth as,

1930
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:43,960
if I was running locally,

1931
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:45,840
I'd also be using Compass to them.

1932
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:48,640
But in terms of latency, when I type in terminal,

1933
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,620
it's right on the money for me.

1934
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:54,160
There's no delay there, right?

1935
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:55,440
It pops up on the window.

1936
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,440
I can start typing immediately.

1937
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:59,800
When I hit enter on commands,

1938
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,400
they'll show up instantaneously on screen.

1939
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:04,440
There's really, there's no delay here

1940
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:06,920
which would prevent me from working.

1941
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:08,880
Let's try browsing the web.

1942
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:11,040
This is usually the most challenging, actually,

1943
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,320
is this browsing the web thing,

1944
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:14,160
because it involves redrawing.

1945
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:15,480
You've even got it signed into your account,

1946
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:16,320
and look at this, that's great.

1947
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:17,880
Oh yeah, it's ready to go for me.

1948
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:19,720
Oh yeah, it's ready to go at all the times.

1949
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:21,480
This is actually probably the best test.

1950
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:24,360
Scrolling a complicated web page.

1951
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:25,640
This web page is Twitter,

1952
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:27,320
it has video playing on it right now,

1953
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:29,680
and you can see there's some sort of herky-jerky

1954
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:32,000
as it reloads, and there's a little bit of delay,

1955
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,680
like when I stop, it keeps going

1956
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:35,240
for just a brief moment.

1957
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:36,080
We could...

1958
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:37,920
And the remote server, we have to keep in mind,

1959
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,640
doesn't have any sort of GPU even integrated

1960
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:42,520
to help with the fancy rendering.

1961
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:43,880
Right, exactly, totally.

1962
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:45,960
So now let's compare that to,

1963
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:48,480
here, I'll log into my local system.

1964
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,800
Now this is with my compression settings

1965
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,320
basically saying, let's have at it.

1966
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:56,480
You're on a LAN connection, so let's just go nuts.

1967
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,680
And so this will kind of be a good comparison

1968
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:00,800
if you have a pretty fast connection.

1969
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,400
So that's a slower connection, what we just showed you.

1970
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:04,440
It's usable, it's very usable.

1971
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:06,560
There's just some herky-jerky when you're scrolling

1972
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,640
or dragging windows, but it's definitely usable.

1973
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:10,120
And if you're working in a terminal,

1974
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:11,960
you're working in a text editor,

1975
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:14,160
you're browsing web, you're chatting Telegram,

1976
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:17,040
all these things, Slack, all work just fine

1977
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,600
in that slower connection.

1978
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:21,660
But now let's take a look at the LAN speeds,

1979
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:23,480
where I feel like it really shines.

1980
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:26,580
Let's go back, we'll do the Twitter test here again.

1981
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:28,880
We'll make it nice and big so that way it's the same size.

1982
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,280
We start doing the scrolling much smoother.

1983
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,680
And it's right on point with me too.

1984
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:34,520
There's no latency.

1985
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:36,320
When I stop scrolling, it scrolls.

1986
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:40,240
This, you, if I didn't tell you this is a remote session,

1987
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:42,640
I don't think you would be able to tell on your own.

1988
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:45,880
I think you could legitimately sit down at this computer

1989
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:50,240
and not suspect this is a remote session.

1990
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:52,480
It is that performant over the LAN.

1991
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:54,140
This is key for me because that means

1992
01:13:54,140 --> 01:13:55,600
I can sit down at any of these systems

1993
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:59,120
and have a really great, really well-performing experience.

1994
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:01,480
So much so that, check this out.

1995
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:03,400
We'll go into the unfilter archive here

1996
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:05,080
and we can play a little cyber news.

1997
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:07,800
And the video actually plays.

1998
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:09,600
Are we gonna get full cyber here?

1999
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:10,520
This is their audio too.

2000
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:11,880
This is from the remote session.

2001
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:14,280
Is now putting nearly all of them at risk.

2002
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:15,120
Wow.

2003
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:16,440
A bug known as crack.

2004
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:17,280
No, not crack.

2005
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:18,920
Fundamental flaw in the technology.

2006
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:21,680
And that is live from my remote session,

2007
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:24,280
video and audio, and they're synced up.

2008
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:25,280
It's playable.

2009
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:27,160
I mean, it's damn impressive.

2010
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:29,960
And this is a headless Ubuntu box.

2011
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:30,800
That's awesome.

2012
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:31,680
Out in the garage right now.

2013
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:33,880
Side note, it's really fun to watch mainstream media

2014
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:35,320
try to cover things like that.

2015
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:36,160
Crack.

2016
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:38,800
Yeah, they are the worst at that, aren't they?

2017
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,000
So you can see there's a,

2018
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,440
so let's go just as a comparison note now.

2019
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:45,840
Let's go try to play that same video on the remote session.

2020
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,540
Cause again, I have these things pretty synced up.

2021
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:49,780
So I have sort of the same stuff on both systems.

2022
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:52,520
So we go play the same clip now on the remote session.

2023
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:53,720
Let's see how that works.

2024
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:55,920
Well, a security feature.

2025
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:58,240
Ooh, much herkier jerkier.

2026
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:01,440
Barely, not watchable.

2027
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:03,440
The audio is staying current though.

2028
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:04,600
That's impressive.

2029
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:05,600
Audio is staying current,

2030
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,240
but it is a disastrous slideshow.

2031
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:10,000
That could be because there's,

2032
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,460
I doubt if that's a GPU thing.

2033
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:13,280
I think that's just a compression thing.

2034
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:15,460
I'm pretty sure that's just compression.

2035
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:18,880
But it is such a game changer for me.

2036
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:19,700
That's awesome.

2037
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:21,280
Because it's still usable even over the MiFi.

2038
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:22,460
It's still completely usable.

2039
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:24,720
And I'm able to do bandwidth intensive things

2040
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:25,920
in the remote session.

2041
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,920
And then when it's time for me to come into the studio,

2042
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:30,720
I close the window and I sit back down at the system here

2043
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:32,280
and I reopen the window.

2044
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:33,920
And if I'm working off of suborbital,

2045
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:35,720
it's just super fast.

2046
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:37,700
But if I'm working off of the remote system,

2047
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:39,560
everything's the same, nothing's changed.

2048
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:42,880
And it performs great here on the connection for the studio.

2049
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:44,400
So X2GO is definitely worth a look.

2050
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,960
It's still very, very relevant.

2051
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:48,680
I don't know what its future is in a Wayland universe,

2052
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:51,800
but to be honest, I'm not as concerned about that yet.

2053
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:52,640
You'll get there.

2054
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:53,480
I don't think the production systems

2055
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:55,640
are going to Wayland in the next year or so.

2056
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:57,720
So that's a problem for future, Chris,

2057
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,160
in about two years, maybe.

2058
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:01,760
Unless that GNOME Wayland session doesn't crash so much.

2059
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:03,560
Or if Pipewire comes up with some really

2060
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:05,360
badass remote system.

2061
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,380
If anybody knows a way that's even more

2062
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:10,000
performed than X2GO, I absolutely would try it.

2063
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,960
Because video editing's still a little herky-jerky for me.

2064
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:15,040
I know that's a very high bar, but boy,

2065
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,240
wouldn't that be a treat.

2066
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:19,320
In the past, I've used XPRA, or it's also

2067
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:21,160
part of the WinSwitch project.

2068
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:23,460
I know WinSwitch supports multiple operating systems.

2069
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:25,920
I don't know how X2GO.

2070
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:27,840
And if you look online, if you search

2071
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:29,440
for a comparison between the two,

2072
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:32,080
you'll almost exclusively find Hacker News posts,

2073
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:33,840
Reddit posts asking for a comparison,

2074
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,280
and then no further comments.

2075
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:36,200
So it's a little bit different, and I

2076
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:37,240
haven't used both of them.

2077
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:40,140
But maybe XPRA is something you could try and just compare.

2078
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:42,600
In the past, I'd been running OBS on a droplet,

2079
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:44,520
and I'd been using that to control the stream,

2080
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:45,840
and that was working pretty nicely.

2081
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:48,000
I did not do any intensive editing, necessarily,

2082
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,080
so I can't speak to that.

2083
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:50,540
I'm not talking intensive editing.

2084
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:53,480
I'm talking like Avid Mux, clip off the end,

2085
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:56,320
clip off the beginning, grab 30 seconds of a clip,

2086
01:16:56,320 --> 01:17:00,040
very basic mark in out, mark the in, mark the out, export.

2087
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:02,840
So it might be worth just throwing that on that same droplet

2088
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:05,120
and just connecting up and seeing what the experience is like.

2089
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,800
Will you toss a link to that in the show notes section?

2090
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:07,280
I sure will.

2091
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:08,360
I would love to take a look at that.

2092
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:11,240
I mean, you were suggesting a couple other things, too.

2093
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:11,740
Go ahead.

2094
01:17:11,740 --> 01:17:14,040
I know you want to say something, seriously.

2095
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:17,320
You had suggested Splashtop, which

2096
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:19,520
could work because it basically encapsulates

2097
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:20,600
the entire desktop.

2098
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:21,880
Yeah, it's basically just a video stream.

2099
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:25,280
It's an H.264 stream, yeah, that then takes your inputs

2100
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:27,160
and outputs and forwards them.

2101
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:30,000
Kind of sounds like a water park ride, but that's just a perk,

2102
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:30,600
I guess.

2103
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:32,800
Splashtop might also be a good solution,

2104
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,840
but the thing I really like about X2GO

2105
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:40,120
is there's no session running at the physical machine.

2106
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:43,200
These are sessions that run headless

2107
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,280
that I can pop in and pop out of,

2108
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:47,600
and I could still go hook up a monitor, mouse, keyboard

2109
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,880
to that machine and log in at the desktop, I suppose,

2110
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:51,960
if I wanted to, at least on the local one.

2111
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:53,000
Really cool.

2112
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,080
There are ways to connect to the local desktop, too,

2113
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:58,680
so there is ways to connect to the running session.

2114
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:00,720
That's not what I'm using it for.

2115
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:02,800
Does anybody have any input in the Discord

2116
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:05,640
there on this particular topic or how they do remote desktop

2117
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:06,780
for Linux?

2118
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:10,080
And I am specifically going for remote desktop, not just SSH,

2119
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,840
because this is using SSH, actually.

2120
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:13,720
I have that as an option, too, now, obviously.

2121
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:14,960
Right, but you need the graphical thing.

2122
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:17,600
You already have a solution for remote terminals.

2123
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,440
We figured that out like 10 years ago.

2124
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:20,360
You know what works?

2125
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:22,240
If you do, by the way, in the Discord room,

2126
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:24,160
just toss a hand in the chat.

2127
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:26,640
You know what works super well for me

2128
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:30,760
is having a basic-bitch terminal that I'm sitting at that

2129
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:35,080
has a couple of X terminals or something,

2130
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:38,440
like whatever, that I can SSH into these boxes

2131
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:40,040
that I'm X2going into.

2132
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:43,320
So then I have a graphical interface,

2133
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:46,640
and in the background, I have an SSH terminal command line

2134
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:47,580
into that box.

2135
01:18:47,580 --> 01:18:49,960
And if anything gets weird in my graphical environment,

2136
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:52,480
I am one second away, less than a second away,

2137
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:54,200
from tabbing over to that terminal

2138
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:56,480
and killing a process or fixing the issue.

2139
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:59,840
It's like I have a backdoor into the main system

2140
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,680
I'm always working on in a way that gives me

2141
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:03,880
this really supreme confidence that I'm

2142
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:04,920
going to be able to handle anything that

2143
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:06,340
happens in that graphical session,

2144
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:08,800
because I've got this emergency persistent backdoor.

2145
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:11,300
And because both these systems, like the one on Digital Ocean

2146
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:14,560
on the LAN, are so rock solid, my SSH session

2147
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:16,680
has been running to both these systems now

2148
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:19,640
on one of my boxes for like six days without being broken.

2149
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:22,960
So the terminal is always there, always connected in.

2150
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:24,880
It's always just a couple of commands away.

2151
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:25,520
That's great.

2152
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:26,000
It is.

2153
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,080
It's just a cool way to work.

2154
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:27,760
I really like it.

2155
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:29,160
Bashful, you had a comment on GPU.

2156
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:29,640
Go for it.

2157
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:31,680
I'd love to hear about that.

2158
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:33,680
I'm just curious out of a bunch of the stuff

2159
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:35,180
that you've done research on, have you

2160
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:37,840
found anything that actually leverages the GPU?

2161
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:41,360
Well, I think Splashtop would, because it

2162
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:42,840
might be when it's encoding.

2163
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:46,960
For me, I don't need my desktop session to be composited.

2164
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:49,640
What I need the GPU for is encoding video,

2165
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:52,240
or potentially maybe running OBS,

2166
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:54,520
which maybe that's where I'd run into this problem.

2167
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:57,760
Because I do want to experiment with that as well.

2168
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:59,740
So I could see some workloads in the future

2169
01:19:59,740 --> 01:20:01,260
where it'd be a problem.

2170
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:04,640
Yeah, I know a couple of the big three

2171
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:09,160
are looking towards GPU workloads with remote desktop.

2172
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:11,560
But I'm wondering on the pricing behind it.

2173
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:14,440
There's already things that can leverage it both for the desktop

2174
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:17,280
session and so on and so forth, but it's pretty damn pricey.

2175
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:18,760
I could see for my orbital system,

2176
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:21,680
the one that I call it orbital because it's out in the cloud,

2177
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:25,580
I could see moving that to say if Amazon or somebody came

2178
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:28,720
around or your rack space or an Azure came around and said,

2179
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:30,600
we can do hosted Linux desktop.

2180
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:33,440
And it'll have a GPU, and you can connect to it

2181
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:37,160
from any operating system, and it's $25 a month.

2182
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:38,700
I may give it a serious consideration

2183
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:40,920
because this is a legitimate work tool for me.

2184
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:43,100
But it's going to be impossible for any of them

2185
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:46,120
to compete with suborbital, the system I have on the LAN,

2186
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:50,400
because that's got gigabit access to my OBS recording.

2187
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,680
It's got gigabit access to all the other machines.

2188
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:54,800
It's got physical hardware that I can come in

2189
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,000
and I can plug into it and then get access to.

2190
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,880
So maybe I want to one day plug in an SD card reader to it

2191
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:03,040
or something, weird stuff like that that I could never

2192
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:04,120
get in a hosted system.

2193
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:07,440
So to me, having these two boxes is the invaluable part

2194
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,460
because the orbital system is totally

2195
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:10,560
independent of the studio.

2196
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:13,480
If the studio goes offline or I'm in some weird place

2197
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:15,320
and it's way faster for me to connect to that,

2198
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:16,560
I've always got that.

2199
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:18,560
But I can't ever see replacing suborbital

2200
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:23,480
because that's unique because it's here on the LAN.

2201
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:26,480
I think the GPU instances are probably, at least not

2202
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:29,120
in the short term, never going to come in at like $25 a pop.

2203
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:30,640
If you just look at what it costs

2204
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:34,520
to go and rent one on Google Compute or Amazon or whatever,

2205
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:36,440
they're significantly more expensive.

2206
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:40,720
And that's not even running them full time.

2207
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,960
Well, I'm grateful that Mate works as well as it does,

2208
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:44,720
actually, really.

2209
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:46,440
When I look at how I can resize these windows

2210
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:48,640
and just sort of abuse it and it just sort of snaps back

2211
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:50,680
for the most part, I'm pretty grateful for that.

2212
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:53,840
And I'm really grateful that it has, I have put it,

2213
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:56,120
I took the Redmond layout and I've modified the Redmond

2214
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:58,160
layout, which puts essentially everything

2215
01:21:58,160 --> 01:21:59,640
in one bar at the bottom.

2216
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:02,160
So you have your task switcher, your launchers,

2217
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:02,960
your system tray.

2218
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,840
I'm not doing any docs or anything like that.

2219
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:06,600
I just have like some quick launch icons.

2220
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:10,120
And then I've got one of the Mate launchers here.

2221
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:12,720
I don't think it's Brisk, but maybe, oh yeah, it is Brisk.

2222
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:15,320
Yeah, in fact, I replaced the one it had for the Redmond

2223
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:16,480
and I added Brisk.

2224
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:20,880
And it's just so freaking functional.

2225
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:21,960
It's just unbelievable.

2226
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:26,600
Like I've got just, I could rave for two episodes

2227
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:28,320
about how there is really something

2228
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:29,800
to that just straightforward, practical,

2229
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:31,080
everything works as I expected.

2230
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:32,440
It's rock solid.

2231
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:34,640
I mean, these systems have been running for days now

2232
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:36,520
and I just pop in, pop out all the time

2233
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:37,880
and they're always there ready to work

2234
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:39,480
from whatever machine I'm connecting from.

2235
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:40,320
It's really great.

2236
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:41,520
And if you haven't played around with it,

2237
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:43,400
the barrier to entry is super low.

2238
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:46,680
I'll have the commands you need to run

2239
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:48,720
if you're on Ubuntu to install it.

2240
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:50,200
It's really just a few packages.

2241
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:51,920
It's also available on a lot of other distros.

2242
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:53,320
I really encourage you to play around with it,

2243
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:55,200
even if you're just playing around on your LAN

2244
01:22:55,200 --> 01:23:00,200
or you just want to get more use out of one

2245
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:02,160
really powerful system in your house

2246
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:03,520
because you can have multiple people logged in

2247
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:04,360
at the same time.

2248
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:05,600
Or even, I mean, like you can use it

2249
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,040
for more traditional things too,

2250
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:09,160
like supporting family members or others

2251
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:10,640
if you have that installed.

2252
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:11,760
If you have these instructions now,

2253
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:12,880
just get it set up one time

2254
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:14,880
and then when you need to jump on their box, there you go.

2255
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:17,480
But you could also, if money's tight,

2256
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:20,200
you could get one really nice family system

2257
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:21,160
and then just scrape together

2258
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:22,680
and get a couple of dumb terminals that are.

2259
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:23,760
I was immediately thinking about that.

2260
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:24,600
Yeah, right.

2261
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:25,440
Or Chromebook even.

2262
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:28,600
Get some Chromebooks and then the Chromebooks run next to go

2263
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:31,200
and they connect into it and the one central box

2264
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:33,240
in your house has got the i7, it's got the GPU,

2265
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:34,080
it's got the disk.

2266
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,400
You can also then easily manage backups

2267
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:36,600
and all kinds of stuff that way.

2268
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:38,060
Well, start thinking about how it changes

2269
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:39,360
your media management too.

2270
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:42,440
If I load MB on one of these things

2271
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:44,540
and I start just doing my downloads

2272
01:23:44,540 --> 01:23:46,100
and my media management on one of these things,

2273
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:48,720
then all of a sudden life just gets a lot easier

2274
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:51,100
because the MB server's running locally on the box,

2275
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:52,700
the media files are all locally on the box,

2276
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:54,500
I can remote into it and have local access

2277
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:55,800
or I can stream it over MB.

2278
01:24:00,180 --> 01:24:01,520
When you take a basically Linux

2279
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:02,620
or when you put a desktop on it

2280
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:04,380
is essentially what I've done.

2281
01:24:04,380 --> 01:24:06,500
There's actually surprisingly nice uses

2282
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:08,100
for having a desktop on a server

2283
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:10,080
if it's not hosting web pages

2284
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:11,860
or performing traditional server roles.

2285
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:14,840
If it's doing more like syncing your media,

2286
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:16,840
maybe downloading files for you, things like that,

2287
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:18,900
all of a sudden it's very useful.

2288
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:19,740
I really like it.

2289
01:24:19,740 --> 01:24:22,680
And it's a solution that's not new to me.

2290
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:24,800
I did something like this eight, nine years ago

2291
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,520
when I worked at a school

2292
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:28,700
that had very restrictive web filtering.

2293
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:30,760
I would remote into a physical box

2294
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:33,040
that I had in a rack in a data center somewhere.

2295
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:35,800
And I used No Machine back then, No Machine NX,

2296
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:37,580
which is what this is based off of.

2297
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:38,960
And it worked back then.

2298
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:41,840
And it's sort of an old idea

2299
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,460
and it just still really holds a lot of water,

2300
01:24:43,460 --> 01:24:46,760
especially with 1710, Ubuntu MATE,

2301
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:48,560
I'm not making any kind of compromise

2302
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:50,480
in a modern desktop environment.

2303
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:53,580
And you, I mean, as we all know, Chris, you're somewhat picky

2304
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:55,840
in terms of interactions, other things.

2305
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,960
So if this wasn't usable, you would be the first to say it.

2306
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:59,320
Oh, that's true, I would, yeah.

2307
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:02,040
And I'm still like, you know, I may try XFCE

2308
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:04,640
and if I could have a GPU accelerated composited desktop,

2309
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:05,600
I might like that.

2310
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:06,440
Right, yeah.

2311
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:08,560
I'll have to have one.

2312
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:09,440
We'll get there.

2313
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:10,680
Yeah, yeah, we'll get there.

2314
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:12,160
In the meantime, it gives me the freedom

2315
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:14,200
to sort of wreck havoc in the studio

2316
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:16,880
and at least know I've got a couple of escape hatches

2317
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:18,880
where all my stuff's already logged in, ready to go,

2318
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,640
Telegram's right there, Slack's right there,

2319
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:23,320
all my S, all my bookmarks, all my show notes.

2320
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:24,160
Can go on.

2321
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:26,720
Mm-hmm, and that's really what it's all about.

2322
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:30,040
And it really, you know, gosh, it's just so low overhead.

2323
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:32,240
I love that about open source software.

2324
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:33,800
Yeah, I didn't have to go spend hundreds of dollars

2325
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:35,440
to get some sort of remote desktop package.

2326
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:38,440
I didn't have to hassle with any of that.

2327
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:40,600
Not to, you know, not to overstress that,

2328
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:41,520
but that is just such a nice thing

2329
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:42,720
when you all of a sudden get a wild hair

2330
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:45,160
and you think, oh my gosh, I could solve this problem

2331
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:46,680
I'm about to have with free software.

2332
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:49,040
It really is empowering, it really is great.

2333
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:50,760
And that's the message right there we want to end on.

2334
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:54,120
But I'd love to hear what you do for remote desktop access,

2335
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:56,400
especially if you've got one that performs super, super well.

2336
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,200
Please, please let us know.

2337
01:25:58,200 --> 01:25:59,560

That subreddit definitely could use some love.

2341
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,840
Okay, Wes, guess what?

2342
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:09,040
It's time to end the show today.

2343
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:10,320
Yeah, yeah, Beardsley, how do you think

2344
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:12,040
the Discord test went, pretty good?

2345
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:12,880
Pretty good.

2346
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:14,800
We're gonna be back on Mumble while we evaluate,

2347

There is no excuse.

2357
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:32,200
Make it happen.

2358
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:34,600
Make it show, as Captain McQuarrie would say.

2359
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:36,360
Follow the network at Jupiter Signal.

2360
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:38,120
Thank you so much for tuning this week's episode

2361
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:40,360
and we'll see you back here next week

2362
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:42,920

2363
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:43,760
Say goodbye guys.

2364
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:44,600
Goodbye.

2365
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:45,440
Goodbye.

2366
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:46,800
Goodbye, Mama.

2367
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,800
I

2368
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:27,400
Think I got a little post show in me. Yeah

2369
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:35,640
Some posters bashful's got some follow-up some real-time follow-up here. And then before Poby goes I have some FOMO stuff

2370
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:37,640
I want to talk to him about but bashful

2371
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:41,380
Yeah, I got it. I got it here. Which I got it. He's over there. He's over here

2372
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:45,200
well, I got to be careful how much I say but

2373
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:49,780
Long in the short of it is is that where I'm working right now?

2374
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:56,180
We actually have an agent a different that runs over the PCIe protocol that can leverage the GPUs natively

2375
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:02,120
For remote a whole want yep

2376
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:09,660
Yeah, well it's it's kind of on its way

2377
01:28:09,660 --> 01:28:17,480
Like our whole company runs remotely everything in our office is just either a laptop or what's called a zero client

2378
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:21,460
Interesting and so there's no

2379
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:27,040
So, I'm pretty sure it's fire when it comes you guys you guys are already hip to this notion

2380
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:29,840
Yeah, we've been well

2381
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:30,160
I mean

2382
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:33,440
That's what the company work for it was founded on and stuff like that

2383
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:40,000
And so for example Amazon workspaces their windows offering like that's our agent. Yeah, that's really hot guy and we actually

2384
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:45,560
This kind of stuff doing remote desktop terminal services stuff. It's interesting. It's still now. It's just getting hosted by larger companies

2385
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:52,320
Well, it's that and also a lot of people tend to look at it for now

2386
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:54,720
I almost equate it to application streaming

2387
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:59,120
So where a lot of our workloads are going is people bringing specific

2388
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:05,260
Applications over the net and it's a lot of like CAD and video editing and stuff like that. Basically everyone wants to leverage

2389
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:11,980
Remote resources and I was gonna I should have mentioned X to go also has support for publishing just a

2390
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:18,900
Just a single app. But yeah, so poppy I have to ask what's tell me you you are I

2391
01:29:19,340 --> 01:29:25,460
Believe you are preaching the Church of rust to everybody and I I feel like I'm totally left out

2392
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:29,140
I'm not I know rust is a game. I know there's something that's not just a programming language

2393
01:29:29,820 --> 01:29:31,820
but

2394
01:29:32,180 --> 01:29:36,760
Chase someone right now. Is it so it's like a game. Is it like an open-world game?

2395
01:29:37,820 --> 01:29:39,820
Yeah, it's a blow

2396
01:29:40,420 --> 01:29:42,420
Discord outed you that you were playing

2397
01:29:43,060 --> 01:29:49,180
Yeah, I'm playing at the moment and and it obviously works under Linux and I take it poppy. Oh, yeah

2398
01:29:49,180 --> 01:29:55,500
Can I ask how many penises you see in the past half hour? Penises

2399
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:57,340
That's pretty personal there. They're

2400
01:29:58,100 --> 01:30:02,180
Russ is notorious for having a lot of male genitalia

2401
01:30:02,780 --> 01:30:07,620
Swinging around. So is it like a is it like co-op environment? Is it self-hosted servers?

2402
01:30:07,660 --> 01:30:12,980
What is the is it a multiplayer at all poppy? Is it single-player? Yeah. Yeah, it's totally multiplayer

2403
01:30:12,980 --> 01:30:19,740
So it's a big open-world think minecraft but with the yeah, no wonder it's so big exactly

2404
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:22,460
It's it's hilarious

2405
01:30:23,540 --> 01:30:27,180
Sorry, I I'm playing it right now while we're talking and

2406
01:30:28,700 --> 01:30:37,020
So the premise is you arrive naked on an island and you have to run around and gather resources and

2407
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:45,860
Fortify your base because other people will come along and kill you. Oh, no, we'll kill you. So, how do you know like

2408
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:49,380
How do you know you can't you can you build your own server?

2409
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:53,700
Like can you run your own system? So you could just have your own world where people won't kill you. Yeah

2410
01:30:53,700 --> 01:30:58,340
Yeah, you could do totally do that. I'm running on there. I'm I play mostly on the gaming on the next

2411
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:03,420
Server so Liam the guy. Yeah. Yep. I saw him tweeting about it. Yeah

2412
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:10,100
Yeah, he has his own server and we play on there, but there are other servers that are modded

2413
01:31:10,100 --> 01:31:12,100
there are some that are stock and some that are

2414
01:31:12,660 --> 01:31:18,980
Tweaked to be you know better faster different in some ways it hostile. Is it fun? Like is it?

2415
01:31:18,980 --> 01:31:23,100
Oh, it's it's generally shoot on sight. So if you see some

2416
01:31:23,820 --> 01:31:28,740
Naked person running in front of you you shoot them first and then run up to their body and steal their stuff

2417
01:31:28,740 --> 01:31:32,740
And if they turn out to be your friend, then you revive them

2418
01:31:32,740 --> 01:31:36,540
But it's generally shoot on sight. It's survival like just now

2419
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:45,220
yeah, just now when you were talking to be an aeroplane flew over and did an airdrop in air drops you on you find automatic weapons and

2420
01:31:45,220 --> 01:31:47,220
All kinds of other useful

2421
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:51,340
So if I join do I have any shot of making it before getting murdered at this point?

2422
01:31:51,340 --> 01:31:57,500
Is there just too many people? So the interesting thing is the servers reset every month because it's currently an alpha

2423
01:31:57,500 --> 01:32:03,940
any server you join pretty much any of this the stock servers will wipe and

2424
01:32:05,940 --> 01:32:10,700
So if you join soon after the wipe you're in with a bit of a chance if you joined

2425
01:32:11,380 --> 01:32:12,860
now

2426
01:32:12,860 --> 01:32:16,500
Like a few days or a week before the server wipes

2427
01:32:16,740 --> 01:32:20,700
Then chances are everyone else has automatic weapons and you arrive as a naked

2428
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:28,220
And the interesting thing about these kind of games and I believe rust is one of them is if you log off your body stays

2429
01:32:28,220 --> 01:32:31,660
In the world so you can go and find somebody that's like laying around just steal their stuff

2430
01:32:32,820 --> 01:32:39,740
Yes, so this is why you fortify your your place and you build a house in which you're protected

2431
01:32:39,740 --> 01:32:44,020
So when you exit the game your body is left in a place where nobody can get you

2432
01:32:44,020 --> 01:32:50,020
But people could build c4 and explode the walls bust through wall steal your stuff

2433
01:32:50,020 --> 01:32:52,020
so yeah, so um

2434
01:32:52,380 --> 01:32:57,900
So that must be like some sort of mad rush for resources and territory when the server is actually yeah

2435
01:32:58,060 --> 01:33:02,180
Yeah, that sounds really stressful and then just a constant war until the reset

2436
01:33:02,180 --> 01:33:05,160
But it also sounds really fun. If I was good at it, it would be fun

2437
01:33:05,180 --> 01:33:08,100
But until I was hilarious, you don't even have to be good

2438
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:15,140
I I have I have shared some space with wimpy me and him have a little compound

2439
01:33:15,140 --> 01:33:21,740
It's adorable have high high walls around it with an automatic door and automatic turrets

2440
01:33:21,740 --> 01:33:25,140
So if anyone busted through the door, they get shot as soon as they come through the door

2441
01:33:25,820 --> 01:33:32,360
And all kinds of other like ways in which to protect our stuff. It's the alliance all ephemeral anyway

2442
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:33,820
Yeah, it sounds fun though

2443
01:33:33,820 --> 01:33:39,340
Cuz it's in a week in a week or so this is all gonna get thrown away and we all start again as nakeds on

2444
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:44,020
The beach so yeah, it's good fun. Yes. There's really kind of profound in a lot of ways actually

2445
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:50,180
Yeah, is what it is. It's like a society if what would happen if society completely collapsed. This is what we'd have

2446
01:33:50,180 --> 01:33:57,400
Yeah, that's the weird thing. We have we've built up knowing that they're so when you know that the server wipe is coming

2447
01:33:59,420 --> 01:34:03,040
When it gets close to the server wipe nobody cares about anything because you know

2448
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:14,580
You're all gonna get wiped out in a week. So everyone just goes attacking everyone even people you had as friends

2449
01:34:14,580 --> 01:34:17,300
Oh, what does this say about humanity? What does this say?

2450
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:23,940
you start building up a stockpile of food and weapons and armor and clothes and

2451
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:31,620
You know the resources you need to survive the apocalypse. It's brilliant. That's pretty great. All right. I just bought it on humble bundle

2452
01:34:31,620 --> 01:34:36,380
I'm gonna give it a go. I gotta try it. I gotta try it. Okay server. What do you guys say?

2453
01:34:36,380 --> 01:35:01,300
You know gentoo challenge next week for Halloween
