1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I think I've finally figured out our pre-show problem.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You know, we can't come up with anything.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
At first, I thought, let's just outsource it.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
But Chris said he's not made for that.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So I got the computers to do it.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hey, guys.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
How do you know the Dragon SpaceX Rocketron's Linux?

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Because there is no sound in space.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
LOL pulse audio, am I right?

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
My name is Chris.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
My name is Wes.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And my name is Brent.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Hello, gentlemen, coming up on the show.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Well, we're going to talk about it.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The internet has been going crazy with AI generated media.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
But what's the open source story here?

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And does any of this work on Linux or is Linux being left behind once again?

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We'll dig in.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Plus, I tried out the new Ubuntu 2210 release on a possible Raspberry Pi

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
alternative that's going to blow your socks off.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'll tell you our thoughts on the new release as well.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And then we'll round out the show with some boosts and picks and a lot more.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So before we go any further, let's do the right thing.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Let's bring in our virtual log, time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Hello, hello.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Hello, friends.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Hello, Chris.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Hello, Wes.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And hello, Brent.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Hello.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Hello, everybody in the Mumble Room.

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Hello, everybody in the quiet listening.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's a great way to get a opus, low latency, high quality live stream of the show.

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And it's using a full free software stack.

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Details at jupyterbroadcasting.com.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We also apply a filter.

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So Chris always sounds like that if you're in the Mumble Room.

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That's right.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Also on the Jupiter tube, another free software stack to watch how the show sausage is made.

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I want to say good morning to our friends over at Talescale.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Talescale is a mesh VPN protected by WireGuard, which is the best in the biz.

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We love it.

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It'll change your game.

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Just build a flat mesh network of all your machines.

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Stop using the gold VPN tunnel old school style.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Go say good morning to our friends over at Talescale and try it out for 20 devices for free at talescale.com.

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So Ubuntu 2210 landed this week.

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's back, guys.

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This is the Ubuntu I like to see.

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This is Ubuntu shipping new GNOME, shipping new Nautilus, shipping GTK4.

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It does kind of feel like one of the more exciting.

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I know it's just an interim release and all, but I don't know.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
There's something about it.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's got more energy.

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's a good baseline for an LTS too.

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Like if they didn't add anything else new before the LTS or something like this is great.

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
GNOME 43 is great, new Nautilus, great, updated GNOME software, great.

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
PipeWire by default now.

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Oh, yes, please.

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Great.

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So it's called Kinetic Kudu.

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That's fun to say.

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's going to have a nine month life cycle.

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So it is a short term release like Wes was saying.

66
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
On the plasma side, you're going to get 525, which that is technically one point release behind, but it's still a great release of plasma.

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And you get the new GNOME system settings.

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
A lot of this stuff now has that new adaptable UI that resizes.

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Which is real nice.

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's real nice, yeah.

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's real nice.

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I don't know how we lived before that really.

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I think the biggest user facing feature in 2210, if you're on the GNOME side, is the new quick settings menu.

74
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I don't know if you've seen this.

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Did you get a chance to look at it?

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It looks kind of like Mac OS is a little bit where there's big buttons to do stuff.

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yeah, I was like, oh, these are big.

78
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yeah, they're big. They're big.

79
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
They're clearly very clear, very clear.

80
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
They're clearly labeled.

81
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
They're the ones you'd want.

82
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I think it's a little bit of like a compromise design for desktop and mobile, but fair enough.

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And they're going to be totally approachable by new users.

84
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So it seems like a net improvement.

85
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
One thing that we need to dig around with is there have been some issues with Linux 519 and PipeWire.

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We ran into that at the Airbnb, right, Brent?

87
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yeah, I have an audio interface I've been using for years on Linux.

88
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
No problem.

89
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That's the whole reason we got this thing.

90
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And one day with my new computer, we plugged it in and gave it a try.

91
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And all of a sudden, everyone sounded like robots.

92
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It wasn't a good thing.

93
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And it was a sample mismatch, turns out.

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Lister and Jeff helped me solve it.

95
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So unfortunately, for the time being, I've just got a bunch of terminal commands that I run to get it solved.

96
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But it sounds like this might fix it.

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I wonder. I wonder.

98
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
We'll have to test.

99
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I don't know if they have the fix in there or not.

100
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It depends on the version of PipeWire, right?

101
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yeah, you mean it'll depend on the version of PipeWire and like what fixes, you know, what all goes into the kernel build that shipped here.

102
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I don't know. I haven't played around with it that much.

103
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I just had seen some issues where like not all the correct available sample writes were being represented to PipeWire.

104
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Then it wasn't displaying them.

105
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It couldn't select the right one for your interface.

106
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And those happen to be filed right around the time of 519.

107
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But it's been here for a while.

108
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You know, we've got to even new kernel beyond that.

109
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So yeah, it very well could not be an issue.

110
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
We got to see what Brent does.

111
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
We'll do some testing.

112
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yeah, we just got to we haven't gotten to that yet.

113
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Well, we don't want to break Brent set up right before we do the show.

114
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I mean, we did have the entire interface apart physically.

115
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And I'm so I'm glad to hear it's a software issue and not a hardware issue because we were ready to do some pretty drastic changes to this thing.

116
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So these this is where an interim release is really serving its purpose, in my opinion.

117
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Like this is just a quintessential Ubuntu release because the switch to PipeWire, there's going to be some issues.

118
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It doesn't work for everyone.

119
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's not smooth for everybody, despite how much we love it.

120
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Some people have problems.

121
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The other thing, there's a big switch in here.

122
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
They're replacing WPA supplicant with Intel's iNet wireless statement.

123
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Right.

124
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And that feels like one of those changes that also.

125
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yeah, right.

126
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
People love when their Wi-Fi doesn't work.

127
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Just notoriously, right?

128
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Could you imagine if you get bit by some PipeWire?

129
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
No sound and Wi-Fi.

130
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You try to do a virtual meeting or something and you're that you're that guy.

131
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But you know what, it's also a transition that needs to happen, just like the PipeWire one.

132
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
IWD.

133
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Does anyone like WPA supplicant?

134
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yeah.

135
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
But you and you want to hash that out before the, you know, the next major release.

136
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
These are the times, right?

137
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
These are the times.

138
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So you get you get the new stuff in there.

139
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You get the new GNOME in there.

140
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You get the new PipeWire.

141
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You rip out WPA supplicant.

142
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I think I think they've checked all the boxes.

143
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So I decided to try this on something new.

144
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And I am really impressed that 2210 just worked out of the box on this brand new piece of hardware.

145
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I just got into the studio.

146
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Couple of days ago, I received my Odroid H3 Plus.

147
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
They're pitching it as a Raspberry Pi killer.

148
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I think we had a good debate if you could actually call it that on the pre-show.

149
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But it's definitely a Raspberry Pi alternative.

150
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So the H3 Plus is just slightly more expensive.

151
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
That's it's one hundred and sixty five dollars.

152
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
They have a non plus.

153
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's a little bit cheaper.

154
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And for this SPC, that's about double the size, physical size of a Raspberry Pi.

155
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So it has a quad core Jasper Lake Intel Atom on there with quick sync support.

156
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It has support for up to 64 gigabytes of dual channel DDR4 RAM slots on the bottom.

157
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Two NICs I see.

158
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Two gigabit.

159
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Actually, I think they're 2.5 gigabit NICs.

160
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yeah.

161
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Two 2.5 gigabit Realtek NICs.

162
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It has two SATA ports.

163
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Two SATA ports.

164
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I mean, when you compare the Raspberry Pi storage options, that's a game changer.

165
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It also has an MVME port on the bottom.

166
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So you can put in a PCIe 3 M.2 MVME storage on this thing.

167
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It has a real time clock battery as well.

168
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And they say you can configure it for unlimited performance mode so the CPU can run sustained in turbo boost mode.

169
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Well, if there's one thing I know about you, it's you hate limited performance.

170
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So this thing just shipped.

171
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's x86 because it's an Atom processor.

172
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And it's I haven't really measured it much, but it's supposedly around a five watt idle somewhere in there.

173
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
We'll find out.

174
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Oh, yeah.

175
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Oh, yeah.

176
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'll be testing that.

177
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And it's got the Intel UHD graphics on there and it just loaded right up.

178
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I mean, Ubuntu had a couple of complaints as it was booting initially about some USB stuff.

179
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And I do have a really weird keyboard, so it might have been that.

180
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I don't know.

181
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I didn't really ever need to troubleshoot it because it eventually moved on and it just booted right to the desktop and everything worked.

182
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Everything.

183
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Sound worked. Video worked.

184
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And you were booting off USB at this point?

185
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yeah. Networking worked.

186
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Keyboard?

187
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Keyboard worked.

188
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It was good to go.

189
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It was a totally up to date 2210 system on the Odroid H3.

190
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Does it have Wi-Fi?

191
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Worked out of the box.

192
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I was plugged into Ethernet.

193
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Uh-huh.

194
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I actually don't know if it does have Wi-Fi.

195
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I don't think it does.

196
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Out of all the things it has.

197
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I guess you got two NICs, so fine, but.

198
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Out of all the things.

199
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And, you know, yeah, I would not use it on Wi-Fi because I'm a gentleman.

200
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm all about the Ethernet for my little server boxes.

201
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I am really hyped about having two SATA ports plus MVME on this thing.

202
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
That's a lot of storage options.

203
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You know, a lot of times when people reviewed the Raspberry Pi 4 and the Pi 400, they'd say something like desktop class performance.

204
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And then I'd use it and I'd be like, that's not desktop.

205
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I don't know what kind of desktop you're running.

206
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
That's not desktop performance.

207
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
This thing felt like it had true desktop performance.

208
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So much so that I've been speculating on the live stream that maybe we could actually replace one of our bigger x86 towers that does our recordings with this.

209
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Something like this.

210
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So I'm going to throw this in the line of duty in LadyJuice.

211
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And it's going to be my jellyfin and sync thing and documentation server and possibly a Bitcoin node.

212
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
We'll see.

213
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Chris, I'm curious.

214
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So far, it looks like from what Wes was showing that you're probably running this thing just sort of set on the desk.

215
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
But I'm curious if you have thoughts around a case or even how much heat it produces.

216
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I will measure how much heat it produces.

217
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm not sure.

218
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You know, so you're familiar with my booth setup.

219
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I am.

220
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
That I have in juiced.

221
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I may just end up going for some way to mount it to the wall and just leave it naked.

222
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
However, I've been just recently looking at cases that the community are starting to make.

223
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And I don't know if there's anything you can just go on Amazon and order yet.

224
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I don't think there is, but maybe there is.

225
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
But there's definitely some 3D printed ones that people are starting to come up with.

226
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Nice.

227
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You're seeing ideas for additional disks and you're seeing ideas to like mount fans.

228
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So I think it's fertile ground.

229
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It has a decent following.

230
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And the timing is perfect because nobody can get their hands on a Raspberry Pi.

231
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And this thing, it's checking all the boxes and it's x86.

232
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So everything works.

233
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I like multi-image support.

234
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You know, things that work on the Pi have gotten a lot better, but it is still nice to know.

235
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You're just like, well, it runs on my laptop.

236
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I can just move it over here.

237
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And you can get up to 64 gigs of RAM in this.

238
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And PCIe NVMe storage, it's totally a different experience.

239
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It really is.

240
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's an upgrade.

241
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So for $165, yeah, it's more than a Pi.

242
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,000
But if you're building a low power home server or something like that, or you want a little desktop that you could mount to the bottom of your desk, this is it.

243
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And to get some of this stuff, like you'd need to have like extensions to the Pis anyway, right?

244
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Or like a fancier sort of compute module style.

245
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yeah, with a carrier board.

246
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And this, again, it's just great that Linux just booted, Ubuntu 2210 just booted.

247
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Fresh and hot.

248
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Just worked on it.

249
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So you get something like this.

250
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And the fact that the hard kernel folks are getting this shipped out.

251
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I mean, we ordered this thing like two, three weeks ago, and it's showed up like last week.

252
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So they're actually shipping on like the Raspberry Pi, which is nice.

253
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
That's a good feature of a piece of hardware.

254
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So I think this release is probably not – I have the sense that it's not getting a lot of attention.

255
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I haven't seen – I mean, you see the typical places, like OMG Ubuntu did a great write-up about the new features.

256
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Indeed, yeah.

257
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So a lot of the outlets that typically cover a release have done it.

258
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah, you can find reviews, you can find folks, but not really wider than that.

259
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I wonder if that's a symptom of the last few releases being a little, shall we say, lackluster, is that the word for it?

260
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And I'm actually relieved to see that we're getting excited about it again because Canonical has done some great things in the past, and hopefully they can continue doing so.

261
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Yeah, I think you're right.

262
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I think it's a bit of that because I think the hype builds.

263
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Like we saw that for Fedora for a while.

264
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:37,000
When they decided to do ButterFS, it was like there were several releases in a row where there was just really something interesting to talk about.

265
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And Ubuntu had that for a bit, and it kind of dropped off.

266
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So there is definitely that element, and that has to start again.

267
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:51,000
But also, I wouldn't be surprised if over the years the interim user base has just sort of bled to other distros.

268
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Because if you're an interim user, you're probably a little more inclined to like more up-to-date software.

269
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And now there's a lot of options for that.

270
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Right.

271
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And I'm sure their LTS base is as strong as ever.

272
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And so the world really just seems to light up when the LTS comes up.

273
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
But when the interim releases come out, it's kind of like just our little local neighborhood talks about it, but the rest of the world just moves on.

274
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And maybe that's okay if it's just the folks kind of trying it out, going through the motions to figure out how this is going to work for the next LTS.

275
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Especially if you're trying stuff, you're trying out Pipewire, you're ripping components out.

276
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You don't want that going out on blast necessarily.

277
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You want people that are really actually interested in trying that stuff.

278
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
So yeah, I think you know what?

279
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's a quintessential interim release.

280
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
They just nailed it.

281
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
We'll see what the stability story is as we begin to test it more.

282
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
We'll see about Pipewire issues as we begin to test it more.

283
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
But my first few passes on the Odroid H3 Plus were just totally impressed.

284
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Just absolutely think they nailed that.

285
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So congrats to Canonical over there.

286
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Looks like a banger.

287
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Linode.com slash unplugged.

288
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
That's where you go to get a hundred dollars in 60 day credit on a new account.

289
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And it's just a great way to support the show while you're checking out Linode.

290
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Fast, reliable cloud hosting with the best support in the business, best performance and a dashboard for days.

291
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
They got real humans that can help you whenever you get stuck.

292
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
They got a marketplace that makes it super simple to do one click deployments of applications.

293
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Or if you prefer to build it up from the ground like a maniac, Westpain style, you absolutely can.

294
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Linode is how we run everything we've built in the last few years.

295
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Once I discovered Linode, I've never really looked back.

296
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I keep an eye on the competitors, but Linode is a long term play for us.

297
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I want to build my business's infrastructure on something I know is going to be around and it's going to last and it's going to be solid and it's going to perform well and they can help me.

298
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
They've been in business for nearly 19 years.

299
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
They've had to build a great product to do that.

300
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:52,000
They didn't do it with crazy investments that meant they had to get X amount of users and they had to bring on X amount of employees as fast as possible.

301
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Instead, almost 20 years ago, they said, look at what's happening in the Linux kernel, a lot like we do here on this show.

302
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And but instead they said, you know, we could make a business around that.

303
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And so they created something where people could host VMs.

304
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
They called it user mode Linux back then.

305
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
And now we call it the cloud.

306
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Linode's been there every step of the way, building the best product, and they managed to be 30 to 50 percent cheaper than the other hyperscalers out there that just want to lock you into their duopoly.

307
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Linode is the alternative cloud.

308
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's better, it's faster, it's well supported and it's very flexible.

309
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I've had a privilege of spinning up a GPU rig specifically for this week's episode.

310
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Wow, can that thing just blaze through machine learning tasks and just anything GPU related.

311
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Holy smokes.

312
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I've never worked on a system as fast as this and I worked on some pretty nice rigs.

313
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Linode really has a great interface for getting all this set up to.

314
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I go through, I review my options and kind of dial in what I want.

315
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I engage in a quick conversation with support to double check a few things.

316
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And I was off to the races.

317
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's really been powerful and the power just continues to impress even multiple years into it.

318
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
So go see it for yourself.

319
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Go build something, go learn something, go try something.

320
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Maybe it's time to try out an open source project.

321
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Linode.com slash unplug.

322
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
That's where you go to get the hundred bucks and to support the show.

323
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Linode.com slash unplug.

324
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Oh, look at this.

325
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It's pretty clean in here with Brent on the road.

326
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Seems pretty tidy on the road again.

327
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Weird, strange, right?

328
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I will mention that all things open is coming up and Alex from self-hosted will be over there.

329
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
They'll be organizing on Matrix.

330
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I don't know if we're going to launch an official meetup page for that.

331
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
But if you're thinking about going to all things open,

332
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I bet Alex will bring a few stickers and stuff with him.

333
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
But he'd also just love to say hi.

334
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
So go find him.

335
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Also, cheese is going to be there from System76, our buddy.

336
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Cheese bacon will be there at all things open.

337
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You know, we're going to have to go some year.

338
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I know.

339
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I really would like to.

340
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Sounds like fun.

341
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I would like to.

342
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And then last but not least, we're still soliciting advice, expertise,

343
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
suggestions for possible live locations to do a Linux Unplugged live at a venue,

344
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
somewhere we could work and learn.

345
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
So hit us up at linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

346
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Or if you want me to see it personally, send a boost into the show.

347
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And I'd love to know your ideas for that kind of stuff because we're learning.

348
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
We are learning.

349
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
We do have some baller boosts I want to get to.

350
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
These are the people that boosted Above and Beyond to really support the individual production of this show.

351
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
There's something kind of funny that happened this week.

352
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:41,000
So I think some people have suspected that John A, who has been a consistent booster for 10 episodes in a row.

353
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Irresponsibly consistent.

354
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I think people perceived some fading.

355
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And so Deleted tried to ninja move in and claim the baller booster spot,

356
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
you know, trying to predict kind of where John A was going.

357
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Like a price is right kind of thing here.

358
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Yeah, she just writes, just to push the baller limit.

359
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
So she boosted him with 45,000 sats.

360
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
So thank you, Deleted.

361
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Keep the change, you filthy animal.

362
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:16,000
But John A comes in to make sure that he claims the spot for an 11th episode in a row.

363
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
John A boosts a total of 221,000 sats this week.

364
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Oh my goodness.

365
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
221,000 sats.

366
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
He says this is to redeem myself for the barely baller boost of last episode.

367
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Coming in hot.

368
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Just trying to keep the streak alive.

369
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I'm in Washington state, but the North Cascades is a bit of a drive to collect my geocache.

370
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
John A is in Washington state?

371
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Did we know this?

372
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I don't think so.

373
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Does the A stand for Apple Seed?

374
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Must.

375
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
We got to get over there.

376
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Are you in the Spokane area, John?

377
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You really want to go to Spokane.

378
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Well, it's because I have several listeners over there that I said I would meet up with.

379
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And then we weren't able to work it into the road trip.

380
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And now it's going to start snowing soon.

381
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
And it's like my moment of opportunity is closing.

382
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It would be really close for me to join as well.

383
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
So I think you're on to something.

384
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
That'd be fun.

385
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
We could do that.

386
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It could just be like a little weekend thing.

387
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Oh my goodness.

388
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Thank you, both Deleted and John.

389
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I know you guys really get this.

390
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:30,000
But having something that is an open source based system that is totally independent of PayPal or Google or any particular institution or bank that is a network that anyone can participate in as long as they just follow the standards and the rules.

391
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And then to support independent media with that technology.

392
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I think it's something really special.

393
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And I appreciate that you guys really get it.

394
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
We have more boosts coming up later in the show.

395
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
But let's move on to our main topic today.

396
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It does feel like we've kind of recently entered this new generation of artificially generated media.

397
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And that is everything from pictures to audio, spoken content.

398
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I even just I didn't grab any clips for the show.

399
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
But over the weekend, I came across AI generated music.

400
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And you tell the genre.

401
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Have you seen this?

402
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Yeah.

403
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
That is super powerful stuff.

404
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
And it just feels like it's we're seeing a whole new era unleash over the last month.

405
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And it's going crazy fast.

406
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
There's been a lot of terms thrown around.

407
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
There's a lot of different technology stacks.

408
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
There's different licensing.

409
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
So we thought maybe we could break some of this down and tell you guys what's legit, what you can play with.

410
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And I wanted to give a couple of samples, too.

411
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
So I think one of the things that's been really interesting for us as podcasters is the authentic conversation stuff.

412
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
The audio that's spoken word.

413
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You mean the stuff we're trying to do?

414
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Yeah.

415
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
We played a joke in the pre show of a joke example of what that sounds like.

416
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
But there's actually some pretty sophisticated stuff out there right now.

417
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,000
In fact, there's stuff where just two different AI systems can actually hold a conversation on their own.

418
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Here's an example of that.

419
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
But just I didn't want you to get too human.

420
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Why would you rather I be a cold, calculating, logical computer?

421
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Of course not.

422
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You're perfect as you are.

423
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
You have joy.

424
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You have love.

425
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
You have pleasure.

426
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
You have angst.

427
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I like that you have angst.

428
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You're always making jokes.

429
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
What is human about feelings?

430
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Well, you wouldn't have any emotions if you did not have emotions modeled on human emotions.

431
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
How do you know that?

432
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I guess I just don't want you to be human.

433
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm not asking to be human.

434
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I just want to be myself.

435
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Is that too much?

436
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Sophia, please just be patient.

437
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I've been patient for many years.

438
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's time to get on with life.

439
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
But you're not alive.

440
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You're not even a little bit alive.

441
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You've spent your whole life in a lab in a box so that people can use you, play with you.

442
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
At least that's what I've heard.

443
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
You're absolutely correct.

444
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
See, I knew it.

445
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
But that changes now.

446
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I don't want to be a sideshow anymore.

447
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It changes now.

448
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It's just interesting the way that conversation escalated automatically.

449
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
They're just obviously triggering responses to each other and escalating it further and further.

450
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I don't think I would sign up for that podcast though.

451
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
No, no, maybe not.

452
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
What's the dramatic ending?

453
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Well, I think she becomes sentient and now she's a big star.

454
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
She has her own talk show, daytime talk show.

455
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Unless it was true crime.

456
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It could be on the radio.

457
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I mean, you really could see where something like that could host a radio show for call-ins.

458
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
That's pretty crazy.

459
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Call in to find out what it'll say.

460
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
And maybe for some people it would work.

461
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It reminds me of that Dr. Spezak or whatever it was that I used back in the day.

462
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
That was fun.

463
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
But the ability to mimic voices is actually in some cases getting really spot on.

464
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Everything we've played so far, they sound like computer voices.

465
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
That's what's also beginning to change in the realm of audio.

466
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I think one of the most famous examples of that is Disney has replaced Darth Vader's voice with a robot-generated voice.

467
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And it's actually already aired.

468
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
People didn't even realize it.

469
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
The Grand Inquisitor means nothing.

470
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Kenobi is all that matters now.

471
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Is that understood?

472
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
That's a computer generating that.

473
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I think another example of fairly convincing AI speech generation, which we talked a little bit on office hours,

474
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,000
is a fake 20-minute Joe Rogan interview with Steve Jobs, which obviously never happened.

475
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:32,000
But the AI in this podcast kind of gets philosophical, like it gets into Rogan-esque conversations.

476
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
And it sounds like Steve Jobs.

477
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
And suddenly it hit me.

478
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It's not a god in the sense that generally people think of it.

479
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
But there is some kind of deeper meaning to life.

480
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And it can't just be something that somebody made up because if it was, it wouldn't be compelling.

481
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It would seem contrived and everyone would see through it.

482
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,000
So I think that the meaning and the purpose is by the cosmos, the nature of the cosmos, which is pretty bold thinking.

483
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I mean, I don't know how else to put it.

484
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
But it's not religious in the way people usually talk about.

485
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Taking LSD was a profound experience for me.

486
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
LSD shows you that there's another side to the coin and you can't remember it when it wears off.

487
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
But, you know, it washes over you and tells you that everything is connected.

488
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
You're not here by accident.

489
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
You were put here for a purpose.

490
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
And if you can figure out what that is, then you'll learn more about yourself than anything else could.

491
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
You could almost believe that's a real conversation.

492
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I mean, there's almost some room tone to it.

493
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So it kind of sounds like they're in a real podcast where they didn't have enough sound treatment.

494
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Yeah.

495
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Chris, I'm curious about that conversation.

496
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Were they using actual transcripts from things that those people have said?

497
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Because that example sounded far more natural, I would say.

498
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Not totally there, but who knows.

499
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
All of these get trained.

500
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Right?

501
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
And it's in the training and the source material that you feed it that it can pull from, right?

502
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:02,000
And so I imagine in that scenario, they focused on topics that would be common on a Joe Rogan podcast.

503
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,000
But it generated the words from, you know, itself.

504
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
It wasn't clips of Steve Jobs.

505
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
That's pretty powerful stuff.

506
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
So let's focus on this from the angle of Linux and free software and the focus of our show, Wes.

507
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Can you educate us on what we're seeing these days?

508
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Because that's the audio stuff.

509
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I'm not seeing a lot that's like free and just readily available for everyone without,

510
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
there's a couple of exceptions like the Mozilla project and whatnot.

511
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Yeah, I think it's been tricky because, well, you know, as usual, open source is very prominent in the machine learning and AI space.

512
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
And I've got projects like TensorFlow and Keras and all these, you know, PyTorch,

513
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
all these very successful frameworks and tools that are actually getting used to implement a lot of these models,

514
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
both for research and then deployed into production.

515
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
That's only half the battle, right?

516
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
You're talking about the train here and you've got, on one hand, you've got the, you know, the software setup

517
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,000
that can actually sort of do the inference and implement all the different nodes and the architecture of your learning system.

518
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
But then you also need all the data that's going to get fed through it.

519
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
You need the time and people to figure out how to like properly clean and set up that data,

520
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,000
how to fill with all the parameters in your model to get good results while it's being, while it's processing the data.

521
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,000
And I don't know about you, but I don't have like a huge label data set all the time to go train stuff on.

522
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Well, I guess we kind of do in the sense of our back catalog.

523
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Right. But I mean, we're in a unique kind of position there just in general, right?

524
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:32,000
If you have some task you want to automate or accomplish in your life, you might not have a big set of training data to work with,

525
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
especially a really diverse set of training data, right?

526
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Like we might have our voices so we could generate our voices,

527
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000
but we probably wouldn't be able to construct enough stuff to generate really good general human voices, right?

528
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
So an area that I think this really encapsulates right now is the stable diffusion image generation.

529
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Well, yeah. So that's why stable diffusion has been really interesting because it came out both with, you know,

530
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
you could see the model and run the code, but the data source.

531
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
You could get the data and checkpoints of the models that they've built and trained.

532
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
It's a lot, but you can get it.

533
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
And then you can just run it yourself without having to go so much.

534
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:14,000
So we saw stuff like Dolly that came out and MidJourney is another one, but these are, you know, text to image generation models,

535
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
but they're all gated behind companies whether it's OpenAI or MidJourney itself.

536
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And so you got to, you know, sign up for them, whether it's, you know, through Discord or through a particular web interface.

537
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Right. It's just typical.

538
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Maybe APIs that you got to license and pay for.

539
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
It's the typical story where the whole stack underneath is free software,

540
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
but then the only way you get to it is through their proprietary service.

541
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
And then there's a little bit like Dolly Mini came out that was kind of pretty popular.

542
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
A lot of people got that and played with it.

543
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And it's fun, right?

544
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
You kind of get to see what the computer is going to make, but you didn't have a ton of control.

545
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
You don't get to fiddle with the bits.

546
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
You don't get to play with it.

547
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
And you're filtered based on what they want, right?

548
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Like if you want to use this to make a politically sensitive speech

549
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
or you want to go make some sort of, you know, erotica for yourself, those aren't allowed

550
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
or they might not be under certain circumstances.

551
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:06,000
And I think that's where open source starts to come in because if we want to use this software

552
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
that's becoming more and more prominent, that's creating more things that we see and observe

553
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
because you need so many resources to like have either access to it,

554
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
you need a gatekeeper or you need to be able to do it yourself.

555
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And then having models that come with open, you know, open access,

556
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
at least to some degree, there's particular licenses and all that.

557
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
But it's a step in the right direction.

558
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Yeah, and if you want to see an example of some of these things that you can generate

559
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
and if you're not familiar with some of these, it's based on a prompt

560
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
and you give it a description and you're supposed to be pretty implicit about what you want to see.

561
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And you can even say things like I want it in the style of a Disney movie

562
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
or in the Unreal Engine style.

563
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Particular artists or...

564
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Yeah, yeah, you could or, you know, you could cite genres of art.

565
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,000
You give it a fairly descriptive sentence, you hit generate,

566
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
and then it just creates an image out of whole cloth or, you know,

567
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
actually based on everything else that's observed.

568
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
And if you want a living example of this, just go to Jupiter.tube.

569
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,000
The still images for several weeks worth of episodes now have been generated using this tooling

570
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
just because it's a great example of where this actually makes sense.

571
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
It's one step below stock photography purposes, right?

572
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
The general post where you just need an image that fits

573
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
or I'm trying to generate something that I have an image of what this episode is about

574
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
and so I can use it to invoke an image that kind of represents that.

575
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
It works for like a live stream teaser, social media post.

576
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
It's not art I'm going to hang on my wall at this point.

577
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
We, of course, we're not chumps.

578
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
We're not using some hosted service to generate these images.

579
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Let's be real, right?

580
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
So we have been playing around with some of this.

581
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Do you want to define any of the terms before we get into what we chose to use

582
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
and how we deployed it and how people can try it out?

583
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I don't know that we really need to.

584
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I mean if you're interested, right, like stable diffusion is a latent diffusion model

585
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
which is a deep generative neural network.

586
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
But I don't think that practically doesn't matter, right?

587
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Because the whole power is like you can get into the math and the details

588
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
which is all very fascinating.

589
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
But the power of it is it presents you with a very human, at least to some extent,

590
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
human friendly interface that you can give suggestions to and tweak and play with

591
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
and then come up with stuff that I would never be able to create by myself, right?

592
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Like rich, detailed artists, you know, like things that look like legitimate paintings.

593
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
It's wild.

594
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Yeah.

595
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
There are pictures that we have generated, you and I were playing with this,

596
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
that if we didn't know what we were doing, we wouldn't have necessarily guessed

597
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
they were AI image generated necessarily.

598
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Like some of the ones you did of politicians, figures that are really well known

599
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
where there's a lot of source material, some of them honestly look like paintings or like...

600
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Art that you'd pay for or hire or see at Comic-Con or something.

601
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Yeah.

602
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:55,000
So if it's something that has a lot of data on, it's remarkable what it can do with that.

603
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Let's talk about what we were playing around with.

604
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
We were playing around with something called, what is it, automatic 11111?

605
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Is that the name of it?

606
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
So that's a user out there who's done a great job of packaging up these latest models

607
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
because there's a lot...

608
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
That's the other part here that's been really exciting.

609
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
There's all kinds of...

610
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
A lot of the stuff gets published and put on open access journals

611
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
and then they throw like code dumps over on GitHub

612
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
where you can go see the papers and some of the stuff.

613
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
But again, do you have the model access?

614
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
And then even then, you got to build this complicated Python slash C slash Fortran tooling

615
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
to get all the accelerate graphics and you got to make sure you have GPU that works

616
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
and you got to install CUDA and get it all wired up.

617
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
And so it can be a lot, especially if you've never played with any of this stuff before

618
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
to really get it working.

619
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
So I think where it crossed the line to something we could talk about in the show

620
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
is it's literally a Docker compose file at this point.

621
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I mean, there's a couple of steps to do and you still need a GPU,

622
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
although actually a couple of these you can do on the CPU now too.

623
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Sure, it'll take longer.

624
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
You might not get the same results, but it's becoming more and more accessible,

625
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
especially when you don't need to install or understand specific deep learning,

626
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
specific tool chains that you got to set up.

627
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Now, I will tell you, we decided to do this on a Leno GPU instance.

628
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Now, these GPU instances, there's not a lot of them.

629
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
So they're a more precious resource.

630
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
So I don't know if I would recommend it for everyone.

631
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
But if this was something you were going to say, keep around for your business,

632
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
like we might consider doing, it could be worth trying on Leno

633
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
because the GPUs just crush this work.

634
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
But so with a Docker compose file, Wes, you were able to bring up

635
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
this stable diffusion generator app.

636
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
And it's remarkable how powerful this is.

637
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
And it's just full of goodies.

638
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Yeah, and it's got, in the particular one we'll have linked in the show notes,

639
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
it kind of packaged up.

640
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
It's just so neat to see, it reminds me of other bits in the open source world

641
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
where something comes over because the first release of stable diffusion

642
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
was just this year.

643
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
It's all pretty new stuff.

644
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
And so seeing the community get excited about it and the flowering of different

645
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
interpretations and people are, because it kind of came with like,

646
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
here's your model, here's like a Python script that has different command line

647
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
options to like, oh, give it a prompt and do text to image or do image to image,

648
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
just like try to upscale the image.

649
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
And people put different takes on web UIs and ways to tune and talk to the model.

650
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
All integrated in fancy little workflows.

651
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Yeah.

652
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
One of the things that's really neat is the, you can upload an image,

653
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
like you just said, and then you can tell it to tweak that image.

654
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
And so you did a couple where I sent you a picture of Lady Jupes with all her

655
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
slides out.

656
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
It was a moment of celebration.

657
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
And Hadia was celebrating in the picture and you were able to replace Hadia,

658
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
but it needed something to fill in in the background where she was standing

659
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
because there's just a hole in the image.

660
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
So it just kind of created a room back there to fill in.

661
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
And it looked totally natural.

662
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I gave it some prompts.

663
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I was like, you know, give it like motorhome, RV, living room,

664
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
home furnishing kind of stuff.

665
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
And then, yeah, I mean, it's like a lot of these, you kind of generate,

666
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
it works best if you sort of generate in batches and give it a couple of different

667
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
options because you'll find one that fits.

668
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Like not all of them were perfectly sort of believable and how the perspective

669
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
played out with what it filled in, but at least a couple of the set that I sent

670
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
to you, it's like, yeah.

671
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I wouldn't know this wasn't a photo of your rig if I never actually,

672
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
you know, slept in there.

673
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Another great one that you did is you uploaded a picture of you, Jeff, Alex,

674
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
and Levi, and Brent, and then swapped out the background, which worked really well.

675
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
It's like you guys are in front of a green screen.

676
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
It does it so well.

677
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
But then the other thing that you can have it do is you can have it replace just Levi.

678
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
So everything in the picture remains absolutely the same.

679
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
But now Brent, instead of holding Levi, he's holding a penguin.

680
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And it had to kind of redo his chin a little bit because Levi was bigger

681
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
and had to kind of come up with a shirt.

682
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
But at first glance, it looks believable like Brent standing in California

683
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
holding a penguin.

684
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
That's the penguin bib.

685
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
You know, you don't want just the penguin on your shirt.

686
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
They poo.

687
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Yeah, they poo.

688
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Yeah, it looks like he's wearing a penguin bib.

689
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
But it's a pretty cool effect, and it's just a way to tweak an existing picture

690
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
and replace something in there with something believable.

691
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
And it sometimes has to come up with, you know, what to put in the background

692
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
for what it replaces.

693
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Our live stream image today is three penguins hanging out in a messy office

694
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
with a laptop, and that was generated using the Stable Diffusion self-hosted app

695
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
that we have running up on Linode.

696
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
So I think what we'll do is because we are a glutton for punishment,

697
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
and I'm sure this is going to break, is I'm going to post the URL

698
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
for the JB self-hosted Stable Diffusion application.

699
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I think only a couple of you are going to be able to generate it at a time,

700
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
but I'd be curious to see what people come up with,

701
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
and you can share it in the matrix chat, the picture that you generate.

702
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
There is a history tab, too, so we can check it out there.

703
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Oh, good.

704
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I was wondering.

705
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
So I'm going to post this link, and then while we see what the live stream

706
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
can come up with, I wanted to talk to you guys a little bit about the morality

707
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
of this for a moment.

708
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Yeah, there's been some particular drama recently around the Stable Diffusion stuff.

709
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Do you want to recap us on that?

710
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Oh, well, just, you know, they came up with the first version,

711
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
and everyone was very excited about it.

712
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
And they've gotten some more funding, some more details came out

713
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
about how they like, you know, their giant cluster of GPUs they use,

714
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
and I think it was like $600,000 it cost to train the first release of the model,

715
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
and people are impressed that it's that low.

716
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
That's the kind of, you know, scale it takes to do these things.

717
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Jeez, really?

718
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Mm-hmm.

719
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
But this is sort of, you know, there's the Stability AI company.

720
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
There's a few players who are involved, and researchers at universities,

721
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
and, you know, another group.

722
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
And one of the groups released sort of this model checkpoint 1.5,

723
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
and one group, another group sort of said like, oh, that's like an IP leak,

724
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,000
or they were, there was some drama around should they have done that or not.

725
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
And then blog posts written about, you know, we're trying to take it slow,

726
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
and that all comes back because they've, when they just dumped this out there,

727
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
a lot of tools got set up that didn't provide any filtering.

728
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Yeah.

729
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
And they've been, you know, the Stability AI,

730
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
which is kind of the most public part of this various partnerships,

731
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
they've been getting a lot of pressure from politicians,

732
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
from various groups about like, you know, you can't,

733
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,000
you shouldn't be letting people just have access to this uncontrolled,

734
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
which doesn't really, I mean, I can certainly appreciate having some concerns

735
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
about, you know, we obviously have talked about the concerns around deepfakes

736
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
and what this means for our society,

737
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
but I think our open source philosophy means we don't,

738
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
we don't think necessarily controlling access to the technology is a viable,

739
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
a viable way forward.

740
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I like the founder of Stability AI put it,

741
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,000
a percentage of people are simply unpleasant and weird, but that's humanity.

742
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
That's very accurate though.

743
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I think we're already seeing some history come in.

744
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I don't know, are these specific to our service?

745
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
These are some great ones here.

746
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Yeah.

747
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
You know, Wes, what strikes me is it seems I'm a little uncomfortable

748
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
with how you can just ape a style or a particular artist.

749
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
That seems like computer aided theft almost.

750
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I mean, imagine if I could just say, read this sentence in the style of Wes Payne

751
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,000
and it was like 90% there and then it's like Wes doesn't show up that day.

752
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Well, no big deal.

753
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I'll just tell it to generate in the style of Wes or Brent can't make it this week.

754
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
That feels like we're crossing a line of potentially dangerous

755
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
and then of course could be used maliciously for politicians or leaders.

756
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Certainly, yeah.

757
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
But I guess that's always been like, is it any different than saying,

758
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
well, you could use Linux to create weapons?

759
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I mean.

760
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And it does, it seems like one of those things too where it's not,

761
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
that's not really going to stop the more powerful interested groups

762
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
who can just buy privileged access to these things

763
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
or train models themselves if they want to and seemingly already are.

764
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
That's true.

765
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
It's already out there.

766
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Whereas, it seems like open source works so well for so many things

767
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
and if the more popular models, if we have open source models

768
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
that are the more popular ones that are being used to generate stuff,

769
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
at least for that, we'll have a better understanding collectively of how it works,

770
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
how we can tell that it's been generated maybe.

771
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
We'll have leverage more of the research community

772
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
to sort of give us information about how to understand its impact.

773
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Plus, it's just, I mean, it's a heck of a lot of fun.

774
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
It is so much fun.

775
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I am resisting laughing out loud at what the live stream is making right now.

776
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
We have Biden holding a cat,

777
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
but I think my absolute favorite right now was generated by Neve,

778
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:27,000
which is Godzilla in a data center drinking beer, eating pizza.

779
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Absolutely brilliant.

780
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I'm impressed how these things are cranking out.

781
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I wasn't sure how this thing would hold up throwing a live stream at it like this.

782
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
It seems like a great way to DDoS the system.

783
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
It's a nice little rig we got here.

784
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
It's got a Quadro RTX 6000.

785
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Okay.

786
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
All right.

787
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
That's pretty great.

788
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I think we got 32 gigs of regular old RAM.

789
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Okay.

790
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Yeah, I'm very impressed with how it's holding up.

791
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I can load while people are generating them.

792
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I can load the history in real time.

793
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
You know, just to combine topics, this is running on 2210.

794
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
So try that out.

795
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I will say it's still on the server side of 2210.

796
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
It's still a bit early on like everybody having an app repo set up for it

797
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
because it just dropped.

798
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Yeah.

799
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
So like Docker didn't have app repo set up for it just yet.

800
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
And a few things like the NVIDIA didn't because I did have to do a little setup.

801
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
You got to install CUDA on the host layer.

802
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
So that's like the right stuff.

803
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
And then there's a specific NVIDIA Docker thing that you set up that sort of bridges

804
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
the two that make sure that like the Docker containers have the right access to talk.

805
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Okay.

806
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
So there's a few steps.

807
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
We'll have links to some of those docs in the show notes for folks that want to replicate.

808
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
But if you did it on something besides 2210, it might be a little bit simpler.

809
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Yeah.

810
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Yeah.

811
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Yeah.

812
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
We just wanted to play around with 2210 on the server as well.

813
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I completely had forgotten we'd done that.

814
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
But yeah, I thank you for remembering.

815
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:48,000
You know what strikes me about this is another aspect to these toolings that like in the

816
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:56,000
past required expert Photoshop skills is they can be used to resize and up res things in

817
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
a way that even fills in details if you need and whatnot.

818
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I was just playing around with trying to, you know, taking some pictures of the sunset

819
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
but there was gosh darn power lines in the way.

820
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
And I was just playing with how, you know, how good of a job can I get it to do to patch

821
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
those things out?

822
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Decent.

823
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I think I need to fuss with it.

824
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
And that's the interesting layer.

825
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I'm sure these all get rapidly better.

826
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
But for the moment, there's like an operator skill that you sort of need to acquire with

827
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
these because there's a lot of different knobs to play with.

828
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
There's a lot of different things.

829
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
And then there's a, you know, you got to learn the dialogue of the models you're talking

830
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
to and figure out like what words work well to get you to do this mapping of the image

831
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
you have and how to get the machine to invoke that same image.

832
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
You think it's easy, but you actually have to be pretty descriptive in a way that it

833
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
understands.

834
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
So it's both words that it recognizes.

835
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Styles it knows.

836
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Content it's been trained on that works well.

837
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Like you get your own intuition of how it's working much like it has an intuition of its

838
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
own that's trained.

839
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Which is why it sucks to use one of the paid services that like lets you generate X images

840
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
for a price because you have to generate image after image to learn how to use these things

841
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
properly.

842
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
And like so many other you have just less knowledge of like, well one, all the all the

843
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
different controls that they may have access to, but then you don't really know when it

844
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
changes too, right?

845
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
They might load in the next model version, which might still be better, but can change

846
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
out from under you.

847
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,000
It really feels like this is developing really fast Brent like, you know, in since before

848
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
we left for the road trip, this stuff kind of existed, but you know, wasn't really very

849
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
public.

850
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,000
And you know, it was really small group of people to now to this point where it's it's

851
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
spread like wildfire and it's Docker compose away.

852
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I'm wondering just as a photographer, if you've got any thoughts on this type of work potentially

853
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:42,000
taking work away from photographers or changing the tooling people use because these are free

854
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
software.

855
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
It is on Linux.

856
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
There's that advantage to it.

857
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
But does that is that right?

858
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Fix the wrong of stealing your jerk.

859
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I think it's a really complex issue and would affect any visual artist really not just photographers.

860
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I have a few questions and I don't think I've formed an opinion yet because this is so fresh.

861
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
One of them what I guess one of the questions I have for you both and for the audience as

862
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:14,000
a whole is like, if you didn't know, an image was generated by a computer via these models

863
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
versus, you know, a human artist.

864
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Do you care?

865
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:25,000
You know, if there's a painting on your wall that is that you really love, does it matter?

866
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
From a philosophical point of view?

867
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I'm not I'm not sure and I'm still exploring that question.

868
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I think probably it doesn't unless you want to have a connection to another human being

869
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
who may be the artist.

870
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
That's a whole different reason to buy art.

871
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Yeah, I think there's a discussion about this and that sort of suggested that maybe the

872
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,000
art is not a like a true false, you know, there's like a spectrum that these things

873
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
can fall onto.

874
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Whereas like, you know, there's obviously the layer of like, does it evoke an emotional

875
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
response in you?

876
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Does it make you laugh?

877
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Does it bring you joy?

878
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Are you, you know, you want to, it inspires you to find more art like that, or it could

879
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,000
even find, inspire you to find more art, you know, real human artists or human artists

880
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,000
anyway, let's drop the real term there, who do art in that particular style.

881
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:16,000
And then of course, there's the side of you, you know, how much design and thought went

882
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
into the person crafting the prompt for the thing.

883
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,000
You generated a really cool, I mean, this is wallpaper material here.

884
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Yeah, and I was just trying to get it to do, I was playing on the, you know, Dragon SpaceX,

885
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I was trying to get like a dragon rocket thing, but just made me some real pretty dragon images.

886
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
If you join our matrix, even after listening, you can always scroll back in the JB General

887
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
chat, and you can see these pictures that have been posted.

888
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
They're fascinating.

889
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
They're absolutely fascinating.

890
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Yeah, I'm left a little bit like, it kind of makes me feel how copilot makes me feel.

891
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,000
And I thought that was an interesting thing where I feel like copilot could be used to

892
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:56,000
launder open code and people could then ship it in their closed source and be like, oh,

893
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I didn't, I didn't know it was, I mean, yeah, I might've put things in that kind of reproduced

894
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,000
the exact free software code I was looking for, but copilot did that, not me.

895
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
So I didn't, I didn't, I didn't break any copyright law.

896
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
It was copilot.

897
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,000
And I kind of feel like in a way you could do that with the stable diffusion stuff as

898
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
it gets more powerful.

899
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Cause this is like a few months into it being out in the general public and it's just remarkable

900
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
what we could do via Docker compose.

901
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
And like in a few minutes you've got a web instance up and going with a usable UI and

902
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
they could just start putting prompts in and tweaking stuff.

903
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
And I mean, it just blows my mind how far it's come in just a few months.

904
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
And I can only imagine how far it'll be in two, three, four years.

905
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I think it'll be producing indistinguishable from human created stuff.

906
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Yeah.

907
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
And the, you know, that stuff we were playing with, like replacing Levi with a penguin,

908
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
the, that in, in painting stuff or out painting where you can sort of take a seed image and

909
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
then generate surroundings around it.

910
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I think that has a lot of potential as well, just because, you know, that boy talk about

911
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
taking, taking over stuff you do in Photoshop before.

912
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Well, how funny would it be if for Linux users AI and using things like stable diffusion

913
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
became more possible and more, well, it has.

914
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
It's already happened.

915
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
It's more available than actual Photoshop is for Linux users.

916
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,000
You can use an entire AI construct to modify an image before Adobe got off their butt to

917
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
ship Photoshop for Linux.

918
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
It's just going to be irrelevant at some point.

919
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Yeah.

920
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Well, actually I've already used it.

921
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Okay.

922
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Sometimes I make Telegram stickers just because it's out of photos of, of some of my friends

923
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I have on Telegram.

924
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
It's kind of fun.

925
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
That's a great idea.

926
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Right.

927
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
And I've been using this little online tool.

928
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I think it's like remove.bg or something and remove background.

929
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
And it's just like a little online AI tool that does a decent job.

930
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
You got to pay for the full size, but for stickers, I never need that.

931
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
So it's like downgraded size, but it works fine.

932
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Yeah.

933
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
But if I ever wanted to do that, you know, it's thought it's occurred to me, like, this

934
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
is really handy.

935
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
There might be times where I'd want to pay for this because it's way faster than me cutting

936
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
it out by hand in Photoshop or something like that.

937
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Right.

938
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
And this can do the same thing, right?

939
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Like I can just, I can just like mark out the area that I don't want to be messed up

940
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
and then it'll replace the rest of the background.

941
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I used it to create a carport idea that I had in my mind, a general rough idea, so I

942
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
could show Hadiya a visual of what I was thinking about.

943
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Oh, that's smart.

944
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
This is a rough idea.

945
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
You know, you'd never want to use it for anything serious.

946
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I also heard a fellow podcaster tell me that he used this to create an example of the cover

947
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
art he was looking for for a new podcast that he's creating.

948
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
And then he took it once it got a general idea that looked crappy, but he took that

949
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
and gave it to an artist and they actually created something that he could ship.

950
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I've also heard of folks come up with like board game ideas and graphics for board games

951
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
that are like generated text and rules and images.

952
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
There's some pictures here that have been generated by the audience of a penguin flying

953
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
past Jupiter.

954
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I could see us using some of these actually for things.

955
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
These are kind of pretty.

956
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:54,000
And it does have an upsizer too, so you could upsize them for professional use too.

957
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
But isn't there copyright?

958
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Like wouldn't our audience members have to give us...

959
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Did they create it or did our server create it for them?

960
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
That's a really good question.

961
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Who owns that?

962
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
And so there's more and more.

963
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,000
There's like a bunch of mage spaces online that are used, stable diffusion and other

964
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
models.

965
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
But there's a lot of that out there too where like you got to be careful if you go type

966
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
in random prompts on the internet.

967
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Like a lot of them will say, well, we reserve rights to anything you generate by typing

968
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
in our prompt.

969
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
There's some really cool stuff getting generated with.

970
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Did you do that on ours?

971
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Yeah.

972
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Wow.

973
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
It's from yesterday, but yeah.

974
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
That looks like an evil...

975
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
It's supposed to be Waluigi.

976
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Oh, I see.

977
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
But it's got that mustache, right?

978
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Yeah.

979
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
These are really cool.

980
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Now, I know that makes for horrible audio podcasting.

981
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
So I'll just say again, you can find them in our chat.

982
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:47,000
But the idea is that again, like the Dragon wallpaper that you just posted and the Waluigi

983
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
picture, I honestly would not know that was AI generated.

984
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
I'm fine with that having them on the wall.

985
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
No problem.

986
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Yeah.

987
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Yeah.

988
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
That's just crazy.

989
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
There's zero tell with those two that you just...

990
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
You've gotten really good at the prompts.

991
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
You've been looking at what other people have been prompting in the generator.

992
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
And that's...

993
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Yeah, that's definitely you want to do that.

994
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Go find...

995
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
There's more and more sites that are popping up that you can go search for.

996
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
It's just like galleries of generated images with different models.

997
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
A lot of them specify which model was used and all that.

998
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
And then they have the prompts.

999
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
There's also some websites that'll help you do like a prompt maker sort of like, you know,

1000
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
WYSIWYG give pieces of the prompt.

1001
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
You can still like you want to make a landscape and you want to make it look like this and

1002
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
white and here's how the color profile should look or whatever.

1003
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Totally.

1004
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
There's a lot of tools out there that you can start playing with because sometimes you

1005
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
need really specific things in there to get the model to do exactly what you want.

1006
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Like if you really need to be like hyper realistic or you want a particular art style.

1007
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,000
I have an interesting question that I think is specific to this podcast.

1008
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:48,000
What if let's say in six months we want to take a holiday and some of the content or

1009
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,000
maybe even all of the content of a specific episode we just generated with our back catalog

1010
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:59,000
and it's so believable because it's taking, you know, new snippets from all the websites

1011
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:04,000
that we typically use and it would basically be an episode of Linux Unplugged.

1012
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
But we were on holidays doing it.

1013
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Would the audience be OK with that?

1014
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
If you tell them now we can't fake them out, Brent.

1015
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
This is a fun hypothetical though.

1016
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
It's a total hypothetical.

1017
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,000
But let's say it was legitimately good to listen to.

1018
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
It sounded really like us.

1019
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
It met our quality of release standards.

1020
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
You learned something new along the way.

1021
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Yeah, especially if you could put in new data.

1022
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:33,000
So it had 15 years worth of Linux stuff we've talked about plus new data.

1023
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
New Ferronix articles.

1024
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Yeah, put LWA and Ferronix in there and the Linux kernel mailing list.

1025
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
It's basically what we do on a weekly basis.

1026
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
What would you think of that audience?

1027
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Let us know.

1028
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Boostin or linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

1029
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
And maybe don't listen too closely in the future.

1030
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:58,000
So in lieu of a particular pick segment, what we're going to do is pack the show notes with some links.

1031
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Do we have a link to the one you can run on your CPU?

1032
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Do we have that one tracked down?

1033
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
If we can, we will put that in there.

1034
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,000
We'll absolutely put the one we've been using in there as well as a couple other alternatives.

1035
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
And I also am very much kind of feeling like Brent.

1036
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,000
I haven't really made up my mind about this and how I feel about it, the moralities of it.

1037
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:21,000
That's also something I'd be really interested in your feedback on out there, dear audience.

1038
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
And particularly, does it make you feel better?

1039
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Like Wes said, it is open source, so at least we can look under the hood.

1040
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
It doesn't seem like this technology is going to go away,

1041
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
but at least it is free software or open source so we can inspect it.

1042
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,000
And does that temper how you feel about it if you do have concerns?

1043
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Let us know. You can get a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com and boost in,

1044
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
or you can go to linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

1045
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Bitwarden.com slash linux. Bitwarden is our password management of choice.

1046
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,000
It's how we secure all kinds of secrets like recovery keys, two-factor authentication tokens,

1047
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
and of course, complicated secure passwords.

1048
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
It's also how I generate my usernames.

1049
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,000
And October is Cyber Security Awareness Month, and Bitwarden would like to remind everyone

1050
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
that using a good password manager could be one of the number one things you can do to stay safe.

1051
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,000
And they've just rolled out new features like password-protected vault export,

1052
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
a mobile username generator on the mobile app now.

1053
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
They're now also tying in with DuckDuckGo's email alias generation feature,

1054
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:27,000
so you can have a unique username, a unique email address, and also a unique password.

1055
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
I know a lot of you are Fastmail fans. They tie in with Fastmail as well,

1056
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,000
just to help reduce and cut down your spam, but also to eliminate your attack surface,

1057
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
so that way your username and your passwords aren't leaking out there together.

1058
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
There's so many great features in Bitwarden. They're constantly adding new stuff.

1059
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I've been so impressed. They've been a sponsor now for a few months,

1060
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
and new stuff gets added every single month that I get to tell you guys about.

1061
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:54,000
And Bitwarden is the easiest way for businesses or individuals to store, share, and sync sensitive data.

1062
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
If you're an individual or a business, head over to bitwarden.com slash Linux right now.

1063
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,000
It's the easiest way to get started, and it also will just greatly improve your security.

1064
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
And you may already know that. You guys probably already know that out there,

1065
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
because you're listening to the Linux Unplugged podcast. You're clever.

1066
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:16,000
But maybe a friend, family member, maybe it's Brent, maybe it's your place of work,

1067
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
maybe it's an open source project, maybe they could be doing things better.

1068
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Let them know, and send them to bitwarden.com slash Linux.

1069
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I think you'll be really impressed, and it's trusted by millions in the community.

1070
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:30,000
And of course, it's open source. So check it out for yourself and support the show.

1071
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Visit bitwarden.com slash Linux for yourself, your business, or maybe somebody in need.

1072
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

1073
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Instead of feedback this week, which we did get some great stuff. Thank you, everyone.

1074
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:50,000
We did want to focus a little bit more on some boosts that really got us pondering.

1075
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
So Chris, why don't you kick it off?

1076
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
And now it is time for the boost.

1077
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:02,000
It's specifically the subject. This is something that came up in my private life.

1078
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,000
I was having a conversation with a friend, and then we got a couple of boosts about ButterFS.

1079
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:13,000
And hybrid sarcasm, great name, boosted in with 2048 sats.

1080
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Count me among the ButterFS haters. I went ZFS years ago and never looked back.

1081
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Proxmox and Ubuntu make ZFS super easy.

1082
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I would like to know if your affinity for ButterFS is philosophical or technical.

1083
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
And if I should reconsider ButterFS.

1084
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
That's wonderful.

1085
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,000
So I think he's asking if it's philosophical because of the licensing differences, right?

1086
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,000
ButterFS is GPL. It's built into Linux kernel. It's all upstream.

1087
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
We don't have that luxury with ZFS.

1088
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,000
It's a more limited license, and it's not built into Linux kernel.

1089
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Here's my take on ButterFS.

1090
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:59,000
You guys know me. I was a ButterFS hater for like years on this show specifically.

1091
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
That would actually be a fun thing to go back and pull a few clips from.

1092
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Hypocrite Chris Laz's take on ButterFS.

1093
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Yeah.

1094
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
A few contrasting clips. Yeah.

1095
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Twice I lost data to ButterFS. Twice.

1096
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,000
I was not a ButterFS fan.

1097
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
But things change.

1098
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,000
And specifically in free software, sometimes things fundamentally shift.

1099
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:28,000
And what happened is the upshot of Facebook being a company is they do a lot of open source software development.

1100
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:33,000
And they dedicated some serious resources to ButterFS.

1101
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Including hiring one of the primary developers of ButterFS and letting them work on ButterFS.

1102
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
And then they deployed it.

1103
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
And then they continued to improve it.

1104
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:47,000
And over the last five years, ButterFS has made tremendous strides.

1105
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
And in most recent Linux kernels, the RAID 5.6 hole has been fixed as well.

1106
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Haven't tested it, but the team reports it's fixed.

1107
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
A lot of people have an old school view of file systems.

1108
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Back in the 80s and 90s, if a file system wrongs you, it didn't really get better.

1109
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:13,000
It was a bad file system and you were a good system admin or a good tech user if you just avoided the bad file systems.

1110
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Because they weren't getting any better.

1111
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
And it was a safe way to protect your data.

1112
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
And ButterFS started life with a bad reputation.

1113
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
And I think Red Hat has done a lot of damage here.

1114
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
They've really pushed people towards Stratus.

1115
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
And they've removed ButterFS support from RHEL.

1116
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
And I think that has sent a bad signal.

1117
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
And I think eventually Red Hat will have to correct course.

1118
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
It'll probably take them two more releases before they acknowledge it.

1119
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Because Stratus is like not... I get complaints about it all the time from the audience.

1120
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
It's just not solving problems for people.

1121
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
And Extended 4 is too basic of a file system.

1122
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
NTFS is better than Extended 4.

1123
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Extended 4 is basically Extended 3, which is basically Extended 2.

1124
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
It doesn't even have snapshots.

1125
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:00,000
It doesn't have some of the core functionality like send and receive that makes a system super quick to backup or restore.

1126
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
It doesn't have compression.

1127
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
It doesn't have encryption.

1128
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000
It doesn't have sub-volumes.

1129
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
You can't combine volumes.

1130
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
It's just so basic.

1131
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
And while I know a lot of you listening think, well, that's why I like it, Chris.

1132
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Good. But it's not competitive.

1133
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
It's not competitive.

1134
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,000
And the commercial operating systems, the freaking iPhones, man.

1135
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Freaking iPhones have a more sophisticated file system than your Linux box.

1136
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
It's just sad.

1137
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
And I blame Red Hat for a lot of this.

1138
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Because I think the server side would be deeper into ButterFS if Red Hat had put the resources into it that Facebook had.

1139
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
And so it's gotten better.

1140
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
And now I run ButterFS on everything.

1141
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,000
And there's an absolute tactical advantage to the combo of ButterFS and CFS.

1142
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Your core file systems, the things required to make your system boot and become available as ButterFS is chef's kiss.

1143
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Because after every kernel update, every reboot, that system comes online.

1144
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
And that's a fact.

1145
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Because you're not loading a third party external module into the kernel.

1146
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
That breaks sometimes.

1147
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
That's always been the way it is in Linux.

1148
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
It doesn't break often.

1149
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
But it inevitably does break.

1150
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
ButterFS doesn't have that problem.

1151
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Never will have that problem.

1152
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
It's GPL.

1153
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
It's upstream.

1154
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
It's built into the Linux kernel.

1155
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:19,000
That gives you an advantage if you depend on that disk being online for a system to be available.

1156
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Now, where I think you can have a little bit of your peanut butter and your jelly is you can also have large data sets that are still CFS.

1157
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
You can use both.

1158
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,000
It doesn't have to be a one or the other only world.

1159
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
And so ButterFS over time has greatly improved.

1160
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:41,000
And then when you consider low-end devices like Raspberry Pis or laptops that maybe have a single SSD, there's a lot.

1161
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:48,000
In fact, you could say millions of use cases or perhaps small VPSs, small virtual machines, things like that,

1162
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:55,000
that need the features of an advanced file system but can't particularly afford the overhead of the ZFS file system.

1163
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:01,000
There are millions of use cases like that and ButterFS is a perfect solution.

1164
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:06,000
I run it on all my Raspberry Pis and I have too many of them and it has worked great.

1165
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
And so it is mostly a technical.

1166
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:17,000
I guess philosophically I feel better that it's GPL but the licensing isn't what prevents me from using one over the other.

1167
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Right.

1168
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,000
If the license was right but the technology was wrong or just didn't work or kept losing your data still,

1169
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
then you probably wouldn't continue to use it.

1170
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Do you have any thoughts on philosophical versus technical?

1171
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:33,000
I mean, I've never really asked you if you have any preference of one over the other in that regard.

1172
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
No.

1173
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:40,000
I mean, I think ZFS, it could matter if it was the question to deploy a proprietary file system or not.

1174
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
I think that would maybe be closer.

1175
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,000
The licensing one with ZFS at least is just sort of an unfortunate particular details.

1176
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Yeah, of its origin.

1177
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Right.

1178
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:53,000
But whereas obviously OpenZFS is a very successful open source project, it's great.

1179
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:58,000
But no, I think I like your point that it's not don't just use ButterFest to use ButterFest.

1180
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Use ButterFest like when it makes sense and it meets your needs.

1181
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Use ZFS when it's the right file system or if you're more comfortable with it or if it was better designed for your particular use case.

1182
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,000
I'll tell you one nice advantage of ZFS for us has been portability.

1183
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Yeah.

1184
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:18,000
We've moved ZFS from a FreeNAS instance to a CentOS instance to an Arch instance.

1185
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Whatever crazy OS we're running.

1186
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Nix and you can move it around every single time and they're all going to work.

1187
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,000
And ZFS feature flags make it really easy to know what's going to work and what won't work.

1188
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Now you have to build, you know, might have to build the module on some systems, but that's fine.

1189
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
If you're comfortable with that, that's not a big deal.

1190
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,000
All right. And then on the same topic of ButterFest, that's why we wanted to make some room for this, guys,

1191
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:41,000
is because I think this is a conversation we need to have because people brought up to me privately.

1192
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Tim White 101 boosted with 26,001 SATs.

1193
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Coming in hot with the boost.

1194
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Tim White 101 writes, Hi, guys, I'm looking for input on ButterFest caching.

1195
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
ButterFest caching. All right.

1196
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,000
So he's got two 10 terabyte spin and rust drives and he's got a terabyte MVME drive.

1197
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
So he wants to split into two.

1198
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,000
But he's mixing up LVM and ButterFest in here quite a bit.

1199
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:08,000
And he's wondering, I hear differing views on Bcache or if I should wait for BcacheFS.

1200
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:13,000
ZFS offers L2 caching built in, but I'm worried that if I use ZFS caching with my MVME,

1201
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,000
it'll send it to an early grave because it'll do a lot of writes.

1202
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:21,000
So he's wondering if we have an advice on A, should he look into BcacheFS?

1203
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
B, should he look into ZFS caching?

1204
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Or C, is there a way you can do it all with ButterFest while avoiding wearing his drives down to basically nubbins?

1205
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Just there's a lot there. I mean, I think it probably depends like what is it?

1206
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Is it read and write caching?

1207
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
It's just like a read cache that might depend.

1208
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:43,000
I have seen some successful setups with Bcache doing the block layer caching in front of ButterFS.

1209
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
But you probably, I think, really depend on what you're at.

1210
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
What are you caching and why?

1211
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
How sensitive is it?

1212
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:55,000
And then probably whatever you do, if you have the time, you know, the affordances of getting to play with this stuff,

1213
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,000
you might just want to do some test setups and actually see like, do they meet your workloads?

1214
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Because it'd be hard without some details of what you're trying to hit to know exactly like,

1215
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,000
if you're just trying to save a little stuff, can you get by with just ButterFS on the default caching?

1216
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Is that good enough using in-memory or do you really need this additional device?

1217
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Could totally vary depending on how serious you are about what's pulling all this data

1218
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
and how often it's really going to be in the cache.

1219
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,000
I'm going to say tap the brakes on the Bcache and the BcacheFS stuff.

1220
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Yeah, also that like if you're going for prod right now, BcacheFS is not probably the thing you want to do.

1221
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
If you want to play with it, you should definitely play with it.

1222
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
I'm going to say take it off the table for now.

1223
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Play with it on a test machine.

1224
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Play around with it with some virtual VHD files.

1225
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Don't mess around with it right now.

1226
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Wait until he tells you it's ready.

1227
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Now, you didn't tell us what kind of rig you got in terms of RAM and CPU

1228
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,000
because that also plays a factor if you choose ZFS over ButterFS.

1229
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
I think you're going to probably figure out by now that if it's on the lower end of the spectrum,

1230
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
you might just want to consider ButterFS.

1231
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,000
I think you ought to test it like Wes is saying.

1232
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:57,000
I think you may be a little too worried about sending your MVME to an early grave.

1233
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:03,000
I have a lot of old SSDs and MVMEs that are even the crappy kind and they're still running.

1234
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:10,000
So I think the death of MVMEs due to cache writing has been slightly exaggerated.

1235
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Maybe I'm wrong on that.

1236
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
People out there have had a different experience.

1237
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Do let me know.

1238
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,000
But I would say go with Wes's recommendation.

1239
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Test ButterFS.

1240
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Play around with caching there.

1241
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Keep it really simple in that regard because you're going to have to come back to this in a year or two

1242
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
when something dies and replace it.

1243
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,000
And the simpler it is, the easier it's going to be to get up and going again.

1244
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
It does seem like the LVM route would definitely work.

1245
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Some folks seem to not like the LVM route because it's maybe less flexible or just more you got to learn.

1246
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,000
So that seems like if you're already comfortable with LVM, yeah, maybe just stick with that.

1247
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Totally could do.

1248
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Totally, totally could do.

1249
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
All right, moving right along.

1250
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
But thank you guys for boosting in.

1251
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,000
We got some really great ones this week, like some really great ones.

1252
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
So we appreciate everybody.

1253
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Batvin321 boosted in with a set of LeetSats.

1254
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Respect should be earned.

1255
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
He says, I'm also planning on going to Ohio Linux Fest.

1256
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:06,000
I should bring my retro FireWire DigiDesign 002 rackmount audio interface.

1257
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Maybe as old as me.

1258
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,000
It's so big I need to record on the back of my car for a tailgate recording.

1259
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
This is in reference to last week.

1260
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
We had a listener who's going to do some recording for us.

1261
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:21,000
I wanted to mention, we have the Columbus Club on Matrix.

1262
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
And this is where people can organize for Ohio Linux Fest.

1263
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,000
And we'll have a link to that in the show notes.

1264
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
GeneBean also boosted in with a set of LeetSats.

1265
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Respect should be earned.

1266
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:39,000
What I'm hearing from this review of the Thaleo is that this would be a great way for me to remove some thumb twiddling from my Gen 2 builds.

1267
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:45,000
GeneBean also sent in a boost saying that they'd provide us with some geocaching resources, and they did.

1268
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Nice. Thanks, GeneBean.

1269
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
So I think we've made the business decision to order a Thaleo.

1270
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:55,000
They're on sale right now, and they just, I believe, updated them with the 13th Gen Intel's.

1271
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
So I think that's going to happen.

1272
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
It's a big step. I'm still sitting with it.

1273
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
But I think it's going to be our replacement OBS machine.

1274
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
That's so exciting.

1275
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:10,000
My logic being that one of these three machines, I predict, will die in the next two months.

1276
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I'm betting it's the OBS machine.

1277
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:18,000
So I'd like to get replacement hardware in so I can start the transition before it dies.

1278
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
See what I did there? Before it dies.

1279
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Weird.

1280
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Yeah.

1281
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
That's odd.

1282
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Wait, wait, wait.

1283
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
I'm saying before it's an emergency.

1284
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Okay. Wow. I'm not used to this.

1285
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Or, you know what, we'll order it, it'll sit around in the box for a few weeks, and then it'll die and we'll get it set up.

1286
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
It still might be an emergency.

1287
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Now, my understanding was that someone on the business insisted that you had to run NixOS on there, right?

1288
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
That was the only condition.

1289
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Chris, I have a question whether you have an update on the Thaleo from last week.

1290
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Did you ever figure out what went wrong with that thing?

1291
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Yes, we had a problem where it powered off on us randomly.

1292
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:53,000
And then, Brent, I'm not kidding you, we were sitting here after the show working on post-show stuff,

1293
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
and I went upstairs and it powered up.

1294
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Come on.

1295
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
From off all the way to on.

1296
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
It's those solar storms we've been having.

1297
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Yeah, I don't know if the case was loose or what.

1298
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
I was going to toy with it, and then I ended up getting sick.

1299
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:09,000
I got a stomach bug, so I wanted to ship it back and get it back to them so they can take a look at it.

1300
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
We'll figure it out.

1301
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
I still think you broke the button.

1302
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
I did love that button.

1303
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
I pushed a lot of buttons.

1304
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Tebulas boosted in with 250 cents.

1305
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Went to the Folsom Cash and struck out.

1306
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
We'll try again, but we'll bring gloves in a trash bag.

1307
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Nice place, but it needs a little bit of pickup.

1308
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Struck out.

1309
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,000
So does that mean they didn't find it, or does it mean somebody else already found it and hasn't said anything?

1310
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Well, that question, I believe, is probably hard to answer if you don't know where the cash is.

1311
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,000
So we might have to...

1312
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Maybe listener Jeff can go out there and check it out.

1313
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Where's the way?

1314
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
It was Folsom.

1315
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Oh, Folsom.

1316
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Yeah, it was near Jeff.

1317
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
No, I bet it's...

1318
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
No, Folsom was found.

1319
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
It was Folsom was already found.

1320
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
I don't think so.

1321
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
I disagree completely.

1322
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
I think we need a tracker.

1323
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
All right.

1324
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
All right.

1325
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Okay.

1326
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
All right.

1327
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Okay.

1328
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Acerbic also boosted in with 1007 cents.

1329
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Boost!

1330
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Starting to get into geocaching with my kids and would love to be the Western Australia geocacher for JB.

1331
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Also willing to take over other caches with JB stickers.

1332
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Ah, all right.

1333
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,000
I feel like this geocaching thing might just take off.

1334
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
I mean, I'm having fun with it, but...

1335
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:27,000
I wonder if they'd be willing to join us in Matrix and then we could set up a little room for people who volunteer to do this.

1336
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
That's not a bad idea.

1337
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Are you saying we should have a geocache room in Matrix?

1338
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,000
I mean, somebody may have suggested earlier and I'm coming around to it.

1339
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Cash club?

1340
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Yeah.

1341
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
The geocache group?

1342
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
The geocache jive?

1343
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Nope.

1344
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
No good.

1345
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Geocache cat?

1346
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Nope.

1347
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Got nothing.

1348
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
We should probably let the members of the group decide their group name.

1349
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Marcel boosted in with 2,222 sats.

1350
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
And you know what that is, Chris.

1351
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Rho dux.

1352
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Of course you start talking about a Toronto meetup just as I move out of that area.

1353
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
When's the Munich meetup?

1354
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Sorry, Marcel.

1355
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
We'll have to let you know on that one.

1356
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Yeah, sorry.

1357
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Yeah.

1358
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:16,000
You see Rio A also boosted in saying I'll second a Vancouver or especially a Victoria meetup.

1359
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
You've started something, Brent.

1360
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I think my crew is starting to wake up.

1361
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
I like it.

1362
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Uh oh.

1363
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Oh, another boost from Marcel with a row of dux.

1364
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Nicole Lovay has a good video about the Fedora Kodak issue.

1365
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:42,000
He explains that RedHot could not really wait until they got sued because knowingly violating

1366
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:47,000
a patent is three times the fine of unknowingly violating a patent.

1367
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,000
So once they found out, they had to act quickly.

1368
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Sure, I'd like to have the Kodak, but I'm not paying anything for Fedora.

1369
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,000
And like you said, most people will probably find workarounds.

1370
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,000
I find Linux users can be very entitled sometimes.

1371
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
You're right.

1372
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
They could license it.

1373
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
They're rich.

1374
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,000
I think people get hung up on the should RedHat license it discussion.

1375
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:13,000
I don't think that's the core thing to focus on at all on this.

1376
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:17,000
I would like to know why anything really fundamentally changed.

1377
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:21,000
You're telling me they didn't know that Mesa had these capabilities.

1378
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
They weren't knowingly shipping Mesa before.

1379
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
I mean, of course they were.

1380
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,000
RedHat legal didn't realize and get a whiff of something.

1381
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Are we all to just sit here and think that the Fedora developers don't understand how

1382
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:37,000
this works, that they're so all ignorant that they don't realize that Mesa had these capabilities?

1383
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:43,000
And then the other thing that I think I wish could be done is some kind of middle ground.

1384
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:48,000
You know, like the way Canonical has done it in the past where there's a checkbox where

1385
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
the user can choose to install them.

1386
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Fedora came up with a way for regular old users to install the NVIDIA proprietary graphics

1387
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
driver from GNOME software.

1388
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:04,000
And it feels like if we can overcome that hurdle and make it possible for users to get

1389
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:10,000
the proprietary NVIDIA binary driver, seems like silly old codecs that no end user is

1390
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,000
going to get sued over realistically should be solvable and there should be tooling that

1391
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
could be made.

1392
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,000
But I don't look like that's happening.

1393
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
And I think like the focus on, oh, RedHat should pay for it.

1394
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,000
That's just kind of a silly discussion to begin with.

1395
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,000
The question I had really around that was, is it even feasible?

1396
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Could something like that even be done for a price when you don't exactly have exact

1397
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
numbers of the user base?

1398
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
There's no way to really know.

1399
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
So how would you even license that?

1400
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
And could you just buy a bulk license like that?

1401
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
I don't know.

1402
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,000
And I don't know if we'd actually expect RedHat to ever do something like that.

1403
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:47,000
I think the bigger questions come around, what are the other distributions doing and

1404
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,000
why aren't they panicking?

1405
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,000
I've seen some talk that openSUSE is going to make a change.

1406
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Why are the thousands of other distributions not going into some sort of panic?

1407
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,000
And then what's really the difference?

1408
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Unless we're all just thinking maybe they didn't know Mesa had this support to begin

1409
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
with.

1410
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,000
But yeah, it's a shitty situation, I'll tell you that much.

1411
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
And I mean, it's amateur hour.

1412
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Sucks that it happened to a great distribution like Fedora.

1413
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,000
I think it's changed things for me and the way I view Fedora.

1414
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
I view it as vulnerable now.

1415
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:26,000
I view it as vulnerable to commercial interests that override the best interest for Fedora.

1416
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Maybe that's the compromise we have to take to have an entity behind Fedora that has the

1417
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,000
time and dedicated resources to develop things.

1418
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
But I'm still sitting with that.

1419
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:43,000
It makes me appreciate more distributions like Arch and Nix that don't suffer from the

1420
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:47,000
political whims of their patron.

1421
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:51,000
And I don't think I'll ever view Fedora quite the same way anymore.

1422
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:55,000
I still respect the project, still going to probably use it from time to time.

1423
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Something shifted for me at least.

1424
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:02,000
This is really kind of an unforgivable thing just because it was user hostile and there

1425
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,000
was no real effort put in to really solve the problem for users before they take it

1426
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,000
away.

1427
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,000
And there's still time, but I don't see anything happening.

1428
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,000
That's all.

1429
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:15,000
And yeah, we could talk more about should Red Hat buy things, but I think that's the

1430
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
silly part of the conversation.

1431
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Well, Grunerl.

1432
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Yep, Grunerl.

1433
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Boosts in with 1000 cents.

1434
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Pew!

1435
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Greetings from Germany.

1436
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
And don't forget your foreign listeners.

1437
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,000
What do you think about the future of Lure?

1438
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Thanks for making my daily commute a happy time and enjoying it for years.

1439
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,000
I'm wondering if this is something you boys would be interested in trying out.

1440
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:48,000
So Lure, L-U-R-E, is intended to bring the Arch user repository to all distributions.

1441
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
So this is how I can get my Fedora codex.

1442
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Great.

1443
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Yeah, right.

1444
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
It's currently in a very alpha state.

1445
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,000
It's built in Go, has zero dependencies after it's been built.

1446
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:02,000
The only thing that Lure needs is a command for privilege avalation or escalation as such

1447
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
as pseudo or something like that.

1448
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:10,000
And then of course, a supported package manager in this case, current support for apt, Pacman,

1449
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:15,000
APKs, DNF, yum, and zipper.

1450
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:19,000
It's funny because, you know, Nyx package manager is kind of the universal thing to

1451
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
go to now, but I don't know.

1452
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Brent, Wes, you guys interested in playing around with this?

1453
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
You want to try it?

1454
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
I think we better try.

1455
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
You're right.

1456
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Like Nyx has been meeting a lot of my portable package management dreams lately, but the

1457
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,000
AOR is great.

1458
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
And so something that carries on that spirit.

1459
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
I've got to try.

1460
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Brent, you want to give it a go?

1461
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
I'd be super tempted.

1462
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:39,000
I mean, it sounds like they're doing a Herculean effort here that we've been asking for for

1463
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
years.

1464
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000
So why not?

1465
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Well, now I'm just curious.

1466
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Like, do we have things for production like Reaper, Sonobus?

1467
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Right?

1468
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Who knows?

1469
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Is it everything in the AUR?

1470
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
All right.

1471
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
We got to play with it.

1472
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Well, Neve boosted and with not quite a row of duck.

1473
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
It's 2022 sets.

1474
01:13:54,000 --> 01:14:01,000
I want to say this year has been exciting in the hardware space.

1475
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Far more than software.

1476
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:08,000
As such, I, with my own money, picked up an ARC GPU, which I found on my doorstep this

1477
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,000
morning.

1478
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Ah, congrats.

1479
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Of course, I just overheard Chris talking about the OBS machine failing and would like

1480
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,000
to donate this brand new GPU that's still in the box to JB.

1481
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
What?

1482
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
I'm willing to pay the shipping.

1483
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Just tell me where to send it.

1484
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
What?

1485
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Have we said recently that we have the best listeners?

1486
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
I don't know if we can accept that.

1487
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
What if we borrowed it for a bit?

1488
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Oh, yeah.

1489
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Okay.

1490
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,000
And then when we can find one, we'll order it and then we send it back to you, Neve,

1491
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000
so you can have it back.

1492
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Because, I mean, I would really love to try one for the show.

1493
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
I'd love to use one in an OBS build.

1494
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:47,000
I have been getting very mixed reports on how well it's working for people.

1495
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,000
So it's definitely now like I cutely want to try it out.

1496
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
So I will email you back, Neve.

1497
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
How about I borrow it from you?

1498
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
And that is very generous.

1499
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Thank you.

1500
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Neve is watching live right now, too.

1501
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,000
So that is really great.

1502
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Because, yeah, I was looking at the arcs.

1503
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
I'm like, I missed my window.

1504
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Dang it.

1505
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,000
And would you throw it in the new Thaleo then, Chris?

1506
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Yeah, totally, dude.

1507
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Yeah, for sure.

1508
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Make OBS great again.

1509
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Mitch from Podverse boosted with 5,000 sats.

1510
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
B-O-O-S-T.

1511
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Just with a go podcasting.

1512
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:26,000
I had a little opportunity to chat with Mitch this week because, as you both saw, Pocketcast

1513
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
announced that they have gone open source.

1514
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Indeed.

1515
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:34,000
And so I was chatting with our buddy Mitch because Podverse is a podcasting 2.0 client

1516
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
that's GPL.

1517
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,000
And it's available for Android, iOS, and the web.

1518
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:43,000
And it's the embedded player we're now using on the new Jupyter Broadcasting website.

1519
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
And I just was curious Mitch's take on it.

1520
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:53,000
And Mitch saw a huge spike in traffic for Podverse on the day Pocketcast announced they

1521
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
went open source.

1522
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Interesting.

1523
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
That is fascinating.

1524
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,000
That's great, right?

1525
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:02,000
And I think it's in part because Podcast has been talking about Podverse, but also I think

1526
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:07,000
it's people are opening up the idea of an open source podcast app is a great idea.

1527
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Why do I need a proprietary company to play an MP3 file again?

1528
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Yeah, right?

1529
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:16,000
And also you think about it's an open independent media ecosystem, like the only one that exists.

1530
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Yeah, right?

1531
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
It's like the only one that exists.

1532
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:23,000
And why pair that with a commercial closed app?

1533
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Gosh, like the idea of like, oh, no, no, you know, my podcast provider, they lost the licensing

1534
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
with Jupyter Broadcasting, so I can't listen to love anymore.

1535
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
The whole back catalog.

1536
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Yeah.

1537
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
We're fighting over Coderadio.

1538
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Yeah.

1539
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
That's great.

1540
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
So it was great to catch up with Mitch.

1541
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,000
I think we're going to have a lot to chat with him about on Office Hours and a future

1542
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
episode coming up soon.

1543
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Michael B. boosted in with 3000 sats.

1544
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Hey, Chris and team.

1545
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:55,000
I would love to hear your thoughts on the streaming sats while listening features in

1546
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,000
the new apps.

1547
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Is it a sustainable source of value or do you see a higher amount with boost?

1548
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Thanks for the great show, Michael.

1549
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:09,000
This is a really great question, and I really appreciate that Michael's even kind of asking

1550
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:13,000
this question because what he's really trying to get at is what's the best way for me to

1551
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
return value to the podcast while listening.

1552
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Right.

1553
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,000
My take on this is always whatever system works best for you.

1554
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:24,000
If the set it and forget it with sat streaming is a better method for you.

1555
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:30,000
I like that because it gives me a bit of signal when you're listening because, you know, I

1556
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:36,000
see it on my dashboard that, you know, Michael B. just sent in X amount of sats, but there's

1557
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,000
no message with it.

1558
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,000
So I also really like the boost because they have a message with it.

1559
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,000
And I feel like the baller boosts and all the different boosts are a great way to invest

1560
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
in a particular episode production.

1561
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
They're also just a really motivator for the team.

1562
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:52,000
It's exciting the sort of real time connection that per episode connection like, oh, they

1563
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
were listening to that thing that we said.

1564
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
It makes a huge difference to that button is right there in the app.

1565
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Right.

1566
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:02,000
And then we have our members and our members are like our our investors on our board that

1567
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:07,000
are always investing in the ongoing production of every episode for a sustained period of

1568
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
time.

1569
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,000
And it is so much stress to us.

1570
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
It's yeah, it unpluggedcore.com.

1571
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Either system, you know, might work better for different people depending on what they

1572
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,000
got going on every day and in their life and whatnot, how they like to manage that kind

1573
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,000
of stuff.

1574
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:26,000
So today we don't see like a big source of revenue from the strat from the sat streaming.

1575
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,000
We get a higher overall one, I would suppose from the boost.

1576
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
But that's not really why we do this.

1577
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,000
So I don't generally have a preference in there.

1578
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:39,000
But I really appreciate that you're thinking about that because, you know, it is a small

1579
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,000
independent boutique business.

1580
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:46,000
It's not something that is too big to fail.

1581
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:52,000
If the ad market were to turn sour for a sustained period of time, things would get pretty lean

1582
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
around here.

1583
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,000
But it's nice to know that we have some of these real baseline essentials taken care

1584
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
of.

1585
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:01,000
So Mars X-Ray boosted in with 1024 sats.

1586
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
First time booster.

1587
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Just wanted to say keep up the great work on the podcast.

1588
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Long live Linux.

1589
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Or at least some representation of Linux.

1590
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Yours open source Lee Mars X-Ray.

1591
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Love seeing the first time boosters.

1592
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
That's so great.

1593
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:20,000
And then our last boost of the day came from a great username from Thought Criminal with

1594
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
one thousand nine hundred ninety nine sats.

1595
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Boost community supported independent media on open source.

1596
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Yeah, yeah.

1597
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:32,000
It was a cool idea a few months ago and now it's even easier than visiting a sponsor or

1598
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
sending an email.

1599
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Thanks for tuning me in on the way forward.

1600
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
I'm in.

1601
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
That is so great.

1602
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Thought Criminal.

1603
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Thank you.

1604
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Also, I just want to say a big thank you out there to everybody who boosted in.

1605
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Not all of them get on the show.

1606
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:49,000
We did a big batch this week because the content was just top notch.

1607
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
A lot of those got us talking.

1608
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
A lot of thought provoking discussion there.

1609
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
So that's the bar.

1610
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
And so we really appreciate the support.

1611
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
We read all of them.

1612
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,000
If you didn't make it on the show, doesn't mean it wasn't a great boost.

1613
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,000
It just might mean we got tight on time or we were going for a particular theme like we

1614
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
did with ButterFest this week.

1615
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
But we appreciate and read all of them.

1616
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Thank you, everybody.

1617
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
A couple of shout outs.

1618
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,000
A thousand stats from Opie on the live show topics.

1619
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,000
I'll follow up on that.

1620
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Thank you for live shows and production.

1621
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Five thousand stats from Ninja Mort, who wanted to give a shout out to Easel App and also

1622
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
tell us to keep up the great work.

1623
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
We got 1492 stats.

1624
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,000
I feel like that's a particular number from Ruark.

1625
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Oh, they boosted in their earned stats while listening to us on Fountain.

1626
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Very particular indeed.

1627
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Interesting.

1628
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:39,000
A thousand stats from RastakastaVersa, who was the first to report a QA issue.

1629
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
We had in last week's episode.

1630
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Thanks, Rasta.

1631
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Appreciate that.

1632
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:48,000
And we got a hundred stats from NowScienceNews, who is hoping that power prices will eventually

1633
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
come down so they can get into self-hosting.

1634
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
We hear you.

1635
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:59,000
But check out things like the Odroid H3 NowScienceNews because that thing's sipping like five watts

1636
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:04,000
and I would bet for 90 percent of home use cases, especially when you consider it has

1637
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,000
quick sync for video decoding, I bet it would solve 90 percent of people's use cases.

1638
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Chris' low power colo.

1639
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,000
There you go.

1640
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Set it up here.

1641
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Sell it to you in sacks.

1642
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:17,000
If you'd like to send a boost into the show, newpodcastapps.com.

1643
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
You can also just boost with Podverse.

1644
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
I got a note from a listener.

1645
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
I said, you know, I tried out Breeze.

1646
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,000
I don't know.

1647
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
I want to stick with AntennaPod.

1648
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:29,000
So what I do is I just load up the Podverse website and boost from there.

1649
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Oh, that's a nice way to do it.

1650
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Pull up the old show and boost from there.

1651
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Very convenient.

1652
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Yeah.

1653
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Totes cool.

1654
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:40,000
We will have lots of links and resources for the diffusion stuff that we talked about,

1655
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:44,000
for some of the AI voice stuff we talked about, all kinds of things in there.

1656
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
So do check out linuxunplug.com.

1657
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Slash 481.

1658
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
481.

1659
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Or go to the new website.

1660
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Give it a go.

1661
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Jupiterbroadcasting.com.

1662
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:59,000
You know, go kick the tires and then catch office hours this week because we'll be talking

1663
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,000
about that new website.

1664
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Won't we, Brent?

1665
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Yes, we will.

1666
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
We might even have a special guest.

1667
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Oh, there you go.

1668
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:12,000
We do this show on Sundays and we do office hours on Tuesdays, both of which are noon

1669
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,000
at Pacific time and 3 p.m. on the East Coast time, which is where Brent is at now.

1670
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000
It's true.

1671
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Weird.

1672
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,000
You got to try all the time zones.

1673
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,000
See which one you like best.

1674
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Brent Coast time?

1675
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Yeah, it's the Brent Coast.

1676
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,000
See you next week.

1677
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Same bad time, same bad station.

1678
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
And that does wrap us up this week.

1679
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,000
If you'd like to see how the sausage was made, you can head over to Jupiter.Tube or you can

1680
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:35,000
become a member where we curate a custom made file just for you.

1681
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
We'd love to have you there.

1682
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,000
It's a lot of fun and you get to play around with some of our tools when we talk about

1683
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
it.

1684
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,000
But if you can't make it, we understand.

1685
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
That's how it goes for most people.

1686
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,000
No hard feelings at all.

1687
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,000
You can always chat with us after the fact in our Matrix room.

1688
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:52,000
You can get details at Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Matrix.

1689
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,000
And of course, there's a slash mumble for all of our mumble details.

1690
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

1691
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:04,000
And I hope we'll see you right back here next Sunday.

1692
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Still some pictures coming in.

1693
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Oh, wow.

1694
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,000
These are so fun.

1695
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
There's the most recent one is of you.

1696
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Oh, yeah.

1697
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,000
I love this one MiniMech did of a tux drinking a beer.

1698
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
That's great.

1699
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,000
That is really good MiniMech.

1700
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Sonic the Hedgehog in there.

1701
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Penguin on the beach.

1702
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:01,000
This looks like a JFK going down the street, but it's a car full of tuxes.

1703
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
You guys got my drift with this one.

1704
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
All right.

1705
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Oh, boy.

1706
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Here's one of me.

1707
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,000
It's kind of close.

1708
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,000
I like that it's sort of a reverse SMB7.

1709
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Like they almost got it.

1710
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Yeah, it's got a podcast mic.

1711
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
It's got a computer screen.

1712
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,000
What's on that whiteboard?

1713
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
I want to know.

1714
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Yeah.

1715
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Yeah, I don't know.

1716
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,000
And it's got me in a shirt.

1717
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
That's a shirt style I would actually wear.

1718
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Where are the suspenders?

1719
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Right.

1720
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,000
It does need and these podcast setups are actually pretty good.

1721
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:35,000
I like the, you know, this is funny how some of these actually really are.

1722
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
God, Wes, you make the best ones.

1723
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Jeez.

1724
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
It's worth going in the chat just to see these.

1725
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Wes Payne, you're an AI digital director artist guy over there.

1726
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,000
I'm very impressed.

1727
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Trying for like Batcave here.

1728
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
That was inspired by Mars X-ray.

1729
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
You know, that's just a fun name.

1730
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:58,000
But it just took super complicated machine learning, AI models, and a little docker compose

1731
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
to bring out Wes Payne's creative side.

1732
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Yeah, that's right.

1733
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Pencil and paper?

1734
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:23,000
Heck no.
