WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
There was something else I wanted to share with the class before we started, before we go here.

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
Oh yeah, this might be kind of fun.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
This was submitted to the Linux Action Show subreddit.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
Here at JB, we fantasize about 4K video, 60 frames per second,

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
and we kind of joke about how long it's going to take us to be able to get there.

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
Meanwhile, these guys in the pro field are doing 8K video under Linux.

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
We're seeing footage that's 4K, 6K, even 8K footage now with the RED coming in

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
with the weapon and all that stuff.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
So we have to be able to run this back in a time when I have clients paying to work with me,

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
paying to sit with me, where things run real time, nice and smooth, there's no hiccups.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
I mean, I have Resolve on my laptop, and if I tried to put an 8K shot in my laptop, it might explode.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
We're running on a Linux system. I'll show you what we've got in here.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
So here she is. This is where all the magic happens.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 163 for September 20th, 2016.

01:10.000 --> 01:17.000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's always looking for an excuse to talk about video games.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
My name is Chris. My name is Wes.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
Hello, Wes. 163 is going to be a big show today, sir.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
We have really big updates to get into.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
Big Plasma desktop updates, GNOME updates coming down.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
The hype is real, we'll tell you why.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
It looks like Slack may have a legitimate open source competitor,

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
and before you go to sleep, I'll tell you why you should care.

01:38.000 --> 01:45.000
Then we'll answer the question, is your SSH password accidentally revealed if you connect to the wrong server?

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
The answer may surprise you. Stay tuned for more.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
That's what they say on your local media.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
And then later on in the show, we're going to get our gaming on.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
The Linux Gamer on YouTube is joining us.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
The Linux Gamer on Twitter is here.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
We're going to dig into a little bit of what he's doing, what he's up to.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
And then I want to talk about some new games that are coming out for Linux.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
One specifically that if they had a line where you could stand outside a store and camp overnight to get it,

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
I would be in that line.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
I'll tell you about that game towards the end of the show.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
So that's all coming up today.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
Before all of that, we've got to get into some project updates.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
Some of the favorites out there have got big news, big changes coming down the pipe.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
So Wes, what do you say we bring in our virtual love?

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Let's do it.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Time appropriate greetings, Bumba Room.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Hey.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Hello.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Hello.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Hello.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Hello.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Hello, guys.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Hello, guys.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
So I'm excited everybody's here because we have much to catch up on

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
because I prerecorded last Sunday's Linux action show.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
So I feel like I've been off the air for Linux topics for a while now.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
You're fresh.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
You're ready.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Did you hear that airplane flying overhead to welcome us?

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
He wants to hear some Linux news, too.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
I bet he's transporting lawn mowers to another part of the country that still has lawns to mow.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Yep.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Why don't we start off with some interesting news?

02:58.000 --> 03:06.000
This one's coming in from Microsoft, and I suspect I have a prediction that I suspect it's going to go kind of good for Linux users.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
It starts with some bad news.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
They're shutting down their London office as they're going to develop yet another Skype client.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Did you hear about the shenanigans?

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
It's crazy.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
Microsoft, like, here's what they got right now on the market.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Yeah, they set it up very well here.

03:19.000 --> 03:26.000
Currently, the company has the traditional Windows desktop app, the new universal Windows platform app for Windows 10,

03:26.000 --> 03:36.000
Windows 10 mobile, Xbox apps, the Skype web client, a web-based or electron-based standalone app for Linux,

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
which reportedly has internal builds for Windows, too.

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
And, of course, then Skype has an iOS app, an Android app, and a Mac OS client.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
So it's an excessive number of clients.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
It's ridiculous.

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
And so what Ars Technica is reporting is that Microsoft's solution has developed yet another client.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
That'll solve it.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
This one called Skype for Life.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
I think that means it's for everything.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Skype for Life.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
I feel like that could be in a tattoo.

04:00.000 --> 04:08.000
The one client to rule them all, as you could say, will be cross-platform, covering not just Windows, but Linux, Mac OS, iOS, and Android.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
And you know what I read into that?

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
This is my prediction.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
That sounds like the electron app they started working on for Linux.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
They're like, oh, this is a good idea.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Turns out everyone's making everything an electron app.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
I guess we'll jump on board.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Let's do it.

04:20.000 --> 04:27.000
The new client along with Skype for Business and the new Slack-like Skype team features are being developed back in Redmond.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
So the development's going to be happening here in Washington, in our neck of the woods.

04:30.000 --> 04:40.000
This is, I think, going to be one of the first huge apps, really one of the biggest apps using electron everywhere, eventually.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
I would think they could be one of the first.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
I know they're like, you and I, are you still using N1?

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Yes, a little bit.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
Probably one of the other most advanced electron apps I've ever used.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
It's very sophisticated, lots of features.

04:52.000 --> 04:59.000
And then my list begins to trail off on the level of sophistication of electron apps, and I usually think of them as bloated and slow.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Right, then it's just kind of a wrapper around a webpage.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
Yeah, yeah.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
This is an interesting maybe.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
I don't want to call it focus yet, but it's maybe focus coming onto the Skype platform, which I don't know.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
I know some Linux users who feel kind of trapped because they have a lot of friends on Skype still.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
They have a Windows VM for it or whatever.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
If we can get somewhere where we don't need that.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Jitsi meet everybody.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Yeah, Jitsi meet's a better way to go too.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
Okay, so anyone in the Mamba room, if you have any thoughts on Skype, you are welcome to chime in, but I assume we'd probably just move on.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
I think we all kind of agree Skype is, it feels like it's yesterday's thing.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
A lot of us still have to use it.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
I'm one of them.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
So I can't say nobody uses Skype, but it feels like, oh, that's next on my list to stop using.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
We need like a plug-in that just sends people Jitsi meet rooms.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Yeah, exactly.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
I'm not available on this proprietary platform.

05:45.000 --> 05:53.000
Okay, so let's talk about the next big releases from both GNOME and Plasma, or KD I suppose.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
These are going to be huge, and there's been some hype already started for GNOME 3.22.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
I thought I'd cover a couple of the nice items.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
This is supposed to release tomorrow as we record this, so that's why we're going to talk about this.

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
I think the one that most of us will probably appreciate the most are the changes to Nautilus.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
Nautilus' code base has been unified.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Yeah, they're hyping this up a lot.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
Yeah, they say newcomers can be able to dig in a little easier, which kind of makes sense.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
Yeah, that's an impressive feature, especially if you're cleaning up a lot of cruft.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
That takes a lot of work.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Yeah, the internals are in a lot better shape.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
There's a new batch rename tool.

06:26.000 --> 06:31.000
They've integrated file compression, which also integrates with the new Nautilus progress popover.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
To build that in, they've been using FileRoller for years now.

06:35.000 --> 06:41.000
Also, it makes me feel like I know people are still upset about when they change things, they kind of drop a lot of features.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
It feels like maybe now they're kind of adding some things, but they're doing it, or at least trying to do it in a cohesive,

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
thought-out, holistic approach where it fits when they do have it.

06:49.000 --> 06:57.000
Yeah, and as an example, so the detail, it sounds like, oh yeah, they've integrated compression into the file manager, whoop-de-do.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
But actually, when they do this, they do it in a real unique kind of way.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
They really pay attention to details, and it's not just that they've integrated with the popover.

07:06.000 --> 07:12.000
It also supports all of the standard key commands and functionalities that users just expect from Nautilus.

07:12.000 --> 07:17.000
So undo capability and things like that that traditionally you don't have, you now have,

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
because, well, as an end user, that's what you expect with Nautilus, so they deliver that functionality in the compression.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
So I think there's actually some nice work that went into it.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
Gnome Calendar is actually usable now with support for alarms.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Hey, nice.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
There isn't a good idea.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
And the ability to drag and drop events and move them around on the calendar, again.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Also, yeah.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
Gnome Music got a big, big rework. It's fast as hell now, they say.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
And Gnome Games is kind of neat. I haven't played with it myself.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
I'm going to reserve judgment to comment on it.

07:44.000 --> 07:51.000
I'm a little skeptical at this point, but supposedly it automatically discovers ROMs on your box,

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
automatically downloads the cover art for it.

07:54.000 --> 07:59.000
Then you double click and it launches the appropriate emulator, assuming you have it installed.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
Again, I'm a little skeptical of that particular feature.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
It seems like an interesting feature for a free software type platform.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
But if it makes it pretty, I'm not opposed to it.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
Now, there's also been some nice improvements to this version of GTK,

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
which I don't know if I'm fully up to date to speak on.

08:13.000 --> 08:20.000
I don't know if anybody in the Mumber Room has a better grasp of some of the big changes that are coming in GTK 3.22.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
I know Wimpy does, so if he stops by later, we might ask him.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
He's in the front and center of it.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
Ferronix covers a couple other features that I think we could grok a little easily.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
I think probably one of the first places, or maybe not, it depends on the release,

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
but everybody takes a little while to ship Gnome,

08:36.000 --> 08:42.000
so Fedora 25 will likely be one of the first places you can get Gnome 3.22.

08:42.000 --> 08:48.000
So far, one of the hopeful features of Fedora 25 is Wayland out of the box by default now.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Oh boy.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
And in conjunction, again, Gnome 3.22 has seen a ton of work for Wayland support.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
Big improvements here in this.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
So that's one of the major features in Gnome 3.22 that has also gotten some improvement.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
And Gnome software now supports flat packs.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
I wonder if there's anything that should be something for Gnome releases.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
You know how good kernels are, aren't they weasels?

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
I wonder if there should be like Gnome.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
At least in the three branches, there's been a lot of like, well, that's kind of the turning point,

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
when everyone started using it, and maybe we're coming to another good stable point.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Yeah, maybe we can pick up on this next week when I know more,

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
but I seem to recall there's something important about Gnome 3.22 being a longer-term,

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
like, stable, predictable GTK.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
And I don't remember why that is, but I do remember there being some details about that.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
So maybe we'll pick it up next week if we can dig up the details.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Stay tuned.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
So there's your Gnome update, now here's your Plasma update.

09:37.000 --> 09:43.000
Gnome 5.8 is also going to be released soon, and this is going to be a long-term support edition.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
And there's a bunch of new updates and improvements to it, like improved desktop widgets,

09:47.000 --> 09:52.000
the ability to sort of refresh the backend on things like the KDE App Store,

09:52.000 --> 09:57.000
they've improved the Breeze theme, so it has a unified look across basically all toolkits,

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
Qt 4, 5, GTK 2, 3.

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
So even LibreOffice kind of looks like it belongs on a Breeze desktop now, which is pretty nice.

10:05.000 --> 10:11.000
KDE Connect, the super cool app that connects your Android device and lets you text from your desktop

10:11.000 --> 10:17.000
and transfer files and copy files and clipboard stuff, that's going to be front and center in this release.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
And they also have unified boot up to shut down artwork, all kinds of things.

10:22.000 --> 10:29.000
And I will say when the release comes out, keep an eye out for their video because last release,

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
I don't know if you remember this, Wes, because I can't remember if it was last or if it was this show,

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
but I teased them for not having a very good release video.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
That was our show.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Was it? Yeah.

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
So I teased them, I said, come on guys, when you have a big release like this,

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
you got to up the production a little bit, you got to have a better release video.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
And I said, look, I'll do it for free.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Just ask if you want somebody to do it for you, I'll do it for free.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
So they actually took me up on it.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
No way.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Yeah, so I won't play it, but here's a little...

10:56.000 --> 11:02.000
After a few hard months of work, the KDE community is pleased to announce Plasma 5.8 Long Term Support Edition.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
So you'll have to watch the video to hear the whole thing.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Oh, that's great.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
So they did take me up on it and I thought, all right, fine, I'll record it.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
So I think when they ship it, that'll be in there.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
So go there and watch it and see how it turned out for yourself.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
But I thought, good for them.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
I gave them a razzing and they held me up, they held me accountable.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
Well, it goes to show that they want to appreciate the input and to see the importance.

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
Like, you know, just that little bit of extra work can go a long way in making people excited about your release.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Yeah.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
So that's nice to see.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
Yeah, that's true, and it helps communicate what you've been working so damn hard on.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Exactly.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
Now, speaking of working hard, people are working hard to replace Slack.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Now, don't skip ahead.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
This is actually kind of important if you care about open source software development.

11:42.000 --> 11:48.000
See, Slack has taken a critical role at many prominent open source projects to communicate the team.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
Now, I know you might be skeptical, you might be like, why I got IRC, I got the Telegram, why the hell do I need Slack?

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
I don't want to debate that.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
People have decided for whatever reasons they need it.

11:56.000 --> 12:01.000
And if you work in a professional space, you likely run into Slack.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
How many – are you in a few Slack groups?

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
I'm three at least.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Three?

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Yeah, I'm in three myself as well.

12:07.000 --> 12:13.000
And so this is why I'm always kind of keeping an eye out for something that is open, something that you can self-host,

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
because I would really love to see open source development move over that.

12:18.000 --> 12:23.000
Some projects, you know, they just mailing lists are good enough for us, or we're going to run Rocket Chat.

12:23.000 --> 12:28.000
But a lot of projects, they just don't have the time or the people to run the back-end infrastructure.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
They need something that works, that they can just use, that's free, that they don't have to maintain.

12:31.000 --> 12:37.000
So that's why Riot's kind of interesting, and it's caught TechCrunch's, Mike Butcher's, attention.

12:37.000 --> 12:43.000
And he writes that Riot wants to be like Slack, but with the flexibility of an underlying open source platform.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
We've talked about Matrix before on the show.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
In fact, we've interviewed the guys behind it on the show before.

12:48.000 --> 12:54.000
And Riot, which we've talked about in the past as Vector, we've covered Vector in the past.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Vector.im was their old site.

12:55.000 --> 13:03.000
Has been renamed to Riot, and they are launching like a Slack-like service that is powered by Matrix on the back-end

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
that you can either run on their servers or self-host.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
And it's not bad.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
No.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
It supports Matrix's encryption, so that's kind of nice.

13:12.000 --> 13:19.000
It has end-to-end encryption, as they put it, using Matrix's Malcom? MG Malcom?

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Yeah, I think that's Malcom.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Their type of encryption, I guess.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
And teams can have the flexibility of self-hosting, which is also very nice.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
So this could be big.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
You and I were just quickly experimenting with it this morning.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Yeah, I just got it down on my phone.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Oh, how's the app?

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
I didn't get a chance to play with the mobile app.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
It looks pretty nice.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Yeah, I suspect the mobile app might be nicer than the web app.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
Yeah, it definitely looks like it, but it synced up here nicely.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
It's showing all this.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
Now, the big question is, is the GIF animated on the mobile app?

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Oh, let's see.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
Because it is not animated in the web version, and I've got to have animated GIFs.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Oh, no.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
It doesn't look like it.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
You know, mine was animated in the web version, but it was very inconsistent.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Oh, you know, it's downloading the phone.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
It might have just been a preview here trying to save my bandwidth.

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
Consider yourself either that could be a feature or a downside.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
But I kid, that's super cool to see a real Slack competitor coming.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Yep.

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
And one thing that interests me is I've been looking at Mattermost, looking at Rocketcat again.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
GIFs.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
GIFs.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Sorry.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Yeah, Mattermost is nice too.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
And I like those things, but it's interesting the matrix backend just because if matrix

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
takes off, then this benefits a lot just by that in the bigger ecosystem.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
Matrix already has all kinds of different bridges, Slack bridges, that kind of stuff.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
So if we can see development there, it might benefit all kinds of different clients.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
There's command line clients.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
There's web clients.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
There's this client.

14:31.000 --> 14:36.000
I still – I think I'd have to really speak intelligently about Riot.

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
It was just announced today on TechCrunch – I saw it on TechCrunch – or yesterday.

14:40.000 --> 14:45.000
I would have to try setting it up because that's one of the things about – like

14:45.000 --> 14:50.000
Pope is joking in the chat room, but there legitimately is a snap to set up RocketChat.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
In fact, I think you can even – I think on RocketChat's website, I think they even

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
have like a spin up on DigitalOcean button.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
Yeah, I believe both Docker – I mean both Mattermost and RocketChat have Docker images

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
as well.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
You've got to be really easy.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
That's the thing because Slack is you click one button.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
And in fact, you can do it from your phone even I think.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Right.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
Slack even goes as far as having that beta Linux electron app.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
So yeah, the competition is pretty high.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
Yeah, that's nice too.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
That's nice too.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
And then of course, you have that massive intranstraction which is why we're still

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
talking about Skype to this day.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
It's the same problem.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
And I don't know how you overcome that.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
So it has to be people that know what they want and they have to elect to use it.

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
But maybe they'll have a chance.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
I'll have to check it out too because one big thing for us is like at work for instance,

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
like the Slack charger is a pretty big thing if you want like single sign-on type LDAP

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
integration.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Mattermost, you have to pay for it as well.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
RocketChat has a plug-in for free.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
I'm wondering where they're going to fall in that because a lot of times it seems like

15:41.000 --> 15:46.000
places end up migrating because they need that extra accountability or separation control.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Geez, that could get expensive fast.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Yeah, for sure.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
What were you going to say, William?

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
Go ahead.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Oh, I was going to say they already have the LDAP integration.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
So single sign-on should work if you're doing it through LDAP.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Okay, that's great.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
On the matrix side.

15:57.000 --> 16:01.000
And I think what's also great about this over Mattermost or RocketChat or Slack is that

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
everyone can host their own and it's federated so you can talk to other people's home servers.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
I do like the federation.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Chris could host one.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Wes could host one.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
I could host one.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Yeah.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
We could all be in the same chat and all the messages would get distributed to all the

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
home servers every time someone sends something.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
That sounds kind of fun to try.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
Just like it should be.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
That's super cool because it means you can control all your own data but be a part of

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
someone else's chat without having to go through their server.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
Yeah.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
So William, how much have you played with this?

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
I've been playing with this since May because I wanted to use it as a way to replace Quossel

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
as an IRC client.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
So you were playing with it as Vector?

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Yeah.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Well, I was playing, yeah, as Vector.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
I mean, it's basically still Vector, right?

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
Like they announced the name change but they're still doing all the code through the Vector

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
IAM web client and through the iOS and Android clients.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
They're all the same code base still.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Yeah, that makes sense.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Just a rename.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
So a sound endorsement though, huh?

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
It's been really, really nice.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Yeah, yeah.

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
I've been using the IRC Bridge to connect to IRC and it's been super handy in that way

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
because I like the app much more than I liked Quossel on say iOS.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Oh, sure.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Yeah, I can see that.

16:58.000 --> 17:05.000
So how difficult is it to set up the Vector or now the Riot server?

17:05.000 --> 17:10.000
It was kind of painful for me but I mean I'm already kind of trudging my own way building

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
my own packages and creating my own stuff anyway so everything is kind of painful in

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
that sense.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
It doesn't bother me too much.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
It wasn't like it just deploy on DigitalOcean button or something, huh?

17:20.000 --> 17:27.000
So that doesn't really interest me so I mean I don't have a good opinion on like easy install.

17:27.000 --> 17:33.000
I feel like if I was going to use it in production I would want to build it myself too but if

17:33.000 --> 17:38.000
I want to just try it for a weekend to see if maybe there's a use for it then I'm more

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
inclined to just do an easy setup.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
I mean it's a couple of components, right?

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
So you have like this Node.js thing that is the IRC Bridge connecting to the home server

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
which you also set up and then there's an identity server for handling all the logins

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
that you also have to run.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Microservices.

17:52.000 --> 17:57.000
Yeah, you've got all these microservices and so it is a little weird to get set up the

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
first time.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
That's funny.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Back in my day we called those dependencies.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
That was before JSON was invented, Chris.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
You're so old.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Now, yeah, I know.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
It looks like the chat's trying to tell you there is a Slack bridge too so if you wanted

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
to have Slack conversations in Matrix you could import them in real time.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
Yeah.

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
See that's the thing that I think right there really appeals to me about Riot is on the

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
back end you have all of the capabilities of Matrix.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Like it's inherent WebRTC.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
And you can use whatever client you want.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Yeah.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
Right, exactly.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Yeah, that's another good point.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
You wouldn't have to use the Riot client either.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
I do like the way that sounds.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
And without having to wait for Slack.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
And you could use both simultaneously.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
You could have Riot on your phone and you could use whatever command line client you

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
have on the desktop.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
And if you want to develop your own client.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
Yeah, exactly.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Super flexible.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
All right.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
I think this is the most exciting messaging text so far that we have.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
I am officially hyped.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
I am officially hyped and you managed to get me hyped over something that I think some

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
of the audience probably just snoozes out over like they couldn't care less about this

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
kind of stuff.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
Well, maybe I'll play and try to get my own server set up and some we can check back in

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
in a couple of shows.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Yeah, I think it's mixed.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
I think some people care a lot.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
So yeah, I would be curious to keep following up on it.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Thanks, William.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
That's good hands on information to have.

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
So why don't we take a moment before we stray too far from the self-hosting topic and let's

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
talk about DigitalOcean, our first sponsor this week.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
If you'd like to go spin up a droplet and try out anything that we've been talking about

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
on the show that you can host yourself, use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
It's one word.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
You smush it all together and you can just apply it to your DigitalOcean balance.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
You get a $10 credit.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
Now you can try out their $5 rig two months for free or take advantage of their hourly

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
pricing.

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider that has a freaking great infrastructure all

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
running on top of Linux rigs with SSDs.

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
They use KVM for the virtualizer and then they wrap it in this UI that's so freaking

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
great.

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
If they shipped this as a standalone desktop application, you'd be like, damn, well, that's

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
just a great UI.

19:42.000 --> 19:46.000
But the fact that it's a freaking web page, it works on all my different browsers.

19:46.000 --> 19:52.000
Even on Linux, I can get HTML5 style right in all good console-ness access.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Console goodness in my browser.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
What?

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
I love it and that's really where the secret sauce lies for some things.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
DigitalOcean.com, use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

20:01.000 --> 20:06.000
They got data centers in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, London, Toronto, Germany,

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
India.

20:07.000 --> 20:11.000
I just like that Toronto one because I like to think that my data is close to Alan Jude.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Yeah, right.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Just close.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
He's just there watching over it.

20:14.000 --> 20:20.000
Even if he's not personally there, I feel like perhaps his aura extends around data

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
and it will protect my droplets.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
That's the only reason otherwise Toronto is Canada.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
Come on, right?

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
Who knows what happens up there.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
Use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED and check out that great interface.

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
They're a straightforward API where there's tons of good open source code already written

20:34.000 --> 20:39.000
and they now have high memory droplets where you can get over 200 gigs of RAM on your droplet

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
and like a nuts amount of just SSD storage for days.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
And plus they have high availability block storage.

20:45.000 --> 20:50.000
You can just attach it to your droplet as you need it up to 16 terabytes all backed by SSDs.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
It's super nice.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
They're really hitting that perfect mix where you're like, well, if I want to just try and

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
develop it, maybe I have an idea for a thing.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
And then you get real users and they make it so easy to just take that and instantly

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
scale up and they've got like a real production grade server running or five of them.

21:02.000 --> 21:07.000
And I think this is – I want to stress this point for people that are collaborating over

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
the internet, working with either it's like an open source project or in our case it's

21:11.000 --> 21:17.000
podcast production, having a few tools like a Slack or a Mattermost or Telegram and having

21:17.000 --> 21:21.000
something like DigitalOcean where you can work as a team and you can try things out

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
and people can be spinning up droplets.

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
And because the interface is so straightforward, we all know how the interface works and there's

21:27.000 --> 21:31.000
been times where I'll log my account in right here on a machine and I'll be upstairs testing

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
something and Rekai can come down here and do the things he needs to do right there in

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
the DigitalOcean interface because it's the same interface he uses upstairs.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
It's super easy for the whole team to speak the same language about this stuff.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
It's like the opposite of AWS.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
You don't need to take two courses just to understand it.

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
Really, legitimately, it just helps us get going and just figure stuff out as fast as possible.

21:48.000 --> 21:54.000
So DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED and a big thank you to DigitalOcean

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Over 200 gigs of RAM in a droplet.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
That's nuts.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
That is full on nuts.

22:02.000 --> 22:06.000
So let's get through these updates because we got things to talk about.

22:06.000 --> 22:11.000
But I did mention there is that question, if you log in to an incorrect, if you attempt

22:11.000 --> 22:18.000
to log in to an incorrect SSH server, does your SSH password get revealed?

22:18.000 --> 22:24.000
Now before I reveal the answer, before I tell you what it is, what does somebody in the

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
mumble room want to take a guess?

22:25.000 --> 22:30.000
If you put the wrong IP address into your SSH client and you try to type in your username

22:30.000 --> 22:38.000
and password, could that password be revealed to the SSH server you're connecting to?

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
What do you think?

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
No.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
I mean.

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
I don't think so.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
All right, okay.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Yes, it could.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
Oh!

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
All right, let's go with it.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Here we go.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
Let's see.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
We still have to make sense of the yes or no, right?

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
So here's, basically the answer is yes and here's why.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
And this is over at Stack Exchange.

23:00.000 --> 23:07.000
If you connect to a machine, when you connect to it, the session is encrypted, but what

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
gets essentially sent inside that encrypted session is basically clear text.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
The password that hits the system is inside an encrypted SSH session.

23:14.000 --> 23:19.000
So it's not going over the web or the internet as clear text, but inside that connection

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
it is clear text.

23:20.000 --> 23:26.000
And you could configure PAM if you were evil enough to dump that password to a text file

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
when somebody attempts to log in.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
You'd have to mess.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Or just a fake little service running on port 22 for you.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
Oh, that would do it too, yeah.

23:31.000 --> 23:36.000
But this enables all that PAM magic or LDAP integration or the Yubikey one-time password.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
So they need it in clear text that you can send it to a third-party service to actually

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
verify that it works.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Right.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
But if you had, and I actually had a listener contact me about this.

23:44.000 --> 23:48.000
He's like, I meant to log into one of my local IP addresses, but I fudged a couple of the

23:48.000 --> 23:53.000
numbers or saw I can't remember the details and I connected to a public SSH server that

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
had something listening on 22 and I attempted to log in a few times.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
And he asked me, do they have my username and password now?

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
And after we were looking into it, I had to tell him, you need to change the password

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
because that is a super common IP address that you just accidentally connected to.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
And he totally agreed.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
He's like, yeah, I mean, it's possible they just set it up there.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
And legitimately, if you just configured PAM correctly to spit all this stuff out, it'd

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
just be a real easy poor man's password dump.

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
Log the IP it's from, take that, log back into it.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
This is why you should use a key.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
Yes.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
At least.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
Yes.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Yeah.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
At least a key.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
Yeah.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Go ahead.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
Or take host key verification seriously, at least.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
Yeah.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
That is not one of those options.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
It'll say that the key doesn't match.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
You've never connected to the server before.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Right.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Good point.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Good point.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
You should notice that.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
I think now in this particular listener's case, it was on a brand new machine.

24:39.000 --> 24:44.000
And that could totally happen to me, too, where I don't move my known host file around.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
Yeah.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
I am horrible with this kind of stuff.

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
I really just – because I reload machines so often for reviews that it's really hard

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
to actually stay on top of it.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
And especially then maybe you're spinning up and down a lot of hosts and you end up

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
changing DSS names a lot.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
Oh, yeah.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
Oh, yeah.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
Oh, yeah.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
Yeah.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
It can get confusing really quickly.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
Oh, yeah.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.600
So while we're talking about SSH, Wes has found some magic that claims to be modern

25:03.600 --> 25:06.200
SSH for clusters and teams.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.960
And it's thrown a lot of features in our face.

25:08.960 --> 25:11.400
It says that it has no need for distributed keys.

25:11.400 --> 25:15.440
It can enforce two-factor authentication, including things like Google Authenticator,

25:15.440 --> 25:16.480
I believe.

25:16.480 --> 25:20.840
You have collaboration, so you can actually have shared sessions or support session sharing.

25:20.840 --> 25:23.520
It can record and replay SSA sessions.

25:23.520 --> 25:25.600
And it has cluster introspection.

25:25.600 --> 25:27.040
Now this is where it loses me, Wes.

25:27.040 --> 25:30.680
I don't know what cluster introspection is.

25:30.680 --> 25:35.760
Every teleport node becomes a part of a cluster and is visible on a web UI.

25:35.760 --> 25:38.280
So this is for people that have a lot of systems.

25:38.280 --> 25:39.280
Yes.

25:39.280 --> 25:42.260
And so there's a couple other systems that are comparable to this.

25:42.260 --> 25:44.440
Like Netflix has one called Bless that they use.

25:44.440 --> 25:45.440
It's pretty neat.

25:45.440 --> 25:49.420
They run it in an Amazon Lambda function that basically they use their own certificate authority

25:49.420 --> 25:50.620
for SSH.

25:50.620 --> 25:51.660
Also open source.

25:51.660 --> 25:55.560
Also open source, which is great, and how you can use AWS primitives to build this neat

25:55.560 --> 25:57.040
authentication layer.

25:57.040 --> 26:02.680
And the teleport guys, they run their own private SaaS company offering type thing.

26:02.680 --> 26:05.000
They're just trying to set this up for a lot of big companies.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
There's another one from Facebook that actually have a really great tutorial in the show notes

26:08.000 --> 26:12.120
kind of talking about how to set up your own SSH infrastructure with certificates, how

26:12.120 --> 26:13.120
you can use that.

26:13.120 --> 26:14.120
That is a great article.

26:14.120 --> 26:15.120
It really is a great article.

26:15.120 --> 26:16.120
We have all that linked in the show notes.

26:16.120 --> 26:17.400
And so in your Facebook, you have security people.

26:17.400 --> 26:21.320
You have multitudes of engineers with time on their hands to build you this kind of system.

26:21.320 --> 26:25.600
And the Facebook article, it tells you enough to do it yourself, but it's not all the pieces.

26:25.600 --> 26:26.800
They have some of their own pieces.

26:26.800 --> 26:31.080
How they handle the like, hey, I have my, here's my thing, sign it with your certificate.

26:31.080 --> 26:32.400
That part kind of, you need your own.

26:32.400 --> 26:34.360
So teleport has a solution for you.

26:34.360 --> 26:37.760
You do have to kind of replace some of your SSH daemons and that sort of stuff.

26:37.760 --> 26:40.200
So why would I want a certificate for my SSH login?

26:40.200 --> 26:42.520
Why would I want certificate based SSH logins?

26:42.520 --> 26:44.640
So we've just kind of talked about how passwords are bad.

26:44.640 --> 26:48.760
A lot of people then go to keys, but when you're like an enterprise style organization,

26:48.760 --> 26:50.600
keys can be unwieldy.

26:50.600 --> 26:53.300
You either are rolling your own system to manage the keys and make sure that they're

26:53.300 --> 26:54.520
getting to ship it to the right host.

26:54.520 --> 26:55.680
And when user separates, you have to remove that.

26:55.680 --> 26:56.680
And how secure is that?

26:56.680 --> 26:57.680
Yeah.

26:57.680 --> 26:58.920
How much are you staying on top of that?

26:58.920 --> 27:02.920
And so certificates, you can set it up so that each of your hosts trust a certificate

27:02.920 --> 27:05.640
and then they're looking for something to be signed with that certificate.

27:05.640 --> 27:08.140
But you can also have, they use what's called principles.

27:08.140 --> 27:11.360
And so you can basically, you have your own, your public part of the key, right?

27:11.360 --> 27:15.760
And you give it to them and you can then like maybe do an LDAP check.

27:15.760 --> 27:16.760
I don't know.

27:16.760 --> 27:17.760
It depends on how you do it for the background.

27:17.760 --> 27:22.720
And so then the advantage here is if it's certificate based, then it checks to see if

27:22.720 --> 27:24.200
the cert's valid when I connect.

27:24.200 --> 27:27.680
And so that means as an IT department, I could revoke somebody's access to all my servers

27:27.680 --> 27:30.480
simply by disabling or revoking their certificate.

27:30.480 --> 27:31.480
Exactly.

27:31.480 --> 27:32.480
You can also have it be time bound, right?

27:32.480 --> 27:35.240
So, all right, you can have, you have root on this box, but you have it for the two hours

27:35.240 --> 27:37.440
of your change window and then otherwise no.

27:37.440 --> 27:42.240
And then it can also, you can, when you get that cert signed stuff, you can have it list

27:42.240 --> 27:43.240
the principles.

27:43.240 --> 27:45.080
So you can be like, okay, you're allowed to do root on these hosts and you're allowed

27:45.080 --> 27:46.760
to do this person or those.

27:46.760 --> 27:49.940
And as long as that's set up, that's what they get.

27:49.940 --> 27:52.960
So Teleport provides this as like, if you're not a company that's big enough to make that

27:52.960 --> 27:56.460
infrastructure yourself, but you want auditability, you want to be able to have logs, you want

27:56.460 --> 28:00.440
to have maybe a nice web UI to configure who has access and who doesn't, Teleport gets

28:00.440 --> 28:02.520
that all for you ready to go.

28:02.520 --> 28:03.520
Wow.

28:03.520 --> 28:04.520
And it's all open source?

28:04.520 --> 28:05.520
Yeah.

28:05.520 --> 28:06.520
And so this is maybe like a software option.

28:06.520 --> 28:08.040
Dylan has mentioned a couple like hardware boxes.

28:08.040 --> 28:10.960
This, though, for somebody who even just has like a handful of droplets might actually

28:10.960 --> 28:11.960
be kind of useful.

28:11.960 --> 28:12.960
Yes.

28:12.960 --> 28:13.960
Right?

28:13.960 --> 28:14.960
I mean, especially just, you know, it's all centralized.

28:14.960 --> 28:17.580
I think what they're talking about with like the introspection is you, you know, rather

28:17.580 --> 28:20.360
than just hoping that you have it, you can see, you can make sure all your nodes are

28:20.360 --> 28:21.360
online.

28:21.360 --> 28:23.520
It's a little bit kind of like a, like a chef or a configuration management where you have

28:23.520 --> 28:25.640
a little bit of metadata associated with your whole cluster.

28:25.640 --> 28:26.640
Yeah.

28:26.640 --> 28:27.640
I follow that.

28:27.640 --> 28:28.640
That's kind of nice.

28:28.640 --> 28:30.880
A web UI for my SSH connections.

28:30.880 --> 28:31.880
I don't know.

28:31.880 --> 28:32.960
I thought Mosh was pretty hip.

28:32.960 --> 28:33.960
I thought I was hip with Mosh.

28:33.960 --> 28:37.200
So if you're willing to do a little bit of a, you know, stack change, this might be something

28:37.200 --> 28:40.240
to try out, especially if you kind of building your own little cloud and you want some better

28:40.240 --> 28:41.240
security.

28:41.240 --> 28:44.440
Speaking of building your own little cloud, and I'm busting through these updates because

28:44.440 --> 28:47.840
I want to, I want to get to the gaming stuff.

28:47.840 --> 28:48.840
I'm chewing at the bit.

28:48.840 --> 28:52.560
And plus I just haven't had a chance to talk with Gartner since we were at System76, so

28:52.560 --> 28:54.800
I'm looking, looking forward to that.

28:54.800 --> 28:59.360
But I hinted, oh man, oh, oh man, oh man.

28:59.360 --> 29:03.420
Last week's show, two hint bombs and I don't know how many of you caught the first one.

29:03.420 --> 29:06.120
There was two massive hint bombs in last week's Linux Unplugged.

29:06.120 --> 29:09.640
The first one was about a surprise from the next cloud project that would be announced

29:09.640 --> 29:10.640
in the coming days.

29:10.640 --> 29:12.960
I'm about to reveal what that was right now.

29:12.960 --> 29:18.320
And the second one, and he's not here probably on purpose, is Wimpy got a new job.

29:18.320 --> 29:19.320
Did you hear about this?

29:19.320 --> 29:20.320
Yes I did.

29:20.320 --> 29:21.320
And Ryan totally called it in last week's episode.

29:21.320 --> 29:22.320
Yes he did.

29:22.320 --> 29:23.320
Oh man, he was spot on.

29:23.320 --> 29:27.000
And I felt, and I was like, I downplayed it because like it felt super awkward to be saying

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
that.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
I was like, oh, come on.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.560
And I tried to get Wimpy out of it for him because it was like, it felt awkward.

29:31.560 --> 29:33.200
But he was totally right.

29:33.200 --> 29:35.440
Wimpy is now working at Canonical.

29:35.440 --> 29:36.920
So congratulations to him.

29:36.920 --> 29:37.920
Congrats.

29:37.920 --> 29:38.920
That's great.

29:38.920 --> 29:39.920
He's going to do a lot of good work there.

29:39.920 --> 29:40.920
Congrats.

29:40.920 --> 29:41.920
That's awesome.

29:41.920 --> 29:42.920
It is.

29:42.920 --> 29:44.080
And since he's not here, and I'm going to make him pay for it, I'm going to embarrass

29:44.080 --> 29:46.160
him.

29:46.160 --> 29:49.680
You always watch these companies that are super important to our Linux experience to

29:49.680 --> 29:54.240
see if they're making good decisions, to see when they fumble.

29:54.240 --> 29:57.520
And everybody loves to point to things like Ubuntu TV.

29:57.520 --> 29:58.520
Look what they did there.

29:58.520 --> 30:01.260
They never shipped it.

30:01.260 --> 30:08.360
But rarely do you get to see a company show its cards at how insightful it actually is

30:08.360 --> 30:15.000
into people that have really contributed something solid to open source.

30:15.000 --> 30:20.280
They showed their nimbleness recently when they organized around getting the SnapCraft

30:20.280 --> 30:21.280
sprint and all that stuff.

30:21.280 --> 30:22.280
And they brought people in.

30:22.280 --> 30:24.720
They showed their nimbleness, which seemed clever.

30:24.720 --> 30:29.040
But it didn't necessarily show a ton of insight.

30:29.040 --> 30:36.880
I genuinely believe that by hiring Wimpy, it shows insight that Canonical has into the

30:36.880 --> 30:39.040
people that are contributing in their community.

30:39.040 --> 30:42.920
And really, it's many of the steps they've been taking, with their quick adoption of

30:42.920 --> 30:49.040
Ubuntu Mate as a flavor, with making Wimpy an official Ubuntu contributor and member,

30:49.040 --> 30:51.220
and now with hiring him at Canonical.

30:51.220 --> 30:55.680
And I have a sense, I've spoken with Wimpy, and I have a sense of what his contribution

30:55.680 --> 30:56.680
will be.

30:56.680 --> 30:57.680
And it's brilliant.

30:57.680 --> 31:02.920
It's just absolutely brilliant, and it shows that Canonical isn't so far up in their cloud

31:02.920 --> 31:06.160
strategy heads.

31:06.160 --> 31:09.160
They're not so far up there that they can't come down to the ground level and say, these

31:09.160 --> 31:10.260
people are making a difference.

31:10.260 --> 31:14.120
We should bring them in, give them a paycheck, and utilize their great skills.

31:14.120 --> 31:19.500
And that move that they just made shows that cleverness in a way that I don't think we've

31:19.500 --> 31:21.680
seen out of the company in a while.

31:21.680 --> 31:27.240
I think it also shows a good commitment to, just as much as we've seen Unity 7, Stagnator.

31:27.240 --> 31:29.800
We haven't been necessarily happy with it, and it seems like they've focused a lot on

31:29.800 --> 31:32.200
mobile and there's obviously a big cloud focus.

31:32.200 --> 31:36.520
And so I think it shows that their official support here, them supporting the community

31:36.520 --> 31:40.880
and the clear momentum that Mate has around it and Wimpy, it kind of seems like, yes,

31:40.880 --> 31:45.080
this traditional desktop paradigm, yes, these values, yes, the community who supports those

31:45.080 --> 31:46.960
is still an important aspect to Canonical.

31:46.960 --> 31:51.500
And just like when ByteMark became an infrastructure sponsor for the project and they said, these

31:51.500 --> 31:54.920
are one of the things that happen that make a distribution in it for the long haul that

31:54.920 --> 31:59.480
you can count on maybe another decade or generations of releases.

31:59.480 --> 32:02.600
This too, this is a move because it's not like Wimpy hasn't had a day job already.

32:02.600 --> 32:03.760
He's had a day job.

32:03.760 --> 32:06.300
He's been maintaining Ubuntu Mate while he has a day job.

32:06.300 --> 32:09.760
Now his day job is going to be more directly aligned with supporting that project.

32:09.760 --> 32:14.240
Not directly, but obviously if you're sitting there speaking with Canonical staff every

32:14.240 --> 32:18.280
single day and you're working on Canonical projects and you have direct insight on the

32:18.280 --> 32:22.920
direction of where it's going, you are in a much better position to maintain a flavor

32:22.920 --> 32:24.860
of Ubuntu.

32:24.860 --> 32:25.860
It's obvious.

32:25.860 --> 32:31.320
So it's a huge win for Ubuntu Mate users too, which are growing rapidly.

32:31.320 --> 32:33.080
So there you go.

32:33.080 --> 32:39.880
And I think it's Popi Jhampi, yeah, Popi mentions that they do have openings at Canonical.

32:39.880 --> 32:41.680
Yeah, there's quite a few here.

32:41.680 --> 32:43.160
Oh, maybe they're just desperate then.

32:43.160 --> 32:44.160
I don't know.

32:44.160 --> 32:49.320
All right, so this was what I, that was hinted later in the show last week.

32:49.320 --> 32:53.120
Earlier in the show I hinted that Nextcloud had a surprise for us and here it is.

32:53.120 --> 32:58.520
With the Nextcloud box, and I think this is kind of clever because it is inside a box,

32:58.520 --> 33:02.560
in the box for the Nextcloud box, you get a one terabyte USB 3 hard drive from Western

33:02.560 --> 33:07.760
Digital, you get the Nextcloud case with room for a drive and a board, you get a micro USB

33:07.760 --> 33:12.400
charger, cable and adapters and a screwdriver and screws, you get a micro SD card loaded

33:12.400 --> 33:19.600
with snappy Ubuntu core, and you get Nextcloud 10 pre-installed with Apache and MySQL configured.

33:19.600 --> 33:23.720
But what you don't get is the compute board, you supply that yourself.

33:23.720 --> 33:27.400
The box is compatible with the Raspberry Pi 2, which you need to supply.

33:27.400 --> 33:30.440
The box can also fit the Raspberry Pi 3 and the Odroid C2.

33:30.440 --> 33:32.240
Just go with 3, why would you use that?

33:32.240 --> 33:33.880
I know, I know, right?

33:33.880 --> 33:37.640
And I kind of, I don't know how much it is because I have been traveling so I didn't

33:37.640 --> 33:39.480
get a chance to look after they announced it.

33:39.480 --> 33:40.480
What's the C right here?

33:40.480 --> 33:43.920
I want either, I either want to pick one up or I'm going to ask Josh if he'll send me

33:43.920 --> 33:44.920
a review unit.

33:44.920 --> 33:45.920
Looks like it's like 80 bucks, US.

33:45.920 --> 33:47.440
I think I might just buy one then.

33:47.440 --> 33:49.440
Yeah, that seems actually pretty neat.

33:49.440 --> 33:51.360
Yeah, I would like to try it out.

33:51.360 --> 33:53.040
I would like to really try that out.

33:53.040 --> 33:56.680
I would like more storage but it's a good starting place and it's a good way to introduce

33:56.680 --> 34:02.400
people to Nextcloud and Nextcloud supports online storage options too.

34:02.400 --> 34:05.160
So if you got to grow, that's a solid option.

34:05.160 --> 34:08.020
So that seems like a nice little place for hobbyists to kind of get it.

34:08.020 --> 34:10.760
Maybe you're not that interested in having it run on a cloud droplet or whatever and

34:10.760 --> 34:14.520
you just kind of want something to sit by your TV or sit in the basement somewhere.

34:14.520 --> 34:21.880
I think too, 80 bucks isn't going to break the bank for some and if you have some investment

34:21.880 --> 34:27.280
in Nextcloud as an ongoing open source project, probably not a bad way to not just throw a

34:27.280 --> 34:32.600
little money towards Nextcloud but also to validate to hardware partners that Nextcloud

34:32.600 --> 34:37.240
was worth their time and that might be the bigger long term benefit that we as a community

34:37.240 --> 34:41.760
could do here is if we pick this thing up, it shows Western Digital and it shows everybody

34:41.760 --> 34:45.680
that's involved with this, all the hardware partners that, hey, this company actually

34:45.680 --> 34:46.680
shipped some orders.

34:46.680 --> 34:47.680
We should pay attention to them.

34:47.680 --> 34:50.600
Wouldn't that be great if we could kind of set those up to facilitate those kinds of

34:50.600 --> 34:51.600
partnerships?

34:51.600 --> 34:52.600
Right, because what happens next?

34:52.600 --> 34:53.600
What happens next?

34:53.600 --> 34:55.360
And the conversation is, well, what is it about this people like?

34:55.360 --> 34:57.200
Well, it's got this Nextcloud thing on it.

34:57.200 --> 34:58.920
Well, what's so great about Nextcloud?

34:58.920 --> 35:02.440
Well then the answer to that is, well, you get the control of your own data and it's

35:02.440 --> 35:06.900
not on a hosted service and wouldn't that be a great conversation for all these companies

35:06.900 --> 35:07.900
to start having?

35:07.900 --> 35:08.900
Yes.

35:08.900 --> 35:09.900
Like I'm fine with embracing a hardware provider.

35:09.900 --> 35:13.840
You know, maybe they have great hardware, but I don't want to use their weird half-supported

35:13.840 --> 35:14.880
proprietary platform.

35:14.880 --> 35:17.880
So if they can partner with someone that has open source support, that would be amazing.

35:17.880 --> 35:21.680
And then you could see, I mean, it could start Western, you know, this could lead to something

35:21.680 --> 35:26.120
like where companies like Western Digital, instead of having their Western Digital, Mybook,

35:26.120 --> 35:31.760
Mycloud proprietary old version of Linux, it could simply be running a more modern version

35:31.760 --> 35:34.800
of Snappy Core with Nextcloud running on top of it.

35:34.800 --> 35:39.880
And imagine for a moment if multiple vendors started doing this.

35:39.880 --> 35:46.720
So then they started competing on hardware and RAID features and the software to manage

35:46.720 --> 35:50.200
it all and the interface and all that stuff was in the Nextcloud level.

35:50.200 --> 35:51.200
And it was just something to be...

35:51.200 --> 35:52.200
One upstream.

35:52.200 --> 35:53.200
Yeah.

35:53.200 --> 35:54.200
Oh, man.

35:54.200 --> 35:55.200
I don't know.

35:55.200 --> 35:56.200
That's putting the cart way ahead of the horse.

35:56.200 --> 36:00.760
But yeah, it seems like if this goes well, that's the kind of thing that could follow

36:00.760 --> 36:01.760
years down the road.

36:01.760 --> 36:02.760
Exactly.

36:02.760 --> 36:03.760
Building a platform.

36:03.760 --> 36:04.760
That's pretty cool.

36:04.760 --> 36:06.760
Yeah, building a platform.

36:06.760 --> 36:11.560
I'm following Flatpak and SnapCraft and Snappy snap package news all the time and there's

36:11.560 --> 36:15.720
a new version of the SnapCraft GUI, which I don't know how much we've talked about.

36:15.720 --> 36:18.080
And it seems like it's a pretty big deal to me.

36:18.080 --> 36:20.720
The SnapCraft GUI is just what you would expect.

36:20.720 --> 36:26.800
It's a graphical interface to create snap packages, which it's not the snap packages

36:26.800 --> 36:28.600
are hard to make in the first place.

36:28.600 --> 36:30.800
And there's already been a command line tool to do this.

36:30.800 --> 36:35.280
But this is there's going to be a version two of the SnapCraft GUI shipping soon.

36:35.280 --> 36:36.640
And it kind of is bad ass.

36:36.640 --> 36:39.920
Also, I don't see a lot of unity desktops with the with the launcher at the bottom.

36:39.920 --> 36:40.920
No, I don't see that.

36:40.920 --> 36:44.960
Yeah, it is kind of it is kind of I should have tried that like a purple Windows 10.

36:44.960 --> 36:45.960
But without all the tiles.

36:45.960 --> 36:47.000
Now I hate it.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
Now I hate it.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
All right.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
Geez.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
Sorry, everyone.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
God.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
Damn it.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
Damn it.

36:54.000 --> 37:00.500
And I was all happy that it does seem like a big thing, especially for like, you know,

37:00.500 --> 37:03.680
you make a Windows app, you have Linux users telling you they want it.

37:03.680 --> 37:04.680
You're trying to figure it out.

37:04.680 --> 37:07.560
And suddenly you're like miles deep and make files and in the command line.

37:07.560 --> 37:10.720
So if this can help you package your app in an easy way that lets Linux users consume

37:10.720 --> 37:11.720
it then totally great.

37:11.720 --> 37:12.720
Yep.

37:12.720 --> 37:18.620
I I've I've heard many, many complaints at Koda radio at Jupiter broadcasting.com at

37:18.620 --> 37:19.620
Michael Dominic.

37:19.620 --> 37:22.480
Boy, the people get out there writing these emails saying like, I got all excited after

37:22.480 --> 37:24.360
hearing the show about starting Linux development.

37:24.360 --> 37:27.000
And then I spent three days trying to figure out how to deliver an application on Linux

37:27.000 --> 37:29.560
and I gave up and went back to the app store.

37:29.560 --> 37:30.560
Yeah.

37:30.560 --> 37:31.560
Oh, no.

37:31.560 --> 37:32.560
So close.

37:32.560 --> 37:33.560
Don't go.

37:33.560 --> 37:34.560
Don't go.

37:34.560 --> 37:35.560
Yeah.

37:35.560 --> 37:36.560
We'll use it.

37:36.560 --> 37:37.560
We just have some weird requirements.

37:37.560 --> 37:42.760
Oh, and Poby points out in the chat room that SnapCraft is a community maintained effort,

37:42.760 --> 37:43.760
which is really kind of awesome.

37:43.760 --> 37:44.760
That is awesome.

37:44.760 --> 37:45.760
Yeah.

37:45.760 --> 37:46.760
I hadn't really hadn't really thought about mentioning that.

37:46.760 --> 37:49.960
But that is that does actually show some serious investment from the community that looks like

37:49.960 --> 37:53.200
a gives a sense of that people are really liking this platform.

37:53.200 --> 37:54.880
It's a QT based application, too.

37:54.880 --> 37:56.320
So all right.

37:56.320 --> 37:58.360
So let's let's we've been here for a little bit.

37:58.360 --> 37:59.360
We have let's see.

37:59.360 --> 38:00.360
What word do we have?

38:00.360 --> 38:01.360
Oh, yeah.

38:01.360 --> 38:02.360
Oh, yes.

38:02.360 --> 38:03.360
Oh, good.

38:03.360 --> 38:04.360
Oh, good.

38:04.360 --> 38:05.360
Good.

38:05.360 --> 38:06.360
We finally get to we finally get to the point of the show that I've been waiting for all

38:06.360 --> 38:07.360
episode.

38:07.360 --> 38:09.360
Let's take this moment then to thank Ting.

38:09.360 --> 38:12.640
Everybody, if you do me a favor and go to Linux dot ting dot com, you can support this

38:12.640 --> 38:16.720
show and you learn more about Ting and you also get twenty five dollars off your device.

38:16.720 --> 38:18.920
Or if you bring one, you'll get twenty five dollars in service credit.

38:18.920 --> 38:20.600
Now, this is why I'm recommending.

38:20.600 --> 38:24.160
So it's first full disclosure, more than two and a half.

38:24.160 --> 38:26.920
I mean, it's gosh, I guess this year is.

38:26.920 --> 38:27.920
Wow.

38:27.920 --> 38:29.520
I'm like I'm like two years.

38:29.520 --> 38:30.640
I'm like way over.

38:30.640 --> 38:31.640
Way over two years now.

38:31.640 --> 38:32.640
It's been it's been a while.

38:32.640 --> 38:37.780
And I every time I think to myself, what is it about Ting now that I like?

38:37.780 --> 38:41.440
Because as I started using the things that initially blew me away were the price.

38:41.440 --> 38:43.520
It's six dollars for my line and then I pay for what I use.

38:43.520 --> 38:48.800
And if I use Wi-Fi for most of my downloads, my big phone usage, honestly, is if I'm not

38:48.800 --> 38:52.680
on Wi-Fi, it's when I'm driving and I don't like to really do a lot of text messaging

38:52.680 --> 38:54.200
or a lot of stuff when I'm driving anyway.

38:54.200 --> 39:00.600
So I just pre-download my podcast and my data, my data connection on Ting is is really handy.

39:00.600 --> 39:01.600
It's a great backup.

39:01.600 --> 39:06.120
And where I am, where I'm at here at the studio, we get like, are you on CDMA or GSM on that

39:06.120 --> 39:07.120
phone?

39:07.120 --> 39:08.120
GSM.

39:08.120 --> 39:09.120
Have you ran the speed test here at the studio?

39:09.120 --> 39:10.120
No.

39:10.120 --> 39:11.120
You should turn off your Wi-Fi and run it.

39:11.120 --> 39:13.120
It's like twenty two, twenty three, twenty four megabits.

39:13.120 --> 39:14.120
Wow.

39:14.120 --> 39:15.120
It's really nice.

39:15.120 --> 39:18.280
So you can the nice thing about Ting is they have two cellular networks, CDMA and GSM,

39:18.280 --> 39:21.520
and you can pick whichever works better for you in your area.

39:21.520 --> 39:25.120
And some places here in Washington, because we have a lot of hills and a lot of trees,

39:25.120 --> 39:26.920
CDMA legitimately works better.

39:26.920 --> 39:29.200
Might not be super fast, but at least you have service.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.200
Right.

39:30.200 --> 39:31.200
But here in town, we're at the studio.

39:31.200 --> 39:33.460
GSM is rock solid fast.

39:33.460 --> 39:38.840
And it's so solid that Alan was in studio for a special tech snap episode a couple of

39:38.840 --> 39:40.240
years ago.

39:40.240 --> 39:41.240
And like, when does that happen?

39:41.240 --> 39:42.240
No, never.

39:42.240 --> 39:43.240
That's rare.

39:43.240 --> 39:44.240
Twice.

39:44.240 --> 39:45.240
Yeah.

39:45.240 --> 39:46.240
Three times ever in the history of the show.

39:46.240 --> 39:47.240
And of course, our Internet was out.

39:47.240 --> 39:49.760
And it's not like he's not like we could reschedule that episode.

39:49.760 --> 39:52.160
I'll just like, you know, book your flight again.

39:52.160 --> 39:53.160
It's fine.

39:53.160 --> 39:57.400
So we set up the Ting hotspot on my phone, which is, you know, is just a checkbox in

39:57.400 --> 39:58.400
Android.

39:58.400 --> 39:59.400
There's no extra fees.

39:59.400 --> 40:00.400
You must authorize with your carrier.

40:00.400 --> 40:01.400
None of that bull crap.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.960
And it just turns on and we used it for a couple of hours.

40:03.960 --> 40:04.960
It saved the day.

40:04.960 --> 40:05.960
It was really nice.

40:05.960 --> 40:08.400
And the flexibility like that is what's really great about Ting.

40:08.400 --> 40:12.600
And I'll also mention that if you're a Nexus phone user, they have some great tips on their

40:12.600 --> 40:16.400
blog right now on ways you can save with Wi-Fi assist.

40:16.400 --> 40:17.520
So I'll link you up to that.

40:17.520 --> 40:20.400
We've also got articles up there about bringing the iPhone 7 to Ting.

40:20.400 --> 40:24.480
So start right now by going to linux.ting.com.

40:24.480 --> 40:25.720
Try out their savings calculator.

40:25.720 --> 40:32.320
And a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program, linux.ting.com.

40:32.320 --> 40:33.320
That's how they say it.

40:33.320 --> 40:34.320
That's exactly how they say it.

40:34.320 --> 40:35.320
No, that's how Yahoo says it.

40:35.320 --> 40:36.320
I apologize.

40:36.320 --> 40:37.320
I apologize.

40:37.320 --> 40:38.320
Yahoo's done a thing anymore, Chris.

40:38.320 --> 40:39.320
Oh!

40:39.320 --> 40:40.320
No, too soon.

40:40.320 --> 40:41.320
That's sad.

40:41.320 --> 40:42.320
Too soon.

40:42.320 --> 40:43.640
So Gardner is joining us in the mumble room.

40:43.640 --> 40:47.040
He is the Linux gamer on YouTube and on the Twitter.

40:47.040 --> 40:49.200
Gardner, welcome to Linux Unplugged, sir.

40:49.200 --> 40:51.080
Hey, I'm glad to be here.

40:51.080 --> 40:55.520
So would it be embarrassing for you or would it be okay if I played your channel trailer

40:55.520 --> 40:58.560
to introduce people to you who are not familiar with you?

40:58.560 --> 41:01.400
Because I know for me, it's hard to watch my own stuff.

41:01.400 --> 41:04.040
But I thought actually your trailer would be probably a good way to just kind of introduce

41:04.040 --> 41:05.040
people to you.

41:05.040 --> 41:06.040
Are you cool with that?

41:06.040 --> 41:07.040
Oh, absolutely.

41:07.040 --> 41:08.040
Okay.

41:08.040 --> 41:09.040
Yeah, it's a good trailer.

41:09.040 --> 41:11.600
You wouldn't use a hammer like this.

41:11.600 --> 41:16.560
So why would you play PC games like this?

41:16.560 --> 41:21.800
Sure, you might accomplish what you're trying to do, but there's a much easier way.

41:21.800 --> 41:24.840
The answer to your PC gaming woes is Linux.

41:24.840 --> 41:28.000
Hi, I'm the Linux Gamer and this is my channel.

41:28.000 --> 41:33.160
I produce weekly reviews of Linux and SteamOS games, titles you can buy from the Humble

41:33.160 --> 41:34.880
Store, GOG, and Steam.

41:34.880 --> 41:40.320
I also make informational videos, do product unboxings, create informative tutorials, produce

41:40.320 --> 41:42.640
hilarious let's plays, and a whole lot more.

41:42.640 --> 41:44.880
Please take a moment and check out some of my stuff.

41:44.880 --> 41:48.320
And if you're intrigued by what you see, you can mash that subscribe button.

41:48.320 --> 41:51.960
I'm the Linux Gamer and there's a better way to PC game.

41:51.960 --> 41:54.560
So I don't know how hilarious my let's plays are, but okay.

41:54.560 --> 41:57.040
Well, I did like the goat one.

41:57.040 --> 41:58.040
What was that?

41:58.040 --> 41:59.040
I forget now the name of that.

41:59.040 --> 42:00.040
Goat Simulator.

42:00.040 --> 42:01.720
Yeah, that one's pretty good.

42:01.720 --> 42:05.880
So Gardiner, why Linux gaming?

42:05.880 --> 42:06.880
And are you crazy?

42:06.880 --> 42:08.840
I mean, there's no games for Linux.

42:08.840 --> 42:10.720
That's impossible.

42:10.720 --> 42:13.320
I hear that all the time in my comments and I don't listen to them.

42:13.320 --> 42:14.320
Yeah, I bet you do.

42:14.320 --> 42:15.320
Yeah.

42:15.320 --> 42:16.320
Yeah.

42:16.320 --> 42:17.320
I mean, why YouTube, too?

42:17.320 --> 42:18.320
That is...

42:18.320 --> 42:19.320
I mean, so not that...

42:19.320 --> 42:20.320
I mean, we publish to YouTube, too.

42:20.320 --> 42:22.560
I have no problem with YouTube, but it's not necessarily known as the most Linux friendly

42:22.560 --> 42:23.560
place.

42:23.560 --> 42:28.160
Well, if I'm going to be totally honest, I think of my channel as a gaming channel first

42:28.160 --> 42:30.280
and I just happen to play games on Linux.

42:30.280 --> 42:31.280
I like that.

42:31.280 --> 42:32.280
Interesting, yeah.

42:32.280 --> 42:33.280
That does make sense.

42:33.280 --> 42:34.280
And what do you...

42:34.280 --> 42:36.160
Do you do all of the production on Linux for your setup?

42:36.160 --> 42:37.160
Yeah, I do.

42:37.160 --> 42:42.200
I use a AVerMedia capture card that captures to SD to capture all my video.

42:42.200 --> 42:43.440
I edit on a Linux rig.

42:43.440 --> 42:46.160
I use Ubuntu and I edit with Kdenlive.

42:46.160 --> 42:47.160
Okay.

42:47.160 --> 42:48.320
Hey, that's awesome.

42:48.320 --> 42:49.320
And you...

42:49.320 --> 42:50.320
But you also have a day job, too.

42:50.320 --> 42:51.840
So you're doing this as like a...

42:51.840 --> 42:52.840
Is it a...

42:52.840 --> 42:56.400
It's not even fair to really call it a side project because it's more than that.

42:56.400 --> 42:58.320
How is that working out for you?

42:58.320 --> 42:59.320
It's a passion project.

42:59.320 --> 43:04.880
I really, really enjoy gaming and the reason I started my channel was kind of twofold.

43:04.880 --> 43:09.280
The first thing was that I didn't think I played enough games, so I wanted an excuse

43:09.280 --> 43:10.280
to play more.

43:10.280 --> 43:12.280
I understand.

43:12.280 --> 43:17.880
And the other reason was I wanted to feel like I was doing something with my life.

43:17.880 --> 43:18.880
Sure.

43:18.880 --> 43:19.880
We've all been there.

43:19.880 --> 43:20.880
Yeah.

43:20.880 --> 43:24.880
It's a passion project for me and I really enjoy everything that I have gotten to do

43:24.880 --> 43:27.860
so far and hope it can expand in the future.

43:27.860 --> 43:31.960
So as we record the episode, he has 11,000 subscribers, which is really a great number

43:31.960 --> 43:35.080
on YouTube for Linux-focused content like that.

43:35.080 --> 43:37.120
And that takes a long time to build up.

43:37.120 --> 43:41.600
I mean, that's a big commitment of a lot of releases.

43:41.600 --> 43:47.560
I'm looking at your channel right now, Gardner, and it looks like, YouTube doesn't tell me,

43:47.560 --> 43:49.240
but I mean, thousands of videos.

43:49.240 --> 43:50.240
How many videos?

43:50.240 --> 43:52.920
Do you have an idea that you've posted over on YouTube?

43:52.920 --> 43:56.900
So I post some for my Patreon subscribers that are private, but I think I have something

43:56.900 --> 43:57.900
like 110 or 140.

43:57.900 --> 43:58.900
Geez.

43:58.900 --> 43:59.900
Somewhere in there.

43:59.900 --> 44:00.900
Yeah.

44:00.900 --> 44:01.900
I've been doing it for about, sorry.

44:01.900 --> 44:02.900
No, go ahead.

44:02.900 --> 44:03.900
I was going to say, so what?

44:03.900 --> 44:05.400
That's what, a few years at least you've been doing it?

44:05.400 --> 44:06.400
Yeah.

44:06.400 --> 44:09.640
I started my channel actually two years ago, almost to the day.

44:09.640 --> 44:10.640
Wow.

44:10.640 --> 44:11.640
So congratulations.

44:11.640 --> 44:12.640
Happy birthday.

44:12.640 --> 44:13.640
Wow.

44:13.640 --> 44:14.640
Yeah, that's wonderful.

44:14.640 --> 44:15.640
Happy YouTube birthday.

44:15.640 --> 44:20.240
So I kind of wanted to get a picture of life for Gardner.

44:20.240 --> 44:22.080
Where are you based out of?

44:22.080 --> 44:23.560
I live in Maine.

44:23.560 --> 44:24.560
Oh.

44:24.560 --> 44:25.920
The opposite end is over here.

44:25.920 --> 44:27.120
The beard's from Maine.

44:27.120 --> 44:29.460
So yeah, that's very interesting.

44:29.460 --> 44:33.480
And so you have the day job, and then you do production on the weekends?

44:33.480 --> 44:34.480
Do you do it at evening?

44:34.480 --> 44:37.480
Are you up late working on this thing?

44:37.480 --> 44:43.320
Most of the time I do my editing on a Monday, typically.

44:43.320 --> 44:49.720
And then I work on recording the video and writing the scripts on weeknights after work.

44:49.720 --> 44:53.940
And how much time do you have to spend ever fiddling with things to get the game to work

44:53.940 --> 44:54.940
under Linux?

44:54.940 --> 44:55.940
Has that been a problem?

44:55.940 --> 44:57.760
Or are you for the most part be able to install these things and they just work because you've

44:57.760 --> 45:01.840
probably tried more games than most people?

45:01.840 --> 45:07.080
Typically I don't like to review games that require a lot of work because of who I'm kind

45:07.080 --> 45:13.000
of targeting on YouTube, but there are some games that have had more headaches than they're

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
worth.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
Yeah, that makes sense.

45:15.000 --> 45:18.640
All right, so we've got some new games that have come out recently that I want to talk

45:18.640 --> 45:22.920
about in a moment, but if anybody in the Bumba Room has any questions for Gardner, go ahead

45:22.920 --> 45:27.160
because I don't want to dominate, or Wes if you have any questions, but I think one of

45:27.160 --> 45:32.680
the things that we've all kind of discussed recently is the big games that have been announced,

45:32.680 --> 45:34.800
some of the big releases.

45:34.800 --> 45:39.200
There's though some independent games that are coming out soon that I want to talk about,

45:39.200 --> 45:40.760
but there is some rumors too.

45:40.760 --> 45:44.240
So why don't we start with the rumors, then we'll get into the confirmed releases.

45:44.240 --> 45:48.920
Now one of the resources that people are probably familiar with is there is a subreddit for

45:48.920 --> 45:51.360
gaming, gaming on Linux, is that what it is?

45:51.360 --> 45:52.360
What is the subreddit?

45:52.360 --> 45:56.280
Because I just saw, I was just, go ahead Gardner, you probably know what it is.

45:56.280 --> 45:57.760
Linux underscore gaming, is that what it is?

45:57.760 --> 45:58.760
Linux underscore gaming?

45:58.760 --> 45:59.760
Yeah, it's Linux underscore gaming.

45:59.760 --> 46:00.760
Yeah, okay.

46:00.760 --> 46:04.760
So this is not a bad resource for Linux gaming news, and gaming on Linux is another one.

46:04.760 --> 46:08.680
Gardner, what are some of your favorite resources for learning news about Linux, besides your

46:08.680 --> 46:10.720
Twitter feed?

46:10.720 --> 46:17.140
I like gamingonlinux.com, and I actually go to OMG Ubuntu quite a bit, but the Linux gaming

46:17.140 --> 46:18.840
subreddit is one of my favorite places.

46:18.840 --> 46:23.880
All right, so this was in the Linux gaming subreddit, and it's tagged as speculation,

46:23.880 --> 46:28.920
so take it with some grain of salt, but 21 hours ago they posted that Star Citizen may

46:28.920 --> 46:34.840
be confirmed for Linux as the dev was doing a coding streaming session, and in the IDE

46:34.840 --> 46:38.500
here you can see something tagged Linux launcher.

46:38.500 --> 46:40.680
Did you happen to catch this one, Gardner?

46:40.680 --> 46:42.120
I actually didn't see this one.

46:42.120 --> 46:46.400
Now, I don't think it's shocking that there's going to be a Star Citizen for Linux.

46:46.400 --> 46:51.080
Google even, I just Googled Star Citizen, says it's an upcoming space sim game for Microsoft

46:51.080 --> 46:52.080
Windows and Linux.

46:52.080 --> 46:57.180
Yeah, that's not the shocking part, but they're really, they've been super dodgy about when

46:57.180 --> 47:00.880
we'd see it and how far along it is for a long time now, and people have been getting

47:00.880 --> 47:01.880
a little concerned.

47:01.880 --> 47:02.880
That's sort of been my sense of it.

47:02.880 --> 47:06.520
There's been that history of like, well, okay, you say it's happening, my Windows friends

47:06.520 --> 47:08.440
are going to be playing it, I want to play it.

47:08.440 --> 47:13.840
But that could be, so that's in the rumor category, but there is some big games that

47:13.840 --> 47:16.680
people are looking forward to that we're going to mention, we're going to talk about.

47:16.680 --> 47:21.040
So quickly, let's mention Linux Academy at linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, go there

47:21.040 --> 47:23.520
to learn more about the Linux Academy platform.

47:23.520 --> 47:26.600
This is where they teach you everything you need to know about the basics of Linux, the

47:26.600 --> 47:29.760
advanced topics, and all the stuff that runs on top of it.

47:29.760 --> 47:30.760
Which is everything.

47:30.760 --> 47:31.760
Yeah, really.

47:31.760 --> 47:35.080
And they have instructor mentoring available, downloadable comprehensive study guides.

47:35.080 --> 47:37.080
They have a great community.

47:37.080 --> 47:40.800
They have people working around the clock to make Linux Academy better all the time,

47:40.800 --> 47:43.880
so that way your subscription constantly gets value.

47:43.880 --> 47:48.880
I also mention, I will just briefly say that they have some great news, Linux Academy students

47:48.880 --> 47:54.120
can now make their profile public and share their credentials and their professional certs.

47:54.120 --> 47:56.840
So when you're getting a gig, you can link that in your resume.

47:56.840 --> 48:00.980
See, that actually, I know there's a lot of organizations that will let you use their

48:00.980 --> 48:04.240
company account for this, so if you can come in as an applicant and just be like, well

48:04.240 --> 48:06.960
look, you were going to have me do this if I'm hired, I've already done these three things,

48:06.960 --> 48:08.240
you should probably hire me.

48:08.240 --> 48:11.960
And one of the great things is Linux Academy has just been growing more and more and more

48:11.960 --> 48:12.960
in notoriety.

48:12.960 --> 48:16.120
So Linux Academy's being a staff, they've worked a lot with the Linux Foundation, so

48:16.120 --> 48:18.840
in a professional space, they're becoming a well-known name.

48:18.840 --> 48:21.680
And so that's a great feature just at the right time.

48:21.680 --> 48:23.840
So my hat's off to them, and I wanted to give them a shout out.

48:23.840 --> 48:24.840
I'd like you to learn more.

48:24.840 --> 48:28.780
If you go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, you support the show, you can check out their

48:28.780 --> 48:30.680
features page, and I'll have a video for you there.

48:30.680 --> 48:33.440
If there's topics we've talked about that have been over your head at all, this might

48:33.440 --> 48:38.080
be a great resource to learn more, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

48:38.080 --> 48:41.580
Thanks to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

48:41.580 --> 48:46.720
So this came out just a couple of days ago, and I'm going to say it's pronounced Deus

48:46.720 --> 48:47.720
Ex.

48:47.720 --> 48:48.720
How's that?

48:48.720 --> 48:49.720
How's that?

48:49.720 --> 48:50.720
I think that's beautiful.

48:50.720 --> 48:51.720
Yeah, I know Deus Ex.

48:51.720 --> 48:56.040
Deus Ex is coming to Mac and Linux this year, and that's big news.

48:56.040 --> 48:57.160
Everybody's talking about it.

48:57.160 --> 48:59.040
I saw you tweeted about it, Gardiner.

48:59.040 --> 49:00.040
Why is this big news?

49:00.040 --> 49:03.120
I'm not familiar with the franchise.

49:03.120 --> 49:06.120
Deus Ex, the franchise actually started in, I think it was like 1989.

49:06.120 --> 49:07.120
Forever ago.

49:07.120 --> 49:08.120
Yeah.

49:08.120 --> 49:09.120
Yeah.

49:09.120 --> 49:10.120
And it was, what's his name?

49:10.120 --> 49:11.120
Warren...

49:11.120 --> 49:12.120
Warren Spector.

49:12.120 --> 49:13.120
Yeah, Warren Spector.

49:13.120 --> 49:14.120
That's it.

49:14.120 --> 49:20.000
And he's a big name in the gaming world, and I think I played the original Deus Ex, and

49:20.000 --> 49:24.240
it was really interesting, and it was like a pioneer of storytelling.

49:24.240 --> 49:31.200
And the previous game to this incarnation of Deus Ex was really well received.

49:31.200 --> 49:35.680
So it's kind of big news that Deus Ex Mankind Divided is coming to Linux.

49:35.680 --> 49:40.640
Yeah, and I guess it's already out for Windows, and it's kind of got a mixed review, at least

49:40.640 --> 49:41.640
according to Steam.

49:41.640 --> 49:47.160
It's got a, kind of like a, not a fully loved product, but people still seem to be pretty

49:47.160 --> 49:48.160
excited on the Linux side.

49:48.160 --> 49:51.320
I saw a lot of Linux press for it.

49:51.320 --> 49:54.800
And the graphics look incredible, but that's all my, that's really the extent of my excitement

49:54.800 --> 49:56.360
about it.

49:56.360 --> 49:59.200
I assume though that you yourself will probably be getting it on release day.

49:59.200 --> 50:00.200
The world apart.

50:00.200 --> 50:01.200
Probably.

50:01.200 --> 50:02.200
Yeah.

50:02.200 --> 50:03.200
The trailer looks good.

50:03.200 --> 50:06.040
I'd like to get a release, an early release, but I don't know.

50:06.040 --> 50:08.560
Have people been working with you on that?

50:08.560 --> 50:09.560
Some people.

50:09.560 --> 50:10.560
Feral's pretty good about it.

50:10.560 --> 50:12.440
Ah, it depends on the shop, huh?

50:12.440 --> 50:13.440
I see.

50:13.440 --> 50:14.440
Yeah, that makes sense.

50:14.440 --> 50:19.480
So, just a hint, hint, nudge, nudge, but speaking of OMG Ubuntu, they, well we were speaking

50:19.480 --> 50:22.000
of them, they have the game that I'm really the most excited about.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.840
This is the one I've been waiting to talk about all episode.

50:24.840 --> 50:30.600
I don't know what it is about me and space shooters, but Everspace is going to hit Linux

50:30.600 --> 50:33.600
later this month as early access, I believe.

50:33.600 --> 50:34.600
So keep that in mind.

50:34.600 --> 50:36.640
I don't think it's a finished product yet.

50:36.640 --> 50:39.520
Holy scrumptious space shooter though.

50:39.520 --> 50:45.840
This looks like I could spend an evening just totally set, get my food, get my snacks, get

50:45.840 --> 50:46.840
myself a beverage.

50:46.840 --> 50:47.840
Oh man.

50:47.840 --> 50:48.840
And stare at my screen.

50:48.840 --> 50:49.840
Can I come over for this?

50:49.840 --> 50:51.240
Yeah, it looks really good.

50:51.240 --> 50:53.120
How would you describe these graphics, Wes?

50:53.120 --> 50:54.120
Sublime.

50:54.120 --> 50:55.120
Intense.

50:55.120 --> 50:56.120
Titillating.

50:56.120 --> 50:57.120
Perfect.

50:57.120 --> 50:59.640
Yeah, and you're flying around in space like a madman.

50:59.640 --> 51:00.640
Space dogfights.

51:00.640 --> 51:01.640
I mean, what more could you ask?

51:01.640 --> 51:03.040
It's like Star Fox grew up.

51:03.040 --> 51:09.880
Yeah, it's Star Fox and Descent meet, I'm trying to remember what that old game was,

51:09.880 --> 51:10.880
Descent 2.

51:10.880 --> 51:14.240
I can't remember what the game was called, but this really just looks, this really looks

51:14.240 --> 51:15.440
like it's pushing my buttons.

51:15.440 --> 51:17.600
Now, Mr. Linux Gamer, have you seen this game?

51:17.600 --> 51:18.600
Have you seen this story?

51:18.600 --> 51:20.240
Yeah, I'm pretty hyped about it.

51:20.240 --> 51:21.520
I really like how it looks.

51:21.520 --> 51:24.480
I think it's going to be pretty interesting.

51:24.480 --> 51:26.120
Not too hyped about the early access though.

51:26.120 --> 51:27.120
I don't mind that.

51:27.120 --> 51:28.120
Yeah, yeah.

51:28.120 --> 51:29.320
It's always a mixed bag.

51:29.320 --> 51:32.520
What are your thoughts on it, on early access in general?

51:32.520 --> 51:37.880
I mean, I try and steer clear of giving reviews of early access games because they're not

51:37.880 --> 51:38.880
finished.

51:38.880 --> 51:41.520
It's kind of like why I haven't done a lot of open source games is because they're not

51:41.520 --> 51:42.520
always finished.

51:42.520 --> 51:44.200
Yeah, sure.

51:44.200 --> 51:48.680
I feel like this though will fill that Star Citizen void that I have until Star Citizen

51:48.680 --> 51:52.600
does ship for Linux, because I feel like this is the game that I can play for a while.

51:52.600 --> 51:56.640
I mean, one of the things I love about No Man's Sky under wine is just going up into

51:56.640 --> 52:01.120
space and flying around and blowing up stuff and getting the materials from it.

52:01.120 --> 52:07.120
So now I'll have this, so it's Everspace and it's going to be on Steam and GOG by Rocketfish

52:07.120 --> 52:08.120
Games.

52:08.120 --> 52:10.640
It's something to check out if you've got a few bucks laying around.

52:10.640 --> 52:13.720
It uses the Unreal Engine, which is damn good looking.

52:13.720 --> 52:20.120
It looks like right now it's on those platforms, it's 30 bucks US greenbacks, $29.99 is how

52:20.120 --> 52:21.120
much it is.

52:21.120 --> 52:23.800
Is there any other games, Gardner, that you're kind of looking forward to, big releases or

52:23.800 --> 52:28.080
ones that you have your eye on that you can't wait to install when it finally ships?

52:28.080 --> 52:33.480
So two games that I've been really interested in lately are What the Box, which is kind

52:33.480 --> 52:37.160
of like Garry's Mod Prop Hunt.

52:37.160 --> 52:40.840
It's kind of everyone is a prop and you're just a box and you run around.

52:40.840 --> 52:44.120
It's what Metal Gear Solid Online should have been.

52:44.120 --> 52:49.160
And then there's also, let's see, what's the other one, Cluster Truck.

52:49.160 --> 52:51.840
That looks like a very interesting game.

52:51.840 --> 52:55.940
It's a procedurally generated game where there's like a bunch of trucks and you just run on

52:55.940 --> 52:58.360
top of them as far as you can.

52:58.360 --> 52:59.360
It looks really fun.

52:59.360 --> 53:00.360
It does look fun.

53:00.360 --> 53:01.360
Race the truck.

53:01.360 --> 53:02.360
Yeah.

53:02.360 --> 53:04.880
That doesn't seem like a super complicated game to port over to Linux, so I would think

53:04.880 --> 53:05.880
that'd be coming.

53:05.880 --> 53:07.440
I love it just says, jump on trucks.

53:07.440 --> 53:12.000
It says it's going to be available on September 27th, which is just a few days away too.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.880
Mr. Tonell, you had a question for Gardner.

53:14.880 --> 53:15.880
Go ahead.

53:15.880 --> 53:21.720
Yeah, I was wondering if you're doing any plans, do any reviews for games like emulation.

53:21.720 --> 53:27.120
What do you think about games on emulations that are not technically for Linux native?

53:27.120 --> 53:32.240
Because I noticed that one of your recent videos was Aladdin.

53:32.240 --> 53:39.520
So I was just wondering, would you do a review that's not necessarily native?

53:39.520 --> 53:43.800
I've thought about it and I've talked to some of the people who watch my stuff and it's

53:43.800 --> 53:47.040
not really something that my viewers are probably interested in.

53:47.040 --> 53:52.240
Although, I definitely am going to cover GNOME games when it finally hits.

53:52.240 --> 53:53.240
Oh, that's good.

53:53.240 --> 53:54.240
Yeah.

53:54.240 --> 53:56.400
What do you think of GNOME games?

53:56.400 --> 53:59.000
I've been kind of hyped about it.

53:59.000 --> 54:04.760
From what I understand, it seems like a Mednafen front end, which is really interesting to

54:04.760 --> 54:06.920
me.

54:06.920 --> 54:13.280
I don't know if it actually can be used with a controller, which is something I'd be interested

54:13.280 --> 54:14.280
in seeing.

54:14.280 --> 54:18.000
Yeah, I really like the idea of...

54:18.000 --> 54:20.280
So you're not as skeptical about it as I am?

54:20.280 --> 54:21.280
No.

54:21.280 --> 54:25.600
I'm a big fan of GNOME anyway, so to have something like that...

54:25.600 --> 54:32.680
I mean, I do play emulators quite a bit and I'm interested in having a unified front end

54:32.680 --> 54:33.680
for it.

54:33.680 --> 54:34.680
Yeah.

54:34.680 --> 54:35.680
That is what I do like about it.

54:35.680 --> 54:36.680
Go ahead.

54:36.680 --> 54:37.680
What?

54:37.680 --> 54:39.040
Have you tried Lutrix?

54:39.040 --> 54:40.040
I haven't.

54:40.040 --> 54:41.320
I've never heard of that.

54:41.320 --> 54:46.040
It's basically a front end for games that you can create launchers for any game and

54:46.040 --> 54:48.440
it doesn't necessarily have to be an emulator or anything.

54:48.440 --> 54:51.760
It could be any game and it could be even a Steam game that just has a launcher connected

54:51.760 --> 54:52.760
to it.

54:52.760 --> 54:54.480
So it's all in one manager.

54:54.480 --> 54:55.480
Nice.

54:55.480 --> 54:57.840
I'm definitely going to check that out.

54:57.840 --> 54:58.840
So Gardner, you've...

54:58.840 --> 54:59.840
Oh, go ahead.

54:59.840 --> 55:00.840
Was there another question in there for him?

55:00.840 --> 55:01.840
I can wait.

55:01.840 --> 55:02.840
Yeah.

55:02.840 --> 55:10.120
Linux gamer, what's your view on speedrunning an app?

55:10.120 --> 55:14.880
I really enjoy watching speedrunners, especially like AGDQ.

55:14.880 --> 55:17.760
I follow mainstream gaming quite a bit.

55:17.760 --> 55:23.360
So when stuff like that pops up on Polygon or wherever else, I definitely check those

55:23.360 --> 55:24.360
out.

55:24.360 --> 55:25.360
I love speedrunning.

55:25.360 --> 55:26.360
I don't do it myself.

55:26.360 --> 55:27.360
I don't think I'm good enough.

55:27.360 --> 55:29.000
What is speedrunning?

55:29.000 --> 55:32.680
It's where you basically break a game to beat it as fast as possible.

55:32.680 --> 55:33.680
Oh yeah, okay.

55:33.680 --> 55:34.680
So exploiting glitches.

55:34.680 --> 55:35.680
I love it.

55:35.680 --> 55:36.680
I love watching those.

55:36.680 --> 55:37.840
I don't know if I'd want to do those, but I'd like watching them.

55:37.840 --> 55:38.840
They're fascinating to watch.

55:38.840 --> 55:41.560
Yeah, it really takes a lot of skill sometimes.

55:41.560 --> 55:44.360
I saw one guy play Super Mario 64.

55:44.360 --> 55:47.160
I think he beat it in about five minutes with one hand.

55:47.160 --> 55:48.160
Like he did.

55:48.160 --> 55:49.160
Oh man.

55:49.160 --> 55:50.160
He used one hand to play the game.

55:50.160 --> 55:51.160
It was awesome.

55:51.160 --> 55:52.160
So what do you think about...

55:52.160 --> 55:53.160
Oh, Ww, you have a question.

55:53.160 --> 55:54.160
Go ahead.

55:54.160 --> 55:55.160
Okay.

55:55.160 --> 56:01.120
So a lot of games that I've played on the Windows side and that are on Linux, like let's

56:01.120 --> 56:05.720
say Payday 2, they have a heavy modding community.

56:05.720 --> 56:14.000
And it seems like I would love to play Payday 2 or other games that have a good modding

56:14.000 --> 56:18.200
community, but it doesn't seem like that translates over.

56:18.200 --> 56:23.320
Do you think that's a hurdle to overcome in the future for gamers that want to game on

56:23.320 --> 56:29.800
Linux and want to be able to mod games and add different features or change the UI how

56:29.800 --> 56:31.720
they want?

56:31.720 --> 56:34.080
I definitely think that's important.

56:34.080 --> 56:38.720
One of the staples of PC gaming is definitely the modding community.

56:38.720 --> 56:43.400
I'm very excited to see that Unreal Tournament, the new one that's coming out, is going to

56:43.400 --> 56:45.240
support that.

56:45.240 --> 56:50.400
And I'm hoping that they create a modding platform that allows someone to just publish

56:50.400 --> 56:55.440
to the platform and then it works across Linux, Mac, and Windows.

56:55.440 --> 56:56.960
But yeah, it's very important.

56:56.960 --> 57:06.040
Games that support Steam Workshop on Windows and not on Linux, I dock them points when

57:06.040 --> 57:08.760
they do that.

57:08.760 --> 57:14.440
It's very important to me to maintain that kind of compatibility, especially since Linux

57:14.440 --> 57:18.960
is such a community-based initiative.

57:18.960 --> 57:28.640
So what is your sense of the take on developers and continuing support of Linux?

57:28.640 --> 57:30.160
Do you think it's increasing?

57:30.160 --> 57:34.840
Do you think developers have sort of had a cold reaction to SteamOS and maybe it's tapering

57:34.840 --> 57:35.840
off?

57:35.840 --> 57:38.240
What's your sense at this point?

57:38.240 --> 57:44.920
So it definitely boils down to the publisher, I think.

57:44.920 --> 57:54.680
Square Enix has been publishing games like Eidos and they're bringing Deus Ex to Linux

57:54.680 --> 57:59.760
and they've done a couple other games before, Life is Strange and stuff like that.

57:59.760 --> 58:07.240
And Take-Two has also kind of, or 2K I guess, has been bringing games to Linux.

58:07.240 --> 58:12.640
Certain developers need to be pushed a little more, I think.

58:12.640 --> 58:14.920
It's kind of a mixed bag, honestly.

58:14.920 --> 58:16.520
So it's still kind of early days then.

58:16.520 --> 58:17.520
Definitely.

58:17.520 --> 58:19.560
I guess that's where we'd expect it to be.

58:19.560 --> 58:23.520
I think there's room to grow, for sure.

58:23.520 --> 58:28.420
It's also, we're on the precipice of Vulkan taking off, we're going to be making a big

58:28.420 --> 58:29.600
display server transition.

58:29.600 --> 58:30.600
So it's maybe not-

58:30.600 --> 58:31.600
There's all this AMD work to try to get better.

58:31.600 --> 58:34.960
Yeah, maybe it's okay that it's still not, we have some time.

58:34.960 --> 58:35.960
We still have some time.

58:35.960 --> 58:38.700
And it's come a long way just in the past three or four years.

58:38.700 --> 58:39.700
That's true.

58:39.700 --> 58:40.700
It definitely has.

58:40.700 --> 58:43.680
I suspect that Valve has something else up their sleeve.

58:43.680 --> 58:48.320
They're not dumb and they understand that Windows is definitely trying to wall off the

58:48.320 --> 58:51.680
open garden that PC gaming has been.

58:51.680 --> 58:54.360
And they have to have something up their sleeve.

58:54.360 --> 59:01.360
I don't think they're going to go quietly into the universal Windows platform or whatever

59:01.360 --> 59:03.320
Windows is trying to push on us.

59:03.320 --> 59:04.800
Yeah, I think you're probably right.

59:04.800 --> 59:05.800
I hope.

59:05.800 --> 59:06.800
I hope.

59:06.800 --> 59:07.800
Lyle, you had a question before we wrap up.

59:07.800 --> 59:08.800
Go ahead.

59:08.800 --> 59:16.360
Oh, I was just going to ask, do you think, Garner, do you think that, sorry, I'm hearing

59:16.360 --> 59:17.360
echo.

59:17.360 --> 59:26.360
Anyways, do you think Steam is kind of a scapegoat for native Linux gaming because you're not

59:26.360 --> 59:35.120
really, in Steam, you're not really using the Linux desktop per se as a native client?

59:35.120 --> 59:38.760
I don't know if that made sense.

59:38.760 --> 59:40.600
Because you're using the Steam Runtime?

59:40.600 --> 59:41.600
Yeah.

59:41.600 --> 59:49.960
Do you think there's a way that we could convert programmers to make native clients instead

59:49.960 --> 59:52.480
of Steam?

59:52.480 --> 59:54.400
So that's an interesting question.

59:54.400 --> 59:59.520
I haven't actually heard that before, but I guess you can turn off the Steam Runtime,

59:59.520 --> 01:00:03.480
but it sometimes will break compatibilities with games.

01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:06.760
And if you're downloading games from like GOG or the Humble Store, they're going to

01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:12.240
be using like the native libraries on your system.

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:15.320
I don't know if I like the classification native.

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:18.960
I know that's the term we've been throwing around, but native makes it sound like it's

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:23.080
not a Linux developed code.

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:26.440
It's just, they're just libraries that shipped with an older version of Ubuntu.

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:27.440
That's what we're talking about here.

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:31.120
We're talking about things that were created for Linux, that are compiled for Linux.

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:36.360
They're just shipped with a, essentially, it actually makes a lot of sense, and I don't

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:40.760
know if you'd really want to do it differently, because it allows developers to target a single

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:45.480
target, Linux, Ubuntu, 1204, whatever it is now, I don't know.

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:52.200
And that is a real easy, okay, this is something I can wrap my head around, I can ship to that.

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:56.900
And then we as end users, if it bothers us, have the means, especially with distributions

01:00:56.900 --> 01:01:02.120
like Solace, have the means to switch over to our native distribution, now I'm using

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:06.600
that term again, to switch over to our distribution bundled libraries, if we want.

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:07.600
Right.

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:08.600
Comes with the package manager.

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:09.600
Yeah.

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:10.600
If we want.

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:11.600
And that's where something where it's like, maybe if you see more open source in games,

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:14.320
where it doesn't matter as much, because they can link when they're building all the

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:17.120
packages, maybe we see more static compilation in games.

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:19.880
But when you do have the Steam runtime, and you have all the Steam users, and you have

01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:23.200
the library, and the support services, and the cloud sync, and all that, I can see why

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:24.240
it's a popular target.

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:27.820
A game development shop needs some amount of predictability.

01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:33.080
You can't really ship a game without some level of predictability of what your target

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:36.260
system is going to be, and that's what the Steam runtime gives them.

01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:40.660
And it's something that I think Linux was missing, and it's not something that you are

01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:45.960
dependent on to have gaming on Linux, as Gardiner just pointed out, GOG or Humble Bundle games

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:50.160
as another real easy source to get games, don't use those runtimes.

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:55.580
And it's very simple on Arch and on Solace, and probably other distros, to flip a switch,

01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:57.460
and now you're using your built-in bundled runtimes.

01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:58.460
It does bring up libraries.

01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:02.280
It is important, then, for that runtime to see maintenance, upkeep, updates, that sort

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:06.280
of thing, to make sure that it's easy and not a hassle as we move forward on the Linux

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:07.280
desktop.

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.280
So that will be interesting to see what Steam does.

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:11.880
I don't necessarily disagree with you, Chris, at all.

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:22.760
I think Steam is a great intermediary between getting games on Linux and having them outside

01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:26.000
of Steam native, if you will.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.720
I agree with you that Steam is native, okay?

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:32.840
And the games are still Linux binaries at the end of the day.

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:35.440
I agree with that.

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:41.560
Running a program to run a game is the same in some respects as just using Wine, correct?

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:43.520
Because you're using a program to run the game.

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:46.360
Well, no, Steam doesn't run the game.

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:48.480
The game runs as native code on the system.

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:51.320
Steam might launch the game and authorize the game or something like that.

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:53.560
And include additional libraries that it uses.

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:56.160
So when the game starts, it starts on its own volition.

01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:00.920
I mean, Steam might kick it off, but then it runs its own process, and it uses its native

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:03.720
compiled Linux code, in most cases.

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:04.720
Okay.

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:09.880
And aren't Snap packages going to do something similar to that, where the developers are

01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:13.760
going to be able to publish their own libraries, or package their own libraries along with

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:14.760
their app?

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:21.880
Snap and Flatpaks are going to reimagine the runtime structure, so Linux will be that for

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:22.880
everything native.

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:25.120
Those are coming to a lot of things, yeah.

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:29.520
That's actually where I was going to go next.

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:38.880
If we got a community donating money to advancing Flatpaks or Snappaks or whatever for the development

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:48.360
of AAA games like WoW or SwoTor or any other huge MMO out there, then wouldn't that gain

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:55.600
more credibility to gaming on Linux?

01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:56.600
What's the difference, though?

01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:02.400
Because if you're creating a runtime that's making it easier to develop on it with Flatpaks

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:07.120
or Snaps, or you're creating a runtime with Steam as your base, what's the difference

01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:09.440
with it not being native and is native?

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:14.680
Because to me, it sounds like you're just kind of picking at straws, and it's totally

01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:18.800
native and you're kind of trying to imply that it's not.

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:27.320
I would say the conversation around runtimes is actually, that is a valid one.

01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:33.640
Because what is the point of having this always up to date, perfectly synced, rolling release

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:38.640
of a Linux distribution just to rely on runtimes that might be two years old or something like

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:39.640
that?

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:46.400
So Flatpaks today ship with GTK 3.20 version, right, that's what the base Flatpak runtime

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:47.560
GTK setup is.

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:52.680
Well, that's great today, but it's already going to be out of date in a couple of days

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:55.120
and practically speaking.

01:04:55.120 --> 01:05:02.040
And then really in a year or two, that's going to feel limiting when I might be on GTK 4.0

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:07.760
potentially at that point, and yet the Flatpak runtime will still support GTK 3.20, which

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:08.880
will probably also get upgraded.

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:13.920
But that runtime discussion we should probably have on a future date, because I got to run,

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:17.960
because it is time for me to start recording a special edition of On Filter coming up a

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:18.960
little bit.

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:19.960
What?

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:21.640
Yeah, Mr. Chase is in Shoreline right now as we record.

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:22.960
Oh, he's hot on the way.

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:23.960
I can see that.

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:26.200
He is, and I don't have clips ready yet.

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:27.840
So we have someone in his seat.

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:28.980
It's just a hot mess.

01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:31.520
So let's pick that conversation up on a future date.

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:34.840
But Gardiner, thank you for joining us on the Unplugged program.

01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:39.560
So we've got links to your Twitter account and your YouTube channel, but also to your

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:42.720
Patreon if people want to support the work you're doing on Patreon.

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:46.020
And please feel free, if you're ever bored on a Tuesday, come back, hang out, chime in

01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:47.800
with your awesome Linux opinions.

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:48.800
Totally.

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:49.800
You're always welcome back, sir.

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:50.800
So thanks for being here.

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:52.360
Thanks for having me, guys.

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:53.360
Absolutely.

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:54.780
I'm glad you were able to make time for it.

01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:58.960
And Wes's invitation extends out to you at home there, audience, if you'd like to join

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:00.360
us on a Tuesday.

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:01.600
Next week won't be the week to do it.

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:02.600
No, not next week.

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:05.400
In fact, big disclaimer to you guys in the Mumba Room, check the calendar page, because

01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:08.040
Wes and I, we got a date.

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:09.040
We're going down to the-

01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:10.040
You better treat me right, Chris.

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:11.040
You better treat me right.

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:12.120
Just saying right there.

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:15.800
We're going down to the Open Daylight Summit, which is something the Linux Foundation is

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:16.800
putting on.

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:21.520
And it's all about software-defined networking and Linux, which is a huge area that's growing

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:22.640
for Linux like crazy.

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:24.960
But it's really happening down at the infrastructure level.

01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:28.040
It's not really something that we have a lot of eyes on.

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:29.320
And users haven't seen too much yet.

01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:30.320
Yeah.

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:33.880
So Wes and I are going to try to attend that and come back with the bits and pieces that

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:38.120
you probably actually would care about and want to know about and see how well Linux

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:40.040
is dominating or not.

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:41.440
So those are things we'll be doing next week.

01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:47.560
But here's the catch, happens during the unplugged lifetime.

01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:48.560
So when we would normally-

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:49.560
Who schedules things like that?

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:50.560
Come on.

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:51.560
Doesn't Linux Foundation-

01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:54.200
Don't they watch the Jupiter Broadcasting calendar, Wes?

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:59.760
So we, right now, are tentatively planning to have a later recording.

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:05.120
So maybe more like four o'clock JB time, something like that, a couple hours later.

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:09.800
So we can go down there, get the interviews, get everything recorded, hustle back up here,

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:13.080
edit it all together, and then put together a masterpiece for you.

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:18.960
Take many hours of interviews and condense it down to a few minutes of actually interesting

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:19.960
bits.

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:20.960
The hot shit.

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:21.960
Yeah.

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:22.960
That's very well put.

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:23.960
And that'll be next week's unplugged.

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:25.440
So the time's going to be all jabberwonky.

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:28.220
But we'll try to let you know as soon as we have some good time.

01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:31.120
So we'll put it up at JupiterBroadcasting.com slash calendar as soon as we know.

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:32.640
I apologize for that.

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:33.840
Thank you for sticking with us.

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:38.660
But the idea is we'll go down to the event, we'll get it all done, and we'll come back

01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:44.000
all still fresh from the event with everything on our mind and sit down and have, hopefully,

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.340
a good tale to weave, I suppose.

01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:49.000
And you guys should go check it out too and maybe comment on the subreddit if there's

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.220
anything you want us to really pay attention to or people we should go try to track down

01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:53.860
and you're curious about, let us know.

01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:57.360
And if you're going to be in the area Tuesday and you're going to be at the Open Daylight

01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:58.600
Summit, come find us.

01:07:58.600 --> 01:07:59.600
We'll be walking around.

01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:00.600
Come say hi.

01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:04.320
We'd be happy to shake a hand or two and chat a little bit with you.

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:05.320
See what you're doing.

01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:06.320
See what you're up to.

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:09.920
So JupiterBroadcasting.com slash calendar is where we have our new live time for just

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:10.920
next week.

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:14.200
We're just making a change for next week.

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:18.240
And you can just check there and there's an RSS feed if you want to.

01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:19.240
And you know what?

01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:22.920
If you're not a live timer, if you don't watch live, you don't go to jblive.tv, you don't

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:27.680
have the Roku app, you don't watch it on MPVs using the RTMP stream.

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:28.680
I understand.

01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:29.680
I understand.

01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:30.960
You're not watching on the YouTube live shirt.

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:31.960
No, that's cool.

01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:35.120
Because what you do is you subscribe to the RSS feed and then you automatically get the

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:38.240
unplugged program every freaking time we have a new release.

01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:40.120
It's this brand new technology.

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:41.840
It's just brand spanking new.

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:43.480
I think Twitter invented it.

01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:44.480
I'm not sure.

01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:49.280
It's called the really simple syndication and they just added this new enclosure tag,

01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:50.280
Wes.

01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:51.280
It's incredible.

01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:52.280
What?

01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:53.280
Oh my god.

01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:56.960
So now you can get downloaded files via RSS and then people have created these podcast

01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:57.960
players.

01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:58.960
Oh man, Wes.

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:00.520
I can't wait to tell you about it, but we got to run.

01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:01.520
So I'll have to tell you after the show.

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:02.520
Be here next week.

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:03.520
Yeah.

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:05.200
I'll tell you the whole world about podcast apps.

01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:06.200
It's amazing.

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:08.200
We're really on the top of things.

01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:14.160
If you'd like to join us though, we will have that mumble room live so you can tune in next

01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:15.160
week.

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:16.160
Join us live.

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:17.160
Hang out in the mumble room and chat with us.

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:19.240
LinuxActionShow.reddit.com is where you go for feedback.

01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:24.600
Thanks for being here and we'll see you next Tuesday, probably, assuming we get up here

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:25.600
in time from Seattle.

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:26.600
I don't really know.

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:27.600
Roll the dice.

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:28.600
This shit won't work out.

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:29.600
Oh god, Wes.

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:30.600
Get it out of here.

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:31.600
I never installed GNU slash Linux.

01:09:31.600 --> 01:10:00.920
I secretly use Arch Linux.

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:14.200
Wes has got this Sputnik Dell laptop that he just, it really just gets loaded with stuff

01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:16.520
all the time, really for purposes of the show.

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:21.940
But every now and then, the man has the opportunity to load an OS, to load a desktop, to load

01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:24.160
a distribution just for himself.

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:25.160
This is true.

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:27.840
And I think the last time you did this, didn't you do Antigros?

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:30.200
Well, it was Apricity for quite a while.

01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:33.160
You actually, you did Apricity for the show and then stayed there.

01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:35.160
Yeah, it really wasn't too bad.

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:36.160
But not anymore.

01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:37.160
Well, I did try.

01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:40.800
I did upgrade because they had another release or another beta out or something, so I did

01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:41.800
try it.

01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:48.920
I was having a very strange issue where my backlight would just flash, just intense flickering.

01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:51.640
And this is nothing, that's not the Skylake Sputnik, right?

01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:54.040
It's like, everything should be well supported.

01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:57.040
Yeah, and normally, right now, the screen is not flickering.

01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:02.840
So I don't know if I can blame it on Apricity or just a random kernel version, library version,

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:03.840
who knows.

01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:04.840
It is a rolling release.

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:05.840
So I didn't investigate it too hard.

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:06.840
I was playing around with Antigros.

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:12.640
I usually have five Antigros live CDs or USBs laying around, and I was playing with their

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:14.480
bootloader and I was playing with their live CD.

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:18.680
And I like to do fun things like download it and then loop back mount into the ISO so

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:23.080
you can do it, or copy the ISO into RAM so you can do it all easily without needing USB

01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:24.080
or it's faster.

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:25.080
Yeah, you're crazy.

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:26.080
I know you.

01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:30.920
And it just reminded me, just playing with extracting the ISO and looking at how they

01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:36.080
do the init RAMFS, and it's just enough different from Arch that it's kind of outside of my

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:37.480
comfort zone.

01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:40.320
And I like all the way it's set up, but I started getting frustrated too that sometimes

01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:45.520
the Antigros mirrors for the Google TrueType fonts and their other fonts, some of their

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:49.720
extra packages are really slow to download, even though they take the time to update all

01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:50.720
your Arch mirrors and stuff.

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:51.720
Yeah, yeah.

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:52.720
And I'm like, what am I?

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:55.080
It just didn't feel like the fine grained control that I wanted.

01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:57.920
So I just wiped it and installed Arch straight away.

01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:58.920
Vanilla Arch.

01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:01.400
Well, then we might chat more about that.

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:02.400
Huh.

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:03.400
So how's it working so far?

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:04.400
Oh, it's beautiful.

01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:07.360
You know, there's like that you have to give yourself that like hour or two hours to get

01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:08.760
stuff going.

01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:10.640
But after that, I'm really – it's not quite there yet.

01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:14.080
I need to get a bunch of the like YubiKey GPG stuff set up, which I haven't.

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:19.180
I need to re-get like my TinkVPN and SyncThing and maybe play with some LibreVault, get that

01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:20.180
going here too.

01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:23.320
Anything been a challenge that you didn't expect or anything odd during setup?

01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:26.640
Because, you know, the only thing I ever find when I'm building my own machine or my own

01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:33.480
Arch install versus like Antigros or Apricity or Manjaro is there's usually one or two

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:38.640
defaults that don't really make sense in a desktop config that you end up having to

01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:39.640
go tweak or change.

01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:40.640
I think there will be.

01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:44.600
I have not heavily – just right now I've got a few extensions, like a little bit of

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:47.280
theming, but I haven't like gone and tweaked a bunch of stuff.

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:55.600
But also, setting up a bare Linux box is so much easier – not to downplay what you did

01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:58.380
– but it's so much easier than it was back in the days when you used to have to manually

01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:04.320
configure X and manually configure all of your init system and manually set up all of

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:06.160
the basic stuff.

01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:09.440
Now, you know, X auto-configures itself.

01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:11.360
SystemD takes care of tons of things.

01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:17.360
It is – building a Linux box from scratch is – depending on how you define scratch,

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:19.600
has gotten so much easier than it was a few years ago.

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:20.600
I know.

01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:21.880
And I love how Arch kind of exposes that.

01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:25.800
So it's like, okay, well, you format your things, you dump all your packages to the

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:32.680
file system, configure a few things, add yourself a user, enable GDM, install GNOME if you want,

01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:35.400
and hey, now you've got a desktop.

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:36.840
That is pretty cool.

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:40.560
So what happens when you have to try another distro?

01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:44.520
Well, see, that's one of the things I want to do, too, is before – I think it all started

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:47.760
– I had to wipe the whole hard drive to install some distros, but somehow, I think

01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:55.000
from one of the installer GUIs, it had set it up GPT on MBR, or maybe it was the opposite.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.000
I don't know.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000
It was configured in a weird way.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:02.560
So now it's nice and UEFI and it's GPT, so I'm not limited by how many primary partitions

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:03.560
I can have.

01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:04.560
Like, it's the 80s.

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:08.400
So it should be perfect so I can install a whole crap-ton of OSes for us to review on

01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:09.400
the show.

01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:10.960
Nice dig.

01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:11.960
Yes.

01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:12.960
Cool.

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:13.960
Well, congrats on the new fresh installation.

01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:14.960
Oh, thank you.

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:15.960
That's always fun.

01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:20.040
I've been recently reloading a box of my own, and every time I do it, I try things

01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:21.040
just slightly differently.

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:22.040
Just a little tweak.

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:23.040
Right, exactly.

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:40.320
So you're like, hmm, what's new this time around?
